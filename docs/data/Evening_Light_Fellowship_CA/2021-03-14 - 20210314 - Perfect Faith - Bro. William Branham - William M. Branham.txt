can see that they're there amen it's not faith it's sight amen so we thank god for the sight of of the believers and for the others were considering faith that they are there at home and tuned in to the william not the will and better home page but our the church homepage amen and i trust by grace that they're there to hear the word of god amen they're there to make their calling and election sure by the word amen this is not this is a well we got to do it we got to do it but let's let's judge ourselves by the word and the power of god did say the pulpit right here he says the judgment seat of god and when the words going forth god is judging you by that word it's not the ministry judging you god's judging you and to and this morning the lord willing we're going to have a a tape by brother branham and we we have played it not too long ago but i want to share with you again and uh should also share some thoughts with you because uh the message is perfect faith and there are other messages here but we could go on until tonight but we'll try it by the grace of god just to keep it the way that he wants it and these are the ones that i wanted to emphasize this one here is perfect faith and this one heirs works his faith expressed amen and again the rapture amen message god give us i pray the perfect revelation of the rapture faith is not a feeling no no faith is is the revelation of god and you believe the revelation of god so i pray grace that will amen make our calling election sure by the word on the message on perfect faith we've heard it but let's hear it again and let's judge ourselves by that word again and let's see it lord oh yeah i believe now i got more faith yes lord my getting i'm getting into that perfect faith amen because if you read the book or if you hear the tape well that's good but go back and do it again and again and again because we need it to make our calling election sure to make sure that we have what god is looking for and what you and i need because without this perfect fate and especially concerning the resurrection rapture we won't make it and brother because it's all it's going to be by faith and you consider the chapter in the bible the faith chapter hebrews 11 by faith by faith it goes on and on and on and on amen regardless of the individual regardless of the age the thing that god was looking for was faith was the revelation of what he had revealed to them amen that's the perfect faith in what god has revealed to you in your day in your hour that's oh if i believe that and i'm going forth lining up with it that's perfect faith so you come right on down to the to the bright message amen concerning the rapture concerning the resurrection amen oh lord we got the revelation of it we're in we're in that hour now but that's that's the perfect faith that god is looking for us to stand on amen to express in what we in in the lives that we live as luther expressed perfect faith for that age amen that's what god wanted to have amen and he got into it and brother in the eyes of god is perfect faith luther wesley the pentecostals but now we're in the bright age and maybe sometime soon that we'll consider you know uh what went on with luther and wesley and all the others in the pentecost and but there was a change everything changed and and the revival just died down the revival that luther had went down the revive of that pen that even pentecost had it just went down yeah so what happened the truth was still there but their zeal and their enthusiasm wasn't there and now it's the same with the message now i said lord i said help us to compare what's going on now around the message you know with what happened in luther's day wesley's day and so on so we know that that it began to go downhill the people were going downhill spiritually more and more and more and so i'm recognizing what happened in all other ages i'm recognizing that it's happening around the message because that zeal and that enthusiasm is not there like it used to be oh yeah we thank the lord for it praise the lord yeah but if if it's faith in our hearts we have a zeal we have an enthusiasm we have a love oh we have the power the anointing and we just can't get the the true bride can't get away from it the true bride is hungering thirsting amen because like like like the pentecostals oh my they kept going looking for the baptism the baptism and the gift the baptism and the gift the power and the anointing to finally it just become a creed and a doctrine and oh i believe it yeah you've got to believe it go go and manifest it you know luther manifested justification the sanctification the baptism that gives well what's god looking for in you amen brother that's right what's god looking for in me is he is he seeing is he seeing it in you and in me and brother the thing of it is oh we can't blame god and say oh lord you didn't give us the faith he did he did give us the faith by the grace of god amen but again is the faith controlling us or are we true are we trying to control the faith amen oh brother yeah so i'll tell you this to say that what happened to the same spirit they got around the methodists and the lutherans and the pentecostals any denomination and it's all a form of godliness oh yeah they still believed in the gifts they believed in the baptism they believed this oh yeah but the zeal and the enthusiasm wasn't there and it's not definitely not there now and i know that the zeal and the enthusiasm that was around this message when i first come to the message it's not there now yeah and brother brown was experiencing that before the lord took him home well he knew it even even even he felt that this it wasn't striking believers the way that it should he said was striking him the way that it should but again there's a generation rising that it should strike us and it should control us it not sure it will if we really believe it in our hearts it will control us by the grace of god and that we're going to live live live for the revelation we're living for that faith amen but there's too many believers oh that it's just going to church denominations i go to church they preach the message yeah but do you believe the message as we go into this tape on perfect faith and we've heard it before judge yourself by it amen let us see lord i want that perfect faith or lord i believe i've got it i believe i'm on my way lord i'm i'm feeding on the word that's giving me more and more perfect faith and lord i i'm i'm gonna make by calling election sure based on that perfect faith amen oh yeah based on what god has done and what god is doing and what god will do amen so where are we in the spirit of what god has done and what god is doing by the grace of god and we know that we're in a bride revival and the prophet of god did say he said no he said the bride revival is not going to seem like a revival right because it's not looking down here it's looking up amen for the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of god amen and your lives are going to reflect that i'm not getting too involved with in this when i'm not getting too involved in that i'm just living for the lord i'm living for the resurrection i'm living with the rapture lord because that's the only thing left to happen now for the gentile amazing this is absolutely amazing that we we we know that we are in that hour in that age amen when god has made his last move to give us the faith that we need for the resurrection rapture come home amen and brother as i said there in luke where he said go and ask this one ask that one ask that one to come to the marriage supper oh oh they couldn't they couldn't go to the marriage number because they were doing this they couldn't get get too involved with that because they were doing this and so on so finally jesus said go out into the highways and byways amen and he said call them in oh yeah they were they were more than ready more than willing a man and a great a greater willingness than hunger and thirst for it and to want to do it when they considered oh my the king of kings and lord of lords coming down to the to the to the marriage supper of his son our lord jesus christ amen brother getting out of the feelings they had into the faith amen based on the revelation of the marriage supper based on the revelation of the bridegroom and the bride oh it's going to be wonderful praise the lord so i pray god help us to judge ourselves again by the word that we're going to hear again and no doubt you might have read it and you may have heard the tape a few times well let's hear it again amen and we're not going to add to it not take away from it see it's the same thing again it's it's the word revealed praise the lord amen by god by the grace of god and it doesn't change he's not going to change it it's so it's predestinated it's it's ordained for this hour for this age because we need it but it's not mentioned it concerning other agents but this one will the lord have a problem amen in dealing with the people with perfect faith why because he said when the son of man comes will he find faith and the faith he's looking for is not just i believe god or i believe in god the faith he's looking for is those that believe in the whole body of revealed truth amen and if you do you know where you are amen that you're not in the alpha you're in the omega you're not in the in luther wesley and pentecost no we're going on now it's the final the final phase amen there's god's not going to do anything else for the gentiles amen so i pray grace to make our calling election sure that amen in the presence of god now amen so i'll tell you what we call for what what is the elect for oh lord that's right it's the resurrection it's the rapture at the time we're not going to condemn those out there in in those churches no it's like i said they're the called but they're not the chosen for the bride but they're going to be there outside the city and i'll tell you this the bride's not going to just be in the earth and the people think the bride's gonna be you know we sit with them any strong they're gonna be in in in that part of the the the kingdom oh yeah and then do you think that's gonna be bright outside the throne no that's why the problem oh i like it that's why the prophet said he said we can't get this we're not going to get this message to everybody only the bride that's right but he said that again the gospel is going out there concerning the basic revelation of jesus and it's going to go to all the earth everywhere amen all right that's going to bring forth the many that are called amen but and god and god looks for a certain faith in them but brother the faith he's looking for in them is not the faith he's looking for in you and me so god's grace to us let us be judge or judge ourselves again let god judge us by the word concerning perfect faith amen and again the power of god preached this after the opening of the seals in august of 1963 by the grace of god and we're going to we go into it we just want to go into page start at page four and finish with page 29 and i think the it'll oh yeah right now there's a 35 pages but we're going to go from 4 to 29 by the grace of god and it'll be just around 65 minutes amen so god help us to really concentrate on it really focus on it and not apply it to somebody else apply it to yourself amen lord i need this i need this revelation i need to know it so lord i pray grace don't let me don't let me just take it for granted or just a doctrine or that's the prophet now he's preaching this and preaching that no indeed it's like as i said on the on the internet there they have these videos of brother jack cole preaching and like i said when i turned that on and i knew it was exactly in the same building the same platform and the same people behind him amen that was there when we when we see brother branham's video the black and white of brother branham there amen and brother brown ministers and that's praying for the sick there oh but jack cole was also praying for the sick now jack cole was and maybe this is the way the lord took our brother jack call home at so early in age he was 38 or 39 when the lord took him wipe because our brother jack oh my the time to make his calling election sure oh my he he knew god he believed god and i tell you this he knew the devil amen and and he and he was rebuking the devil he was fighting the devil he wasn't there to entertain this one or this one this one he was in a battle and that's why the brother jack cole when people come up first pray pray for the sick or oh he would just look at him and get away satan get out of here he knew that the real satan was to him amen and he knew to the devil now he said in the name of jesus get out of here amen and another time a sister came up and she had a bad back and she had this problem and that problem and jack cole was going to pray for her and he said sister he said stand up and and so on he was he was very very blunt with it when it comes to faith and he took that woman and he got behind her and he put he put his knee knee up into her back and he pulled her back he says you're all right he said that devil's gone amen he cast the devil out and he proved it amen praise the lord so we thank god for our brother jackhole's ministry and of course uh brother brown appreciated that brother too but at the eye at the age of 39 the lord took him home amen because god wanted the emphasis to move to the word amen to the prophetic ministry of william branham amen because the other ministry started to go downhill as well and that was our brother jack and our brother allen tia losbin and our brother oral roberts and and many others when it comes to evangelists and i remember that one of the one of the many was going around the world at that time was here in newfoundland in fact he was in the church and having revival in in a church in bishop in lewisport now bishop falls in lewisport and it was a church that's just just at the beginning just off the highway and so they had a special meeting one time and this brother came i can't recall his name right now but he was one of the evangelists that was right here at the time of william branham amen oral roberts and billy graham so and it was uh oh yeah he preached the word and he might have mentioned even william branham you know and uh because they really appreciated brother branham's ministry and the faith that he had oh yeah oh yes that brother that was it that brother that was in amen we know who came amen and that brother that preached in the church in little sport amen oh yeah he remembered brother branham and he knew brother branham and he oh yeah he and he was he wasn't afraid to express it that he was at absolute confidence in the ministry of william branham amen amen oh yeah and he i think he mentioned him at uh sometimes there when when i was attending those meetings in lewisport so i thank god for it amen and there was something else too that came up and uh e i like it oh yeah he was the brother that said he said listen he said right now in the world today he said there's over a hundred evangelists hundred and some money evangelists and he said we're going here we're doing this we're doing this but he said there's no way that we can compare to william branham amen oh yeah he said listen he said we're doing this oh my but he said and it takes all of us we're all doing this we're all doing that we're all doing that and he said here comes william branham oh my he steps on the platform the anointing is there the power of god is there this one's healed that one's ill he said he doesn't he's not screaming he's not bawling he's not shaking them and doing this with him he said so he told him when he when he was uh gathering together with those ministering brethren sometimes and he said listen i think he mentioned 120 of us he said can't compare he said to william branham oh yeah so and god will bless him for that amen no doubt he's gone on now i pray god rest his soul amen but if there's anything oh yeah brother brown did have perfect faith that's right i believe that and brother and he shared it with us god through the prophet was sharing the perfect faith with us he shared us this faith this faith this faith until we come right down to perfect faith for the rapture we need it so we'll we'll go into the prophet and as he ministers on perfect faith amen and let's say lord lord that's me amen lord i recognize my need amen amen by the grace of god so lord yes lord help us get into the revelation of perfect faith and listen it's not a feeling that's right no it's not feeling it what it is what is perfect faith it's the perfect revelation of god amen for your age for your day amen and well the what luther had was a perfect revelation amen oh yeah for that age amen and then god went on and and wesley hungered and thirsted for that perfect faith amen he got it pentecostal what they had was perfect because that's what god wanted them to have in their day and in their hour amen so are we rejoicing in and praising god and worshiping based on that perfect faith for this day amen what god wants to give us in this hour and what god has given us in this hour not what wesley had or luther at all god's already proven that that's right and we believe it and go on amen yeah go on oh yeah well i'm justified i'm sanctified i'm baptized with the holy ghost i have access to the gifts too oh yeah what what about what what about now what about the the resurrection rapture oh oh that wasn't in the pentecostal message that wasn't in luther's message or wesley's message that wasn't in the this group or that group no where did it come from the opening of the word and the revealing of the mystery of god amen see we're at the end we're finished and god has revealed himself reveal himself reveal himself and to the gentiles oh my look what god has done these last 2 thousand years and now let's finish amen see it's like egypt israel going down to egypt there was a time when they went down time they went under slavery but then at the time when they came back they they were going to go out amen and i pay i know the holy spirit was there to create in their hunger their hearts a hunger and a thirst for deliverance and god said i've heard the cries of my people amen and brother does god hear her cry for the resurrection does god hear our cry for the rapture amen so brother concerning the revelation of what god has done what god has given us brother is he getting the results that he's looking for because he did say when the son of man comes will he find peace that's right amen amen and again i agree with our brother in the translation of this bible and he said it's not a personal faith he said it's a belief in the whole body of revealed truth why because god because that's needed to give us the faith that he wants us to have in this hour amen amen don't stay with luther wesley at the pentecost that's why they're going to be outside the city amen because they're just they're just involved in what god did in the past amen years and years and years ago but they're not getting into what god has revealed and done in this hour in this age and as our brother jonathan mentioned the other night that the problem of god's been gone for about 55 years yeah and i said lord how close are we to the resurrection how close we to the rapture lord please in the name of jesus help us amen then it's getting cooler and cooler and colder and cold amen around the message the zeal is not there well they got zeal for this and zeal for that but how many got the zeal for the rapture that's right how many got a zeal enthusiasm for the resurrection don't be looking for this thank god for that move on thank god for that move on and brother when it comes to the the faith for of the rapture and the resurrection thank god for it the only way we can move on is into eternity amen now move on to another hour and not move on to another age not move on to another oh hopefully another ministry that god will send no no no power god when they asked when they asked the prophet as i said questions and answers on the seals will the bride have a ministry yes he said it's been there since 2000 years ago he said it was there he said back when he started on the day of pentecost and he says the five-full ministry and just think i don't understand how a person can can can just bypass the ministry under this message and move on and say well god the prophet did this the prophet said that i don't need a i don't need a teacher i don't need a pastor i don't need a an evangelist i don't need you know apostles oh don't brother why are they there they're there amen for a reason oh most definitely so let's not get get out of the out of out of the out of the way or the purpose for which god has given the ministry but you've got to respect the ministry amen you've got to acknowledge the lord i believe you're in the ministry amen sure this again that's part of the perfect faith oh yeah perfect faith and like i said a person that just looked down their noses at somebody out there because they're denominational christians uh they don't have perfect faith the person that got that attitude doesn't have perfect faith not by any means no as the problem god said he said if i went if i was traveling and i went somewhere and he said and i was there on a sunday and he said i would maybe looking for a message church and he said if there was no message church he said i would go to the pentecostal church that's what he said back 55 years ago or more oh yeah and yet people all might they wouldn't wouldn't consider united pentecost pentecostal of newfoundland or whatever the organization they wouldn't consider this this or independent no they're not going to go anywhere oh yeah and knowing that there are believers that have traveled around the world practically and brother and they've been here and been there and not even go to a message church probably said he go to pentecost amen not only that again as that brother that was with me one time and we're discussing certain things with another brother and and he brought up the issue that that brother didn't call this man a brother he was a message preacher but the preacher we were talking about just just looked down his nose at him and he wouldn't call him brother and so this this brother that was with me at the time and he said brother he said you won't say brother to this pastor you won't call his wife sister and i told i told them that that years ago that wife that that pastor and his wife i said they don't recognize you they don't respect you that's first when i come to the message and he said what do you mean i said i said you're not you're not brother so-and-so and sister so-and-so i said you're just the first name oh that's so on that's the one just first name they would never call him brother yeah and so this brother with corrected him and he said brother he said the pope or the prophet said he called the pope brother that's right he said i won't do this and kiss his finger and all that gives his ring but he said i call him brother amen praise the lord it's like jesus you know talking about the scribes and the pharisees you know and but he said do as they say but don't do as they do amen by the grace of god so let's keep our attitude right and our spirit right oh i tell it that's when he comes when he finds that kind of a faith amen amen a right attitude and a right spirit you're reaching out to them amen if not bride you're reaching out just to give them god's blessing amen sure if you're not bride just the bible says it's a strong god to support the weak amen just think the bible acknowledges there's going to be these these and these and these in god's calling now he said i want you to support the weak and encourage them by the grace of god amen so bear with me uh brother baum said just before he went into perfect faith message and revelation he said i get spells too he said you know i get moody he said i get to a spot to where he said what gets me is where do i get to these spells when i get all overworked and satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you and he says you really haven't got a friend in the world remember i'm not immune to the temptation and he said see i got to overcome that and if the prophet overcame it we gotta overcome it amen by the word just stay with the word encourage yourself with with what god is doing amen amen and that he's given you the revelation of what he's doing he's giving you the revelation of what he wants you to look for and hunger and thirst for amen and he said again you know what the bible said they could say nothing amiss but the man was standing right in their midst of whom the miracle was done on and he said it puts satan to a shame amen brother don't let him put us to a shame put him to a shame amen rebuke him with the word jesus gave us that perfect example when satan tempted him he didn't go do this do this no he just gave him the word get thee behind me satan thou shall not tempt the lord thy god amen amen don't do this don't do that amen oh yes think when when after 40 days he was hungry and the devil said we'll turn this stone into into a loaf of bread and he said to satisfy your hunger oh yeah so are we going to do that do they do what we're looking for spirit naturally or we're going to just move it aside and go on spiritually oh brother there's two men focusing that there's too many focusing on the natural things not the spiritual amen so he said you take your stand and so on he said it put satan to a shame doesn't it amen and he said does god raise the dead he said here sits a man right here raised from the dead amen god heal the sick oh my he the hands could just go everywhere god heals the sick and we god help us if you're sick and you need the touch of the lord please believe amen don't focus on the negative don't focus on the symptoms focus on faith that's right amen keep believing keep praying amen he said god heal the sick yes oh my said the hands could just go everywhere god heals the sick and we know he's the great i am not the great i was or not the great i will be i am i am and he said that's ever present everywhere the same yesterday today forever now he said to hurry let's turn now he said i want to read a passage and just turn me around when i read it amen god's grace that what we're hearing tonight are hearing this this morning by the prophet on perfect faith he's going to turn us around and if you're if you're not not if you're not lining up with this lining up with that just say lord help me help me to believe with a complete belief lord don't let me doubt please in the name of jesus don't let me doubt amen so the prophet goes in to read the scripture and then goes in to preach perfect faith amen and you think you would read hebrews 11. no he goes to saint mark chapter 11 amen to preach perfect faith and it was in hebrews 11 that he that that the apostle paul goes and expresses faith right from the beginning right from the fall right on down to the end amen to preach he said be certain fearful oh sorry and he said and these all having obtained a good report through faith you want a good report you want you want god to show you his grace faith brings god under the sea he gives the he gives the word amen to what for to give us the faith that he's looking for and then it brings him on to see amen and says all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise but they had faith they believed god they trusted god are you going to believe god and trust god and he said god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect but with us they're perfect amen and brother that's the the past generation was just looking forward to the future generation someone's going to rise to do this someone's going to rise to do that thank god amen brother the perfect faith that god requires for the resurrection and the rapture is going to be in the end time bride amen grace of god to us is my prayer and again in hebrews chapter 11 faith faith is everything amen oh yeah in our relationship with god it's all all around faith faith faith we live by faith walk by faith talk by faith amen all faith grace and what is faith it's the revelation yeah it's a real it's not a feeling oh yeah i got it i got it no no speak the word amen praise the lord faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen amen for by it the elders obtained a good report and by it the the bride obtains a good report amen as they believe that amen the bride believes for the resurrection of the rapture listen if there's anything we need it's a new body i have been redeemed and i said i am being redeemed amen amen by the grace of god but we got to let go and let god have his way by grace amen so the lord bless you and sorry to keep sister mourinho so long we'll go right into the tape brother matthew amen and uh as i said it will be it starts on page four and i assume let's certainly see yeah paragraph 17 that's where he begins to read his scripture amen so lord bless you as we go to the word amen 11th chapter of saint martin and we're going to begin to read about the the 22nd verse of the 11th chapter of saint mark and many of you know this scripture it's very familiar it was a scripture i was thinking on uh brother russell when those when he spoke to me and said about those squirrels and they that was just the very scripture i was thinking of it's always been a puzzle he said if ye say not if i say if you say now let us read jesus answering said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those saints which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith and therefore i say unto you what things so every you desire when you pray believe that ye receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praise forgive if you have ought against any that your father also that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door yeah we see it but we want to see more of it we wanted such a flow that it'll it'll be a help to us to flow out to others remember jesus as we had in the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was set for and you think sometimes why would a man that was so full of power like him would have ever be sick yes sir i've read and some books somewhere where when he raised up that boy for the widow's son from nan i believe that prince the house of david that he stepped on a rock and thrown with a headache he bore our infirmities bear means to pack them and he had all things and like we have he had sickness he had temptations he had trouble he had flusteration just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator so he had to be partakers the husband and of the fruit before you even know the woman has to well and many things see if we look right into the scripture i want to say that i believe every scripture never been up to this room there's critics today that don't want to believe that a critic once said that when jesus said there was disciples to where that colt was tied or two ways met that he pre-arranged that for where that quote was timed see they don't understand that god pre-arranges god told me other day was brother down here that i would shake his hand on the street again that's very strange i wasn't here that morning but two minutes longer or a minute longer i not met him on the street but i stepped off the car just in time to shake his hands when he was coming in on the street he didn't know me he had his glasses off he couldn't see me when he heard my voice he started crying what was it usually he doesn't do that but it was the answer to what was told him up there under the oxygen tent he would do it i said you were also set in the church again his heart's desire when he was having chicago meeting he wanted to come to that meeting his heart was part i sent him a telegram of greetings for us and the children told him was praying that he could get well right quick and a loving brother who visits him said that you he just wanted to come so bad but here he said tonight see that was not pre-arranged the same god arranges he makes everything work perfectly on the dollar amen a critic once said that no wonder jesus could take five loaves and feed five thousand said the loaves were bigger in that day and he just cut each loaf to feed a thousand i'll give you to understand a little boy had it in his lunch a little child packed five rows of bread that could feed five deeply then what about the twelve basketballs taking that fast oh they just that's just critics that's all that doesn't change god's word it's just the same thing moving on now we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith perfect faith that's a great thing now a faith we're told in the bible faith cometh by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe is there that really nothing else will declaration but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for this prayer line the next few minutes now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and it's impossible to to please god without faith you cannot please and if you say you believe god you have never seen him see so then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith see anything that the sentence declares is no more faith it's a scientific fact see it's not no more faith but you have to accept him by faith and he that cometh to god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word of god amen see you must first believe this is god's word and you must come to god by the word evan sees just take the word what it says and that's right everything else contrary to it is not right abraham had to believe just what that boss told him and when he was 100 years old 25 years later he was stronger believing it was 25 years ago when it was given to me he believed it and he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god knowing that he was able to perform what he promised that's why everyone must be that way you must come with an unfailing faith believing that god made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that faith and that's what we're going to talk about they receive that faith in hebrews the book of hebrews 11th chapter we're told that faith is the substance of things so far now here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for because they take faith to be something that it is not see they don't believe it it's not a imagination it is a actual substance now listen close see it is not what you imagine it's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else it's just as real as my eyes says this is a piece of paper it's just as real as to say that but that is a lie it's just as real as the that i feel my coat it's just as real as the as i hear that baby talking uh there or making this noise see it's just that real it's music playing it's just as real as i taste anything in my mouth it is that real only you can't show it to somebody else you have alone amen it's yours faith is the substance amen see it's not just a myth so many people call now these are real deep lessons and i'll catch the top of it and then you dig down in it notice it is something that you possess ah not imagination you really have it it's just as real to you as any other thing that could be it's just as real as as you know that that you're right in your automobile it's just as real as you know that you're sitting in the church it's just as real as you hear my boy it is a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of god in that only amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god that puts it back so where your faith in is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in our organization it's not in a group of people it's in god because god is the word amen your faith is in god faith cometh by hearing the word of god then when god by his word not what somebody else did somebody else did but by what god's word said he said let every man's worth be alive and mine be true now you see somebody else do something by a word act of god or promise of god and many of them say i can do that too it's an imagination and when they do you find them rigged up out there somewhere yes it's got to be a substance now that is potentially a faith that is something that would bring you to a faith it's potentially like if you ask me for an oak tree and i'll give you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree but it hasn't produced itself yet but when it really brings itself out it is an oak tree and when you imagine that god does this but when it's revealed to you it's a faith stand a perfect faith that cannot fail that's the reason those visions are so so tremendous to me because it's been proved right every time see and i know that he promised that and he promised in his word and here he comes and promises for this day therefore you know where you're standing when he says so that gives me a faith because he never does nothing contrary to his written word see and if it was contrary to the word i couldn't have faith in it brings it right back again to the word see faith in hearing the word of god you must share the word god's word is that all sufficient word that's all you have need of is this word now faith being deception and in there we find out in hebrews what faith was and what those did you have faith see there's many times that people have faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it the next day there's something and something else but when god wants anchors and you see it there's nothing ever going to make you move from it you're just poking reaching pursuing and pursuing this adventure without authority you're just trying this and trying this and go to this and run here and run there you haven't got the faith yet but when that is what we call thing excuse me i want you to thank you i want you to get this now we the church has got to lift itself in the power of god how we're too close to the end now and i believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make-believe out and get into something real see it's got to be something that you know if you say uh uh brother branham uh that isn't a lie yet i know it's a lot how do you know it's like i'm looking at it or how you know what you could be wrong my side has always declared to me that that was life and that's the reason i believe those visions because it's always declared to me the truth because it comes from the word amen then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it just past the law see because it's beyond the human thinking it's up into the realms of the large things but you're standing here just as the vine just as the french producing the fruit that's in the vine see god uses man and man only god doesn't use machinery god doesn't use groups to man god doesn't use organization god uses individuals always now faith is the substance and fight we understand all those things to done it's not a it's not a imagination it is a substance especially perfect faith that's what i'm talking on tonight getting to perfect faith it is not an imagination now other judge people can say well i got all faith or i sure have or you stand here for it you see see your your very actions prove that you haven't got what you're talking about see if you have faith then where you standing for airlines what do you do these things see if you had perfect faith you'd look right straight to god and believe it and walk away and you would you would have no need of coming into a prayer you'd have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so what would be the use for me saying i got to put a shirt on i got a shirt on how do you know you got a shirt well i see it feel it and i know it's there well that's just how real that when perfect faith takes the hope you don't need no more already done you know it hallelujah how do you do it faith healthy soul hey man that's it see do you get it down one of these that's perfect faith not otherwise i'm venturing out well i'll go the bible say call the elders let them know they want to pray over i know i'll go and you say well i'm going to be healed you're making yourself if don't watch how you're going to make yourself just it's worked out then when he passed you you say oh i still don't feel i see there he was you didn't have faith your genuine faith will do it right there your genuine faith will make it so surreal to you that look at that little woman with a blood issue she said if i can only touch the border of his garment i'll be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issues stopped and she actually believed it and when she touched it the through there stopped it stopped jesus turned and said who touched me that's perfect faith and that same perfect faith tonight will touch jesus christ just as it did then a woman come with a perfect face for that time now now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they had christ walking with him but then altered christ was in that amen and so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the holy spirit it has to bring it it does now you say the disciples didn't have perfect faith no or they had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out and they couldn't do it and the father seen jesus coming and he said we have brought my son to your disciples and they could not cure him and afterwards the disciples asked jesus saying why could not we cure him and jesus says because of the lack of faith and of your unbelief that's right because of your unbelief that's i remember they had this house jesus had given them power the healer was sick to raise the dead and cast out devils just a few days before that yeah they had the power but not the faith to use the power now there's the brand tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power amen but you haven't got that faith to prove it amen amen see what it means amen it takes faith to move it here i got a shell that i hand loaded i know what it'll do by ballistics like the word but i've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the power the powder's got the power of us got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing that powers in the shell but it needs base to charge it and throw it out that's what it takes perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now since he's come upon us ever faith to ignite to see great things issues the faith something that presents it to you for the heart full of joy you walk into the stick room knowing exactly what you're going to say walk in there and know what's going to happen something's already been revealed and you know it when you walk in in the name of jesus christ rise up from there pay up the law there you are that's perfect faith if there's these 10 million people standing it wouldn't happen you know what's going to happen anyhow because you know it it's going to happen regardless what anybody else says you're the ones got the faith could you imagine joshua he called the elders of israel together and said uh brethren we are the servants of the lord i would like for you to say uh ask the lord if it'd be all right if uh if he give us a little more sunlight see and hold his son a little while no he has need of it and without prayer without anything he had need of it and he just commanded the son he said stand there amen i have need and i'll be in the service of the yeah but he sent me over here to do this job and i'm doing the best i don't know how and the enemy is routed and they're out in here if i let the sun go down they'll get together and cause me more trouble so stand still now if the world's turning it holds it up and the sun stays in the place and it don't run what happened then that's right now you make yourself a infidel if you say this and then if you don't you shouldn't full of science because they said the world stop and drop so now if you say god's word is not right then you're in for them but it happened that's the main game i don't know the mechanics of it but it happened i don't know the mechanics of the holy ghost but i know it fell on me i can't tell the mechanics of it but i know the blessings of it that's that's all i don't know about is the blessing of the holy ghost and mechanics keyword seminars is secret this lord cannot be healed because the disciples had power jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness to cast out devils to cleanse the efforts and to raise the dead he gave them power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them i give you power heaven amen i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them amen you know what i mean but jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen amen he said oh bring him here how long will he suffer he had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and it was in him in that giving faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and you know the scriptures tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what god had made him amen and if he did that then can't we rely on what god made us as believers these signs shall follow in that belief [Music] he had faith and what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in god the bible says over here you know if our uh if our hearts condemn us then we can have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards god if you want to read that found saint john 3 21. i got the scripture written down there my moment then i mean first john 3 21 uh notice if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards god but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards god right so you see you can you automatically know that you're wrong you're already not gonna touch yourself like you're a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a believer and there's nothing between you and god you can ask what you will and know that it will be given because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are and have faith in what the word says you want and jesus had faith in the word of god that said what he was it is written of me didn't david and the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him i am the bread of life that come from god out of heaven amen i am the tree of life from the garden of eden i am all these things i am what i am and he knew that a perfect faith that he was the anointed messiah that the spirit of god was upon him he said i myself do nothing but it's my faith in god and god presenting the word may manifest and when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest or you are a believer see and a believer is the faith of god that moves in you you like that i like when you all right before the how to what faith really is knowing who he was without a shadow out he knew he was the son of god he knew it for the word identified the word of god identified who he was he said if i do not have to worship my father then don't believe me but if if i don't do them works don't believe me but if i do then believe the worst for they are the manifested word promise or if you just wake up to you see the word itself identified who you are and he said who can condemn me and stand in other words who can show me that my life and my works don't fulfill exactly what messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was then he had faith to believe that whatever he said it would happen then he turned around and said the works that i do shall you also a little while the world says no more yet you shall because i'll be with you even in you take those thought what you shall say for it's not you to speak it's that father that dwelleth in you he's one doesn't speak and it's not me it's the father that dwelleth in me he jewett the word see what i mean now the identification of a scripture christian these words said jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer and deny any of this woman right amen you can't do it you're not a believer therefore signs can't fall because you just accept what you want to believe and let the rest of it you want don't believe it but you've got to take the whole thing and believe it amen and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs follow them they believe oh could you compare christians today with them christians of long ago how their disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the holy ghost to go just a prisoner as i preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and will of god he couldn't even move until god moved him would you like to see a church rise like that it's going to praise god identifies himself what he was and the same word identifies us if a man loves me he keeps my commandments and if he says he loves me keeps not my commandment that's all of me he's alive truth's not even anything you say well i don't believe well then that you're just not a believer that's all if the bible said so that makes it right amen what the bible says is the truth notice or he said to us if he abides me in my word you think john 15. if you abide me see and faith in him give by me and my word abides in you then you ask what you will now see he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when he knows what he was now if he abides me and my word in you then you know who you are yeah amen that's what you will it'll be given to you wouldn't that be a wonderful night if everybody come that prayer line and say i am a christian i have no condemnation i i know that my heart can then or not something tells me that the night's the end of my suffering and uh no matter how much you come in emotion how much you do it won't work until that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you as the substance when it's there then nothing's gonna shake you from it if if you had cancer and the doctor told you yesterday that you'd be dead before monday morning all your heart your respiration is gone the cancers eat you up your bloodstream become completely cancer whatever it is and something come with this substance that this genuine faith perfect faith was made of substance in you you're laughing at doctor's face you'd be like all eyes you when he walked up and down before that idol and said won't you call a little louder maybe it's pursuing he knew what he was going to do because god had told him what was going to happen he said that's the god that answers the fire be god they said we'll take that proposition and they poured water upon their altars and they they cut themselves they've done everything and called old bail bail answered elijah's just as calm as he could be he said call aloud that said maybe he's pursuing maybe maybe he's on a fishing trip maybe he's good at something else he's out somewhere it's just made fun of him because he knew it's going to happen amen oh watch when he caught everything in order walked out there and said lord god of abraham isaac and his israel never called him his name jacob scheister he called him israel prince with god lord god of abraham isaac and of that prince jacob let me know in the days that i'm your servant and i've done this not at my desire not at my makeup but at your command i have did this your will you told me what to do you showed me these things to be here now i've poured the water up on the altar i've done all these things according to your command don't let me know and when he said that fire fell from the heavens he was just as confident he's gonna fall because he had the substance why the word said so now this same bible is the same god's word amen and when you can receive the substance that's perfect faith substance that this promise that god made is yours how do you feel brother plan when you stand there and you see people coming in different languages and things are you afraid no sir no sir he said i've never been afraid yet because he told me and i believe that it's true amen man if he told me tonight to go to the presidential graveyard and raise up george washington tomorrow morning i'll invite the whole world come see it done all right i'll take whatever kit get out of critic you care to spend them around you're going to see the glory of god is that a chair over here will you sit down and wrestle he'll be here just in a moment students got caught that night another little boy in finland that day brother laying there dead been laying there for a half hour mashed up blood running out of eyes nose and ears his little legs broke up in his little stopping his feet out through the enemy stockings his shoe's gone ah little i thought that ought to be that boy i said hey let's look in the back of that bible brother more we got brother lindsay but more look back there and it shall come to pass saith the lord oh my there will be a land worth a lot of evergreen growing rocks will be laughed together a little boy with a croc hair cut little panty waist buttons up here and his feet your stock is pulled up high you'll have brown eyes they'll be turned back you'll be killed in an automobile accident but you lay your hands up on him and you'll come back to life there was right on there daily [Music] just waiting to work i said this boy is alive in a couple of minutes now that i'm a false prophet running out of finland but if he is on your faces and repent amen i said death you can't hold him i call him for his spirit according to the word of god in the name of jesus christ god says so there it is now that's that's god speaking in this day through vision but this if that vision was contrary to this that would be wrong this is more than division if any vision is contrary to the word leave it alone of god god don't contradict his own word so if this word told you something and you can have the same confidence that's what's going to happen there's nothing if it says they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover a brother if faith that perfect faith got a hold of that you when you passed by this prayer line you'd be jumping and shouting when you're left here it's over and it's over it's all over it's finished if you had a request in your heart and believe that when that prayer was made for that it was going to be answered there is nothing you it's because that's what's going to happen like the woman was a blood issue jesus had perfect faith he had it and he come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word and he abides in my words in you my words which this word abides in you then asks what you will and it'll be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you've said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you asked for and you shall have it it'll be given to you time space nothing else will ever change if you know it's done it's already it's already over there now what now and he said to us if you invited me in my word and you say john here you can ask what you will they'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer see you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position yes is not it written that christ shall come and what all christ would do he said to theo be senate that morning isn't it written in the scriptures that they'll have to that he must suffer and then be killed and raised the third day said why are you so slow of understanding they thought my this man speaks a little differently mother man come to find out when they got into the end it was him eyes was withholding from him see they know that he kept laying to that scripture and they know it was him now you must believe what you asked for if you are a believer recognize yourself as a believer recognize that these things are for you if there's condensation in your life straighten that first amendment amen see if you've got condemnation you're uh or you might have oral robertson and a dozen more people who have faith to come here and pray over you and jump up and down and pull on you by the gallons it you know it won't move it's not trying what falls off from oro's meetings today i catch them in the prayer line you hear it say you was pretty far before a man with dark hair kind of big fella big jaws or roberts and that was at a certain city called certain certainty yes that's right see he was prayed for by such and such a man do you like it but here here's your trouble go make that thing right go out there and confess that sin to your husband to your wife don't do this thing it'll never do you any good no matter who you pray for so you make that right condemnations in your hearts god will not come into that heart condemn god don't dwell in that you've got to make it right then when you do you must have faith if everything's right you must have faith and believe it don't be afraid in the book of job it said here job feared and what he feared it actually happened right amen what brought it his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from us but his fear brought him brother to him he was scared to go to heaven and it did happen now if he knows it wouldn't happen it wouldn't happen see what it means if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe i just haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry but if you know what's going to happen it'll happen it's a substance or something job had a fear that these things have come up on it and they did if you have a fear that your disease is going to leave you or won't lead it it won't if you have a faith that it will you ask any medical doctor the first thing he'll try to get you to do is have confidence and the medicine he's given you if you haven't got no confidence in it you better leave it alone right sure what is it that it's faith that does the healing hey man his faith all the time peter he was doing all right so he got scared the word told him he could walk on the water he's scared first his daughter was a ghost and he said lord if it did you bit me comfy on the water he said come on no that's just the same as james 5 14. then in march 16th the same god said it said come on and so you started walking you got all right got down and out of the ship started walking off there's a storm on scene you know great white cap waves figures these hills around here a foam breaking on top of them terrific maybe 15 20 feet home white caps breaking that was a terrific thing for him to ask if it be you lord see it look like they look like a shadow or spirit he said if it's you fit me come to me on the water jesus said come on and he stepped down said it's the lord i just want but when he got his eyes on the wave he got scared what time in his mind first thing he i'm going to walk because the word said for me the woman and the next thing he looked at is um well he looked at his symptoms he looked out there and seen how big that wave was and he got scared and when he did and he went see what he feared happened what he believed happened when he believed he could walk you off when he believed got scared in his belief then his substance left him see he still professed his face but he didn't have the substance right on the top of that white captain what do i don't show you if he had this perfect face anybody didn't have it he thought he did he did it first he's willing to venture right out why the lord told me to do it it's got to happen so he just stepped right down the board they saw him yeah man he never thought about the the the ways how contrary there was he never got that in his mind and when you get to thinking well now wait you know i've been sick so long i got stopped you just might not go back to the boat but when you quit thinking about that abraham considered is not his own body now dead neither the dead is the stairs move he didn't think about that didn't consider it it wasn't even brought into understanding he didn't even consider it all he just considered what god said and he went on as long as peter did that he walked but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which you are if we live in a perfect faith of a christian or what we are we'll be a mystic to the world yeah the people wouldn't understand you just walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbids you not do then the people get to say there'll be a mystic person to them that's the way it is all believers there are mystics that people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they say this and they say well you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see there wasn't in the world that he lived in they couldn't understand it nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith on his substance base he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapture condition now that means for each one of us amen not just the pastors yeah zeke is trustees that means for the laity every every individual walks in a world god alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you packing out whatever he says is not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are mystic to others we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from now to resist just just simply turning down and just resisting that is just walk away from it god said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him yeah your ears are death and anything else but what the spirits say see he that has an ear that listens see what the spirit says and through the churches the one that's got the listening pose that catches what the spirit says to the churches see what satan says well now this can't that don't have nothing well if you teach that the denomination that's going to have nothing to do with it it goes right on just a thing he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches you know when the bible is always constantly that the him that has faith that he that has an ear to hear let him hear he that has wisdom they count the numbers of the beast all these different things he that has let him tell it to the rest of them that they might have and that's about faith we're talking about now faith that you've got to have that perfect faith that faith that says yes there's nothing to say no when god says yes he says yes yes yes nothing else can ever take it from me with his perfect faith he was very strange and the devil didn't stay around him very long we got it lesson this morning when he come with that great big a fluffle of intellectual conception he fluffled up against jesus saying when he economy found out he hit a ten thousand vote line and brought him right back again yes sir he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone you gotta shock them become a little softer the next time one said are you a great man you yourself up here to be somebody to get behind me amen oh my all you meant i shall not tempt the lord thy god see he proved himself unto satan that he was the lord god amen or it is written thou shall not hint now if satan didn't know that that was the lord god he said wait a minute you're not that person but he knows better than to the benefit of jesus do you know what ground to stand on he says thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and that's who he was amen and satan knows better than to say that because jesus works had already proved that he was the lord thy god notice now another perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstance no matter what it is it masters it now just watch when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances that don't have one thing to do with it it masters that circumstance if it's in a a room of sickness and a large reveal that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and belong uh does that just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going it masters all circumstances amen well if you do this uh sword sword sort of that see it already got it mastered faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how to do it but to do it anyhow it masters all circumstances and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love yes faith and love works together you're just like a young couple you take a young man young woman and they fall in love with one another and as they go along and begin to know one another more their heart just being defeated is one see they're yes they're not husband and wife but their love binds them together and they have confidence in one another now if they really love one another really love and you know that this girl loves you and and she knows that you love her you've got confidence faith in one another right you got faith in one if you didn't you better not marry me notice you gotta have faith and you separate them about one extreme south one extreme north they steal that love beachbody no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another and if you love the law it's not trying to dodge hell but you love the law then you have faith in god and if you love him like a a young girl just happened here in louisville not long ago a woman she was uh she's been a christian for many years but her husband had just fell in love she fell over this man he had been a christian a couple of years and so they got married they loved had confidence in one another and they got married and so the woman said to the man says hubby it must be hard on you you're just a young christian you've had so much to go through with drinking what what that you've had so much to go through with and said i know you're about to be tempted awfully hard and said i want you to know one thing now now if you happen to fall if you happen to to fall into temptation and as overcome don't stay away from home you come on back you come right here because i'm gonna be right here waiting for you and i'm gonna help you praise you again until you get victory i'm going to stay with you because when i married you i married you because i loved you no matter what you are i still love you two days after that he was eating his lunch with the fellas down the border room he was telling them about so now how could a man ever do anything wrong when somebody told you like that there you are how could you trespass that confidence and when we were sinners alienated without god in the world and that muck of mothers have talked about this morning god come to us am i god sought you you never sought god no man can come to me except the father draws you first and god came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out about to create a perfect love look what you are and look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised today real genuine love will create a confidence in his word he caught me when i was nothing i was still nothing but i'm in his hands he called me and he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when he was unlovable right but he changed you yeah it's like the colored sister said that time in her testimony she said i'm not what i ought to be and i'm not what i want to be then i'm not what i used to be she knows she'd come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if god when i was an alien from him so wealthy till he stood down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he sees something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people don't save today look at the million secret tucked besides you but it's up to you amen to take your place amen you're in god's economy no one can do it that's his love to you that won't your love reach right back to him and there's a love path no matter what the situation is it's circumstances it's governed by this love and creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings to faith all right then it can't it can't keep from uh bringing out just exactly what god promised it would do now watch perfect faith is pure just as pure as love is see now when you love somebody and you got you love your husband or you love your wife now there's no need of anybody telling you you don't do it because you do do it and you know you do it now if i ask you how can you you prove you do it well i've proven by the way i live to him see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal honest husband and that proves to me that i and i love my wife or i love my husband see that your life proves what you are the same thing christianity does amen see your faith you have confidence in one another is pure and it's something real that you can't show it to somebody else yet you got it and your actions prove it and when you got pure unadulterated faith like your love is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more you know it's done you just walk along no matter what the thing looks like what anybody else says you know what's happening you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband as well as you know you love see love and faith has to go together their kin folks they love love produces faith when satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word like jesus did the word of god is perfect we'll have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist fate i will hurry just as quick as we can by his faith is what in his word we conquer we can conquer anything both death hell and the great we know that god is god that perfect faith in god's perfect word he conquered everything that he come in contact with death cannot even stand in his presence sickness cannot stand in his presence flowing from him is like rivers of virtue going out constantly virtue going from his garments these people laying in his shadow step put their finger on his garments with him when that woman down there then everybody wanted to touch his garment because they seen that there was virtue going from the conflict though like river there he was walking walking in a world with perfect faith because he was the word and now if he abides me through him he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of way virtues flowing from the rivers of god's fountains of blessings just going on to the people see what i mean and you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it it's actually taking place and you see it if you just imagine that don't do any good but if it's really there it really happened now notice see by when he stood and he said if you destroy this body this temple i'll raise it up again in three days why he was just as satisfying to do that because the scripture says that he won't do it the messiah i'll not leave his soul in hell neither suffer my holy one is decoration a prophet when the word comes to has said that would happen and he know he was that person and when the jesus himself said the prayer of faith shall save the sick or they shall lay hands over sick and they shall recover if you must have the same perfect confidence that my hands are they know me i shall recover ever because he said so he said you destroy this body and i'll raise it up because he know he was a messiah i'll not suffer my holy one's decoruption he knew he was the only one neither i'll leave his soul in hell he hit me he know he'd do it he had confidence that he was out of conquerable death in hell said destroy it if you wish to i'll raise it back again in three days oh my i have power to lay my life down or i have power to take it up again he knows who he was you're a christian you have rights to any redemptive blessing that jesus died for you it's all yours it's already paid for you just have to believe it not imagine it but believe it and know that it's yours and you can be accepted all a conquering faith no uh do you do it would happen before he could predict that it would happen because he knowed it would happen and whatever he predicted come to pass now watch whatever he said god honored what he said think of that whatever jesus said god brought it to pass so you know his words were god's word now look that same scripture comes right back into us again if he stayed to this mountain oh my god i i just let that focus he knew that he pleased god he knew that there was nothing on his life god had already testified this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased you're him this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in the day of his baptism i'm pleased to make my abode in here there's no condemnation to him at all now when the same god comes to you as pleased to dwell in you please to honor your word what your decision is what was joshua's decision stand still son and he stood there amen amen sure what was moses decision how did he stick over the river like that and call for to open and open see whatever you ask and if you stay to this mountain be moving don't doubt see in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you say that puts you back in the word now that's not skim milk it puts you back i don't go jump shot over top of you because you can't anchor but real january's face catches that right now i've seen it friends there's this bible laying open before me i've seen it happen and i know it's the truth i know god in heaven knows that i might not live through to finish this message but i know that it happened i've seen it myself i'm a witness of that word being fulfilled and i know it is the truth amen stand and stand there and see the creator bring a living creature into existence right in presence of your eyes and shake your head in one and then look around and see him bring another one just exactly like it because you said so and turn over here and say there will be another one there and look and there it is [Music] no vision just speak the word never saw the squirrels he just said the scripture what it was and speak it and don't doubt it but what you say it'll be there and uh took god at his word and it was bad am i right that's just as powerful as friends as your pastor that's just as powerful as it was when joshua stopped the sun amen because the sun was already there the elements was moving and he stopped the movement but then he brought something there that wasn't there amen he created amen until god should be acquainted with the god that could take the steps of the earth [Music] to life again and after i've been planted in the grave oh my there it is my faith looks up to thee thou lamb of calvary amen if you say and don't doubt but believe that what you said you shall have what you say believed as it happened david in the psalm spoke of him and with it he took his power and he ministered to others not only did he keep it to himself but he ministered to others by also saved others even to the uttermost and he can do the same thing now and promise the same faith to the believers in his word in john john 14 12. he said so mark 16 and also in mark 11 23 we just read now what now he has appeared to us in the same form that he did to them in the old testament and in the same as it is in the new testament and assured by the same word the same christ and i declare to you that christ is the holy ghost the word christ means the anointed one just the person that's anointed that is the christ the anointed one how many knows that's true that's good the anointing one there would be a man that would be anointed anointed with what the bible said in acts 2 that jesus of nazareth a man approved of god anointed with the holy ghost went about us and done great works and things that god manifested through that he was in this man and now we become anointed with that same spirit anointing messiah messiahs of the last days to shine forth the resurrection of jesus christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the holy ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one already the same sign promised by the same god in the same word is making this same manifestation there's nothing left for us to do but please i believe and that creates a perfect faith amen just think how how numb we are just think of that just a minute now let's see has he done all things well has he ever told us anything about what happened just exactly the way he said hasn't he performed and has a great feeling of fire been among us and done just exactly like he promised to do heaven we still have besides things it has been predicted what would happen go right there and have it even in the papers and magazines pack it right back and show it once told you months before it happened has it done just exactly the way he did in the old testament in the new testament exactly the same one amen the same holy spirit comes as discerner and the word of god which is quicker and sharper than a true a story a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart isn't that right is that the same god now that's same wrong it's not a stranger or somewhere else he's here he sure does this to create a perfect faith our feeling is right now i know that his spirit is here i know that he knows all things amen and i know he forced to do something he's been doing something to create this perspective in the people yeah are we going to walk into eternity like it was in the days of noah are they so safe are we going to come like lot but free out of sodom while we go to comrades in the days of john the baptist with six believers let us believe now for his worst is perfect that are manifested daily and perfectly before us showing that he is the word the word hebrews the fourth chapter says the word of god is sharper than any two aged source of uh uh even a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart think of that the word of god is that a desire of the intent of the heart for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-day sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and our spirit and other joints and of the mind and is a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart the a word operating in human flesh by physical science by material science by scriptural science practically bring to you a perfect face for a perfect rapture why can't we look at it not a mystic the devil has plenty of things in the world before you try to make it keep you from believing bible says rise and shake yourself pinch yourself his spirit is he knows you you've got one thing to do and that's to believe it to accept it and you know you believe that yeah he knows what's in you he knows what you are he knows what you're desiring he knows what you have need of jim praise the lord amen he goes directly into our prayer line amen amen of course he knowing what he had to do but yet he took so long to preach this and say and so he went right on after he he said he knows what you have need of and then he spoke to somebody in the audience he said jim do you believe he knows about that baby amen that was that jim had there amen and then he went on to pray for the others and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart but but again it's a perfect faith amen it's a perfect faith and what is a perfect faith perfect faith believes god amen prairie faith follows the leadership of god is not getting this revelation that revelation in you did you wonder about this and wonder about that no no you just i pray grace god give us that kind of a faith amen by the grace of god said well god says what god reveals to us we're going to do it we'll go on we're living for god amen we're going to give the glory to god give the glory to jesus amen not be ashamed of it that's what faith is all about amen but but you're saved by grace through faith that's right it's not not grace only but grace through faith and what is faith well faith is god revealing to you is word is will in the word amen and it's faith is also a revelation that is not me that lives as christ that liveth in me that's tremendous oh my what yeah christ lives in me and you you got yourself turned over to him to his leadership you're spiritual you've got a spiritual anointing a spiritual life in your heart and in your soul by the grace of god but of course there's not many with that in these last days not by any means because the bible tells us again when he comes will he find such faith will he find people with faith you know not intellectual faith but spiritual holy ghost it's it's you and god in you you and christ in you in your heart oh praise the lord you walk in the spirit you live in the spirit you walk by faith you live by faith you're totally under his control and whatever he says you're going to do when and how and where and so on lord not my will thine be done see as i said the the the situation and and when the bridegroom came to the end of his ministry that look what was the end of his ministry surrender he surrendered amen he surrendered all and he pray you know knowing what was going to happen and knowing what god what what we thus saith the lord this has got to happen that's got to happen and just think and again there's a painting yes right here of christ in the garden and i know there's i noticed something there just uh this past week i think that i have not never noticed about that picture before and uh it was what it was was jesus we all look at jesus we see jesus and he's praying but then i drew near another copy of that picture somewhere and and oh i said who's that and there's there's three or four or five behind jesus and into into the dark cloud there and it's the disciples sleeping oh yes the disciples sleeping amen so brother and sister but jesus was he wasn't sleeping in a sense he was having a nightmare you know because he was facing what he knew that he had come to the earth to to do and that was to lay down his life and he had he's going to be beaten with many stripes and and he had to shed his blood and like i said there's a lot of paintings concerning the the crucifixion and there are very few paintings that ever show you you know the the amount of blood that jesus shed ever exactly and again that's like when the soldiers went and they and they broke the legs of the other of the other two thieves or that were on their their crosses and he broke their legs and why so as to so that they would drop down and and they would lose their breath and wouldn't be able to breathe and they'd die but when they got to jesus jesus was already dead death was already taken over he says he's dead so they knew they didn't have to break his legs so a man didn't have to do that at all but what they did was with the spear they drove it into his side and out came his blood amen brother hallelujah he had already shed blood when he was beaten with many stripes he was he he was he shed a lot of blood but then on the cross and they and they put that spear in his side and the blood all came out came out came out and uh went down and the power of god said where did that blood go he said we're down to the earth he said because he redeemed us and the earth because there's a new a new heaven and a new earth a man that that we're heading to but when he was coming to that place in that position he come on he was really desperate oh yeah really desperate knowing that what he was going to suffer in flesh and not only not just the suffering in the flesh on the cross but what was going to happen after he was going to meet the devil oh yeah and he knew the devil yes the devil was back there and he was he walked up and down in in in the trails and so on oh yeah he was he was an angel up there with the father with christ and jesus knew that now when he died and laid down his life for us shed all of his blood amen when he when he come forth in another in the other dimension he went down to set the old testament saints free amen to let them out of the prison by the grace of god but he had to deal with the devil he had to fight with the devil there amen so but again he conquered death l and the grave and he's given us power over the world the flesh the devil amen by the grace of god so brother are we coming to that place that he came to oh yeah i believe the bride is going to come to that and your prayer why it's going to be so desperate when you realize the the the the day we're living the hour we're living and then the conditions that we're dealing with the unbelief oh yeah knowing what why why are we seeing all these things around the world because the devil has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short amen so brother sister the devil knows that so what do we know what what is the faith that we have what is revealed to us oh yeah well god sent the prophet amen to forerun the lord the coming of the lord amen but he come down to be united with his bridegroom to take to his bride rather to take her into glory in the rapture amen but i'll tell you this we have a lot of unbelief to deal with yeah jesus had a lot of unbelief to deal with even in his disciples we have a lot of unbelief to deal with either around many believers but brother could that many of us have the faith that the prophet was speaking up and these have given our turn our lives over to the will of god lord i know we're living in this hour you have proved it i believe it and i'm gonna go do what you want me to do amen not my will thine be done amen by the grace of god so brother perfect faith will bring the bride to that place perfect faith brought jesus to that place praying faith is bringing us to that place and what is the faith it is a revelation of what god is doing amen so god gave us that perfect faith a revelation of what he done good but now it's a revelation of what he's doing he did that to open the word and brother the results of the word is in you and in me we believe it amen praise the lord and brother he's pointing us to the resurrection pointing us to the rapture look up amen it is the hour of our redemption of our bodies got to believe it we're not religious not religiously like most people became in the lutherans and methods and all the other churches the pentecostals and they just became religious oh we're pentecostals we believe in the holy ghost we believe in the gifts and so on and they just go on and it became it became a doctrine one time it was an experience every day every day they're living the experience amen of that faith but then they went from a spiritual faith to an intellectual faith amen just knowledge in their heads and the message is becoming that way today to a lot of believers oh yeah god did this god did that and now we're we're just getting into the word and waiting for him to we that he waiting for him to do this waiting for him to do that he's waiting for you to do it yeah according to your faith not not not for god to do it well if well yeah god's going to do it but he's going to do it in you he's going to do it in me amen as he was doing it in jesus through that flesh part amen so brother are you getting close to the resurrection are you getting close to the rapture are you getting more and more convicted in your heart and in your soul oh lord i know you're waiting on me and i know you're you're you're the saints that are going on are waiting on me so lord please don't let me don't let me delay i want to move on into the resurrection i want to move on into the rapture lord i pray i'm not going to come under the influence of that that lack of faith spirit where it says that will he find that faith when he comes amen because he's going to need he's going to need that kind of faith what is it there's a belief in the whole body of revealed truth amen so will he find that in you and in me because if we believe in the whole body of revealed truth we're going to oh yeah no problem we'll we'll bring the resurrection we'll bring the rapture praise the lord as jesus did praise the lord and yeah he brought did he bring a resurrection yeah he did bring a rapture he did because the old testament saints came up with him when he rose from the dead they rose from the dead and the bible says the old testament saints they went into the city and appeared unto many but on that day when jesus was there with the angels and in the cloud that he went up they went up because it's right there in the book of psalms open up the doors open up the gates and so on they said who is the king of glory he's the lord of lord lord of lords amen mighty in battle he won the victory they said open up and let us in amen they opened up and jesus went in with the old testament saints but now it's new testament by the grace of god amen amen amen but please don't take it for granted because i i know that god is challenging us amen with what he says will i find faith when i come is he finding the faith in you is he finding faith in me so that we live by faith not by sight amen brother again the scriptures have warned us and we're dealing with this as well yeah why why why does the world come to that place of like lacking faith amen this is why i'll read it for you again take it serious concerning perfect faith and let's make our calling and election sure how do we do that make sure you got perfect faith amen by the grace of god and again let me highlight the the issue to you and like i've said before and i i did explain that to a church that i ministered to in in ontario one time a number of years ago amen and uh they were they were impressed by it they they thought that oh amazing yeah and i said it's like reading your bible like reading the message and i said if you notice my books i said there there's there's some there underlined i said with a pen i said when i first read the book that's what i did i said then i went through and then i highlighted it maybe in orange not orange but with a different color here oh yeah might have been green i highlighted something green oh yeah that struck me and then i read it again and i highlighted something yellow and i said maybe the last time i read it i led it in orange so i said every time you read a message you might something might strike you that didn't strike you when you read it first time oh yeah not only this message of course any message has the same thing with the bible that i would go through the bible and i know some people don't do it but and i usually have the excuse me i can find it there for you oh yeah a ruler and that ruler is in my bible i keep it in my bible so that when i read the bible again maybe there's something going to strike me that didn't strike me before and i'm going to i'll underline that yeah so i use the ruler to underline it by the grace of god amen and sometimes i re i use the blue pen sometimes i use a red one and so on by the grace of god why because this just strikes me now whereas it didn't strike me before amen because it wasn't ordained to strike me before and brother concerning what god has done i believe brother is ordained to strike us not the generation that the prophet preached to in 1963 or 65 no no but it's to this generation as i said that our brother jonathan highlighted where the prophet of god has been gone for 55 years yeah and and i've been praying to the lord how much longer i said will it be before the rapture because the prophet of god did say that you young preachers are ordained to take this message on to the coming of the lord amen the resurrection the rapture he said you you young ministers he said you've got to fill our shoes he was referring to issues and brother neville and brother you know brother neville was that the brother we hear responding yeah yeah brother brother neville the pastor of tabernacle oh yeah and when our brother neville was was was going on to be with the lord uh there was a brother that went to visit him and he said brother neville he said do you have anything to tell us he said that i want that you would like me to share he said with with the believers and he said yes and then he said brother said what what is it brother and he said listen go tell them he said that what they're looking for is already here he says not coming it's here amen and get them to look up amen and then the lord took our brother home amen so i pray the grace of god that now brother what the problem of god was preaching in perfect faith works his faith expressed and the rapture amen by the grace of god that brother that we've worked we've got the faith by the grace of god amen and the faith that it was ordained to to give to us in these last last days if there's anything that that god wants us to have right now and we need to have right now is resurrection rapturing faith yeah now faith god do this god do that brother that's trying to get god to concentrate on what we want in our in our physical lives brother according to the word we got to get the anointing so we want to concentrate on what god wants amen what god wants to do it's not me not not you not in our natural lives in our everyday living lord we're we'll be glad to get out of here and lord we thank you for the messages and the messenger you sent to give us the faith to get out amen to take us out of here and into eternity god help us brother that we believe as we ought to believe from our hearts we believe what god wants us to believe from our hearts that we're not going to mist miss the revelation it's like the prophet of god said he said you look for this in a preacher you look for that in a preacher or you all you want the preacher said to do this want a preacher do that preach this preach this and he highlighted it when he said oh yeah you want really what you want he said you want an evangelistic ministry you want the evangelist to come and focus on this and stir you all up with this stir you up with that no he said no that's not it that's true this people look for look for the ministry like like the evangelist and preach like an evangelist and so on no no he said that's not that's not what god wants us for us no no it's a ministry they're going to focus on the word stay with the word let's get into the word amen not your not to get you all wound up physically but let's get us wound up spiritually amen by the grace of god and there are those amen that just regular ministry sometimes doesn't stir them they're not interested but then they can get a certain evangelistic ministry oh yeah they love that because that that preacher can stir me up that preacher is going to do this he's going to do that yeah well maybe he's not he's not doing what god wants us to do amen to get us into resurrection and rapturing faith or we can scream and praise the lord and thank god for what he's done and get all excited because of what he's done but fail to get what he's doing amen because that's going to calm you down by the grace of god amen oh it's in you don't have to turn to it i'll read it before we close it's in second timothy chapter 3 and it says this no also that in the last days perilous times shall come amen and we're experiencing perilous times for men shall be lovers of their own selves you're more caught up with yourself than we are caught up with the body of christ amen they're lovers of their own selves amen and they're covetous they want more and more and more of what we can get in this world and in this life and boasters oh yeah proud blasphemers disobedient to parents yeah the relationship's not there like used to be between parents and children amen and it says unthankful and that is the generation we're experiencing for sure and unholy i'll hold it because do not live in the life of christ it might be religious life but not christ and he says without natural affection having that love is a perfect faith that works by love amen grace of god and at one time that was oh it's so natural uh such a natural thing back then years ago among among the lutherans among the methodists and the old-fashioned salvation army and the old-fashioned pentecostal the law that was there they love one another they fellowship one another that's all they wanted amen and they why was it it was the love of god loving one another love of god in you amen and your love for god amen be amen because god was in your brother god was in your sister amen but now he said they're unthankful unholy without natural affection and truth breakers yeah people there's not no repeat the the generation today that they're not normal they don't like normal don't talk normal don't react normal no it's the influence of the devil that's without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good no wonder he says when he comes when he finds faith yeah perilous times traitors oh yeah heady high-minded yeah lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god didn't say they didn't love god but their love was a pleasure more than lovers of god oh yeah he's talking about professing believers professing christians but he said instead of the spiritual taking control the holy ghost is the devil the world amen and it says having a form of godliness amen the world we're living it a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away yeah avoid those things don't get don't get caught up with those spirits even though they're religious they make sure it's a right spirit and a right attitude right motives right objectives by the grace of god that god's in control that they're again not just religious but you're spiritual amen lots of believers are religious but not many spiritual amen having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof is not what god wants you to do what they want to do god do this god do that he said from such turn away and for of this sword are they which crept into houses and led captive silly women laid with sins he said led away with diverse lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth amen amazing you're learning the message but never ever getting to the knowledge of the truth oh yeah we know they're learning too they're intellectual but what about the message god help us so he said as janice and chambers withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men are corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith concerning the faith that reprobates god help us to focus on the faith that pleases god amen but they shall proceed no further for their follies shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was amen the grace of god be with us amen but paul said again thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions he said i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me praise the lord oh yeah god allowed it god permitted it amen to bring out the faith that would please him and god is allowing a lot of things in our lives and it is to bring up the faith that pleases him and you and me but the faith that's going to take us on to the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of god amen praise the lord god bless us again judge yourself by what you heard lord do i have that perfect faith help me let go and let you have your way in your will in my life amen not my will father thine be done amen just to ask your grace of course to be with and be in prayer for brother earl ellsworth and uh when he returns again he will be here maybe for two or three weeks because he's going to have uh treatment for his cancer every day so we will have to take him to the hospital and for his treatment then bring him back to my home again and he seemed like he would like to stay with us again and he said he enjoys it with us and he feels at home with us so we pray the grace of god to bless him and the grace of god to be with us and to give us the strength we need the wisdom we need so pray grace as our brother goes through these treatments for the cancer that they they say is in his voice box and of course it's it's a difficult situation because uh it's very difficult to talk to our brother and for him to talk to us his brother is his voice is very very very low and so even when he was here before a short time ago that sometimes i would maybe try to keep conversation reduced down so as not to imp impress our brother to talk and talk and talk but i'm sure he doesn't mind doing it you know but again i would try to keep it down because of the stress that he would put on his voice box so that's where apparently the cancer is is in the voice box and we pray the grace of god to bless the treatment amen so and again praying grace that the lord will uh increase our faith and even as the brother goes for treatment then he'll go trusting the lord amen the grace of god be with him and also sister violet his wife and his brother sibling brother did call us and uh and expressed our aries appreciation for for what we're doing and the help that we're giving the family and so on so we pray god of god's grace to his family amen and of course again brother earlsworth i've known him now for well since 65 or 66 1966. that's when i first came to the word and our brother ellsworth was part of the message way back then and it's amazing that the son the son who now lives with him in in carmenville he was just a young boy back then i remember meeting him at brother manuel's parsonage home in bishop falls so i pray the grace of god to their son amen and the conviction of the holy ghost amen praise the lord so the lord be with us and also to remind i trust our brother jonathan that's online that he will be ministering for us on on wednesday i'll ask our brother to minister for us amen and to understand too that our brother is is a ministering brother okay and we've been discussing this situation and concerning uh being recognized maybe by the government as a minister well so if if like we myself and the deacons that came forward and we prayed with for him and with him and also for sister blanc as well so uh that's recognizing the ministry in our brother amen we don't need the we don't need the government's recognition no it's it's the ministry of the church by the grace of god but he does he does need a certain recognition by the government to perform certain things such as a marriage you know he you can't uh administers can't to perform a marriage unless he's recognized by the government and he's got he got the permission from the government to perform marriages and so on so i pray and one time we we had to have that do to dedicate children but we don't have to have it now one time we had to fill out papers and send it to government even for baby dedication but not not anymore and now that the responsibility to announce those things is is given turned over to the doctors and the hospitals that they they gotta send that to the government amen so keep in prayer for our brother jonathan as the lord uses him to to help us and be with us and encourage us amen through his ministry amen god bless you listen praise the lord press on to perfect faith please in the name of jesus let go and let god have his way to give us perfect faith and we'll sing amen we'll sing the song that brother branham said he'll be he'll be under a tree and he's going he's going to sing it in the glory amen and he said you he said if you hear anybody sing an amazing grace you can say oh brother branham made it amen and i say [Music] if you hear anybody shout hallelujah we'll know who made it amen we'll say oh i think brother chad made it oh i don't think he'll be able to hide no by the grace of god so the lord bless our brother amen and trusting that he's going to lead the way for sister leah and the family amen lord bless us let's sing an amazing grace and return to our brother bob and be in prayer for myself and sister betty especially when our brother elsewhere comes back it's going to be a lot of responsibility for sister betty to be looking after him because after treatment he's only allowed to eat certain things so we pray the grace of god to to strengthen us and encourage us and we know that we learn through sister maureen here that that the saints are there to help sister betty with some meals and so on so god bless us amen praise the lord let's sing an amazing grace and brother bob will come how sweet the sound that saved i rage like me i want was lost was blind but now i see to us grace amen grace of god
