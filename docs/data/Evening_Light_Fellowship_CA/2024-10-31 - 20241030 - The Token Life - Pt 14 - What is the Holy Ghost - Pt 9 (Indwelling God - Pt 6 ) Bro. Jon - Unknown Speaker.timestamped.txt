[39:18] to be the word in flesh Lord Lord you're

[39:23] your form Lord and it's a new expression
[39:25] of Christ the word Lord we want want to
[39:27] be that every day Lord God Heavenly
[39:30] Father Lord I pray that each morning
[39:32] when we wake up Lord till the moment
[39:33] that we lay our head down at night and
[39:35] go to sleep Lord that we would recognize
[39:37] the unveiling of God before us Heavenly
[39:39] Father Lord that we could surrender
[39:41] ourselves so completely to you Lord to
[39:44] be used of you Lord that you could do
[39:46] the same works that you could say the
[39:48] same words that you could have the same
[39:50] effect that you did when you walked the
[39:52] shores of galile Galilee 2,000 years ago
[39:55] Lord help us lord it's only through
[39:59] surrender lord it's only through
[40:01] surrender that this can happen but Lord
[40:03] we know you've given us Lord your spirit
[40:05] that we could surrender to it Lord that
[40:07] we could live your very with your very
[40:09] life inside of us Lord bless your people
[40:12] bless the word this evening Lord we pray
[40:14] Lord may it strengthen our faith Lord I
[40:16] ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it
[40:19] amen amen God bless you you can turn if
[40:22] you would to 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[40:24] amen certainly appreciate brother Joe
[40:26] stepping into the
[40:28] into the pulpit here tonight to uh lead
[40:30] songs amen it's never easy to jump out
[40:33] of your usual role but uh amen certainly
[40:36] happy he did it anden a few updates we
[40:39] uh I spoke with brother Kingsley just
[40:40] before service he said there's no change
[40:42] with sister Melody so she's got
[40:43] contractions but nothing's really
[40:45] progressing so just remember her in
[40:48] prayer it's not certainly not uh unusual
[40:50] for a first pregnancy to go past the due
[40:52] date which was a couple days ago I
[40:54] believe 28th so just remember them in
[40:57] prayer it's uh it's always a little bit
[40:59] stressful that's probably putting it
[41:01] mildly amen I also spoke with sister
[41:03] Beverly about her grandson Noah the
[41:05] surgery the procedure went well uh he's
[41:08] still experiencing a fair bit of pain so
[41:10] they said there was a lot of Puss in
[41:12] there as I mentioned and so once that
[41:14] gets out then they're trusting that
[41:15] there'll be a uh a relieving of the pain
[41:18] and whatnot so keep praying for him and
[41:20] for them for the family each one amen
[41:23] and it's good to have brother Paul back
[41:24] with us as well God bless you good to
[41:26] see you again
[41:27] and then I have some some less fortunate
[41:29] news perhaps and brother Dale has
[41:31] notified me that he'll be leaving
[41:33] December 2nd moving back to Edmonton to
[41:35] his loving family so I I I expressed our
[41:39] thanks to him for all the time he spent
[41:41] with us and um certainly he's been a a a
[41:44] model of Christian virtue and character
[41:47] and strength amen and uh we're sad to
[41:50] see him go but um I I'll say myself I
[41:54] wasn't surprised he's a father and and
[41:57] and he has family and I just anticipated
[42:01] at some point he was going to go back
[42:02] but I didn't think it was quite this
[42:03] early brother Dale I thought I we get
[42:05] you for a little bit longer but I just
[42:07] want to say from the pulpit publicly God
[42:09] bless you we love you we appreciate you
[42:10] we're thankful for the fellowship the
[42:13] time the effort you've put in here and
[42:15] uh we were blessed to have you with us
[42:17] amen so uh when you go is if everything
[42:21] goes through and when you go certainly
[42:23] you go with our love and our blessing
[42:25] with you and trusting God will just just
[42:27] uh do even Greater Works in your life
[42:29] and in your family's life as you go back
[42:31] amen God bless you brother Dale amen
[42:33] turn if we would to 2 Corinthians
[42:35] chapter 5 2 Corinthians chapter 5 Paul
[42:38] says here for the love of Christ
[42:39] constraineth us because we thus judge
[42:42] that if one died for all then were all
[42:46] dead in other words if somebody had to
[42:48] die everybody had to be dead already we
[42:52] are dead in sins there was nobody
[42:53] excluded from that he had to die because
[42:55] we were dead in our sins there was no
[42:57] eternal life available to us he says and
[42:59] that he died for all that they which
[43:01] live should not henceforth live unto
[43:03] themselves but unto him which died for
[43:06] them and rose again amen if you've
[43:08] received him and you've accepted the
[43:10] sacrifice of Calvary it ought to change
[43:11] your life he says wherefore henceforth
[43:14] know we no man after the flesh yay
[43:17] though we have known Christ after the
[43:19] flesh yet now henceforth know we him no
[43:22] more amen God bless you you can have
[43:24] your seats this evening and we're
[43:25] continuing our series on the to Bren
[43:27] life on the Holy Ghost and we're going
[43:29] to take one
[43:30] more one more series on this on this
[43:33] subtitle of indwelling God and we've
[43:35] been speaking on this on the godhead
[43:37] really for the last uh four or five
[43:39] Services I guess and I want to kind of
[43:41] wrap that up in a neat picture tonight
[43:42] Lord willing so we can see where these
[43:44] Junctions and time are and how God has
[43:46] changed his form and how God has changed
[43:48] his form kind of at the very end of
[43:50] things and so we follow God kind of as
[43:52] he's gone through time and and we see
[43:55] him at the beginning he's Jehovah God
[43:57] he's he's L he's the self-existing one
[44:00] and this was in Genesis 1 this is John 1
[44:03] in the beginning was the word it's just
[44:05] God by himself in spirit form and we
[44:07] couldn't really see him touch him hear
[44:09] him do any of these things amen
[44:10] necessarily but then we see in Genesis
[44:13] one that he created a body of light amen
[44:16] and that body was the pillar of fire and
[44:18] it was a body for himself to dwell in
[44:20] and so God himself came and he poured
[44:23] his Spirit into that body of light and
[44:26] that was the pillar of fire and it had
[44:28] no name given to it then but we know
[44:30] looking back that it had a name and it
[44:31] was Jesus Christ and we'll see that as
[44:33] we go through the scriptures amen it was
[44:35] God in a body of light a God in a body
[44:38] of fire and we call that Jesus Christ
[44:40] and today people so many are confused
[44:42] when we call Jesus Christ the Christ
[44:45] because they think of that as a
[44:46] description of a
[44:48] man but Christ means anointed one amen
[44:51] it's a body it's a dwelling place for
[44:53] God and that's the problem I think with
[44:55] Christianity Today is they put Jesus
[44:57] Christ as a man 2,000 years ago and they
[45:00] can't see Jesus Christ today and they
[45:02] can't see Jesus Christ before that but
[45:04] he's been there all along and really
[45:06] we'll see as we go through this and I've
[45:07] said it before and certainly we're we're
[45:09] students of the message we ought to know
[45:11] that Jesus Christ is the mystery of God
[45:13] revealed that's the name of God that's
[45:15] the revealing of God and it's been
[45:17] Christ all the way along from start to
[45:20] finish amen so Jesus Christ was in
[45:22] existence way before 2,000 years ago
[45:25] when he walked the shores of Galilee or
[45:26] when was born in a manger when he
[45:28] received when the Holy Ghost stepped
[45:30] into him at the River Jordan and Paul
[45:32] would say this in Ephesians he says and
[45:34] to make all men see what is the
[45:37] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[45:39] beginning of the world had been hid in
[45:41] God who created All Things by Jesus
[45:44] Christ so Paul says Jesus Christ was the
[45:47] beginning of the creation of God it was
[45:50] not 2,000 years ago that was a different
[45:52] beginning of a creation it was God in
[45:54] flesh but yet he says God created all
[45:57] things by Jesus Christ we know that he
[45:59] stepped into a pillar of light a pillar
[46:01] of fire so that entire body with God in
[46:04] it was called Jesus Christ from the very
[46:06] beginning who created all things John
[46:09] 1:1 John 1 tells us that in the
[46:11] beginning was the word and the Word was
[46:12] with God and the Word was God and the
[46:14] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[46:15] in these things and it says all things
[46:17] were created by Him so the word it was
[46:19] Christ was in the existence uh at the
[46:22] very beginning but when that light was
[46:24] first made it was just a a thing
[46:27] the word was just a thing the word was
[46:29] in God's mind and God spoke it and it
[46:32] was still just an object but as soon as
[46:34] God stepped into it and he identified
[46:36] himself in that light in that Pillar of
[46:38] Fire then it went from becoming a what
[46:41] to becoming a who if I can put it that
[46:43] way it went from an object to becoming
[46:45] the person of God Amen because God was
[46:48] dwelling inside of it so now the word is
[46:50] becoming a person it's becoming a life
[46:52] it's becoming a reality so what was the
[46:55] name of that it was the name of that is
[46:57] Jesus Christ Paul tells us that the
[46:59] identification of God the name of God
[47:01] from start to finish has been Jesus
[47:03] Christ amen it wasn't revealed back then
[47:06] they didn't know him as Jesus Christ
[47:08] back in the Old Testament they didn't
[47:09] have a name of God as we've said before
[47:11] the the name of God was revealed in the
[47:13] sound of breathing in and breathing out
[47:15] he was the life he was the light of man
[47:17] but he had no name but Paul says God
[47:19] created all things through that body
[47:22] through Jesus Christ that was the
[47:24] revealing of God so if we see our entire
[47:27] Bible and we can read it we see that
[47:29] it's Christ from start to finish amen
[47:31] for the believer for for for the time
[47:34] bubble that we're in if we want to put
[47:35] it that way God has identified himself
[47:38] from start to finish through Jesus
[47:40] Christ he's changed his form many times
[47:42] he's changed his appearance he's changed
[47:44] the way he talks and all these different
[47:46] things but it's been Christ from start
[47:47] to finish it's not God the father and
[47:49] then God the son and then God the Holy
[47:51] Spirit three persons of a godhead but
[47:54] it's just God revealing himself time and
[47:56] time again in a different form and in a
[47:58] different way but if we look at our
[48:00] opening scripture here this evening Paul
[48:02] says wherefore henceforth know we no man
[48:04] after the flesh yay though we have known
[48:07] Christ after the flesh yet now yet now
[48:10] henceforth know we him no more and the
[48:13] Amplified says so from now on WE regard
[48:15] no one from a human point of view
[48:17] according to worldly value standards and
[48:21] values that means that when you look at
[48:23] me you better not look at me the way
[48:25] that the world would I would be judged
[48:27] this evening based on the expense of my
[48:29] suit on whether I I have nice shoes
[48:32] whether I'm in a certain level of
[48:33] Fitness how I speak we would judge by
[48:35] that Paul says we can't judge anything
[48:37] by that now we don't go by appearance
[48:40] we've got all types and of people in
[48:42] this group and there's all kinds of
[48:43] people around this world that if you
[48:45] were to look at them you would be fooled
[48:47] by the outside Paul says we're not
[48:48] looking at the outside anymore and then
[48:51] he goes on he says though we have known
[48:53] Christ from a human point of view now we
[48:56] no long longer know him in this way he's
[48:58] saying Christ has changed the way that
[49:01] we know him has changed there's two
[49:02] elements to this thought at least as far
[49:04] as we'll go into this evening and one of
[49:06] them is that we no longer look at Christ
[49:08] as a man as perhaps people did while he
[49:11] was on the earth 2,000 years ago amen
[49:13] but the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[49:16] is has changed they knew him then as son
[49:18] of man they may have re they may have
[49:20] called him Son of God and they knew that
[49:22] deity walked in flesh amen and God was
[49:25] hiding himself in flesh so that Pillar
[49:27] of Fire what had happened is the pillar
[49:30] of fire had gone away and now God was
[49:32] hiding himself in flesh but the second
[49:35] element of that is that Christ is no
[49:37] longer identified in a single body as he
[49:40] was before cuz Paul now speaking after
[49:43] the resurrection after the Ascension of
[49:45] Christ after the Holy Ghost has come
[49:46] down on the day of Pentecost he says
[49:49] Christ is no longer the way that you
[49:50] experienced him because many of the
[49:52] people he's talking to had met Jesus
[49:55] Christ Jesus of nazare with the holy
[49:57] spirit inside of him God unveiled in
[49:59] flesh they had met him they had heard
[50:01] him preach they had maybe shook his hand
[50:04] maybe they had touched him maybe they
[50:05] had spent time with him whatever it
[50:07] might be they knew Jesus Christ as a man
[50:09] but Paul says he's changed now he's
[50:12] moved on from that amen so it's not just
[50:15] a single person or body but he's saying
[50:17] Christ has changed his form and we don't
[50:19] know him as a human the way that we used
[50:21] to before and so you can't go today and
[50:24] you can't say here is Jesus there is
[50:27] Jesus remember Jesus said when they say
[50:29] though Christ is here don't believe it
[50:31] or L he's in the secret Chambers or L he
[50:33] says you can't do that because he's not
[50:35] bound by a single body anymore there is
[50:37] no one man that identifies Christ
[50:40] anymore that way there is no longer a
[50:42] fullness of the godhead in a single body
[50:45] amen but God has changed his form in in
[50:48] who Jesus Christ is has changed from
[50:51] what he used to be to what he is today
[50:53] amen so we can see Christ talking about
[50:55] this while he was on Earth Earth and he
[50:57] was talking to his disciples and we see
[50:59] him even in prayer foreshadowing what's
[51:01] going to happen in the near future and
[51:02] if we look at John 16:12 it says I have
[51:05] yet this is Jesus speaking I have yet
[51:08] many things to say unto you but you
[51:10] cannot bear them
[51:12] now he says but how be it when he the
[51:14] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[51:17] you into all Truth for he shall not
[51:19] speak of himself but whatsoever he shall
[51:21] hear that shall he speak and he will
[51:23] show you things to come remember what
[51:26] Jesus said I do nothing except the
[51:28] father shows me and it looks here like
[51:30] this is yes we know it's the outpouring
[51:32] of the Holy Spirit but it looks like
[51:33] there's a separation of people here it
[51:35] looks like there's a separation of
[51:37] Duties and he says whatever the Holy
[51:38] Spirit hears that's what he's going to
[51:40] give to you and he's going to talk about
[51:42] these things and he's going to show you
[51:44] things to come and then in verse 14 he
[51:46] says he shall glorify me he'll glorify
[51:48] Jesus Christ for he shall receive of
[51:51] mine and shall show it unto you so the
[51:54] holy spirit will take what is from
[51:56] Christ that is of Christ and he's going
[51:58] to reveal it to the Believers and that
[52:01] sounds like two people God bless you
[52:03] Sister Kimberly I didn't see you at the
[52:05] beginning there I think you were outside
[52:06] it's good to have you here as well it
[52:08] sounds like two people he said it almost
[52:10] sounds like a baton is going to be
[52:11] passed and Jesus is going to go up to
[52:13] heaven and he's going to go to the third
[52:15] person of the godhead and he's going to
[52:16] hand him the Baton and he's going to
[52:17] carry on the work that's what it sounds
[52:20] like amen but that's not the way it is
[52:23] we know this but let us go through the
[52:24] scripture and see it he says all all
[52:26] things that the father had are mine
[52:28] therefore said I that he shall take of
[52:30] mine and shall show it unto you so
[52:32] everything that God has has been poured
[52:34] has been passed into the person of
[52:36] Christ and he says that's going to go
[52:37] into the Holy
[52:39] Spirit again it sounds like there's a
[52:41] passing of a bon but Jesus says these
[52:44] words a little while and ye shall not
[52:46] see me and again a little while and ye
[52:49] shall see me because I go to the father
[52:51] and then he walks away he doesn't ever
[52:54] explain verse 16 he just said the facts
[52:56] and he left them hang there hanging
[52:57] there and he says in a while I'll be
[52:59] gone you won't see me like I am now but
[53:02] then you're going to see me
[53:04] again and then he says by the way I'm
[53:06] going back to the
[53:07] father and he has no explanation for how
[53:10] this is going to happen amen Jesus says
[53:12] I'm going back to the father I'm going
[53:14] back to what I was before I came here in
[53:17] other words I'm returning to what I was
[53:19] before so he says I'm coming back but
[53:22] don't look for me to come back the way
[53:24] that I left otherwise you'll miss my
[53:26] return you'll miss my revealing don't
[53:29] look for me in the same form that I left
[53:31] so Jesus has this question mark hanging
[53:33] here again I'm coming back but how am I
[53:35] going to come back but he says be ready
[53:37] for it but if we look back a few
[53:40] chapters earlier in John 14 we can
[53:42] develop the full picture and I love the
[53:44] Book of John John to me amazes me I mean
[53:46] he wrote the Book of Revelation as well
[53:48] but John has this insight into the way
[53:51] and and the revealing of God that nobody
[53:54] else had everyone else was TI back to
[53:57] the lineage of this and the lineage of
[53:58] that and one had Joseph's side and one
[54:00] had Mary's side but John takes us not
[54:03] back to Christ in a Manger but he takes
[54:05] us back to Christ the word before
[54:07] anything else ever was and that's
[54:09] because he's showing us the fullness of
[54:11] the revelation of God and I believe
[54:13] that's why he had to write the Book of
[54:15] Revelation was because God started with
[54:17] him in the when he wrote the Book of
[54:19] John as we would call it but God had to
[54:21] finish that revealing and so on the
[54:23] aisle of patmas he gives John that extra
[54:25] last bit and he shows him the full
[54:27] picture amen John had Insight that
[54:29] nobody else except Paul had nobody was
[54:31] close Peter didn't have a clue about it
[54:33] none of the other Apostles had it but
[54:35] John had it and we see that Paul would
[54:36] have it as well but Jesus is speaking
[54:39] here in John 14 and he's bringing
[54:41] Clarity to those that will listen rather
[54:43] than try and fit God in a box rather
[54:45] than fit him in their own theology I
[54:47] think that's the greatest struggle we
[54:48] face today and I I've shared with some
[54:50] of you some of the conversations I've
[54:52] had over the past 6 months or a year
[54:54] with different ones outside of this
[54:55] message outside of this church and the
[54:58] minute you say something that is outside
[55:00] of what they believe they tend to turn
[55:03] it
[55:04] off why because they're trying to fit
[55:06] God into their theology rather than
[55:09] trying to fit their theology into God
[55:11] Amen if we can run it through God rather
[55:13] than running God through us then we come
[55:15] outright I think a whole lot more than
[55:17] we wouldn't but you've got to listen to
[55:19] everything that he says and he says here
[55:21] I will pray the father and he will give
[55:23] you another comforter again it sounds
[55:25] like some some else Jesus was their
[55:27] comforter then he says another comforter
[55:28] is coming that he may abide with you
[55:31] forever even the spirit of Truth Now
[55:33] John 16 which we just read talked about
[55:35] the same Spirit of Truth and again it
[55:37] sounds like it's somebody else whom the
[55:39] world cannot receive because it seeth
[55:42] him not neither knoweth him that's in
[55:44] the present that's in the present test
[55:47] Jesus says they can't receive him
[55:49] because they don't recognize who he is
[55:51] right now anden the Holy Spirit came
[55:54] down and dwelt in the body of Jesus of
[55:56] Nazareth that was the spirit of truth
[55:58] it's God himself he says they won't
[56:00] receive him because they don't see him
[56:02] now they don't recognize him here
[56:04] they're not going to recognize him in
[56:05] the next stage that's for sure he says
[56:08] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[56:09] him but ye know him because he dwelleth
[56:14] with you present tense Spirit of Truth
[56:17] he says and shall be in you in the
[56:20] future tense so Jesus says the spirit of
[56:22] Truth the comforter one and the same
[56:24] person is coming and Jesus says you know
[56:27] this guy he's been with you all along
[56:29] he's with you right now and he's going
[56:31] to be coming in the future now he's with
[56:33] you but now soon in the future just a
[56:36] little while and he's not going to be
[56:38] just with you he's going to be in you
[56:40] there's going to be a difference
[56:42] happening in these amen because God he's
[56:45] saying God's been changing his form he
[56:47] went from God above now you see God with
[56:49] you but he's got to make a last
[56:51] transition and it's going to be God
[56:53] inside of you that's what he's trying to
[56:56] to warn them about you know it amazes me
[56:58] sometimes that that the phrases that the
[57:00] Christian World uses today and if they'd
[57:03] only listen to what they'd say theyd
[57:05] catch a revelation because what do they
[57:07] say when they ask somebody do they want
[57:09] to convert do they want to do they want
[57:11] to become a chrisan they say do you want
[57:14] Jesus to come into your
[57:17] heart well that's exactly what happens
[57:20] but then you ask them who comes in and
[57:21] they say well it's the holy spirit it's
[57:23] the Holy Ghost it's the third person of
[57:25] the Trinity but you said Jesus would
[57:27] come into his heart or her heart that's
[57:30] who comes into their heart it's Christ
[57:32] but they think it's somebody else and
[57:34] their own words testify to the reality
[57:37] and the truth of it but they don't even
[57:38] listen to
[57:39] themselves amen Jesus said the spirit of
[57:42] Truth is going to dwell in you and he
[57:44] doesn't say it's somebody else who's
[57:47] doing this transition who's making this
[57:49] change the one that dwells with them is
[57:51] making a form change so that he can
[57:53] dwell in them because Christ the flesh
[57:56] cannot come and dwell in Jonathan klette
[57:58] there's already flesh there he's got to
[58:00] change his form and who is it it's the
[58:02] one that's with them is going to be the
[58:04] one that's in them it's Christ amen it's
[58:06] not Jesus of Nazareth it's Jesus Christ
[58:09] the anointed one and Jesus leaves no
[58:11] doubt about this he says I will not
[58:13] leave you comfortless he says I will
[58:17] come to you he's the comforter he's the
[58:19] spirit of Truth he says I'm the one
[58:21] that's with you now and I'm going to be
[58:23] the one that's with you even to the End
[58:24] of the Age I'm going to to be in you so
[58:27] when you ask Christ to come into your
[58:28] heart it's not just the holy spirit it's
[58:31] Christ in the person of the Holy Spirit
[58:33] coming into you it's God himself
[58:35] stepping in it's one and the same person
[58:38] just in a different form that's all it
[58:40] is that's happening amen God stepping
[58:42] out of that flesh into spirit and into a
[58:45] pillar of fire and then he's coming
[58:47] right back into you and he's dwelling in
[58:49] your soul he says yet a little while and
[58:51] the world seeth me no more but you see
[58:54] me he doesn't say you will see me he
[58:58] says you see me that's a continuous
[59:01] thing that's going on for the believer
[59:03] is that they continue to see God no
[59:05] matter what is going on he says you see
[59:08] me one way but I'm not going to stop
[59:10] being seen as soon as I go up into the
[59:12] clouds because you're going to keep
[59:14] seeing me and it'll be a continuing
[59:15] revealing of myself in and through you
[59:18] amen it's not one and done he didn't
[59:20] leave and then we never get to see him
[59:21] but he says you will see me and he says
[59:23] because I live ye shall live also amen
[59:27] it's the indwelling Christ in us he says
[59:29] at that day what is it in a little while
[59:32] you shall know that I'm in my father and
[59:35] you're in me and I'm in you Jesus says
[59:37] you're going to understand how I can say
[59:38] that I and my father are one because
[59:40] you're going to recognize that Unity
[59:41] because I'm going to be in you the same
[59:43] way that he's inside of me it's the
[59:45] whole thing all again he says you won't
[59:46] see me like I am now but you'll see me
[59:48] nonetheless and you'll recognize what's
[59:50] going on so we're seeing this transition
[59:53] of the revealing of God and we had God
[59:55] above us in the Pillar of Fire and he
[59:57] was in a burning bush and he was a man
[59:58] called me MDC and in a pillar of cloud
[1:00:01] and all these things and then Jesus
[1:00:03] stepped or God stepped down into the
[1:00:04] body of Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus
[1:00:06] saying there's a transition coming now
[1:00:09] and I'm going back to what I was before
[1:00:12] and we see this in John again he says
[1:00:14] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:00:16] all things into his hands and that he
[1:00:18] was come from God and went to God so
[1:00:22] Jesus knows that that flesh body is
[1:00:24] going to be set aside pretty soon he's
[1:00:26] going to go through the pain and the
[1:00:27] shame and the suffering of crucifixion
[1:00:29] he's going to lay in the grave for a
[1:00:31] couple days and then what's going to
[1:00:33] happen is the spirit of God is going to
[1:00:34] take up that body and that body is going
[1:00:37] to be
[1:00:38] glorified his Celestial body his
[1:00:40] theophany is going to combine with that
[1:00:42] body and it would look just like Jesus
[1:00:44] did when he died at the end it had look
[1:00:47] like a 33 and A2 year old body in and of
[1:00:49] itself and it had a hole in its side and
[1:00:51] it had holes in the hands and holes in
[1:00:53] the feet but it was glorified amen it
[1:00:56] could go and appear anywhere it wanted
[1:00:57] it could go through walls it didn't have
[1:00:59] to go through doors it could eat food
[1:01:00] but it didn't need to have food it was a
[1:01:03] glorified body amen we look at the story
[1:01:06] of Copus and the other disciple walking
[1:01:07] to Emmas and they're talking about Jesus
[1:01:10] it says and it came to pass that when
[1:01:12] they communed together and reasoned
[1:01:14] Jesus himself Drew near and went with
[1:01:16] them watch it says but their eyes were
[1:01:18] Holden that they should not know him in
[1:01:20] other words Their Eyes Were
[1:01:22] supernaturally blinded to who he was
[1:01:27] because he was
[1:01:28] recognizable he was recognizable he
[1:01:31] looked as he did but their eyes were
[1:01:32] blinded and then he talks with them and
[1:01:34] it says and beginning of Moses and all
[1:01:36] the prophets he expounded unto them in
[1:01:38] all the scriptures the things concerning
[1:01:41] himself says and they drew nigh unto the
[1:01:44] village whether they went and he made as
[1:01:45] though he would have gone further but
[1:01:48] they constrained him saying abide with
[1:01:49] us for it is toward evening and the day
[1:01:51] is far spent and he went in to T with
[1:01:54] them and to came to pass as he sat at
[1:01:56] meat with them he took bread and blessed
[1:01:59] it and break it and gave it to them and
[1:02:02] their eyes were opened and they knew him
[1:02:05] and he vanished out of their sight he
[1:02:07] looked just as he looked he acted as he
[1:02:10] acted and as soon as the scales were
[1:02:12] removed from their eyes they recognize
[1:02:14] him and then he
[1:02:16] vanishes he's in a glorified body he can
[1:02:19] come and go as we want as he wants we
[1:02:21] see it a little later in John says after
[1:02:23] 8 days again his disciples were within
[1:02:25] and Pro with them then came Jesus the
[1:02:28] doors being shut and stood in the midst
[1:02:30] and said Peace unto you so Jesus just
[1:02:33] appears in the room the scripture is
[1:02:34] very clear he didn't walk through the
[1:02:36] door the door was shut they're in there
[1:02:38] waiting they're worrying they're
[1:02:39] wondering he could travel like a thought
[1:02:43] he could go wherever he wanted he could
[1:02:44] appear he could disappear he could hide
[1:02:46] eyes from seeing him he could let people
[1:02:48] see him he's in a glorified body amen he
[1:02:51] could decide all of these things amen
[1:02:54] and he said unto Thomas reach hither the
[1:02:55] thy finger and behold my hands and reach
[1:02:58] hither thy hand and thrust it into my
[1:02:59] side and be not faithless but believing
[1:03:02] his body had been glorified that flesh
[1:03:05] had been put into the theophany had been
[1:03:07] combined with it so it had the
[1:03:08] appearance of Flesh it still had the
[1:03:10] nature of the appearance and the holes
[1:03:12] in these things but it obviously is not
[1:03:14] holding them back it's just the
[1:03:17] glorified body and Thomas answered and
[1:03:19] said unto him my Lord and my God church
[1:03:22] if you ever had a question about the
[1:03:24] deity of Jesus Christ look at that my
[1:03:26] Lord and my God and Jesus is with them
[1:03:29] now for 40 days after that sometimes
[1:03:31] he's with them sometimes he's not
[1:03:33] they're off walking they're all fishing
[1:03:34] they're doing this and that and we see
[1:03:36] him and he comes to the Sea of tiberias
[1:03:38] and Peter's out there and Peter says I
[1:03:40] go I'm going fishing and two guys say
[1:03:41] we're going with you and so they go out
[1:03:43] and they go fishing and they're fishing
[1:03:45] all night long and they've got nothing
[1:03:47] to show for it and meanwhile Jesus comes
[1:03:49] up on the shore and they look at him and
[1:03:51] they can't see who he is they can't
[1:03:53] recognize who he is but he's got a fire
[1:03:56] going and he's got fish and these
[1:03:57] different things and so Jesus says he
[1:04:00] says did you catch anything no we
[1:04:01] haven't caught anything he says cast
[1:04:03] your net on the other side of the boat
[1:04:06] but I want to stop here in this story
[1:04:08] because it's it's key to recognizing
[1:04:10] Christ as we move forward in this series
[1:04:13] to set a foundation here just a bit
[1:04:15] watch what happens when he says cast
[1:04:17] your net on the other side because it
[1:04:20] says he said unto them cast the net on
[1:04:22] the right side of the ship and ye shall
[1:04:24] find and they cast therefore and now
[1:04:27] they were not able to draw it for the
[1:04:29] multitude of fish and there were so many
[1:04:31] fish in there they couldn't pull their
[1:04:32] net
[1:04:33] up therefore the discip that disciple
[1:04:36] whom Jesus loved I always have a giggle
[1:04:38] with John he never identifies himself by
[1:04:41] name he says that disciple whom Jesus
[1:04:44] loved you know if I if I thought Cally
[1:04:47] I'd say he had a bit of a you know a
[1:04:50] thing I'm special that disciple whom
[1:04:53] Jesus loved he didn't love any of you
[1:04:56] like he loved me I laid on his chest
[1:04:58] none of you got to do that the disciple
[1:05:00] whom Jesus loved he no no
[1:05:03] no I just it's funny to me how he does
[1:05:05] it so John said unto Peter it is the
[1:05:09] Lord how does he recognize it is Jesus
[1:05:13] not by his appearance by his word and by
[1:05:17] the result of his word amen he said unto
[1:05:20] Peter it is the Lord now when Simon
[1:05:22] Peter heard that it was the Lord he GT
[1:05:23] his Fisher's coat unto him for was naked
[1:05:26] and did cast himself into the sea so
[1:05:29] what is it Jesus did the exact same
[1:05:31] thing he' done in Mark 1 when he first
[1:05:32] went to call them to himself and they
[1:05:35] were fishing he says just go on the
[1:05:37] other side they're like no no no that's
[1:05:38] not a good idea we've been doing it all
[1:05:39] night not going to make a difference he
[1:05:40] says just do it at Thy word Lord at Thy
[1:05:43] word Lord surrender amen and they put it
[1:05:46] over on the right side and the same
[1:05:47] thing happened they brought up all those
[1:05:48] fishes and they walked away from it to
[1:05:50] come and serve and walk with Christ amen
[1:05:52] but how are they recognizing Christ
[1:05:55] they're recognizing him by what he did
[1:05:58] before amen he's identified because he's
[1:06:02] doing he's saying the same thing he did
[1:06:04] before and he's doing the same thing he
[1:06:06] did before and it's producing the same
[1:06:08] thing that it did before that ought to
[1:06:10] be a revelation to us I believe it is I
[1:06:12] believe that's why we believe this
[1:06:13] message is because we've seen him say
[1:06:16] and do and produce the same things that
[1:06:18] he did before amen that's how we ought
[1:06:21] to recognize Jesus Christ today and I
[1:06:23] say that to those particularly that are
[1:06:24] listening to me by way of streaming this
[1:06:26] evening if you want to see Jesus Christ
[1:06:29] today look at what is said and what is
[1:06:31] done and what are the results because
[1:06:33] it's supposed to be Jesus Christ the
[1:06:35] same yesterday today and forever don't
[1:06:39] look at the rapper never look at the
[1:06:41] rapper look at what's coming out of it
[1:06:44] now I'm not saying don't look at the
[1:06:45] rapper ever if you got if somebody's
[1:06:47] literally a rapper if somebody's
[1:06:49] professing to be a Christian and they've
[1:06:51] got all the things of the world on them
[1:06:53] that can't be him you still have to have
[1:06:55] a Sanctified life you still have to be
[1:06:57] have a life that reflects the Holiness
[1:07:00] of of God and these different things but
[1:07:02] don't throw it away because it doesn't
[1:07:03] come in the package you anticipated CU
[1:07:06] it's never come the way the people
[1:07:07] wanted amen it's such a simple test
[1:07:10] church if you want to identify Christ
[1:07:13] find where the word is and where the
[1:07:15] word is that's where you'll find Christ
[1:07:17] because Christ is the word amen and the
[1:07:20] people today have built up a Jesus a
[1:07:22] Jesus Christ that's of their own making
[1:07:23] they built up a religious system a
[1:07:25] belief system and it always lacks the
[1:07:28] reality of the word of God brother
[1:07:30] Braham says they always put away the
[1:07:33] supernatural amen they have a Jesus that
[1:07:35] makes them feel good they have a Jesus
[1:07:37] that lets them live in a way that that
[1:07:39] works for them they have a Jesus that
[1:07:40] gives them religious satisfaction but
[1:07:42] what they don't have is Jesus Christ the
[1:07:44] same yesterday today and forever and to
[1:07:47] do that they have to take this Bible and
[1:07:49] I won't do it they have to rip Pages out
[1:07:51] of that book because it doesn't apply to
[1:07:53] them and they can't receive it and so
[1:07:55] they miss him because God never changes
[1:07:58] as the word he never changes the form
[1:08:00] changes the visible part changes but
[1:08:02] Christ the word never changes amen but
[1:08:05] Jesus told his disciples the change
[1:08:07] coming change change is coming you've
[1:08:09] got to be ready for it you've got to be
[1:08:10] ready for it and then we come to acts
[1:08:12] one where Paul writes about what's
[1:08:14] happening at the very end of Jesus
[1:08:16] Earthly Ministry and in Acts 1 and one
[1:08:18] it says this former treaties have I made
[1:08:20] o theophus of all that Jesus
[1:08:23] began all that Jesus
[1:08:28] began wow I thought we were going
[1:08:34] then all that Jesus began to do and
[1:08:37] teach until the day in which he was
[1:08:39] taken up after that he through the Holy
[1:08:42] Ghost had given Commandments unto the
[1:08:44] apostles whom he had chosen so notice
[1:08:46] now Jesus in literal body form taught
[1:08:50] and did things with the disciples but
[1:08:52] then he says after the Holy Spirit he is
[1:08:55] is still continuing working in and
[1:08:58] through the apostles and it's the same
[1:09:00] Christ Paul makes no distinction between
[1:09:04] Jesus in literal body form and the Holy
[1:09:07] Spirit he says he's doing the same
[1:09:10] things he through the Holy Ghost it's
[1:09:14] just a different form it's the same one
[1:09:16] it's the same person Amen to whom also
[1:09:19] he showed himself alive after his
[1:09:21] Passion by many infallible proofs being
[1:09:23] seen of them 40 days and speaking of the
[1:09:26] things pertaining to the kingdom of God
[1:09:28] so Jesus Was preparing them for this
[1:09:30] transition the final portion of the
[1:09:32] revealing of God it says and being
[1:09:34] assembled together with them commanded
[1:09:36] them that they should not depart from
[1:09:37] Jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:09:40] the Father which saith he ye have heard
[1:09:43] of me so he's saying the spirit of Truth
[1:09:45] is coming the comforter is coming I'm
[1:09:47] coming back to you he's saying go there
[1:09:50] and wait for it wait for the promise to
[1:09:52] happen for John truly baptized with
[1:09:54] water but ye shall be baptized with the
[1:09:57] Holy Ghost not many days hence when they
[1:09:59] therefore were come together they asked
[1:10:01] of him saying Lord wil thou at this time
[1:10:04] restore again the kingdom to Israel he
[1:10:06] says it's not for you to know the times
[1:10:09] or the seasons which the father hath put
[1:10:11] in his own power but ye shall receive
[1:10:14] one thing
[1:10:15] power power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:10:18] has come upon you church I want to stop
[1:10:20] there we're going to do a whole at least
[1:10:21] one whole service on just that one
[1:10:23] scripture but I want you to catch with
[1:10:25] what this power is I was listening to to
[1:10:28] uh someone this week and they're talking
[1:10:30] about the the the disciples and they
[1:10:32] said what we don't have today is the
[1:10:34] ability that the disciples had to go and
[1:10:36] heal people according to their own will
[1:10:39] and it's a complete misunderstanding of
[1:10:40] scripture Christ himself never went
[1:10:43] around healing people of his own will so
[1:10:45] how could the disciples be doing it but
[1:10:47] yet they had power before this ever
[1:10:49] happened to raise the dead to heal the
[1:10:52] sick to cast out
[1:10:54] demons so that is not the power that
[1:10:56] we're looking for that comes with it but
[1:10:59] that is not the power that they needed
[1:11:01] on the day of Pentecost they needed a
[1:11:03] power to change that's what they needed
[1:11:05] not power to raise the dead not power to
[1:11:07] do signs and wonders that was already in
[1:11:09] their lives they needed power for a
[1:11:11] personal indwelling change that would
[1:11:13] never that would never that that would
[1:11:15] never go away Peter had an up and down
[1:11:17] Christian walk until then he needed
[1:11:19] something that would flatten him out
[1:11:21] amen that would keep him on the straight
[1:11:23] and narrow amen keep him from going back
[1:11:24] and forth and up and down and in and out
[1:11:26] of the kingdom of God that's the power
[1:11:28] we need today everything else comes
[1:11:30] afterwards these signs shall follow that
[1:11:33] comes afterwards but you need a a a
[1:11:36] holding power an anchor in this soul to
[1:11:39] so that God can use you so he can get
[1:11:41] you settled so he can clean you up and
[1:11:43] get you ready for him to use in a real
[1:11:46] way amen you shall receive power after
[1:11:49] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:11:50] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both
[1:11:52] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[1:11:55] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1:11:57] the earth and when he had spoken these
[1:11:59] things while they beheld he was taken up
[1:12:02] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:12:04] sight and guess what we don't get to see
[1:12:06] that person the world doesn't get to see
[1:12:09] that body until he comes back with
[1:12:11] 10,000 times 10,000 of his Saints as
[1:12:14] king of kings and Lord of lords that's
[1:12:17] the that's the next time they're going
[1:12:18] to see him remember at the time of the
[1:12:20] Resurrection The Rapture we meet him in
[1:12:22] the clouds we may get to see him in that
[1:12:24] form
[1:12:25] but nobody else will get to see him and
[1:12:27] the world doesn't get to see him until
[1:12:28] he comes in judgment amen but what does
[1:12:31] what happens is that body just gets set
[1:12:33] aside it just gets set aside and what
[1:12:36] does Jesus do he goes right back into
[1:12:38] the pillar of fire amen he goes back to
[1:12:40] what he was before remember we read the
[1:12:42] scripture he says I come from God I go
[1:12:44] back to God and what was he doing he was
[1:12:45] going back to his original form before
[1:12:48] he walked in flesh he knew what he was
[1:12:50] before he walked this world in flesh he
[1:12:53] knew what he was bam would say this he
[1:12:54] says before you were born God ordained
[1:12:57] you to be a Christian from the Garden of
[1:12:59] Eden from before the foundation of the
[1:13:01] world that's the
[1:13:02] truth hallelujah that is my anchor every
[1:13:06] single day that I live this Christian
[1:13:08] Life is that he chose me he declared me
[1:13:11] I did not choose him he says before
[1:13:14] there was ever you knew anything there
[1:13:16] was a time you knew your mind is
[1:13:18] darkened to that now he said there's
[1:13:20] only been one man on Earth that knew
[1:13:22] that he was before and that was Jesus he
[1:13:25] said glorify me father with the glory
[1:13:27] that I have with you before the
[1:13:29] foundation of the world he was the
[1:13:31] Incarnate God he could move back there
[1:13:33] and know what it was he says but our
[1:13:35] minds are blackened there he knew who he
[1:13:38] was I come from God I go back to God
[1:13:41] glorify me with the glory which I had
[1:13:42] before the world began what is it in the
[1:13:45] pillar of fire the very indwelling God
[1:13:48] Amen but remember what he said he says
[1:13:50] I'm going to be in you he doesn't say a
[1:13:52] second person or a third person of the
[1:13:54] Trinity he says I'll be in you in the
[1:13:56] form of the Holy Spirit and that would
[1:13:58] be the final revealing of God to
[1:14:00] humanity he said he would be with us and
[1:14:03] he said that he would be in us so we've
[1:14:06] got a God that's with us and in us so
[1:14:07] now we've got two forms at the end if we
[1:14:09] wanted to look at it that way it was
[1:14:11] Pillar of Fire then it was Christ but
[1:14:13] now at the end he says I'm going to be
[1:14:14] with you and I'm going to be in you so
[1:14:16] there's going to be a different
[1:14:17] revealing of God Amen and so now the
[1:14:20] question is what's that last part going
[1:14:22] to look like what's going to fill in
[1:14:23] those two question marks there there
[1:14:26] amen how will God reveal himself in this
[1:14:28] final way how will Jesus Christ come
[1:14:31] again and live inside of us amen what is
[1:14:33] his form and body now that's the
[1:14:35] question we're asking where is Jesus
[1:14:37] Christ today it's a good question we
[1:14:40] come to Acts 2 and the disciples and the
[1:14:43] followers of Jesus have been in the
[1:14:44] upper room all 120 of them for 10 days
[1:14:47] and they've been waiting Jesus said
[1:14:50] Terry in other words wait until
[1:14:52] something
[1:14:54] happens wait until something happens
[1:14:56] because if they tried to be what he said
[1:14:58] they were going to be if they tried to
[1:14:59] do what he said they would do before
[1:15:01] this happened they were going to fail
[1:15:03] miserably religious experience wasn't
[1:15:05] going to carry him over an anointing on
[1:15:07] them was not going to take them forward
[1:15:09] he says I've got to be in you before you
[1:15:12] move forward in your ministry and this
[1:15:15] is a very familiar scripture in Acts 2
[1:15:17] it says and when the day of Pentecost
[1:15:18] was fully come they were all with one
[1:15:21] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[1:15:23] came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[1:15:25] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[1:15:27] where they were sitting and there
[1:15:29] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[1:15:31] as of fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:15:34] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:15:36] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:15:38] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:15:40] utterance so Jesus said I'm going to be
[1:15:42] with you and then I'm going to be in you
[1:15:44] and then the Acts 2 says the Holy Ghost
[1:15:46] filled them and what does it look like
[1:15:49] it looks like tongues of
[1:15:52] fire what did Christ go back to the
[1:15:55] Pillar of Fire and now what do we see
[1:15:57] happening in representation the The
[1:16:00] Dwelling Place of God the pillar of fire
[1:16:02] comes down and now that is coming back
[1:16:05] on the True Believers and so we can look
[1:16:08] at that picture and we can see God With
[1:16:11] Us what is it it's the pillar of fire
[1:16:13] all over again but that didn't just stop
[1:16:16] and hang over them but it went down into
[1:16:18] their souls and now it's God in us and
[1:16:20] now we have a picture of God With Us and
[1:16:22] in us and it's the Holy Spirit in the
[1:16:25] form of the pillar of fire again that's
[1:16:27] what's inside of each and every one of
[1:16:29] us
[1:16:30] Amen brother BR says it this way he says
[1:16:33] and God had to become flesh in order to
[1:16:36] take the sinner's Place God manifested
[1:16:38] In the Flesh nothing less than God
[1:16:40] himself now here he was manifested in
[1:16:43] the flesh to take away the sins of the
[1:16:44] world and he identified himself in us he
[1:16:48] identified himself in human flesh that
[1:16:50] we might be identified in him in deity
[1:16:54] so deity drops into flesh so that flesh
[1:16:56] can become deity that's what he's saying
[1:16:58] here there's a purpose he says see the
[1:17:01] purpose of it now we find out our
[1:17:03] identification with our sacrifice the
[1:17:05] life of the sacrifice in us which is the
[1:17:08] holy spirit we're talking about the
[1:17:09] token life he says when that cell was
[1:17:12] broken it released God that he had
[1:17:15] Sanctified a people with his own blood
[1:17:17] and put God in the man again he says God
[1:17:21] in you eternal life God in you he says
[1:17:25] when that blood cell was broken in Jesus
[1:17:28] it released the life back to us so he
[1:17:30] could come back in us remember we
[1:17:32] preached on on the atonement and how in
[1:17:35] at the beginning of this series how that
[1:17:37] the original token was the blood of the
[1:17:39] animal but but the purpose of the blood
[1:17:41] and the sacrifice was so that the life
[1:17:43] of the innocent could become the life of
[1:17:45] the guilty they would take my life my
[1:17:48] guiltiness and I would take on their
[1:17:50] righteousness but it couldn't happen
[1:17:51] because it was an animal and an animal
[1:17:53] life is not compatible with you human
[1:17:55] life but when a human body could die
[1:17:57] that life could now come into me and it
[1:17:59] could take my sins and I could take his
[1:18:02] righteousness and I could stand redeemed
[1:18:04] I could stand perfect I could stand
[1:18:05] acceptable before God that's what he's
[1:18:07] saying here he says now any Greek
[1:18:10] scholar knows that word eternal life
[1:18:12] comes the word zede Zoe which means
[1:18:15] God's own life he says that's right the
[1:18:17] only way you can ever have life there's
[1:18:20] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:18:23] God's own life in you see then you have
[1:18:25] eternal life because he's the only
[1:18:27] Eternal there is and he says we are the
[1:18:29] attributes of his thoughts before there
[1:18:32] was even a foundation of the world or
[1:18:33] anything all this is just his thinking
[1:18:37] and where the display of his thoughts of
[1:18:40] what it
[1:18:42] was he says therefore as the evening
[1:18:46] Shadows now are appearing and wrath is
[1:18:49] ready to be poured out from on high upon
[1:18:52] the ungodly Nations and upon the ungodly
[1:18:54] unbeliever
[1:18:55] upon the professors without a possession
[1:18:58] upon those things he says I've tried to
[1:19:00] unfold myself and live right among it to
[1:19:03] see where it was standing before I said
[1:19:05] these things he says now we are living
[1:19:07] in the shadows and the Wrath is ready to
[1:19:09] strike and God is requiring a token that
[1:19:13] you yourself have received his token the
[1:19:17] Holy Ghost he says it's the only way and
[1:19:20] the only sign that God will ever pass
[1:19:23] because it is the literal life of Jesus
[1:19:27] Christ return back into the
[1:19:32] believer church this is God living
[1:19:35] inside of you that's what we're talking
[1:19:38] about this is not just a flame of fire
[1:19:40] this is not just a good feeling it's not
[1:19:43] just a church experience it's not just a
[1:19:44] camp experience amen God when he filled
[1:19:47] you with the Holy Spirit placed himself
[1:19:51] inside of you and from that moment
[1:19:53] you've been changed from death unto life
[1:19:56] that's what happened in that moment you
[1:19:57] went from death into eternal life and
[1:20:00] this body yes it can be destroyed it can
[1:20:02] die in time for now but that soul is
[1:20:05] sealed eternally it is the dwelling
[1:20:07] place of God and the moment we pass from
[1:20:10] this life we go into a body waiting for
[1:20:12] us there and we wait until that
[1:20:14] resurrection and Rapture morning and
[1:20:15] then we just come back and we pick this
[1:20:17] body up and it's glorified and we have a
[1:20:19] glorious body just like he had here
[1:20:22] that's what this does to us it cannot we
[1:20:25] cannot die amen it is just like the body
[1:20:28] of Christ amen but I want to drive that
[1:20:31] home this evening do not cheapen the
[1:20:33] baptism of the Holy Spirit and that
[1:20:35] sounds like a simp like John brother
[1:20:38] John who would do that but I think
[1:20:40] sometimes we take it and we say well
[1:20:41] it's only a portion of God it's only a
[1:20:44] little bit of God it's a little bit of
[1:20:47] everything you can't take a little bit
[1:20:49] of everything and have anything less
[1:20:50] than everything when you take a portion
[1:20:52] of infinite it's still infinite you
[1:20:54] can't break it up when you have all
[1:20:56] knowing all
[1:20:58] powerful inside of you that is all
[1:21:01] inside of you you take a spoonful of the
[1:21:04] ocean you get everything that's in the
[1:21:05] ocean you take a drop of God inside of
[1:21:07] you and you have everything that is he
[1:21:09] is inside of you so often we think well
[1:21:13] because I don't have the fullness I
[1:21:15] can't be just like Christ says who says
[1:21:18] who not
[1:21:20] me not me Jesus said listen I am the
[1:21:23] light of the world and then by the end
[1:21:25] he's saying you are the light of the
[1:21:26] world he's saying there's got to be a
[1:21:28] change here and when I go away
[1:21:30] somebody's got to carry the torch and
[1:21:32] you've got to be able to be the same
[1:21:34] life that I
[1:21:35] am let's not cheapen it let's not say I
[1:21:38] can't do this because I don't have all
[1:21:40] of God God has given us enough of
[1:21:43] himself to achieve everything his word
[1:21:45] says amen whatever battle we're facing
[1:21:49] whatever blockages this flesh has
[1:21:51] whatever nature that we have from our
[1:21:53] DNA whatever it might be whatever our
[1:21:55] struggles are there is a God that is
[1:21:58] greater than all of that dwelling on the
[1:21:59] inside this evening so whether it's
[1:22:02] sickness whether it's an attitude
[1:22:03] problem whether it's the thoughts that
[1:22:05] you have whether it's the inclinations
[1:22:07] that this flesh has it matters not when
[1:22:09] God is living inside of you and we can
[1:22:12] surrender ourselves to him there is
[1:22:14] nothing he cannot do this evening
[1:22:16] there's nothing he can't do tomorrow as
[1:22:18] the change comes up and as the
[1:22:20] challenges come up and as situations
[1:22:21] come up we have an answer to every
[1:22:24] single thing that we face in this life
[1:22:26] and it is God indwelling in you and God
[1:22:29] indwelling with me
[1:22:32] amen what have that to do to our faith
[1:22:34] this evening what have that to do with
[1:22:36] our struggles and our thoughts and the
[1:22:37] things that we we have challenges in our
[1:22:40] life day by day I am firmly convinced
[1:22:42] Church there is more to this experience
[1:22:44] than what I have seen so
[1:22:46] far amen there is more there is more I
[1:22:50] have seen wonderful gifts I've seen
[1:22:52] wonderful manifestations I have felt the
[1:22:54] presence of God in amazing ways but I
[1:22:57] want a greater reality day by day and I
[1:22:59] say Lord live through me live through me
[1:23:03] if through nobody else live through me I
[1:23:05] can't make him live in you I can't make
[1:23:06] you desire but I say Lord let him live
[1:23:08] through me in a greater way than he did
[1:23:10] yesterday and the only way he can do it
[1:23:12] is the more that I Surrender the more
[1:23:15] that I Surrender the more that I lay
[1:23:17] myself down and say Lord let your will
[1:23:19] be my will let your words be my words
[1:23:21] let your thoughts be my thoughts let
[1:23:23] your actions be my actions
[1:23:25] let your reaction be my reaction amen
[1:23:28] what holds us back prophet of God said
[1:23:31] it we don't recognize who we
[1:23:34] are it's not just the fact that I'm a
[1:23:37] child of God and you're a child of God
[1:23:39] it's that God is living inside of
[1:23:42] us I don't know if we can contain that
[1:23:44] thought but one day it's going to
[1:23:45] Rapture us brother Braham says when she
[1:23:48] recognizes when the bride recognizes who
[1:23:51] she
[1:23:52] is the rapture will go go that means
[1:23:56] there's more to be revealed that means
[1:23:58] there's a greater Revelation there's a
[1:23:59] greater reality that's coming that's why
[1:24:01] I believe there's a call in my life and
[1:24:03] a desire in my life for more of him is
[1:24:05] because there's more of him to be
[1:24:06] revealed there's more of him to be had
[1:24:08] there's more of him to to do greater
[1:24:11] things in our life
[1:24:12] amen but we see Christ and he he's
[1:24:15] shifting and he's shifting and God went
[1:24:17] from a pillar fire in the beginning to a
[1:24:19] man called Jesus of Nazareth then he
[1:24:21] goes back into the pillar of fire and we
[1:24:23] see that it's Christ All Through the
[1:24:27] Ages amen he came as fire then he came
[1:24:29] as a body then he goes back to that
[1:24:31] Pillar of Fire all over again brother
[1:24:34] Brown would say this he says and God
[1:24:35] being infinite he cannot say well I was
[1:24:39] mistaken 2,000 years ago God is eternal
[1:24:42] he never did begin he never will end he
[1:24:45] says and the only way you can ever be
[1:24:47] like him is to be part of him that great
[1:24:50] Pillar of Fire that Israel had followed
[1:24:52] through the Wilderness that great Pillar
[1:24:53] of Fire was God the angel of the
[1:24:56] Covenant Jesus Christ he quotes
[1:24:59] scripture he says Moses esteemed the
[1:25:00] reproach of Christ greater Treasures
[1:25:02] than that of Egypt so he forsook Egypt
[1:25:04] and followed Christ he says notice on
[1:25:07] the day of Pentecost what did God do he
[1:25:10] took that big Pillar of Fire and divided
[1:25:13] it he says that was
[1:25:16] himself he said tongues of fire fork
[1:25:19] tongues clothing tongues come down Fork
[1:25:22] tongues and said upon each one but I
[1:25:24] want to jump back real quick here
[1:25:26] because brother B references that
[1:25:27] scripture of Moses and he doesn't quote
[1:25:29] it exactly right and for clarity I
[1:25:31] wanted to to quote it this this evening
[1:25:33] just to make this point as we start to
[1:25:35] close he says by faith Moses when he was
[1:25:38] come to
[1:25:39] years refused to be called the son of
[1:25:41] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:25:44] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[1:25:46] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:25:48] season and Paul says Moses esteem or he
[1:25:52] was esteeming the repr approach of
[1:25:56] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[1:25:58] in Egypt for he had respect under the
[1:26:01] recompense of the reward what was moses'
[1:26:04] experience moses' experience was what
[1:26:06] the burning bush that called himself I
[1:26:10] am that was moses' experience Jesus said
[1:26:14] before Abraham was I am so who was it in
[1:26:17] the burning bush it was Christ in a body
[1:26:20] of fire and then what does he do he
[1:26:21] comes to his own people and he tells the
[1:26:23] story and he says I met God I met I am I
[1:26:27] am sent me and he told me what I'm going
[1:26:29] to do and he told me we're going to get
[1:26:30] out of here and perhaps he was
[1:26:34] rejected and he was made fun of and
[1:26:37] people tried to copy him and he faced
[1:26:39] hardship for Time After Time After Time
[1:26:42] and he took that reproach for a while
[1:26:44] but in the end what
[1:26:46] happened exactly what God Said would
[1:26:49] happen but he had to bear that reproach
[1:26:52] for the longest time he bore the
[1:26:53] reproach of being a a deliverer That
[1:26:54] Couldn't
[1:26:55] deliver of trying and failing but yet
[1:26:59] the word of God was in him he was a
[1:27:01] portion of that word
[1:27:03] amen but notice why Moses did what he
[1:27:06] did the scripture says he had respect
[1:27:08] under the recompense of the reward that
[1:27:11] that means he looked forward and away to
[1:27:13] the reward he didn't look at the path
[1:27:16] that he was going through he looked at
[1:27:17] what waited at the end of the path it's
[1:27:19] the same thing Jesus did for the joy
[1:27:21] that laid before him he went to the
[1:27:23] cross
[1:27:24] Moses looked and he saw the path he saw
[1:27:26] it was the The Way of the rejected it's
[1:27:29] the way of the few nobody was going to
[1:27:31] believe him he was going to have to go
[1:27:32] through hard times but like Christ he
[1:27:35] saw what was at the end of it and on
[1:27:36] that he said I'll do it and he went of
[1:27:39] his own free
[1:27:40] will but who did he experience he had
[1:27:43] experienced Christ Paul
[1:27:46] said not Jehovah he doesn't say it was
[1:27:48] Jehovah he doesn't even call him Lord he
[1:27:51] says it was Christ the anointed one in
[1:27:54] the pillar of fire and if we look at who
[1:27:56] that Pillar of Fire is we can look at
[1:27:58] Saul who became Paul his own experience
[1:28:01] on the road to Damascus and we've talked
[1:28:02] about this many times but just to close
[1:28:05] this and wrap it up in a nice bow tie
[1:28:07] this evening Saul it says yet breathing
[1:28:10] out threatenings and Slaughters against
[1:28:12] the Disciples of the Lord went under the
[1:28:14] high priest and desired of him letters
[1:28:16] to Damascus to the synagogues that if he
[1:28:18] found any of this way if he found any
[1:28:20] Christians whether they were men or
[1:28:22] women he might bring them bound under
[1:28:24] Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came
[1:28:26] near Damascus and suddenly there shined
[1:28:29] round about him a light from Heaven what
[1:28:31] is it what is that light it's a pillar
[1:28:34] of light it's a pillar of fire it's the
[1:28:36] same thing that Moses saw on the
[1:28:38] mountain it's the same thing that led
[1:28:40] the children of Israel it's the same as
[1:28:41] the burning bush it's light from Heaven
[1:28:44] it's the dwelling place of
[1:28:46] God he said and he fell to the Earth and
[1:28:49] heard a voice this is a speaking
[1:28:52] light again where do we see that we see
[1:28:54] that with Moses we see that the pillar
[1:28:56] of fire in different places and it said
[1:28:58] unto him saying Saul Saul why
[1:29:01] persecutest thou me and he said who art
[1:29:05] thou
[1:29:06] Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[1:29:09] thou persecutest it is hard for thee to
[1:29:12] kick against the Pricks now notice when
[1:29:14] the pillar fire came down on the day of
[1:29:16] Pentecost it divided itself in the upper
[1:29:20] room amen so now the Holy Spirit Christ
[1:29:23] himself is in dwelling 120 people and
[1:29:26] then Peter goes down the stairs preaches
[1:29:28] the sermon of his life and 3,000 other
[1:29:31] people get the Holy Ghost so now we've
[1:29:33] got
[1:29:34] 3,120 people with the Holy
[1:29:37] Ghost 3,120 people with the spirit of
[1:29:41] Truth 3,120 people with the
[1:29:46] comforter Jesus said I'll come to you
[1:29:48] I'll be with you and I'll be in you and
[1:29:50] so 3,120 people have Jesus Christ living
[1:29:54] on the inside in the form of the Holy
[1:29:56] Spirit now Saul is riding a horse on his
[1:29:58] way to Damascus and that pillar fire
[1:30:01] knocks him off of his high horse and
[1:30:03] Saul who's well versed in the word says
[1:30:05] who are you cuz he says Saul Saul why
[1:30:09] are you persecuting me and Saul says who
[1:30:12] are you talking
[1:30:14] about this is a light speaking from
[1:30:17] Heaven saying Saul you're persecuting
[1:30:20] me has Saul been throwing a pillar of
[1:30:22] light into the jails has he been
[1:30:24] whipping them beating
[1:30:26] them Saul hasn't touched the pillar of
[1:30:29] fire Saul hasn't touched the literal
[1:30:31] body of Jesus but this Pillar of Fire
[1:30:33] says you've been persecuting me and he
[1:30:35] says who are you Lord and what does the
[1:30:38] pillar of fire say I'm
[1:30:42] Jesus I'm Jesus that you're
[1:30:46] persecuting God had changed his form yet
[1:30:49] again and now he's in a pillar of fire
[1:30:51] and he's revealed his proper name and he
[1:30:52] says it's Jesus
[1:30:57] but Watch What Happens
[1:30:59] now because Paul confirms who he talked
[1:31:02] to 1 Corinthians 15:3 says for I have
[1:31:05] delivered unto you first of all that
[1:31:07] which I received how that Christ died
[1:31:09] for our sins according to the scriptures
[1:31:12] and that he was buried and that he rose
[1:31:14] again on the third day according to the
[1:31:15] scriptures and that he was seen of
[1:31:18] sephus then of the 12 when was he seen
[1:31:20] of them in a glorified body look just
[1:31:24] like flesh right after that he was seen
[1:31:26] of above 500 Brethren at once of whom
[1:31:28] the greater part remain unto this
[1:31:30] present but some are falling asleep he
[1:31:31] says he appeared to 500 or more people
[1:31:35] and many of them are still alive
[1:31:36] listening to me or reading my my service
[1:31:38] or or my message here some have died he
[1:31:41] says and after that he was seen of James
[1:31:43] then of all the apostles in what form in
[1:31:45] that glorified flesh in a physical body
[1:31:48] looking human like that and then Paul
[1:31:50] says and last of all he was seen of me
[1:31:55] also as one born out of due time now how
[1:31:59] did Paul see him as a pillar of fire and
[1:32:02] Paul makes no distinction between the
[1:32:04] Jesus he saw and the Jesus that they
[1:32:07] saw none whatsoever he says I saw the
[1:32:11] same Jesus and yet the visible
[1:32:13] appearance was completely different one
[1:32:15] was a light from Heaven and the other
[1:32:17] one was a physical body and Paul said I
[1:32:20] saw Jesus the same as you did not only
[1:32:23] that but that Jesus that was in that
[1:32:25] Pillar of Fire says you're persecuting
[1:32:27] me and like I said Paul Saul was now
[1:32:31] going around throwing Jesus into jail he
[1:32:34] wasn't throwing a pillar of fire into
[1:32:35] jail he couldn't touch that Pillar of
[1:32:36] Fire he didn't know he had no experience
[1:32:38] with that Pillar of Fire until now but
[1:32:40] who was Paul doing that to he was doing
[1:32:42] it to
[1:32:43] Believers he was doing it to people that
[1:32:46] had been in the upper room people that
[1:32:48] had received the New Birth by the Holy
[1:32:50] Spirit and Jesus comes and he says
[1:32:53] there's three ,1 120 of me on this Earth
[1:32:56] and you're persecuting me what is it
[1:32:59] it's the final revealing of
[1:33:02] Christ Jesus himself makes no difference
[1:33:05] between brother Mark and the pillar of
[1:33:09] fire that's what he's saying he's saying
[1:33:11] Saul you're persecuting me in flesh all
[1:33:14] over again and the only difference is
[1:33:17] the literal
[1:33:18] body same pillar fire as in brother Mark
[1:33:21] as is is in Sister Kimberly back there
[1:33:23] in the corner
[1:33:24] and for everyone that's received the new
[1:33:25] birth this evening Christ himself made
[1:33:28] no distinction between him in that
[1:33:30] Pillar of Fire and you walking this road
[1:33:33] this evening he says it's all
[1:33:36] me if trinitarians believe that everyone
[1:33:39] that has the the the life of God in them
[1:33:41] is a part of the godhead then now we've
[1:33:42] got
[1:33:43] 3,123 people at a minimum in the
[1:33:47] godhead but that's not it it's just the
[1:33:49] same God revealing himself over and over
[1:33:53] and over again and what was Christ
[1:33:55] saying to Paul he was saying Paul you
[1:33:57] didn't C Saul you didn't catch it I was
[1:34:00] there in flesh but I've changed my form
[1:34:02] and I'm in flesh all over again and it's
[1:34:04] me Paul it's me that you're doing this
[1:34:07] too
[1:34:10] amen Paul would continue in Colossians
[1:34:12] he says
[1:34:13] wherefore I am made a minister according
[1:34:16] to the dispensation of God which is
[1:34:18] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[1:34:20] of God even the mystery which had been
[1:34:22] hid from a ages and from Generations but
[1:34:26] now this was hidden for thousands of
[1:34:29] years he says but now it's made manifest
[1:34:33] to who his Saints to whom God will make
[1:34:36] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:34:39] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:34:43] Christ in you the hope of glory what a
[1:34:47] scripture Church the final revealing the
[1:34:51] the the grand reveal the thing that God
[1:34:53] has been trying to do for thousands and
[1:34:56] thousands of years Paul says it's here
[1:34:59] and it's
[1:35:00] you every saint every True Believer that
[1:35:03] has received the Holy Spirit God is now
[1:35:06] revealing himself through you God above
[1:35:09] us in the pillar of fire God With Us in
[1:35:11] the form of a man named Jesus and now
[1:35:13] he's living in a multi-member body
[1:35:16] called the bride of Christ and that is
[1:35:18] the final revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:35:21] that's the final revealing of Jesus
[1:35:23] Christ is in you and I as we said before
[1:35:25] Jesus said there I am the light of the
[1:35:27] world why because the light was dwelling
[1:35:29] in him and that light was the life of
[1:35:31] men the scripture says but that light
[1:35:34] now goes into you and
[1:35:36] I into you and I and now ye are the
[1:35:39] light of the world and he says a city on
[1:35:42] a hill cannot be hidden I've been
[1:35:44] listening to the Token I listened to it
[1:35:45] just a few months ago at the start of
[1:35:47] this and I'm listening to it again and I
[1:35:48] shared it with some of some of the the
[1:35:50] the people in The church here yesterday
[1:35:52] I think it was and he says you you
[1:35:53] cannot hide that
[1:35:55] token you cannot hide it it has to be on
[1:35:58] display and he says you think well I
[1:36:00] don't want so and so at work to know or
[1:36:02] I don't want this one to know he says
[1:36:03] you cannot hide it it has to be public
[1:36:06] in order to be
[1:36:08] recognized amen that's the mystery that
[1:36:11] God's been trying to reveal up to 4,000
[1:36:14] years before Pentecost and there were
[1:36:16] glimpses of it and we'll touch on that
[1:36:17] as we go through this series amen We
[1:36:19] There were types and shadows showing
[1:36:21] that Christ was revealing himself and he
[1:36:22] would be revealed in the prop phets and
[1:36:24] he'd be revealed in the heroes of the
[1:36:25] faith men and women alike amen but now
[1:36:29] now we're in the final revealing and if
[1:36:31] you look at it it goes through seven
[1:36:33] Church
[1:36:34] ages and it's at the beginning he says
[1:36:36] it's me I'm Alpha and then at the end he
[1:36:40] says I'm Omega and it's the revealing of
[1:36:42] Christ at the beginning in that first
[1:36:43] church age and now he's right back here
[1:36:45] and he's doing the same thing in this
[1:36:47] church age and it's in you and me seven
[1:36:49] Church ages seven part portions of the
[1:36:53] Bride seven battles seven groups of
[1:36:55] Overcomers and every one of them had the
[1:36:58] same thing in common they could hear
[1:37:00] what the spirit was saying they could
[1:37:02] identify where the word was they could
[1:37:05] accept it they could obey it and they
[1:37:08] could live it and that's all it took
[1:37:12] doesn't sound like much does it if you
[1:37:14] can hear what the spirit's saying and
[1:37:15] you can listen to it and you can receive
[1:37:17] it you'll be an
[1:37:18] overcomer because what it's not
[1:37:21] something outside of you it's something
[1:37:22] that comes inside of you we're not here
[1:37:24] to listen to Services we're not here to
[1:37:26] listen to a preacher we're here to
[1:37:27] receive the engrafted word amen that's
[1:37:30] what's going on and the spirit quickens
[1:37:32] that inside of our life and that's what
[1:37:33] it produces is a son and a daughter of
[1:37:36] God Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:37:38] today and forever that's you amen that's
[1:37:41] you let's stand if we
[1:37:44] would
[1:37:47] amen can you imagine walking out those
[1:37:52] doors and you tell somebody if you want
[1:37:54] to see Jesus Christ look at me not out
[1:37:57] of Pride not out of Pride but say if you
[1:38:00] want to see Jesus Christ he's right
[1:38:03] here not the person the way he was not
[1:38:05] in the sinless Perfection but there is a
[1:38:08] life inside of me that I can't live
[1:38:11] except that he lives inside of me and
[1:38:13] what you're seeing is nothing less than
[1:38:15] God veiled in flesh all over again the
[1:38:18] world can't receive it but yet you'll
[1:38:21] run into people you'll run into people
[1:38:23] and they see something and they don't
[1:38:25] know what it is and it draws them and it
[1:38:28] draws them and it draws them and by
[1:38:30] God's grace they'll come
[1:38:32] in and sometimes it takes
[1:38:35] decades and sometimes they literally
[1:38:37] meet you once and it's like a light
[1:38:39] switch goes off and they recognize what
[1:38:42] you have who you have and who you are
[1:38:46] and they say I want that some of them
[1:38:48] are the most religious people in the
[1:38:49] world and some of them are the darkest
[1:38:51] most lost people you'd ever meet and yet
[1:38:53] there's a seed inside of them that comes
[1:38:55] through a quickening when they come
[1:38:57] across the word and it's not a word that
[1:38:58] you preach it's a word that's alive amen
[1:39:02] it's Christ Living in you the hope of
[1:39:04] glory amen what do you see in that
[1:39:06] picture
[1:39:08] there what is it it's the word that's
[1:39:12] what was in his mind at the very
[1:39:14] beginning that's all we are right now is
[1:39:16] the word made flesh it's what he thought
[1:39:20] it's what he spoke and now it's being
[1:39:22] produced in a multimember bride and it's
[1:39:24] just the word it's the thoughts it's the
[1:39:25] attributes it's the expectations it's
[1:39:27] the nature of God being brought into
[1:39:30] reality in Believers lives today it's
[1:39:34] just the fulfilling of his word and when
[1:39:35] that word is fulfilled we get to go and
[1:39:38] that's the final fulfillment and then we
[1:39:40] step into and we've got some things to
[1:39:41] do we've got a marriage supper of the
[1:39:43] lamb and then we've got a millennium and
[1:39:44] these different things but really once
[1:39:46] we're out of here it's done there's no
[1:39:48] stopping us at that point but it's just
[1:39:50] the word the word the word and see we
[1:39:53] can put Christ back at the beginning and
[1:39:55] then we can say he came into flesh but
[1:39:57] if he was the word and we're a part of
[1:39:58] it then the word that was back there has
[1:39:59] to come in flesh today and that's all
[1:40:02] that you have in the Holy Ghost is the
[1:40:03] word becoming flesh and it's there to
[1:40:05] produce that inside of our Lives amen
[1:40:08] it's so
[1:40:11] simple we make it so complicated I think
[1:40:13] so many
[1:40:15] times but we sing that song let your
[1:40:17] word be born that's what the holy
[1:40:19] spirit's doing is it's producing the
[1:40:21] word inside of us and making making
[1:40:23] Christ live all over again amen God
[1:40:25] bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:40:29] Father Lord if we could only receive the
[1:40:32] Simplicity Lord of your revealing
[1:40:36] today Lord if we could humble ourselves
[1:40:38] to get ourselves out of the way Lord and
[1:40:41] yet have faith rise up so that we could
[1:40:44] recognize who's living inside of us lord
[1:40:47] lord it's so often a push and a pull at
[1:40:49] the same time Lord that we'd not get so
[1:40:51] caught up in the goodness of God that
[1:40:53] that's in US Lord that we forget that
[1:40:55] there's a battle that's going on Lord
[1:40:58] and that we've got to keep it under
[1:40:59] subjection day by day but Lord we have
[1:41:02] indwelling God inside of us this evening
[1:41:04] Lord each one that's received your
[1:41:06] spirit Lord and I know Lord your word
[1:41:09] declares there's a greater unveiling of
[1:41:11] God yet to happen Lord and it's
[1:41:13] happening in your bride in this age Lord
[1:41:16] and I pray you help us to be an accurate
[1:41:18] reflection Lord not just in word only
[1:41:21] Lord but above all in our lives Lord let
[1:41:23] our words be seasoned with grace and
[1:41:26] mercy Lord May our nature reflect the
[1:41:29] call of the Bride that says come come
[1:41:32] partake freely while there's yet
