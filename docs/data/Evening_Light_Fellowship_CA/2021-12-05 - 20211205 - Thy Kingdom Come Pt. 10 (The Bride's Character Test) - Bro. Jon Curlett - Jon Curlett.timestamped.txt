[41:52] and then god bless you if you turn your
[41:53] scriptures to genesis chapter 2 this
[41:55] morning
[41:57] genesis chapter 2 immense nice to have a
[41:59] full church here seems like everybody's
[42:01] back that was sick almost
[42:03] got brother chad back came in sister
[42:05] rebecca back in the kids
[42:07] and then brother vaishal's back and then
[42:09] it's good to have good to have everyone
[42:11] here as brother matt said
[42:13] when one's gone we miss him amen amen
[42:16] brother ellie's not here this morning
[42:17] praying god's grace to him
[42:19] sister elise i think is out as well
[42:21] sister priscilla perhaps
[42:23] but uh trusting god will be with them
[42:25] amen
[42:27] amen genesis 2 verse 18 says in the lord
[42:30] god said
[42:32] it is not good that the man should be
[42:34] alone i will make him and help meet
[42:37] for him amen may god bless his word you
[42:39] may be seated this morning
[42:41] and then we want to continue our series
[42:42] and that kingdom come and we want to
[42:44] take a title of the bride's character
[42:47] test amen and we're starting to
[42:48] transition now this will be the the
[42:50] first service where we kind of start to
[42:52] focus on the sisters especially
[42:55] amen and so we want to start with this
[42:57] this uh this title of the bride's
[42:59] character test amen now when we were
[43:02] focused on the men we showed that when
[43:03] god pulled back from humanity he put man
[43:06] into the position of authority amen he
[43:08] made the man the head over marriage in
[43:10] the marriage he made the the the men the
[43:12] head over the women
[43:13] and men don't that doesn't mean that any
[43:15] man is head over any women by any means
[43:17] a man a man is if he's unmarried is head
[43:19] of no one except himself and if he's in
[43:21] the church and he's given authority then
[43:23] he has spiritual authority over people
[43:25] but he absolutely is not the head over
[43:27] every woman i mean i remember we were in
[43:29] one place and a man tried to tell my
[43:31] wife what to do and she said you'll have
[43:34] to talk to my husband about that he said
[43:35] you need to listen to me because i'm a
[43:37] man and she said i absolutely do not i
[43:39] need to listen to my husband amen so
[43:41] there's a limit to a man's folk to
[43:43] immense a man's ministry a man's
[43:45] authority if we could put it that way
[43:46] and that is to his own household and
[43:48] then if he is put in a position of
[43:49] authority in the church then he has
[43:50] spiritual authority but he still doesn't
[43:52] have physical authority over a woman
[43:54] amen and we see on the on the flip side
[43:57] of that then is that a woman can never
[43:58] take spiritual authority over a man
[44:00] there's no position anywhere in the
[44:02] scripture where you will see a woman
[44:03] take a spiritual authority over men
[44:05] you'll see women that are prophetesses
[44:07] but that is not a position of spiritual
[44:08] authority it's a position of being a
[44:10] microphone for god and she has to say
[44:11] thus saith the lord but she does not
[44:13] preach she does not teach she just is a
[44:15] microphone for the lord amen so we see
[44:17] no place where a woman takes spiritual
[44:19] authority and if we want to type it to
[44:21] the bride in christ we never take
[44:22] authority over christ do we amen the
[44:25] easy thing for our sisters to do is say
[44:27] if we wouldn't do it to christ then
[44:28] we're not supposed to do it in this life
[44:30] does it because you are the bride type
[44:32] if we don't do it to god then we're not
[44:34] supposed to do it to other people as
[44:35] well amen that's that's the the easy way
[44:37] for our sisters to see that so a woman
[44:39] is never to be an authority unless she's
[44:41] under authority herself and then under
[44:43] that authority some authority is then
[44:45] given to her for a certain space or a
[44:47] certain part of the family or finances
[44:49] or whatever it might be she is given
[44:51] authority but she does not take
[44:52] authority to herself of her own accord
[44:55] amen now we see life isn't perfect we
[44:57] see broken marriages i come from a
[44:58] broken home where my mom was forced to
[45:01] step into the roles of a man in terms of
[45:02] a provider and a caretaker in these
[45:04] different things and you have to do it
[45:06] out of necessity but it's not something
[45:08] you take under yourself and there's
[45:09] always a price to pay man there's a
[45:11] price to pay for her there's a price for
[45:13] us to pay his kids and that's not in
[45:15] god's perfect will but we're in a fallen
[45:17] world and so we see we get into
[45:18] situations and things where we have to
[45:20] do things that maybe we wouldn't have we
[45:22] wouldn't do if things were in their
[45:23] perfect order amen but we're in an
[45:25] imperfect world we're in a fallen world
[45:27] with fallen people and so there are
[45:29] things that we have to deal with that
[45:30] are maybe a little less than than what
[45:32] god would want us to do but life brings
[45:34] us those situations at times amen
[45:36] but when we start talking about
[45:37] authority and we talk about somebody
[45:39] that that is that is is in authority
[45:41] over another person a lot of times we
[45:43] see this picture painted and you'll
[45:45] certainly see it in the media these days
[45:46] with the focus on cults and these things
[45:48] where they paint a picture of a
[45:49] christian woman that is oppressed i
[45:52] meant she is suppressed she's down
[45:53] trodden she shackled the perfect men
[45:55] she's under fallen leadership and even
[45:58] they are abused amen and i'm not saying
[45:59] those things don't happen by any means
[46:01] they do and we don't want to minimize
[46:03] that but we know that that is not the
[46:05] position that they were intended to
[46:06] occupy is to be under that sort of of a
[46:09] ministry or of a man by any means amen
[46:12] the position and and and the grace of a
[46:14] woman under
[46:16] the body of christ is one of glory it's
[46:18] one of beauty it's one of purity
[46:20] dedication and holiness amen and that's
[46:22] the picture that i want to paint for our
[46:24] sisters as we we go through this amen
[46:26] it's our human nature to dwell on the
[46:28] negative amen on the difficulties on the
[46:30] trials that we face but as we go through
[46:32] here as we start to preach for our
[46:34] sister's sake amen i want a picture of
[46:35] what god sees that you're going to be by
[46:38] foreknowledge and by predestination amen
[46:40] about where he wants you to be by his
[46:42] word amen and how that looks in the life
[46:45] you're living today amen we want to
[46:47] apply the word so we can get word
[46:48] results amen if we're real believers we
[46:50] want our lives to line up with the word
[46:52] and not just line up with it up in our
[46:54] heads but we want to line up in the way
[46:56] we live our lives day by day
[46:58] amen
[47:00] amen so we want to go back to the
[47:01] beginning to see where we are and then
[47:03] because we don't so often what we can
[47:06] look back is is where we were and where
[47:08] we're going but we want to really find
[47:09] out where we are and how we got here
[47:11] because if we can see how that happened
[47:13] then we can see how satan's going to
[47:14] keep trying to affect our lives today
[47:16] because satan is always coming at us
[47:18] from the same way he might change the
[47:19] way it looks but he's got the same thing
[47:21] and he's trying to separate us from one
[47:22] thing and that's the word of god amen so
[47:24] if we take it back to genesis 2 and
[47:26] there was the opening scripture we
[47:28] read and it says in the lord god said
[47:30] it's not good that man should be alone i
[47:33] will make him and help meet for him now
[47:35] i want to remind you i've said it before
[47:37] that this is not a help mate amen it's
[47:39] misquoted so often but this is a help
[47:42] meet and that means it is a helper a
[47:44] companion that is suited specifically to
[47:47] the man amen it's not a slave it's not a
[47:49] servant it's not something that answers
[47:51] to the man this is an equal partner
[47:53] under the perfect situation that they
[47:55] had in eden amen this is a compliment to
[47:58] the men if we could put it that way amen
[48:00] and the driving reason why god created
[48:02] women is that he says it's not good for
[48:04] man to be alone amen and that was an
[48:06] echo of the desire of god's heart was
[48:08] that he looked at himself and said i
[48:10] don't want to be alone i don't like
[48:11] being alone i have great power i have
[48:13] great authority but i'm looking for a
[48:15] relationship i'm looking for family i'm
[48:17] looking for intimacy and i don't have
[48:18] that with the angels they're created to
[48:20] serve the angels were created for one
[48:22] thing and that was to serve but he says
[48:24] i'm looking for something else and that
[48:26] that desire was echoed in the man and so
[48:28] god's seen what's in that man he says
[48:30] it's not good for man to be alone just
[48:31] as it's not good for me to be alone so
[48:33] what he's doing is he's bringing out the
[48:35] desire of that of that man's inward
[48:37] heart amen
[48:39] so in the in a perfect world in eden we
[48:40] had a woman that was created to
[48:42] complement a man now that doesn't mean
[48:44] to say nice things about a man now don't
[48:46] let that stop your sisters from saying
[48:48] nice things about your man but it to
[48:50] compliment means to complete to bring to
[48:53] perfection and to enhance or improve so
[48:56] this was something that was going to
[48:58] make man's life better it was going to
[49:00] make creation better it was going to
[49:01] make their life on earth better by
[49:03] bringing this out of the man amen we
[49:06] talked about compatibility last service
[49:07] remember and we said there's only one
[49:09] thing that makes you compatible with the
[49:11] body of christ and that's the holy
[49:12] spirit because by one spirit we're
[49:14] baptized into this body amen and we
[49:16] looked at eden originally and you see
[49:18] the man and the wife and the wife the
[49:20] men and the woman are perfectly
[49:21] compatible they're in harmony they're in
[49:23] one accord there's no rancor there's no
[49:25] argument there's no fear there's no
[49:27] distrust or anything why
[49:29] because they come from the same source
[49:31] don't they as we continue in verse 21 it
[49:33] says in the lord god caused a deep sleep
[49:35] to fall upon adam and he slept and he
[49:38] took one of his ribs and closed up the
[49:40] flesh there instead thereof and the rib
[49:43] which the lord god had taken from man
[49:45] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[49:47] man
[49:48] and adam said this is now bone of my
[49:51] bones and flesh of my flesh and she
[49:53] shall be called woman because she was
[49:55] taken out of the man
[49:57] therefore shall a man leave his mother
[50:00] and his father and shall cleave unto his
[50:02] wife and they shall be one flesh now i
[50:04] love how what it's saying here because
[50:06] the scripture is telling us men it says
[50:07] your wife is worth leaving mom and dad
[50:10] right life is better married than single
[50:13] right life is better than getting then
[50:16] staying in your your basement or your
[50:17] room and mom cooks all of your meals and
[50:20] you have everything made for you and you
[50:21] have lots of money and lots of toys and
[50:22] lots of this and lots of that it says no
[50:24] no there's a reason to leave and it's
[50:26] because that wife is going to make your
[50:28] life better amen when you get the second
[50:30] half of you then life is better right
[50:33] now that's the opposite of what the
[50:34] world is trying to paint today isn't it
[50:36] right there's there's a focus on
[50:37] singleness today there's a focus on
[50:39] taking the family out of the picture and
[50:40] doing what trying to build the economy
[50:42] trying to make more money for us trying
[50:43] to get us out of this big tax debt that
[50:46] we're in right amen but in a perfect
[50:48] world you're the two are one and he says
[50:50] that's where you want to be is with the
[50:53] with the other part that makes you one
[50:54] that fulfills you that completes you
[50:56] that brings you to perfection amen
[50:59] it says and they were both naked the man
[51:02] and his wife and they were not ashamed
[51:04] now what a contrast that is to today
[51:07] amen where today they know they're naked
[51:10] and they're still not ashamed amen we've
[51:12] come to the place where right is wrong
[51:13] and wrong is right black is is white and
[51:15] white is black amen we've come to the
[51:17] place where we've complete completely
[51:19] switched the way things god said they
[51:21] were supposed to be and what's right and
[51:22] what's not amen
[51:24] now as i said before as we set this
[51:26] proper foundation for the sisters the
[51:28] men and the women were created co-equal
[51:30] here under perfection there is no
[51:32] differentiation of authority between the
[51:34] man and the woman amen that's where they
[51:37] were but we know that the woman sinned
[51:39] and by listening to the serpent what did
[51:41] she do
[51:42] she considered an opinion that was
[51:44] contrary to the word
[51:46] that was the start where she stopped and
[51:47] listened and we've read the quotes many
[51:49] times and brother braham says don't stop
[51:50] and listen right don't have the
[51:52] conversation in the first place don't
[51:54] open the door to the one that's giving
[51:56] you something contrary to the word as
[51:58] soon as you identify it as contrary to
[52:00] the word close the door say we're not
[52:02] even having this conversation but
[52:04] somehow he got an opening with eve
[52:06] didn't he and so they started to talk
[52:07] this over and fellowship over time and
[52:10] what happened was he changed her mind
[52:11] amen and over time that consideration
[52:14] she gave him turned into unbelief and
[52:16] then she took matters into her own hands
[52:18] and we know what the original sim was
[52:19] amen and when she did that she dropped
[52:21] herself out of that position of co-equal
[52:24] god judged her for it and he says you
[52:25] are no longer co-equal because you're
[52:27] the one that sinned amen now i want you
[52:30] to grasp that what i just said does not
[52:32] make her lesser amen she dropped out of
[52:35] her position of co-equal authority but
[52:37] that dog did not make her lesser it did
[52:40] not make her less than a man and it did
[52:41] not make her less in the eyes of god we
[52:43] see that nowhere in scripture all he
[52:45] said was you're no longer under the same
[52:47] authority right now you're under a
[52:49] different authority and the man is going
[52:50] to be the head of you amen
[52:52] she lost her position and in being
[52:54] deceived and doing what god told her not
[52:56] to do she effectively took herself out
[52:58] of a position of authority but it didn't
[53:00] make her lesser and that's often the
[53:02] problem we see is that we make the women
[53:04] a lesser thing because of the original
[53:06] sin and god didn't say you're lesser he
[53:08] just said you're not in the same
[53:10] position you were that's what we've got
[53:11] to remember as men is that our sisters
[53:13] are not lesser but they are in a
[53:15] different position and that's all there
[53:16] is to it and it's not of our doing it's
[53:18] of god's doing if we can put it that way
[53:20] amen
[53:21] why because adam wasn't deceived and
[53:23] paul says it clearly in first timothy 2
[53:25] he says and adam was not deceived but
[53:28] the woman being deceived was in the
[53:30] transgression so this is why she was out
[53:32] was because she was deceived he fooled
[53:34] her now adam didn't do what he did with
[53:37] eve out of deception because he did it
[53:40] out of love amen brother brown we've
[53:42] read the quotes where he says and
[53:43] quickly adam took her to himself so that
[53:46] what god wouldn't destroy her because
[53:48] now she was a part of him in every way
[53:50] possibly man he put his seat inside of
[53:52] her because god wouldn't just wouldn't
[53:54] destroy that righteous seed amen he took
[53:56] himself to her and he saved her and it
[53:58] was that savior attribute that god
[54:01] recognized when he put that man in
[54:03] authority over the woman
[54:04] amen and we see this in the scripture
[54:06] because adam took the place not because
[54:09] he was better but because he loved her
[54:11] and god was understanding that he would
[54:13] be considerate and loving and everything
[54:14] else if he was willing to give up
[54:16] eternal life
[54:17] then why wouldn't he be a right leader
[54:19] for everything else i mean if you're
[54:20] willing to give up the one thing that
[54:22] makes you a god then he's trusting that
[54:24] the man is going to continue down that
[54:25] path and the way he treats that wife the
[54:27] way he treats that woman is going to be
[54:29] reflected in sacrificial love for the
[54:31] rest of his life amen so we see that the
[54:33] driving factor here for the man being
[54:35] put in authority was because man showed
[54:37] the character of love and salvation to
[54:39] that woman and then he put himself with
[54:41] her out of love and god says i'm going
[54:42] to trust you to be in authority by love
[54:45] for the rest of time amen
[54:48] it says in in romans 5 14 it says
[54:50] nevertheless death reigned from adam to
[54:52] moses even over them who had not sinned
[54:55] after the similitude of adam's
[54:56] transgression who is the figure of him
[54:59] that was to come in the amplified it
[55:01] says adam was a type or a prefigure of
[55:04] the one who was to come why adam was
[55:06] christ-like in his transgression because
[55:08] what he took on sin for the sake of his
[55:11] bride amen now adam was imperfect when
[55:14] he did it because he broke the word of
[55:15] god when he did it but he broke the word
[55:17] with his eyes wide open for the sake of
[55:19] his wife christ on the other hand was
[55:21] perfect and he had no sin he did not
[55:24] break the word but rather he came and he
[55:26] took our sin on him and in doing so he
[55:28] paid the price so adam was a type and
[55:30] christ was the fulfillment of perfect
[55:32] love if we could put it that way amen
[55:34] adam was the type christ was a
[55:36] fulfillment now
[55:38] we're not going to get into marriage for
[55:39] quite some time i don't know if we ever
[55:41] will in this in the series i don't feel
[55:42] that's necessarily where we want to go
[55:44] but we see here that the christ-like man
[55:46] is motivated by love in all things when
[55:48] it comes to authority amen that love is
[55:50] supposed to be the motivating factor
[55:52] it's not for selfishness it's not for
[55:54] things that we want but rather it's for
[55:56] the benefit of those that are under our
[55:57] authority and we covered this when we
[55:59] spoke about the men was that when you do
[56:01] things it is supposed to be for the
[56:02] benefit of those that are beneath you
[56:04] not for the benefit just of yourself
[56:06] amen
[56:07] so what we have to ask ourselves what
[56:09] does our motive mean if we're in
[56:10] authority and we're doing something if
[56:12] we're insisting on something or if we're
[56:13] holding the line is it out of love or is
[56:15] it out of selfish motivation is it to
[56:17] make our life easier or is it to make
[56:19] those that are under our authority lives
[56:21] better amen we want to question our
[56:23] motives every time so when we what we
[56:25] have here is somebody that's trying to
[56:27] what help and support the woman so the
[56:29] question is how are you supporting her
[56:31] and how are you helping her because a
[56:33] lot of times we have a certain idea of
[56:34] what we believe the woman wants and
[56:36] needs and we should by the word of god
[56:38] but so often what we're ignoring is what
[56:40] the woman says she needs because that's
[56:42] not something that we are ready to
[56:43] supply just yet and that's really the
[56:45] character test for men especially in
[56:46] marriage is will you supply what your
[56:48] wife has needs of even if you don't
[56:50] think that's necessary amen i can speak
[56:52] from my own marriage that my wife was
[56:54] asking for things for emotional
[56:56] connection these different things and i
[56:58] wasn't willing to give it to her because
[56:59] i didn't need it the way she needed it
[57:01] but my role is to provide for what she
[57:03] needs not to provide just for what i
[57:04] have need of so i had to do what i had
[57:06] to humble myself i had to bring myself
[57:08] to a place where i would meet her
[57:10] emotional needs and something that was
[57:11] very uncomfortable for me to do most of
[57:13] you know i'm not a particularly
[57:14] emotional people unless a person unless
[57:16] i'm in church or unless my kids are
[57:17] being born that's where my two emotions
[57:19] are right
[57:20] and so when it when a wife is asking you
[57:22] to connect emotionally and you're not
[57:24] particularly emotional what's that
[57:25] that's a real stretch isn't it right and
[57:27] so there's going to be things in every
[57:29] marriage and every man's life is where
[57:30] you're going to have to stretch because
[57:32] your wife is saying i need this and
[57:33] you're saying but i don't have it so
[57:35] where are you going to go get it you got
[57:36] to go to the one that provides amen you
[57:38] got to go to jehovah gyra you've got to
[57:40] humble yourself and say well just
[57:41] because it's not natural to me doesn't
[57:43] mean i'm not going to do it she has
[57:45] needs and i'm supposed to be supplying
[57:47] those things amen
[57:49] when we go back to genesis now we want
[57:51] to see where god places the woman in
[57:52] general after the fall
[57:54] he says now unto the woman he said i
[57:56] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[57:59] conception in sorrow thou shalt bring
[58:01] forth children and thy desire shall be
[58:03] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[58:06] thee now remember the command was given
[58:08] be fruitful and multiply and what eve
[58:10] was trying to do was be fruitful and
[58:12] multiply
[58:13] right
[58:14] she was trying to be fruitful multiply
[58:15] she was trying to bring forth life and
[58:18] satan convinced her that if he did it
[58:19] she did it his way then she would get
[58:21] that and in addition to that she'd have
[58:23] other things she would be like god when
[58:25] she did it amen and so because of that
[58:28] god judges childbirth for the lady for
[58:31] the woman right and this is a reflection
[58:33] of what he's judging her based on what
[58:35] she did he's making what she did now
[58:37] very difficult he's making it a pain for
[58:40] her to go through what she was trying to
[58:42] bring forth he's greatly multiplied it
[58:45] from what it would have been otherwise
[58:46] right and what he's doing is he's
[58:48] compounded now the judgment by giving
[58:50] her a natural desire a craving for
[58:52] intimacy with that husband so he's put
[58:55] the woman between a rock and a hard
[58:56] place because he's given her a desire
[58:58] for physical intimacy and then the fruit
[59:00] of that physical intimacy is going to
[59:02] cause her pain and hardship right and
[59:03] not just from the birth but she's gonna
[59:05] have 18 years probably a pain in
[59:06] hardship raising those kids with a
[59:08] husband so what he's done is he's made
[59:10] he's given her a desire to do what she
[59:12] did that she shouldn't have done and
[59:13] then he's get he's judged it by causing
[59:15] that to have a painful outcome amen it's
[59:17] an eternal reminder of what the original
[59:19] sin was it's amazing to me that people
[59:21] think the original sin was eating some
[59:23] sort of fruit off of an apple because we
[59:24] never see a judgment on a tree do we
[59:27] we we see a judgment on the things that
[59:29] cause the problem in the first place
[59:30] amen and so we don't see it on the mouth
[59:33] we don't see it on the hand do we we see
[59:35] it in the place where the original sin
[59:37] was amen
[59:38] so god judged that part of the original
[59:40] sin but her greatest loss was not the
[59:42] pain
[59:43] it was what that lost position of
[59:45] co-equal authority with the man now
[59:47] she's put under headship that is flawed
[59:49] and that is the greatest struggle and
[59:50] the greatest trial and that is the
[59:51] greatest character test of our sisters
[59:53] today is to sit under flawed authority
[59:56] because every man in here ought to be
[59:57] able to raise his hands and say i am
[59:59] flawed authority amen whether it's in
[1:00:02] ministry whether it's in fatherhood
[1:00:03] whether it's in husbandhood whether it's
[1:00:05] it's a position in the church we are
[1:00:07] flawed men amen and if the women haven't
[1:00:09] haven't grasped that by now they're
[1:00:11] going to grasp it very shortly amen we
[1:00:13] are flawed men and that they're called
[1:00:14] to be under our headship and as long as
[1:00:17] we are here in these bodies of sin that
[1:00:19] never changes a woman never takes
[1:00:21] authority over a man
[1:00:22] amen that's where god has put it amen
[1:00:26] now for a woman that's single because
[1:00:29] we're talking about a man and a wife
[1:00:30] right a woman that is single she has no
[1:00:32] husband and so god has still put her
[1:00:34] under headship and that's her father
[1:00:35] right and we see in numbers 30 that a
[1:00:37] young woman as long as she is under the
[1:00:39] roof of her father she's under the
[1:00:40] headship of her father and he has
[1:00:42] covenant authority now i want you to
[1:00:44] grasp what authority means because
[1:00:46] authority doesn't mean you get to force
[1:00:48] authority means you can break that's
[1:00:49] what we see in the scriptures i can't
[1:00:51] force my wife to do anything my wife
[1:00:53] still has has free will right i can't
[1:00:55] force my wife to have kids i can't force
[1:00:57] my wife to stay home i can't force my
[1:00:59] wife to clean the house or do any of
[1:01:01] these things she has to do it of her own
[1:01:03] free will amen we're not brute beasts we
[1:01:04] don't go around with a whip cracking it
[1:01:06] and saying you must do this you must do
[1:01:08] that that's not what authority under
[1:01:09] god's
[1:01:10] word is supposed to look like right
[1:01:12] we're supposed to lead and we're
[1:01:13] supposed to support and we're supposed
[1:01:15] to serve that's what authority is really
[1:01:17] supposed to look like in its greatest
[1:01:18] elements right so we don't force them
[1:01:21] but what we can do is we can break amen
[1:01:23] and what we can do is we can break what
[1:01:24] they commit to do as soon as we hear it
[1:01:26] and so we saw that a father has covenant
[1:01:28] authority for his daughter so if she
[1:01:31] said i vowed to god to to
[1:01:33] go around the world seven times
[1:01:35] preaching the gospel then he could say
[1:01:36] no i'm going to break that vow god's not
[1:01:39] going to hold you to that because as
[1:01:40] soon as i hear i'm telling you that's
[1:01:41] not the right thing to do and i'm
[1:01:43] putting a stop to it or it can be
[1:01:44] something as simple as where she's going
[1:01:47] or or she's committed to a missions trip
[1:01:49] or or she's going to fast for 40 days or
[1:01:52] whatever it could be whatever that that
[1:01:53] daughter committed to then as soon as he
[1:01:55] heard it he could break it and that's
[1:01:56] the same authority that a husband has
[1:01:58] for his wife as if she says i prayed
[1:02:00] about it and i feel led to do this and
[1:02:01] he says sorry i can't allow you to do
[1:02:03] that because it's going to impact the
[1:02:04] family too much it's going to impact me
[1:02:05] too much it's going to cause problems
[1:02:08] it's not going to have the benefit
[1:02:09] you're looking for sorry i'm going to
[1:02:10] put a stop to it husbands have covenant
[1:02:12] authority and fathers have covenant
[1:02:13] authority over young women that are
[1:02:15] still under their house amen
[1:02:18] so again we don't force them to do
[1:02:20] things but we can keep you from doing
[1:02:22] something that's really the authority
[1:02:23] that a man has amen but i want to come
[1:02:25] back to this idea of child bearing
[1:02:27] because in the old testament especially
[1:02:28] the focus was on that be fruitful and
[1:02:30] multiply command and god gave it to adam
[1:02:33] god gave it to noah god gave it to
[1:02:34] abraham god gave to jacob and then by
[1:02:36] moses god gave it all the way to the
[1:02:38] children of israel in leviticus and
[1:02:40] after that we don't hear anything it was
[1:02:41] a command given and god says look i've
[1:02:43] told the children of israel to do this i
[1:02:45] don't ever have to mention again and we
[1:02:46] never see it ever again in scripture he
[1:02:49] gives it in leviticus moses gives it to
[1:02:50] the children of israel and after that we
[1:02:53] don't see it at all we don't see it in
[1:02:54] the new testament ever and all we see
[1:02:56] then is israel was trying to grow into
[1:02:57] the great nation that god told them to
[1:02:59] be right when they were looking for a
[1:03:00] natural kingdom a natural land and they
[1:03:02] were going to be a great people with
[1:03:04] with the as the sands of the sea and
[1:03:06] these different things right all they
[1:03:07] were focused on was having children so
[1:03:09] that's what the women were focused on
[1:03:11] back then they were focused on bringing
[1:03:13] the fulfillment of the promise of god to
[1:03:15] the israelites and so a woman's role
[1:03:17] back then was purely to get married and
[1:03:20] have children
[1:03:22] the value of a woman was determined by
[1:03:24] is she married and once she's married
[1:03:25] does she have children
[1:03:27] and it was really that simple that's all
[1:03:29] they looked to the women for was
[1:03:31] marriage and children
[1:03:33] right
[1:03:33] now we look around in in the church
[1:03:36] today and we see that obviously that's
[1:03:38] not the only thing we value our sisters
[1:03:39] for right but in those days that's all
[1:03:42] they were seeking and we see it in sarah
[1:03:43] we see it in rachel and we see it within
[1:03:45] hannah and these women are struggling
[1:03:47] and striving to have children right and
[1:03:50] if they didn't have it it was what a
[1:03:51] reproach to them it was a slight against
[1:03:53] their character and their value in
[1:03:55] society and even to their own husbands
[1:03:57] if they couldn't bring forth life
[1:03:58] because that was the overarching
[1:04:00] commandment was we've got to be a great
[1:04:02] nation and we can only do it if the
[1:04:03] women bring forth children right
[1:04:05] so the goal was have a lot of kids and
[1:04:08] again that's really difficult on the
[1:04:09] women because that's the thing that god
[1:04:11] cursed was he says it's going to be very
[1:04:13] painful for you to have children so
[1:04:15] they've got a desire to do it but it's
[1:04:16] bringing pain in their lives and so your
[1:04:18] whole value is based on something that's
[1:04:21] painful to you
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:23] i will tell you this sisters nothing's
[1:04:25] changed today
[1:04:26] your value is going to be based on
[1:04:27] something that's very painful for you to
[1:04:29] do it's going to be difficult for you to
[1:04:30] do us men have a load to carry and you
[1:04:33] women have a load to carry and it is not
[1:04:34] an easy thing to do amen
[1:04:37] so we see here what the woman is
[1:04:39] supposed to do she's supposed to take
[1:04:40] what the man gives her and she's
[1:04:42] supposed to magnify it glorify it and
[1:04:44] manifest it amen so what she takes is
[1:04:46] she takes a seed and she turns it into
[1:04:48] what a beautiful baby right she takes
[1:04:51] one thing and she turns it into
[1:04:53] something much bigger and greater and
[1:04:54] then it grows and it manifests she takes
[1:04:56] the potential she takes the vision she
[1:04:58] takes the dna of that man and she turns
[1:05:01] it into a
[1:05:02] into a reality right she's a magnifier
[1:05:04] she's a glorifier she takes something
[1:05:06] and she makes it into something better
[1:05:07] than it was when it was given and then
[1:05:09] even if you look into proverbs 31 in
[1:05:11] these different areas we see the woman
[1:05:13] is both gifted and positioned to take
[1:05:15] something that is raw something that is
[1:05:17] relatively unimproved and she turns it
[1:05:19] into something amazing amen you bring in
[1:05:21] the groceries men and then she turns it
[1:05:23] into what a wonderful meal you bring in
[1:05:25] cloth and she turns it into clothing you
[1:05:27] bring in this and she turns it into that
[1:05:29] you buy a house and she turns it into a
[1:05:30] home right all of these things what
[1:05:33] she's doing she's taking what you give
[1:05:34] her and she makes it into something
[1:05:36] better and then she's a glorifier she is
[1:05:38] something that is supposed to be the
[1:05:40] glory the scripture says a woman is the
[1:05:42] glory of her husband amen that's so when
[1:05:44] we look at the women when we look at our
[1:05:46] wives they are supposed to be a glory
[1:05:48] for us and if something's a glory that's
[1:05:50] not something we're going to be putting
[1:05:51] down is it it's something we're supposed
[1:05:53] to be elevating something that we're
[1:05:54] supposed to be encouraging something
[1:05:55] that we're supposed to be growing
[1:05:57] something that we're supposed to be
[1:05:58] putting a lot of effort into because
[1:05:59] that's our glory amen our glory is not
[1:06:01] ourselves our glory is our wife right
[1:06:04] so there's a lot that that goes into
[1:06:06] this amen but in the in the nation of
[1:06:08] israel that woman was absolutely outside
[1:06:10] of any spiritual authority the only
[1:06:12] place we'll ever see a woman with
[1:06:13] anything spiritual in that sense is the
[1:06:15] prophetesses and you'll see it with
[1:06:16] miriam and you'll you'll see it with
[1:06:18] with the judges and whatnot but even
[1:06:20] then we'll get deeper into that later
[1:06:21] they're still under headship they're
[1:06:23] still under headship when they do it
[1:06:24] they don't get to run around and do
[1:06:25] whatever they want amen a prophet or a
[1:06:27] prophetess is one thing and they're a
[1:06:29] microphone they say thus saith the lord
[1:06:31] and then they speak and then they don't
[1:06:32] say anything else of their own amen
[1:06:34] they're just a microphone amen a
[1:06:37] commentary i read on this had this to
[1:06:38] say it said in ancient judaism the woman
[1:06:41] only had rights in the home and even
[1:06:44] that was very limited
[1:06:47] the man had authority over his wife and
[1:06:49] daughters establishing their activities
[1:06:51] and their relationships women were
[1:06:53] passed from the control of her father to
[1:06:55] the control of her husband with little
[1:06:57] or no say in the matter they were sold
[1:07:00] for a dow resettlement usually when they
[1:07:02] came of age now like i said you can look
[1:07:04] around the church today and you can see
[1:07:05] that things have definitely changed amen
[1:07:08] i'm not selling my daughter to anybody
[1:07:10] because they couldn't afford her amen
[1:07:12] but what we don't pass women around like
[1:07:14] cattle right we don't just move them
[1:07:16] from our house to somebody else's house
[1:07:18] and then they have spiritual roles in
[1:07:20] the church we have sisters that play we
[1:07:22] have sisters that sing we have sisters
[1:07:24] that worship amen we have sisters that
[1:07:26] teach in the sunday school and these
[1:07:27] different things they have a role in the
[1:07:29] church amen and they have what not
[1:07:31] spiritual authority but they have
[1:07:33] spiritual impact in a way they were
[1:07:34] never allowed to in the old testament
[1:07:36] right the women were separated from the
[1:07:38] men for most of most of the time in the
[1:07:40] in the old temples they had a women's
[1:07:41] car court and then they had
[1:07:43] the the inner and then they had the
[1:07:44] outer court so the women were between
[1:07:46] the inner court outer court and the
[1:07:48] inner court they were better than a
[1:07:49] gentile and a money lender but they
[1:07:51] weren't necessarily the same as a man
[1:07:52] that that's where they were societally
[1:07:54] that had nothing to do with god we don't
[1:07:56] see a woman's cord in the original
[1:07:58] temple did you know that it was never
[1:07:59] there but under men they took it and
[1:08:01] they ran with it and they made it way
[1:08:03] worse than it had to be right god never
[1:08:05] intended to separate them that way but
[1:08:07] men did that for whatever reason right
[1:08:10] but we don't see it in the original
[1:08:11] temple so what happened was they took
[1:08:13] the word of god and then they started
[1:08:14] adding men's doctrine to it to cause
[1:08:16] what a separation and so for 4 000 years
[1:08:19] women are defined by are they married
[1:08:21] and do they have children and if they
[1:08:23] didn't they were not valued
[1:08:25] right and it was a slight to them it was
[1:08:26] a slight to their family it was a
[1:08:28] reproach to their family if they weren't
[1:08:29] married and having babies for four
[1:08:31] thousand years and then christ comes
[1:08:33] along and he starts walking around and
[1:08:35] he fulfills the law and he pays the
[1:08:36] penalty of the sin that he caused in the
[1:08:39] in the garden of eden and all of a
[1:08:40] sudden we see things change like i said
[1:08:42] now he commissions us and he says what
[1:08:44] go you into all the world and preach the
[1:08:46] gospel and all of a sudden we're here to
[1:08:47] bring forth spiritual children not just
[1:08:50] natural children now don't think for a
[1:08:52] second that this lets the sisters off
[1:08:54] the hook there is still a primary role
[1:08:56] for a woman and it is still in the house
[1:08:58] and the scripture fulfills it and paul
[1:09:00] and paul confirms it to us as well and
[1:09:02] the prophet said it as well okay you
[1:09:04] still have a primary place but you are
[1:09:05] not limited only to that and what
[1:09:08] happens is jesus comes and all of a
[1:09:09] sudden gets what he's doing he's
[1:09:11] inviting women out of their traditional
[1:09:12] roles right he's got women that are
[1:09:14] following him around from town to town
[1:09:16] and city to city and what are they they
[1:09:18] are spiritually minded women that are
[1:09:20] what supporting the role of that
[1:09:21] outreach because guess what there are
[1:09:23] things that women can talk to women
[1:09:24] about that men can't easily talk to men
[1:09:27] about and as we start to go and we start
[1:09:28] to seek people and we start to try and
[1:09:30] bring souls into the kingdom now women
[1:09:32] can have a role in in mentorship and in
[1:09:34] fellowship and even in witness
[1:09:37] right they can never join the priesthood
[1:09:38] that's never going to open up for them
[1:09:39] you can never have a woman ministering
[1:09:41] teaching admonishing men it's never
[1:09:44] going to happen it's never in the
[1:09:45] scripture but they can still have a role
[1:09:47] in bringing souls into the kingdom amen
[1:09:49] and we've got sisters in this very
[1:09:50] church that have witnessed the people
[1:09:52] and brought them to church and have done
[1:09:54] what
[1:09:55] they've furthered the gospel in the
[1:09:56] kingdom of god amen there's a place that
[1:09:58] you're allowed to take it's just not
[1:10:00] over men but you still have a place now
[1:10:02] in the kingdom and jesus does this and
[1:10:03] jesus goes to women he talks to women
[1:10:06] and he has women following him in his
[1:10:07] ministry and that was never allowed
[1:10:09] before that was never a part there so we
[1:10:11] see what an expansion of the role of
[1:10:13] women to allow them to have a spiritual
[1:10:15] impact in the church
[1:10:17] and that's where we want you to see
[1:10:18] today is that you are no longer just
[1:10:19] valued for being married and having kids
[1:10:22] right there is something else you can do
[1:10:24] and like i said we see it here we see a
[1:10:25] tremendous gift in our in our sisters
[1:10:27] here for singing how many singers how
[1:10:29] many great singers do we have in this
[1:10:30] church that are gifted not just to sing
[1:10:32] in the pews but to come up and what be
[1:10:34] anointed by the holy spirit to what
[1:10:36] caused the cause the presence of god to
[1:10:38] come ever closer to us amen
[1:10:40] it's something that we value and we
[1:10:42] cherish right can you imagine the old
[1:10:44] days we'd have missed that right we
[1:10:46] wouldn't have had that why because
[1:10:47] christ has come and he's what he's put
[1:10:49] aside the old covenant now we're under a
[1:10:51] new covenant and there's a freedom that
[1:10:52] allows them to be a part of things that
[1:10:54] they weren't before amen
[1:11:03] now
[1:11:04] the perfect way and the perfect example
[1:11:06] is still through marriage
[1:11:07] that's what he started with he started
[1:11:09] with marriage didn't he started with a
[1:11:10] man and a woman and they were they were
[1:11:12] husband and wife amen so that is the
[1:11:14] perfect way that's the type of christ
[1:11:16] and the bride i mean that's the place
[1:11:18] you're always going to find the perfect
[1:11:19] types and it's the perfect shadow of
[1:11:21] what we are with christ amen so i do
[1:11:23] believe that the perfect example for a
[1:11:25] christian is still to be married right
[1:11:27] but that doesn't mean you have to be
[1:11:29] married to be a christian it doesn't
[1:11:30] mean you have to be married to be a true
[1:11:31] believer for a woman it doesn't mean you
[1:11:33] have to have kids or have a husband to
[1:11:35] be a true believer paul shows us this
[1:11:37] very clearly and we'll start to we're
[1:11:38] going to cover the single sisters and
[1:11:40] these different things as we go through
[1:11:42] amen but marriage will grow you
[1:11:44] strengthen you humble you cause
[1:11:46] character growth in ways that you will
[1:11:47] never get if you're not married because
[1:11:49] why as iron sharpness iron if you're in
[1:11:52] the house with somebody on a regular
[1:11:53] basis their flaws and your flaws it's
[1:11:55] going to bring things to light very
[1:11:57] quickly and god will use that spouse to
[1:11:59] do what sharpen you off and take off
[1:12:01] those rough edges amen because as a man
[1:12:03] you're going to have to humble yourself
[1:12:04] and sacrifice and as a woman you're
[1:12:06] going to have to humble yourself and
[1:12:07] sacrifice amen you both have to give 100
[1:12:10] to marriage right it's not 50 50. it's
[1:12:12] 100 100 and that's how you get the whole
[1:12:14] out of it amen but it's not a
[1:12:16] requirement men and women don't have to
[1:12:18] be married to be what effective in the
[1:12:20] kingdom of heaven now right again we'll
[1:12:23] see it i'm giving you a very broad
[1:12:24] picture i'm giving you a lot of
[1:12:25] generalities sisters and brothers alike
[1:12:27] so you'll see where we're going to go
[1:12:29] here because what happens so often is
[1:12:31] that when a brother says i'm going to
[1:12:33] preach to the man it's all great but
[1:12:34] when he says i'm going to preach to the
[1:12:35] sisters now we start to get tightened up
[1:12:37] and is he going to pin us down for the
[1:12:38] way we dress and married or not married
[1:12:40] and working and not working and
[1:12:41] educating and not educating and saying
[1:12:43] this and doing that and they get
[1:12:44] tightened up i'm not here to to hammer
[1:12:47] you down i'm not here to push you down
[1:12:49] i'm here to show you where your freedom
[1:12:51] is and where your limit is amen and then
[1:12:53] you can self-judge yourself as to
[1:12:55] whether you want to do that or whether
[1:12:56] you don't want to do it but we're going
[1:12:58] to paint a picture for what the word
[1:12:59] says you can do for what the word says
[1:13:01] it will bring you to and the beauty and
[1:13:03] the holiness it'll bring you to and then
[1:13:05] you get to make a decision do i want it
[1:13:07] or do i not want it or maybe the bigger
[1:13:08] question is do i have it or do i not
[1:13:10] have it amen when i was preaching to the
[1:13:12] men it was what we're looking at
[1:13:14] ourselves we're self-examining right
[1:13:16] that's what we're supposed to do before
[1:13:17] we go to communion remember scripture
[1:13:19] says examine yourselves why judge
[1:13:21] yourselves so that you're not judged
[1:13:23] right so that the word judges you and
[1:13:24] you can be dealing with that rather than
[1:13:26] having other people coming up to you and
[1:13:27] trying to tell you what to do amen let
[1:13:29] the word judge you amen i'm not here to
[1:13:31] judge anybody amen but the thing with
[1:13:33] being single is that most people can't
[1:13:35] handle it and again we'll get into this
[1:13:37] a bit later and paul says i wish
[1:13:38] everyone was like i was
[1:13:40] right he was single at that point
[1:13:42] but he says most people can't handle it
[1:13:44] jesus said it they came to him when they
[1:13:46] were talking about divorce laws and and
[1:13:48] he says you can't do that you can only
[1:13:49] do it for one reason they said well then
[1:13:51] it's better for better for us not to be
[1:13:52] married he says yes but he says most
[1:13:54] people can't handle it he says some are
[1:13:56] eunuch and and they're made that way but
[1:13:58] most aren't and they need to be married
[1:14:00] to what get past the lust and the
[1:14:02] desires of the flesh right if you look
[1:14:04] at a man it's going to be a physical
[1:14:05] it's going to be physical desires that
[1:14:07] are probably going to tip him over the
[1:14:08] edge but he can go into a life of
[1:14:10] hedonism where he he wants to have toys
[1:14:12] and he wants to have big vacations and
[1:14:13] he's always wants to be out having fun
[1:14:15] in these different things and then for a
[1:14:16] sister it's going to be a struggle for
[1:14:18] headship every single time amen because
[1:14:20] you're going to think because i'm not
[1:14:21] under headship then i get to do this and
[1:14:23] this and this and it'll take you
[1:14:24] completely off the word as well right
[1:14:26] the man is supposed to be sacrificing
[1:14:27] and so when he's single the the the the
[1:14:30] inclination is not to sacrifice it's to
[1:14:32] live for yourself and for the sing the
[1:14:34] sisters they're supposed to be under
[1:14:35] authority and when you're single the the
[1:14:37] the the pressure is to what not be under
[1:14:39] authority right that's the two struggles
[1:14:41] you're going to face is the man's going
[1:14:42] to be selfish and the woman's going to
[1:14:43] be headstrong
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] but our title today is what the bride's
[1:14:49] character test we spend a lot of time
[1:14:51] last service speaking on what character
[1:14:54] now i want to read the quote for this
[1:14:55] because we all know it but i want to set
[1:14:57] a foundation here
[1:15:00] and a stage for
[1:15:01] our sisters now this is talking about
[1:15:03] the bride of christ and brothers we're
[1:15:04] talking about women but the type is the
[1:15:07] bride so anything we say about women it
[1:15:09] applies to us as as we are the part of
[1:15:11] the bride of christ amen so let's not
[1:15:12] just look at our sisters let's look at
[1:15:14] our own lives and say how does this
[1:15:15] apply to me in my walk with god amen and
[1:15:18] am i submitting myself and am i doing
[1:15:20] the same thing that i expect the sisters
[1:15:21] to do or my wife to do or or whoever it
[1:15:23] might be amen now brother brown says
[1:15:25] this he says and if children then heirs
[1:15:27] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:15:30] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:15:32] may also be glorified together for i
[1:15:35] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:15:37] present time are not worthy to be
[1:15:38] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:15:40] revealed in us he says unless we suffer
[1:15:42] with him we cannot reign with him you
[1:15:45] have to suffer to reign the reason for
[1:15:47] this is that character simply is never
[1:15:49] made without suffering character is a
[1:15:52] victory not a gift so you can't go to
[1:15:54] god and say god i want character he
[1:15:56] won't give it
[1:15:58] it's not something that he deposits into
[1:15:59] your life it's not something he deposits
[1:16:01] into your person into your being but if
[1:16:03] you want character what does he do is he
[1:16:04] puts you in a battle and he proves
[1:16:06] what's in you and then you can see do i
[1:16:08] have what i thought i had or do i not
[1:16:10] have what i have and then you say lord
[1:16:11] put in me what i need and he's going to
[1:16:13] put it there and then he's going to run
[1:16:14] you through a trial again and a battle
[1:16:16] again until you have what you say that
[1:16:17] you needed amen he says a man without
[1:16:20] character can't reign because power
[1:16:22] apart from character is satanic but
[1:16:25] power with characters fit to rule and
[1:16:28] since he wants us to share even his
[1:16:29] throne on the same basis that he
[1:16:32] overcame and is set down in his father's
[1:16:34] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:16:37] with him
[1:16:38] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:16:40] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:16:43] to the tremendous glory that will be
[1:16:45] revealed in us in us not to us in us
[1:16:50] when he comes
[1:16:51] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[1:16:53] who are willing
[1:16:55] willing not forced not driven not
[1:16:57] hammered into it but those that are
[1:16:59] willing to enter his kingdom through
[1:17:03] what
[1:17:04] much
[1:17:05] tribulation amen our tribulation is now
[1:17:08] brothers and sisters this is where we
[1:17:09] are judged this is where we are purified
[1:17:11] this is where we have what the the proof
[1:17:14] that we are who we say we are they're
[1:17:16] going to go through a tribulation after
[1:17:17] we leave our tribulation is now and it
[1:17:19] is to do one thing and that is produce
[1:17:21] that character that godly character in
[1:17:23] our lives
[1:17:24] he said thinking not strange concerning
[1:17:26] the fiery trials that are to try you
[1:17:29] that is what peter said is it strange
[1:17:31] that god wants us to develop a
[1:17:32] christ-like character that comes through
[1:17:35] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:17:39] we are all tried and chastened as sons
[1:17:42] not one but goes through that everyone
[1:17:44] goes through it and the church that is
[1:17:46] not suffering and that is not being
[1:17:48] tried hasn't got it
[1:17:51] wow
[1:17:52] the church that is not suffering and is
[1:17:55] not being tried hasn't got it now when
[1:17:57] he says the church he's talking about
[1:17:58] the called out one so let's take it down
[1:17:59] to your life if you are not suffering
[1:18:03] then you don't have it if you didn't
[1:18:05] suffer to get what you think you have
[1:18:06] then you don't have what you think you
[1:18:08] have if i could put it that way amen you
[1:18:09] have to have suffered to have what you
[1:18:11] think you have
[1:18:13] he says what it isn't of god hebrews 12
[1:18:15] 6 and 8 says for whom the lord loveth he
[1:18:17] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[1:18:20] he receiveth but if ye be without
[1:18:22] chastisement whereof all our partakers
[1:18:24] then are ye bastards and not sons
[1:18:27] and then so we've got a character
[1:18:28] struggle here and then there's got to be
[1:18:30] a victory and so men face a character
[1:18:33] struggle and women face a character
[1:18:34] struggle now what is the character
[1:18:36] struggle for us men it is to show our
[1:18:38] character through love right that is the
[1:18:41] christ-like nature we're supposed to do
[1:18:43] is rule by love not by a an iron fist
[1:18:46] not by a whip not by a club right not by
[1:18:49] harsh words but to rule by love and that
[1:18:51] is the ultimate reflection of christ is
[1:18:54] love god is love amen for god so loved
[1:18:57] the world that he gave his life
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:00] in ephesians 2 25 25 it says husbands
[1:19:04] love your wives even as christ also
[1:19:06] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:19:08] amen men do a lot of things by nature
[1:19:10] but loving is rarely one of them
[1:19:12] physically we're great at it every other
[1:19:14] way no right why because we are by
[1:19:17] nature selfish
[1:19:19] and so the struggle for us is to love in
[1:19:21] an unselfish way amen and so what we're
[1:19:24] generally practical and our inclination
[1:19:25] is to do things that we can touch and
[1:19:27] see and and we can we can we can have in
[1:19:30] front of us and whatnot but love goes
[1:19:32] way beyond what we can put in front the
[1:19:34] home we can put over our wives head the
[1:19:36] car we can put in the driveway the
[1:19:37] clothes on our back and these different
[1:19:38] things but this is an all-fulfilling
[1:19:40] love that we're supposed to be doing we
[1:19:42] can't do it all we never can that's why
[1:19:43] they need god remember we're supposed to
[1:19:45] be doing our best to fulfill every need
[1:19:47] that we can possibly fulfill of theirs
[1:19:49] amen but the great test for us is to
[1:19:50] love as christ did amen and so what the
[1:19:53] great test for us is when we do
[1:19:55] is when we realize that the women that
[1:19:57] are under our authority are occasionally
[1:19:59] stubborn
[1:20:00] temperamental disobedient illogical
[1:20:03] overly emotional or any other
[1:20:05] characteristic that your wife might be
[1:20:07] able to exhibit that's when the test of
[1:20:09] your character is it's not when she's
[1:20:10] making your supper and your breakfast
[1:20:12] and your lunch exactly the way you want
[1:20:13] it the house is sparkling clean she
[1:20:15] looks beautiful every day her breath
[1:20:17] never smells right and her attitude is
[1:20:20] phenomenal that is not the test of our
[1:20:22] character brothers our test of character
[1:20:24] to love is when she is unlovable
[1:20:26] because guess what there's going to be a
[1:20:27] day where she is unlovable to you
[1:20:30] and you're still going to have to love
[1:20:31] her where what it's not that you don't
[1:20:33] love her so you don't feel like loving
[1:20:35] her right and then can any married men
[1:20:37] be honest and say there was a day where
[1:20:39] i didn't feel like loving my wife
[1:20:41] and the question is what did we do
[1:20:43] did we act out of that or did we just
[1:20:44] step right over it and say no i have a
[1:20:47] christ-like nature i'm going to love you
[1:20:48] regardless right that's the test for us
[1:20:50] is to love the unlovable not that
[1:20:53] they're unlovable all the time but
[1:20:54] sometimes they're unlovable amen but for
[1:20:57] the women however they have a different
[1:20:58] test of character don't they it's in the
[1:21:01] same scripture it says wives submit
[1:21:03] yourselves unto your own husbands even
[1:21:05] as unto the lord now that as unto the
[1:21:08] lord means as if he was god
[1:21:11] submit yourselves to your husbands as if
[1:21:13] he was god and in the same way that you
[1:21:16] submit yourself to god
[1:21:18] now that is a massive test of your
[1:21:20] character because what
[1:21:23] whether you realize it or not yet there
[1:21:26] is going to be a time where what you'll
[1:21:28] realize that the men that you are under
[1:21:30] authority to are imperfect selfish lazy
[1:21:33] or have any other number of character
[1:21:35] flaws that this men are able to exhibit
[1:21:37] right so your test is submit is to
[1:21:40] submit when the info the authority is
[1:21:42] imperfect right when the man is clearly
[1:21:44] doing something wrong as far as you can
[1:21:46] tell and yet you will still submit to it
[1:21:48] that is a test of your character is when
[1:21:50] you'll submit when you really don't want
[1:21:52] to submit
[1:21:53] you may have the the best reason you may
[1:21:55] even have a word reason
[1:21:57] right but you don't get to force him any
[1:21:59] more than he gets to force you and so
[1:22:00] that is the test of your character now
[1:22:02] remember we said last service this word
[1:22:04] wives is not wives
[1:22:06] it is women
[1:22:08] and it is a woman of any age whether a
[1:22:10] virgin married or a widow so this is not
[1:22:13] only to the women to the wives this is
[1:22:15] for women every believing woman she is
[1:22:17] to submit to her husband now this
[1:22:20] doesn't mean that uh obviously if you're
[1:22:22] single you don't have a a literal
[1:22:23] husband here but you do have headships
[1:22:25] so it's either your father but in one
[1:22:27] thing is certain we are all subject to
[1:22:29] the word amen so you have to submit
[1:22:30] yourself to the word regardless and it
[1:22:33] is to do it as unto the lord as if you
[1:22:34] were doing it to the lord that word
[1:22:36] submit it means to submit to one's
[1:22:39] control
[1:22:41] to yield to one's ammunition
[1:22:43] now control is one thing but admonition
[1:22:45] what do we do when your husband or your
[1:22:47] father is saying you really shouldn't do
[1:22:49] this or i wish you would do this that's
[1:22:51] an admonition
[1:22:53] amen that's trying to get you to do
[1:22:55] something without forcing you to do it
[1:22:57] or to yield to one's admission or advice
[1:23:00] or to obey
[1:23:02] but catch the second one this is says a
[1:23:04] voluntary attitude of giving in
[1:23:07] voluntary
[1:23:09] now that's what we have to do with the
[1:23:10] word amen all of us men and women alike
[1:23:12] is what we have to voluntarily give
[1:23:15] ourselves give up our rights and then we
[1:23:17] are no longer we are no longer free
[1:23:20] right i am not free we are prisoners as
[1:23:22] paul said i'm a prisoner to christ amen
[1:23:24] i'm a love prisoner to christ but that
[1:23:26] is by volunteering it i gave it up of my
[1:23:29] own free will and so for the sisters it
[1:23:32] is a voluntary attitude of giving in
[1:23:35] of cooperating of assuming
[1:23:38] responsibility and carrying a burden
[1:23:41] i will tell you this i'm not a woman but
[1:23:43] i know what my own leadership is like
[1:23:45] and for my wife it's a burden to be
[1:23:47] under my leadership at times
[1:23:49] it is also a burden to carry the
[1:23:51] responsibilities that i've given her
[1:23:53] under that authority amen this is not an
[1:23:56] easy walk
[1:23:58] this is something that's going to bring
[1:23:59] out character in you amen he said that
[1:24:02] character is a victory so victory
[1:24:04] implies what a battle
[1:24:06] hardship struggle and an enemy right
[1:24:08] this is not a walk in the park we are
[1:24:10] not full of character having easy lives
[1:24:13] amen this is going to be a struggle this
[1:24:15] is going to be a trial for the men and
[1:24:16] for the women alike amen
[1:24:19] because why we're all inherently flawed
[1:24:21] scripture says we have all sinned and
[1:24:22] come short of the glory of god so we've
[1:24:24] got flawed men in leadership and we've
[1:24:26] got flawed women in submission and that
[1:24:28] means that they're sometimes not going
[1:24:29] to be in submission and that means that
[1:24:30] the men are sometimes not going to be in
[1:24:31] very good authority and yet through it
[1:24:33] all character is developed amen
[1:24:36] amen so what we all are flawed we all
[1:24:39] have to have the new birth we all have
[1:24:41] to have the indwelling of the holy
[1:24:42] spirit and this is always a work of
[1:24:44] grace we've covered it time and time
[1:24:45] again our pastor his three favorite
[1:24:47] words are grace grace grace aren't they
[1:24:49] right why because we need to have it and
[1:24:51] our our every action or every attitude
[1:24:54] ought to be tempered with one thing and
[1:24:55] that is grace for the other person amen
[1:24:58] for their failures for their
[1:24:59] shortcomings and for their flaws amen
[1:25:00] scripture says freely you have received
[1:25:02] freely give
[1:25:03] amen
[1:25:04] now so the sisters the test of their
[1:25:07] characters to be under authority and to
[1:25:09] be in submission now contrast that
[1:25:11] against what the world is saying today
[1:25:13] what is the world's message today to our
[1:25:14] sisters to our women free yourselves
[1:25:17] right
[1:25:18] do whatever the men are doing you're
[1:25:20] better than men you can do what men do
[1:25:21] you can do what men do better you don't
[1:25:23] need a man you don't need to be married
[1:25:25] you don't need to have kids you
[1:25:26] definitely don't need to be under
[1:25:27] authority to everyone they're saying to
[1:25:29] the women you're equal with men guess
[1:25:31] what the word never said otherwise
[1:25:33] right it's a false argument the word
[1:25:35] never said that the women were any less
[1:25:38] right never said that they were less
[1:25:39] than a man it just said they're under
[1:25:40] authority to the men but they make up
[1:25:42] this false argument to the sisters to
[1:25:44] say well you're less than a man no i'm
[1:25:46] just in a different role amen
[1:25:49] amen i'm just in a different role and if
[1:25:51] i can step into that role then that's
[1:25:53] where god's gonna bless me amen what are
[1:25:55] they saying we'll watch your kids for
[1:25:57] ten dollars a day sisters so you can do
[1:25:59] what go make more money so you can have
[1:26:01] what a great life and a ruined marriage
[1:26:03] they don't tell you the real marriage
[1:26:05] part do they
[1:26:06] but they'll tell you that we can take
[1:26:07] care of your kids for ten dollars a day
[1:26:08] what kind of what kind of support do you
[1:26:10] think your kids are getting for ten
[1:26:11] dollars a day even with government
[1:26:13] subsidies 25 30 bucks a day you think
[1:26:15] they're going to do what you can do
[1:26:16] sisters there's no way there's no way on
[1:26:18] god's green earth that they're going to
[1:26:19] be able to take care of your kids for
[1:26:21] thirty dollars away the way you can if
[1:26:22] you commit your life to them amen look
[1:26:25] at hollywood i had to look these up
[1:26:27] don't judge me
[1:26:29] hollywood has had a burst
[1:26:31] of female superheroes in the last five
[1:26:33] to ten years right and what are they
[1:26:35] doing is they're starting to take out
[1:26:36] the men and they're starting to insert
[1:26:37] the women
[1:26:38] so we have superwoman we have wonder
[1:26:40] woman we have black widow we have
[1:26:43] captain marvel we have bat woman we have
[1:26:45] the wasp we have catwoman and we have
[1:26:47] elektra
[1:26:48] amen and at the same time do you know
[1:26:50] what they're doing to the male
[1:26:51] superheroes
[1:26:52] they're making them lesser and lesser
[1:26:54] they're emasculating them they're making
[1:26:55] them into the bad guys the latest
[1:26:57] captain america is bisexual
[1:27:00] okay that was supposed to be the symbol
[1:27:02] of
[1:27:02] american awesomeness
[1:27:05] and they've turned him into a separate
[1:27:06] simpering environmentalist
[1:27:08] right that's where he is now that's
[1:27:10] where they put the men and what are they
[1:27:12] doing they're putting the women in the
[1:27:13] position of men and they're putting the
[1:27:14] men in the position of women and what
[1:27:16] they're really trying to do is make one
[1:27:17] big lump where there's neither men or
[1:27:18] women it's just humanity and it's a
[1:27:20] hundred percent against the word of god
[1:27:23] every single bit of it amen
[1:27:24] what is it sisters they're aiming at you
[1:27:28] okay who did satan pick
[1:27:30] go back to the very beginning who did he
[1:27:32] pick we don't know whether he tried adam
[1:27:35] the scripture's silent on it maybe he
[1:27:37] went at him and said has god not said
[1:27:40] and adam said god has said now get out
[1:27:42] of here.
[1:27:43] all we know is he's how he saw no
[1:27:45] opening with adam but there was
[1:27:47] something about that conversation that
[1:27:48] first conversation with the woman where
[1:27:50] she did not reject him outright and from
[1:27:52] there he stuck with it and he stuck with
[1:27:54] it and what he's been sticking with it
[1:27:56] ever since if he can get the woman to
[1:27:58] fall then he can get the entire society
[1:28:00] to fall with her okay sisters he's not
[1:28:02] aiming for the men only he has gun him
[1:28:04] for the sisters because he's had his
[1:28:06] greatest success with the sister in the
[1:28:07] first place amen amen listen if we can
[1:28:10] see it in hollywood that's satan's
[1:28:12] throne right satan's throne is hollywood
[1:28:14] if you can see it happening there then
[1:28:16] you know that he's trying to do it in
[1:28:17] our sisters everywhere else amen that
[1:28:19] his guns are aimed at you amen
[1:28:22] listen to what brother branham said he
[1:28:24] says that's what he did in the beginning
[1:28:26] and he certainly has made a target out
[1:28:28] of you sisters he does that just to
[1:28:30] because he knows what he can do he can
[1:28:33] deceive a woman a thousand times quicker
[1:28:35] than a man
[1:28:36] i know that hurts your feelings but
[1:28:38] that's the truth
[1:28:40] this isn't brother john amen i'm not
[1:28:42] here to hammer you i'm reading what the
[1:28:44] prophet said
[1:28:45] okay that's exactly that's what he done
[1:28:47] the garden of eden okay this is the
[1:28:48] prophet pointing us back to the original
[1:28:50] sin he says now she was honest and she
[1:28:54] was sincere
[1:28:56] and we'd say great and then he says but
[1:28:59] she was deceived honest and sincere
[1:29:02] right great attributes great
[1:29:04] characteristics we should all be honest
[1:29:05] and sincere but remember brother brown
[1:29:07] says you can be sincerely wrong right
[1:29:10] sincerity does not guarantee rightness
[1:29:12] he says adam was not deceived the bible
[1:29:14] said he wasn't deceived but she was
[1:29:16] deceived so he can deceive her
[1:29:19] amen like i said this is not brother
[1:29:21] john saying it this is what the prophet
[1:29:22] said and this is what he's bringing to
[1:29:24] our sisters amen so the question is this
[1:29:27] in your sincerity and in your honesty
[1:29:30] just because you are sincere and honest
[1:29:31] does not make you right so if you're
[1:29:33] sitting here and you're insisting on
[1:29:34] your rightness how did you get to your
[1:29:36] rightness was it by sitting there and
[1:29:38] mulling it over and dwelling on it and
[1:29:39] dwelling on it until you convinced
[1:29:41] yourself or did you pull it through the
[1:29:42] word from genesis to revelation because
[1:29:44] that's where our rightness has to come
[1:29:46] is through the word not by sitting and
[1:29:47] mulling it over amen if there's one
[1:29:50] thing that sisters are very good at it's
[1:29:51] mulling things over in their head amen
[1:29:54] they can take things and they can turn
[1:29:55] it into a very jumble ball very quickly
[1:29:57] because why that's their nature that's
[1:29:59] the way they're built as they can take
[1:30:00] hey listen folks they're magnifiers
[1:30:03] they're glorifiers and guess what if you
[1:30:04] have the wrong thing they'll still
[1:30:06] magnify it
[1:30:07] right brothers if you don't like what
[1:30:08] you're getting change what you're giving
[1:30:10] right because you've got a bad attitude
[1:30:12] you're a poor provider you're a poor
[1:30:14] spiritual authority in the home father
[1:30:16] husband whatever it is if you're poor in
[1:30:18] that she's going to magnify the poorness
[1:30:20] but if you're great in it then she's
[1:30:22] going to magnify the greatness amen so
[1:30:24] if there's something coming in that's
[1:30:25] poor she'll magnify it into something
[1:30:27] that's really bad right but if she can
[1:30:29] take it back to the word if she can take
[1:30:32] it back to her husband if she can take
[1:30:33] it back to her father now maybe he'll
[1:30:34] maybe steer clear and help her to find
[1:30:36] her way through it right
[1:30:40] listen us men have to do the same thing
[1:30:42] it's not specific to women only just
[1:30:44] because say you know he says he can fool
[1:30:45] a woman a thousand times quicker doesn't
[1:30:47] mean he can't fool a man
[1:30:48] amen i've been fooled many times amen
[1:30:50] this is this is not like he can't fool a
[1:30:52] man therefore go to a man by any means
[1:30:55] by any means let's not put the man in
[1:30:56] that position they can't be fooled but
[1:30:58] what he has an easier time with the
[1:30:59] sisters that's what he's saying here he
[1:31:02] said but the woman being deceived was in
[1:31:04] the transgression see now listen to this
[1:31:06] eve actually thought she was right
[1:31:11] you say how
[1:31:12] he literally said the opposite of the
[1:31:14] word but eve thought she was right when
[1:31:17] she accepted it
[1:31:19] that's how far he got her was he got her
[1:31:21] 100 percent opposite he turned a yes he
[1:31:24] turned a no into a yes and she thought
[1:31:25] that's right okay that took time that
[1:31:28] didn't happen in a day okay that took
[1:31:30] time that took influence that cut that
[1:31:32] that took fellowship with the wrong
[1:31:35] person
[1:31:37] right and he got her to believe the
[1:31:39] opposite of what the word said the
[1:31:40] literal opposite
[1:31:42] that's how strong it is eve actually
[1:31:44] thought she was right but satan deceived
[1:31:47] her but he didn't deceive adam he knew
[1:31:49] it was wrong but because of the love for
[1:31:51] his wife he represented himself with sin
[1:31:54] and was condemned by the same and cast
[1:31:57] out of the garden of eden
[1:32:00] i can speak by experience and say this
[1:32:03] many times in dealing with sisters
[1:32:06] they're trying to do the wrong thing for
[1:32:07] the right reason
[1:32:09] they have all the right motives they
[1:32:11] have all the right objectives but
[1:32:13] they're trying to do the wrong thing but
[1:32:14] they have the right reasons for it and
[1:32:16] that's what makes them think that
[1:32:17] they're right
[1:32:18] but the reason doesn't matter if what
[1:32:19] you're doing is wrong amen
[1:32:22] i had something i was dealing with
[1:32:24] recently with my wife and she was just
[1:32:25] saying you know
[1:32:27] no you really need to do this and i said
[1:32:28] no
[1:32:29] you're i agree with where you're coming
[1:32:31] from but it says it's still the wrong
[1:32:33] thing to do you can't do it that way you
[1:32:34] can't and and you have to hold firm and
[1:32:36] that's very difficult for us men
[1:32:37] sometimes because you can see where
[1:32:39] they're coming from you can see where
[1:32:40] their heart is you can see where their
[1:32:41] desire is you can see where their motive
[1:32:43] is and it's from a great place but that
[1:32:45] doesn't make it right a right motive
[1:32:46] does not make us right amen it's got to
[1:32:49] be right with the word right and then
[1:32:51] you've got to have the right motive on
[1:32:52] the flip side us brothers okay let's
[1:32:54] flip it around we can do the right thing
[1:32:56] with the wrong motive and we're still
[1:32:57] just wrong right just because it was
[1:32:59] right by the word but we did it the
[1:33:01] wrong way that still makes it wrong did
[1:33:02] you know that it has to be wrought by
[1:33:04] the word with the right motive and the
[1:33:05] right objective that's a challenge for
[1:33:07] us all isn't it to be right in across
[1:33:09] the spectrum amen amen
[1:33:13] now i'm speaking to message believers
[1:33:15] right now because this is a real
[1:33:16] challenge to our sisters when i put
[1:33:17] these quotes up i cringe reading them i
[1:33:20] cringe putting them in my notes and i
[1:33:22] cringe speaking them over the pulpit
[1:33:24] because it doesn't feel good it doesn't
[1:33:26] sound good it doesn't look good it's a
[1:33:27] challenge to a sister to read this and
[1:33:29] say that's me
[1:33:31] right
[1:33:32] that's the way i'm built
[1:33:34] is that i can be deceived more easily
[1:33:36] than a man
[1:33:37] but if you can recognize it you can keep
[1:33:39] it in check
[1:33:40] right and you cannot get caught up on
[1:33:42] that high horse of what
[1:33:43] self-righteousness that comes along so
[1:33:45] easily and you can humble yourself and
[1:33:46] say lord
[1:33:48] give me somebody to help me either
[1:33:50] confirm it to me not another sister
[1:33:53] not another sister
[1:33:55] no go to your head right you've got a
[1:33:58] father you've got a husband or you got a
[1:34:00] pastor
[1:34:01] right
[1:34:02] you got somebody you can go to to run it
[1:34:04] by them and say am i right brother am i
[1:34:06] right husband
[1:34:07] am i right dad
[1:34:09] that's what we need to do run it by your
[1:34:11] headship scripture says if any woman has
[1:34:13] a question from what happens in the
[1:34:14] service go ask her husband right
[1:34:17] if you're single go ask your father
[1:34:19] right and say dad did i read that right
[1:34:20] did i hear that right is that right is
[1:34:22] that really what we believe is that
[1:34:23] really what he said no take it back to
[1:34:25] your headship
[1:34:26] right
[1:34:28] amen but your test sisters your
[1:34:29] character test is submission and your
[1:34:32] natural inclination is that you're more
[1:34:34] easily deceived
[1:34:36] can you see how that's going to cause
[1:34:37] friction
[1:34:39] right
[1:34:40] you have to submit
[1:34:41] and yet you have a very high opinion of
[1:34:43] what you think
[1:34:44] you think you're right but you're often
[1:34:46] not
[1:34:47] that's your natural inclination that's
[1:34:48] what the prophet's saying here is you've
[1:34:50] got a natural inclination that allows
[1:34:51] you to be more easily deceived than a
[1:34:53] man but you think you're right still
[1:34:55] that's a hard thing to to deal with
[1:34:57] amen especially under flawed leadership
[1:35:00] especially under flawed leadership
[1:35:01] because it magnifies that and you're
[1:35:03] like well he's definitely not right
[1:35:05] and he may not be
[1:35:06] right that's the difficulty here right
[1:35:08] so victory for a woman in terms of
[1:35:10] characters is what submitting even when
[1:35:13] she's convinced she's right
[1:35:15] you've got to the word says you submit
[1:35:17] right
[1:35:19] it doesn't listen submission is not
[1:35:21] based on the qualifications of the man
[1:35:24] it just says submit right now you have
[1:35:26] to do it as unto the lord you don't do
[1:35:27] something that is clearly off the word
[1:35:29] right if your husband's trying to force
[1:35:31] you to go out dancing and drinking or
[1:35:32] something you don't have to do that
[1:35:34] that's clearly off the word
[1:35:35] right
[1:35:36] but in everything else
[1:35:38] if it's not off to work then you do it
[1:35:40] right and it's not whether he's perfect
[1:35:42] or great or amazing or even right you're
[1:35:45] still under authority because what he
[1:35:46] answers to god he answers to god you're
[1:35:49] answering to god through him in that
[1:35:50] sense but it's will you submit and then
[1:35:52] you get let god sort that out and guess
[1:35:54] what us brothers it's no fun when god
[1:35:56] deals with you does it when you're off
[1:35:58] when you're off base
[1:36:00] when you're stepping into a path of your
[1:36:01] own making when you're on your high
[1:36:03] horse
[1:36:05] god knocks us down so quickly sisters he
[1:36:07] knocks us down so quickly
[1:36:09] right and it'll allow you to say i need
[1:36:11] to pray for him
[1:36:13] rather than i need a rant about him
[1:36:15] right i need to dig in my heels right
[1:36:17] because that's the inclination is what
[1:36:18] dig in our heels i don't want to do it i
[1:36:20] don't blame you for not wanting to do it
[1:36:21] many times
[1:36:22] i don't blame you for not wanting to do
[1:36:24] it it's difficult us men are difficult
[1:36:27] right
[1:36:28] but you're called to do it anyways
[1:36:30] he says this also there's nothing that
[1:36:31] can be so easily deceived as a woman now
[1:36:34] the fall proves this statement to be
[1:36:36] true the fall in the beginning she was
[1:36:38] not in the original beginning creation
[1:36:40] she was in adam but not in a female sex
[1:36:42] herself at the beginning she was the
[1:36:44] byproduct made he says now there is
[1:36:45] nothing designed that can deceive
[1:36:48] and be deceived as easy as a woman and
[1:36:50] we see that today because what it is i i
[1:36:52] believe we could say it's a woman's
[1:36:54] world now in the sense that the
[1:36:55] influence is coming from the females far
[1:36:57] more than the men you still have men at
[1:36:59] the highest levels of of economy and
[1:37:01] companies and that it's still very much
[1:37:02] a a male
[1:37:05] dominated
[1:37:06] aside from the commerce side of things
[1:37:08] but from where things are shifting now
[1:37:09] it is heavily female driven and then
[1:37:11] whether it's in hollywood whether it's
[1:37:13] in education we have more women are
[1:37:14] educated than men now
[1:37:16] right we have what a lot more women
[1:37:18] going into the workforce instead of
[1:37:20] going into marriage and you have this
[1:37:22] real shift in hollywood you have it in
[1:37:24] the politics you have it in in commerce
[1:37:26] and these different things in education
[1:37:27] you see the influence of women coming in
[1:37:30] and guess what that's satan's pride
[1:37:33] right he's developing a bride and god's
[1:37:35] developing a bride and so when you look
[1:37:37] at the world you see what satan's bride
[1:37:39] looks like so sisters if you're matching
[1:37:41] up to what the world is teaching guess
[1:37:42] whose bride you're patterning yourself
[1:37:44] after right satan's bride because he's
[1:37:46] preparing his church and what christ is
[1:37:48] preparing his church amen and she's not
[1:37:50] going to line up with the world in any
[1:37:51] way or fashion and then it's just not
[1:37:53] going to happen
[1:37:57] now here's the thing you say that's
[1:37:58] about women that's it okay
[1:38:00] great
[1:38:01] listen
[1:38:02] god has put things on our shoulders that
[1:38:04] he expects us to do and guess what
[1:38:06] compared to god there's nothing that can
[1:38:08] deceive or be as easily deceived as a
[1:38:10] human right
[1:38:12] we talk about the woman being a weaker
[1:38:13] vessel guess what guess what i am right
[1:38:16] here right now
[1:38:17] i'm the weaker vessel
[1:38:19] right where's god god's up there the
[1:38:21] unseen spirit and he's using what me to
[1:38:23] speak to you he's using the weaker
[1:38:25] vessel isn't he right so when we look at
[1:38:27] this listen i can be deceived as easily
[1:38:29] as anybody else i'm not saying that we
[1:38:31] can't right i'm saying that god has
[1:38:32] chosen to use an easily deceived vessel
[1:38:35] men are easily deceived as inhumanity is
[1:38:37] easily deceived and yet he uses humanity
[1:38:39] we are his hands and feet we are his
[1:38:41] voice on this earth amen so again it's
[1:38:43] not that we can't identify it as men
[1:38:45] with what the sisters are going through
[1:38:46] because god chooses to use us and then
[1:38:48] we fail and we fail and we we don't
[1:38:50] submit and we do things our own way and
[1:38:51] we try and take control that's the way
[1:38:53] we get denominations as men trying to
[1:38:55] take control isn't it right so man we
[1:38:57] can identify with this can't we we've
[1:38:59] been deceived we've gone our own way
[1:39:01] we've done our own things we've tried to
[1:39:02] do things in a way that is contrary to
[1:39:04] the word and every time we come back and
[1:39:05] god slaps our hand and brings us back
[1:39:07] and we line up again we try again right
[1:39:10] us man we know a lot about submission if
[1:39:12] we're real believers amen and we know
[1:39:14] what it's like to get off and we know
[1:39:15] what it's like to be brought back on so
[1:39:17] it's not that it's only on you sisters
[1:39:18] amen like i said men are called to love
[1:39:21] the unlovable and women are called to
[1:39:22] submit to the imperfect who's got the
[1:39:24] tougher road
[1:39:26] who's got the tougher road
[1:39:29] i'd say my wife has the tougher road
[1:39:33] i find it easier to love her than i
[1:39:35] think she finds it to to follow me
[1:39:37] because i know my own flaws and then i i
[1:39:39] know my own failures i know the thoughts
[1:39:41] i have right i know the inclinations i
[1:39:43] have and sometimes even when i do the
[1:39:45] right thing i know that inside i don't
[1:39:46] feel the same way that i'm doing i'm
[1:39:48] doing it because i'm forced to do it in
[1:39:50] the sense that i will i refuse to allow
[1:39:52] myself to do something contrary to the
[1:39:54] word but yet often there is a little
[1:39:55] thing in there that says this is really
[1:39:56] not what i'd rather be doing right now
[1:39:58] right
[1:39:59] right for me i i i can commiserate with
[1:40:02] the sisters
[1:40:03] i can say knowing my own flaws i can say
[1:40:06] it must be tough
[1:40:07] it must be tough because here's the
[1:40:09] thing i have to know how to submit to
[1:40:11] christ but my husband is perfect
[1:40:13] nein or nina nina right my husband's
[1:40:15] perfect your husbands aren't perfect
[1:40:18] right
[1:40:19] to me i think that's harder i think our
[1:40:21] sisters have a harder road that's just
[1:40:22] me
[1:40:23] amen that's that's that's that's brother
[1:40:26] john
[1:40:27] it's only an opinion amen
[1:40:29] but you aren't called to submit because
[1:40:31] men are better or greater
[1:40:33] you're just called because that's the
[1:40:34] way god said to do it it's really that
[1:40:36] some simple it's it's really that simple
[1:40:38] but i meant one day women are going to
[1:40:39] be restored to your original position
[1:40:42] amen and guess what the women will the
[1:40:44] men will be shouting hallelujah that day
[1:40:46] just as much as the women are believe me
[1:40:47] because it takes a big load off of our
[1:40:49] shoulders as well and men don't think
[1:40:51] there's not pressure on the men to do
[1:40:52] these things amen it's a difficult life
[1:40:54] to bear that responsibility that to have
[1:40:56] that christ-like nature to try and
[1:40:58] and bring people bring a wife bring a
[1:41:00] family to an eternal destination amen
[1:41:03] it's not an easy thing to do but
[1:41:06] one day we won't have to do it
[1:41:09] and we'll praise the lord together and
[1:41:10] we'll be under one great head that time
[1:41:12] again and then we'll be restored back to
[1:41:14] that eden condition we'll be under one
[1:41:16] man and that's christ our heavenly
[1:41:17] bridegroom right
[1:41:18] but there's only one thing that will put
[1:41:20] a woman back in her place
[1:41:22] and it's the word of god quickened by
[1:41:23] the holy spirit it's the only thing
[1:41:25] that's going to get you there lebron
[1:41:27] says this now i'm going to say something
[1:41:29] national force put israel in her
[1:41:31] homeland national force will put the
[1:41:33] church in the world council of churches
[1:41:36] but the power of god will put the people
[1:41:38] in the bride
[1:41:40] the world forces this way and the world
[1:41:42] forces that way but god forces upwards i
[1:41:46] want to stop there and say god forces
[1:41:47] upwards when when trials and struggles
[1:41:50] hit what do we do do we do this
[1:41:53] or do we do this
[1:41:55] right do we try and do it with national
[1:41:56] no force do we do with physical force or
[1:41:59] do we do it with godly force where we
[1:42:01] say lord this is your way of doing it
[1:42:03] i'm giving it back into your hands amen
[1:42:05] because when we start doing this
[1:42:08] then we block out this
[1:42:09] right god will never intervene as long
[1:42:11] as you're trying to do it on your own
[1:42:13] but what if you can give it back to the
[1:42:15] one who set it up in the first place now
[1:42:17] he's responsible for sorting it out
[1:42:20] he says the spirit of god which is the
[1:42:22] word of god my spirit word is spirit and
[1:42:24] life will put the bride in her place
[1:42:28] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:42:30] the word and then she's in christ will
[1:42:32] put her in her place
[1:42:35] if you can stay in your place he's got
[1:42:37] something to work with
[1:42:38] but if you get out of your place then
[1:42:40] he's got nothing to work with he can't
[1:42:42] respond except to his word and if you
[1:42:44] step out of the word then what's he
[1:42:45] going to respond to nothing right he's
[1:42:47] got to get you back
[1:42:49] he says no national force will do it but
[1:42:51] the national force did drive israel to
[1:42:53] the homeland the national forces of the
[1:42:55] council of churches will drive every
[1:42:57] organization into it but the power of
[1:42:59] god will raise the bride into glory out
[1:43:03] of it
[1:43:04] o people recognize your day as jesus
[1:43:07] warned you the sign of sodom and the
[1:43:09] church's conditions of this day and then
[1:43:12] your sisters want to find your position
[1:43:14] get the holy ghost you'll never find it
[1:43:16] without it you'll never find it without
[1:43:18] it you'll struggle and you'll strive and
[1:43:20] and you'll make your own life miserable
[1:43:21] you'll make your family's life miserable
[1:43:23] your husbands your fathers whatever the
[1:43:24] case may be if you don't have the holy
[1:43:26] ghost there's no way you're going to
[1:43:27] step into this because you've got to
[1:43:28] find rest in a place of imperfect
[1:43:30] authority amen and that's only going to
[1:43:32] come through the indwelling of the holy
[1:43:34] spirit in your life amen and what the
[1:43:36] holy spirit does not give you freedom to
[1:43:38] run around
[1:43:39] the holy spirit gives you freedom to
[1:43:40] submit yourself to the word of god just
[1:43:42] like the man next to you amen it calls
[1:43:45] us in remember we said the universal
[1:43:46] attribute of the believers of the church
[1:43:49] the bride of christ is that they will
[1:43:51] submit themselves to the word they will
[1:43:52] align themselves with the word remember
[1:43:53] we read that quote where brother brown
[1:43:55] says in every revival it causes the
[1:43:58] women
[1:43:59] the church the called out ones
[1:44:00] to what come back to the word to align
[1:44:03] with the word him and that's the same
[1:44:05] thing and the holy ghost has to give you
[1:44:06] a desire to submit the same way it has
[1:44:09] to give a man a desire to rule with love
[1:44:11] right because lots of men want to rule
[1:44:15] not many want to rule with love right
[1:44:17] he's got to give us a desire a change a
[1:44:19] nature change to cause us to want what
[1:44:21] he wants amen now is that easy no it's a
[1:44:24] battle every day isn't it it's a battle
[1:44:25] for us men it's a battle for the women
[1:44:27] and there's nothing about victory that's
[1:44:29] easy like we said before victory implies
[1:44:30] struggle it implies a battle it implies
[1:44:32] hardship that implies an enemy and then
[1:44:34] so you're going to be fighting every day
[1:44:36] to do this sort of thing amen
[1:44:39] he says in women i want you to look in
[1:44:41] the mirror and look what god requires a
[1:44:43] woman to do
[1:44:44] and see in god's mirror not in your
[1:44:46] church mirror now in god's mirror and
[1:44:49] see if you could qualify in your life as
[1:44:51] a spiritual bride of jesus christ
[1:44:54] now that goes for every one of us that's
[1:44:56] not just to the sisters is look at our
[1:44:57] lives and say does that qualify as the
[1:44:59] bride of christ but remember as we
[1:45:00] preach that service you the women the
[1:45:02] sisters are the type of the bride right
[1:45:04] they're the reflection when when we look
[1:45:06] at them on the street they're a
[1:45:08] reflection of the condition of the
[1:45:09] church i think it's amazing i'm sure the
[1:45:11] men can identify this you're driving
[1:45:13] around and mostly you're guarding your
[1:45:14] eyes but you see a woman walking with a
[1:45:15] skirt and long hair what do you say whoa
[1:45:19] immediately
[1:45:20] without ever talking to that you say
[1:45:23] that's potentially a christian
[1:45:25] doesn't mean she is a christian but
[1:45:27] potentially that's a christian and it
[1:45:28] quickens and we're like hey
[1:45:30] that could be one of us and then we look
[1:45:32] and we see do they go to our church
[1:45:33] maybe it's a pentecostal maybe it's just
[1:45:35] a worldly woman that has realized that
[1:45:38] that long hair and those dresses are
[1:45:40] absolutely gorgeous right you never know
[1:45:42] but as soon as we see it we know it
[1:45:44] don't we you sisters you don't ever have
[1:45:46] to speak a word you don't ever have to
[1:45:48] speak a word just by walking around
[1:45:50] dress the way you do with the attitudes
[1:45:52] you have the hair the way it is it is an
[1:45:54] instant
[1:45:55] recognition that there's something
[1:45:57] different about you and it's amazing
[1:45:58] like i said like we'll be walking
[1:46:00] through i never go to the mall but you
[1:46:02] walk through the mall or you walk
[1:46:03] through something or you're driving down
[1:46:04] the street and as soon as you see it you
[1:46:06] say who's that who's that is that
[1:46:08] someone we know
[1:46:10] because why there's a need
[1:46:11] there's just something that quickens
[1:46:13] inside you and says there's something
[1:46:14] about them right they're different
[1:46:17] what do you measure up ministers he says
[1:46:19] think the same do you cut corners here
[1:46:21] to save somebody's feelings over yonder
[1:46:24] it's a tough one as well doesn't it
[1:46:26] guess what we're all flawed
[1:46:28] i see some of the flaws brother gerald
[1:46:29] sees some of the flaws we all see flaws
[1:46:31] if i get up here and i preach against
[1:46:33] the flaw that you have
[1:46:34] do you know how that makes me feel
[1:46:36] if i know about it it makes me feel
[1:46:38] horrible i'm not preaching at you i'm
[1:46:40] preaching the word but that's not an
[1:46:41] easy thing to do you sit in that office
[1:46:44] you go home you beat yourself up did
[1:46:45] they take it the right way i didn't
[1:46:47] realize that i didn't i forgot that they
[1:46:49] even had that and then
[1:46:51] you know who brings it to your mind
[1:46:52] later it's not god brings it to your
[1:46:53] mind later satan to try and get you to
[1:46:54] what to back off the next time you're
[1:46:56] going to say something right what to
[1:46:57] make you gun shy right listen a minister
[1:47:01] has to sit up here and he has to move as
[1:47:02] the spirit of god moves him and then
[1:47:04] it's up to the people to take it or
[1:47:05] leave it but if he is silent when god
[1:47:07] tells him to speak
[1:47:09] he answers for it and it's not a pretty
[1:47:11] picture amen it's a hard thing to do
[1:47:13] he says would you do this if they'll put
[1:47:15] you out of the church if you're feeling
[1:47:17] that way my dear brother let me warn you
[1:47:18] in the name of jesus christ flee from
[1:47:20] that right now and lady if you can't
[1:47:23] measure up to the qualification of a
[1:47:24] christian not as a nominal christian
[1:47:28] what's a nominal christian
[1:47:29] outward signs
[1:47:31] right you know what's inside of you i
[1:47:33] know what's inside of me
[1:47:35] you know what's helped keep me humble
[1:47:37] with the small humility that i have
[1:47:41] is i know what's inside of me
[1:47:43] and when you're honest and when you're
[1:47:45] praying before god
[1:47:47] right when you go
[1:47:48] and you're dealing with a situation or
[1:47:50] something like that guess what if you go
[1:47:52] in with an honest heart and say
[1:47:54] what am i contributing to this
[1:47:56] usually you don't end up praying too
[1:47:57] much for that person you usually end up
[1:47:59] praying for yourself because you see
[1:48:00] where you're contributing and where
[1:48:02] you've had an impact and it's not the
[1:48:03] spirit of christ in your life amen i
[1:48:05] know what's inside of me i know the
[1:48:06] flesh that is jonathan corlett and it's
[1:48:08] not a pretty thing it's not a good thing
[1:48:10] and when i see that flesh creeping out
[1:48:12] then i go to pray for me before i'll
[1:48:13] ever pray for that person because i want
[1:48:15] the change here i want the change here
[1:48:17] i'm i want to make it to heaven no
[1:48:18] matter what and then once i'm convinced
[1:48:20] that god has dealt with me and i've
[1:48:22] repented and i've made it right now i
[1:48:23] can pray for them i believe that's why
[1:48:25] brother brahm says when you see a
[1:48:26] somebody's done you wrong or this that
[1:48:28] and the other he says go in and pray i
[1:48:30] think the first thing he says god will
[1:48:31] show you what they're dealing with but i
[1:48:32] believe he'll show you what's working in
[1:48:34] your life and what you need to clue up
[1:48:35] as well amen i want to look at my own
[1:48:37] life he says lady if you can't measure
[1:48:39] up to the qualification of a christian
[1:48:41] not as a nominal christian but in your
[1:48:43] heart and your life is patterned exactly
[1:48:46] like god's marriage certificate here
[1:48:49] says it has to be and church member if
[1:48:51] your church isn't like that that can
[1:48:53] measure up to god's qualification of his
[1:48:55] word get out of it and get into christ
[1:48:59] i want to finish with this scripture
[1:49:00] because it speaks of the glory that
[1:49:01] comes after humbling and submission
[1:49:03] amen and it's philippians 2 it says let
[1:49:05] this mind be in you
[1:49:07] which was also in christ jesus who being
[1:49:09] in the form of god thought it not
[1:49:11] robbery to be equal with god but made
[1:49:14] himself of no reputation and took upon
[1:49:17] him the form of a servant and was made
[1:49:20] in the likeness of man
[1:49:22] and being found in fashion as a man
[1:49:24] listen to this now he humbled himself
[1:49:27] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:49:30] death of the cross
[1:49:32] wherefore god also hath highly exalted
[1:49:35] him and given him a name which is above
[1:49:37] every name that at the name of jesus
[1:49:40] every knee should bow of things in
[1:49:42] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:49:45] under the earth amen that's what you
[1:49:47] sisters are reflecting that is the
[1:49:48] highest level of submission is what he
[1:49:50] did what he submitted himself he humbled
[1:49:52] himself to the will of god to the point
[1:49:54] that it took his life
[1:49:56] but guess what he was a dying sacrifice
[1:49:59] you're not called to be a dying
[1:50:00] sacrifice you're called to be a living
[1:50:01] sacrifice and that that stretches it out
[1:50:04] doesn't it now it's not just a one-day
[1:50:06] victory it's not a three-day victory
[1:50:08] like jesus said but this is an everyday
[1:50:10] victory this is an everyday sacrifice
[1:50:12] that you've got to be living amen in
[1:50:14] submission to the word of god that's
[1:50:16] where you've got to be amen you get the
[1:50:18] same reward as the men if you look in
[1:50:19] the scriptures and you look in
[1:50:20] revelations 2 and 3 when it goes through
[1:50:22] it says to him that overcomes now that
[1:50:24] hymn is not a man that him is what it's
[1:50:26] to everybody there's no differentiation
[1:50:28] between women and men when it comes to
[1:50:29] overcomers we all sit with him in the
[1:50:31] throne amen every single one of us is
[1:50:33] going to be a victorious overcomer
[1:50:35] right so in the end you've got to you've
[1:50:37] got to you've got to win your victory
[1:50:38] and we've got to win our victory as men
[1:50:40] amen
[1:50:41] no one's getting out of here without a
[1:50:42] battle that's for sure and then every
[1:50:44] one of us has got to struggle and we're
[1:50:46] just going to face different challenges
[1:50:47] to get there even as women you're going
[1:50:49] to face different challenges than the
[1:50:50] other sisters as men we face different
[1:50:51] challenges based on what god's given us
[1:50:53] the way god's made us right we've got to
[1:50:55] have internal victories we've got to
[1:50:56] have external victories we've got to
[1:50:58] have character flaws that are filled in
[1:51:00] and smoothed out and these different
[1:51:01] things everybody's going to face a
[1:51:03] different battle amen
[1:51:05] amen god bless you let's stand together
[1:51:08] and then i cover your prayers in this
[1:51:09] series and then it was real easy to
[1:51:11] preach to the brothers because i'm a
[1:51:12] brother i have experience being a
[1:51:15] brother
[1:51:16] right i have no experience being a woman
[1:51:19] and then the only type i have is as a
[1:51:21] member of the bride of christ and like i
[1:51:22] said i'm under perfect headship so i
[1:51:24] don't have the struggles the sisters do
[1:51:26] so i'm trying to preach it as tight as i
[1:51:27] can with as much grace as i can amen
[1:51:31] we've got to have an honest
[1:51:32] understanding of where we at where we're
[1:51:34] at right now and then we got to see
[1:51:35] where we're at and it is in a fallen
[1:51:37] condition men and women alike and that's
[1:51:39] why we're talking about these things is
[1:51:40] because we're being brought into what a
[1:51:42] mature perfect condition but the men
[1:51:44] have a different walk than the women do
[1:51:46] it's all through the word but we have
[1:51:48] those different struggles and that's
[1:51:49] going to be difficult for us amen so i
[1:51:51] pray you'll just give me grace as i go
[1:51:54] through this amen because i want the
[1:51:55] sisters to see the tremendous respect
[1:51:57] the tremendous importance the beauty the
[1:52:00] holiness that you reflect in the body of
[1:52:02] christ and then it's it's amazing as we
[1:52:04] get into it the things that the word
[1:52:05] opens up for our sisters and i want you
[1:52:07] to be inspired by this not cut down
[1:52:09] not trim not put in a box there are
[1:52:12] there are boundaries the word has
[1:52:13] boundaries for every one of us amen if
[1:52:16] you're outside the boundaries let's cut
[1:52:17] off the things that are outside the
[1:52:18] boundaries but let's see the beauty of
[1:52:20] what's inside that box amen amen i'm not
[1:52:22] here to limit you i'm here to expand to
[1:52:24] let you see what god sees to try and
[1:52:26] paint the picture that he has for you
[1:52:28] amen let's just power our heads together
[1:52:32] heavenly father
[1:52:35] lord how we need your grace
[1:52:38] lord men and women alike brothers and
[1:52:40] sisters
[1:52:41] married single old and young lord the
[1:52:44] battle never stops
[1:52:46] lord in fact i think the battle just
[1:52:47] rages longer and harder every single day
[1:52:50] lord but you've given us grace lord you
[1:52:53] promised us a
[1:52:54] a a certain end lord and that is that we
[1:52:57] would be overcomers
[1:52:59] and lord so we ask as we continue to
[1:53:01] take this series lord that we would look
[1:53:03] into our own lives lord as brother steve
[1:53:05] said let's not have a pitchfork sermon
[1:53:07] where we're looking at other people but
[1:53:09] lord may we examine ourselves lord so
