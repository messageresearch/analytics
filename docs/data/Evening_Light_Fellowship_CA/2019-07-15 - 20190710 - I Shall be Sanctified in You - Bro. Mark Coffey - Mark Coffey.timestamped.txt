[40:27] bless each heart and soul we pray in
[40:30] Jesus name Amen Lord bless you let's
[40:33] just turn in our scripture first of all
[40:35] we love our scripture reading in Isaiah
[40:38] 53 from in your scripture and we'll read
[40:40] verses 1 to 12 just welcome everybody
[40:43] here tonight and just thankful for this
[40:46] time we can get together and just just
[40:50] run over these things in the word
[40:52] refresh our memories and we just forget
[40:55] so much you know that it's just always
[40:59] good to just go back and refresh update
[41:02] it's good see sister Leah I guess Chad
[41:04] is away ok Isaiah 53 verse 1 who has
[41:11] believed our report and to whom is the
[41:13] arm of the Lord revealed for he shall
[41:16] grow up before him as a tender plant and
[41:19] as a root out of a dry ground he has no
[41:22] form nor comeliness and when we shall
[41:25] see him there is no beauty that we
[41:27] should desire him he is despised and
[41:30] rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[41:33] acquainted with grief and we hid it as
[41:36] it were our faces from him he was
[41:38] despised and we esteemed him not
[41:41] surely he has borne our griefs and
[41:45] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[41:47] him stricken smitten of God and
[41:50] afflicted
[41:52] but he was wounded for our
[41:53] transgressions he was bruised for our
[41:55] iniquity the chest meant of our peace
[41:58] was upon him and with His stripes we
[42:01] were healed and we like sheep have gone
[42:04] astray we have turned every one to his
[42:06] own way and the Lord has laid on him the
[42:09] iniquity of us all
[42:11] amen he has oppressed and he he was
[42:15] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[42:17] opened not his mouth
[42:19] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[42:21] and as a sheep before her Shearer's is
[42:24] dumb so it so he opened not his mouth he
[42:30] was taken from prison and from judgment
[42:32] who shall declare his generation for he
[42:35] was cut off out of the land of the
[42:37] living for the transgression of my
[42:39] people was he stricken and he made his
[42:42] grave with the wicked and with the rich
[42:45] in his death because he had done so had
[42:49] done no violence neither was any deceit
[42:52] in his mouth it had pleased the Lord to
[42:54] bruise him he has put him to grief when
[42:57] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[42:59] sin he shall see his seed he shall
[43:02] prolong his days and a pleasure of the
[43:04] Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall
[43:08] see of the travail of his soul and shall
[43:10] be satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[43:13] righteous servant justify many for he
[43:16] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[43:19] will I divide him a portion with the
[43:20] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[43:24] the strong because he has poured out his
[43:26] soul unto death and he was numbered with
[43:28] the transgressors transgressors and he
[43:31] bare the sin of many and made
[43:34] intercession for the transgressors amen
[43:37] we call the musicians back and sing and
[43:39] go home after reading that Amen he may
[43:44] be seated
[43:45] Mandalore dad's blessing to the reading
[43:47] of his word tonight so just just a
[43:52] couple of things - I did hear from
[43:54] brother Colombo today he called and as
[43:58] the Sunday school group had taken their
[44:01] money that they collected and they
[44:05] into I gave it as a donation to brother
[44:10] Colombo for his mission and he called
[44:13] today just say thanks for that's what I
[44:14] the first part of it was collected and
[44:17] rolled and and all that hasn't been done
[44:19] but the first part was just just two
[44:22] hundred dollars so that was good and
[44:24] brother Colombo certainly appreciated
[44:26] that and he travels tomorrow to the
[44:28] Congo I think for two and a half weeks
[44:30] so we want to he has to be remembered in
[44:32] prayer and he asked me to mention that
[44:34] to the church that he was very thankful
[44:35] for that donation going towards the
[44:39] cause in Congo that he's going on in the
[44:41] next little while and of course it's
[44:43] been a it's been something he's done for
[44:47] a while amen
[44:49] warm up here so anyway so just a couple
[44:55] of things here I just want to talk about
[44:57] undie song service was like right in
[44:59] line with this which is good you know it
[45:02] just makes your heart go bubble bubble
[45:04] bubble you know to quote you know
[45:06] brother brother Ron uh-huh and so that
[45:10] we you know where you going along and so
[45:11] it's just a little exhortation and I
[45:13] just want to talk about the Blood and
[45:15] the Holy Ghost and those things and just
[45:16] put it together back in the basics so
[45:19] that we can you know just refresh
[45:21] ourselves because many times you know we
[45:23] just go and everything gets jumbled up
[45:24] you know how life is it's just a jumble
[45:27] and the devil is good at that that
[45:29] distracting us and where we're hearing
[45:31] so many ideas coming in all the time and
[45:33] and different things but really right
[45:36] through the whole Bible there's a
[45:37] there's a path there you know just like
[45:40] pilgrim and he had to find this and
[45:42] there was a lot on the side and a lot on
[45:44] you know to set him astray or divert
[45:47] them or to deceive him so we just try to
[45:51] keep you know every now and then just
[45:52] try to you know we can kind of see the
[45:55] light at the end of the tunnel ins is
[45:56] good in our lives because it's just so
[45:58] busy and those things so so you know our
[46:03] life you know we started you know in the
[46:06] flesh and it was very contrary contrary
[46:10] to the Spirit of God we were born that
[46:12] way you know we had no choice
[46:14] you know and
[46:15] there was our mind with a mind that was
[46:18] an enmity with God there was just
[46:21] nothing in common with garden-party just
[46:23] that it can never that the mind the
[46:28] carnal mind can never agree with God's
[46:30] Word it will never be subject to that
[46:32] and a chance to come to God is is 0% for
[46:36] us to come to God if you're here today
[46:39] and you're serving God you know that is
[46:41] by grace we know that that's grace that
[46:43] brought you and it's God rich in mercy
[46:45] that will bring you to the the point
[46:48] where you will recognize God and
[46:50] surrender your life to God
[46:52] other than that at 0% you can't do it I
[46:54] know for a fact it wouldn't have
[46:56] happened I mean you could be raised up
[46:58] in a church you know your whole life or
[46:59] whatever in the message church but
[47:02] unless God comes you know it's it's the
[47:05] only way that you're gonna receive that
[47:07] grace is for God to come and and find
[47:10] you if you go looking for God that's
[47:13] denomination right that's just your own
[47:15] your own your own mind putting things
[47:18] together and go on and looking for God
[47:20] and that's what turns into it's just a
[47:22] man's religion so was God rich and mercy
[47:25] and it was grace that saved you so just
[47:29] um I just wanted to it's kind of
[47:32] different but I just wanted to play
[47:33] something by brother Lonnie it's it's an
[47:37] old thing I saw just a little while ago
[47:39] and it's only a little four or five
[47:41] minutes but I think it's it's kind of a
[47:43] good introduction into into this this
[47:48] what we're gonna just go through today
[47:50] and it's just a little Bible teaching
[47:52] and he talks about this picture right
[47:55] here in something grass what wasn't
[48:02] dumbing down where this picture was
[48:05] taken and he talks about he talks about
[48:08] this behind him here so I rather me
[48:13] going through it I think it's just
[48:14] basically just watch that little Clint
[48:16] but I don't know if people know very
[48:18] much about you know this this picture
[48:22] and just one of the things that he had
[48:25] explained to Sidney Jackson who or Loni
[48:28] calls a prom
[48:29] I believe he was and he he he he was
[48:33] talking about around a brother brems
[48:34] explained in this picture to him and
[48:36] explained in this part and of course
[48:39] brother Lonnie was in Tucson and Sidney
[48:41] Jackson was there for a good while and
[48:43] this is what Sidney Jackson brother
[48:45] Sidney Jackson had told brother Lonnie
[48:47] about about that I thought it was very
[48:49] good
[48:50] so I don't know if people are familiar
[48:51] we can just pass that around but if a
[48:53] brother brother Matthew can just play
[48:56] that for us Romans 8
[49:23] I quickly ran off a slide in the back
[49:26] room while ago and I don't think it's
[49:29] going to project it's a slide of this
[49:31] picture which was the seven licks of
[49:33] fire the supernatural picture taken in
[49:36] Grass Valley California and I don't
[49:39] think it's going to project what I want
[49:41] projected so I did a little ink addition
[49:45] on it right there and if you ever get
[49:49] this picture in your hand again you can
[49:50] look for that little picture there
[49:53] because it didn't show up on this
[49:54] transparency but I've told you before
[49:58] but I've never shown you the picture I
[50:00] was talking with builder Sydney Jackson
[50:02] one day prophet from South Africa that
[50:04] was a close friend of brother banners
[50:06] and he's brother he said brother Branham
[50:08] took this picture and he says brother
[50:11] Sydney he says look close behind me on
[50:13] the platform holding up this this
[50:15] picture and he says look closely behind
[50:19] me he says do you see that face that
[50:22] looks like an old Indian chief or
[50:24] something and brother Jackson says yes I
[50:28] see that said I've never noticed that
[50:29] there before he says that's my old
[50:32] nature
[50:33] he said it's always there to haunt you
[50:37] he says when he says when you receive
[50:42] Christ and his word now I'm going to do
[50:45] my hands the way Sydney did because it's
[50:48] very significant and he said that's the
[50:50] way brother Brennan did he says when you
[50:52] stand and receive the word for the hour
[50:55] the revelation of the hour he says that
[50:57] Holy Ghost fire comes down into your
[51:00] soul and he says burns out the old
[51:03] nature he didn't say a word but you got
[51:09] a picture it loses the position of
[51:12] Dominion but it moves to a place of
[51:16] influence it cannot make you do anything
[51:20] but it'll talk to you as if it's in the
[51:23] same place that it always was but it has
[51:27] no power and he says that he says my old
[51:31] nature looks like an Indian chief
[51:33] because he says
[51:34] cause my mother was half Indian now if
[51:39] that happened to a prophet that's what
[51:42] happens to every child of God the old
[51:45] nature is burned out of you and your new
[51:49] nature is God but the old nature is
[51:54] always there to haunt you it'll try to
[51:58] condemn you over the things that it did
[52:01] in your body are you following me so
[52:06] consequently that's why God says you are
[52:10] a new creature why because the control
[52:14] tower inside is brand new absolutely new
[52:18] and didn't do a thing against God and
[52:21] that's why you can stand justified
[52:24] before God as if you never did it
[52:26] because you the real you the
[52:29] predestinated soul from God you did not
[52:32] do it it was that in nature that did it
[52:36] and were you perfectly you from the
[52:38] beginning you wouldn't have done it
[52:41] so therefore the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:43] washes away all of the old past it's
[52:46] gone you're not held accountable anymore
[52:48] that's why the Prophet says we answer to
[52:51] God for the spirit that we allowed to
[52:55] use our body
[53:03] I could go through a list a mile long of
[53:07] things that are all flesh and yet we
[53:14] still allow it to manifest in our life
[53:16] and think we're okay doing it you're
[53:20] giving over to the wrong thing because
[53:22] the flesh is tied with that old nature
[53:25] Noah bromans eight now I don't know if
[53:32] anyone's heard that before if it would
[53:37] ever came up but I thought it was
[53:39] interesting and I'll probably just
[53:42] transcribe it not send it out to
[53:43] everyone so you'll have just a copy of
[53:45] it you know what he said there you know
[53:47] because it's it it's good to know there
[53:50] how are these sometimes mechanics work
[53:53] you know and why you had that influence
[53:55] so that's kind of what I was gonna just
[53:59] hug go into a bit here just explain a
[54:04] little bit of that I'll never do it like
[54:06] what I think ins you know God versus
[54:09] home we should just play that that would
[54:16] have work force so I just I just wanted
[54:20] to speak just a little bit here and it
[54:23] just won't be too long you get going
[54:26] here but and it's just talked about that
[54:30] and go into a little bit more Medici
[54:34] about what he just talked about then
[54:36] just knowing you know what that
[54:37] influence how that influences on your
[54:40] life and that only chair that old man
[54:42] and his brother branham and just places
[54:45] him there right behind you know any and
[54:47] it gets picked up in the picture and we
[54:49] all know that that old man just stands
[54:51] for it stands there all the time
[54:52] torment you know and that's how the
[54:54] devil work works through him but he's
[54:57] and it's important to two words he'd be
[54:59] he is an influencer and and he doesn't
[55:02] have dominion or domination over anyone
[55:06] anymore who is born again by the Holy
[55:09] Spirit but it'll be there until the did
[55:14] thank you it'll be there until
[55:16] day you die you know you will if you
[55:20] wear a rapture it'll be there that that
[55:22] day before you know when it happens or
[55:25] if you go you know the way it a grave
[55:28] you'll be in your deathbed and you'll be
[55:29] still dealing with those with that thing
[55:32] because that remains there forever
[55:34] because you're in the flesh and that's
[55:36] why you need the blood still that's why
[55:39] you need an intercessor and and the
[55:41] intercessor is still interceding for you
[55:44] the son of God is still you know the the
[55:47] the the priest the high priest there is
[55:51] still on that mercy seat and the blood
[55:54] is still there for the bride in this
[55:56] hour so the Holy Ghost comes upon our
[55:59] lives and and we have an experience so
[56:01] so when we look at it we look at the
[56:05] ourselves here the this poor soul here
[56:08] in the middle who's trying to get to the
[56:11] end and we we see that there's the Holy
[56:14] Ghost and there's also the blood here
[56:17] I need and you it kind of ask yourself
[56:20] which keeps you is that the Holy Ghost
[56:22] that keeps you it's a blood how does
[56:24] this work in between and they're so they
[56:27] just I put up that slide they're very
[56:29] Mathew doing I just showed us a quote
[56:37] which is just me so here in the
[56:45] indictment message bar I'm says that's
[56:48] the reason we don't see things happening
[56:50] in the churches they confess that they
[56:52] believe the blood but they reject the
[56:54] very plan to get to the blood which is
[56:57] the word so the way to have the blood
[56:59] working for you is through the word for
[57:02] your day that's how you have access to
[57:05] the blood and not everyone has access to
[57:07] the blood so we know that you know that
[57:13] you know what I mentioned before about
[57:16] Calvary and Calvary you know we can we
[57:20] can never forget Calvary because that
[57:22] was that's where the the blood atonement
[57:25] was made so all through the Old
[57:26] Testament you know they used the blood
[57:29] of bulls and go
[57:30] once a year to cover sin but it never
[57:31] took away it just covered the sin but
[57:34] there was going to come a savior as we
[57:36] read in Isaiah 53 that would that would
[57:39] you know complete or do away with the
[57:44] the same question forever by the
[57:46] shedding of the blood on Calvary so you
[57:49] know when you look at John 3:16 for God
[57:52] so loved the world that He gave His only
[57:54] begotten Son it's talking about that on
[57:56] Calvary and whosoever believes in him
[57:59] shall be saved and that is true because
[58:01] at on Calvary I'm just going off already
[58:05] so on Calvary here you know the the
[58:09] price was paid here for everybody it was
[58:13] for the whole world so as we read down
[58:16] here through Isaiah 53 it says it says
[58:19] in verse 4 shortly he had borne our
[58:21] griefs and carried our sorrows so you
[58:25] know he didn't have a hidden have those
[58:27] sorrows but he had the sorrows of the
[58:28] world that were on that cross that he
[58:31] died for that day and he completed it
[58:34] for anyone who comes with a depression
[58:36] or a sorrow he he he healed him of that
[58:40] right and he was he was stricken he was
[58:46] smitten of God he was afflicted and
[58:48] surely has borne our griefs and carried
[58:50] our sorrows right there on the cross
[58:52] he's done this prophecy is talking about
[58:54] Jesus on the cross and he did esteem him
[58:57] stricken smitten of God and afflicted
[58:59] all of that he was wounded for our
[59:01] transgressions in verse 5 he was bruised
[59:04] for our iniquity so all our mistakes all
[59:07] the ones that were done in the Old
[59:08] Testament all the ones that were done in
[59:09] the New Testament all the ones that were
[59:11] being done then it was all it was all
[59:14] you know resolved right there there was
[59:16] there was there was no more sin right
[59:20] then at that point in time there was no
[59:21] more sin it was all and still today
[59:24] there's no more sin in the sight of God
[59:25] but in order for you mahat the effect of
[59:30] that you had to accept it so you see
[59:32] that he died for all the world but all
[59:35] the world is not going to accept it but
[59:37] if you wanted and God leads you to it
[59:39] then he will he will heal you of all
[59:42] your disease
[59:43] so if you're sick if you're sick then
[59:46] you brother Brian says even if if Christ
[59:49] was right here
[59:50] he couldn't heal me because he did it
[59:51] all at Calvary and you have to claim it
[59:53] right so I think I have a I got a couple
[59:58] of quotes on that so he says here in a
[1:00:04] way of a true prophet in the bowl if I
[1:00:06] was our Lord Jesus Christ standing here
[1:00:08] and this woman was sick you know I could
[1:00:10] not heal her if I was the Lord Jesus I
[1:00:13] couldn't do it because I've already done
[1:00:14] it he did it at Calvary has already
[1:00:16] forgive your sin he's forgiven every sin
[1:00:19] every sin that you will do every sin
[1:00:21] that you did he is he is forgiven you
[1:00:25] he's he's already healed every sick
[1:00:28] person
[1:00:29] he's already appropriated that blood at
[1:00:32] the Calvary the price is already paid
[1:00:34] it's already paid the only thing you
[1:00:36] have to do is accept it believe it and
[1:00:39] accept it and you cannot accept it until
[1:00:42] you first until first you believe it so
[1:00:47] that's how that's how John 3:16 works
[1:00:50] because people say well Jesus died for
[1:00:53] us all he did die for you he he died for
[1:00:55] every sin that you committed an area you
[1:00:57] will commit but you have to accept it
[1:00:59] and they don't accept it they turn away
[1:01:01] and they turn away from the word that
[1:01:03] would lead them to the blood that would
[1:01:05] that would now they could claim through
[1:01:07] the blood that was shed on Calvary that
[1:01:11] day it was the greatest day ever but he
[1:01:13] still had to be resurrected or it was no
[1:01:15] good because that life would not come
[1:01:17] back on the thing so so it was
[1:01:19] justification it was the blood was shed
[1:01:22] for everyone and God can't do anything
[1:01:25] for you now that he's already done
[1:01:27] program says it many times right we
[1:01:29] heard him say that many times just see
[1:01:33] what he says here he says Lord Jesus I
[1:01:35] accept your atonement I'm a sinner you
[1:01:37] were saved back there you were healed
[1:01:39] back there you just accept it by faith
[1:01:41] you saved by faith you accept your
[1:01:43] salvation and anybody comes around tells
[1:01:47] you that that they got healed they got
[1:01:51] healing power and they can heal you you
[1:01:54] stay plumb clear
[1:01:56] of that because it's now healing power
[1:01:58] is in Christ already a finished work if
[1:02:01] a man tells you God has give him power
[1:02:04] to forgive your sins and do that don't
[1:02:06] you believe it right Catherine says that
[1:02:09] they're already forgiven Jesus standing
[1:02:11] here tonight the only thing it would
[1:02:13] declare that he was the son of God what
[1:02:17] if he was what if now my hands was full
[1:02:19] of nail scars and blood running out of
[1:02:21] them and thorns a cross hair they were
[1:02:23] they still won't make it Jesus they
[1:02:26] would be my flesh and he knows that
[1:02:29] flesh is sitting on the right hand of
[1:02:30] God and when it comes time will be no
[1:02:33] more that's right when Jesus descends
[1:02:35] that's all of it but he's here in the
[1:02:38] spirit form and then his life is in you
[1:02:41] and I to give your faith and to give me
[1:02:45] faith so the we know the body is there
[1:02:48] at the right hand of God and it's the
[1:02:52] the the blood is there to atone for our
[1:02:56] sins and the Holy Spirit because he
[1:02:58] resurrected the Holy Spirit then comes
[1:03:01] back on the believer to so that he can
[1:03:03] dwell in that life and that blood
[1:03:06] cleanses away because God in all the Old
[1:03:09] Testament he couldn't he couldn't come
[1:03:11] into a believer so David Abraham all of
[1:03:14] them God could anoint them but they he
[1:03:17] could never dwell in them because it has
[1:03:19] to be a sanctified it has to be a
[1:03:22] sanctified place for God to dwell so so
[1:03:27] so the blood of goats and and lambs and
[1:03:32] things like that could not did not have
[1:03:34] the power to sanctify a place for God to
[1:03:38] spirit to dwell but at Eden Calvary on
[1:03:41] Calvary he made a way they made that way
[1:03:45] which we we see here in in Isaiah 53
[1:03:50] which is amazingly so so accurate that
[1:03:54] Isaiah he must have fully saw what was
[1:03:58] happening there because it was all
[1:04:00] complete right there it was it was it
[1:04:04] was a salvation for man
[1:04:05] kind it was right back in in the
[1:04:08] beginning and if we turn over to let's
[1:04:12] just turn over to Ezekiel Ezekiel 36 and
[1:04:19] all through the Old Testament it's
[1:04:22] prophesied in in there and in Isaiah 42
[1:04:25] and in Psalms and right here in Isaiah
[1:04:29] 36 and it talks about what God was gonna
[1:04:33] do because he just realized with Israel
[1:04:37] he realized that I mean of course he
[1:04:39] knew it all the time but they could
[1:04:41] never complete
[1:04:42] he never do what he wants them to do so
[1:04:46] basically he said in his prophecy that
[1:04:49] I'm going to come in to you and I'm not
[1:04:51] gonna try to adapt this problem or fix
[1:04:55] it you know I am just gonna come in to
[1:04:57] you and I'm gonna do it
[1:04:58] so as I kiyul 36 verse 16 moreover the
[1:05:03] word of the Lord came unto me saying son
[1:05:05] of man when the house of Israel dwelt in
[1:05:08] their own land they defile it by their
[1:05:10] own way and by their doings their way
[1:05:14] was before me as the uncleanliness of a
[1:05:18] removed woman wherefore that means
[1:05:20] because of this because of this i poured
[1:05:23] my fury upon them for the blood that
[1:05:26] they had shed upon the land and for
[1:05:29] their idols wherewith they had polluted
[1:05:31] it and i scattered them among the
[1:05:33] heathen and they were dispersed through
[1:05:36] the countries we know that Israel was
[1:05:38] scattered through the through the
[1:05:40] different lands in amongst the heathen
[1:05:42] and according in their way and according
[1:05:46] to their doings I judged them and when
[1:05:49] they entered unto the heathen whether
[1:05:51] they went they profaned my holy name
[1:05:54] so you notice there he didn't say they
[1:05:57] profane me they were they profane God he
[1:06:00] always will use the term they profane
[1:06:02] mine they profaned my holy name right
[1:06:05] that's what he's protecting there is is
[1:06:07] that that name because we know where we
[1:06:11] know with with the Jews they always said
[1:06:13] like you know what is your name you
[1:06:16] don't need to give him a name he said
[1:06:17] Moses you know Moses said to the people
[1:06:19] there you know it said to God why don't
[1:06:21] I tell the people who you were and he
[1:06:22] said you know I am the I am and he was
[1:06:24] satisfied with that but it was always
[1:06:25] like like Paul in in when he was struck
[1:06:29] by by that light and and Jesus came and
[1:06:32] he said who are you know what is your
[1:06:33] name you know what is your name and
[1:06:35] that's what they look for right because
[1:06:37] they they they always and they wouldn't
[1:06:40] even say the name right they always used
[1:06:42] to use consonants when they didn't write
[1:06:44] that name they didn't want to say it
[1:06:46] because of it was so holy right and we
[1:06:49] know and then we know and when the angel
[1:06:51] Gabriel came to Mary he said now call
[1:06:54] his name Jesus right because it had to
[1:06:57] be that name it is really important
[1:07:00] about the name of God and you would
[1:07:03] think so he said just when they profane
[1:07:10] my Holy Name when they said to them
[1:07:12] these are the people of the Lord and are
[1:07:15] gone forth out of his land now here in
[1:07:18] verse 21 but I had pity for mine Holy
[1:07:21] Name which the house of Israel has
[1:07:24] profaned among the heathen whether they
[1:07:27] went therefore say unto the house of
[1:07:29] Israel thus saith the Lord God I do this
[1:07:32] for your sakes or house of Israel but
[1:07:36] for mine holy namesake which ye have
[1:07:40] profaned among the heathen whether you
[1:07:43] went because they were supposed to
[1:07:44] represent God his name right and God did
[1:07:48] never did one he never did want idols or
[1:07:51] statues or a four-foot statue of some
[1:07:55] animal to represent his name or his
[1:07:57] image right he wanted a living living
[1:08:01] representation of his name and that
[1:08:04] living was going to be his people so he
[1:08:07] wanted that's why you never see images
[1:08:09] in you know like in the in in Jewish
[1:08:12] Christian play you know you don't see
[1:08:14] images because God has to live in living
[1:08:19] things his his family right there was
[1:08:23] the plan and I will sanctify my great
[1:08:26] verse 23 and I will sanctify my great
[1:08:30] name which
[1:08:31] was profaned among the heathens which he
[1:08:34] have profaned in the midst of them and
[1:08:36] the heathen shall know that i am the
[1:08:39] lord i am the lord saith the lord god
[1:08:41] when i shall be sanctified in you before
[1:08:45] their eyes so so in verse 23 and i will
[1:08:53] sanctify my great name which was
[1:08:55] profaned among the heathens which he
[1:08:57] have profaned in the midst of them and
[1:08:59] the heathen shall know that i am the
[1:09:00] lord saith the lord god when i shall be
[1:09:04] sanctified in you before their eyes so
[1:09:07] he says i will be sanctified in you so i
[1:09:11] will sanctify that place and then i will
[1:09:14] dwell in you this is the prophecy that
[1:09:16] was to come under which was fulfilled at
[1:09:19] the day of pentecost rain so Christ died
[1:09:22] and resurrected fifty days later we
[1:09:24] seated to see the day of Pentecost and
[1:09:26] that was the 50-day Jubilee where they
[1:09:28] were released right and they received
[1:09:31] what / - is is the abstract title deed
[1:09:34] so they then possessed what Adam lost
[1:09:37] back in the garden even they got the
[1:09:40] title for that do in an earnest right
[1:09:42] but the abstract says it was it was it
[1:09:45] was cleared right back to God right so
[1:09:49] now they received that on that day and
[1:09:52] received that in in hearings but also
[1:09:54] there was a place sanctified in these
[1:09:57] people because the blood was shed at
[1:09:59] Calvary and and the Holy Ghost came down
[1:10:02] in that hour and dwelt in those people
[1:10:05] and that was the start of the New
[1:10:08] Testament the New Covenant where God
[1:10:10] would come down and fulfill this he says
[1:10:12] I'm going to come down and live inside
[1:10:15] of you and do it for you because you
[1:10:17] couldn't do it and that is wonderful
[1:10:19] here's how it's going to and here's how
[1:10:22] he was going to do it verse 24 for I
[1:10:24] will take you from among the heathen and
[1:10:27] gather you out of all the countries and
[1:10:29] will bring you into your own land this
[1:10:32] is familiar then will I sprinkle clean
[1:10:34] water upon you and ye shall be clean
[1:10:36] from all your filthiness and from all
[1:10:39] your idols for like lend you a new heart
[1:10:42] also will I give you
[1:10:44] a new spirit or like put within you and
[1:10:46] I will take away the stony heart of your
[1:10:48] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[1:10:50] flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:10:52] you and cause you to walk in my statue
[1:10:55] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[1:10:59] them and what was what was promised
[1:11:03] there came to pass in the upper room
[1:11:06] experience and on that first day it was
[1:11:10] the first day the first church we we see
[1:11:13] received back into their possession a
[1:11:15] title deed to eternal life that Adam had
[1:11:18] held Amen so so all through the Old
[1:11:22] Testament it was a revealing of God
[1:11:25] through the different people so that you
[1:11:27] know they could you know see God
[1:11:29] revealed and understand and understand
[1:11:32] who God was because God was so complex
[1:11:34] and it took all this time and all this
[1:11:37] time and all these experiences that he
[1:11:40] he would do it and and and many times
[1:11:42] there would be a prophecy it's like you
[1:11:44] know Abraham you know you know what the
[1:11:47] prophecy of Moses down in that land you
[1:11:49] know and you know the one was a prophecy
[1:11:52] but then he would come down into a
[1:11:54] person and he would he would fulfill
[1:11:58] that prophecy and he would do that for
[1:12:00] his name you don't the name was so
[1:12:02] important so that people could could see
[1:12:05] the name of God it was a manifestation
[1:12:06] Terp rotational that word was those
[1:12:09] people doing what what the prophecy was
[1:12:12] to fulfill so in in what I was getting
[1:12:15] to here just back to that so it with the
[1:12:20] Holy Ghost saying what the what the Holy
[1:12:26] Ghost is for and what the blood is for
[1:12:28] and we know that it's a grace that saved
[1:12:30] us through faith Ephesians chapter two
[1:12:32] and this is what was what was being
[1:12:36] fulfilled in each one of us on that day
[1:12:38] on that fateful day in in the day of
[1:12:41] Pentecost so the Holy Ghost is really
[1:12:45] what it what it does such as some of the
[1:12:47] things that it does I'll just list them
[1:12:50] here is it it's really what came and
[1:12:54] tracked you down because like we said
[1:12:56] you could never you'll just
[1:12:59] you'll never it never you'll never find
[1:13:02] your way you know there's no way you can
[1:13:05] find it because your mind is enmity with
[1:13:07] God you cannot you're you're dead in
[1:13:10] trespasses and sins but unless you know
[1:13:13] the Holy Spirit it comes and he's the
[1:13:17] one that bring the Holy Spirit is the
[1:13:19] one that brings that seed that's in you
[1:13:21] seed to life in you right because we
[1:13:27] know that lays dormant in you and that's
[1:13:29] the one that will it it'll empower it'll
[1:13:32] empower you and it will undo you with
[1:13:36] power as that's what happened
[1:13:39] in the in the upper room so it will give
[1:13:43] you right standing with God I just kind
[1:13:49] of wrote them in there so there could be
[1:13:51] more here it gives you a right right
[1:13:54] right how's the right standing with God
[1:13:56] and as we know it's a comforter right
[1:14:00] and it's a guide so it does guide you
[1:14:05] and you understand that right you live
[1:14:08] in that right now you understand that it
[1:14:10] will guide you you know your safety what
[1:14:12] do I go why do I go here what I got
[1:14:14] there you know why didn't I do this why
[1:14:15] did I do this you know it's a it's a
[1:14:17] it's a guide for you and it direction
[1:14:23] and if you know it's it's it's what's
[1:14:27] gonna guide you into maturity you know
[1:14:30] in the end as a son of God and as as a
[1:14:36] maturity and also in a state of rapture
[1:14:41] for us because that's that's what you
[1:14:44] know will that's that's a word that will
[1:14:46] be interpreted in us right it won't be
[1:14:49] it won't be God over here it's gonna be
[1:14:51] God in us who'll interpret the word just
[1:14:54] like all the instances would you see in
[1:14:56] the Bible right because we had to come
[1:14:58] to that so it directs you it guides you
[1:15:01] it's a comforter to show you these
[1:15:03] things and again it it keeps it tries to
[1:15:07] keep you from
[1:15:10] from sin sinning and because as you know
[1:15:14] it warns you how many have been warned
[1:15:16] you know how many have been warned by
[1:15:19] the Holy Spirit right do not look at
[1:15:21] that you know do not go in there you
[1:15:24] know don't don't listen to that and we
[1:15:30] all got experiences to them and you know
[1:15:33] as you go and grace you know there's
[1:15:36] there's more there's you know there's
[1:15:39] more and also also in entitles you you
[1:15:47] know so so those are the those are the
[1:15:52] things but over here with the blood with
[1:15:56] the blood that's that the the price that
[1:15:58] was paid at Calvary in the blood that
[1:15:59] was shed what does that do for us right
[1:16:03] well that that's what keeps you so
[1:16:08] before so here if you you can relate to
[1:16:13] this so we can all relate to it I can
[1:16:15] relate to it this week and you know
[1:16:18] you're here
[1:16:20] and in that flesh and that's all nature
[1:16:24] you know is what the challenges in your
[1:16:27] life right and that that's a sin nature
[1:16:29] that's a sin nature that you have and I
[1:16:32] said you didn't lose this in nature but
[1:16:35] it it's still there with you because
[1:16:38] you're in the flesh because the the
[1:16:41] spirit and the in the body are of the
[1:16:45] beast nature and you had that beast
[1:16:47] nature and so you'll always have that
[1:16:50] you'll hall always had that but you have
[1:16:52] to keep it pressed down and in subject
[1:16:54] and that's just because it has a sin
[1:16:56] nature the sin nature that you were born
[1:16:58] with you're born in iniquity shaped in
[1:17:01] iniquity born in sin so you have to keep
[1:17:04] that in subjection all your life so you
[1:17:07] you you you have to to do that so when
[1:17:11] when something happens that she did
[1:17:15] wrong and you shouldn't have done it
[1:17:16] better Lonnie said you know there was a
[1:17:18] hundred things that he could list in the
[1:17:20] flesh then brother Branham says that
[1:17:23] that dog
[1:17:23] of you know that dove will fly off over
[1:17:26] here right until you settle down and you
[1:17:29] feel it you feel that anointing you know
[1:17:33] you see it you feel cold right you feel
[1:17:36] like you know like you'll feel like that
[1:17:38] and you know it doesn't you make a
[1:17:41] mistake right you make a mistake and
[1:17:43] that happens and that Holy Ghost that
[1:17:47] that dove there will take its flight
[1:17:49] from you right and then you'll go
[1:17:52] through a trial you had to learn it's
[1:17:53] all a learning experience right but so
[1:17:57] you feel like gee you know I made a
[1:18:00] mistake you know I'm not I haven't got
[1:18:03] the Holy Ghost right and that's not true
[1:18:04] that's not true you know like yeah the
[1:18:08] devil is saying to you you never got the
[1:18:09] Holy Ghost you know that the Holy Ghost
[1:18:11] you didn't get the Holy Ghost God you
[1:18:13] know he's gone he's not gonna and you
[1:18:15] know you feel like that because the but
[1:18:18] we just read you know you're covered
[1:18:20] from every sin you know on Calvary
[1:18:24] everything is paid everything is done
[1:18:26] and you've accepted it right you've
[1:18:29] accepted what Christ did on there and
[1:18:31] the blood cleansed every bit of it and
[1:18:33] the devil is reminding you of these
[1:18:35] things it might be something that you
[1:18:37] you did years and years ago right and
[1:18:40] you're feeling now guilty does and the
[1:18:45] influencer is bringing it up in your
[1:18:47] mind and your now you're thinking about
[1:18:49] it again and and you say hey you know
[1:18:52] you're you feel so sorry I did it and
[1:18:54] and God is up there scratching his head
[1:18:57] because he doesn't know what he's
[1:18:58] talking about because he has put it in
[1:19:01] the sea of forgetfulness and he could
[1:19:03] forget so he doesn't know what you're
[1:19:06] talking about you're just going babbling
[1:19:08] on as far as he's concerned because he
[1:19:10] doesn't see you
[1:19:11] right Bertram says he only hears you
[1:19:14] right so he he has said that's behind
[1:19:18] right this has nothing to do with us
[1:19:20] anymore here we're moving on there
[1:19:23] but say that influencer will torment you
[1:19:26] so what what really keeps you is the
[1:19:29] blood the blood keeps you even when you
[1:19:31] feel like this
[1:19:32] you know and the Holy Spirit is doing
[1:19:34] all these things for you because the
[1:19:36] Holy Spirit comes back you know and you
[1:19:38] feel that again you know Bourbons
[1:19:39] fending off
[1:19:40] he lost the holy holy spirit for six
[1:19:43] months I can't remember now what it was
[1:19:46] I can't remember but he said you know I
[1:19:49] never felt the anointing for six months
[1:19:52] you know at all
[1:19:54] I told bond he came back and he says so
[1:20:00] it keeps you it sanctifies you it speaks
[1:20:07] for you because we know that from from
[1:20:12] Abel he came down and he said the blood
[1:20:16] is speaking Abel's blood was speaking
[1:20:18] Cain you know so if I make a mistake a
[1:20:25] mistake I'm covered right now when I
[1:20:30] talk my unbelief
[1:20:31] you know we're talking with some things
[1:20:33] on the flesh my belief is in the soul
[1:20:36] like you know sin and sinning as to his
[1:20:39] sin is unbelief right so so you know
[1:20:42] just my own experience I mean from the
[1:20:45] very dot you know when I came in contact
[1:20:49] with it with the with the word and you
[1:20:52] know it was true that added and stuff
[1:20:54] like that I mean the Holy Spirit was
[1:20:56] there with me that's a time right and
[1:20:58] from that point on I never doubted his
[1:21:02] message once you know so I can't you
[1:21:08] know by the grace of God I cannot deny
[1:21:10] it
[1:21:11] I cannot denies the truth I know brother
[1:21:14] Brennan was a word prophet because when
[1:21:17] he spoke something in my soul said
[1:21:19] that's right
[1:21:21] it was just rebounded right there it
[1:21:23] just clenched in there at the head the
[1:21:25] one not so you know when we have a week
[1:21:30] we have weak spots here everybody knows
[1:21:34] that we're still in the flesh
[1:21:36] it comes might come from your you
[1:21:37] something you had or your grap your
[1:21:40] father your grandfather or way back
[1:21:43] whatever it's all you know it's all part
[1:21:45] of your ancestry or what whatever it is
[1:21:48] and it could be you know money I'm
[1:21:52] saying now popularity this is the ones
[1:21:54] program talk about popularity women
[1:21:57] these are for preachers here and it
[1:22:00] could be it with church you know you
[1:22:03] have problems you have trouble with
[1:22:06] clothes maybe I'm just doing the list of
[1:22:09] a hundred here now entertainment leisure
[1:22:13] you know what what you could fall you're
[1:22:17] stuck to some music or something you
[1:22:20] know could be something family life you
[1:22:22] know it's a weak the weakness their
[1:22:23] friends you know you're still kind of
[1:22:26] frequenting that it could be work it to
[1:22:29] caught up with that you know it's just
[1:22:30] these things in life with which we can
[1:22:33] you you know like that you might not
[1:22:34] have subject to some people have no
[1:22:37] problem with this but they might have
[1:22:38] problem with that you know internet that
[1:22:40] don't forget internet or something you
[1:22:42] know all these things devices you know
[1:22:46] things that would distract your things
[1:22:48] that would you know you know bring you
[1:22:50] away from God bring you know just move
[1:22:53] you away you know that some things you
[1:22:54] have to do is required you know but you
[1:22:57] know there's grace for all of that but
[1:22:58] you know you could be going too far with
[1:23:01] things those are the week's top week
[1:23:03] things that the blood the blood covers
[1:23:05] right you know you could be could be
[1:23:10] slack and stuff you could be slack with
[1:23:13] your church-going you know you say well
[1:23:16] I won't go tonight or whatever your
[1:23:18] prayer your your fellowship you know
[1:23:23] your Bible reading all of these things
[1:23:26] you know all of these things that you
[1:23:28] had to deal with but the the blood keeps
[1:23:31] you it doesn't matter what the blog key
[1:23:35] so once you turn and you repent you know
[1:23:38] it's just like David you know and we do
[1:23:40] it the Sheba and and Uriah you know when
[1:23:44] he you know when he went to repent God
[1:23:46] forgave them
[1:23:47] punish them right and you'll feel
[1:23:50] punishment but he's only just getting
[1:23:53] you into a place where you need to go
[1:23:54] and if you go off to the side well he'll
[1:23:57] bring it he'll bring you around them so
[1:23:59] it's grace its grace that brought me and
[1:24:02] grace Ted so here so here so the devil
[1:24:22] the devil is here in all of these things
[1:24:25] to distract you so when you make a
[1:24:28] mistake you know the debt the Holy
[1:24:31] Spirit will will move away from you but
[1:24:33] that blood never moves away from you
[1:24:36] that blood is there it'll cover you as
[1:24:38] long as you're into the in the flesh you
[1:24:41] know and you accept that sacrifice at
[1:24:43] Calvary and you will always have that
[1:24:46] atonement that'll keep you so that's
[1:24:48] what you look to right you know you look
[1:24:51] to that so that sacrifice that was made
[1:24:53] on that day that brought me and and it's
[1:24:58] wonderful and God sees sees you through
[1:25:01] the blood of Jesus Christ and that sin
[1:25:04] nature will always have with us and
[1:25:06] brother and Abraham didn't have the Holy
[1:25:08] Ghost right he never did you know and
[1:25:11] God spoke to him you know he didn't grab
[1:25:13] him by the neck you know get up that
[1:25:15] hill and even to kill his own son you
[1:25:18] know Abraham's had just walked and just
[1:25:22] did it without the Holy Ghost so it's
[1:25:26] it's a tremendous testimony and we stand
[1:25:29] today now he had his things he had his
[1:25:32] things you know when he went to Egypt
[1:25:34] and with his with Sarah and all those
[1:25:36] things down there and you know made
[1:25:38] mistakes and God had to come down
[1:25:40] himself and that's predestination you
[1:25:42] know come down and you know get him out
[1:25:44] of there and say to that King no don't
[1:25:46] go take he can't had that woman and he's
[1:25:48] he's my prophet and he's gonna pray for
[1:25:51] you and you know he's confused
[1:25:54] and but that's that was but over and if
[1:25:57] you read in Hebrews 11 Abraham never
[1:26:00] made a mistake he was perfect in all his
[1:26:03] ways face upon the earth and the father
[1:26:06] of the faithful
[1:26:08] so just God rich in mercy so in in that
[1:26:21] so after all that and there's it could
[1:26:24] be more added I'm sure but we know that
[1:26:28] the Holy Spirit is there to as a as a
[1:26:30] mission to guide us we read it in
[1:26:32] Ezekiel 36 when he's and the God is
[1:26:36] going to come down and do what he has to
[1:26:38] do in order to bring bring up plan of
[1:26:41] redemption to bring his family back
[1:26:42] together with him in a new land right as
[1:26:45] we read there and that's what's
[1:26:47] happening right now and it's right at
[1:26:49] the end of it so so here so just finish
[1:26:53] under and the blood brother Brennan
[1:26:55] talked about that that the experience he
[1:26:59] had with the cafeteria on a Sunday
[1:27:01] morning and he walked into it and he saw
[1:27:03] corruption what was going on in there
[1:27:05] and the woman and etc etc and and he was
[1:27:09] he was you know he was grieved by it and
[1:27:15] he he was said to God you know you know
[1:27:18] how long are we gonna put up with this
[1:27:20] why don't you come down and just
[1:27:22] eliminate it all and and the Holy Spirit
[1:27:25] was was great and called him in behind
[1:27:27] the door and he said and he showed him
[1:27:30] he showed him that bumper that bumper of
[1:27:32] blood that was around the earth right so
[1:27:35] this is this is too great this is Grace
[1:27:37] for our age because we're in the we're
[1:27:42] in the in the age of Pentecost under
[1:27:44] that under the Jewish law it was seven
[1:27:49] times seven the forty forty nine weeks
[1:27:52] that they did but with us it was the
[1:27:54] ages - it's a seven ages and were under
[1:27:57] this this blood so there's a so before
[1:28:00] before that that this this was if
[1:28:03] someone wasn't under the the blood of
[1:28:05] the bulls and goats they could be judged
[1:28:08] but under this blood that that God has
[1:28:10] put in from Calvary it's all sort of
[1:28:13] wood and all over the world and it's
[1:28:16] grace
[1:28:16] so people people can do things in sin
[1:28:19] and whatever and there's no judgment
[1:28:21] there's a judgment to follow but there's
[1:28:24] there's grace inside on the earth now
[1:28:27] because of Calvary Acts John 3:16 for
[1:28:31] God so loved the world so that is Grace
[1:28:34] and we know the grace is waning it's
[1:28:37] starting to pull away from the earth now
[1:28:38] because we're over there the 7 times 7
[1:28:41] now rather than 7 Church ages and the
[1:28:44] and the 17 is really it see you know
[1:28:47] it's the age of Pentecost really you
[1:28:49] know is the Pentecostal age and and and
[1:28:52] now we're you know it's broke up into -
[1:28:54] really - Pentecost Asia and the bride
[1:28:55] age which is the last part of the seven
[1:28:57] days but in here if a person if a person
[1:29:01] in here sins they do really they're
[1:29:04] really they're not judged at the time
[1:29:06] they they they're not born again or
[1:29:09] whatever or if they you know they're not
[1:29:11] you know on there but they're still
[1:29:14] under the blood per se and if they if
[1:29:17] they leave that if they died here and
[1:29:20] went into the ground when they when they
[1:29:22] come up before God they will come out of
[1:29:25] it once they come out of this out of
[1:29:27] this dimension here and into the other
[1:29:29] dimension dimension of the lost they
[1:29:32] will have all that was on them going in
[1:29:34] to face a judge and angry God they will
[1:29:37] have that right now if you're a believer
[1:29:39] here and you and you've you're under the
[1:29:42] blood you claim the blood like that when
[1:29:44] you cross this blood line in here you
[1:29:46] will go to the sixth dimension and
[1:29:48] you'll be covered by the blood and
[1:29:50] you'll have nothing nothing to be judged
[1:29:52] by as a bride of Jesus Christ so all of
[1:29:55] that will be absolved from you because
[1:29:57] you claimed it and it was washed away
[1:29:59] and you received the Holy Ghost so you
[1:30:02] can pass from this life into the next
[1:30:04] dimension and you'll be covered you'll
[1:30:06] be in a place of rest a place worth God
[1:30:11] god abides me so that that will that
[1:30:14] will happen but not for the unbeliever
[1:30:16] because that bumper of blood is still
[1:30:18] there for them right
[1:30:20] and then it'll it'll be there but you
[1:30:23] notice now you'll see more and more you
[1:30:26] know where your see God is and it's just
[1:30:29] going into his his judgment the part of
[1:30:32] this judgment so that's the so that's
[1:30:35] what brother Branham saw and when he
[1:30:37] when he saw that and he saw that Christ
[1:30:39] was was there you know for the
[1:30:44] forgiveness of sins and for that woman
[1:30:45] that was there you know and for what he
[1:30:47] said and for what that woman said Christ
[1:30:50] took all of those sins so you can't
[1:30:53] condemn anybody Christ don't condemn
[1:30:54] them so you can't right and there is
[1:30:59] coming a time when they will be
[1:31:01] condemned you know they will be before
[1:31:04] and judged and whatever you know it's
[1:31:06] like brother Lonnie said there and in
[1:31:08] the message that you know that there
[1:31:11] will be answer for what they did in for
[1:31:14] the spirit that controlled him right
[1:31:15] today that hit they'll have to face that
[1:31:18] at some point because we know that the
[1:31:21] picture of the cloud there is a picture
[1:31:24] you know of a judge you know coming into
[1:31:27] a judge there with the white beard and
[1:31:30] the white wait here and everything it's
[1:31:32] a judge no longer a priest we're in the
[1:31:36] cemetery changes in Revelation one you
[1:31:38] seem with the with the cloth around him
[1:31:42] like a priest so that that now is
[1:31:45] passing because you know it with with
[1:31:47] seven you know all through revelation as
[1:31:50] seven is his completion and when Jesus
[1:31:55] on a cross he said it was finished that
[1:31:57] part was finished but it wasn't all
[1:31:58] finished because he went he went he did
[1:32:01] his thing you know he went to to the
[1:32:04] souls in prison and you know they were
[1:32:07] waiting for that appoint on Calvary and
[1:32:09] then they were released they had
[1:32:11] received a blood sacrifice they release
[1:32:14] and went with with God and be and and
[1:32:16] before that he went as an and that's
[1:32:19] right he went and raised from the dead
[1:32:22] and he went into heaven and presented as
[1:32:25] sacrifice which would be the atonement
[1:32:26] for the sins just as soon as the high
[1:32:28] priest would go to the Holy of Holies he
[1:32:31] on a yearly basis he did that once for
[1:32:33] all
[1:32:33] we read that in Hebrews so that was done
[1:32:35] and then he came back down anything ate
[1:32:37] and everything but before he couldn't
[1:32:38] touch him because he was he was
[1:32:40] narrating could not be defiled by
[1:32:42] someone human and had to do that so but
[1:32:45] once he did that he came down eight and
[1:32:47] then he fellowship there with the Saints
[1:32:48] for so many days right and then he went
[1:32:50] went back he became he took under then
[1:32:53] the role of the Son of God and came back
[1:32:56] and living in his in his his children
[1:33:03] those that were his family
[1:33:05] those were destinated who had the seed
[1:33:07] life of God so we talked about before
[1:33:10] with the with the token and we know that
[1:33:14] in the in the first three ages you know
[1:33:16] it was continually declining as they as
[1:33:21] the really the first three ages were a
[1:33:25] lot based on the teachings of Paul and
[1:33:27] they started to slip away and the devil
[1:33:30] was moving in and mix him with the word
[1:33:32] and then funny and it opened Pergamus
[1:33:34] where they ended up with a trinity of
[1:33:37] god's and lost the name of god they lost
[1:33:39] the name of God then it was the most
[1:33:41] precious thing but they lost it and so
[1:33:45] then in the fourth age we know that if
[1:33:47] went into you know it went into almost
[1:33:50] disappeared off the earth but it was
[1:33:52] just safe barely it was the longest age
[1:33:53] but it was the time they they were in
[1:33:57] this age where the Catholic Church was
[1:33:59] coming you know in the power and the
[1:34:02] Pope and all of this was getting set up
[1:34:03] in that age and it was a terrific time
[1:34:06] for the church the truth are almost you
[1:34:09] know was it was but only by grace that
[1:34:11] it wasn't just eliminated from the earth
[1:34:13] but it it wasn't and the corner corner
[1:34:16] took the seat had to go back into the
[1:34:18] ground and come back in again which it
[1:34:20] did in Luther so we see now Luther
[1:34:22] coming back here Luther was coming back
[1:34:25] my brother Brennan was said it was a
[1:34:27] sprig a sprig that came up and the word
[1:34:32] was starting to be restored again
[1:34:33] through this age of reformation and then
[1:34:36] and as we talked about last time in the
[1:34:38] token you know the Luther received the
[1:34:41] Holy Ghost and and he received the Holy
[1:34:45] Ghost and the gift
[1:34:46] and just under justification and they
[1:34:49] had that revelation of justification but
[1:34:51] then you know there was a lot of things
[1:34:53] that still had to come and he was
[1:34:55] covered by the blood because he still
[1:34:57] did things that were in today you just
[1:34:59] couldn't do right you know he's so drank
[1:35:02] and smoked and he believed in the
[1:35:04] annihilation of the Jews and all you
[1:35:06] know so there was a blood covering form
[1:35:08] the blood had to cover for that for him
[1:35:11] and then came along the next day
[1:35:13] revealed more and it was in the
[1:35:15] Philadelphia age and it was
[1:35:17] sanctification and that was it there was
[1:35:21] more revealed justification and
[1:35:23] sanctification now for for Wesley and it
[1:35:27] was you know we're still no different
[1:35:29] than the Holy Ghost you know because you
[1:35:31] know how do you get the Holy Ghost well
[1:35:33] you know Luther's saying you know I'm
[1:35:35] justified well how do I know you're just
[1:35:36] fine you know I mean how do how do you
[1:35:38] know you're saying you know it's it's
[1:35:40] one of those it's a spiritual thing but
[1:35:43] then there was things that Wesley had to
[1:35:45] the cover but they had they were given
[1:35:48] given gifts here and the blood had there
[1:35:51] was less to cover with the blood but the
[1:35:53] blood had to cover because he still
[1:35:55] believed in a Trinity and all of those
[1:35:56] things right and then there was the next
[1:35:59] came up was the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:01] Spirit and the gifts that came up in the
[1:36:04] Pentecostal age in this age because now
[1:36:07] we're starting to see an open door here
[1:36:09] at the end of the at the end of the
[1:36:11] Wesley age going into this age and which
[1:36:13] reveal again the name once more started
[1:36:16] to get again and and people were sent to
[1:36:19] baptize them in the name in that soul so
[1:36:22] here where it was almost lost down here
[1:36:24] it was certainly come open brother
[1:36:27] mentioned your name you know that
[1:36:29] scripture where it talks about the
[1:36:30] opening door the door opening up in that
[1:36:33] age into the last age where the name
[1:36:35] again would be revealed so then there
[1:36:38] was there was still more things that had
[1:36:40] to be covered by the blood because this
[1:36:44] wasn't exactly if if we remember that
[1:36:47] you know Wesley came up and was these
[1:36:50] leaves of the wheat plant and then there
[1:36:54] was more came up and then we in
[1:36:56] Pentecost it was the husk but it's still
[1:36:57] not the same
[1:36:59] that was planted here is not in the
[1:37:01] green right here we're still not at this
[1:37:03] grain age so God would God would give
[1:37:06] these things as a token you know you had
[1:37:09] to be justified that was a token back
[1:37:11] then right in what in Wesley it was a
[1:37:13] token that sanctification and God gave
[1:37:16] to give the giver gave that gift into
[1:37:19] that group so that they could be saved
[1:37:21] you don't I think we gathered that they
[1:37:23] could receive the Holy Ghost and in the
[1:37:25] last age now and Pentecost thought they
[1:37:28] had it they thought they had it you know
[1:37:31] and they and realized after they didn't
[1:37:34] and in the last age it was a grain age
[1:37:37] we see the seed age is where now after
[1:37:41] the planting the seed came up and it's
[1:37:43] identical to what was planted here
[1:37:45] wasn't see it wasn't identical and it
[1:37:48] had to be covered by the blood how they
[1:37:49] lived and everything wasn't the same
[1:37:51] what they believed wasn't the same as
[1:37:53] what went into the ground right it had
[1:37:56] to be the grain I mean and here so there
[1:37:59] was less of the blood you still lose
[1:38:01] some of the blood because you're you're
[1:38:03] in the flesh but what happened here it
[1:38:05] wasn't to give her given a gift now it
[1:38:08] was the giver had come in because it was
[1:38:11] back to grain again so and that's the
[1:38:13] token that's what brother brian says
[1:38:16] that's the most important thing is now
[1:38:18] he's getting ready for the last last the
[1:38:22] last event in the in the church now
[1:38:23] which is the resurrection and in rapture
[1:38:26] I were looking for a rapture yes but
[1:38:28] we're looking for a resurrection first
[1:38:29] right the Saints gotta rise first and
[1:38:32] then we see the rapture so now in this
[1:38:35] just to finish up that there you know we
[1:38:38] were talking about the token but the
[1:38:39] token now is to give her right here the
[1:38:44] giver was given a gift or perb and says
[1:38:46] you got to have the Holy Ghost but they
[1:38:48] had the Holy Ghost you know how does
[1:38:50] that work right but it was just a part
[1:38:52] of him because in because we know that
[1:38:54] the we know that in the seven church
[1:38:57] ages Dewar's the seven spirits of God
[1:38:59] and each age had a spirit but in the
[1:39:03] last age when this came all the seven
[1:39:06] spirits were back into one
[1:39:09] right so now it was divided here the son
[1:39:12] of man was here he went up into heaven
[1:39:15] and now it was split up into seven seven
[1:39:18] spirits and we see it in the seven
[1:39:20] church ages right the seven spirits
[1:39:22] before God in the in Revelation one and
[1:39:25] now they all came back in this last age
[1:39:28] and now it was the son of man again son
[1:39:31] of man again in in in all those seven
[1:39:34] spirits all in one back in this age
[1:39:37] wonderful time and that was the token
[1:39:40] now it was the full spirit the Holy
[1:39:44] Spirit the the same seed that went in
[1:39:46] and was at the beginning now is in the
[1:39:49] bride again so when we look at it when
[1:39:54] we look at it and I think what's getting
[1:39:59] revealed here I'm only only just going
[1:40:02] going here just so when when the seals
[1:40:06] came he came to the first seal the
[1:40:08] second seal third seal and there was a
[1:40:10] symbol here so over here you know you
[1:40:13] had a you know the third seal you see a
[1:40:15] balance you know you know you see a
[1:40:18] balance here and it talked about what
[1:40:22] this was in Burma and explain what that
[1:40:24] was the balance you know like in in that
[1:40:27] age and and you see the the different
[1:40:30] the the beasts here in the in this third
[1:40:34] seal you know you see the here the horse
[1:40:38] rider and you see the ox and the man in
[1:40:44] the in this age and the eagle in the
[1:40:47] fourth seal right and then you see the
[1:40:50] beasts coming here you know the horse
[1:40:52] riders coming through here and it and it
[1:40:55] gives you something to explain it he was
[1:40:58] talking about what this meant what this
[1:40:59] man and give me a revelation but by
[1:41:02] explaining but when he came to the
[1:41:04] seventh seal and a seventh seal here's
[1:41:09] what the it says in Revelation 8 1 that
[1:41:13] there was silence in heaven for a half
[1:41:14] an hour right so this is what hears we
[1:41:19] now here's the symbols for the seventh
[1:41:22] seal
[1:41:23] this is it nothing he never gave you
[1:41:27] anything
[1:41:27] there's nowhere in there in in the Bible
[1:41:30] and you know program is a bit worried
[1:41:33] too you know going into this Seventh
[1:41:35] Seal what what there's but as we see now
[1:41:38] you know he it was gonna start like
[1:41:41] everything manifests itself eventually
[1:41:43] it wasn't gonna be any hint to it at all
[1:41:46] because there was gonna be nothing
[1:41:47] physical anymore
[1:41:48] there was nothing physical or no ham
[1:41:50] it's all gonna happen inside a people
[1:41:52] you know so don't look for this this and
[1:41:55] this to happen
[1:41:57] it's all going to happen inside you so
[1:42:00] so it's revealed that that Christ you
[1:42:03] know in the seventh seal Christ would
[1:42:05] not come back he would come back but he
[1:42:08] would be same as Ezekiel 36 he would
[1:42:11] come back in a people yeah right and
[1:42:13] this is the full second master second
[1:42:17] appearing of Christ in a people so all
[1:42:20] the people will see here is a is a group
[1:42:23] of people that we will call the bride
[1:42:25] and he he changed it from church because
[1:42:28] he changed his names he changed Saul
[1:42:30] appalled he changed his from church to
[1:42:32] bride why did he change it from because
[1:42:35] they rejected it the church rejected it
[1:42:37] and he calls the bride which is to mrs.
[1:42:39] Jesus Christ so what will be manifested
[1:42:41] in the last age is not Christ coming
[1:42:43] back see in the first in in the end of
[1:42:46] the Old Covenant in the Old Testament
[1:42:49] you know all of these things that were
[1:42:52] stunning the prophets and the people was
[1:42:54] shown who who God was like Moses he was
[1:42:58] delivering and Christ would be the
[1:43:00] deliverer and it was the Spirit of
[1:43:01] Christ in Moses to deliver the people
[1:43:04] and they know that story inside out they
[1:43:06] know that and it showed all of these
[1:43:08] things all up to the prophets and then
[1:43:10] in so in the last time you know the
[1:43:13] angel comes to Mary and he says you know
[1:43:17] you're gonna be with child and God does
[1:43:20] it all himself this the blood cell and
[1:43:23] the egg and all of it is him is still
[1:43:26] going to be a man because you know Mary
[1:43:28] eats and he's gonna just like Kimberly
[1:43:30] now at the more she eats that baby is
[1:43:32] forming it was a it was flesh man right
[1:43:35] was gonna had the blood of God and the
[1:43:37] Spirit of God with no sin nature it
[1:43:40] didn't have the flesh that you or I
[1:43:42] would have that would come through the
[1:43:45] woman the same way because the woman had
[1:43:46] nothing to do with it Mary had nothing
[1:43:47] to do with her it was all gone but it
[1:43:50] had to be a man and Jesus was a hundred
[1:43:52] percent God and a hundred cent man how
[1:43:55] can it be a hundred seven hundred cent
[1:43:56] it's a paradox you know but he was he
[1:43:59] was he could he could feel he couldn't
[1:44:01] sin but he could feel everything you
[1:44:03] know he had emotions and he could be sad
[1:44:05] it could cry and all of those things but
[1:44:07] still he could you know race a dead you
[1:44:10] know and only God can do that right
[1:44:12] where Brian never did it he just said
[1:44:14] there if anyone says they got healing
[1:44:16] power in Christ he said that's a lie you
[1:44:19] know it's only there's only one that
[1:44:20] could do that right so when when he when
[1:44:24] he grew up and he went to the you know
[1:44:27] he went to the to be baptized by John
[1:44:30] the Holy Spirit came down on him right
[1:44:32] the Spirit of God that started his work
[1:44:34] there and he and then so he went up to
[1:44:38] the Pharisees and he said voila you know
[1:44:43] and they he said I am I'm him I'm his he
[1:44:50] killed I'm I'm a Isaiah 53 and they said
[1:44:55] no you're not you know they rejected it
[1:44:58] they didn't accept it at all the whole
[1:45:01] thing was rejected you know so and now
[1:45:05] and now we're in the same point again
[1:45:06] we're in at the end of the second age
[1:45:09] and they're all waiting for Christ to
[1:45:12] come just like that just like he went up
[1:45:14] to the Pharisees and he stood up and
[1:45:17] he's gonna go to the church leaders or
[1:45:19] whatever in saying you know Here I am we
[1:45:23] were expecting it let's go and it's not
[1:45:26] going to happen like that he's not going
[1:45:27] to show at all like that at all when he
[1:45:30] shows himself in Revelation 19 they will
[1:45:33] will not want to see him you know it's
[1:45:36] too late so we so in this age because of
[1:45:39] the the bride and the bridegroom now it
[1:45:43] was God's whole plan if we see it in
[1:45:45] Christ the mystery God revealed you know
[1:45:48] he just
[1:45:49] expand it out from the southern seal and
[1:45:50] said here's the three things that I'm
[1:45:52] gonna do in this last age and it had to
[1:45:55] do with the bride and the bridegroom
[1:45:56] going back to - bringing it all back to
[1:46:00] the Garden of Eden and the Millennium is
[1:46:01] the Garden of Eden back again so like I
[1:46:05] said you get your title deed and you get
[1:46:06] the earnest and the Holy Ghost
[1:46:08] then it's all don't it is all done right
[1:46:11] now except for the body so that we would
[1:46:13] know the body so you say well you know
[1:46:16] it's all finished well I'm selling this
[1:46:18] body but that's just a plan for that
[1:46:20] you know it's a plan and it's coming
[1:46:22] very close because you know when you
[1:46:25] look at the plant when you look at the
[1:46:27] plant here you know when it comes to if
[1:46:30] you look at any plant
[1:46:31] you cannot leave that there forever you
[1:46:33] know a fruit on the plant it's gonna rot
[1:46:35] and and it can trot so we're right up
[1:46:39] past the husk and this you know it's
[1:46:44] it's now ripening its ripening right now
[1:46:48] so it has to end soon everything has to
[1:46:50] end soon because you cannot let that
[1:46:52] prove rot on the vine you know whatever
[1:46:55] it is it can't it is it's a natural
[1:46:58] thing we don't know when it is you know
[1:47:00] is it it has to do with the the
[1:47:03] perfection and the sons of God and when
[1:47:06] they come perfection and maturity
[1:47:08] because we know we're not babies anymore
[1:47:10] here now we're at the end now he's
[1:47:12] marrying a bride it hasn't been mature
[1:47:14] person you know someone like Christ is
[1:47:17] not going to marry a bay a young girl
[1:47:20] you know it's going to marry a mature
[1:47:22] bride right so it has to be what we're
[1:47:25] we're that close it we have to be coming
[1:47:27] to maturity whatever God calls that
[1:47:29] maturity or adoption of songs you know
[1:47:31] we where we get the power we get the
[1:47:34] power you know that the name of the tech
[1:47:38] is as good as the father's right so we
[1:47:41] come to that spot and brother Branham
[1:47:43] came to that spot because he was you
[1:47:45] know as Christ in him was the wave
[1:47:47] offering because he could brother Brian
[1:47:49] could step up and say you know let her
[1:47:54] squirrel be there right that is that so
[1:47:57] he his name was just as good on a check
[1:47:59] he say
[1:48:00] he'd say I want a squirrel to be created
[1:48:04] and he rates it out and signs it and God
[1:48:06] does it here's this world so the
[1:48:09] maturity is there you know the wave
[1:48:11] offering is there we know is going to
[1:48:12] come because we've seen that
[1:48:14] manifestation of the of the sons of God
[1:48:16] right there in that man and he said just
[1:48:18] before he left in communion just a
[1:48:21] couple of paragraphs his last words on
[1:48:24] the earth he said I realized I'm not the
[1:48:26] son of of Charles and ellebra no you
[1:48:30] know he says I'm not that anymore he
[1:48:32] says that was this God he said I've
[1:48:35] moved you know and recognize that now
[1:48:38] I'm a son of God I'm not gonna have any
[1:48:40] of that flesh left or anything like that
[1:48:42] I'm gonna be a true son and daughter
[1:48:43] gone which was Ezekiel 36 you know was
[1:48:48] he was going to come into those people
[1:48:50] and do sanctify them and he was going to
[1:48:53] bring them and fulfill the plan of
[1:48:56] redemption and bring all those people
[1:48:58] back into his family together with him
[1:49:01] in a new land and that's what we've come
[1:49:04] to you know and you know we just have to
[1:49:07] be so close so you know the name of God
[1:49:11] was restored the name of God I was
[1:49:13] taught about the seven seals so here is
[1:49:15] the seventh seal there's nothing so now
[1:49:18] it's he wouldn't say it you know he
[1:49:21] wouldn't like he you know the angel said
[1:49:23] you know you fooled it up you know you
[1:49:29] first pull second Pole you know you're
[1:49:32] told how it worked and you know it all
[1:49:35] up you know if you read in why we're so
[1:49:39] tossed about when he was fishing and he
[1:49:41] came to him in the turbine and they told
[1:49:42] him you know like the first pole in the
[1:49:45] second pole and you know it's like you
[1:49:48] you can't go saying how how it works
[1:49:51] right and he wouldn't do it in this in
[1:49:53] the seventh seal and when the third pole
[1:49:55] was being revealed he said he it was
[1:50:00] happening but he wouldn't say how it was
[1:50:02] going to be done it was you know and it
[1:50:04] was the revealing of the word and these
[1:50:05] these things that were going to happen
[1:50:07] and what it was it was going to be that
[1:50:09] that bridegroom in the bride
[1:50:13] United together and the manifestation of
[1:50:16] any change and the name was changed and
[1:50:19] the manifestation of Christ is going to
[1:50:23] be the bride on the earth and that's
[1:50:25] what they will see in the last days they
[1:50:27] will never see Christ because brother
[1:50:29] Brian says you only see Jesus in the in
[1:50:33] the first in the first three chapters
[1:50:36] I need no see until revelation 19 and
[1:50:39] people say when he comes down with the
[1:50:40] Saints in Revelation 19 at the end of
[1:50:43] the Armageddon but well how about
[1:50:45] Revelation 10 with Revelation 10 no
[1:50:47] spiritual Baran was referring to
[1:50:50] physical the physic they saw Jesus
[1:50:52] physically here and they saw him in 19
[1:50:55] they'll see him physically there in the
[1:50:56] body but in this in this in Revelation
[1:50:59] 10 he he's there spiritually and
[1:51:03] bringing in it really is the bride age
[1:51:05] is the seventh seal it's all of us
[1:51:07] coming together in the end
[1:51:09] right so it's all manifesting now now
[1:51:12] I'll just read it because I think just
[1:51:14] to finish up here so it so this is this
[1:51:22] is so this is this is questions and
[1:51:27] answers in the seals it's just before
[1:51:31] the Seventh Seal there's really just a
[1:51:34] few quotes here the show people were so
[1:51:40] going into the seventh seal eight when
[1:51:42] one day the first second took six days
[1:51:45] and this is Sunday morning just before
[1:51:48] the Seventh Seal and they were worked up
[1:51:50] and brother brother brother brother knew
[1:51:52] it and he knew this is you know your
[1:51:55] tinnitus this is what you're gonna get
[1:51:58] yeah nothing you know because it's gonna
[1:52:01] take a little time it took time for
[1:52:02] brother Branham you know he preached him
[1:52:05] attraction under a mountain and he was
[1:52:07] saying I just saw that for the first
[1:52:08] time and you know so it took a little
[1:52:10] time you know for all of this to
[1:52:11] manifest because God was gonna do it and
[1:52:14] and here's what he told the people
[1:52:16] before and I think it's what reading
[1:52:18] because you know we have to take heed of
[1:52:19] herself because so many people try to
[1:52:21] figure it out they came up with things
[1:52:22] and but it was never meant to be like
[1:52:25] that like
[1:52:27] and all of your conscious to know that
[1:52:29] there's something mysterious happening
[1:52:31] and it's happening and I know what it is
[1:52:33] and I'm not saying that it's the grace
[1:52:36] of God that lets me know that what it is
[1:52:38] it's something that's tremendous and
[1:52:40] it's gone right right now and there's
[1:52:43] not a way in the world for you to see it
[1:52:45] but so help me with the Bible on my hand
[1:52:48] I know what it is it's been told to you
[1:52:50] before you don't try to put any
[1:52:52] interpretation but just believe me as
[1:52:54] your brother we're living in a great
[1:52:56] hour and a mint this is a great hour
[1:53:00] this is the fulfillment verse 14 and
[1:53:04] well you just be real humble here's what
[1:53:07] we Israeli told us to do be real humble
[1:53:10] be a Christian try to live for God and
[1:53:13] live honest with your fellow man I love
[1:53:17] those who don't love you and you only
[1:53:20] make it a mysterious something and mess
[1:53:22] the whole program of God up and and they
[1:53:25] messed it up it got messed up they came
[1:53:29] up with everything you know ever since
[1:53:33] ever since March March March 24th 1963
[1:53:41] they messed it up yesterday afternoon
[1:53:45] something happened in my room that I'll
[1:53:46] never be able to leave it you see and
[1:53:49] about two weeks ago something happened
[1:53:50] they'll never be able to as long as I
[1:53:52] live on that's just I'll never be able
[1:53:54] to get away from it so it's at verse 6
[1:53:57] 16 I read 60 and so the church you're
[1:54:01] not supposed to know these things so
[1:54:03] don't put no interpretation to any
[1:54:05] anything you just go ahead and just
[1:54:07] remember what you're told live a
[1:54:09] Christian life go to your church be a
[1:54:12] real light wherever you are and just
[1:54:14] burn for Christ and tell the people that
[1:54:17] how you love him and just let your
[1:54:20] testimony he would love all the time
[1:54:22] with the people because if you don't you
[1:54:24] twist yourself out into something there
[1:54:26] and you're off the beaten track every
[1:54:29] time you try to do it you've done that
[1:54:31] so just don't try to make no
[1:54:33] interpretation especially tonight when
[1:54:35] that when that seal becomes up up in
[1:54:38] front of you
[1:54:39] just don't try to interpret it just go
[1:54:41] ahead and just be humble and go right on
[1:54:44] with the same plain message and he's
[1:54:47] saying God is gonna do this there's no
[1:54:49] one's gonna do this this is all gonna
[1:54:51] and it's not gonna be in the physical
[1:54:53] you know it's gonna be in the spiritual
[1:54:55] it's gonna be in a people and we know
[1:54:57] that now it's gonna be in abroad so just
[1:55:01] don't interpret anything if God wants
[1:55:04] you to know anything he will send it to
[1:55:06] you that's very important if you want
[1:55:07] you to when he needs you to know he'll
[1:55:09] we're usually when it's interpreted
[1:55:11] right that it will be sent to you and it
[1:55:15] would be revealed to you but what you
[1:55:16] need will be sent to you so just be real
[1:55:19] real solid now whole still something has
[1:55:21] happened you understand what I mean
[1:55:23] don't you know they didn't if you can
[1:55:26] understand it this is the third pole you
[1:55:28] should have caught that the other day
[1:55:30] and you remember it there'll be no
[1:55:32] impersonation like there was of the
[1:55:34] other two so he's just a just warmin
[1:55:37] warning them so you know everything and
[1:55:45] everything was just you know gonna
[1:55:48] happen but there was nothing we could do
[1:55:50] to make it happen there's nothing you
[1:55:52] can do to stop it you're saying do what
[1:55:54] come here we do to something what could
[1:55:56] she done no I'm not doing it you know
[1:55:58] that didn't work didn't work for John
[1:56:00] the Baptist father right he was struck
[1:56:03] dumb you know and said you're gonna
[1:56:05] you're gonna do it so so what some it's
[1:56:10] it's just whatever we need is gonna be
[1:56:13] sent to us and all of this will be
[1:56:15] fulfilled but we know that they've made
[1:56:18] a mess of it but it still it didn't make
[1:56:20] no difference to God
[1:56:22] what what he needed he sent to us and
[1:56:25] what we're gonna need he's gonna send to
[1:56:28] us and it's all gonna happen in the end
[1:56:30] and his people will be redeemed and he
[1:56:32] will be in his people and sanctified and
[1:56:34] his and the name of God and as it is in
[1:56:40] in here and the name of God it shows how
[1:56:44] important it is and he said they
[1:56:46] profaned my my holy name my holy name
[1:56:49] and I will sanctify in verse 23 of
[1:56:51] Ezekiel 37 I was
[1:56:53] act upon my great name which was which
[1:56:55] was profaned among the heathen which he
[1:56:58] had profaned in the midst of them and
[1:57:00] the heathen shall know that i am the
[1:57:01] lord when i shall be sanctified in you
[1:57:04] before his eyes and this coal i don't
[1:57:07] have it here but i'll read it it's out
[1:57:09] of god's when he provide a place of
[1:57:10] worship and the name is in the word
[1:57:13] because he is the word and amen to that
[1:57:17] amen what what is he then this is what
[1:57:20] is he then
[1:57:21] he said the word interpreted is the
[1:57:23] manifestation of the nail of God flesh
[1:57:27] and blood has not revealed this to you
[1:57:28] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:57:30] revealed this to you who I am and upon
[1:57:32] this rock I'll build my place of worship
[1:57:34] and the gates of Hell can shake it down
[1:57:36] amen all living Church of God
[1:57:39] standing firm foundation of Jesus Christ
[1:57:42] alone he can sing the song but if you're
[1:57:45] not on the Christ a word you're on teeth
[1:57:50] teetering faltering sand but upon this
[1:57:53] rock Christ Christ my word so he says
[1:57:57] the word interpretation is the
[1:57:59] manifestation of the name of God the
[1:58:02] name of God to be honored and the name
[1:58:04] is very important and this one last one
[1:58:06] here I actually call the coffee gave me
[1:58:11] this one and if you're baptized any
[1:58:14] other way but in the name of Jesus
[1:58:17] Christ
[1:58:18] it's an adultery baptism which is not
[1:58:20] found in the Bible so what what you do
[1:58:23] in word and deed do do it all in the
[1:58:26] name of Jesus after that what you do but
[1:58:31] first you have to come in his name Amen
[1:58:36] the name is important the name is
[1:58:39] everything the name is is it's what
[1:58:42] glorifies glorifies God Amen Lord bless
[1:58:47] you let's stand and we'll sing that song
[1:58:51] I think I wrote it down because he sang
[1:58:55] it my sins are washed away setting the
[1:58:58] title of it I'm amazed that was really
[1:59:01] nice amen bless you
