[38:35] into your word Lord may we just rest on
[38:37] a solid foundation of your scriptures
[38:39] Lord to know where we are to know who we
[38:41] are Lord to know what you're doing in
[38:43] our lives each one Lord bless us each
[38:46] one we pray Lord grant us Grace for this
[38:48] service now in Jesus Christ's name amen
[38:52] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[38:53] Galatians chapter 4 Galatians chapter 4
[38:56] amen want to welcome brother Bob back
[38:59] from his momentary sickness it's good to
[39:02] see him back he certainly bounced back
[39:03] faster than the rest of us I think so we
[39:05] thank the Lord for that good to have
[39:07] sister Selena back as well from BC and
[39:10] then suddenly the Mac coffees just
[39:12] sprouted so many young women and last
[39:16] service we had two and now we've got
[39:18] like 93 in the two front rows so God
[39:20] bless you each one it's good to have all
[39:22] of our visitors and then trust that
[39:24] you'll be blessed in your in your time
[39:26] with us each one amen God bless you
[39:29] Galatians chapter 4 says this now I say
[39:31] that the heir as long as he is a child
[39:34] differeth nothing from a servant though
[39:37] he be Lord of all but is under tutors
[39:39] and governors until the time appointed
[39:41] of the father even so we when we were
[39:44] children were in bondage under the
[39:46] elements of the world but when the
[39:49] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[39:52] his son made of a woman made under the
[39:55] law to redeem them that were under the
[39:57] law that we might receive the adoption
[40:00] of sons and because ye are Sons God has
[40:03] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[40:05] your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore
[40:08] Thou Art no more a servant but a son and
[40:10] if a son then an heir of God through
[40:13] Christ amen God bless you you can have
[40:15] your seats and I'm sure some of you are
[40:17] sitting there in some confusion and
[40:19] saying brother John you said we were
[40:20] done with adoption and you open up with
[40:22] an adoption scripture and the simple
[40:24] fact is we are done with the series on
[40:26] adoption but but there's so many things
[40:28] in Scripture that tie into it that you
[40:30] can't get away from these things so this
[40:31] will be much more of a teaching service
[40:33] tonight and probably Sunday if the Lord
[40:35] would will because I'm setting a
[40:37] foundation for a new series that we're
[40:38] starting tonight on the Holy Ghost and I
[40:41] want to call it the token life and I
[40:43] want a subtopic tonight of how the
[40:44] mighty have fallen and you'll see as we
[40:47] get into this you know we we we we
[40:49] started with this scripture in in
[40:51] Galatians because I want us to see we're
[40:53] in a process amen we don't as soon as we
[40:56] get the Holy Ghost that not it that's
[40:58] not doesn't mean we're done but as soon
[41:00] as we are born there's a process that
[41:01] starts if we're children of God and God
[41:03] is in a process of redeeming us back to
[41:06] himself redeeming us back to our
[41:08] original condition redeeming us back to
[41:10] our original position our original
[41:12] inheritance our original place under his
[41:15] leadership and so everything that we're
[41:17] going through is pointing us back to
[41:19] Redemption amen and we know that
[41:21] Redemption is only for those that are in
[41:23] the family bloodline you remember we
[41:25] preached on this I'm not going to preach
[41:26] it all over again tonight but the law of
[41:28] redemption says only someone that's
[41:31] related to you can redeem you and we
[41:33] know what happened in those times was
[41:34] everyone got got an inheritance that's a
[41:37] beautiful thing as a child of God to
[41:38] think tonight you have an inheritance I
[41:40] don't care who you are I don't care what
[41:41] your gender is if you're married if
[41:43] you're old you're young you have an
[41:45] inheritance that God has ordained for
[41:47] you before the foundation of the world
[41:49] now here's the thing we've lost it and
[41:51] in Israel's day maybe they had a
[41:52] drinking problem and they lost their
[41:54] land maybe they fell on Hard Times maybe
[41:56] the enemy came in and took it from them
[41:58] maybe they just H made some unwise
[42:00] decisions and they lost the Family Farm
[42:02] they lost the family inheritance but
[42:04] what could happen was somebody else who
[42:06] had stayed in the way that God had told
[42:08] them to stay that still had their the
[42:11] means and their inheritance with them
[42:12] they could take their money they could
[42:14] take what they had and they could go
[42:16] back and they could buy back what
[42:17] belonged to you and they could give it
[42:19] back to you but that took somebody that
[42:22] was certainly trusting of who you were
[42:24] and that that loved you and appreciated
[42:26] you but as soon as they gave it back to
[42:29] you you had the right to go in and kick
[42:31] off everybody that was on that land as
[42:33] soon as that title deed came back into
[42:36] your hand you had the right to go in and
[42:37] say this this land belongs to me now and
[42:40] they had to leave right then church I'm
[42:42] telling you this evening if you've been
[42:44] purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
[42:46] and you recognize it and you know where
[42:49] your inheritance lies you can go to
[42:51] anybody that comes on your property and
[42:54] say this belongs to me amen it belongs
[42:57] to me and if they choose to stay there
[42:59] you say and you have the right to say in
[43:02] the name of Jesus Christ you must leave
[43:04] this property because he's given it back
[43:07] to me and it belongs to me and I'm
[43:09] taking possession see they don't have to
[43:11] leave if we don't take possession but if
[43:12] we come in to take possession brother
[43:14] Braham says we've got the Holy Ghost as
[43:16] a sheriff to kick it off of our property
[43:19] and to give us back what he said belong
[43:20] to us amen the property comes back to us
[43:23] under Redemption and God said it
[43:25] belonged to them forever it could never
[43:26] go away and that's why he said don't
[43:28] remove the ancient landmarks the ancient
[43:30] Landmark showed where your property
[43:32] started where it ended and everything
[43:34] inside of that belong to you amen and so
[43:37] what happened in this last day they had
[43:39] all of these ancient landmarks when we
[43:40] look at the New Testament Church they
[43:42] had them in the original Church they had
[43:44] signs and wonders they had healings they
[43:45] had the gifts of the Spirit they had all
[43:47] of these things and now we've got people
[43:49] coming in and saying we don't need those
[43:50] now because we've got the word that's
[43:52] part and parcel of the word of God
[43:53] that's part and parcel of the
[43:54] inheritance of Jesus Christ to the bride
[43:56] to today amen it's all a part of ours
[43:59] whatever is in the word brother Bram
[44:00] says I can show you where he put it in
[44:02] you got to show me where he took it out
[44:03] amen every portion of it belongs to us
[44:05] this this evening but I want to take us
[44:07] to our original scripture this evening
[44:09] and I I don't mean to preach I'm hoping
[44:11] to teach tonight but we'll see where it
[44:13] goes amen but it says when God when the
[44:15] fullness of time was come literally this
[44:17] means when God decided it was time God
[44:21] has a time for everything and we can't
[44:23] rush it and we can't stop it we can't
[44:25] slow it down the goal for us is to catch
[44:27] it as he's doing it and that's what a
[44:30] true son and daughter of God does that's
[44:31] what an adopted son and daughter of do
[44:33] God does is they catch the timing of
[44:35] Jesus Christ they catch the timing of
[44:37] the word for their day and so when the
[44:39] time was come when God says it's time
[44:41] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[44:44] made under the law to redeem them that
[44:46] were under the law that we might receive
[44:49] the adoption of sons so Paul saying here
[44:51] look we're in a fallen condition we're
[44:53] not how we used to be and we're not how
[44:55] we ought to be but we're in the this
[44:57] process that's bringing us back and that
[44:59] process is bringing us back to a place
[45:01] called adoption a place where we are
[45:04] true Sons and Daughters of God but for
[45:06] now we're in bondage we're in bondage to
[45:09] these natural bodies we're in bondage to
[45:11] these different things and we knew we
[45:13] didn't live perfect lives we knew we
[45:14] couldn't fulfill the law and so God came
[45:17] in Jesus Christ and he fulfilled the law
[45:20] to give by give living a sinless life
[45:23] amen so what's the benefit now that the
[45:25] law is fulfilled because remember the
[45:27] law had a hold on
[45:28] us excuse me sin had a right to us Satan
[45:31] had a right to us death had a right to
[45:33] us all these things had a right to us
[45:35] under the law because we transgress the
[45:36] law and the penalty for breaking the law
[45:39] is death it's always death and so Satan
[45:42] had a write all of these attributes of
[45:44] Satan and the Fallen condition had a
[45:46] right to us because the law was coming
[45:48] over us and it had a right to us but now
[45:50] Christ comes and he lives a sinless life
[45:52] and he fulfills the law and so what's
[45:55] left now whatever he decides
[45:57] and what does he offer he offers us
[45:59] Mercy he offers us Grace but what
[46:01] happens is when the law is fulfilled
[46:03] that means the price has been paid and
[46:06] now Redemption can proceed because until
[46:08] the price is paid Redemption can't move
[46:09] forward but once the price is paid now
[46:13] everything that has a claim against us
[46:15] has no rights anymore and so the bride
[46:17] is allowed to go the redeemed are
[46:18] allowed to go and they're allowed to
[46:19] take those chains off they're allowed to
[46:21] remove those things from the property
[46:22] that God's given them amen so now Satan
[46:25] doesn't have a claim on us as children
[46:26] of God
[46:27] you got Satan bugging you with something
[46:29] you got demons bothering you you've got
[46:30] sickness it has no right in the life and
[46:33] in the body of a child of God so you've
[46:35] got a right to push it back but this is
[46:37] where overcoming comes in because
[46:39] overcoming means there's a battle
[46:41] there's a battle and that means there's
[46:42] a time and there's an effort amen so now
[46:45] Satan has no right to access so if
[46:46] you've got Satan knocking on your door
[46:48] you've got Satan on your property
[46:50] there's only two reasons one you let him
[46:52] in or two you don't you refuse to kick
[46:53] him out cuz he has no right to be there
[46:56] he's a squad
[46:57] he's a squatter and so the bride of
[46:59] Christ has the authority of Jesus Christ
[47:01] to kick those things off amen but what
[47:04] did Calvary do because that's where
[47:05] that's where the law was fulfilled it
[47:07] was the price was paid at Calvary Christ
[47:10] lived a perfect life and that was him
[47:12] fulfilling the law but now Redemption
[47:14] requires a price and so he goes to
[47:16] Calvary and he pays a price amen and
[47:19] what is it that Calvary means to the
[47:20] believer now we're doing a bible study
[47:23] this morning it'll be 100% scriptures
[47:24] but I'm setting us up with a few things
[47:26] here brother Bram says this he says
[47:28] finally one day that's that day of
[47:31] Calvary he says there was one came down
[47:33] from Glory one by the name of Jesus
[47:35] Christ the son of God who came from
[47:37] glory glory and Calvary was formed that
[47:40] was the day that the price was paid and
[47:43] the sin question was settled forever
[47:46] amen that means that you don't have to
[47:48] wonder am I going or not going because
[47:50] of what I did you're going in because of
[47:53] what he did not because of what you did
[47:54] or didn't do amen it's his perfection
[47:56] that pays the price he says and it
[47:59] opened up the way into this thing that
[48:01] we're hungering and thirsting for it
[48:03] brought a place of satisfaction he says
[48:06] there's no man that's ever visited
[48:08] Calvary and seen it the way it is that
[48:11] can ever be the same everything that he
[48:14] ever desired or longed for is meant when
[48:17] he reaches that place he says it's a
[48:19] place of satisfaction it satisfies the
[48:22] hunger of your heart the hunger of your
[48:23] soul the very hunger of your body it's
[48:26] all men in Calvary if you're a true son
[48:28] or daughter of God but now what happens
[48:31] after the price is paid at Calvary it
[48:33] opens up a way for something what Paul
[48:36] said adoption full Redemption full
[48:39] restoration satisfaction there's
[48:41] something that goes on and he continues
[48:43] in Galatians 4 and he says now because
[48:46] ye are Sons God has sent forth the
[48:48] spirit of his son into your hearts
[48:50] crying Abba Father God only sends the
[48:53] holy spirit for his children that's the
[48:56] only ones that can ever get the Holy
[48:58] Ghost it doesn't mean that you can't
[48:59] feel its its presence its atmosphere its
[49:02] power that doesn't mean it can't come on
[49:04] you but to go into your life you have to
[49:06] be a son or a daughter of God because it
[49:09] comes to the children of God that's the
[49:11] proof that you're a child of God as the
[49:13] Holy Ghost comes to you and it resides
[49:15] in you if you'll accept it he says now
[49:17] if that happens then wherefore Thou Art
[49:19] no more a servant but a son and if a son
[49:22] then an heir of God through Christ so
[49:25] Calvary opens up a way for for us to
[49:27] come back to our our original condition
[49:29] and the means of this or the mechanism
[49:31] for this is the spirit of God it's the
[49:33] Holy Spirit In Our Lives that's the
[49:35] power that's the Dynamics that's what
[49:37] makes all of this possible for us is
[49:39] when the Holy Spirit comes back to the
[49:41] believer and it puts a cry in our hearts
[49:44] amen if you've ever gotten the Holy
[49:45] Ghost you know it puts a cry in your
[49:47] heart to take you out of where you are
[49:49] and put you into what God says you're
[49:50] supposed to be and do in a place you're
[49:53] supposed to rest amen that's why he said
[49:55] you can never truly come to Cal and walk
[49:57] away the same is because if you truly
[49:59] come to Calvary then his Spirit goes
[50:01] from that blood and it comes in and it
[50:03] rests on us
[50:05] amen and then what happens when we
[50:08] realize who we are then it puts that cry
[50:10] and we say father father and we start
[50:12] going to him and saying I'm looking for
[50:14] you to do what you do to Sons I'm
[50:16] looking for you to do what you do to
[50:17] daughters I'm looking for you to change
[50:18] me I'm looking for you to grow me to
[50:20] mature me to to to change me into the
[50:23] image of Christ that we're supposed to
[50:24] be and it starts us on a journey of
[50:27] redemption it's a journey young people
[50:30] it's a journey do not think you have to
[50:32] be perfect from the day you get the Holy
[50:33] Ghost the Perfection is always in Christ
[50:36] it is not in you it is not in me getting
[50:39] the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you are
[50:40] perfect in and of yourself that you'll
[50:42] never make a mistake it has nothing to
[50:44] do with it the Perfection is under the
[50:47] blood of Christ don't ever get it in
[50:49] your head otherwise you turn into a
[50:50] performance-minded Christian and you'll
[50:52] fall and you'll fall and you'll fall and
[50:54] you'll never get up because you're
[50:55] you're beating yourself up up all the
[50:57] time but I want us to look this evening
[51:00] about how did we fall so far so fast
[51:02] because we look at the original and we
[51:04] see that they were Sons and Daughters of
[51:06] God Adam and Eve were a son and a
[51:07] daughter of God and they were in a a
[51:09] perfect place and yet we look at where
[51:11] we are today and I'll tell you one thing
[51:12] we're not in a perfect place by no means
[51:15] are we there so what brought us and
[51:17] that's why we're talking about how the
[51:18] mighty have fallen this evening and I
[51:20] want to talk about the original sin and
[51:22] walk us through these scriptures and and
[51:24] it'll be scriptures from here on out we
[51:26] we preach out of the Bible Church if I
[51:28] can't preach it out of here then I can't
[51:30] preach it from anywhere this is the only
[51:32] source of our inspiration we have a
[51:34] prophet that came and he showed us and
[51:36] he brought us back to the original truth
[51:37] of that scripture but he preached out of
[51:39] this and so I've got to preach out of
[51:40] this the same way so when we come to
[51:42] this original sin we see there's a great
[51:45] deal of confusion and I hope brother
[51:46] Kingsley doesn't mind me mentioning this
[51:48] but we are doing Bible studies with them
[51:50] you know we started a couple years ago
[51:51] and I asked him about what do you think
[51:53] the original sin was and he he just
[51:55] looked at me for a bit and he says you
[51:56] know I really don't know he says I've
[51:58] Heard lots of things but none of it's
[52:00] ever made sense but it's the original
[52:03] sin that caused us to fall and we're
[52:04] talking about the Holy Ghost in this
[52:06] series and the question is why do we
[52:08] need the Holy Ghost why is it the Holy
[52:10] Ghost why is it the Holy Spirit why do
[52:12] we need a new birth what's wrong with
[52:14] our birth that we have why did Eve get
[52:17] to mess it all up for all of us why
[52:18] didn't she just fall by her own decision
[52:20] and I get to be born and and live by my
[52:22] decisions what is it that's caused us to
[52:24] be in this Fallen condition amen now
[52:27] obviously you if you talk to most people
[52:28] in the denominations they'll say well
[52:30] Eve ate a fruit of some sort and then
[52:32] she gave that fruit to Adam and so it
[52:34] was a literal fruit and that's and that
[52:36] was what God told them not to do and so
[52:38] it was sin and so that caused the
[52:40] downfall and and we are where we are
[52:41] today but that's not the case and we
[52:44] ought to know this but I know our young
[52:46] people haven't maybe heard this and this
[52:47] is really the foundation for why we need
[52:49] a new birth why we need the holy ghost
[52:51] in the first place so if we we look in
[52:53] Genesis chap 2 it says this and the Lord
[52:56] planted a garden Eastward in Eden and
[52:59] there he put the man whom he had formed
[53:01] and out of the ground out of the ground
[53:04] the Lord God made the Lord God to grow
[53:06] every tree that is Pleasant to the sight
[53:09] and good for food and the tree of life
[53:12] also in the midst of the garden and the
[53:14] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now
[53:16] somebody would say aha brother John you
[53:18] see he says right there it's a literal
[53:20] tree it's literal fruit it's growing out
[53:22] of the ground but I want you to reread
[53:24] that again because that's not what it
[53:26] says you got to pay close attention to
[53:28] the way that those words are put
[53:29] together because it says and out of the
[53:32] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[53:34] tree every tree that is Pleasant for the
[53:39] sight and good for food and then he puts
[53:41] a semico in there that's a pause that's
[53:43] a
[53:44] break because he says every tree came
[53:48] out of that
[53:49] ground that was good to look at so
[53:51] everything that's beautiful has
[53:52] beautiful flowers and then everything
[53:54] that's good for food so everything you
[53:57] would ever want to eat and that you
[53:58] would want to look at from a plant from
[54:00] a tree all of that was out of the ground
[54:02] and God made it to grow and then he puts
[54:04] a separation here he puts that semicolon
[54:06] there it's a separation of thought it's
[54:08] a separation of species it's a
[54:10] separation of type and then he says and
[54:13] the tree of life
[54:15] also in the midst of the garden and the
[54:18] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so
[54:19] there are trees with with flowers and
[54:21] fruits and these different things all
[54:23] beautiful made for f food made for us to
[54:25] enjoy but but then there's two other
[54:27] trees that are completely separate for
[54:29] those and they're in the midst of the
[54:31] garden it says in the midst of the
[54:33] garden we'll see we want to take note of
[54:35] where they're located in the middle of
[54:37] the garden so I want to ask this evening
[54:40] what are those two
[54:41] trees what are those two trees he says
[54:43] there's a tree of life and he says
[54:45] there's a tree of knowledge of Good and
[54:47] Evil and I and we'll we'll look at that
[54:50] just a moment here as we go through this
[54:51] tonight because we see that after the
[54:53] fall God does something with only one of
[54:56] those trees it says and the Lord God
[54:58] said behold the man has become as one of
[55:01] us to know good and evil and now lest he
[55:04] put forth his hand and take also of the
[55:05] tree of life and eat and live forever
[55:08] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[55:10] from the Garden of Eden to tell the
[55:12] ground from once he was taken so he
[55:14] drove out the man and he placed at the
[55:16] east of the Garden of Eden cherubs and a
[55:19] flaming sword which turned every way to
[55:21] keep the way of the tree of life so God
[55:25] only guarded one of those
[55:27] trees so what happened to the tree of
[55:30] knowledge of Good and Evil because if
[55:32] trees do what trees do then trees
[55:35] reproduce themselves don't they so we
[55:38] see that he guarded the tree of life but
[55:40] nowhere does it say he guarded the tree
[55:41] of knowledge of Good and Evil so if life
[55:44] continued after that and it did because
[55:46] we have all the other trees today where
[55:48] is the tree of knowledge of Good and
[55:49] Evil because if there was one back then
[55:51] then there ought to be hundreds and
[55:53] thousands and millions of them today if
[55:55] they continue to grow because God never
[55:57] protected them God never moved them away
[56:00] God never destroyed them God didn't do
[56:01] anything he left the tree of knowledge
[56:03] of Good and Evil completely untouched so
[56:06] where is it today where can we go and
[56:09] have a bite of the tree of knowledge of
[56:10] Good and Evil we ought to be able to do
[56:12] it if it was a literal
[56:14] tree but we can't why because they
[56:17] weren't literal trees they are
[56:19] representations of something else if we
[56:21] go to Revelation 2:7 we're going from
[56:23] the beginning to the end here now we're
[56:24] going all the way through it says he
[56:26] that ha an ear let him hear what the
[56:27] spirit saith unto the churches to him
[56:30] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[56:32] the tree of life which is in the midst
[56:34] of the paradise of God so now we come to
[56:36] the Ephesian Church age the very first
[56:38] church age this is the one where Paul
[56:40] and the apostles would have been and the
[56:42] promise to the Overcomer is that they
[56:44] get to eat of the Tree of
[56:46] Life how many people do we know that God
[56:49] picked up in that age and transported to
[56:51] Eden past the cherubs and gave them to
[56:54] eat of that tree of life
[56:57] and they never died because that's what
[56:59] Adam and Eve were doing if we believe it
[57:01] it was all literal fruit Adam and Eve
[57:03] were going every day and they were
[57:04] taking a bite of the fruit of eternal
[57:06] life and that would give them life for
[57:07] that day and they would go day by day by
[57:09] day eating this fruit off the tree so
[57:11] who in the Ephesian Church age got to do
[57:13] that no one nobody's been living since
[57:15] the Ephesian Church age but he says
[57:17] that's their promise that's the reward
[57:19] for the Overcomer their age is over
[57:22] where are they they're all everyone
[57:23] buried and dead in the ground waiting
[57:25] for a resurrection they're in another
[57:27] place don't get me wrong but they do not
[57:28] have eternal life in the sense of that
[57:30] they've they've lived for thousands of
[57:32] years but it says in Revelations 2 that
[57:34] they got to eat of the tree of eternal
[57:36] life so what is
[57:39] it they've already received their
[57:42] reward they've got it but nobody got to
[57:46] eat anything from a tree let's go back
[57:48] to Genesis 2 it says and the Lord God
[57:49] took the man and put him into the Garden
[57:52] of Eden to dress it and keep it and the
[57:54] Lord God commanded the man saying of
[57:56] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[58:00] freely eat every
[58:02] tree every tree of the garden that he's
[58:05] talking about that grew out of the
[58:07] ground amen there's a distinction be
[58:09] being given here and it's between the
[58:10] literal trees and then these other two
[58:12] trees the tree of knowledge and the tree
[58:14] of life he says but of the tree of
[58:17] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[58:18] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[58:20] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die
[58:23] this other tree of knowledge it's not
[58:24] allowed to be eaten at all but he says
[58:25] you can eat of every tree of the garden
[58:27] that came out of the ground but this is
[58:29] a different type of tree it's not a part
[58:31] of the garden at all it's not planted
[58:33] it's something completely
[58:35] different so we have to be really
[58:37] careful here because God's saying you
[58:39] can't eat of the fruit of that tree of
[58:40] knowledge of Good and Evil and we think
[58:42] that's a literal fruit but if we look to
[58:44] what the scripture says about eating
[58:46] fruit then we'll start to understand
[58:48] what this means and we have to see what
[58:49] the result of the eating of this fruit
[58:51] is to know what that fruit was because
[58:54] we ought to see that the effect match is
[58:57] the action whatever the effect is will
[59:00] tell you what the action was of eating
[59:01] this fruit you can know what's what
[59:04] something is see some this is so often
[59:06] what happens in things like medicine is
[59:08] they can't see the problem but they can
[59:10] see the effect of the problem and so
[59:12] they know what happens right they don't
[59:14] know that you have a cold but they can
[59:17] see if you've got your sinuses all
[59:18] clogged up or or if you got uh your
[59:21] tonsil swollen they can see the effect
[59:23] of the virus that they can't see so we
[59:25] look in the scriptures the same way and
[59:26] we say what was the eating of the fruit
[59:28] well if we look at the effect of eating
[59:30] the fruit we'll know what the fruit
[59:31] eating really was and from there we can
[59:33] find out what the tree of life is and
[59:35] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[59:36] amen we've got to match the effect to
[59:38] the action and if they don't match up
[59:39] then something's wrong it's like brother
[59:41] Bram said you know if if if it was
[59:43] eating an apple then we need to pass the
[59:45] apples because the Apple that they ate
[59:47] brought them a realization that they
[59:49] were naked and now everybody's running
[59:50] around naked so let's just pass the
[59:52] apples and maybe they'll go back to
[59:53] putting some clothes on Amen listen to
[59:56] what Jesus said in Matthew 15 Jesus said
[59:59] are ye yet also without understanding do
[1:00:02] you not yet understand that whatsoever
[1:00:04] entereth in at the mouth goeth into the
[1:00:05] belly and is cast out into the drought
[1:00:07] but those things which proceed out of
[1:00:09] the mouth come forth from the heart and
[1:00:11] they defile the man for out of the heart
[1:00:13] proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries
[1:00:16] fornications thefts false Witnesses and
[1:00:18] blasphemies the inner man is the problem
[1:00:21] not what you put in and what you put out
[1:00:22] the the eating of food does not separate
[1:00:24] us from from God
[1:00:26] that's not what puts us out and it never
[1:00:28] has been under the law they had rules
[1:00:32] for their diet but up to here they don't
[1:00:34] have any dietary laws whatever they want
[1:00:35] to eat they can eat amen so we need to
[1:00:39] know what this was and if we don't
[1:00:41] understand what happened here then we
[1:00:42] don't understand why we need a new birth
[1:00:44] why does why does the scripture even say
[1:00:46] that we're born
[1:00:48] again why does it talk about birth why
[1:00:51] why can't we just say it's a new page
[1:00:54] it's a rejuvenation
[1:00:56] it's a new beginning it's a new
[1:00:58] chapter why can't we just call it a
[1:01:00] cleansing or a cleaning why does it say
[1:01:03] we have to have a new birth why do we
[1:01:06] have to become a new creation a new
[1:01:08] creature why can't he just fix what this
[1:01:11] is It's All Tied together let's start
[1:01:14] where we're at now and then we'll build
[1:01:15] up from there David said this in Psalms
[1:01:18] 51 he says behold I was shapen that
[1:01:21] means I was produced I was brought into
[1:01:23] existence in iniquity
[1:01:26] what's iniquity doing what you know you
[1:01:28] ought not to do and he says and in sin
[1:01:32] did my mother conceive me now was David
[1:01:34] born out of wedlock no were his parents
[1:01:38] married yes was his mother a divorced
[1:01:41] and remarried woman no there is nothing
[1:01:44] wrong with David's mother in terms of
[1:01:46] her marriage in terms of her marital
[1:01:48] vows nothing like that and yet David
[1:01:50] says I was brought into existence doing
[1:01:54] something that was wrong
[1:01:57] and he says and in sin the sin was in my
[1:02:01] conception the sin was in the the
[1:02:03] initial start of this the action that
[1:02:05] brought him into existence amen Paul
[1:02:08] would come and say in Romans he says for
[1:02:10] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:02:12] glory of God now when the scripture uses
[1:02:15] superlatives like that it means it every
[1:02:18] single one of us has sinned and come
[1:02:20] short of the glory of God just by being
[1:02:23] born we are in sin
[1:02:26] but the question is
[1:02:28] why why babies are innocent aren't they
[1:02:33] they are innocent in in that they
[1:02:34] haven't made a decision for or against
[1:02:37] God but they are born in sin they are
[1:02:39] born sinful in their
[1:02:41] nature why there's something inherit
[1:02:44] inherent about our birth that makes us
[1:02:47] unacceptable before God and the question
[1:02:50] is what is
[1:02:51] it if we want to see how we're supposed
[1:02:53] to be born then we need to go to how the
[1:02:55] first person was born and then we can
[1:02:57] see the correct pattern the original
[1:02:58] pattern and then we can see how we fell
[1:03:00] out of that way so we see it on the
[1:03:02] sixth day when God created man it says
[1:03:04] so God created man in his own image in
[1:03:08] the image of God created he him so at
[1:03:10] that moment Adam is in God's image he's
[1:03:13] just like God and all the attributes of
[1:03:16] Adam are in him right
[1:03:18] there in his Spirit form the masculine
[1:03:22] the feminine side because remember a
[1:03:24] wife's going to be taken a woman's going
[1:03:25] to be taken taken out of him but in that
[1:03:27] original form every attribute that Adam
[1:03:30] has is going to be in there now that's
[1:03:32] key to understand as we move through
[1:03:33] this series the full attributes of Adam
[1:03:36] and his wife were in Adam as a spirit
[1:03:39] man from the
[1:03:41] start that's how we're supposed to come
[1:03:43] into existence it's just God producing
[1:03:47] another image of himself it's God
[1:03:50] producing another portion of himself
[1:03:52] it's God producing an attribute of
[1:03:53] himself and then what happened was Adam
[1:03:55] was supposed to continue on and on and
[1:03:57] on Amen but what is God doing here he's
[1:04:01] reproducing himself that's what Sons and
[1:04:04] Daughters of God are amen Gods produce
[1:04:08] Gods
[1:04:10] amen it says now he says so so in the
[1:04:12] image of God created he him semicolon
[1:04:15] break then he says male and female
[1:04:17] created he them this is a separation
[1:04:20] between the the original Adam and the
[1:04:22] future when God is going to now separate
[1:04:24] Adam out into two portions and he's
[1:04:26] going to give a male body in a male
[1:04:28] version and a female body with a female
[1:04:30] spirit all taken outside of Adam it'll
[1:04:32] be two separate bodies it says and God
[1:04:35] blessed them and God said unto them be
[1:04:36] fruitful and multiply replenish the
[1:04:39] Earth subdue it have dominion over the
[1:04:41] fish of the sea and over the foul of the
[1:04:42] air and over every living thing that
[1:04:44] moveth upon the Earth and God saw that
[1:04:47] everything that he had made and behold
[1:04:49] it was very good and the evening and the
[1:04:51] morning were the sixth day so God
[1:04:53] creates Adam in Genesis 1:27 in his
[1:04:55] image which is Spirit form amen and this
[1:04:59] is God's finished work that's God's
[1:05:02] finished work that's our original
[1:05:04] condition is a portion just like him
[1:05:07] remember what what what what it said in
[1:05:09] John it says God is a spirit and they
[1:05:12] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:05:14] spirit and in truth so Adam is
[1:05:16] originally in spirit form he's a spirit
[1:05:19] but he has attributes he has a
[1:05:20] personality he has all of the elements
[1:05:22] of a person but he does not have a
[1:05:24] physical body in which to express those
[1:05:27] yet church we ought to be able to see
[1:05:30] ourselves in that story right there
[1:05:32] because remember you'll if you see this
[1:05:33] you'll never Wonder again why you are
[1:05:36] the way you are why you can't be like
[1:05:38] everybody else why you think different
[1:05:40] why you praise different why you worship
[1:05:42] different why you believe different is
[1:05:43] because you come from a different source
[1:05:46] and Adam has all of these things every
[1:05:49] attribute of Adam and his wife was in
[1:05:50] existence right there in that Spirit
[1:05:52] form and God finished his creation and
[1:05:55] rested the very next day this is it it's
[1:05:57] done but then what happened because
[1:06:00] remember the word has a purpose and God
[1:06:03] has created all of these things and the
[1:06:06] intention is that man is going to
[1:06:08] interact with God's creation it's all
[1:06:10] part and parcel and so the word of God
[1:06:12] the purpose of God comes into effect
[1:06:15] because remember God has his own body
[1:06:17] remember the logos went out from God at
[1:06:19] the very beginning in the beginning
[1:06:21] there was a there was a great light came
[1:06:22] out the scripture says that was the
[1:06:24] logos out of God that was a form that
[1:06:27] God could dwell in and so he looks at
[1:06:30] Adam and Adam's a spirit but he has no
[1:06:32] form so what does Adam have to do to be
[1:06:34] in the image of God he has to now come
[1:06:35] from a spirit into a form that can
[1:06:38] interact with his own creation and so
[1:06:41] God's got a body Adam needs a body and
[1:06:44] so in Genesis 2 it says this and thus
[1:06:46] the heavens and the Earth were finished
[1:06:48] and all the host of them and on the
[1:06:49] seventh day God ended his work which he
[1:06:51] had made and he rested on the seventh
[1:06:53] day from all of his work which he had
[1:06:55] made jumping to verse 7 it says and the
[1:06:57] Lord God formed man of the Dust of the
[1:06:59] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[1:07:02] the breath of life and Man became a
[1:07:05] living Soul so in Genesis 1:27 God
[1:07:08] creates Man In His Image in a spirit
[1:07:10] form but he's not tangible or or nor
[1:07:12] does he have a physical body and there
[1:07:14] is no man to till the ground the
[1:07:16] scripture says so God forms a physical
[1:07:18] body for that Spirit to dwell in
[1:07:22] Hallelujah God has the scripture says
[1:07:24] remember Jesus says a body hast thou
[1:07:26] prepared me and then I look around today
[1:07:28] and I see a body hast thou prepared me
[1:07:30] for me to dwell in to interact with my
[1:07:33] own
[1:07:33] creation so if we look at these two
[1:07:36] passages between Genesis 1:27 and
[1:07:38] Genesis 2 we see that God created the
[1:07:40] man Spirit first and then he placed the
[1:07:43] spirit of the man into a body of dust
[1:07:46] into a natural body into a fleshly body
[1:07:48] but notice God told Adam to to to to to
[1:07:52] reproduce himself to replenish the Earth
[1:07:55] as a spirit
[1:07:59] man he didn't tell him to do it when he
[1:08:01] came into his physical body he told him
[1:08:02] to do it when he was still in spirit
[1:08:04] form man was not told to reprod
[1:08:07] reproduce through physical intimacy
[1:08:09] through sex he was told to reproduced
[1:08:11] before he ever had a
[1:08:13] body amen now people would look at us
[1:08:17] today and they'd say well impossible
[1:08:19] obviously we were supposed to do it the
[1:08:20] way we do it because all the Plumbing's
[1:08:22] there all the parts are there no that
[1:08:24] was free moral AG geny and we'll see
[1:08:27] that God has a way of producing life and
[1:08:29] then he gives another option where you
[1:08:31] can inject yourself into it and you can
[1:08:33] produce life that way and that's really
[1:08:35] the choice that Adam and Eve had to make
[1:08:36] in the desert in in the garden amen the
[1:08:39] body was always meant to produce
[1:08:41] children and we'll see that because you
[1:08:43] see the woman's she's going to be her
[1:08:45] her pain is going to be multiplied there
[1:08:48] was always going to be a struggle for
[1:08:49] birth there's always going to be
[1:08:50] something that that happened with this
[1:08:52] body but the conception of a child was
[1:08:54] meant to be a a holy thing not a sensual
[1:08:58] thing amen if we look in the beginning
[1:09:00] remember the man and the woman were
[1:09:02] completely innocent in the garden the
[1:09:04] scripture says and we've got it right
[1:09:06] here it says they were both naked the
[1:09:07] man and his wife and they were not
[1:09:09] ashamed that means they weren't
[1:09:10] embarrassed now physically perfect
[1:09:13] specimens why would you ever be
[1:09:14] embarrassed we'd say but no they were
[1:09:16] not embarrassed because there was no
[1:09:18] understanding or knowledge that came
[1:09:21] with seeing somebody naked it meant
[1:09:24] nothing to them clothes no clothes it
[1:09:26] meant nothing to them they were
[1:09:27] completely innocent they they there was
[1:09:30] no need for to cover up they weren't
[1:09:32] self-conscious they weren't embarrassed
[1:09:33] by these things it wasn't built into
[1:09:35] them they had no understanding of why
[1:09:38] nakedness would ever be a problem and we
[1:09:40] see that because we see later on after
[1:09:42] they eat the fruit what do they do they
[1:09:44] become aware of their nakedness we know
[1:09:46] it's tied all together so if Adam and
[1:09:48] his wife have been true to the word of
[1:09:50] God every Son of God every offspring of
[1:09:53] God would have been born by the creative
[1:09:55] work just like Adam was that's the way
[1:09:57] it should have happened amen remember
[1:09:59] David said my mother conceived me in sin
[1:10:01] she did it the wrong way it's the only
[1:10:03] way that she could but it was still the
[1:10:05] wrong way so the sin is in the
[1:10:06] conceiving not in the
[1:10:09] birthing so look at this there's only
[1:10:11] one perfect birth Beyond Adam that we
[1:10:13] know of and we find it in Luke chapter 1
[1:10:15] it says and the angel came in unto her
[1:10:17] to Mary and said hail Thou Art highly
[1:10:19] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[1:10:21] art thou among women and when she saw
[1:10:23] him she was troubled at his saying and
[1:10:25] cast in her mind what matter of
[1:10:27] salutation this should be and the angel
[1:10:30] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[1:10:32] Hast found favor with God and behold
[1:10:34] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[1:10:37] bring forth the son and shall call his
[1:10:39] name Jesus Remember the sin is in the
[1:10:42] conception and he said he shall be great
[1:10:44] and he shall be called the son of the
[1:10:46] highest and the Lord God shall give him
[1:10:48] the Throne of his father David he'll be
[1:10:51] the Son of God it says and he shall
[1:10:54] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[1:10:56] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[1:10:58] then Mary said unto the angel how shall
[1:11:01] this be seeing I know not a man she's
[1:11:03] saying there's only one way I know how
[1:11:05] to produce a child and that's with a man
[1:11:07] and I haven't known a man I don't plan
[1:11:09] on knowing a man and yet you're telling
[1:11:11] me I'm going to get
[1:11:13] pregnant now catch this it says the
[1:11:15] angel answered and said unto her the
[1:11:17] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[1:11:20] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:11:22] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[1:11:25] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:11:27] called The Son of God and so Christ was
[1:11:30] brought forth exactly the same way Adam
[1:11:33] was by the spoken word God says Let
[1:11:35] There Be and there was and so what
[1:11:38] happens now is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:39] overshadows Jesus Mary she doesn't have
[1:11:42] sex she doesn't have physical intimacy
[1:11:45] God creates a blood cell both an egg and
[1:11:48] sperm places it in a virgin takes her
[1:11:51] completely out of the equation
[1:11:52] Hallelujah takes her completely out she
[1:11:55] she has no DNA contribution to this baby
[1:11:58] it is perfect because it is a spoken
[1:12:00] word baby and it's the power of the Holy
[1:12:03] Ghost comes in here and it was a
[1:12:05] creative act it was not a sensual act it
[1:12:08] was a creation
[1:12:10] act Mary wouldn't have known she was
[1:12:12] pregnant or getting pregnant in that
[1:12:15] moment and the only way she knew was
[1:12:18] that her she started to change that's
[1:12:21] why brother Brandon would say that here
[1:12:23] we today we have the mystery of the
[1:12:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:12:28] sensation it is the it is the real New
[1:12:32] Birth where all you know is something
[1:12:34] has changed you may shout you may dance
[1:12:38] that ain't it you may shout you may
[1:12:41] dance you may just sit there and cry you
[1:12:44] may just get up and just have that
[1:12:46] complete weight lifted and you just know
[1:12:49] that you're a new creation you may feel
[1:12:51] everything and you may feel nothing it
[1:12:53] matters not what happens is are you
[1:12:55] impregnated with the word of God Amen
[1:12:57] that's what happened with Mary Mary had
[1:12:59] the word of God inside of her without
[1:13:01] sensation she didn't feel a thing but
[1:13:03] things started to change real quick and
[1:13:05] she knew amen so what happens now is
[1:13:07] that flesh forms around that blood cell
[1:13:09] it's a holy blood cell it's a Heavenly
[1:13:11] blood cell and now it produces a body
[1:13:14] that's called Jesus and now he's sinless
[1:13:16] flesh because there's nothing of our
[1:13:18] bloodline in him there's nothing of Mary
[1:13:21] in him it's God God God Amen there was
[1:13:24] no Act of s ual conception by Fallen
[1:13:26] Humanity with Jesus that's why he had to
[1:13:29] be born of a
[1:13:30] virgin so that she didn't have a part to
[1:13:32] play nor did any other man a man
[1:13:34] couldn't have a part why because the man
[1:13:36] and the woman are tainted there's a
[1:13:39] problem with the bloodline and the
[1:13:41] question is how is it tainted like I
[1:13:44] said before why is it that we have to
[1:13:46] suffer for Eve's decision and then
[1:13:49] Adam's decision on top of Eve's decision
[1:13:51] that's not fair it's not fair why do we
[1:13:54] have to get uh put into this horrible
[1:13:56] condition because Eve couldn't make the
[1:13:58] right
[1:14:00] decision why do we need to be born again
[1:14:03] why can't we just be born and make our
[1:14:05] own decision and God deal with us
[1:14:06] individually that way well we do get to
[1:14:08] make our own
[1:14:09] decision but this bloodline that we have
[1:14:12] this human bloodline is completely
[1:14:14] tainted and that's why we need a new
[1:14:16] birth we need a new birth because our
[1:14:18] natural birth is broken it is not of God
[1:14:21] it's Unholy we need to be born again by
[1:14:23] the holy spirit because that's how
[1:14:25] children of God are born that's how
[1:14:27] Jesus was born that's how Adam was born
[1:14:29] and that's how people are supposed to be
[1:14:31] born we need to be born by the word of
[1:14:33] God by the spoken word of God rather
[1:14:35] than the desire of men rather than the
[1:14:37] desire of women and that means we need
[1:14:39] to birth God's way instead of our way
[1:14:41] amen that's why a denominational birth
[1:14:44] won't won't happen and I'm telling you
[1:14:46] we can have denominational births in the
[1:14:47] message and we have it all the times
[1:14:49] because we say we believe the message
[1:14:51] therefore I have the Holy Ghost no the
[1:14:53] message is Christ and you've got to re
[1:14:55] receive him the person of him not the
[1:14:57] doctrine of him you've got to receive
[1:14:58] the person of him and be born again so
[1:15:00] that you're a new creation in Christ
[1:15:03] amen otherwise it's tainted to start
[1:15:05] with it's of it's of the desire and the
[1:15:07] will of men and women Paul calls it this
[1:15:09] way he says in 1 Corinthians and so it
[1:15:11] is written the first Adam was made a
[1:15:13] living soul and the last Adam was made a
[1:15:16] quickening spirit so who is the second
[1:15:18] Adam Christ what is he he's a quickening
[1:15:21] spirit it's a spirit that gives life
[1:15:22] that's what a quickening spirit is it's
[1:15:24] a life Spirit he's the Holy Spirit and
[1:15:26] we're going to get into godhead soon to
[1:15:28] explain that but the second adom is
[1:15:30] Christ and he's giving Life The Way We
[1:15:32] Were Meant to receive it amen by the
[1:15:36] spirit and power of God that's why you
[1:15:38] can't say the new birth is anything less
[1:15:39] than the than than receiving the Holy
[1:15:41] Ghost because that's a new birth it's
[1:15:43] the only part that gives you your a
[1:15:46] scriptural birth and pro a proper birth
[1:15:49] process he says how be it that was not
[1:15:51] first which is spiritual but that was it
[1:15:54] which is natural and afterward that
[1:15:56] which is spiritual see now we're born
[1:15:58] naturally and then we are born
[1:16:00] spiritually but Adam was born
[1:16:01] spiritually and then he came naturally
[1:16:03] see we're all twisted up we've got it
[1:16:05] backwards now sin inverted the plan of
[1:16:09] God we are supposed to be born of spirit
[1:16:11] and then we were supposed to be born of
[1:16:12] flesh but now we're born of Flesh
[1:16:15] completely wrong and then our spirit
[1:16:17] birth comes after that it's the New
[1:16:19] Birth by the Holy Spirit should have
[1:16:21] been spiritual first then second amen
[1:16:23] right now we're born first by the
[1:16:25] choosing of Mommy and Daddy and then
[1:16:27] second born by the choosing of God it
[1:16:29] was supposed to be by the choosing of
[1:16:30] God first and then through your
[1:16:33] parents he says the first man is of the
[1:16:36] earth earthy the second man is the Lord
[1:16:38] From Heaven Adam came first he messed up
[1:16:40] but now it's the Lord of Heaven it's
[1:16:42] Jesus Christ himself and he's the one
[1:16:43] that makes all things new so when we're
[1:16:46] born of the second Adam when we're born
[1:16:47] of Christ we're born of the Spirit by
[1:16:50] the word in the manner that we were
[1:16:51] supposed to have been born in the first
[1:16:53] place so that's all that's happened here
[1:16:55] is when somebody says I'm receiving
[1:16:57] Christ I'm giving my heart to Christ and
[1:16:59] he confirms their their their their
[1:17:01] repentance and their baptism by the holy
[1:17:02] spirit all that's happening is the birth
[1:17:05] that you were supposed to have in the
[1:17:06] first place first place but the problem
[1:17:08] is now you got to deal with this tainted
[1:17:09] flesh why is it tainted we'll get into
[1:17:11] it maybe a little bit this service but
[1:17:13] certainly on Sunday Lord willing because
[1:17:15] Peter comes Beyond he says now he says
[1:17:17] we're being born again not of
[1:17:20] corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by
[1:17:22] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:17:25] forever Peter says we've been born a
[1:17:26] corruptible seed why is it corruptible
[1:17:29] like I said eve made her mistake why do
[1:17:30] we have to pay for it but somehow our
[1:17:33] entire seed our entire uh human elements
[1:17:36] are corruptible there is nothing of God
[1:17:39] in them there's something that's broken
[1:17:41] amen he says but we are uh born of
[1:17:43] Incorruptible seed by the word of God
[1:17:45] Adam was born by the word of God Christ
[1:17:47] was born by the word of God you've got
[1:17:49] to be born by the word of God and it's
[1:17:52] the spirit that does it now we know our
[1:17:54] first birth is wrong because Peter says
[1:17:56] we've got to be born again our first
[1:17:58] birth is completely messed up we're born
[1:18:00] into the pain the sorrow the death the
[1:18:02] suffering but by the second birth now
[1:18:04] we're born into eternal life because we
[1:18:06] live and abide forever because it's a
[1:18:08] word birth so now we come back to the
[1:18:11] original question then what are the two
[1:18:12] trees in the
[1:18:14] garden the two trees in the garden are
[1:18:17] not literal trees they can't be they
[1:18:20] can't be but they are the principles of
[1:18:22] God regarding the production of life
[1:18:25] if I can put it that way they're placed
[1:18:27] in the midst of the garden of the human
[1:18:30] body brother Brown would say this he
[1:18:32] says they said we don't know you talking
[1:18:33] to Jesus we know you're a devil our
[1:18:36] fathers a Mana in the wilderness for the
[1:18:38] space of 40 years and Jesus said they're
[1:18:40] everyone dead but I am the bread of life
[1:18:42] that came from God out of Heaven if a
[1:18:44] man eats this bread he shall never die
[1:18:47] they said will this man give his body to
[1:18:48] eat they said now he's mad sure enough
[1:18:50] he says the bread of life was from the
[1:18:52] Tree of Life where they were eating from
[1:18:55] the Garden of Eden he was the Tree of
[1:18:58] Life Christ is the Tree of Life why
[1:19:01] because if you eat of Christ if you eat
[1:19:03] from Christ the word then you will have
[1:19:05] eternal life
[1:19:07] amen so that's your your first one who
[1:19:10] the question is not what was the tree of
[1:19:12] life it's who is the tree of life and it
[1:19:14] is Christ it is Christ but then he says
[1:19:17] now if the tree of life was a person
[1:19:19] then the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:19:21] Evil he says was also a person
[1:19:25] it's an embodiment if we want to put it
[1:19:27] that way it's an embodiment of the
[1:19:30] principle you have the principle of uh
[1:19:33] of Life by the word of God by the spirit
[1:19:35] of God then you have the principle of
[1:19:37] Life by knowledge and it comes with good
[1:19:39] and it comes with
[1:19:41] evil see Christ the word was supposed to
[1:19:44] be our source of Life his spoken word
[1:19:46] was what created the the the earth and
[1:19:48] the heavens and the humans and that was
[1:19:49] supposed to continue like I said Gods
[1:19:51] produced Gods when Adam was put on the
[1:19:54] Earth you go to Luke 3:38 and it says
[1:19:57] that Adam was the son of
[1:20:00] God so God's produced sons of gods who
[1:20:03] produce sons of gods who produce sons of
[1:20:05] gods we were supposed to be a race of
[1:20:07] gods of many gods of Sons and Daughters
[1:20:10] of God on this Earth and Adam was
[1:20:12] supposed to continue the work of
[1:20:14] producing
[1:20:16] life but what's the other option now
[1:20:19] Adam can produce Life by the spoken word
[1:20:22] in God's season because life comes by
[1:20:24] INSP pration not by choose not by choice
[1:20:27] God would have ordained it God would
[1:20:28] have had a time but now Adam has a
[1:20:30] second option for life he has it by the
[1:20:33] spoken word or he has it by his own body
[1:20:36] amen now Adam couldn't be tempted by
[1:20:38] choice in spirit form but when he's put
[1:20:41] into physical form he still can't be
[1:20:44] tempted by choice until the second
[1:20:46] attribute of Adam's brought out and now
[1:20:48] a woman is placed in his life now he's
[1:20:51] got a
[1:20:53] choice but God says do it my way and
[1:20:56] just ignore this other option God
[1:20:58] doesn't tell him what it's about God
[1:21:00] doesn't tell him what it's for God just
[1:21:02] says leave that alone don't do anything
[1:21:05] with that and you just wait on me and do
[1:21:07] it my way amen So within Adam it's
[1:21:11] physically possible to produce life he
[1:21:13] had a literal ability to produce life
[1:21:15] like any other man would he has seed but
[1:21:18] he needs a garden if I can put it that
[1:21:20] way and then I'm using the terms of
[1:21:22] scripture now okay I'll use the word
[1:21:24] words of scripture Adam has seed Adam
[1:21:27] has a tree he needs a garden right and
[1:21:30] we're talking about trees and fruit
[1:21:31] we're talking about seed as we'll get
[1:21:32] into in the next service so God says to
[1:21:34] Adam don't touch anything about the tree
[1:21:37] in the midst of the garden don't do
[1:21:39] anything with anything that's in the
[1:21:40] middle of it all what's the garden
[1:21:43] what's the danger listen to Eve's own
[1:21:45] words now she says she's talking to the
[1:21:47] serpent worst mistake ever but of the
[1:21:50] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:21:52] of the garden God has said ye shall not
[1:21:54] eat of it but catch what she says here
[1:21:57] neither shall you touch
[1:22:01] it don't it's not just about the eating
[1:22:04] it's about the touching young people
[1:22:06] there's a reason why we tell you don't
[1:22:09] touch before marriage because we'll see
[1:22:12] what happens is when you touch things
[1:22:14] happen and you can't help it and it
[1:22:16] leads down a certain path and so we
[1:22:19] teach you to keep yourself separate so
[1:22:21] that you don't awaken something that was
[1:22:23] innocent otherwise
[1:22:25] Adam and Eve were innocent until touch
[1:22:28] then when they touched when things were
[1:22:29] touched that's when things happened
[1:22:32] amen he said she said now you're not
[1:22:34] supposed to eat it we're not supposed to
[1:22:37] touch it l we die what is death
[1:22:39] separation from
[1:22:41] God says and then we know that he goes
[1:22:44] through and he says no no that's not the
[1:22:45] way it is and we'll cover this more on
[1:22:46] Sunday as we we really talk about what
[1:22:48] happened during the in the scene in the
[1:22:50] original scene but it says but when the
[1:22:52] woman saw okay she she started
[1:22:56] looking when the woman saw that the tree
[1:22:58] was good for food food her interest was
[1:23:00] quickened her curiosity was peaked she
[1:23:02] saw
[1:23:03] potential right and that it was pleasant
[1:23:06] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:23:08] make one wise catches she is completely
[1:23:11] convinced of what the serpent said she's
[1:23:14] convinced that what he's talking about
[1:23:15] what he shared with her about her body
[1:23:17] about his body about her husband's body
[1:23:19] whatever she's completely convinced that
[1:23:21] this is a good thing it says she took of
[1:23:24] the fruit fruit thereof did eat so she
[1:23:26] partook of this fruit without her
[1:23:28] husband and then gave
[1:23:30] also so she gave once and then she gave
[1:23:34] also unto her husband with her and he
[1:23:37] did eat so she partook of the fruit once
[1:23:40] and then she went and she partook of it
[1:23:41] with her husband two separate events
[1:23:44] amen we'll get into this on Sunday and
[1:23:46] talk about what that was so what's
[1:23:48] they're talking about this woman's
[1:23:50] eating fruit This Woman's eating fruit
[1:23:52] and then she takes it to her husband and
[1:23:53] her husband eats fruit what is this all
[1:23:55] about well beautifully the scripture
[1:23:57] gives us our
[1:23:58] answers Song of Solomon says this such
[1:24:02] is the way of an adulterous woman she
[1:24:05] eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I
[1:24:08] have done no wickness no wickedness an
[1:24:11] adulterous woman notice it doesn't say
[1:24:13] fornication adulterous a married
[1:24:16] woman eats and then she wipes her mouth
[1:24:20] and says I didn't do
[1:24:23] anything what is it the physical act of
[1:24:26] intimacy is described in the scripture
[1:24:28] as eating amen adultery is called out
[1:24:32] not fornication fornications premarital
[1:24:34] in intimacy this is somebody a woman
[1:24:37] that's married having relations with
[1:24:39] somebody who's not her husband and it's
[1:24:41] called
[1:24:42] eating okay why not fornication because
[1:24:46] it's a married woman Solomon new what
[1:24:48] was talking about here he continues in
[1:24:50] Solomon in chapter 4 he says a garden
[1:24:53] enclosed is my sister not his actual
[1:24:55] sister Solomon wasn't a pervert that's
[1:24:57] just the way they talked about a woman
[1:24:59] that's the way they named it back then
[1:25:01] my sister my spouse she is a spring shut
[1:25:03] up a fountain sealed notice his wife is
[1:25:06] Clos to everyone else she's not to be
[1:25:08] touched by anyone else then he says thy
[1:25:10] plants are an orchard of pomegranates
[1:25:13] with Pleasant
[1:25:15] fruits what is an orchard a group of
[1:25:18] trees and he says now to this woman
[1:25:20] you're a group of trees you have
[1:25:22] pleasant fruits camper with with
[1:25:24] spikenard spikenard and saffron calamus
[1:25:27] and cinnamon with all trees of
[1:25:29] frankincense myrr and allows with all
[1:25:31] the chief spices he says you're a
[1:25:33] fountain of Gardens and a well of Living
[1:25:35] Waters and streams from Lebanon awake Oh
[1:25:38] north wind and Come Thou s blow upon my
[1:25:40] garden that the spices thereof May flow
[1:25:42] out let my beloved come into his garden
[1:25:46] and eat his Pleasant
[1:25:48] fruits this is all speaking of marital
[1:25:51] relations between a man and a woman
[1:25:53] between a husband and his wife so what
[1:25:56] is a garden Church a garden is a place
[1:25:58] where you plant
[1:25:59] seeds a garden is a place where fruit is
[1:26:02] grown amen it's a place that produces
[1:26:05] life in these scriptures the bride
[1:26:08] refers to herself as her husband's
[1:26:10] garden and when the act that they they
[1:26:13] perform together is called eating and
[1:26:15] her body parts are referred to as
[1:26:19] fruits I'm trying not to be too explicit
[1:26:21] this evening but you understand what I'm
[1:26:24] saying certainly the the more mature
[1:26:26] amongst us will understand then T of
[1:26:28] Solomon continues he says I come into my
[1:26:30] garden my sister my spouse I've gathered
[1:26:32] my myrrh with my spice I've eaten my
[1:26:35] honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my
[1:26:38] wine with th my milk eat oh friends
[1:26:40] drink yay drink abundantly oh beloved he
[1:26:43] says and then she says she responds my
[1:26:45] beloved has gone down into his garden to
[1:26:47] the bed of spices to feed in the gardens
[1:26:50] and to gather lies I am my beloveds my
[1:26:53] beloved is mine he feedeth among the
[1:26:55] lies all of the physical acts that are
[1:26:57] supposed to be within marriage are
[1:26:58] described as feeding on fruits on things
[1:27:02] that are from trees amen over and over
[1:27:05] Solomon refers to the woman as a garden
[1:27:08] a place for feeding a place for eating
[1:27:10] and it's all a reference to physical
[1:27:11] intimacy so then what is the eating of
[1:27:14] the fruit of the tree of knowledge of
[1:27:15] Good and Evil it is physical intimacy
[1:27:18] between a male and a female that's what
[1:27:21] it is that's all it is for the intention
[1:27:23] of producing life it is producing life
[1:27:27] by physical Choice rather than by the
[1:27:29] spoken word so the tree of knowledge is
[1:27:32] the ability to produce Life by your
[1:27:35] choosing rather than God's choosing amen
[1:27:38] it's taking matters into your own hands
[1:27:40] is what it is rather than waiting on
[1:27:42] God's timing God's season and that's
[1:27:44] really the root of the problem here is
[1:27:45] that they've been given an order they've
[1:27:47] been given a commission from God and
[1:27:49] he's told them don't do it this way and
[1:27:51] she gets completely turned around to
[1:27:53] where she does it the way God says don't
[1:27:54] do it and what did she do she took the
[1:27:58] matters into her own hands instead of
[1:27:59] doing it the way God said and she
[1:28:02] thought well he told me to produce life
[1:28:04] so I'm going to produce life I'm going
[1:28:06] to try it this way it hasn't happened
[1:28:08] any other way that's the way we try and
[1:28:11] do it isn't it we try and do things by
[1:28:12] wisdom we try and do it by knowledge we
[1:28:14] do it by Logic we do it by reason we do
[1:28:16] it by experience we do it by education
[1:28:18] and all we've produced Humanity I'm
[1:28:21] talking of is the death and destruction
[1:28:23] we see around us we think we're doing
[1:28:25] good and what comes out is we make it
[1:28:27] worse we get better on one side and we
[1:28:29] make it worse there and all we're doing
[1:28:31] is going higher and higher and higher in
[1:28:32] our levels of understanding and we're
[1:28:34] getting deeper and deeper deeper in our
[1:28:36] levels of Destruction you look at what
[1:28:38] we've done with with nuclear power we've
[1:28:41] made amazing weapons we've we've
[1:28:44] produced some of the cleanest possible
[1:28:46] energy but when things go wrong or it's
[1:28:49] put into the wrong hands or used
[1:28:50] incorrectly you got a power that can
[1:28:52] destroy this world many many many times
[1:28:55] over it can pollute every stream of
[1:28:56] water every ocean every
[1:28:59] Lake the the the potential for
[1:29:01] Destruction is so high with something so
[1:29:03] simple everything we do it it touches it
[1:29:07] remember it says it's a tree of
[1:29:08] knowledge of Good and Evil and usually
[1:29:11] what it is is we think we're doing good
[1:29:13] and evil comes out of it because why we
[1:29:16] are convinced of our own
[1:29:19] rightness and that's the Human Condition
[1:29:22] we're convinced that because we think
[1:29:24] right because we believe it's right it
[1:29:26] is right and it's not the word of God is
[1:29:28] right and everything else is wrong
[1:29:30] that's what a Believer believes amen
[1:29:32] that's the Trap that he fell into she
[1:29:34] listened to the servant serpent long
[1:29:36] enough that he convinced her that this
[1:29:38] way that God said do not do this no
[1:29:40] matter what do not touch it she was
[1:29:42] convinced this is good and he completely
[1:29:44] Twisted her around in the word and what
[1:29:47] happened total separation from God and
[1:29:49] every bit of pain and suffering and
[1:29:51] sorrow that we have today is because she
[1:29:54] decided I'm going to try and do it but
[1:29:56] here's the thing she thought she was
[1:29:59] doing well remember brother Bram says
[1:30:01] you can be sincerely wrong sincerely
[1:30:04] wrong people are the hardest ones to
[1:30:06] correct because they did it with good
[1:30:09] intentions but this is how we know if
[1:30:12] we're right or wrong not by our
[1:30:13] sincerity by lining up with the word of
[1:30:15] God every single
[1:30:18] time what did she do she lost the
[1:30:20] authority of Sons and Daughters of
[1:30:22] God Paul would
[1:30:24] references Paul always amazes me the
[1:30:27] depth of scriptures that he had he says
[1:30:28] would to God you have bear with me a
[1:30:30] little in my Folly and indeed bear with
[1:30:32] me he says I know you think I'm foolish
[1:30:34] sometimes the things I tell you the
[1:30:35] things I write to you you go on and on
[1:30:37] about this stuff what are we children
[1:30:40] and he says for I am jealous over you
[1:30:42] with Godly jealousy for I have espoused
[1:30:44] you to one husband he says I I I have
[1:30:47] engaged you to one person one husband he
[1:30:50] says that I may present you as a chased
[1:30:54] virgin to Christ notice he says i' I've
[1:30:56] engaged you to Christ there's only one
[1:30:58] person you're supposed to marry there's
[1:31:00] only one bride and there's only one
[1:31:02] bridegroom and that's Christ and his
[1:31:04] bride he says and I've engaged you to
[1:31:06] him as a Chase virgin nobody else is
[1:31:09] supposed to touch you before you get to
[1:31:12] him no religion no men's ideas no
[1:31:14] denominational thinking but here's his
[1:31:17] concern he says here's why I act the way
[1:31:19] I act here's why I write the way I write
[1:31:21] why I do the things I do he says but I
[1:31:23] fear I'm worried lest by any means as
[1:31:26] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:31:29] subtlety that word beguile means to Holy
[1:31:33] seduced holy not h o l y w h l l y to
[1:31:37] completely seduce he says as the serpent
[1:31:40] completely seduced Eve through his
[1:31:42] subtlety what happened she wasn't a
[1:31:45] chased virgin when she came to Adam
[1:31:48] speaking frankly she lost her innocence
[1:31:51] she lost her virtue
[1:31:53] because she got tricked and Paul says
[1:31:55] I'm worried that you're going to get
[1:31:57] tricked and you're going to lose the
[1:31:59] innocence that comes with being a bride
[1:32:01] of
[1:32:02] Christ he says that how he he beguiled
[1:32:05] Eve how he completely seduced Eve
[1:32:06] through his subtlety we said before
[1:32:09] Satan's not coming across your your lawn
[1:32:11] and saying here I'm going to show you a
[1:32:12] way that's going to make you miserable
[1:32:14] and it's going to destroy your life and
[1:32:15] it's going to destroy your body and it's
[1:32:17] going to destroy your family it's going
[1:32:18] to destroy your walk with Christ Satan
[1:32:20] never does that he comes in nice and
[1:32:21] easy just one little bit of at a time
[1:32:24] one footstep one habit one door at a
[1:32:27] time just a little bit little bit little
[1:32:29] bit little bit and then 3 months down
[1:32:30] the road we wonder where we lost the
[1:32:31] victory it was in the first little bit
[1:32:34] and we're just realizing it now he says
[1:32:37] that your minds should be corrupted from
[1:32:39] the Simplicity that is in Christ notice
[1:32:41] he worried about our minds cuz that's
[1:32:44] what Eve got she got beaten in her mind
[1:32:47] she got seduced in her mind he so
[1:32:49] wrapped her mind up in reason and logic
[1:32:51] and explanation and his understanding
[1:32:53] and her wow I never thought about it
[1:32:55] that way Church you don't have to think
[1:32:58] about it just take this the Simplicity
[1:33:01] of the word the Simplicity of Christ and
[1:33:04] believe it and God will show you the
[1:33:05] reality of it God will show you what it
[1:33:07] really means we don't have to understand
[1:33:09] everything but Satan comes to us and he
[1:33:11] says I understand it let me show you and
[1:33:13] he takes us down a path of death and
[1:33:14] destruction but he says so your mind
[1:33:17] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[1:33:19] that's in Christ because once the mind
[1:33:21] is convinced the body will follow you
[1:33:23] look at men that get seduced by women or
[1:33:25] women that get seduced by men it starts
[1:33:27] up here and when you give permission up
[1:33:30] here the body follows that's it I don't
[1:33:33] care what's your addiction what's your
[1:33:34] habit what your problem is you lose it
[1:33:37] here the body follows every single time
[1:33:40] it's a mind battle first and that's why
[1:33:42] we need a a holy ghost in our soul that
[1:33:46] we've got somebody fighting to push back
[1:33:48] on these things because otherwise the
[1:33:49] mind is completely Satan's we've got to
[1:33:51] have something inside of us that pushes
[1:33:52] back and what Up Is Us in Disobedience
[1:33:55] to God and His word because we've lost
[1:33:57] the battle of the Mind Paul saying I'm
[1:33:59] trying to keep you from from having what
[1:34:01] happened to Eve she got she talked too
[1:34:05] long with the wrong person she listened
[1:34:07] to the wrong thing she watched the wrong
[1:34:09] thing she listened to the wrong
[1:34:12] podcasts she hung around the wrong
[1:34:14] people and pretty soon her mind got
[1:34:16] corrupted from the
[1:34:18] Simplicity of only
[1:34:20] belief that's the only thing he asked
[1:34:23] her to do believe it and act on what you
[1:34:25] believe and she stayed around it too
[1:34:28] long and he says if you don't go and
[1:34:31] hide behind that word they'll get you
[1:34:33] with their arguments they'll get you
[1:34:34] with their reasons they'll get you with
[1:34:36] their education they'll get you with
[1:34:37] their experiences they'll get you with
[1:34:39] their victories and
[1:34:41] solutions
[1:34:42] absolutely and we end up in a place
[1:34:45] where we'll do exactly the wrong thing
[1:34:47] and think that we're going to please God
[1:34:48] with it because we've lost a mind
[1:34:51] battle let me finish with this thought
[1:34:54] and we'll finish the rest on Sunday Lord
[1:34:57] willing they're talking to Jesus and
[1:34:59] they're trying to catch him they're
[1:35:00] trying to trip him up fool him in the
[1:35:02] same day came to him the Sadducees which
[1:35:03] say there's no resurrection and asked
[1:35:05] him saying master master uh Master Moses
[1:35:09] said if a man die having no children his
[1:35:11] brother shall marry his wife and raise
[1:35:13] up seed unto his brother now there were
[1:35:15] with us seven Brethren there
[1:35:18] weren't and the first which he had
[1:35:20] married a wife deceased and having no
[1:35:22] issue left his wife unto his brother
[1:35:24] likewise the second also and the third
[1:35:25] under the seventh so they said and the
[1:35:27] last of all the woman died also so
[1:35:29] remember in the in the Old Testament
[1:35:31] days if your if your brother's if your
[1:35:33] brother died and he had a wife and he
[1:35:35] didn't have any any any sons then you
[1:35:38] had to go in and try impregnate his wife
[1:35:40] for him so that the family name could
[1:35:42] continue and so they said this woman she
[1:35:45] married the first brother he didn't
[1:35:46] produce an air she went into the second
[1:35:48] brother and then he couldn't produce one
[1:35:50] and they all died off one by one having
[1:35:52] tried to impregnate her having taken her
[1:35:54] to wife and then finally she dies having
[1:35:57] no Heir at all no children by any of
[1:35:59] them it says now therefore in the
[1:36:01] resurrection whose wife shall she be of
[1:36:04] the seven for they all had
[1:36:06] her they said we've got a conundrum here
[1:36:09] Jesus over there she's going to have
[1:36:11] seven husbands who gets to say that's my
[1:36:14] wife Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:36:16] ye do Heir he says you're making a
[1:36:18] mistake not knowing the scriptures nor
[1:36:21] the power of God for in the Resurrection
[1:36:24] they neither marry nor are given in
[1:36:26] marriage but are as the angels of God in
[1:36:29] heaven Church we're in a process of
[1:36:31] redemption and we're being brought back
[1:36:33] to our original position our original
[1:36:35] bodies the way of being and Jesus says
[1:36:37] look when redemption's over you aren't
[1:36:40] going to be married the way you are here
[1:36:42] there is no marrying and giving in
[1:36:44] marriage over there there are no
[1:36:46] feelings associated with it there is no
[1:36:48] hold on somebody the way that you have
[1:36:50] on them here there was companionship in
[1:36:52] the garden but there was not marital
[1:36:56] intimacy so the question is how did we
[1:36:58] all get here if that wasn't there in the
[1:36:59] first place somebody had to break the
[1:37:01] intimacy barrier but he says listen when
[1:37:04] we get over when they get over there
[1:37:06] there is no wives like that there's only
[1:37:09] companions there's help
[1:37:12] meets remember people that are suited to
[1:37:15] you to be with you but brother Mark and
[1:37:17] sister Moren will not be husband and
[1:37:19] wife they'll be
[1:37:21] companions as long as they were the
[1:37:22] right ones
[1:37:24] we trust you are amen Jesus says you
[1:37:29] guys are you're so wrapped up in your
[1:37:30] own self you don't understand you're so
[1:37:32] Fallen you can't even understand over
[1:37:34] there there is no such thing as marriage
[1:37:35] why because there's only one bride and
[1:37:36] one bridegroom and that's Christ and the
[1:37:38] bride we're married to him and he is our
[1:37:41] life and he is our satisfaction and he
[1:37:44] is our love and he's all the feelings
[1:37:45] and emotions and things that we want
[1:37:47] with one another we're just a part of
[1:37:49] the same body look at it this way this
[1:37:52] is real simple okay
[1:37:58] that does nothing for me cuz I'm hugging
[1:38:02] myself over there Blanc and I will hug
[1:38:06] each other and all it is is me hugging
[1:38:08] myself we're part of the same body there
[1:38:10] is no sensuality when I touch myself and
[1:38:13] over there she will just be a part of me
[1:38:16] because we're all a part of the body of
[1:38:17] Christ there's no filth there there's no
[1:38:20] perversion there's no sensuality in
[1:38:22] those ways remember when brother
[1:38:24] brandham went over you don't believe me
[1:38:25] listen to our Prophet brother brandham
[1:38:27] goes over beyond the curtain of time and
[1:38:29] he says there's people coming up him men
[1:38:32] and women alike and the sisters sisters
[1:38:35] don't ever do this they run up to the to
[1:38:37] the prophet and they say our precious
[1:38:39] brother and they're giving him big
[1:38:42] hugs and he's like
[1:38:45] whoa but he says I didn't feel a
[1:38:50] thing why because it's Perfection Beyond
[1:38:53] perfection
[1:38:54] Beyond Perfection he's gone into a glor
[1:38:56] not in a glorified body but he's in a
[1:38:58] Heavenly condition now he's experiencing
[1:39:00] what we will experience in heaven
[1:39:03] there's no sensation for these things
[1:39:04] and his own wives too came up to him and
[1:39:08] hugged him and he felt no sensation and
[1:39:12] he said it was the best place he'd ever
[1:39:14] been and all he wanted to do was go back
[1:39:16] he says how could I be scared of going
[1:39:18] across crossing over beyond the curtain
[1:39:20] of time it was the greatest thing ever
[1:39:23] no sensation this is what Adam and Eve
[1:39:26] had in the
[1:39:27] beginning they were just
[1:39:29] companions just Companions and it's
[1:39:32] later that they cleave unto one another
[1:39:35] and they come into a certain
[1:39:37] relationship as we close on this David
[1:39:40] said oh taste and see that the Lord is
[1:39:42] good blessed is the man that trusted in
[1:39:44] him you know what e did she saw and she
[1:39:47] tasted what she wasn't supposed to and
[1:39:50] you know
[1:39:52] what it might have felt good it might
[1:39:54] have tasted good but what It produced
[1:39:56] was bitter in her belly amen it pays to
[1:40:00] wait on God we're in the season of
[1:40:03] adoption we're in the season of
[1:40:04] Resurrection we're in the season of
[1:40:06] rapture and it feels sometimes like
[1:40:08] we've got to make it happen we don't
[1:40:11] have to do a thing Church except only
[1:40:14] believe stay with the word of God and
[1:40:17] trust that in his perfect timing the
[1:40:19] life will come forth exactly the way it
[1:40:22] was planted
[1:40:24] amen God said you can eat all of the
[1:40:27] Trees of life you want out of the tree
[1:40:29] of life you can eat that all day every
[1:40:30] day but don't touch it and if they'd
[1:40:32] only listened church we wouldn't be
[1:40:34] where we are today but they did they
[1:40:37] tasted and they saw the wrong things you
[1:40:39] know what that's so often our problem is
[1:40:41] we're tasting and seeing far too many
[1:40:43] things that don't line up with the word
[1:40:45] of God and then we wonder where's the
[1:40:47] life where's the life where's the life
[1:40:51] what are you tasting and seeing amen
[1:40:54] if the musicians would
[1:40:56] come we can all stand together you know
[1:40:58] one of the hardest things a Believer has
[1:40:59] to do is
[1:41:01] wait wait on the Lord wait on his timing
[1:41:04] trust him to do the work I was talking
[1:41:07] with uh someone the other day and they
[1:41:09] were talking about Boaz remember when
[1:41:11] Ruth comes back the last state of Ruth
[1:41:13] is rest the last thing that she's doing
[1:41:15] is resting she's been she's been leave
[1:41:17] she's had to leave her her home she's
[1:41:19] had to leave her family she's had to
[1:41:20] leave her country she's had to leave her
[1:41:22] religion now she comes in and she comes
[1:41:24] into Israel and she and she's working
[1:41:26] and she's working and then she gets a
[1:41:28] promise and then she's supposed to go
[1:41:30] home and she's wondering and she's
[1:41:32] fretting and Nai says Ruth take your
[1:41:34] rest I know this guy and he won't rest
[1:41:38] until he does exactly what he's promised
[1:41:40] you he's going to do we're in the
[1:41:42] resting phase now that doesn't mean
[1:41:44] we're sitting on our couches but it
[1:41:46] means that we're trusting God to do the
[1:41:48] work that he said he was going to do he
[1:41:50] says he's going to give us rapturing
[1:41:51] faith I believe he's going to give us
[1:41:52] rapturing faith Faith he said he's going
[1:41:54] to heal our bodies I believe he's
[1:41:55] healing our bodies he said he's going to
[1:41:57] save our souls I believe he's saving
[1:41:58] Souls anden that he's filling with the
[1:42:00] Holy Ghost that he's producing his own
[1:42:02] life over again and producing images of
[1:42:04] Christ all over again
[1:42:07] amen God told
[1:42:09] Adam then God told Eve he says be
[1:42:12] fruitful and multiply and you know what
[1:42:14] she was the right person in the right
[1:42:17] place in the right season and all she
[1:42:20] did wrong was she got out of the time of
[1:42:23] God she forced the issue Don't force the
[1:42:26] issue Don't force the issue don't get so
[1:42:29] desperate that you take matters into
[1:42:30] your own hands Abraham and Sarah they
[1:42:33] forced the issue and we've had no rest
[1:42:35] in the Middle East ever since Moses
[1:42:37] forced the
[1:42:38] issue and all he got was one dead
[1:42:40] Egyptian brother Bram
[1:42:43] said wasn't in God's timing it pays to
[1:42:47] do what the L what the Lord says by the
[1:42:48] word taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:42:52] wait on the Lord and be of good courage
[1:42:54] and he'll strengthen your heart the
[1:42:55] scripture says amen that's what we're
[1:42:57] learning every day isn't it to wait on
[1:42:59] the Lord to trust him it's a waiting
[1:43:02] game Church scripture says it seems like
[1:43:04] he's going to keep waiting and waiting
[1:43:06] he's not going to come but then he's
[1:43:07] going to come and it'll be in a moment
[1:43:10] and you'll wonder how did it all happen
[1:43:11] so fast I believe there's people that
[1:43:14] are going to see it all happening and
[1:43:15] they'll be outside of it and they'll
[1:43:17] wonder I didn't see that coming how did
[1:43:19] I not see that coming because when God
[1:43:21] moves he moves in a Split Second and
[1:43:23] it's a quick short work and then it's
[1:43:25] all done people are like wait I thought
[1:43:27] I thought I thought I had time no be
[1:43:31] faithful now taste and see stay with the
[1:43:34] word of God and then when that time
[1:43:36] comes we won't be disappointed amen
[1:43:37] we'll be praising the Lord As We rise
[1:43:39] through the air amen God bless you let's
[1:43:42] bow our heads Heavenly
[1:43:44] Father Lord It's sobering to look at
[1:43:46] these things but Lord we know the
[1:43:49] scripture is given for our admonition
[1:43:51] Lord that we can learn
[1:43:53] Lord and we see here that Eve's problem
[1:43:55] was she stopped and listened to the
[1:43:56] wrong person Lord she didn't listen to
[1:43:59] your word she didn't feed on your word
[1:44:00] she didn't feed on on on the husband
[1:44:03] that you've given her to protect her and
[1:44:04] help her Lord she got out of place Lord
[1:44:08] Adam got out of place he didn't guard
[1:44:09] her either and Lord I pray you help us
[1:44:11] to stay in our place at our post of Duty
[1:44:13] heavenly father that we not look to the
[1:44:15] right nor the left Lord that we'd not
[1:44:17] look for answers outside of your word
[1:44:19] Lord that we'd not look for affirmation
[1:44:21] for satisfaction for Joy or peace or any
[1:44:24] of these things but Lord that we go to
[1:44:26] the fountain that you provided Lord The
[1:44:28] Living Word of God lord and that your
[1:44:30] presence by the Holy Spirit Lord would
[1:44:32] Quicken these things in our life Lord
[1:44:34] that we be impregnated by your word that
[1:44:36] we produce Christ all over again in our
[1:44:38] lives and our bodies Lord in our
