[46:08] lord your word says we're like trees

[46:32] god and lord we want to bear the fruit

[46:38] may we just drink tonight of your word
[46:41] lord may not just fill us but may it
[46:43] cleanse us lord may it wash us may it
[46:45] just prepare us lord for your presence
[46:47] lord may it draw us into closer
[46:49] relationship with you we pray amen lord
[46:51] minister to your people here now we pray
[46:54] lord many not here tonight lord we pray
[46:56] your grace to them each one in jesus
[46:58] christ's name we ask it amen amen thank
[47:01] you musicians that'll be it you'll turn
[47:03] your scriptures to hebrews chapter 11.
[47:06] and then hebrews chapter 11 it's good to
[47:07] have sister maureen back and then good
[47:09] to have sister justine back
[47:12] amen
[47:14] good to be here this evening i uh
[47:16] i still am not a hundred percent well
[47:19] and i was down and just after supper
[47:21] just kind of going through my notes and
[47:23] preparing and i
[47:24] i said lord i've got a headache
[47:26] i said would you just take it away so i
[47:28] can preach fully here tonight and
[47:30] something just went over me and it went
[47:31] completely away right then and there
[47:33] amen he still moves
[47:35] and then he's moved by the request of
[47:37] his sons and daughters he's moved by the
[47:40] by people that want to serve him amen
[47:41] he's moved by people that desire to do
[47:43] something for him and brother branham
[47:45] has always said if you're in the line of
[47:46] duty then you can ask what you will to
[47:48] get it done amen now i had to preach
[47:50] whether or not i had a headache but it's
[47:52] his grace that takes away the headache
[47:53] amen and makes it a little easier
[47:55] tonight and then so i'm thankful for
[47:57] that also had a we had a request come
[47:59] through the website recently and brother
[48:01] matt ford to me of a young man or a man
[48:03] i don't know how old he is he wanted to
[48:04] know more about the message so he's in
[48:06] nova scotia and he was asking if there
[48:08] was a church or believers there or
[48:09] something so i put him in contact with
[48:11] brother alex cater brother alec
[48:13] volunteered very quickly he said yes i'd
[48:15] love to to talk to him he just wanted to
[48:17] had some questions wanted to know about
[48:19] water baptism and these things he
[48:20] reached out to me
[48:21] again today and said that he's got the
[48:23] the message app and he listens to the
[48:24] message every day so i don't know how he
[48:27] he got a hold of this i don't know where
[48:28] it's coming from amen but isn't that
[48:30] just like god to just reach in and just
[48:32] one person here and one person there and
[48:34] all of a sudden they're
[48:36] they've got they've got the the word of
[48:38] the hour and they're they're walking
[48:39] towards the rapture the same as if
[48:40] they're always doing today manny just
[48:42] touches them and brings them up to a
[48:43] place so we want to remember bradley in
[48:45] our prayers and of course brother alec
[48:47] as he he talks with him and fellowships
[48:49] with them may it be just a benefit to
[48:50] both of them amen and may draw them
[48:52] closer to god
[48:54] amen hebrews chapter 11 very familiar
[48:56] verse verse 1 says now faith is the
[48:58] substance of things hoped for and the
[49:01] evidence of things not seen and then god
[49:03] bless you you can have your seats this
[49:04] evening man we want to continue our
[49:07] little series that we started on
[49:08] authority to believe and i want to take
[49:10] a very simple thought tonight of what is
[49:12] faith and then what is faith and we've
[49:15] been hearing a lot about faith and
[49:16] wisdom versus faith in these different
[49:18] things and i think for many of us we
[49:20] could take that one scripture and we
[49:21] could take the quote where brother
[49:22] braham said faith is a revelation of the
[49:24] will of god and we'd say brother
[49:25] jonathan how are you going to take a
[49:27] full service on that amen but we'll find
[49:29] there's more to it as we get into the
[49:30] word that there you know we want to
[49:32] expand on it we want to dig deeper into
[49:34] it so i'm going to teach a little bit
[49:35] tonight amen so just settle in we won't
[49:37] be too long but we men what do we do
[49:39] teaching for preaching is great we love
[49:41] the preaching because it's it's
[49:42] energetic and it you know it's dynamic
[49:45] and it can excite us in these different
[49:46] things but brother braham says teaching
[49:48] is to do what is to positionally place
[49:50] the believer amen he talks about the the
[49:52] he says i find there's two types of
[49:54] people he says there's the pentecostals
[49:55] and there's the fundamentalists he says
[49:57] the pentecostals they he says they they
[49:59] write checks but there's no money in the
[50:01] bank he said the fundamentalist he says
[50:03] they don't know how to write a check but
[50:04] they got tons of money in the bank he
[50:05] says if you could ever get two of them
[50:07] together then you'd have it and what was
[50:08] he saying he said one of them has faith
[50:11] but doesn't know how to use it and the
[50:13] other one has no faith but they keep
[50:15] saying that they're going to be doing
[50:16] something with it he meant he says you
[50:17] got to bring those two things together
[50:19] and so teaching is what gives us the
[50:20] structure it puts us on a sure
[50:22] foundation so that way when we do step
[50:24] out by faith and then when we do walk
[50:26] through life then we know that we're
[50:27] walking on a path that god has set and
[50:30] not one of our own making
[50:31] so i want to go back to that that verse
[50:33] in hebrews 11 verse 1 it says now faith
[50:36] is the substance of things hoped for the
[50:38] evidence of things not seen now in the
[50:40] amplified it says now faith is the
[50:42] assurance that is the confirmation the
[50:45] title deed
[50:46] something you can hold if we can put it
[50:48] that way the title deed of the things we
[50:50] hope for being the proof of things we do
[50:53] not see
[50:54] and the conviction of their reality in
[50:57] other words faith is perceiving as real
[50:59] fact what is not revealed to the senses
[51:01] so faith is not something that will show
[51:03] you something that your five senses can
[51:05] contact amen but it's something brother
[51:07] brown would even call faith the sixth
[51:08] sense that it is something outside of
[51:10] our natural senses and it is something
[51:12] that declares it to be real that word
[51:14] substance in the original language it
[51:16] means the substructure the foundation it
[51:19] says that which has actual existence a
[51:22] substance a real being brother branham
[51:23] would say faith what faith declares is
[51:25] more real than the very desk that i'm
[51:27] standing behind tonight amen he says
[51:29] that's how real faith is is that it it
[51:31] overrides anything you can see feel
[51:33] taste touch hear these different things
[51:35] amen
[51:36] so what the scripture says that faith is
[51:38] the foundation the structure the reality
[51:41] upon which you rest those things which
[51:43] you desire and hope for amen you can't
[51:44] touch it you can you can't put faith in
[51:47] your pocket and yet and let yet you know
[51:49] it is something real you know it's
[51:50] something that you have and so when you
[51:52] combine faith which is the foundation
[51:55] which hope with hope which is the desire
[51:57] you have that's when you get real belief
[51:59] amen faith is an expectation faith is
[52:02] forward-looking hope is really just a
[52:04] desire hope is you know we would say
[52:06] well i i hope i get a good job or i hope
[52:08] i meet a great guy in maryam or i hope i
[52:10] meet a great girl and marry her or i
[52:12] hope i win the lottery as many people in
[52:14] the world would say today it's all hope
[52:16] but there's no substance behind it and
[52:18] let's face it you have no more chance of
[52:20] winning the lottery than you do of
[52:21] walking off this earth without having a
[52:22] relationship with god it's not going to
[52:24] happen it'll happen for one but it'll
[52:26] have nothing to do with their faith amen
[52:28] it's going to be pure luck for them amen
[52:30] amen hope is something you want but you
[52:32] have no assurance that you're going to
[52:33] get it amen now it's not that hope is
[52:36] wrong paul said that we have what hope
[52:38] faith and love he says those abide with
[52:40] the believer we have a hope amen we have
[52:42] a blessed hope though not just a hope we
[52:44] have something that that god has told us
[52:46] to look towards and so we have a hope in
[52:48] our hearts that says i want what god has
[52:50] offered for me that god has promised to
[52:52] me amen but of those he said you have
[52:54] hope faith and charity or love he says
[52:56] of all those three love is the greatest
[52:58] not even faith was a grace he said love
[53:00] was the greatest thing of all of those
[53:02] amen so it's not wrong to have hope
[53:04] humanity is mostly hopeful i think
[53:07] hope springs eternal in the human nature
[53:09] i think but there is no rest in hope
[53:11] there's no joy in hope but it is just
[53:13] something that you have a dream about or
[53:15] an idea about and you start to think
[53:16] that maybe you could get it and it's a
[53:18] hope there's no there's no reality to it
[53:20] but faith is different faith is hope
[53:22] with substance amen faith is hope with
[53:25] purpose faith is hope with direction
[53:27] faith is hope with action it's hope with
[53:29] understanding and it's hope with
[53:30] expectation amen it takes the the
[53:33] ethereal part of hope and it brings it
[53:34] to something that you can now start to
[53:36] feel as solid and real
[53:38] now you can have human faith and i think
[53:40] sometimes that's what hope really is is
[53:41] it's human faith you have this idea you
[53:44] have this desire and so you have this
[53:45] hope and you start to think that maybe
[53:47] it's going to happen for some reason
[53:48] amen
[53:49] humanity has faith and brother brown
[53:51] talks about him we'll read some quotes
[53:52] and you'll you'll you can read about
[53:54] people and you hear about people that
[53:55] say i just knew it was going to happen
[53:57] and it happened
[53:58] and that comes down to human faith
[54:00] brother brown says there is a human
[54:02] faith and there is a power behind that
[54:03] human faith but that's not where we want
[54:05] to rest as believers amen we want to
[54:07] have the faith of god not the faith of
[54:09] humanity
[54:10] brother branham puts it this way he says
[54:11] so there is genuine faith but you must
[54:14] come into the real channel of god to
[54:16] have that genuine faith you say brother
[54:18] jonathan how do i get faith come into
[54:20] the real channel of god that's what
[54:22] we're looking for there's human faith
[54:24] then there's faith of god and you must
[54:26] have a godly faith to believe
[54:28] now brother brown's preaching to
[54:29] christians and he's saying to believe
[54:31] the word of god you've got to move past
[54:33] the human faith and into the faith of
[54:36] god not just faith in god but he says
[54:38] you've got to move into the faith of god
[54:41] he says i believe he's speaking here
[54:43] just before
[54:44] a prayer line he says if you will just
[54:46] be reverent and just take all the faith
[54:48] that you've got as human faith and turn
[54:50] it over into the hands of god and say
[54:53] now lord take my little that i got to
[54:56] give you and let your faith come to me
[54:58] so he says don't hold on to the human
[55:00] side don't hold on to the human faith he
[55:02] says take that and give it to god and
[55:04] say god let your faith now come to me
[55:06] i'm going to give up what i've got the
[55:08] thing i'm clinging to the little hope
[55:09] the little idea and i'm giving it to you
[55:12] and i'm letting you come now and give me
[55:13] your faith into my life
[55:15] he says i believe he'll heal you and let
[55:18] me call you right out from this platform
[55:20] without you even coming up here at all
[55:22] he says could you believe it he's
[55:24] challenging the faith of the people this
[55:26] is faith is our victory is the message
[55:28] he says there's only one faith and
[55:30] that's the faith of god that's right
[55:32] god's faith your human faith don't go
[55:34] very far
[55:36] it'll go somewhere but it won't go very
[55:37] far for the believer but god's faith in
[55:40] you makes you love everybody makes me
[55:43] love everybody that's right that's what
[55:46] god's faith does to you it makes you
[55:48] have the same feeling that jesus did
[55:50] because what
[55:51] the spirit of christ is in you i love
[55:54] how he says it makes me have that you
[55:56] have the same feeling not necessarily in
[55:58] human emotion amen but it makes you love
[56:01] everyone in a godly way or it makes you
[56:02] have a godly love it's an interesting
[56:05] concept because we tend to put faith in
[56:07] this box and say well faith is for
[56:09] healing or faith is for deliverance or
[56:11] faith is for provision and things like
[56:13] that but brother brahm says no no it's
[56:15] not quite that simple he says and faith
[56:17] and love is a relation because you can't
[56:20] have faith unless you've got love
[56:23] because your faith is in a god who is
[56:25] the very essence of love faith and love
[56:27] works together
[56:29] right if we look at first john 4 it says
[56:31] and we have known and believed the love
[56:33] that god had to us god is love and he
[56:36] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god
[56:39] and god in him
[56:40] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[56:43] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[56:45] because as he is so are we in this world
[56:48] amen not in the world to come but he
[56:50] says in this world now we're the same as
[56:52] christ
[56:54] there is no fear in love but perfect
[56:57] love casteth out fear not just love but
[57:00] he says perfect love casts out fear
[57:02] because fear had torment he that feareth
[57:05] is not made perfect in love
[57:08] now remember brother brahms talking now
[57:10] on a faith that will rapture you
[57:12] amen we're not just talking about faith
[57:14] that will deliver you or faith that will
[57:15] heal you we're talking about a faith
[57:17] that goes beyond that now we'll see as
[57:19] we go that there is no difference in the
[57:21] faith that heals you than the faith that
[57:22] raptures you it's the exact same faith
[57:24] there is no difference in it the
[57:26] question is how much you'll allow it to
[57:27] have an effect in your life really amen
[57:29] amen and we'll see as we go into it what
[57:31] that really is but he's talking about
[57:32] perfect faith which is the highest
[57:34] expression of faith that you can have
[57:36] and brother branham when he's talking
[57:37] about perfect faith what does he say
[57:39] he's talking about the other side and he
[57:41] says not but perfect faith can go there
[57:44] he says not but perfect love
[57:47] can enter there
[57:48] so we're talking about faith but he says
[57:50] it's going to take perfect love to get
[57:52] you over there not perfect faith you've
[57:54] got to have perfect love before you have
[57:55] perfect faith amen so what is it the
[57:58] faith of god must align with the love of
[58:00] god because god is love that's what he's
[58:02] saying if you're going to dwell in god
[58:03] then it's going to be in love so your
[58:05] faith is going to align with the way
[58:06] that god's love works now we know that
[58:08] god's love is not all cuddles and kisses
[58:10] and hugs
[58:11] if you're a child you've been spanked by
[58:12] god amen if you're a child of god you've
[58:14] been disciplined by god so his love is
[58:16] not always the one that makes you feel
[58:18] warm and fuzzy amen but it has so many
[58:20] aspects to it it's corrective it's
[58:22] supportive it's encouraging it's guiding
[58:24] and yes it's comforting and all those
[58:26] things we associate with love but it's
[58:27] not just a good feeling
[58:30] it's not just a good feeling god's love
[58:31] it's it's multifaceted amen brother
[58:34] brown will put it this way it says we
[58:35] don't take emotion now it takes faith
[58:38] and love
[58:39] he says lord i love you you couldn't lie
[58:42] because you're god i love you love
[58:44] settles the thing when you love your
[58:46] wife with all your heart with all your
[58:48] soul you just love her there ain't
[58:50] nobody in the town could make you
[58:51] believe she wasn't a good woman that's
[58:53] right see the same thing the old
[58:55] tattletails will come tell you your
[58:57] husband isn't true to you when you
[58:59] really love him and they've got
[59:00] confidence in him is that right love
[59:02] just covers it over that's all and when
[59:05] you love god all the fears just scatter
[59:08] everywhere and you just say god you're
[59:10] right
[59:12] god you're right doesn't matter what the
[59:15] skeptics are saying doesn't matter what
[59:16] the tattletails are saying it doesn't
[59:18] matter what the symptoms are saying it
[59:20] says love knowing that you love god and
[59:22] he's a god of love it will say god
[59:24] you're right
[59:26] and i love you and i'm healed and i just
[59:28] go on and take it he says that's it
[59:31] everything can happen spontaneously if
[59:33] you just believe it
[59:35] so often what happens is we're believing
[59:37] for healing we're believing for
[59:38] deliverance we're here we're believing
[59:40] for provision and what we're doing is
[59:42] we're believing we're believing we're
[59:43] believing and then we hit the point
[59:44] where faith comes into reality and
[59:46] that's when the work is done
[59:49] god was working all along but there's a
[59:51] moment where things change and you know
[59:52] it's a finished work i'll take you back
[59:54] to my sister elena she was believing for
[59:57] healing she was praying for healing
[59:58] everyone's believing and what happens is
[1:00:00] in a in a twinkling of an eye in a
[1:00:02] moment in a service she realizes i'm
[1:00:05] healed amen did she have faith prior to
[1:00:07] that of course she did but there's a
[1:00:09] moment where that reality comes in and
[1:00:10] that's what he's saying he's saying
[1:00:12] spontaneously you believe and it can
[1:00:14] happen right then and there it doesn't
[1:00:16] have to and it doesn't mean it will but
[1:00:18] he says when you believe it then it can
[1:00:19] happen right then and there there's
[1:00:20] nothing to hold it back amen
[1:00:22] so he's saying your love of god your
[1:00:24] trust that he is a loving god will bring
[1:00:26] you to faith that he will do what he was
[1:00:28] promised in his word that he will do
[1:00:30] he says why because you love me god and
[1:00:33] i love you
[1:00:34] love brings you to trust and that trust
[1:00:36] is where your faith starts
[1:00:38] amen you've got to trust that he's doing
[1:00:40] going to do what he said he would he
[1:00:41] says you take him at his word because
[1:00:43] you trust him and because you trust him
[1:00:45] you believe him and that's always got to
[1:00:47] be that first step there's always a
[1:00:49] first step and then after that once he
[1:00:50] proves himself then you just move
[1:00:52] further and further in your trust in
[1:00:53] your relationship with him
[1:00:56] brother brown would say this he says he
[1:00:58] caught me when i was nothing
[1:01:00] i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand
[1:01:04] and he loved me when i was unlovable he
[1:01:06] loved you when he was unlovable but he
[1:01:08] changed you
[1:01:09] can you say he's changed you
[1:01:12] just like the colored sister that time
[1:01:14] and her testimony she said i'm not what
[1:01:15] i ought to be i'm not what i want to be
[1:01:18] but then i'm not what i used to be she
[1:01:20] knew she had come somewhere something
[1:01:22] happened and that's the way it is if god
[1:01:25] when i was an alien from him so love me
[1:01:27] till he stooped down to get me and pick
[1:01:29] me up that gives me confidence that he
[1:01:33] wants to use me
[1:01:34] he doesn't pick somebody up if he
[1:01:36] doesn't want to use them
[1:01:38] so this is how simple faith is we're
[1:01:40] talking on what is faith and brother
[1:01:42] brown is bringing it back to the very
[1:01:44] choice of god and choosing you you
[1:01:46] didn't choose him he chose you he says
[1:01:48] because he chose you that means he's
[1:01:51] going to use you and that means you're
[1:01:52] going to have faith to bring the word to
[1:01:54] reality in your life
[1:01:56] it's as simple as he chose you therefore
[1:01:59] you will have faith and you do have
[1:02:01] faith to do what god has expected of you
[1:02:03] amen he stooped down to get me and pick
[1:02:06] me up that gives me confidence that he
[1:02:08] wants to use me he's got a purpose in
[1:02:10] doing it he's seen something in me
[1:02:13] he's seen something in you
[1:02:15] amen why because he picked you the same
[1:02:18] way he picked the prophet
[1:02:20] he says he had a reason to save you look
[1:02:23] at the people that's unsafe today and we
[1:02:24] look around we've got 35 40 people here
[1:02:27] and we've got 750 000 in newfoundland
[1:02:31] why us plus the folks in central maybe
[1:02:32] 60 or 70 people across the island out of
[1:02:35] 700 000 or 500 000 whatever it is why us
[1:02:39] because he's going to use you because he
[1:02:41] has a purpose for you he says look at
[1:02:43] the millions he could have took beside
[1:02:45] you but he took you amen no one can take
[1:02:49] your place amen you're in god's economy
[1:02:52] no one can do it that's his love to you
[1:02:55] then won't your love reach right back to
[1:02:58] him
[1:02:59] and there's a love affair no matter what
[1:03:01] the situation is its circumstances is
[1:03:04] governed by this love that creates faith
[1:03:07] that god loves you and you love god and
[1:03:09] you love one another and that brings the
[1:03:12] faith all right he says then it can't
[1:03:15] keep from bringing out just exactly what
[1:03:17] god promised it would do amen brother
[1:03:20] ron spencer any time he he he speaks to
[1:03:23] you know he he works with young men and
[1:03:25] young ministers and whatnot and you know
[1:03:26] what he always says to them brother ron
[1:03:28] how do i grow in ministry you know what
[1:03:30] he says fall in love with jesus
[1:03:32] fall in love with jesus oh should i
[1:03:34] study yeah you should study but you
[1:03:35] better love him before you start
[1:03:36] studying man because otherwise you're
[1:03:38] not going to do anybody to look a good
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:41] so we tend to look at ourselves and we
[1:03:42] say do i have faith
[1:03:44] but brother brahm takes us deeper and he
[1:03:46] says do you have love
[1:03:49] and when we say do you have love what he
[1:03:51] means is have you experienced love
[1:03:54] because if you've experienced love then
[1:03:56] faith will always follow with it is what
[1:03:57] he's saying and if you've experienced
[1:03:59] love that love will be reprojected back
[1:04:01] to god and it'll be reprojected to the
[1:04:03] people that you come in contact with
[1:04:05] every single day amen sometimes we have
[1:04:07] plenty of faith in the general sense but
[1:04:09] the question is then do you have love to
[1:04:11] make that faith work the way it ought to
[1:04:13] amen look it you want you want to see
[1:04:16] the perfect expression of faith for this
[1:04:17] hour
[1:04:18] look at brother branham and he's going
[1:04:20] to pray for somebody remember and he
[1:04:22] walks into the field where that bull is
[1:04:24] laying under the tree and what does he
[1:04:25] do he startles the bull out of its sleep
[1:04:28] and it gets up and it starts to paw on
[1:04:30] the ground it's going to charge him
[1:04:31] brother bram says he was going to kill
[1:04:33] me
[1:04:34] now
[1:04:35] most people today would stand up and
[1:04:37] they would say i am the prophet of the
[1:04:40] lord thus saith the lord get back under
[1:04:43] that tree don't you come near me
[1:04:46] why
[1:04:47] i've got faith
[1:04:48] what if brother branham said he
[1:04:49] projected there
[1:04:51] what did he say he said i'm sorry
[1:04:54] i disturbed you
[1:04:56] i didn't realize you were there
[1:04:59] he says but i'm on a mission for the
[1:05:01] king.
[1:05:03] he says so you're going to have to just
[1:05:04] go and lay down
[1:05:06] because i'm on his business
[1:05:08] he says and that bull just basically
[1:05:10] blank turned around walked and didn't
[1:05:11] even look at him another time
[1:05:13] what was it love projected amen and
[1:05:17] faith
[1:05:18] was operational in it the love made the
[1:05:20] faith do the right thing
[1:05:22] because what he was on the king's
[1:05:24] mission but he wasn't there to rule with
[1:05:25] a rod of iron
[1:05:27] he was there to rule with love
[1:05:30] because what christ rules us with love
[1:05:32] so the expression of christ to us is
[1:05:34] always going to be god's love and so the
[1:05:36] perfect expression of faith will be
[1:05:38] through god's perfect love
[1:05:40] you've got to have them in alignment
[1:05:41] amen
[1:05:43] so faith we see is what
[1:05:45] faith to believe for something that god
[1:05:47] has promised each and every one of us
[1:05:49] amen if we can find it in his word he
[1:05:51] says perfect love is the only thing can
[1:05:53] enter there amen
[1:05:55] but what we've got to miss we've got to
[1:05:56] find the intention of the holy spirit
[1:05:59] that's when you can have true faith is
[1:06:00] when you can find the will of god and
[1:06:01] we'll get into that maybe in the next
[1:06:03] service lord willing amen we have faith
[1:06:05] often to believe for something but
[1:06:06] because it's personal or selfish then
[1:06:08] god can't honor it
[1:06:10] we've got a personal intent rather than
[1:06:11] a love of god or a kingdom of god effect
[1:06:13] that we're looking for amen
[1:06:15] but when we look at faith he says it's
[1:06:17] substance it's real it's tangible that
[1:06:19] you have it and then paul takes us
[1:06:21] further and he says it's not just
[1:06:22] substance real but he says it's evidence
[1:06:25] it's proof
[1:06:27] that word evidence means that by which a
[1:06:29] thing is proved or tested a conviction
[1:06:31] an assurance of reality and truth so
[1:06:34] when you have faith that faith itself is
[1:06:37] the evidence that something is coming
[1:06:38] your way
[1:06:39] amen so it's something that's real but
[1:06:41] the fact that you have faith in the
[1:06:43] first place as a believer is proof that
[1:06:45] god is going to answer your prayer
[1:06:47] because that faith comes from him
[1:06:50] it's something that he gives amen and
[1:06:51] we'll see why that is in a little bit
[1:06:53] but if you don't have faith then there's
[1:06:54] nothing coming but if you have faith
[1:06:56] then it shows that god's given you faith
[1:06:58] because there's something coming down
[1:06:59] the road amen faith gives you insight
[1:07:01] into what god's doing
[1:07:03] so you know what to expect and you're
[1:07:04] looking for it and you're an expectation
[1:07:06] amen
[1:07:07] it's kind of like when you go to costco
[1:07:09] now i don't know if anybody's bought any
[1:07:11] high-end electronics at costco but when
[1:07:13] you go to costco if you want to buy an
[1:07:15] ipad you can't just walk up and take an
[1:07:17] ipad have you ever noticed that they've
[1:07:19] got the ones out there that show you
[1:07:20] what it looks like and you can play
[1:07:21] around with it but if you want to buy an
[1:07:23] ipad what do you do you go and you take
[1:07:25] that cardboard tag off of the wall and
[1:07:27] you take it up to the desk and you say i
[1:07:29] want an ipad
[1:07:31] that's what faith is like
[1:07:33] i've got the ipad tag in my hand
[1:07:36] that means as long as i paid for that
[1:07:38] ipad i'm going to get an ipad
[1:07:41] faith is the evidence
[1:07:43] that one there's an ipad available that
[1:07:46] two there's a price on it if you pay the
[1:07:47] price you can get an ipad now i might go
[1:07:49] up there and i hand that to them and i
[1:07:51] pay for it now i might get an ipad in 30
[1:07:53] seconds or i might get an ipad in 10
[1:07:55] minutes depending on how busy they are
[1:07:57] maybe it's way back in the corner and
[1:07:58] they've got to go up and and get a
[1:08:00] forklift or something to get them down
[1:08:01] or something like that but i know that
[1:08:03] if the price has been paid
[1:08:05] and that i've got the tag there that
[1:08:06] says that an ipad's in the warehouse i'm
[1:08:08] getting an ipad at one moment or another
[1:08:10] aren't they
[1:08:12] so it's the beautiful thing is that with
[1:08:13] that merchandise take it's the same as
[1:08:15] the word of god amen you have a promise
[1:08:18] that's written on the tag faith takes it
[1:08:21] and you take it up and you go to the
[1:08:22] register and you say i want what's on
[1:08:24] this tag
[1:08:25] but here's the difference you don't have
[1:08:27] to pay for it
[1:08:28] it's already been paid for remember
[1:08:30] brother brown says he says just walk in
[1:08:32] the store and start taking what you want
[1:08:33] off the shelves because it's all open
[1:08:35] for you you just have to take it
[1:08:38] and then i think sometimes that's the
[1:08:40] biggest problem is we think that we've
[1:08:41] got to go pay a price to get what god
[1:08:44] has already freely offered to us and
[1:08:46] what happens is we get in our own way
[1:08:47] and we start tripping over our own
[1:08:49] humanity and our own flaws and failures
[1:08:51] and these different things and it bogs
[1:08:53] us down when god says look the price is
[1:08:54] paid just bring the tag up let your
[1:08:56] faith be the evidence that there's
[1:08:58] something there and go up and redeem it
[1:08:59] from the from the front desk that's all
[1:09:02] he's asking us to do amen
[1:09:04] amen aside from having to be obedient so
[1:09:07] in obedience to the word there's nothing
[1:09:08] you can do to add to or make you more
[1:09:11] worthy to get a redemptive blessing from
[1:09:13] god
[1:09:14] it's a redemptive blessing it's given to
[1:09:15] you it's part of your redemption
[1:09:17] so you don't add to it you can't add
[1:09:19] anything to it all that god has ever
[1:09:21] required is that you be in obedience to
[1:09:23] his word when you come believing brother
[1:09:24] rahm says if you can meet the
[1:09:25] requirements of the of the first person
[1:09:27] that got it then you'll get it every
[1:09:29] single time
[1:09:31] he says here he says
[1:09:33] it's like this if i told you with all my
[1:09:35] heart if you were hungry and starving to
[1:09:36] death and you had supreme confidence in
[1:09:39] me as a truthful person and i told you
[1:09:41] where there was a thousand dollars lane
[1:09:43] how you'd get to it what road you go
[1:09:45] exactly where to go to and you
[1:09:46] understand exactly where the money is
[1:09:48] laying see then you would start
[1:09:50] rejoicing right then just the same as if
[1:09:53] you had the money if you believe me
[1:09:57] so you see before you're ever feeling
[1:09:59] any different or anything else you can
[1:10:01] be just as happy over your healing and
[1:10:03] saying you got it because you are
[1:10:05] positive sure you've got it because you
[1:10:07] got confidence in the one that promised
[1:10:09] it to you
[1:10:10] we're talking about what is faith now he
[1:10:13] says your c your confidence is that he
[1:10:16] cannot lie
[1:10:19] and he's told you exactly where it was
[1:10:21] laying at and then you got confidence
[1:10:23] that you're going you got it already
[1:10:26] because that is your faith which is the
[1:10:28] earnest of your redemption in other
[1:10:30] words you're trying to be redeemed from
[1:10:32] sickness and your faith is the earnest
[1:10:34] of your healing
[1:10:36] as long as something says in your heart
[1:10:39] i'm the lord that heals you that's just
[1:10:41] as good that's all you need or you can
[1:10:43] start just as happy no matter what
[1:10:45] happens
[1:10:46] if you don't get it
[1:10:48] if you get worse you're still just as
[1:10:51] happy as you was you was perfectly well
[1:10:54] because you've got the assurance that
[1:10:56] it's over how many understands that now
[1:10:59] let's see your hand he says there you
[1:11:00] are it's the evidence of things not not
[1:11:03] seen so faith is something that is real
[1:11:05] to you and then he says faith is
[1:11:07] something that holds you because it's
[1:11:08] the evidence that something is coming
[1:11:10] your way
[1:11:11] faith is your proof that god is moving
[1:11:12] on your behalf and you're going to get
[1:11:14] your answer back with results amen
[1:11:17] now that sounds great and we all want to
[1:11:19] have it but let's tie it down
[1:11:20] specifically to what faith is what is
[1:11:23] real faith for a believer
[1:11:25] this is anointed ones at the end time
[1:11:27] five months to the day before brother
[1:11:28] branham died
[1:11:30] he says what is faith
[1:11:32] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:11:34] you
[1:11:34] that is not yet but you believe it will
[1:11:38] be faith is a revelation of the will of
[1:11:41] god
[1:11:42] very simple
[1:11:43] very simple
[1:11:45] but yet it gets so complicated sometimes
[1:11:47] because the thing is it's like we talked
[1:11:49] about the beginning you got people
[1:11:51] writing checks and there's no money in
[1:11:52] the bank why because they're not in
[1:11:54] alignment with the will of god you've
[1:11:55] got to find the will of god to have
[1:11:56] faith
[1:11:58] you don't just have faith for anything
[1:11:59] this is not a prosperity doctrine or
[1:12:01] anything else this is not a career
[1:12:03] prosperity or a marriage prosperity
[1:12:05] doctrine or anything like that you've
[1:12:06] got to find the will of god because
[1:12:08] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:15] so if we know there's one thing when it
[1:12:17] comes to faith it's that it cannot be
[1:12:19] contrary to the will of god you can't
[1:12:20] have the faith of god and be contrary to
[1:12:22] the will of god and what is the will of
[1:12:24] god it's his word it's always his word
[1:12:26] you can't have faith in something that
[1:12:28] is contrary to the word of god amen i
[1:12:30] know this is basic and i'm teaching but
[1:12:32] we want it to be basic amen if you're
[1:12:34] building on a foundation it better be
[1:12:35] simple and it better be solid amen we
[1:12:38] don't want to turn this into anything
[1:12:39] complicated he says a man and a woman is
[1:12:42] one and christ is one body the word the
[1:12:45] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:12:46] body and the two together makes the one
[1:12:48] body again like adam was at the
[1:12:50] beginning man and his wife are one now
[1:12:53] she the true bride is so sold out to him
[1:12:55] that she uses no mind of her own his
[1:12:58] mind of course is his will
[1:13:00] and his will is his word his will is his
[1:13:04] word that makes it so simple amen
[1:13:07] remember in our first service where we
[1:13:08] read that quote where the of the woman
[1:13:10] at the well and brother branham says she
[1:13:12] had scriptural authority to believe
[1:13:14] why because she could take her
[1:13:15] experience back to the word of god
[1:13:18] that's how she knew that she could
[1:13:19] believe that that was the messiah was
[1:13:21] because her experience matched what the
[1:13:22] word said that he was going to do amen
[1:13:24] and that's where the believer rests is
[1:13:26] when you can read in the word what is
[1:13:28] supposed to happen and your faith lines
[1:13:30] up with that then you said then it's got
[1:13:31] to happen that's the only way it's going
[1:13:33] to go is if it lines up with the word of
[1:13:35] god amen there might be situations we
[1:13:37] get into and maybe we can't find a
[1:13:39] scripture we don't have one necessarily
[1:13:41] at that moment but when you do find that
[1:13:43] scripture when you do find that word and
[1:13:45] it's solid from genesis to revelation
[1:13:48] because let's face it we got lots of
[1:13:49] people will post one scripture from one
[1:13:51] place and say that's the will of god and
[1:13:53] they don't run it through from the start
[1:13:54] to the end and they get out of balance
[1:13:56] that's how you get prosperity doctrine
[1:13:58] right it's because they say that god
[1:14:00] wants to bless you and all these
[1:14:01] different things but no no no it says
[1:14:03] you've got to be in obedience to god and
[1:14:04] you've got to worship him with all your
[1:14:06] heart soul and mind and these different
[1:14:07] things and they say no no god just wants
[1:14:09] to bless me and that's what i'm going to
[1:14:10] focus on right you got to pull it from
[1:14:12] genesis to revelation but when you've
[1:14:13] run that scriptural promise through from
[1:14:15] start to end then now you can rest on it
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:19] we can have confidence in that we're in
[1:14:20] the will of his god
[1:14:22] we're in the will of god rather so when
[1:14:23] we take on this concept of his will as
[1:14:25] his word everything else falls into
[1:14:27] place
[1:14:28] because you can't be selfish and be in
[1:14:30] god's will
[1:14:31] right you can't be prideful in being
[1:14:33] god's will you can't be image conscious
[1:14:34] and be in god's will because love works
[1:14:36] with faith and so the things you ask of
[1:14:39] god will reflect that love
[1:14:41] and that love of god is always for one
[1:14:42] purpose and that is for the benefit of
[1:14:44] the kingdom of heaven
[1:14:46] always
[1:14:47] it's not for the benefit of you
[1:14:49] personally it's for the benefit of the
[1:14:51] kingdom of god and that's how it works
[1:14:52] and operates amen
[1:14:54] we had a uh an interesting time a week
[1:14:57] or two ago we had a hispanic immigrant
[1:14:59] family over to our house and jonathan
[1:15:01] met him at a camp there and said he was
[1:15:03] really nice and of course my wife being
[1:15:05] hispanic she wants to you know connect
[1:15:07] with anybody like that so we had the
[1:15:08] mower to the house and and and blanca
[1:15:11] took them over to the lottery home
[1:15:12] that's that's up for the lottery now
[1:15:14] i don't play the lottery i don't play
[1:15:16] those lotteries either and and as they
[1:15:18] were walking over there this family has
[1:15:20] nothing they left everything behind in
[1:15:22] in mexico they had good jobs and and
[1:15:24] whatnot and they came here she barely
[1:15:26] speaks any english he speaks a little
[1:15:27] bit the boys are are doing quite well
[1:15:29] but they left everything behind to come
[1:15:31] here and they're in this little tiny
[1:15:32] apartment and they have no vehicles and
[1:15:35] they don't have anything
[1:15:36] and as they were walking there i thought
[1:15:38] how neat it would be if they won the
[1:15:39] lottery home now they don't play the
[1:15:41] lottery either because they're
[1:15:42] professing christians
[1:15:44] but i thought if they did play the
[1:15:45] lottery how neat it would be if they won
[1:15:48] the home
[1:15:49] because you know what most of us would
[1:15:51] say well we'd say well i've got faith
[1:15:52] that i'm going to win the lottery home
[1:15:55] but guess what we all have houses that
[1:15:57] serve our needs
[1:15:58] but yet we would apply that faith
[1:16:00] selfishly to say well it's for me and in
[1:16:02] the meantime god's already given you
[1:16:03] everything you have need of
[1:16:05] and yet we sit there and we want to have
[1:16:07] faith for something that would help us
[1:16:08] know that faith should be for the
[1:16:10] benefit of somebody that actually has a
[1:16:11] need rather than to give you more than
[1:16:13] you actually have need of i mean what is
[1:16:15] it it's a faith that's looking out not
[1:16:16] just for yourself but it's for somebody
[1:16:18] else it's for the benefit of others amen
[1:16:20] amen we don't want to get caught up in
[1:16:22] getting ahead we want to get caught up
[1:16:23] into getting into heavenly places amen
[1:16:26] that's what we're looking for that's the
[1:16:27] reason that brother branham i believe in
[1:16:29] that i'm tying love and faith together
[1:16:30] here has become we come to the place
[1:16:33] where jesus himself the greatest faith
[1:16:35] worker the greatest healer that ever
[1:16:37] walked on the earth he had a great
[1:16:39] purpose here and it was not to lift
[1:16:40] himself up
[1:16:43] it wasn't to lift himself up
[1:16:45] what was it what was his purpose we go
[1:16:48] in john 4. this is right after he spoken
[1:16:50] to the woman at the well and remember
[1:16:52] they come back and they say you know
[1:16:54] do you want meat and he says i have meat
[1:16:56] of which you know nothing
[1:16:58] and they said what are you talking about
[1:16:59] and he says jesus said unto them my meat
[1:17:02] is to do the will of him that sent me
[1:17:04] and to finish his work
[1:17:06] so the faith that jesus had was to do
[1:17:08] one thing and that was to do the will of
[1:17:10] the father and to finish the work that
[1:17:12] the father had given him to do on this
[1:17:14] earth and that's only what that faith
[1:17:16] was applied for he wasn't going out
[1:17:18] trying to establish a kingdom trying to
[1:17:19] establish a ministry trying to get a a
[1:17:22] great home or a great temple or take
[1:17:23] over build up a big apostolic army but
[1:17:26] it was to do the will of his father and
[1:17:28] to finish the work that he'd been sent
[1:17:30] to do so he's saying my meat my
[1:17:31] satisfaction what fulfills me is to do
[1:17:35] the will of the father
[1:17:37] so that's where his faith came from was
[1:17:40] because he was doing the will of the
[1:17:42] father in every aspect of his life
[1:17:45] he was looking always for the will we
[1:17:47] look for the faith and that's our
[1:17:49] problem we're not supposed to look for
[1:17:51] the faith we look for the will and then
[1:17:52] the faith will follow amen that's how
[1:17:54] you get that's how you get faith as you
[1:17:56] look for the will of god when you find
[1:17:58] the will of god then you can have the
[1:17:59] faith to claim it amen so jesus he had
[1:18:02] no thought of his own he had no ego he
[1:18:04] had no image concerns no hang-ups with
[1:18:06] how people perceived him
[1:18:08] amen why because they had nothing to do
[1:18:11] with what fulfilled him
[1:18:14] that's why we care about what other
[1:18:15] people say and think it's because it has
[1:18:16] an impact on us for jesus he didn't care
[1:18:18] he didn't give a flip
[1:18:20] right why because he was looking to do
[1:18:22] the will of the father and as long as
[1:18:24] his father said this is my beloved son
[1:18:26] in whom i'm pleased to dwell that was
[1:18:28] fine with jesus that's all he was
[1:18:30] looking for was what that point of
[1:18:31] adoption where god said hey
[1:18:33] that's my son
[1:18:35] hear him
[1:18:36] that's what we're looking for isn't it
[1:18:38] we talk about speaking the word but can
[1:18:40] you come to the place where you say the
[1:18:41] only thing that i'm that i'm satisfied
[1:18:43] with and the only thing i'm seeking is
[1:18:44] the will of god in my life
[1:18:46] so often i appreciated brother david's
[1:18:48] prayer he says the fervent prayer of a
[1:18:50] righteous man availeth much and so often
[1:18:52] we think that's prayer to change the
[1:18:54] situation
[1:18:55] it's not it's prayer to catch the will
[1:18:57] of god so we'll know how to approach the
[1:18:59] situation amen amen that's what we're
[1:19:01] looking for is our prayer is not to
[1:19:03] change god or or anything like that but
[1:19:05] it's to catch the mind of god so we know
[1:19:07] how to go into life and how we walk
[1:19:08] through these different things
[1:19:11] let's bring it down on on on our
[1:19:14] personal level amen
[1:19:17] romans 12 verse 1 says i beseech you
[1:19:19] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[1:19:22] that you present your bodies a living
[1:19:24] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which
[1:19:26] is your reasonable service he's saying
[1:19:28] do the same thing jesus did
[1:19:30] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:19:33] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:19:35] mind that you may prove what is that
[1:19:38] good
[1:19:39] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:19:44] for i say through the grace given unto
[1:19:46] me to every man that is among you not to
[1:19:49] think of himself more highly than he
[1:19:51] ought to think but to think soberly
[1:19:54] according as god had dealt to every man
[1:19:56] the measure of faith so paul says listen
[1:19:59] you've got one job to do and that is to
[1:20:01] prove the will of god
[1:20:04] that is the purpose of the believer is
[1:20:06] to do and prove the will of god in your
[1:20:09] lives amen
[1:20:10] now listen that takes a renewing of your
[1:20:12] mind
[1:20:14] because you've got to now think like god
[1:20:15] we've got to take on the mind of christ
[1:20:18] and we don't have that right now we used
[1:20:20] to have it when we were back in the
[1:20:22] beginning before time began before we
[1:20:24] fell into sin we had the mind of christ
[1:20:26] but we dropped out of it we have no
[1:20:28] recollection and now through our
[1:20:30] redemptive process we have a renewing of
[1:20:32] your mind paul says and that renewing
[1:20:35] means that we've got work to do
[1:20:37] that we don't just get baptized with the
[1:20:39] holy spirit and we immediately have the
[1:20:41] mind of christ in all things it's a
[1:20:42] renewing it's something that's
[1:20:44] constantly working in us to bring us
[1:20:46] back to the fullness of the mind of
[1:20:48] christ in our lives each and every one
[1:20:50] we were part and parcel with him we're
[1:20:52] going to be part and parcel with him
[1:20:54] again but there's a renewing that has to
[1:20:56] happen in between amen as we drop down
[1:20:58] into time we lost that mind of christ
[1:21:00] and we've got to come by the holy spirit
[1:21:02] now and bring that back into us amen
[1:21:04] because what he's making us new he's
[1:21:06] making us back into what we used to be
[1:21:08] renewing he's making us new again
[1:21:11] that's what he's doing in our lives amen
[1:21:13] but as we mature paul says as we get
[1:21:15] closer he says
[1:21:17] he says don't think more highly of
[1:21:18] yourself he says don't get proud as you
[1:21:21] start to catch the mind of christ as you
[1:21:23] start to get mature as your prayer life
[1:21:25] starts to grow and god starts to show
[1:21:28] you what's supposed to be going on in
[1:21:29] life and you willingly step into it and
[1:21:31] things start to happen and god starts to
[1:21:34] move in your life he says don't get
[1:21:35] proud no
[1:21:37] because why he says what every man has
[1:21:41] been given a measure of faith
[1:21:43] remember the parable he says that when
[1:21:44] that when the fruit comes when the wheat
[1:21:46] grows some are 30 fold some are 60 fold
[1:21:49] some are a hundred fold
[1:21:51] who determined that
[1:21:53] it wasn't the wheat
[1:21:55] it's a measure that god gives each and
[1:21:56] every one of us so brother mark might
[1:21:58] have a great measure of faith and i
[1:22:00] might have a small measure of faith
[1:22:01] sister maurins might be public and
[1:22:03] josh's might be private as the case may
[1:22:05] be but regardless of what you have he
[1:22:07] says don't get prideful because it's
[1:22:09] still the grace of god to you in the
[1:22:10] first place because it's god that gives
[1:22:12] you those things
[1:22:14] it's god that puts these things into
[1:22:15] your life amen i've said it so many
[1:22:17] times recently that humility is power
[1:22:19] with god
[1:22:20] amen and when we talk about ourselves
[1:22:22] when we lift ourselves up when we put
[1:22:24] ourselves into the image then guess what
[1:22:26] the mirror breaks
[1:22:28] because we can't be in there jonathan
[1:22:30] corlett must decrease so that christ can
[1:22:32] increase in my life amen
[1:22:35] it's god that's working in us
[1:22:37] and sometimes it's so easy
[1:22:39] where you just say boy i knew that was
[1:22:41] going to happen and i looked for it and
[1:22:42] it happened yeah yeah yeah no no stay
[1:22:44] humble
[1:22:45] stay sober keep looking to christ give
[1:22:47] the glory to god and let him continue
[1:22:49] working in your life amen and when you
[1:22:51] do that paul says now you can tap into
[1:22:54] the very faith of jesus christ
[1:22:57] sometimes we only have the mind of
[1:22:59] christ in a certain area
[1:23:01] we have doors that are locked in our
[1:23:03] lives if we were to be honest in many
[1:23:04] times but when we open it and we give
[1:23:06] him the opportunity when we we come to a
[1:23:08] crossroads when we come to a decision
[1:23:10] when we when we're dealing with a
[1:23:12] certain thing and we come and we say
[1:23:13] lord i want your will i want to know
[1:23:15] your mind i want to know your thoughts i
[1:23:17] want to know what you think about this
[1:23:19] that gives him the opportunity to give
[1:23:21] us the mind of christ for that moment
[1:23:22] and really that's what matters most is
[1:23:24] in that moment doesn't it when you've
[1:23:25] got to make a decision when you've got
[1:23:27] to take a step when you've got to go
[1:23:28] forward you want to do it with the mind
[1:23:30] of christ in that area and then as you
[1:23:32] grow and mature and those things start
[1:23:33] to open more and more and more now it
[1:23:35] gets easier and easier and easier
[1:23:36] because there's less and less to get
[1:23:38] there to hinder your faith amen
[1:23:41] listen to what paul says here in
[1:23:42] galatians 2 20 says i am crucified with
[1:23:45] christ nevertheless i live yet not i but
[1:23:48] christ liveth in me and the life which i
[1:23:51] now live in the flesh
[1:23:53] don't look ahead
[1:23:55] the flesh is now he says the life i live
[1:23:58] now in the flesh i live by the faith of
[1:24:02] the son of god who loved me and gave
[1:24:04] himself for me he didn't say i live by
[1:24:07] faith of the son of god he says i live
[1:24:09] by the faith
[1:24:11] that is specific in particular
[1:24:14] he says that we live by the faith of the
[1:24:16] son of god which is jesus christ the
[1:24:18] prophet of god puts us this way he says
[1:24:20] in acts 3 16 when peter was asked how
[1:24:22] the mighty miracle had taken place upon
[1:24:24] the crippled one at the gate beautiful
[1:24:26] he explained it in this wise he said and
[1:24:28] his name jesus name through faith in his
[1:24:31] name jesus name has made this man this
[1:24:34] former strong yea the faith
[1:24:36] which is by and from jesus had given him
[1:24:40] this man this perfect soundness in the
[1:24:42] presence of you all see there it is
[1:24:45] jesus name and jesus faith brought about
[1:24:47] the miracle peter did not claim it was
[1:24:49] his own human faith any more than he
[1:24:51] claimed it was with his it was his own
[1:24:53] name he said that jesus name used in the
[1:24:56] faith which is from jesus perform that
[1:24:59] great work
[1:25:00] this faith is what the lord was speaking
[1:25:03] about in revelations 2 13 it was his
[1:25:06] faith it was not faith in him
[1:25:11] but it was his own faith that he had
[1:25:13] given to the believers romans 12 3 says
[1:25:16] according as god had dealt to every man
[1:25:18] and according to verse one the men are
[1:25:19] brethren so he's talking to believers
[1:25:21] the measure of faith ephesians 2 8 says
[1:25:24] by grace are you saved through faith and
[1:25:26] that faith is not of yourself it is a
[1:25:28] gift of god it also says in james 2 1 my
[1:25:30] brethren again talking to brethren have
[1:25:33] not the faith of our lord jesus christ
[1:25:36] with respect to persons
[1:25:38] in this pergamy and age where men were
[1:25:40] humanizing salvation having turned from
[1:25:42] the truth that salvation is of the lord
[1:25:44] and having cast aside the doctrine of
[1:25:46] election and opened wide the church door
[1:25:49] and their fellowship to any and all who
[1:25:51] dis who subscribed to their tenants
[1:25:54] never mind the word in this age of rapid
[1:25:56] degradation there were still the few who
[1:25:59] had the measure of that faith of our
[1:26:01] lord jesus christ and not only used that
[1:26:04] faith in acts of power but withstood
[1:26:06] those who dared to say that they were
[1:26:08] saved simply on the grounds of joining a
[1:26:10] church
[1:26:11] they knew no man could truly believe
[1:26:14] unto eternal life and the righteousness
[1:26:16] of god apart from the measure of faith
[1:26:18] of the lord jesus himself
[1:26:22] casa where he says what they open why
[1:26:24] the church doors and their fellowships
[1:26:26] to any and all who subscribe to their
[1:26:27] tenants
[1:26:28] guess what that can happen in the
[1:26:30] message
[1:26:32] i believe what brother branham said
[1:26:34] you're saved you're going in the rapture
[1:26:35] and it's furthest from the truth
[1:26:38] because that's the same thing that the
[1:26:39] the scribes and the pharisees had i
[1:26:41] believe what the word says great you're
[1:26:43] going in it no no no no no you've got to
[1:26:45] step way beyond that my friend
[1:26:48] way beyond that that's a starting place
[1:26:51] it's not a finishing place
[1:26:54] he says as today's church is filled with
[1:26:56] mental believers who endorse the virgin
[1:26:58] birth the shed blood going to church and
[1:27:01] taking communion and are not reborn at
[1:27:04] all even so in that third age was the
[1:27:06] same problem human faith wasn't enough
[1:27:08] then and it is not enough now it takes
[1:27:11] the very faith of the son of god to drop
[1:27:14] into a man's heart so that he can
[1:27:16] receive the lord of glory into the
[1:27:18] temple not made with hands this was a
[1:27:22] living faith
[1:27:25] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:27:27] paul did not say he lived by faith in
[1:27:29] the son of god it was the faith of the
[1:27:32] son of god that had given him life and
[1:27:34] kept him living in christian victory
[1:27:37] amen
[1:27:38] you know what i love about this faith
[1:27:41] it's not mine
[1:27:43] not mine has nothing to do with me i can
[1:27:46] add to it and i can't take away from it
[1:27:49] everything that i need is in the faith
[1:27:51] of jesus christ because guess what he
[1:27:54] laid down his life he took it up again
[1:27:56] he healed the sick he raised the dead he
[1:27:58] delivered everything that we would ever
[1:28:00] want we saw in the life of jesus christ
[1:28:02] and he says this is no different than
[1:28:04] the faith that you receive it is the
[1:28:06] same faith that the believer receives
[1:28:08] today when they get the holy ghost it is
[1:28:10] the faith of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:12] himself in your life that keeps that
[1:28:15] that he says what that gives you life
[1:28:17] and keeps you living in christian
[1:28:19] victory amen it's not by your faith we
[1:28:21] sing that song something keeps holding
[1:28:23] me
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:25] is it me
[1:28:26] what they say brother branham did you
[1:28:28] keep your religion that said no what my
[1:28:30] religion kept me what is it it's the
[1:28:31] life it's the faith of christ inside of
[1:28:33] him amen
[1:28:35] so it's not mine to give it's not mine
[1:28:36] to grow it's not the mind to make it
[1:28:38] happen but all it is is accepting the
[1:28:41] very faith of jesus christ into my life
[1:28:43] how can i grow that faith
[1:28:46] i can't grow that faith it is it's the
[1:28:48] all-encompassing faith like i said that
[1:28:50] faith did everything we'd ever look for
[1:28:52] including a resurrection and a rapture
[1:28:54] amen so if it'll do that then i can't
[1:28:56] add to it
[1:28:58] i certainly can't diminish it but what i
[1:29:00] can do is i can affect how much i allow
[1:29:02] into my life
[1:29:03] as in how much i allow it into my life
[1:29:06] brother brown we talk about things that
[1:29:07] hinder our faith
[1:29:09] that's what i can do is get the
[1:29:10] hindrances out of the way that's that's
[1:29:12] something that i can look for that's
[1:29:14] something that i can work on is take
[1:29:15] away brother brown what color as paul
[1:29:17] did the sins that so easily beset us he
[1:29:19] says that's unbelief
[1:29:21] i can get the unbelief out so that faith
[1:29:23] can take its place that's all we're
[1:29:25] looking to do is that faith would
[1:29:26] overwhelm unbelief if we were to have a
[1:29:28] see-saw we've got unbelief here and
[1:29:30] we've got faith here all i'm looking to
[1:29:31] do is get enough faith off there so that
[1:29:33] faith can hit the ground unbelief get
[1:29:35] that off light enough that faith can hit
[1:29:36] the ground and finish the work
[1:29:38] it's all we're looking i mean i can
[1:29:40] adjust the effect because i can adjust
[1:29:42] what i allow into my life and i can take
[1:29:43] out things in my life
[1:29:45] but it's all about surrender in this
[1:29:47] case then right i can't make myself
[1:29:49] faith
[1:29:51] but i can take what i have and let it
[1:29:52] take an effect in my life
[1:29:55] so the key to the believer
[1:29:57] when they have faith that very faith of
[1:30:00] jesus christ is down to one thing and
[1:30:01] that's accept it and allow it to work in
[1:30:03] you
[1:30:04] don't hinder it don't hinder it don't do
[1:30:06] things that would hinder it don't hang
[1:30:07] around with people that would hinder it
[1:30:09] right don't fill your life with things
[1:30:10] that would hinder it from and this is me
[1:30:13] speaking from experience usually what
[1:30:14] that means is getting something out of
[1:30:16] the way
[1:30:17] and there's three things i have mark
[1:30:18] down here unbelief
[1:30:20] fear
[1:30:21] self-preservation
[1:30:24] that's it
[1:30:25] scared
[1:30:26] don't think it's real in the first place
[1:30:28] or you're trying to protect something
[1:30:30] and a lot of times it's ego and that
[1:30:31] facade that you have on the outside amen
[1:30:34] brother braham says this he says the
[1:30:35] super sense is the holy spirit what is
[1:30:38] the holy spirit it's the faith of god
[1:30:40] that dwells in you that's what he calls
[1:30:41] the holy spirit the faith of god that
[1:30:43] dwells in you and if you'll let the five
[1:30:45] senses be yielded to the sixth sense
[1:30:48] it'll guide you and bring all the other
[1:30:50] five senses under control of that super
[1:30:52] sense for it's so far above the natural
[1:30:54] sense as the spiritual man is above the
[1:30:56] natural it's as far as high as the
[1:30:58] heavens is above the natural man and his
[1:31:00] five senses it makes you believe things
[1:31:03] you cannot see
[1:31:04] it makes you act where you do not think
[1:31:06] the five senses would ever think about
[1:31:08] it the devil can get into these five
[1:31:10] senses and lie to you but he cannot
[1:31:12] touch that super sense that's far beyond
[1:31:15] his reach that come from god it's called
[1:31:18] faith and faith is that great thing
[1:31:21] he says the five senses do not control
[1:31:23] the sixth sense but the sixth sense
[1:31:25] controls the five senses the super sense
[1:31:27] controls the natural senses and the five
[1:31:30] senses is see taste feel smell here and
[1:31:33] the super sense is something that will
[1:31:34] make you believe god's word for that's
[1:31:37] the only thing it'll speak about
[1:31:40] it'll make you believe for things you
[1:31:41] can't see taste feel smell or hear
[1:31:43] because it'll take god's word and it
[1:31:46] will deliver that word to you and make
[1:31:48] you walk contrary to any other thing
[1:31:51] there is but god's word by faith he says
[1:31:54] faith does it amen so what the faith of
[1:31:57] god lines us up with the word of god and
[1:31:59] it makes us faithful what does faithful
[1:32:01] mean full of faith
[1:32:04] amen when you're when a person's
[1:32:05] faithful to something then what would we
[1:32:07] say if you are faithful at work what
[1:32:08] does it mean you show up every day you
[1:32:11] show on time you show up on time you put
[1:32:13] in a full day's effort
[1:32:15] and then you go home
[1:32:17] but every day if you show up and you do
[1:32:19] that they'd say that's a faithful
[1:32:20] employee
[1:32:21] so he's saying you're supposed to be
[1:32:22] faithful to the word of god full of
[1:32:24] faith you're supposed to be committed to
[1:32:26] the word of god you're supposed to be
[1:32:28] focused on the word of god
[1:32:30] and that's what shows your faithfulness
[1:32:32] shows that you're full of faith
[1:32:34] he says faith is a gift of itself
[1:32:39] how do i get a gift
[1:32:41] every gift we get from god is grace
[1:32:44] it starts with grace
[1:32:46] we'll get into it maybe a little bit
[1:32:47] later but faith is a gift of itself he
[1:32:49] says you may have a portion of it but
[1:32:51] there is a gift of faith just like some
[1:32:54] of you people anoint the sick and pray
[1:32:55] for them and you have a result that
[1:32:57] isn't a gift of healing he says that's a
[1:32:59] portion of faith there isn't a direct
[1:33:02] gift of healing for there's only one
[1:33:03] direct gift of healing there's only one
[1:33:05] direct gift of faith there's only one
[1:33:07] direct gift of miracles and so forth
[1:33:09] there was in the scriptures the apostles
[1:33:11] had it and they did mighty works philip
[1:33:13] and all of them but that was one gift of
[1:33:15] healing he's pointing to a single gift
[1:33:17] that does miracles that heals that
[1:33:19] delivers that does all of these things
[1:33:21] what is it
[1:33:22] he's pointing to one gift and that's
[1:33:24] acts 2 38 repent be baptized in the name
[1:33:27] of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:33:28] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:33:30] the
[1:33:30] gift amen of the holy spirit and as soon
[1:33:33] as they had that gift they did
[1:33:34] everything that jesus did
[1:33:36] he says there's only one gift and it's
[1:33:38] only the holy spirit there's only one
[1:33:40] gift of faith and it's the holy spirit
[1:33:42] there's only one gift of healing and
[1:33:43] it's the holy spirit so when he gives
[1:33:45] you the holy spirit he's given you faith
[1:33:47] he's giving you healing he's given you
[1:33:49] deliverance he's given you miracles he's
[1:33:51] given you every gift potentially that
[1:33:53] you could ever have need of what is it
[1:33:55] faith is the expression of the holy
[1:33:57] spirit in your life quickening the word
[1:33:59] to reality in you
[1:34:01] that's what faith is is the holy spirit
[1:34:03] working to quicken the word of god to
[1:34:05] you
[1:34:06] amen we read and we saw that the bride
[1:34:08] of jesus christ has the faith of jesus
[1:34:10] christ and what is that
[1:34:12] hebrews 16 13 this is the promise it
[1:34:15] says how bear when he the spirit of
[1:34:16] truth has come he will guide you into
[1:34:19] all truth for he shall not speak of
[1:34:20] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:34:24] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:34:26] things to come we've covered this before
[1:34:28] but i want to cover it again we read
[1:34:29] that part show you things to come and we
[1:34:31] think well he's talking about prophecy
[1:34:33] and future events and he is
[1:34:35] but that's not all there is to it
[1:34:37] because it's speaking of the expression
[1:34:39] of faith by the holy spirit bringing to
[1:34:41] reality the word of god in the life of
[1:34:43] the believer amen it's speaking of the
[1:34:46] point where we speak the word of god and
[1:34:48] it comes to pass
[1:34:51] because it says what whatever he hears
[1:34:53] he'll speak
[1:34:55] so you've got to hear the holy spirit
[1:34:56] and you've got to speak what the holy
[1:34:58] spirit says to you and he says in doing
[1:35:00] so he'll show you things to come now
[1:35:03] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[1:35:05] we speak because we have faith we speak
[1:35:08] because we have a revelation and then
[1:35:10] what is it what is the point of him
[1:35:12] telling us things to come if it never
[1:35:13] comes to pass
[1:35:16] that's only half of showing us things to
[1:35:18] come it's telling us it's coming the
[1:35:20] second half is that it comes
[1:35:22] that's the showing things that come part
[1:35:24] that we want that's what faith does is
[1:35:26] it doesn't just tell you it's coming but
[1:35:27] it holds you there and then it brings it
[1:35:29] amen what do we have we have revelation
[1:35:31] we have faith and then we have the event
[1:35:34] this event is as much showing us things
[1:35:36] to come as the revelation at the
[1:35:37] beginning it's revealing it to bring you
[1:35:39] to the place where it is revealed in
[1:35:41] reality not just in something that's in
[1:35:43] your head or in your heart and then it's
[1:35:45] a two-phase showing it's giving you
[1:35:47] faith to believe followed by receiving
[1:35:49] or seeing what you believed in in the
[1:35:51] first place amen like i said before your
[1:35:54] faith is insight into what god has come
[1:35:56] in your way
[1:35:57] if it's the faith of god then you've got
[1:35:59] a belief in it and that means it's
[1:36:00] coming your way
[1:36:02] brother brahm's in the prayer line here
[1:36:04] and he says lord jesus you said when he
[1:36:06] the holy ghost is come he'll show you
[1:36:08] things to come he says i pray you'll
[1:36:10] heal this woman as i your servant lay
[1:36:12] hands upon her in the name of your son
[1:36:14] jesus christ for her healing he says god
[1:36:16] bless you now go
[1:36:18] don't doubt have faith and believe with
[1:36:20] all your heart he's told her what her
[1:36:21] problem is
[1:36:23] and that was the sign that god was there
[1:36:26] and he says that's the holy spirit
[1:36:28] showing you
[1:36:29] what's going to happen that you're going
[1:36:30] to be healed then he prays and now he
[1:36:32] says no go get your healing
[1:36:34] the holy spirit has told you what's
[1:36:35] going to happen now go get it amen he
[1:36:38] says god has a provided way here tonight
[1:36:41] not through church not through theology
[1:36:43] but through the holy spirit will lead
[1:36:45] you to god's provided way of your
[1:36:47] sanctification the healing of your body
[1:36:50] the baptism of the holy spirit to joy
[1:36:53] peace and everything you have need of
[1:36:56] jesus christ is god's provided sacrifice
[1:36:58] and i say that he rose from the dead
[1:37:00] ascended on high sent back the holy
[1:37:02] ghost as god's provided way to lead the
[1:37:04] church he said he will not speak of
[1:37:07] himself but he'll testify of me
[1:37:09] jesus said and when he comes he'll bring
[1:37:11] these things to your memory and will
[1:37:13] show you things to come for the things
[1:37:14] that i do shall you do also the world
[1:37:17] won't see it but you'll see it i'll be
[1:37:19] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:37:21] age
[1:37:22] he says here at louisville my last
[1:37:24] message to you god's provided sacrifices
[1:37:27] jesus christ the resurrected one here
[1:37:30] empowering the church by the holy ghost
[1:37:33] this is the light
[1:37:36] walk ye in it find rest to your soul and
[1:37:39] healing of your diseases amen he says
[1:37:43] look the holy spirit when he has come he
[1:37:45] will lead and guide you into all truth
[1:37:47] and will show you things to come that's
[1:37:50] the sign of the church today
[1:37:52] watch where the holy spirits are moving
[1:37:55] where the holy spirit's moving you'll
[1:37:57] find love
[1:37:58] joy peace signs and wonders and the
[1:38:02] associated god the power of god amongst
[1:38:05] his people like this will be showing
[1:38:06] signs and wonders of the resurrection of
[1:38:08] jesus christ jesus said the things that
[1:38:10] i do shall you do also and greater than
[1:38:13] all this will you do for i go to my
[1:38:14] father and you'll see the things that
[1:38:17] jesus did will be accompanying that
[1:38:20] group of people amen the holy spirit's
[1:38:23] not just here to tell us what's coming
[1:38:25] he's there to bring it to a reality and
[1:38:26] that's when we really see it in our eyes
[1:38:29] with our five senses these different
[1:38:30] things amen he'll tell us of it
[1:38:33] we catch a revelation we believe it we
[1:38:36] act on it and then it happens amen we
[1:38:38] see it by faith
[1:38:40] and then we see it by sight
[1:38:42] because remember he says there's going
[1:38:43] to be a day where your faith becomes
[1:38:44] sight
[1:38:46] why because the holy spirit is leading
[1:38:47] you into it every single time
[1:38:50] now i just want to use a couple minutes
[1:38:51] here before we close i want to talk
[1:38:53] about the attributes of faith because
[1:38:54] we're preaching on what is faith
[1:38:57] so you've got to know what the
[1:38:58] attributes look like it'll help you know
[1:38:59] if you've got faith it'll help you know
[1:39:01] because it has a certain impact on your
[1:39:03] life
[1:39:04] amen we know it's a revelation of the
[1:39:05] will of god we know it can't disagree
[1:39:07] with the word of god we know that true
[1:39:09] faith will glorify god and not ourselves
[1:39:11] amen but we know there's more to it but
[1:39:13] if you don't get those three things
[1:39:14] right then the rest of it doesn't make
[1:39:16] any difference
[1:39:18] it's got to be in those three channels
[1:39:19] first brother brahm says we speak of
[1:39:21] faith we talk of faith but i wonder
[1:39:24] sometime if we know what we're talking
[1:39:26] about i wonder if if it isn't hope
[1:39:28] instead of faith why
[1:39:31] faith doesn't move no matter how
[1:39:33] contrary it looks faith stays right
[1:39:36] there
[1:39:36] it never
[1:39:38] moves amen faith is unwavering it stands
[1:39:40] solidly it holds fast it grips the
[1:39:42] promise and does not move it has eyes
[1:39:44] for only one thing and that's the word
[1:39:46] of god
[1:39:47] he says now some people can take the
[1:39:49] word and cut away enough to join the
[1:39:50] church that's about as far as they get
[1:39:53] others can cut in cut out every promise
[1:39:55] of god cut down the promise of the holy
[1:39:57] ghost cut out divine healing it depends
[1:39:59] on how strong that hand of faith that's
[1:40:01] holding that sword you notice he says
[1:40:02] they can take that sword of faith and
[1:40:04] cut out the promises of god
[1:40:06] what is it it's an anti-faith
[1:40:08] right it's it's an arm of unbelief is
[1:40:11] what he's talking about a sword of
[1:40:12] unbelief that'll take all those promises
[1:40:14] out and say it's not for me or it's not
[1:40:15] for this age
[1:40:17] he says every promise is yours it's
[1:40:19] sharp enough to cut everything that
[1:40:21] there is around you away and make you a
[1:40:23] son and a daughter of god free from all
[1:40:26] but it depends on what kind of a hand
[1:40:28] that's holding that source sword it must
[1:40:30] be a hand of faith
[1:40:32] he said this poor woman might have had
[1:40:34] many hindrances but our faith didn't
[1:40:36] have any he's talking about a woman that
[1:40:38] was healed he says no you may have a lot
[1:40:41] of hindrances
[1:40:43] can you say you have a lot of hindrances
[1:40:45] many times
[1:40:46] he says maybe your doctor says it can't
[1:40:50] happen
[1:40:51] maybe but if you've got faith it don't
[1:40:53] make any difference what anybody else
[1:40:55] says your faith doesn't have no
[1:40:57] hindrance your faith sees it it's the
[1:40:59] substance of things they've hoped for
[1:41:01] the evidence of things not seen abraham
[1:41:04] called the things which were not as
[1:41:05] though they were because god said so
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:08] that's an amazing thing
[1:41:10] because god said so he went 24 years and
[1:41:14] three months before he ever had any idea
[1:41:16] that it was going to come to pass amen
[1:41:19] amen faith is not mixed with anything
[1:41:21] else
[1:41:24] faith is a unity seed it has only one
[1:41:26] component and that's a revelation of the
[1:41:28] will of god that is in alignment with
[1:41:30] the will of god brother brown puts it
[1:41:32] this way he says now i've wondered often
[1:41:34] why he said mustard seed i might drop
[1:41:37] this thought mustard seed is the
[1:41:38] smallest among all seeds that's right
[1:41:41] but there isn't nothing we'll mix with
[1:41:43] mustard seed it's all mustard you can't
[1:41:46] mix it with kale or nothing to make it
[1:41:47] grow it's all mustard now he says if
[1:41:50] you've got that much faith
[1:41:52] all faith
[1:41:53] not mixed up with something else ask
[1:41:56] what you will it'll be given to you but
[1:41:58] it can't be wavering it's got to be
[1:42:00] genuine mustard seed if you know what
[1:42:02] i'm speaking of so faith is not hybrid
[1:42:04] is what he's saying you can't hybrid it
[1:42:06] with everything else let me put it this
[1:42:08] way faith is not a mixture of
[1:42:10] practicality and spirituality
[1:42:13] okay now let me explain that
[1:42:15] faith is not a mixture of practicality
[1:42:17] and spirituality because why it's a
[1:42:19] sovereign revelation of the will of god
[1:42:21] and that has nothing to do with
[1:42:22] practicality go look at abraham and see
[1:42:25] where the practicality was in that
[1:42:27] there was no practicality in that
[1:42:28] solution
[1:42:30] but it had to come by god but let me
[1:42:32] tell you this
[1:42:33] the answer
[1:42:35] may be a combination of practicality and
[1:42:37] spirituality let me explain that amen
[1:42:40] you take it at somebody that that has a
[1:42:42] gallbladder problem amen
[1:42:44] the problem the thing is that our faith
[1:42:46] is always in god
[1:42:48] so the way god answers is up to him
[1:42:50] that's his sovereignty that does it now
[1:42:52] god can heal gallbladder disease by a
[1:42:54] single spontaneous moment like he did
[1:42:56] for blanca
[1:42:58] or he can heal it by way of a surgery
[1:43:01] either way your faith is in god
[1:43:03] your faith is not in the doctor your
[1:43:05] faith is not in the preacher your faith
[1:43:07] is in god so if god uses medicine to
[1:43:09] heal you or god uses a sovereign act of
[1:43:12] a medical miracle to heal you that's up
[1:43:15] to god but your faith is in god you say
[1:43:17] my finances are in trouble so i'm going
[1:43:19] to believe god is going to fix my
[1:43:21] finances and then i'm going to get into
[1:43:24] what financial planning
[1:43:27] god might
[1:43:28] solve your problems with financial
[1:43:29] planning or he might just give you a
[1:43:32] promotion and you make more money and
[1:43:33] you don't have to do any promote any
[1:43:34] financial planning
[1:43:36] god chooses the way he's going to answer
[1:43:38] the answer can be practical the answer
[1:43:40] can be be emotional it can be all sorts
[1:43:43] of many things it's up to god to give
[1:43:44] the answer but your faith has to be in
[1:43:46] god and god alone and then a
[1:43:48] psychiatrist is not going to fix you
[1:43:50] god might use a psychiatrist but the
[1:43:52] psychiatrist is not where your face
[1:43:54] should be amen these different things we
[1:43:56] get into whether it's finances marriages
[1:43:57] relationships careers these different
[1:43:59] things it's not the method we have faith
[1:44:01] in it's the god that we have faith in
[1:44:03] and he chooses the method to bring the
[1:44:05] results amen so faith cannot be hybrid
[1:44:08] with your actions and god's sovereignty
[1:44:11] amen me plus god does not equal a good
[1:44:13] result
[1:44:14] god equals a good result amen god
[1:44:17] through faith in his word gives us the
[1:44:18] result that we want i can't add to them
[1:44:20] and i can't take away from them so why
[1:44:21] do i try and get myself involved in this
[1:44:23] situation
[1:44:25] why i just get tangled up in my own
[1:44:26] humanity i get in his way and i cause
[1:44:28] all sorts of problems amen look at the
[1:44:30] great answers to prayer in the faith and
[1:44:32] you'll see that most people just
[1:44:33] believed and acted and walked on
[1:44:36] they didn't get involved let me tell you
[1:44:37] about someone who got involved abraham
[1:44:39] and guess what we're still praying
[1:44:41] paying the price for abraham's
[1:44:42] involvement trying to bring the promise
[1:44:44] of god to pass in his life
[1:44:47] that said abraham had faith in the
[1:44:49] promise
[1:44:50] he believed he was going to get a child
[1:44:52] and guess what he believed enough to try
[1:44:54] and get involved sometimes we put him
[1:44:56] down because he got himself involved but
[1:44:57] he believed enough to try and get
[1:44:59] involved he believed that it was going
[1:45:00] to come one way or the other the problem
[1:45:01] was he thought it was going to come
[1:45:02] through him not through the working of
[1:45:04] god in his and sarah's life amen but he
[1:45:06] believed god enough to do it so faith
[1:45:08] has nothing to do with your capability
[1:45:10] and everything to do with god's power so
[1:45:12] don't try and add your power to god's
[1:45:14] amen that's really what we're talking
[1:45:15] about here it's him and him alone that's
[1:45:17] going to make these things happen
[1:45:20] last thing brother brahm says perfect
[1:45:22] faith is a master of all circumstances
[1:45:25] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[1:45:29] no matter what it is it masters it now
[1:45:31] you just watch when you believe anything
[1:45:33] do anything and you got faith in what
[1:45:34] you're doing no matter what the
[1:45:36] circumstance is that doesn't have one
[1:45:38] thing to do with it see it matters that
[1:45:40] circum it masters that circumstance if
[1:45:43] it's in a room of sickness and the
[1:45:44] lord's revealed that certain thing's
[1:45:46] going to happen you just speak it and go
[1:45:49] on
[1:45:50] show you things to come remember
[1:45:52] but the ron spencer tells a story how
[1:45:54] he's it's a saturday night and he's
[1:45:55] preparing for a sermon on sunday morning
[1:45:58] and there's a certain uh woman that's in
[1:46:00] the hospital and she's got her her
[1:46:01] kidneys are failing and they've given up
[1:46:04] all hope he says it was about 10 30
[1:46:07] in the evening he says and i was just
[1:46:08] praying he says i just kind of committed
[1:46:10] her to the lord he says and the holy
[1:46:11] spirit dropped down and he said go in
[1:46:14] pray over her and she will walk out of
[1:46:15] the hospital the next morning
[1:46:18] okay so he wasn't inclined to go pray
[1:46:20] for her he committed her to the lord and
[1:46:22] then he was going to go to sleep but the
[1:46:24] holy spirit said no you go in there and
[1:46:26] you tell her you pray over her and say
[1:46:28] you'll walk out of this hospital a well
[1:46:30] woman tomorrow morning
[1:46:32] he walked in he prayed for her he told
[1:46:34] her that she started rejoicing he walked
[1:46:36] out and a nurse grabbed him and said
[1:46:38] what do you think you're doing he said
[1:46:39] she's green
[1:46:41] she's got six to 12 hours to live at
[1:46:43] best he said she said she's dying and
[1:46:46] you just went and you told her he's
[1:46:48] gonna live she's gonna live he says i
[1:46:50] didn't say it he said it
[1:46:52] thus saith the lord and he walked out
[1:46:54] she walked out of that hospital the next
[1:46:56] morning a well woman
[1:46:57] why
[1:46:59] because he didn't dwell on what the
[1:47:00] sickness was he didn't dwell on what the
[1:47:01] symptoms were but he had the holy spirit
[1:47:03] telling him to go do it too he would not
[1:47:06] have presumed unless the holy spirit
[1:47:08] told him to do it but he said it was
[1:47:09] clear as day what he was supposed to do
[1:47:11] and he went and did it and so he could
[1:47:13] stand in a room of sickness in a room of
[1:47:15] death itself and say you'll walk out
[1:47:17] tomorrow well woman and she walked out
[1:47:19] the next morning completely healed of
[1:47:20] her kidney problems
[1:47:23] he says oh does it don't just ask any
[1:47:26] questions it's already over just keep
[1:47:28] going see it masters all circumstances
[1:47:30] well if you do this so and so is going
[1:47:32] to do
[1:47:33] that you see it's already got it
[1:47:35] mastered see faith believes that god
[1:47:37] will work it out i don't know how he's
[1:47:39] going to do it but he'll do it anyhow
[1:47:42] see it masters all circumstances and
[1:47:44] faith and love is in relation because
[1:47:46] you can't have faith unless you got love
[1:47:48] because your faith is in a god who is
[1:47:50] the very essence of love faith and love
[1:47:52] works together we read that earlier amen
[1:47:55] this is such a beautiful thought because
[1:47:57] it allows us a simple ruler for faith
[1:47:59] it doesn't ask questions it doesn't dig
[1:48:02] into the impossibility of it it doesn't
[1:48:04] apply logic or science to the situation
[1:48:06] but it simply believes brother branham
[1:48:07] said that god will work it out
[1:48:12] you don't have to wonder then
[1:48:13] you'll have to worry i was on a business
[1:48:15] call today and and we were supposed to
[1:48:17] have a bunch of us on the call and in
[1:48:18] the end only three of us did and one of
[1:48:20] them is a man that that basically
[1:48:22] believes that that our country is going
[1:48:24] to hell in a handbasket and he was
[1:48:26] saying he was cursing everything i've
[1:48:27] lost so much money and this and that and
[1:48:29] the other i'm not even making enough
[1:48:30] money to pay my bills and i don't even
[1:48:31] look at my investment statements anymore
[1:48:33] because i'm losing money hand over fist
[1:48:35] and he's going on and on and i said i
[1:48:36] said
[1:48:37] i won't say his name i said worry kills
[1:48:40] i said you're going to kill yourself you
[1:48:41] keep on going like this
[1:48:43] he's so caught up and he's so worried
[1:48:45] about what's going on and the market's
[1:48:47] dropping in the direction the country's
[1:48:48] going in this cancel culture and woke
[1:48:51] this and blah blah blah and he's
[1:48:53] practically killing himself because he's
[1:48:55] worried about it
[1:48:57] i don't care
[1:48:59] i don't really look at my investment
[1:49:00] statements because i'm trusting i won't
[1:49:02] ever need them
[1:49:05] of course we've got a few people here
[1:49:06] that probably thought the same thing so
[1:49:08] i'll keep planting the potatoes but in
[1:49:10] the end i'm not looking to my
[1:49:11] investments to keep me going through i'm
[1:49:12] looking to the one who provides every
[1:49:14] day to keep me going through it man i
[1:49:16] can't worrying doesn't add to the
[1:49:18] situation it doesn't help me in any way
[1:49:20] all it does is make me sicker brother
[1:49:22] brown how often he'd say you have a
[1:49:23] nervous problem i was listening to a
[1:49:25] serious day says how many people have
[1:49:26] nervous trouble and almost every hand in
[1:49:28] the building went up
[1:49:29] why we get sick half the time is because
[1:49:31] we're nervous
[1:49:32] we're worrying we're not looking to the
[1:49:34] promise we're looking to the situation
[1:49:36] we're looking to the circumstances we're
[1:49:37] looking to the symptoms
[1:49:39] brother bram says this and this is our
[1:49:41] closing our closing quote he says it's
[1:49:43] just the simplicity of it it's he's
[1:49:45] talking about faith now faith is the
[1:49:47] substance he says it's nothing you can
[1:49:49] work yourself up to
[1:49:51] so don't work yourself up
[1:49:54] it's no excitement i notice people come
[1:49:57] in the line just get to shaking
[1:49:58] themselves and saying oh god hallelujah
[1:50:00] amen glory to god he says don't do that
[1:50:03] you interfere with faith there you
[1:50:05] interfere with god come up reverently
[1:50:08] just lay your hand up and believe that's
[1:50:10] all
[1:50:11] faith you don't work up yourself up to
[1:50:14] it he says faith is something that's
[1:50:16] already in your heart you just come and
[1:50:19] believe you see what i mean
[1:50:22] amen even on the flip side i'm reminded
[1:50:24] i marvel when i listen to a message
[1:50:27] service and and brother brahm's going
[1:50:29] and at the end he's going through the
[1:50:30] prayer line
[1:50:32] and does he yell to get those demons or
[1:50:34] sicknesses off of people
[1:50:37] is he scream and shout does he pound the
[1:50:39] ground
[1:50:41] does he run around
[1:50:43] no
[1:50:44] what does he do he lays his hand on them
[1:50:45] and he says
[1:50:47] satan in the name of jesus christ
[1:50:50] come out of my brother come out of my
[1:50:52] sister and he says god bless you brother
[1:50:54] you're healed god says god bless you
[1:50:56] your sister you're healed but it wasn't
[1:50:58] some big show
[1:51:00] brother brown says we need to get away
[1:51:01] from this hollywood evangelism
[1:51:05] he just said you just do it there's a
[1:51:07] quote i'll bring later where he says
[1:51:08] faith doesn't try faith just does
[1:51:10] that's what he's talking about he says
[1:51:12] you've already got it you're coming up
[1:51:13] and you're just expressing what you
[1:51:14] already have you don't come up to get
[1:51:16] faith you come up because you have faith
[1:51:18] and all you're doing is in obedience to
[1:51:19] the word where it says if
[1:51:21] if you if you have any sick among you
[1:51:22] come up and the
[1:51:24] the elders will lay hands on them and
[1:51:25] the prayer of faith shall save them
[1:51:27] right all you're doing is coming simply
[1:51:29] and saying i believe enough to come up
[1:51:31] and act on it
[1:51:32] and that's how you know you've got faith
[1:51:33] as if you'll act on it we'll get into
[1:51:35] that in the next service lord willing
[1:51:36] amen but i hope this gives you some
[1:51:38] clarity on what faith is
[1:51:40] amen that it's not just about working
[1:51:41] yourself up into it or you're trying to
[1:51:43] add something to you or you're trying to
[1:51:45] do this or that or other but it's simply
[1:51:47] taking what god has given you and let it
[1:51:49] letting it have an effect in your life
[1:51:51] that's all it is it's simple so all you
[1:51:52] need to do is get the hindrances away
[1:51:54] and that faith will automatically rise
[1:51:56] up i i've got a quote
[1:51:57] in my notes for the next service
[1:52:00] what brother brahm says you can't
[1:52:02] you do that he says you can't even stop
[1:52:04] it from coming forth
[1:52:05] it'll just come out
[1:52:07] because there's no hindrance there so
[1:52:09] that's all we're looking to do amen god
[1:52:10] bless you let's just stand here
[1:52:12] the question after this is we know what
[1:52:14] faith is so it's how do you get faith
[1:52:16] how do you get your faith to have a
[1:52:17] greater effect how do you get it to grow
[1:52:19] in your life and that's what we'll talk
[1:52:20] a little bit about on sunday amen lord
[1:52:22] willing amen
[1:52:25] amen let's just bow our heads
[1:52:30] heavenly father
[1:52:32] lord it's a simple sermon a simple
[1:52:34] service tonight heavenly father
[1:52:37] lord i think that's the way we need it
[1:52:38] so many times is we just need to see it
[1:52:40] in simple clarity
[1:52:42] of what you've given us lord what you've
[1:52:44] offered to us and all we have to do is
[1:52:46] accept it lord and move with it and then
[1:52:48] just sit back and watch your work
[1:52:50] heavenly father and lord i pray as we
[1:52:52] move through this little series on faith
[1:52:54] lord that we would just simply accept it
[1:52:56] in our hearts lord that your holy spirit
[1:52:58] will quicken it in our lives lord that
[1:53:00] we move aside every sin lord every
[1:53:02] thought of unbelief lord every skeptical
[1:53:04] attitude that we might have lord and we
[1:53:06] just trust your word and move on in
[1:53:08] faith expecting you to bring it to pass
[1:53:10] in our lives
[1:53:11] lord we pray you just lift up the hearts
[1:53:13] of your people this evening lord that
[1:53:14] you would encourage them lord i know we
[1:53:16] have many needs here in many different
[1:53:18] areas of our lives lord you see the
[1:53:20] secret desires of each heart lord you
[1:53:22] see that the prayers that they've laid
[1:53:24] before you lord the requests lord where
[1:53:26] they've just stood on your word in their
[1:53:28] trusting lord i pray that you would
[1:53:30] water that faith lord that it would just
[1:53:32] rise up within the lord and that it will
[1:53:33] bring forth the fruit of your word
[1:53:35] through the holy spirit in our lives we
