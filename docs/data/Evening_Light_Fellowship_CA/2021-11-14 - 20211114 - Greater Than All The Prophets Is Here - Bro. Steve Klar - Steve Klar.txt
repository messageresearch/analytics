sisters brother we got to look beyond the human amen we got to look beyond the natural to see the spiritual amen look beyond the natural brothers and sisters to see god and believe that god's with that brother god's with that sister god is in that brother god's in that sister and he's blessing their testimony amen and to believe by the grace of god that we're here because it's christ in us the

faith it takes him in christ in us the hope of glory so god bless us amen and we have a something special again this morning before the going forth of the word and it's the dedication of it of a baby and i think i've dedicated most of the children here and even as i said i came and i blessed mom and dad and then i dedicated their children and i blessed some of their marriages amen and dedicated their their grandchildren amen this is amazing surely that's hard to believe i've been here that long amen that i that i'm going beyond the on the the position of a uh oh just a brother in the lord and a son you know to a husband to an oh yeah to a father grandfather amen this is absolutely amazing so to god be the glory amen so we want to share with you a scripture and you can turn with me to st luke's gospel chapter two amen before we move into the dedication of uh the son of our brother joseph and sister priscilla amen god is it must be grace this is their fifth child fourth child oh well we trust grace is there amen amen if there's a maybe it was a daughter we call her grace amen but it's a son and they want to name him rafael david edward coffey amen well they believe in three names amen so our sister sister priscilla meant to was singing about the three amen so we pray the grace of god to bless them and to bless the child as we get into the dedication amen so in the book of luke chapter 2 and beginning to read at verse 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days well what about our brother rayfeld david ebert coffee well god knew before the foundation of the world amen even though brother joseph maybe such a brazilian no we didn't know god knew yes amen and yet there still may be other children that we don't know but god knows yes amen and god's waiting on this one waiting on that one that's a problem god mentioned when he was preaching in florida concerning the end of everything and the coming of the lord always said maybe he said well this coming to receive christ and be borned again and he said maybe that young girl somewhere in in a church or somewhere she came to receive the lord was born again and he said maybe he said that's that's that's the next is the coming of the lord maybe he was waiting on her he said and now oh now let's look for his coming well maybe he was waiting on on rayfell amen praise the lord oh yes every predestinated seed amen he's waiting on this one waiting on that one so brother oh we thought maybe he was waiting on me waiting on you william another son or a daughter lady on a wife or a husband oh but no it keeps on going so we're looking for that last one to come into the world by the grace of god amen and truly well brother god has done sufficient right now to to do what to get us to look up yeah and not there was no other ministry out of our lord jesus christ all down through the church ages they just preached and pointed to christ preached and pointed to christ but till finally in the last days christ himself came down amen praise the lord in the ministry of malachi 4 and through the ministry he was declaring look up praise the lord why because our redemption draws now praise the lord he came down 2 000 years ago to redeem us spiritually amen and what he worked at in now he's working it out amen physically now when we're looking for the redemption of our bodies amen to receive a glorious body like onto his glorious body his glorified body amen mother that we won't experience death no more no sickness no old age amen it's going to be tremendous on the other side well the problem of god's if you're ministering here under the true anointing you'll be there so as i said you'll have to deal with me there if you you deal with me here amen so you have to deal with me there but to god be the glory because i won't be 73 years old amen and we won't have no gray hair amen to god be the glory amen let's believe with all of our hearts amen and brother he's ordained this and this child this child this child to keep us mindful amen that we mature to a certain age and that's it that's right there's no infant of days and there's no old man that has not fulfilled his days thank god amen so we're looking for it tremendously the blessed hope amen to get out of time into eternity get out of this nature into the heavenly nature amen by the power of the holy ghost amen so god be with us as we go into the dedication of this child amen listen oh well when there'll be another one there'll be another one well again we just wait and see maybe maybe uh rafael maybe this is going to be the last next could be the coming of the lord the next could be the resurrection next could be the rapture look up because our redemption draweth not brother look up because our redemption is here you could save back 2000 years ago oh look look here why else he said i am the resurrection of the light he was our redemption he was going to lay down his life and pick it up again amen well that's what the disciples didn't understand well they're going to kill you no stay away from jerusalem well brother we as he died we die as he laid down his life and picked it up again to a glorified body we're going to lay down our lives amen believing for a glorified body like his glorious body praise the name of the lord oh brother what faith do you have brother got to go beyond the faith oh god sent a prophet god did this and the seals were open and this was open that yes but why did god do that and is it the purpose that he had is he accomplishing that in you amen is he accomplishing that in me oh god had a reason for it yes oh well it was just prophecy being fulfilled god said he would do this he would do that yes but it was ordained to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen the prophets highlighted that to us and he got to the place where he just left it and he said i'm going to move on you know and just not long after that god called the prophet home amen why because god had already through the ministry had done what he wanted to do and what we needed to give us the faith in this hour amen our brother highlighted it again concerning it went into total darkness but the proud of god did put that little bit of light there before to represent the bright age amen that's the truth because there's going to be a generation not very many but it's going to be a generation that's good that's ordained predestinated in this hour to receive the word and receive the faith that's in the word which is resurrection and rapture amen the faith that all the others end they just moved on moved on moved on moved on moved on until we're coming into the faith of divine love divine not just love divine love and as our brother was bringing out concerning love in the ministry remember again there's there's a filio love and there's an agape law there's a human law but there's a divine love amen so brother i trust we got the anointing and the baptism of divine love by the grace of god oh you can be kind you can be nice you can be this but brother you've got to have more than that like jesus brother what caused jesus to lay down his life amen divine love praise the lord and that's why he was challenging peter love us thou me more than these and brother he said that he said this he said this he said this and he and he and he referenced the human law and that's what he's used but then he referenced divine love amen he was challenging peter's faith amen because peter was right there of all the other disciples we as i said it was we don't there was none that jesus had any trouble with any problems with just peter because peter was constantly challenging his faith what he did what he did and peter was saying no don't do this don't do that don't go to jerusalem they'll kill you and so on but he jesus knew by faith he had to he laid on his life for peter amen so when he come back peter loves the me amen brother do we love him not with human love but with divine love amen and brother to think that of all the other disciples that he had more problems with peter yet peter was ordained peter was predestinated the messenger on the day of pentecost amen to god be the glory hallelujah thank god amen i better stop i'll be preaching and brother steve be preaching amen so god help us thank god for the ministry of the word all so powerful with our brother steve amen pray the grace of god be with him as he goes forth again this morning but in the dedication of our brother joseph and sister priscilla's son let's read again luke chapter 2 and verse 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law moses were accomplished they brought unto them to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ amen and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took e.m up in his arms and blessed god amen and said lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to the word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles amen and the glory of thy people israel amen and in this hour god what god is doing is to encourage us into the resurrection and rapture and believing that our brother joseph sister priscilla's son will not be left out amen but but for a reason he was we've been ordained predestinated to be here until he came on the scene and as i said maybe there's another one coming somewhere whose name as our brother referenced again last night in the word whose name was on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world just think you didn't know his name but no nobody knew those names until they were manifested in the flesh oh yeah and was god god anointed them just to to do this the name of that to name it that the name of that oh yeah pray grace that we're following the leadership of god today amen brother in the natural they gave us this name and that name but in the spiritual trust we we have received the name of our lord jesus christ amen we are sons and daughters of god amen let's stay stand and let's sing i love him because he first loved me purchased my salvation on calvary's tree and we'll ask our brother joseph sister priscilla and our brother rafael to come amen and also yes and we and i'll ask the parents to come as well and stand with them amen [Music] just my selfie [Music] on cow preached [Music] i [Music] love him i love him because he first love me salvation [Applause] [Music] i love him amen [Music] he first love me and [Applause] virtus might [Applause] [Music] as we sing it again i'm going to ask our brother jonathan if you would come and stand with me here amen and i read the scriptures so maybe we'll i'll receive the child maybe pass to our brother john ask him the blessed amen so we thank the lord for our brother's presence amen to god be the glory maybe this is the first time that he he dedicated he would dedicate a child a man and uh not long after they arrived here i dedicated his his young one the youngest one amen so the lord bless us amen and please oh please let's have faith and so i'm sure the lord is so pleased with the young people in this assembly oh yes most definitely you're there to worship you're there to praise god you're there to sing amen i pray grace that that relationship will continue amen and you'll mature and mature into sons and daughters of god amen so let's let's believe and pray the grace of god yes to our brother joseph sister priscilla is believe and pray the grace of god to the child amen as we committed into the hands of the lord and believe and pray amen that what that god is going to bless our brother joseph bless sister priscilla with the wisdom they need the leadership they need the anointing they need to truly amen and do it for the glory of god amen says what we'll do is thank god for the child bless the child amen and commit it into the hands of the lord and pray the grace of god to mom and dad amen because if there's ever an hour that you need the lord to help you it's this hour amen because this is the hour wherein the bible tells us concerning what's going on and the love of many shall wax cold deceiving being deceived and and even children that says won't want respect their parents that's right that's spoken of right here concerning the last days so brother sister we pray the grace of god amen for the anointing to continue with our brother amen rafael david edwards coffee amen by the grace of god you'll be trained in the right way amen and he will he will see that way he will see that life reflected in his mother and father he will see that way in life reflected in yes grandparents and our brothers and sisters in christ for the glory of god amen let's plead the token life of the blood for the grace of god amen let's sing it again and our brother johnson will come i love him i love him love him because he first love me we're just my salvation amen amen yes he's purchased our salvation but he's also purchased our brother rafael's salvation amen to god be the glory amen praise the lord amen thank you brother amen the lord's got one of them to give us sometimes amen that's right that's the truth because he could maybe we're going to make trouble so if you calm us down you'll do that amen so remember the natural types the spiritual lord amen to god be the glory let's have respect unto the lord let's sing it again and we'll turn to our brother jonathan [Music] and he purchased our redemption amen [Music] amen amen god bless your brother thank you amen amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord what a special moment it is yes lord to take a child from

spirit of christ is doing in you folks here is amazing amen so keep up the battle amen we've been treated so kind and and fed so graciously amen i'm not going to lose one pound by being here praise the lord amen without further ado let's go to the scripture that's what we've come for i want to hear what god has to say and i hope that you just relax a little bit in his presence this morning as we praise the lord by his word amen let's turn to matthew's gospel matthew chapter 12 and we're going to read verse 38 amen i i was praying that the lord would give us something for the meetings here and i i preached this of course at home before i came because i wanted to be sure that i could dot all the eyes and cross all the teeth and i believe it was a blessing at home but really i in my heart i believe that the lord has had this for this service and so i trust that you'll pull that way knowing that it's for us today matthew chapter 12 and we're going to start at verse 38. then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for as jonas was three days and three nights in in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the lord blessed the reading of his word we can have our seats this morning uh before i start i just want to just give a little illustration and and just kind of relax and and you know there was a king one time uh a king one time who uh had uh desired to to do something for his his people his the people of his land and so you know he uh he he made a big great feast and he invited those to come that were his subjects to come and be part of the great feast but one of the conditions to come and be part of the great feast was they had to bring a vessel some sort of vessel and and they had to fill it with water for the king in his in his uh around his his courtyard his palace he had a had dug a moat and he needed the the moat to be filled with water and so he uh he invited his subjects to come and he said bring a vessel and fill it with water and when you come to the to the gate i want you to take that vessel that's filled with water and i want you to pour it out into the moat and then you're welcome to come in and we're going to have a feast together and you know i kind of thought about this illustration because we were over brother joe uh fellowship with you and you had that great big mug you know how how many seen that great big mug well you know something we all got little glasses like this but brother brother joe he pulled he pulled up this great big mug and filled it you know i think you filled it with ice or something similar and and i filled the juice and he offered well anybody wants something big but he had this great big this big and you know he told me it was you know it was dangerous for driving because we put it up to drink he couldn't see anyhow it's reminding me of this this illustration that i want to share with you this morning and so everybody came to the to the feast and you know some of them uh they came with a glass such as this some others came with a with a you know a smaller little bucket others had great big barrels one fella in fact he he was so inspired he he got his his carriage he was pulled with horses and he put he put a great big barrel on it and he filled it full of water he was enthusiastic and he came to the to the king's gate and he poured it in there and he went and had a feast and everybody was feasting together and at the end of the feast the king got up and he said subjects of the land people my people he says i've asked you today to bring a vessel i've asked you to bring any type of vessel and you could choose whatever you want and i you had a job to do all you need to do is bring some water bring some effort bring something to the kingdom and pour it into my moat he says today i have something for you because of your sacrifice and whatever sacrifice that you had according to your sacrifice you shall receive and at the time he instructed his p his his great men to open the great doors that were sitting before him inside of those that great area this a big banquet area was filled with all kinds of jewels and all kinds of tapestries all can you imagine that the king has had and now he said to his subjects whatever vessel you brought you can fill and i looked at that story today and i thought to myself the lord has called us to bring a sacrifice of praise to him and whatever we have given out the lord has promised to refill so i'm saying today if you've just brought a little shot glass that's all you're going to get but if you bring that vessel that was on that cart let me tell you you get like the prophet of god said you get exactly what you expect and so this morning well which is now afternoon we are going to come with our large vessels okay we're going to come with a brother joe sized glass all right and we are going to drink of what god has for us because i believe god has in store amazing things today we read in our scriptures in our in our beginnings of our scriptures and the scribes and the pharisees were asking and they wanted to see a sign now i want you to notice that that that israel was used to seeing a sign they were used to seeing the glories of god they they had moses and they they seen the great signs that happened in egypt and they were they were told about them so asking for sign or seeing signs and miracles and wonders wasn't an odd thing so for them to say jesus we want to see a sign was not a strange thing for them to ask but jesus he speaks and he says you know something the only sign that you're going to see is the sign of the prophet jonas and we understand that that sign of that three days and three nights in the in the belly of the whale and the reflection of the three days and nights of our lord jesus was death burial and resurrection and so i want you to notice today that that the sign that is given to you and i is speaking of the resurrection of our lord jesus christ we we are looking for the coming of the lord how many this morning is looking for the coming of the lord well friends if there's going to be a coming of the lord there's going to be have to be a quickening of our lives there's going to be having a change of our bodies there's going to have something in this natural being has got to change you know when abraham and sarah they were promised a child amen they were promised a child to come and and and friends they looked forward just like we are they looked forward to the promise of god but one day friends their body began to change one day their body became in a position where sarah could receive life and express that life and one day friends there's going to be a time though we've talked about it and we've rehearsed about it there's going to be a day an actual day when the coming of the lord is upon us and are we going to be ready brother branham says in this message it is the rising of the sun he said that's what easter proved he was not only the word but he was god himself the dynamics of the word now brother branham continues speaking on the dynamics he says that's made the body of jesus christ was cold and stiff and dead in the grave shaking to life and raise again and roll away the stone he said i am he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead how many remembers in the scripture the sun said he was dead the moon said that he was dead the stars said that he was dead all nature said that he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize hallelujah that he is alive again one day friends every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ the whole world must confess that he is alive he was not only the mechanics god's word he was the dynamics to prove it hallelujah in the message elijah brother began running against the same let me tell you something right now if jesus christ raised from the dead he is living in his church hallelujah he's living in his church today and we are his representatives this morning oh that should bring us right out of our sheets to recognize that we are the representatives of jesus christ we are the ambassadors of jesus christ when we go to our workplaces people see jesus christ inside of us hallelujah brother branham begins to say again if jesus is here look in the meetings he's pointing to the meetings around him come to the campaigns once when the anointing of the holy ghost comes if it doesn't produce the very same life of jesus christ healing knowledge foretelling saying what will what will not watch if it's not true it was jesus isn't dead now i look at the very meanings that we've been part of right now and i believe not knowing a situation at all here at the church but i do believe in my heart when we speak the word of god god begins to discern our hearts god begins to do something there's questions something we wonder about situations in our families even situations in the church and god begins to foretell he begins to tell us of his will he begins to tell us watch and see and know that i am a god that's full and alive and full of dynamic full of power i mean my word and i have quickening life inside my word hallelujah this morning watch if it isn't true what is it it's jesus isn't dead he rose from the dead he said a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me [Music] glory be to god for i will be with you even in you to the end of the world and i love those worlds where it's not just with you but i will be in you hallelujah in our text reading this morning in verse 42 we've continued to read and it says the queen of the south shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she come from the utmost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold i'm greater than solomon is here and then i hear the voice of the prophet speak to us in this message greater than solomon is here he says to us behold a greater than all the prophets greater than all the prophets is here because we have heard the wisdom of solomon now i want you to know us when we see we hear that those words the wisdom of solomon who gave solomon the wisdom solomon was but a boy and he was growing and he said i can't lead these people lord i can't do this by myself lord would you give me some help when the lord said yes i'll give you what would you like and he said i would like to have wisdom he didn't say i'd like to have a new chariot i'd like to have more gold i'd like to be successful he said lord i would like to have your wisdom and i believe hearing the word of god understanding by the supernatural this morning is the wisdom of god to us if you have a need this morning say lord i'd like to have your wisdom i'd like to have your knowledge i'd like to have something this morning that's from you oh that's greater that's greater than all the prophets i desire to have you lord the wisdom of god and the leaders say in church age brother adam says says now notice again how jesus overcame the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians it was in his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak i want you to notice he applied wisdom he applied his own word when satan was tempting there what did jesus do he said it is written oh you can have bread no it is written you can have all the kingdoms of the world no it is written and when satan comes against his friends this morning we need to use the wisdom of the word we need to use the wisdom that god has given and apply the word and say to satan it is written oh you've stolen my health but didn't give it back because the word of god says it is written by your stripes this morning can you raise a hand if you're sick if you're sick this morning receive it in the name of the lord by your stripes the wisdom of god i am healed apply the word in our hearts this morning hallelujah thank you lord in the message of god brother branham says you had better stay with the word the word will lead you across because the word is christ and christ is god and god is the holy ghost we need to stay with the wisdom of the word and questions and answers on genesis he says now no one has seen god and now the next thing uh be in the beginning c by natural eyes we've got to look this by not natural but supernatural eyes he says looking we see a little white light i remember brother phantom talking about this we see a little white light formula there how do we see this by supernatural eyes natural eyes cannot see this many before us heard these words and speak this on logos again they heard about it but they could not see it because they did not have the supernatural eyesight to see the wisdom of god brother branham brings it forth he says now by eyes of the supernatural looking we see a little white light forming up there what is it that was called by the bible reader's logos or anointing or the anointing he that was the word of god came forth and showed himself even in this generation it was the word of god can you hear the wisdom of god for behold friends greater than all the prophets is here now i just want to i don't want to just limit it there to 1965 when now brother branham had left to see no it's right here today i want you to claim it by faith behold greater than all the prophets is right here in this tabernacle this morning the holy spirit was here through the singing of the songs the holy spirit was even in here pointing us in a a during a baby dedication to the coming of the lord you know friends you know you think oh it's a baby dedication but friends the lord is near and we pray that raphael be that last seed hallelujah if we can't find them out there let's bring that last seed and have them come forth about our wombs and our beings today oh greater than all the prophets is here this morning i want you to notice here in our text and that it expresses it says behold behold that word behold now that word of behold and you can look at the dictionary or and you could see that and it gives the impression of see behold see or it gives another uh impression of a witness somebody that has beheld behold and i want to speak to you behold as a witness have you seen the logos of god in your midst behold as a witness has you seen the word of god the thoughts of god be manifested right here in your midst before for god is here god is right before us in our midst and i see it as we spoke at this yes last night you are the thoughts of god you are the testimony of god so i could say this morning can i get a witness oh you can do better than that this morning if i've got to do all the preaching you're going to do all the pulling do i have the witness this morning hallelujah we are witnesses now let me go to the new testament for just a moment to get the witness of the glory of god i look at john and john says it lovely he says now the word was made flesh and it dwelt among us oh and i like these words and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth he was amongst them they tangibly held them held him he seen the signs and the wonders he heard them speak gracious words the beatitude on the mount he fed the five thousand he crossed the sea and went to a man called legion they seen they witnessed the glory of god and in john chapter 21 in verse 25 he says and there are also many other things which jesus did and which if we could we should be written every one of them i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written he's telling us here i can't write everything jesus did it's impossible to do right down the worlds the world could not contain the volumes of what jesus did now this was a witness of his first coming that we itself the world would see the glory of god and the books the volumes could not contain the world could not tame contain what jesus did but i want you to notice that there was a witness of his second coming oh he's come the spirit of god has come oh as we said he's come but he's coming but in 63 we have seen god's coming and anointing of god coming and speaking to a people so can i get another witness and i say it from the prophet's message that he was a witness and he said in the message of token he said just what i've i've seen in my own ministry oh now let's get to it oh let me see what i've seen in my own ministry seen him done you couldn't pile the volumes on the platform here if i wrote it in detail what i've seen him do in my own ministry seen him do it he had more success in my ministry than he did of his own now can you imagine john said the world could not contain what jesus himself when he was manifest in a flesh here on earth dead can you imagine now brother branham is saying that he did more in brother branham's ministry than he did in his own come on oh now this was elijah ministry but i want you to point to yourself and see what the elite shout ministry was all about friends brother branham begins to say now remember now the more success now not me he had glory hallelujah he had more success in jeffersonville than he did in nazareth can you imagine why because greater greater than all the prophets greater than all the prophets is here oh when it came his first coming john chapter one says he came to his own and his own received him not now that is a sad picture oh hallelujah the word was made flesh they were looking for him but they could not receive him and so i thought my heart lord why is it they could not receive him you know the nation that he was born to he could not receive them why was it lord and i believe it's for the same reason that people cannot receive him today you say brother steve what is it i believe the crux of the matter is he came too simple that's right amen come on lord jesus came to simple he was born in a manger they were looking for a palace they were looking for something tremendous to happen they first were looking for john the baptist or or that elisha spirit to come back on a chariot he didn't come that way he came through a man that wore a camel's skin and he yelled and screamed and said repent and they weren't looking for that they were looking for something spectacular but jesus works in simplicity i want you to notice before the seals were broke what message did brother bradley preach god in simplicity we can't you know god doesn't want us to make things so difficult remember to god we are like an ant okay and and we think we're awfully smart sometimes we think we got it all figured out because we got an iphone oh hallelujah i got a i got an ipad or i got a tablet i i got some technology now we're just amazingly smart friends we've tapped into god's laboratory but god is more vast than that and friends we got to look at god in simplicity we got to come to a place where we humble ourselves and the people of jesus day they could not humble themselves because he didn't come to the mainstream now think of it for a moment nazareth where's nazareth man where is nazareth well you know i i think about myself is could any good thing come up saint john newfoundland honestly in a pile of rocks someplace don't you think god would be in toronto skyscrapers or ottawa or somebody amazing and i'm sure he's there too in the churches there don't get me wrong but let me say friends this morning you know when we think of where god could be people are not looking in a little building like this they're looking at large buildings on on the on the hill someplace that's got tapestries and gold and silver and they've got men that are stabbing just right not spitting everywhere they just got men that are just doing the sacraments and going forth that's where god should be but god chose simply to be amongst the people brother branham says god will hide himself in something so simple that will cause the wise to miss it a million miles and then turn right back around in that some little simple thing in some simplicity of his way of his working and reveal himself right out again something when i became a believer i shouted because you know something i i i'm not a great big theologian i'm just a simple guy that loves god and when he sees showed me that it comes simplicity as babes suffer the children to come unto me for such this friends come unto me he called us that those are willing to be simple and humble to come unto him and to receive of him brother branham then says a man is always giving god praise for what he what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignore what he's doing i want to challenge you what is god doing right now in your life my jesus he's done so many good things for us he's revealed himself in so many ways oh brother steve i'm lacking yes we're lacking but he's giving us more oh bring your vessel friends oh no just bring a shot guys bring a great big barrel bring it to him say lord i'm simple i'm humble fill it up lord fill my cup and make me whole this morning amen oh brother branham says they look forward and seeing the great coming that's a a great thing coming and going to happen and 9 times out of 10 it's already happened right around them it's happening right here around you angels of god are here this morning amen they're driving back the spirits of the enemy so that we can see clearly the glory of the lord for greater this morning right in our midst greater this morning is that one that's greater than all the prophets he's here this morning it's already happening god working and moving right now if we can only see not by our natural eyes but lord i pray this morning in the name of jesus christ that we conceived by spiritual eyes this morning your glory that we could see by faith right in this moment praise the lord right here right here this morning we can see the moving of god in our midst and in our hearts so i want to encourage you this morning hallelujah to open your heart i wonder if you just close your eyes just for a moment oh this is interactive preaching but friends close your eyes this morning and say to the lord lord open my heart open the eyes of my heart lord that i might see your glory who for greater than all the prophets is here this morning hallelujah now that word faith the brother branham talks about faith he said faith is the key that unlocks the door and we heard by our pastor this morning faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god so if you want to have your faith increase for whatever it is in the knowledge of knowing that god is here with you you need to hear the word of god for faith is that key that will unlock the door and jesus said i am the dar you want to unlock christ in your life use the key of faith and it's by revelation by divine or supernatural disclosure to us the simplicity of god it's by the divine supernatural simplicity of god now if we look back in our text we see you know the jews as that time they were instructed by the scriptures they were well read by the scriptures paul himself was was trained under the feet of gamalia they knew the word the scribes the pharisees see they dealt in the word and the people went to the synagogue regularly to hear the readings of the scrolls so they were well trained to know the kind of character that was going to be in the messiah and one of the major scriptures that they honed down to they looked to and it said by moses in in deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 15 moses declaring what the the prophet or the messiah would be like and he said the lord god will raise up unto thee a prophet so they were looking for a prophet from the midst of them right amongst their people they weren't looking outside they were looking right for them amongst them and and he would be of their brethren like unto moses now they've seen signs and they've seen wonders out of what god had done in moses ministry so the people were looking for a prophet and they were looking for a prophet likely to moses there was they wanted to see signs out of out of jesus because maybe if they saw a sign they could start believing but it's not in the sign it's not in the wonders it's by the word that was brought you know as time progressed these words of prophecy we're in the minds of the people but not on the forefront of the people's minds and you say how does that work brother steve well i want to point back to noah for just a moment noah god asked him i want you to build this ark i want you to get it ready now the first few days and months and even years that moa moses noah would get up and he began to preach it's going to rain the people hearkened his words they listened to his words but as time progressed and you know distractions of life progress what happened their faith began to wane in what god really said now was it in their minds yes it was in the back part of their minds now i want you before fast forward to this what moses said about about a prophet they were looking for a prophet they desired to have the prophet but friends the preaching of the word according to hey there's going to be a prophet there's going to be there's going to be became dim in their ears it became common language oh they know the where the when the how they had it all together they could sit together they've heard it for a long time just like we have heard the message of the hour today but there is going to be a rapture all of what the prophet has preached to us and and share it to us and open the mystery so that we could believe friends the last episode the last thing to happen is that there's a change of our bodies hey there's nothing else to be fulfilled i trust that you believe that here this morning hallelujah there's only seven messengers in the hand of god and we've been led by that messenger and friends the scripture said in joshua times oh my servant moses is dead but the holy spirit joshua will lead you over we are led by the word of god this morning in the ministry of elisha the bride having a ministry we're not looking for another man to come we're not looking for another grouping of a man to give us the holy ghost christ himself greater then all the prophets is already here this morning and he's in our midst this morning so friends i want you to notice now that the time of israel you know before jesus came it was 400 years from malachi to jesus 400 years now you think 400 years well okay let me ask you a question to all those that are are are brilliant this morning who remembers that would happen in 19 or 16 21. i don't hear anybody what anybody knows 1721 1821 how about 1921. that's a long time ago friends right what happened there so when you think of 400 years that's a super super long time from malachi to jesus and yet it went past from family to family tradition to tradition about hey there's going to come a prophet now we've been hearing and hearing and hearing and hearing of the coming of the coming of the lord and friends it's come so simple through the voice of a seventh angel that the word of god has spoken to it and people have missed it the spiritual coming they have missed it a million miles why because it's too simple he came through a seventh grade educated man it came to somebody that had a a a peculiar birth and had a father that was a a murderer and he himself decided desire to commit suicide and it all taints everything that came forth but yet it was the word of god coming through that microphone amen we believe yes sir i want you to notice and we'll get into maybe in just a few minutes but friends we're not worshiping eliezer this morning come on eliezer was a microphone who were worshiping the god that one the rainbow above his head that came down and brought the word of god through a mouthpiece the voice we're praising god for that one who is coming the king of kings he is still here this morning he hasn't disappeared he didn't die in 1965. we're not going to a pyramid grave to see if he comes back out no he's alive he's in the mechanics and the dynamics and he's the same yesterday today and forever i'm glad you believed that this morning hallelujah amen so these modernized jews you know they jesus came they're blown off the scrolls and they were looking to see could this be him how this was and they were looking for a sign but i want you to notice they had forgotten that this prophet was going to be different than all other prophets they were not reading between the lines how many knows where the prophet of god said read between the lines they couldn't see that this was the prophet not just a prophet but was this was the prophet that was to come the messiah their eyes were not supernatural eyes but i want you to notice amongst a whole generation of people there was friends there were two that were amongst them that could see the glory of god and i was so glad brother gerald this morning you read that scripture because i want you to notice the scripture and i'm going to read it in a moment or speak about in a moment the scripture said these people they were led by the spirit of god you know this person he moved by faith and not by sight brother branham says simeon was a great man hallelujah a great man led by the holy spirit now i stopped here this morning how many simians do we have today how many animals do we have come on hands should be in the building come on come on believe it by faith you're led by the spirit yes amen come out of your shells this morning in the name of jesus christ hallelujah we're simians and we're in us led by the spirit of god brother says great man a great man led by the holy spirit do you believe in being led by the holy spirit certainly he says hallelujah and simeon was a great man he was an honorable man a priest and late in the in the years of 80 80 as we're told and he stayed in the temple i want you to notice he stayed from the very place that he knew eventually the messiah would come here's my plug this morning you friends you need to be in the house of god oh but i can stream it's a buffet of streaming out there right now if i want to go hear this brother today i'll go here man i'll go hear that brother there and i'll be spiritually fed i want to tell you this morning in the name of the lord jesus god has called a fightful ministry and one of them is your pastor glory be to god it's truth anyhow he's called our a man of god who's a pastor that

to the great shepherd and there's an anointing friends that comes down to feed this congregation now you can go and you can casually stream and you can enjoy the buffet that's out there but the anointing for you in this hour where you will see the great god behold greater than solomon where you will see his glory friends is right here in this tabernacle and the scripture says don't forsake

out there we get our vaccinations but let me tell you the great vaccination is right here for every sickness every sin everything the lord jesus speaks i'll tear down the walls and i'll build you up again friends this in the house of god is where god is moving oh praise the name of the lord he was a priest or a teacher in the israel but it was revealed to him by the holy spirit that he was not going to see death until first he seen christ and job in their inspiration he said though the skin worms eat my flesh yet i will see god that's your testimony friends in this generation we're promised to see the coming of the lord and our bodies to be changed from mortal life to immortality but if you go by the way of the grave speak it like job i will see god it's a promise unto me oh death where's your sting all grave where is your victory why can we say those words because we have the joy by the word knowing who we are that we are the logos of god and we can see him by the supernatural intermittence and we know that one day we shall rise or our bodies will be changed praise the name of the lord oh he wasn't afraid brother brown says and he was not afraid to make the statement to all the people are you afraid this morning other people that are afraid this morning to testify of christ i say no i think there's a people here this morning says come what may come what may though i lose my job though i lose my family though i lose it all i will stand for christ he stood for me i will stand for him who praised the name of the lord he wasn't afraid to stand with the people no matter what his name was or his prestige was or his little the holy spirit had revealed to him oh god revealed to us this morning the holy ghost had revealed to him that he was not going to see death till he first seen the christ hallelujah now look he says no one had ever seen christ he had been spoken of it from the very dawn of time from the beginning in the garden of eden and fourth hallelujah four 000 years had passed and every great man had looked for him to come on earth the jewish stream of blessed i guess is the purest there is on earth tonight looking for the messiah to come and they watched the child be born and they were they were looking for it but simeon had a revelation simeons this morning ought to be praising oh simeon had a revelation of the holy spirit and he was not going to see death until he first saw the christ he was going not going to die until he saw christ and when god tells you anything it's positive truth and he cannot get away from it it's got to happen and this morning we've heard a voice we've heard the voice he's spoken to us and he's telling us it's got to happen oh i met him he's come to me though i could not come to him he came to me and he began to speak his truth to him and i said amen i said amen i said amen he began to minister to my very being and telling the secrets of my heart and i said oh how did you know oh and i began to say amen to his word because he alone could discern my very heart oh i want to ask you what is the word telling you this morning you're hearing me yell and scream and spit at you what is god saying to you this morning what is his positive truth to you today you know you know in your hand you have the scripture right here before you god's love letters to you you have it right before you and we see the message of the hour that message of the hour is pointing to our time our season our fulfillment of the word so i ask you today do you ha are you receiving this positive truth that's in your hand have you placed him in your heart listen friends we hear it for the faculty of our earring but hearing but it needs to get right to my heart it needs that positive truth it needs to get on the inside though it hurts so it doesn't sometimes cause too many smiles on our face because we got to be conformed and and transformed to the word friends but still it is the word nonetheless apply it let it become part of you place it from your hand and place it into your heart oh i sometimes think that we we have a gospel that we participated sometimes makes the truth how many's got their bible this morning can you show me your bible don't let it just go here on your head tuck in your heart a to z he said i am the alpha i'm the beginning amen i am the end i am eternal these are my thoughts to you oh oh oh not just the book of revelation wonderful awesome know all of the book the book of revelation said to take the book and eat the book let it be part of you he's the same one throat he's the from a to z jehovah of the old is jesus of the new that jesus of the new manifest himself in this day let this become part of you why don't you blow it off and not allow this jesus just to be a faint part of your memory but allow him to come into the forefront of your memory and sisters when you're going shopping you pull out a dress and you look at it in the forefront of your mind you say jesus would you like me to wear this come on we'd have no problems with modesty we would have no problems with boys wearing shorts or looking like sisters or acting if we would take the mirror of the word and hold it before us and say jesus would you be happy with what i look like and i want to tell you jesus is not going to come out under for under his word he's going to tell you exactly and he's going to go and he's going to point you right to what the prophet said the question is are you going to take that word and are you going to place it in your heart amen oh when he says you ought to take the dynamic of the word and live it and you got a sick baby at home or you got a negative situation at work or something's going on can you speak the word with the authority by the word on your situation well the word says you can if you're an adopted son and daughter of god you carry all the possessions of the father you're placed in the governor intuited and at the point in time the father stood and he announced to all the people this is my son he's this is listen friends this is to you not just to jesus this is to you this is my son oh he's under a governor and a tutor and i will lead him continually but i want you to know that all the authority lays upon my son and my daughter all the authority they've tucked it in their heart they you know friends they spoke the word they had a toothache and they said in the name of jesus christ it starts by a toothache if you've got a cancer in your body that's way big but start with a toothache that's just gnawing yet giving you a headache speak to that and see god's word fulfilled you look at your bank account friends now listen god said he'd always feed us but look at your bank account if it's at a negative this morning and i'm not preaching prosper prosperity this morning i'm just giving you a thought of faith look at it and you can say in the name of jesus you can help me get out of this situation by your words as we preached already by your words is a testimony of what god has done by your words you can show the world yes sir greater than all the prophets is here amen glory hallelujah so jesus said no by no stretch of imagination was he just a prophet he was the prophet upon the earth and brother brown says god and providing healing he said to this generation he said every type in the old testament was met in him and he was and is god everlasting the provided sacrifice for sin and sickness in him dwelt the power to omit to forgive every sin that was ever committed in christ jesus in the life now remember back to the token brother brandon begins to talk about animal life and how animal life was just a covering they'd come year by year they would sacrifice and the blood would pour and that god would forgive their sins but it was just a covering for sin but the blood of jesus christ it was god's blood it was the blood of god created life there was life in that blood and it was the life that covered our sin and that's why brother branham says there was every power in that life was there to omit sin hallelujah oh friends that life that attribute of life is inside of you her lord jesus came in fullness but on the day of pentecost friends you receive that life that life is inside of you and when you speak the word that life comes forward oh brother branham says here hallelujah sin sickness came an attribute of sin and when sin was brought into the world sickness followed it death followed it and jesus come to make uh a riddance of sin and and when he read sin he ripped every attribute of that sin produces he destroyed it all you asked me why listen friends i can't contain myself in those songs this time my sins are gone the brothers said this morning that must be a deep sea well thank god because i don't want any of you go fishing in that sea for my sins oh there's a sign that brother brandon said there's no fission and satan you cannot fish there i'm a son and daughter of god so everything friendzoned he read every attribute of sin brother branham says i hope you see it tonight when he killed sin he killed everything that sin produces he killed worry oh my he killed temper he killed everything that produces sin so think in your life for just a moment that sin produces worry how many of us are worry words oh i worry about this and i worry about that and i i'm fearful about this and i'm fearful of that and oh all of a sudden when you're worried and you're fearful and it's consuming you all of a sudden temporarize come on and before you know it it says you just are angry and you're angry all the time but i want you to know god has come to omit all of that to change that that thing out of your life now let me tell you this the prophet god links different spirits together and when you've got worry and you've got fear and you've got temper when you're angry all the time brother branham says you invite cancer how many still want to be mad right we don't oh i don't want can't cancer away from it no no friends you are accepting these things satan only can get through to you by by by giving you a thought and you have to receive that thought and when it comes into your thought mental uh faculties then it begins to work on your spirit and all of a sudden reasoning comes and you begin to reason well i remember when i was sick and i had that little spa and now i have this spot and i remember that guy with no face i remember i first thought oh my goodness now now you start worrying oh my goodness the brother did it at breakfast oh my goodness i better shave my beard maybe i've got something underneath there you know you begin to worry you know everybody gets a fret hang on friends that is reasoning taking control look at that thing and say in the name of jesus christ i cursed you satan and then you need a little help from the doctor because it's kind of gory to cut it off yourself right who wants to have that rose butter yucky looking spot in your body it's offensive and nobody wants to see that to go to the doctor not because it's cancer there's no life in it as soon as you accept it it cuts life that's the words from the prophet as soon as you receive it it becomes a life and then you have to come and the elders of the church anoint you with oil and we curse the life and you have to believe the life is gone but symbolize the process okay make it simple look at the thing and say satan you're done go to the doctor get that silly thing cut off get the stitches and by god's grace you move along i don't care what it is believe the word of god first and then ask for the doctors the second because god's already who does the healing the brother says i can't do the healing the doctor says i can't do the healing it's god that's got to do the healing but you can stop the devil at the door stop worrying amen stop fearing stop with your temperance and your bad behaviors and realize that god through the blood through the life that was in the blood has already omitted sin for you oh an example of scripture this morning is the woman at the well in john chapter 4 you know that woman of the well came and jesus you know he needed to see her i'm gonna paraphrase in my own words i hope you can don't mind for that but here we go here comes a woman from the well she had to come a different time than any other women because she was not accepted and jesus he he knew he needed to meet this woman and he realized that disciples also would have a critical spirit so critical spirits and negativity around it doesn't work jesus god has got to disperse all of it remember that woman was laying sick he took everybody to leave the room and leave him alone with that sick person say negativity that's why when we pray for somebody in the house of god if you're negative if you're against the word of god please leave the building before we pray because we can't have no negatives present people need to get healed they need to get what they need from god and we can't have negative people in the building just as jesus couldn't do it and we see though so jesus sent all the disciples away and they begin to sit there and they begin to converse with this woman and you know the conversation and before the the you know it the woman begins to say you know we know the messiah should come which is also called christ and when he would come he will tell us all things and jesus he discerns their heart he says unto her well i i'm the god that's speaking to you really you're the guy yeah i'm the guy and all of a sudden when he told her her problems now jesus is telling your problems this morning he that is greater than all the prophets being here this morning that mighty angel with that rainbow above his head he's speaking to you this morning through the voice of the message and so she realized oh her eyes began spiritual he looked just like any other man sitting there he was a jew talking to samaritans jews samaritans didn't come together in fact she should have left her pot and took off but she was curious that something was speaking to her just like it speaks to ours and she came and she then began to he began to speak to her told her her needs and then what did she do her supernatural eyes were not her natural eyes her supernatural eyes came open and the scripture says the woman then left her water pot and went away to the city and saith unto them and she began to testify come and see come and see right but i want you to notice what she did this is powerful to me i hope it does the same to you i want you to realize that she knew herself that her sins were omitted do you know how that she left her water pot she left her own life behind she left it all she accepted the word for the time and her season and the word said she was cleansed the word said she was forgiven all those other husbands and all the things she'd ever done they were now under the under the under the atonement for sin and she went free why because the master because he that was greater than all the prophets he's the one who told her that you are free and she left her water pot and she began to testify that's why we testify that's why we give praise to god that's why we go to our places at work and say hey this is what jesus did for me and they say dude that's enough i don't want to hear your words now okay you don't hear my words but maybe somebody else wants to do it you know one of the hardest things in my life was i got this revelation in my heart that i i needed to do a little more sacrifice of praise for the lord you know i got a little caught up in my own self and you know something lordy he put it on my heart so in edmonton we have a main street you know and and on that main street has all kinds of pubs and godly places and so forth and it's kind of a vibey place it's where people go right and it's called white avenue and people love to go and they can get ice cream during the day and they can do their world things at night and so i called a group of brothers together because misery likes company and i had groups of brothers that said well you got to come at least i'm going to stand on the street now and sing and i i'm going to preach now that does not often get done in edmonton all right and the guys that have done it before ended up with black eyes so i'm quite sure that this was going to be a very test of my sacrifice of praise but i i needed to do it for the lord i wanted to tell the lord now this is my testimony but i wanted to tell the lord that i was not ashamed of him okay and now and not only this i worked in the hospital all right and the hospital was like four blocks away from where i was standing and i knew at any given moment there would be direct dos doctors and there'd be nurses coming down for ice cream and they'd be coming for lunch and there would be poor old boys steve wanted to be popular at work you know because getting on with the doctors well you know something he buys me a coffee and donuts and gets me special privileges but now the lord has spoke to my heart steve you've got to go there and give a sacrifice of praise oh well i stood up there and i was singing at first i listen i'm just like you thank you lord for saving this that wasn't enough praise me boy right thank you you know i obviously you know i can sing louder than that right pretty soon you know something so the lord invited another brother with me that was tone pitch man he could not sing to save his life i mean he made us cross out good and so the funny thing with the lord he's got a sense of humor so i invited this guy to come along and he sang at the top is his lungs because he ain't ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ and he had the awfulest voice and i thought to myself oh lord if he can do it here i go see how the lord does things right so i started singing we started praising the lord and i opened my bible and i started preaching and and again to low and quiet before you know i got boldness you know we had all kinds of people test my faith this was not a rose i had people that came and shouted in my face and people came and gave me an ungodly way and they did all kinds of things to me you know i felt very low in my spirit many times but you know something after a few weeks i i got into praising the lord and i'm telling you all of this for the moment there's one fella he came up and he was in poor shape he looked like a ragged bum you know he just oh a long beard clothes tattered and he smelled like cigarettes and alcohol he didn't smell i mean he didn't and i you know in my natural self i felt like saying hey move along okay i'm here to preach to the nicolaitans okay all the doctors and the lawyers that can't receive christ i'm here to preach to them not you dude yeah man you know this guy said but what are you saying so i opened my bible and i preached him and you know it wasn't the most exciting service because you know what i was like man you know i had every scripture to say i'm chris you know i'm casting pearls before swine really i i'm telling you how i felt everyone might do carnal that's just how it was yet i felt in my heart to go and preach the gospel on the street so anyways i laid out some scripture to me and i told him how sin could admit and what i'll say he could thank you very much and he stomp off so i said thank goodness i keep preaching you know i can preach with zeal on the streets and i'm preaching days and weeks go on and we stand on the street and i'm standing here now and you can probably figure the end of the story but i'm going to tell you anyways for the glory of the lord i'm standing there and i'm preaching again and here comes this nice looking fellow got a nice button-up shirt and shaved and combed and everything he comes up to me hi i just want to shake your hand i said oh well god bless you i said do you know the lord he said yep i said oh okay he said remember a few weeks ago do you remember that guy that came and asked you to to preach and tell me about what you're talking about the guy with the beard tattered clothes i was the guy you know what he left his own life i don't know where he is today but he heard the word of god even though i was so foolish and so reluctant i should have gone back to the message and read what the prophet said about giving the word of god to the the ones that were were trodden down and that weren't invited to the feast right i should have done that but you know i was just human but you know what the lord opened my eyes you know something everyone we are come across to preach the gospel because it's that life of the gospel it's he the greater than all the prophets is the one who's doing the speaking through our life that omits their sin and he's the one that causes us to leave our water pots and go and testify the one that saved me saved him the one that saved me saved you it's the same god i hope you're seeing what i'm saying today sin has killed everything that produces sin oh testify come and see is this not the christ isn't god in our midst oh he's in our midst okay i heard a testimony just now in your midst i don't believe the brother's here this morning but i think his name is brother vaishal right through a man's willing to give the gospel he seen a life he was thirsting out there i understand but with the desire in our heart is this your testimony he came into the house of god brother gerald heard the preaching the word and i believe that in his heart he went all the way back to india to tell his parents under the fear of persecution to tell him that jesus is alive and he's coming back and he's saying surely my eyes my supernatural eyes are open to see that greater than all the prophets is right here in saint john where the word of god is being preached by men of god come and see oh friends i want you to notice that was the time of jesus now i want you to notice from the time of jesus death with death would be 33 a.d to 1946 after 1913 years the final chapter begins amen there's a history of time here friends from the time of jesus to the time when the prophet came and began to preach in 1946 i want you to see that you're in the final chapter you're in the culmination as we hear all these words these beautiful words the culmination of the final of all things we're in the rapturing cycle how can we be in the rapture cycle why because he's in our midst changing our fibers listen you think it's just gonna be snap your fingers like a magician no he's right here working on the inward part of your inward being the one you're going to take home with you this bl this flesh is subject only to the one that's on the inside this guy likes to see him this guy is only subject he was a sinner he is a sinner we're born in sin these 16 elements come from sin and we bypass our theophany but one day friends we're going to be changed how does that start it starts by one cell believing the word of god one atom believing the god word of god and they're fusing together they're fusing together and one day friends you're going to reach your goal your purpose is going to reach your destiny the purpose of your life is not just to have children though we have children the purpose of your life is not just to come to church the purpose of your life is to reach your goal is to receive the word for the day each time you listen each time the word comes to your heart it's being fulfilled so that you can see in your heart and when it's time arise and shine the scripture says that in isaiah 60 arise and shine for your light is come the light has come to you not just to a generation it's to you personally and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee not a generation it's a supernatural revival inside of you oh man i would love to see the revivals you know with billy graham and ola roberts and even the time when brother brown filled the football fields but i want to tell you that when the third pool came when god began to speak and begin to tell the people to live by the word what happened the multitude left him all of a sudden we don't see these great big stadians anymore we don't see these things happening oh brother branham begins still he says we're going to have a healing line and so forth but watch i want you to notice it was something different it was now the word of god that was was was what had had been cast forth to receive the great rainbow trout so arise and shine friends your light has come zechariah said but there shall be light where in the evening time prophecies fulfilled right here in our midst people are looking to the future people are looking behind them what was but what's happening right now right here oh there shall be light where right in your life right where you live there's sight in the evening time you are receiving the sight to see who is who he is oh i hope i'm not too repetitive but i want to just fill us in who gave us sight oh it was the mighty angel which came down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head who is that mighty one it's christ jesus who did he speak through through that one revelations chapter 10 verse 7 through the voice of the seventh angel who did he who what did he say he said when when he begin to sound all the mysteries of god shall be finished and he shall declare to his servants the prophets and we have received that word what is that mystery i spoke it to you already it's christ in you oh i hope this all ties this whole weekend tithes because we ought to have joy in this i spoke a whole word on joy just to get us to the point that we should be excited this morning not happiness like christmas but joyful in our hearts that he's here with us abiding within us ah he has come to open the book he's come to loose the seals thereof the book is revealed to you it's an open book to you so why don't you read it amen [Music] why don't you study it why don't you find out the fulfillment of all of this not let's just point at a thing and say well i heard him the pastor kind of related something i kind of understand we got to have a guppy love and so no it's god to be part of you oh he you know he's kind of you know he's got you know people in prophet's day they came they're up all kinds of denomination and brother branham he he came amongst the people and god wanted to stir them now they see 1906 they had seen the power of god move but they weren't hadn't seen it yet how god was going to reveal it through this prophet so god had to rally the people up and what did he do the first thing he did he got their attention with brother brother and calls it the first pole how many knows what that is the first pole well well it was like the ministry of moses i remember when moses went to the burning bush and god said take off your shoes and through the whole thing and he said now put your hand in your your side moses put his hand in his side and when he pulled it out remember it was leprous and god spoke to him said now put it back in your hand again they put it in the side they came out clean and brother brandon began to teach us and tell us that full first pull ministry was that same kind of mystery god fulfilling himself he calm and he began to pray for the people and all of a sudden he began to see thrashes and signs and things that came on his hand and he began to tell the people he began to associate oh this kind of rash was with this and this was kind of like that and god began to and what did it do it began to pull together the little fish but god are just not god's not looking for immature people god's not looking for people that are just drinking milk and looking for little things god wants some people that are ready to receive all of him okay you can't take a little little bitty child which is a female and think that she's going to produce life it won't happen she's got to be a mature bride in order to produce life so then god began to work also in the ministry of brother branham and now he received the ministry of the second bull i remember that and the second point was that messiah sign just like jesus did to nathanael oh there's a man with no gow how did you know me before before philip called you i saw you under that tree and there be god begin to speak through that second poll natural words right through fishing man god is so simple you know i can imagine the theologians there that was studying the scriptures and they had their intellectual hat on uh here he goes again talking about fishing talking about hunting okay i know what they did they shut their ears off but there were some people that started to listen they saw what god did and all of a sudden now it was it happened with a hand well that's cool now all of a sudden their hearts were being discerned they come through the prayer line and he would stand there and say you know what listen here this is not me doing what god's doing and he's talking and talking which seems forever right and i feel like saying get on with it brother branham yeah come on rush it along but he said you know who i'm waiting for and he's sitting there and he's waiting and then the angel lord comes and then he says he's here and i'm testifying this morning of what god has done greater than solomon greater than all the prophets he's in the midst of the prophet and we see it on the on the prayer lines we see their god as i'm fulfilling his word and this messiah signs now your name is so-and-so martha and you live in this address no man could ever know what was it it was gathering together the little bigger fish they could see it they saw the smallies and he had the little biggers but that wasn't yet where it was at yeah and then brother adam says i was praying one day and the king's source struck my hand yeah now we're gonna get a message okay now it's just not the sign a sign because uh an evil an adulteress generation they just look for signs you see it people same today you know signs this is amazing people see signs and wonders and i love signs and wonders okay but they worship the sign so i driving down the road you know when you see a sign here's the sign and it's just go off over here to uh uh conception cove or whatever else here is that what it's called consensual you're driving right and you see turn left well people they stop and they say oh glory to god there's the sigh but the son is telling you to go somewhere isn't that right first poll the second poll it was a sign to tell us to go somewhere but you know people stop the car and they say glory to god for the sign hallelujah and they rally around the sign and they call their friends look at the sign look at the sign look at the wonders look at the gifts look so it's whatever happened god is pointing to us to somewhere else amen and then people there's another camp of people that say glory to god for eliezer well yes glory forgotten for eliza but not in the way they're saying it right how many remember brother random he said i had to shoot that serpent oh that servant was coming in and they were starting to worship me how do you remember that deity doctor and it went he shot it and it was wounded and went into into the water into the people friends that same spirit is still here today come on we got to guard ourselves against we want him the word of god now the vessel the eliezer man what a mighty man that was we cannot have a message without pointing to the messenger we cannot do it so we honor the messenger but i want to remind you that i love this this story of eliezer going to find isaac a wife oh he prays oh god how am i going to find her well i'm i'm gonna lead you i'll show you he says okay well the very one that will water my camels right so he goes down and he gets there and he meets this rebecca and this rebecca is humble she's humble and she he says that whole conversation begins to flow and and pretty soon she says i'll water your candles i'll give them with i'll give them a sustenance now rommy knows that water brings life i want you to notice the very camels that took her to her isaac was the same ones that she continually fed she was willing to feed oh she was willing to pull okay pull on the word pull on the holy spirit pull on what god has for her she had a humble heart now i want you to notice he spanked her and you're the right one and the conversation was beautiful and they went down to her uncle's place there i want you to notice what happened there there's an exchange eliezer said look she needs to come with me and she'll accept to come i like it but first of all i want to give you some gifts i want you to i want you to know that my master is real and i'm not some some some some burglar or some thief along the way i want you to know that i have a i mean that's a lot of miles yes there's a lot of traveling that's got to go so i'm going to give you some gifts to show you that my rep master is for real okay well she they only received she took the gift she put them on her life and she was wow this is great but i want you to notice the gifts wasn't the giver that's right did she say oh i don't want to wear this this is not for me no happiness in her heart to receive the understanding by a concrete evidence that that there was an isaac and i want you to notice now we don't count down on gifts the gifts don't save you the feelings don't save you the signs the wonders they don't save you it's he the word amen that saves you amen it's the one that was pulling on rebecca's heart to get on the camel the power to get her to isaac those are long journeys she began to say well could you tell me please what isaac's like yeah i'll tell you he's not like god three like your fingers come on he's one yes sir he's not one like your finger either he's eternal he's omnipotent he's all those things oh that's great i was wondering could you tell me why why do we need the sacrifice of blood oh this is why because you were defiled let me show you serpency did you know that i prayed and asked god for you to come so you're also elected and predestinated and let me show you by the word oh eliezer can you tell me more and send in your words helias or give me more of god's word oh yeah that's right here it is here it is and begins to play it but i want you to notice some brother jarrah when she got there and she saw this man standing in the field and his back was turned her and he was by his mother's tent representing life she looked and she knew his front parts she knew his back parts she knew his side parts she knew all about him why because ali ager did a fantastic job amen alligator did an amazing job to describe to her what isaac looked at now i want you to notice she she didn't cry and lament that she was going to just pop off and go to isaac no no she said thank you sir i appreciate it sir but my eyes are on isaac do you think she brought uh lease or disrespect after they journeyed together with isaac aleeza after do you think she brought any disrespect to ellie easter the rest of the trip like oh you're nothing no she said eliezer was so good he told me all about you and what did she do she went together with isaac she went into his chamber and there became an invisible union of the bride what did happen what happened just right there she recognized who isaac was she recognized that right in her midst greater than all the prophets greater than anything any first pull any second paul that the third paul ministry was in her most bringing life the word brings life it's rapturing faith in the word of god it's life in human flesh today the thoughts of god that's what we see today in this hour i and you are the proof of the resurrection and the life we are proof that what happened in the first poll and the second poll was truth we are proof of today that there that the third paul ministry that life of jesus christ is in our hands we are the proof of who he is he's the alpha and omega but can your eyes be open to see can you see who he is those ones now i'm closing those that were on the road to emmaus i love this story they were walking and they were downtrodden because they felt that you know jesus had left them as they began to walk there was a stranger to them they thought join them and he walked them all along the way and they begin to speak about the truth and their the scripture said as he begin to speak to them their hearts burned within and now their hearts burned but they didn't know who he was yet that's right oh praise the land and they walked and they walked and he talked and he talked but i want you to notice he came to the end and they persuaded him please come and stay we enjoyed our conversation it's burning in us please stay spend a minute a few moments before you go and she and there that stranger said sure i'll come in and he sat down and i want you to notice where their eyes were open it wasn't about all the talk and the things that they understood intellectually it was when they had a supernatural moment with the stranger and what did he do he took the bread and he broke it jesus said i am the bread of life he broke his word friends don't be gluten free now huh no sir eat him he's the bread of life break the bread of life and what happened their supernatural eyes were opened oh and a songwriter once said all at once he walked beside me like he'd been there all along not a stranger but a father who could sense when something's wrong and he answered all my questions and he understood my fears that somehow vanished now that he is near can you see he's here this morning can't you see who walks with me who walks with you it's the one that's breaking the bread for you it's not any man the man is going to hinder you it's the bread of life he's here this morning greater than all the prophets who is walking he's the one that's speaking in their name always saying that so i have a maker he knows my name he's the one this morning who's speaking to you can you see who walks with him oh and you have this heart i couldn't bear like last night we just wanted to be in the presence of god was saying over and over and i'll go why i couldn't bear for him to leave me so i begged him please to stay spend the evening a few moments before he went his way like a host he turned and blessed broke the bread just as he's doing and he's doing over again not just this meeting but continually through the voice that we hear on the tapes and the voice that's spoken through our pastors he's breaking the bread oh can't you see friends that this day this scripture that's according to the word of god of revelations chapter 10 this day this day this scripture is fulfilled and our eyes are open to see that greater than all the prophets is here this morning yes sir he's here with you amen heavenly father can we receive it by faith can we receive it by supernatural eyes by the scripture by the word of god that says that she has become him can we see what that means lord that's meat that's
