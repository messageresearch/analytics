earth because I know you're the apple of his high yeah and it's a great privilege just to be called a brother or a sister in this great endtime message I want to bring greetings from the group in iron Falls as you know we lost our pastor but God see us through you know he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us and he will provide a man because he loves his Rebekah we are in the tent with him getting ready to bring forth the sons of God not on the earth I believe that the bride is sugilite bring forth the sons resurrection as we sang the first course word of God never true changing me and changing you a man and that's what it's all about a change in this hour I believe that God is changing us for mortal dream mortality and the song that I want to sing tonight it's a testimony really it's my personal actually this was me but God delivered me as he delivered you right and has he delivered David David said the Lord is my light he's my strengths and that he's my salvation he's all in all praise the Lord Nene and this song that speaks about sin and if we get away from the Word of God where the devil will take us I believe the brother made reference in this message last night to this brother Karsan told me some of the things he was speaking on so I said this would be a very fitting song to sing that sin will take you further than you want to go amen of course sin is our belief so we must stay with the pure truth because if we disbelieve one word brother Brown said we're insane this kingdom I'm so glad to see you sister combo god bless you brother Josh for our sister

I'd like to just come in and take complete control lord my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

will fade away crumble be burned up and the other will go on into glory and and become an eternal house hey why don't we might turn in our Bibles this evening I'd like to just start the Book of Isaiah chapter 53 we just like to read verse 1 and we're trying to speak on three words prophecy preeminence and perfection and doesn't seem like we're speaking on it but it last night we tried to approach prophecy as far as a light shining in darkness and and so this evening we just we want to continue with this thought of prophecy but more on the aspect that the prophecy has an effect opponents if it's revealed and so then I want to look at that in the light of these three words so then we'll read right here and I'd like to read also Matthew 11 and verses 25 to 27 along with this with this verse here I was listening that brother sing that song tonight and a little bit better than I do I've never been a singer when I was a young boy I remember that my mother sent me and my sister to a Vacation Bible School and of course during Vacation Bible School they're getting ready for their graduation so they get all the children that are that are going to Vacation Bible School and then they kind of like a little choir and you're gonna sing a song when it comes to graduation day for all the parents you know and so then they they had us all lined up when I remember I was up on the on the back tier there and so we were practicing this song and so though the woman that was the Sunday school teacher she said okay wait a minute wait a minute she's Michael would you not sing you're throwing everybody off key in front of you so that was probably my first experience in a Honan and then I always thought I was tone-deaf but I've been told since then I'm not really tone-deaf but I thought when you went lower you knowing the key I would just sing lower and softer and I'd stay right there at the same place the monotone you know and then when to sing higher are just got louder and I thought louder was higher and lower with softer but anyway I got where I thought I could sing you know fairly decent and we had a visiting preacher one time and I don't know you know we get these what we call biorhythms and I don't know if you notice it but sometimes you get up and you go to write and you'd be looking at your hand right and then you say and then you know I could write that good that really looks good and it just seems like it just you know and then you'll get up and then you go to write and its scribbling you can't do nothing with it and you think what what's wrong here it just seems like it's not working right and it's something to do with your bottle rhythms you know I guess but anyway I was up there and and I was I was closing out with a song and as I was singing I thought you know pretty good you know this I'm doing pretty good you know it just sounded like it was really really nice you know so when I got outside the visiting brother he says hmm he says I see you're a little bit like me you can't carry a turn in a bucket so sometimes when we think we're doing pretty good we ain't done all the goods we think we are been in Isaiah 53 and we read this who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and then also in Matthew 11 and in verse 20 and 5 these are the same scriptures that brother Branham used of course when he preached God and simplicity and I just wanted to begin here Matthew 11 verse 25 at that time jesus answered and said I think the old Father Florida heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither North any man the father saved the Son and he to whom the son will reveal him and we bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your mercy and grace this evening and Lord we thank you for the sense of humor that we might have not to make your house a house of jokes or just laughter but the Lord you want your people to have join their hearts and father I just pray to forgive me for that little comment there of life and how we all go through these things before we seriously in our heart approach the throne of mercies tonight and without you we can do nothing and father I ask that you would just inspire every one of us Lord speaker in here that we might be inspired by you and caught up Lord in the mind of Christ that we might be in one soul one spirit and one Accord and Lord may you anoint us Lord may you pour out your annoying all of your holy spirit father God that you might break any yoke and his federate for that would that would hold us Lord from your presence or from receiving your word father may you bless each one that's come maybe bless our gathering together and may you bless the reading of your word we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen you all may be seated and we're just talking about prophecy and this is this is one principle that we we learned from the scriptures and that we've been taught in these last days by the holy spirits or a prophet that revelation comes from God it doesn't it doesn't come by man or is the efforts but it comes sovereignly by God as we said last night brother Branham was was talking about in the ever-present water of the rock and how that you and I have enough power to create worlds if we're born again because the life of God is in us and the life of God is gone but he said that power is controlled by law he said there's something restricts that and then he referred to to Jesus Christ and how that when he died he said his body went to the grave he said his spirit went back to God to give it and his soul went down there into hell and he said now he stayed down in there three days and three nights and he said he couldn't rise again because there was a he called it a bar or there was a law and that was the Word of God had held him there three days and three nights because the scripture said it was the sign of Jonah and that he would stay he would stay in hell three days and three nights and on the third day raised again before the corruption set in because he said I not suffer my Holy One to see corruption or soul stay in hell so then the word of God was that limitation or it was that bar that held him not necessarily against his will but to fulfill the word that bar held him so he was talking about that law and that bar and how did it help Christ and it had to come according to the word so then he returns back to this thought oh that you've got enough power now to create worlds but there's a law there's a bar there's something that keeps you from creating that world and doing what you want to do with your human spirit along with the divinity that's in you and the power and the authority that you have so we have authority he said but we don't have power so however much authority you have that's much power that you can exercise or how much faith that you have to use that that power that you have some now the power that's in me now being born again and filled with the Holy Ghost that the limitation of the exercising of that is limited by faith and faith is what operates or releases the power that's within us and he says now God controls that and he said he said now that that's not it's not how obedient you are to the word but he said faith he said it's how much God leads your soul to believe that's how much faith that you have so now God controls the amount of faith and faith is a revelation faith cometh by the hearing of the word now faith is not the hearing of the word but the avenue of the Word of God by an anointed service son of God to bring his word to the people is the Avenue that God can anoint in the heart of an individual to bring faith so faith cometh by the hearing of the word but all it hear the word don't have faith but it's we find it's those that's inspired because the inspiration whatever God leads your soul to believe however much inspiration he brings to you that's how much power that you can have and so then he goes on in the message and he drops back down he says now Israel when she got out there in the wilderness she got her faith got away from her he's there but they didn't lose their covenant but they just they just got away from the faith and then he comes down and then he picks back up where he dropped off and he says now he said you don't need to pray for more power he said but what you need to do is pray for more faith he said what you need to do is live such a godly life that when you pray and your heart doesn't condemn you you can have what you ask so then when I when I'm reading that then faith it releases that power now we're looking for rapturing faith that's a revelation God is going to have to inspire us to bring us to that it's not talking to somebody that's that's resurrected and all of a sudden just a funny feeling but we find that there's faith that's involved into this for God to release that power to change our bodies into a glorified body and so what lies in the key of how much faith that God releases to you and I lays in character because character without power is satanic that doesn't mean that doesn't mean it's going to go out and do devil things and witchcraft things but it means it's going to be operated by that person's self will to achieve what they want in life good bad or ugly doesn't make any difference but character because it's the character of Christ submits itself to the will of God so it doesn't go out here operating power according to its own desires but according to the will of God that's released in that individual and that's what true character is because it's the character of Christ and the character of Christ to be like Jesus it's not just raised them to dead and doing good things but to be like Jesus I come not to do my will but my father's will Paul when he wanted to go a certain direction he had a what maybe he thought was just a leaning of the Spirit he wanted to go a certain way but the Holy Ghost forbade him to go and he didn't keep pushing but he just went the way that God sent him he saw that man over to Macedonia so then he followed the leading of the Lord so there's things that we do we get up we go to work we do things but you know there's times that God intervenes and he tries to inspire us or influence us to do a certain thing and then there's other times that we have the reveal will his reveal will when the Supreme when the scripture says his Commandments you know they that obey His commandments what is that that's his revealed will it's not the Ten Commandments but it's the Word of God it's like the man it's the Word of God in your day the day that you're living and that's the commandments of God when Saul was disobedient to Commandments he said he's left off obeying my Commandments he didn't follow me anymore what was he referring to he was referring to the Word of God that came through Samuel to him to go destroy the Amalekites and so we find it now that when Jesus said he that loves me and obey my Commandments is not obeying in loving the things he wrote here in the Gospels that's part of it but it's what he's speaking today Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever God manifested in his Vail today and speaking to us then that's the commandments that's his revealed will to you and I we have the written wheel we have a reveal will and we have a permissive will but we also have in that a hidden will be finder sometimes in your life God uses natural circumstances to fulfill spiritual circumstances when it came time for Mary and Joseph to go to Jerusalem he didn't he didn't send another angel he didn't send Gabriel and say thou must go to Bethlehem to have this child because so say at the scriptures in the Bible that out of Bethlehem of Judea comes his child he didn't do that what'd he do he caused a tax law and him being from Joseph being from Judea it forced them by the tax law by the government that doesn't seem too divine but it was God bringing to pass a hidden will in a life to put them in a natural circumstance where they could be part of the orchestra of the sheet music to bring forth Jesus Christ from Bethlehem so God has a reveal will he has a permissive will he has a hidden will I remember one time I was I was wanting to in my natural thoughts I was wanting to witness to my to my mother and so I I was supposed to meet her in north of Dallas Texas and that's where my sister and my brother-in-law were living so I got a whole stack of books and I thought this is it I'm going to see my mama and I'm gonna witness to her you know and she said Michael she said I just can't believe that your you're a Christian you're saved she said you least of all the children he said when I oh god save I was just a crude rude atheist just oh my using the Lord's name in vain and just oh I just hate I just sometimes I break out and sweat thinking the things I used to say into them and so I went and when I got out there I heard this voice you know and it was my brother-in-law and we got to talking and he got into it I ended up giving all the books to him now I took the books after from my momma but the Lord wanted me to give the books to my brother-in-law and so sometimes you arrange natural circumstances to put you into a place that you want to use you in a spiritual way so then we always have to be sensitive to those things are around us to feel a little pull feel a little little nudge and he don't come to me and I've never had him say no Michael I want you to do this i I've never heard voices that way I have had them speak out of my heart and it's just like a different voice it's just you know sometimes you think you'd be thinking things and then then there's all the sudden errs that there's a voice that speaks to you and you know what's coming out of here but yet it's not it's not your own thinking and it's another voice I don't know how to explain it it's not an audible voice but it's a voice is speaking in the thoughts of your mind and I'm haven't speak that way but so then God's commandments is his revealed will to you and I there's a written word that's the reveal world and there's the voice of God to you and I and that's his commandment that says that's his revealed will and the day that we live and so Saul had left off not the Ten Commandments he had probably obeying all out but he left off following the voice of the Prophet and when God accused him of that he said he said Samuel Saul has left off obeying my Commandments he's not following me so in order to follow God we've got to follow his Commandments jesus said if you love me you'll keep my Commandments and if you keep my Commandments my father he's going to love you and he'll love you and I love you and I will manifest myself to you so we find that the manifestation of God in his veil is hinging or depending upon your obedience to His commandments but as Commandments it's not it's not here in this Bible it says revealed will in the day that you're living that's what makes prophecy so important this Bible how do we know that this is God's Bible because in here this book is a prophet and the prophecy vindicates the book that this is the book from God and not man because then here is prophecy Israel in our homeland it vindicates that this book is God's Word because that prophecy has come to pass when God said I'm not going to speak to you anymore I'm going to speak through man and I'll speak through my prophets then the first question is well how do we know that the voice of this prophet is your voice because it's false prophets he said when that prophet speaks and he speaks a vision or dream and it comes to pass fear that man [Music] fear that man because God is with them so even the vindication of the Prophet is the fulfillment of the prophecy but then there's also a testing of your own hearts and the test of your heart is that when a prophet prophecies and it comes to pass or if he tells a dream and it comes to pass but he leads you to other gods now God is not trying the Prophet he's trying your hearts as the Scriptures so when he tries your heart is to see whether you gonna stay with his word his commandments or not or whether you're gonna go after the supernatural though the voice is a smooth of a stranger and not the voice of the word and how do we know it's the voice of God there's two things he said how do we know it's the voice of God he said the supernatural always accompanies the voice of God to the voice that God will always be scriptural so it must be scriptural it must be supernatural and he tries your heart he's trying to hearts of the people that claim to be bride today and if a person claims to be the church who claims to be the bride God will take you at your word but you will help be held accountable for the position that you take if you say I am bride God will hold you accountable for the actions of the bride when Saul stepped in the position that was not his he stepped in the position of a priest and that was not his position God takes these things very seriously that Saul lost the throne and his seed after him lost all the inheritance of what God had taken and that was ripped back from him the serpent stepped into a position that was not his he stepped into the position of Eve's husband and she was he was not her husband and he was cursed by that now we find men standing in the position of a woman and woman trying to stand in the position of a man that's a dangerous that's a dangerous place to stand in a position that's not yours ministers people that are called it say that through ministers if they're not called to be a minister and they've taken that position as a minister and are not called that's a dangerous position to be in so the bride must recognize her position and you must recognize what God has called you to be and that's the position that were to be in so we don't want to take somebody else's position or stand in the position that's not ours he said down to the church ages he said both the true vine and the false vine claimed to be the church so he addressed them as the church and held them accountable but remember you can never be the church without the life of God in you you can never fulfill the law without the life of the lawgiver in you because man cannot fulfill the law in his obedience but it takes a sacrifice and it takes the life of the law giver in you he's not called us to be obedient to the law but he has given us the FULFILLER of the law and placed his life in you and I that thrill life that we can fulfill that law so now he's going to reveal himself he's going to make manifest st. John 14 he's going to manifest himself or reveal himself to those that love him so well I love the Lord well how do you know well there's a way to test that number 1 do you love those that are begotten of him because if you can't love his children you can't love him because the word says you can't you say you can't why I love him but I don't love you that's not love you're in darkness and don't know that and your light has become a great darkness your revelation has become anti word now how do I know that I love him how do I know that I have the Holy Ghost because the love of God we're talking about deity in you we're not talking about human affections now we're talking about love and the way that Jesus discerned he said if you love me he said this this is this is the attribute of the love of Jesus Christ is that you obey my Commandments turn to st. John 14 so we can read that because this this isn't the same thought that we're in this list you can see this st. John 14 and look at verse 20 now verse 20 doesn't seem to be a prophecy but it is because brother Branham will be fearing that Saint John 14 and 20 said at that day he said now that day is this day so then that makes that prophecy because it's saying that that day when that day that he's talking about when this day comes that I'm sneaking of so this is prophecy at that day ye shall know that I'm and my father and my father and me and I on you and that's different as we were saying last night when he says Philip have I been so long with me as you don't know who I am when you've seen me you've seen the father if if your revelation had progressed while you walked with me you woulda known that I am Jehovah God in flesh and you would have known when you looked at me you'd be looking at God in flesh that revelation is held down through the church ages to the True Vine but now there comes an evolving of this and even though we've had it in an earnest because the Holy Ghost has been in an earnest bringing man to a resurrection but now the Holy Ghost is in its fullness now the Holy Ghost is not measured in quarts pounds ounces it's not it's not measured in anything like that it's measured in the amount of Revelation you have that's how much Holy Ghost that you have you're not going to you're not going to get more Holy Ghost more quantity wise but you will get it more in Revelation because the more revelation that you have the more faith that you have the more power you have the more manifestation of the life of God that you have in you in character and in demonstration according to his desires and will now watch verse 21 he that hath my Commandments and keepeth him now remember his Commandments is not the Ten Commandments it's not the law of Moses because he said I'm gonna write this in your heart we're in a new covenant he's not talking about the Old Covenant so what is the commandments it's the voice of God to you so in this day it's the voice of Malachi 4 it's not it's the punt it's the voice of Paul it's the voice of Peter but now we have a commandment because the Lord shall descend with a shout that's a message so he's not coming to repeat something he's coming to tell us something he's he going to open up his word it's something that he's not said until now so this is a new commandment even though there is no new Commandments he said I won't do a new thing but behold he said everything is under the Sun that's already been done but before I do a new thing I'm going to tell you of that so it's new but it's not new you know up is not always up up is deemed to be exalted you've got to first come down to humility and we're not talking about pimps and crawling around on steps and going up and kissing across we're talking about self will when self will is put under submission by your own desire and love to the will of God that you have willingly by loving constraint sacrifice your own self will for his will that you militant it's not it's not if it's me it's not wearing plain clothes it's not getting on your knees until they're bloody you know we have preconceived ideas I was thinking along the line of prophecy and we have preconceived revelation and we have in our body we have voluntary reactions I want to turn this page so I I reached down here I turn the page that's a voluntary reaction but my heart is pumping ain't making that heart pump that's an involuntary reaction so I don't know if you realize it or not but there's involuntary reactions in our in our spirit you pick up the telephone somebody calls it's one of these telemarketers you know and so I'm a man I just say it's a woman I pick it up she says hello you know what I automatically do I build a body around that voice whoever knows that you did that now you're not doing it you're not fantasizing I'm not talking about lust now you pick it up it could be a man you listen to him you already got his age he's about 55 he's short he's heavy dark hair and and then when you meet the guy he's tall thin blond hair he's not anything like his own that's a preconceived conception of what somebody is you build a body around that voice I remember brother Tim Pruett I don't know if y'all know brother tempura little short fella I'm short but he's a little bit shorter than I am and he said he was at a at a convention and and he met this brother in the hallway and he was walking through there and this brother stopped and said oh you know he said I heard brother Tim Pruitt's here he said I sure would like to meet him he said oh why don't ya and he looked down and on a little short power you know and he says no you aren't this is ya I am he said I'm brother Tim Pruett he says no you're not him he said I just listened to him on the tape he's about six foot he's got dark hair you know I'm big night he said you know him he said what my mama called me so I find also that when the word of God is preached especially when it comes to prophecy and we're going to look at this in a minute you know you actually you actually have a preconceived idea of what this prophecy is you don't necessarily do it on purpose and some people do because they begin to study and they begin to sow preconceived when I look it up it's something that you can see beforehand so before that this prophecy is revealed you have a preconceived revelation of that prophecy and so when that prophecy comes to pass you may be like that boy that was in that hallway and say that's not if they said Jesus you're not him because they could not separate his first coming in second coming they could not they could not understand that how he could be a man of sorrow and he could be a king how he could retake the throne of David and yet be a man that was rejected they could not separate the prophecy and the church today cannot separate the appearing and the coming so it's misconceived prophecy so when he came they had the prophecy but when they looked at him they had a preconceived idea brother Brown said they had their charts all drawed up and everything and he was going to roll out this red rug come down the red rug come right down to the Sanhedrin and he was going to introduce himself because I had a preconceived idea of theology of how he was coming but when he came in their eyes and the illegitimate child I thought this can't be God's childish cannot be Immanuel they say where'd he come from well he comes out of Nazareth what and and what's he preaching what's he teaching and because the preconceived ideas they could not recognize prophecy being fulfilled and Jesus said you have not recognized your day of visitation he said there was a time there was a time that God strove with you there was a time you could have recognized this but now that time has passed and because you haven't recognize your damn visitation you've rejected it he said there will not be one stone laid upon another and he refers to that as the rejected stone of the builders so as I was touching last night if you go to Psalms and it talks about that I think it's what songs on I forget where I wrote it it Psalms 119 that that he refers to this stone of stumbling so the stone of stumbling is not Jesus Christ the stone of stumbling is that word made flesh Saint John 1 the subject is not Jesus Christ the subject is the word they that received him who not Jesus the Word made flesh and that day it was Jesus but today it's not Jesus people pray in the name of Jesus they approach him in the name of Jesus and yet they're worshipping the devil so then it has to be that word made manifest so the cornerstone becoming the headstone is the word made manifest and Jesus Christ was rejected stone but it's more than that because Peter come out and they said what authority what power we did is in he said in the name of Jesus he said there's no other name under heaven that man might be saved he said this is that stone that was rejected to the master-builders it wasn't just Jesus it was the stone then prophecy being made manifest fulfilled and then if you go to Peter look at first Peter a moment go over the first Peter I touched on this last night first Peter I think it's first Peter first Peter chapter 2 and verse 4 look what he says here to whom coming as unto a living stone now he just got through saying we're born again not as a corruptible seed to talk about the seed that came from your natural father in the womb of your natural mother that's a corruptible seed but being born again from above in other words he's now bringing to us the same thing that Jesus said unless the man be born again from above he cannot enter into the kingdom of God flesh and blood don't enter into that he ain't talking about a glorified body don't have blood in that you and I have entered into the kingdom of God because we're born again we have been translated from the power of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son so there's a part of me that's already been translated and it's dragging my body to a translation my theophany or my soul is dragging this body it's changing the witness's hair they're changing the way it does his clothes it's changing the way it dresses and the talks and then acts that goes to church it sings why because there is a life that's dragging that body to a body change but dressing and whatever changes talking will never change it but the life that's in there you can talk like Jesus you can act like Jesus you can dress like Jesus in look like him but it's the life of Christ in you that makes you Christ a Christian and that life is dragging this body to a resurrection [Music] so being born again what are the word not the word that's preached but the Living Word the Word of God that liveth and abideth so this word that we're talking about is the same one that John talks about in in Saint John one as many as received him who him the word made flesh in this day and believed on his name not Jesus Christ but the word made manifest is the name of God [Applause] it's not just believing in Jesus we believe in Jesus because there's only one approach Jesus Christ the sacrifice gave his life for you and I and that's the key to our approach to the throne of mercy through the blood of Christ that's why we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I heard a man preach one time he said I pray in the name of the son of man he's gonna get nothing because the son of man didn't give his life Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ gave His life and through that name of redemption we approach him because God Rock redemption in the body of Christ a body he had prepared for himself and a body is prepared for himself today a church a tent the tabernacle of David and in there he places his his word is Ark no holiest of Holies one sacrifice once for all any priest could go in there and you were made kings and priests and anybody could go in the presence of the ark and David put recorders in there you know what swore because when those priests got in there they got anointed they got inspired and they sang the Psalms and they prophesied and they recorded those things and much of the songs is is it the priest that entered into that sanctuary David introduced something else when he came down there bringing that Ark they were singing they were dancing it was a Pentecostal Jubilee and when John saw that same Ark he began to he began to sing and shout till all the heavens was filled and then the angels had to come stand back when he began to sing read redeemed by the blood Allah I am I've been redeemed and when the ark came mighty God unveiled he said what are they screaming about what are they hollered about he said they broke through the veils of traditions and end his presence because the ark the word the message of the bride was coming to his place in the belly of John hen brother bran said you know why that prophet was instructed to read to eat that book he said he had to become one with him so that is a natural a natural allegory to show a spiritual taking place so whatever you eat that's what you become so whatever that you receive my inspiration that's what you are you're the word being made manifest so when the one that when the tent came to perfection when it came to completion down at the end of the age down at the time that that David looked at it okay it's ready let's go get the ark so at the end of the age when when the bride comes in this day that the last name that's on the last on the Lamb's Book of Life when it's redeemed the book is shot so we're in that dispensation so the word now is coming to his place the fullness of that word so watch what he says here now verse four chapter two first Peter to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed or rejected indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively or living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Christ so once that david offered that sacrifice the only sacrifices that was in the tabernacle of David was praise and worship and song and the lifting up of hands gentile dispensation wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone he lacked precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded shall not be confused shall not be ashamed unto you therefore which believe he is precious and who is he the word mate / but on to them which misdeal disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed rejected the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling we've come to a time that the cornerstone the head stone is coming what it's the fulfillment of the appearing of Christ that take his bride in a resurrection a body change and the metre in the air so we're at the capstone why because all down to the church ages what have we been waiting for Paul says he will appear the second time he has gone into heaven for us what at that throne forgiven father our intercessor that's Hebrews nine his he has gone into heaven to where the true Tabernacle the tabernacle that was on earth Solomon's Temple was only a shadow of the true Tabernacle when Jesus ascended he didn't go back to that tabernacle that he went to when he was 12 years old he went to the true tabernacle that was in heaven and there on the mercy seat he has appeared for you and I down to the church ages what for for loozer for Wesley for Pentecost for Columba well why was he there for them because he wasn't there for the sinner because the sinner never had claimed the sacrifice so then if the sinner he doesn't have any blood that's applied for him but it's waiting for them if any want to take a success today the brother Branham said he was sprinkling the blood on the mercy seat for the church why because Luther was doing what he was he had the doctrine of a devil baptizing in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost because he had only been released a partial restoration of the revelation of Paul they could not go any higher than the original revelation brought my Paul that was the limit that they could go to because that's as far as God had revealed his word and so then when when Luther was killing the Anabaptist which they believed they disbelieved in child's frequent they believed the child went to heaven when it died but when you got of age and accountability you had to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and be baptized they rejected infants wrinkling but Luther carried that doctrine from the Catholic Church remember the Lutheran Church is only the Reformed Catholic Church that means that the roots of it it's still a Catholic Church because it's only the Reformed Catholic Church and the Wesleyan Church is only the Reformed Lutheran Church the reformed Catholic Church because their daughters the true vine was never part of the Reformed Church our roots does not lay in the Reformation because the Reformation had children and those children were women they was harlots and they went back to their mom of the but down through the wall in these they carried that original revelation and the original text which became the foundation of the Reformation and where that Luther and in the wall in these original True Vine when they agreed on justification they could come together but when Luther failed to follow in the opening of the word they pulled away they never became we're not from the Reformation the reformers was only the carrier of the life of the team there's been two vines they have intermingled but they never become one in the same they never hybrid and so then he was sprinkling for those converts under the star of Luther for his and father they don't know what they do he said he was sprinkling blood on the mercy seat interceding for the church not the center why would he intercede for the center he did that at Calvary what they have to do is accept the work of Calvary but the church had accepted that work but they was in false doctrine so Wesley come along penny cuts come along he said they were reformers they were stars and he called him prophets because they spoke by inspiration but they were not word prophet [Applause] in your Bible when it talks of the seven churches you say it says to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus but when it comes to Sardis in Philadelphia to the Angel of the church in Philadelphia to the Angel of the church in Sardis but when it came to lay the sia it says unto the Angel of the Church of Laodicea to word prophets they weren't in the church the corrupted church they was of the church but they wasn't in that church you talk about a GPS age oh brother Mike I see you just five minutes early weren't you what well yeah it was and then I can I can stand anywhere and if I had the phone setup and I had the money I can just say where am i it show me the global earth and it showed me a Geico where I'm at this is the only age that we could recognize truly what age we stand in because God sent a GPS a prophet the shows where we're at in time we talk about GPS they haven't got anything but what you got through the revelation of God's Word in this day and they call it paranoia I call it revelation they call it heretic I call an eternal life so watch what he says here verse seven on to you therefore which believe he is precious but on to them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner a stone of stumbling now this stone of stumbling is not Jesus Christ the stone of stumbling is the word made flesh they headstone the capstone coming down he said now the capstone is here the capstone has become one we're not it's not Jesus come down but it's a fullness of his word under Malachi 4 revelation 10 revelation 8 luke 1730 all the scriptures that speak of this time it's the fullness he said he has poured out the fullness of his holy spirit we got we ain't got more Holy Spirit than what Paul had I've had people tell me they didn't have the Holy Ghost hey the Holy Ghost is a token they said the token couldn't come until 63 well that's funny Paul thought he had the token so does that make him a false prophet he was circumcised in heart what is a circumcision taking out the nature of the world taking out the first husband taking out the love of the world and what comes in the life of God the nature we have been become partakers of a divine nature partakers he wasn't always there but it came being born of the incorruptible seed which is a Word of God that liveth and abideth forever we're talking about the anointed inspired Word that lives and this headstone is also a living word he goes on to say the stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them was stumble at the word we're not talking about doctrine we're talking about the word knife slash what are people stumbling at they're stumbling out of God sent a prophet he had thus saith the Lord like Paul he laid a plumb line he could say any revelation he was talking about the seals he was talking about the Bible he said any revelation that's contrary to this revelation is Antichrist he said I'm not telling you my thoughts about this he said this is what he told me he said I'm just telling you what he told me to tell you not doing any different than isaiah jeremiah throat your mind prison that prophet came to asia throwed him in prison Jeremiah come before handing out slapped him in the face or Micah slapped him in the face he's a word the Spirit of God going it left me brother Brad said where at least he had that much discernment no he didn't have the spirit what are they gonna do today same thing they rejected the fulfillment of prophecy now jesus said no man knows the father but the son and no man knows the son but the father and to whom that he reveals himself over in isaiah i read to who has believed our report so the report is a message the report is the Word of God and if you go down and read it's pertaining to the coming of Christ man Asaro rejected what he's done but he's talking about Christ he said who's believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and that word the arm of the Lord means the power of God it doesn't mean his arm like rope down there on days of Babylon but who is the power of God revealed to and the only way it can be revealed as you have to believe the word in other words brother Ram said if you believe the report then the power of God has been revealed to believe this message because he said what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is and while we was groping in darkness in a denominational age he said the great resurrection came to you and I in the manifestation of the promise of God prophecy being fulfilled and to whom has believed our report then that the arm of the Lord the power of God is revealed to fulfill his word we're not talking about praying for the sick raising the dead we're talking about prophecy [Applause] but he reveals himself to whomsoever he will and him that believes me and loves me second Thessalonians what it said because they had not received the love of the truth you know what that word you read it and he amplified and says they didn't they didn't welcome the word they didn't welcome the truth they didn't ask it into its house they didn't entertain it they rejected it and because they had not the love of the truth he'll send them a strong delusion witchcraft he said how can the people be we went bewitched because they've rejected the word to reject the word and so open yourself to him bewitchment an imagination that man talks about fantasy he is living in a fantasy of darkness [Applause] speaking blasphemous things against God like that woman talking to brother Brennan said I wouldn't give in my room I wouldn't give that religion to my account and then she laid 9 send by the Browns in brother Brown when he got there she was dead and the husband said pray for pray for he said well I can't pray for her now she's gone now Saints bold he'll put it on the television he'll put it in the papers like he knows what he's doing but I'll take the Word of God the headstone prophecy being fulfilled now prophecy you and I we we our character we we our character our conduct is based upon our character because the character is what we are they call it the personification what we are in our characters what we are bad man does bad things good man does good things you don't expect too many good things out of a bad man bad character and so out of care here comes conduct and conduct is the action or the manifestation of what we are in the way that we live you know I've been in gas stations on on trips sometimes and and I'll see a woman step out and she'll have long hair and the dress and you say hey it might be on the message and then here comes her husband he's got these little shorts on you know long hair he's like no I don't guess he is killed or he'll come out he said man he looked kind of clean and everything I wonder if their message and here she comes with her panties they know what are you going by you're not talking about how nice their and how cruel they are but you're looking at the way that they express themselves and the way that they dress and present themselves and God is concerned about that we're not Baptists well you know just in my heart you know God knows my heart listen he knew Judas his heart he knew Cain's heart you know I've heard people they don't do something and it's wrong and they'll say well God knows my heart well sure he does the word tells me that but do you know because the heart is the most deceiving and your own heart can deceive you well how do you know what's in your heart by the word the word is a discerner do you love Jesus oh yes I love Jesus what do you obey His commandments well you get it wrong I don't lie don't cheat don't steal I don't have any idol no his word his voice the Lord shall descend with a shout that was his commandment for this done and as many as love me will obey my Commandments and to him who obeys my commandment my father loves and I love and he will manifest himself to me [Applause] so now we find it's manifested word st. John 17 we've really gotten behind her say 17 verse 2 as thou has given them power over all flesh that he should get talking about Christ that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal this is the characteristics of eternal life this is what eternal life is this is eternal life in other words this is the characteristics of eternal life and eternal life is what it's God's own life and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent so then if I have eternal life it reveals to me God in his Vail not what he was 2,000 years ago hang on a calvary but who he is today the holy ghost veiled in human vessels prophecy being fulfilled and this is eternal life he said how do you know you have the Holy Ghost he said because you receive the word of the hour that's the evidence so like we were saying last night you know we can here's the important thing here to me is whether the birth lays we find that under brother Brandon's ministry there was people that had the Holy Ghost and didn't know they had to hold a ghost so if you have the Holy Ghost and you don't have the whole and you don't know that you have the Holy Ghost that can be detrimental to you because here you are seeking for something that you already have so you actually open yourself if you don't watch out you open yourself to a false doctrine but at the same time you don't want to stop short of being born-again by being a Baptist and say when I believe I got it you say that's more confusing listen when I was trying to find out if I had the Holy Ghost I studied everything I read the Holy Ghost series I read everything he had to say about the Holy Ghost and the more I read the more confused I got you know what because I was looking for something tangible but what I found out was that the new birth for you knowing that you have the new birth that is a birth within itself and there's birth pains the only way that you can find out is in the word you know there's one place in the Bible that tells you how to know if you got the Holy Ghost you don't even have to ask him but you all you got to do is open your Bible to read it it's first John 5 he said I have written this that you might know you have eternal life now I've got it written I can turn to it anytime have I got eternal life and if you got eternal life you're born again you got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost what's it gonna do it's gonna lead you into truth so we've got it written right here but they want to go to something if I got to Holy Ghost you speaking to did you shout you believe the Prophet you believe the message it has to be a revelation personally reveal to you by the Holy Spirit not some man sitting on a couch saying he your seed thus saith the Lord that's nothing that's nothing it's when you read it in the message and you find your identity without this message you cannot discern whether you have the Holy Ghost or not because the Holy Spirit said it's the receive the message of your hour it's not to join a denomination a group or a following because that's what the word said and he reveals himself to whom that he will and that lays in his control now we was reading last night let's go to Psalms and we'll just go with find a stop in place we still got tomorrow I want to bring something else to kind of cap this off let's go to Psalms 36 I think brother brother lush quoted this a referred to it last night Psalms 36 and I want to read verse 9 now last night we read send thy light and thy truth that it might lead me to thy Tabernacles in other words send the light and we were talking about prophecy and the truth but it might lead me and guide me to thy thanks work that's for the presence of God but now let's look at this let's go a little step further here in Psalms 36 and verse 9 for with thee is the fountain of life now remember the scripture said they had done two evils that here to themselves cisterns and they had left the fountain of life the Living Waters so the fountain of life is the Spirit of God that's revealing himself because that's where eternal life is you're saved by grace through faith so grace tells me why I was saved my election by the foreknowledge of God now the foreknowledge of God is not looking down through the tunnel of time and seeing you being born and you as a good person or a bad person and then one day you came to the altar and you repented and then you you came to the message and then you you believe the message was the Word of God and God said I'm gonna predestinate that person because that's predestinated based upon your actions or reactions but predestination lies within the sovereignty of God so we are predestinated through the foreknowledge of God and what is the foreknowledge of God that he had so many children and he knew when those children came forth they was in the book of life he knew the body he knew the name any of the parents near the country he knew the day he knew the hour he knew the year he knew the minute he knew the second and it's like a man said one time a preacher and he was talking and he said you know say if my son got thrown into jail and they called me down there and said now we're gonna turn him over into your custody well you promised us that he won't do anything bad he said well he said I can I can place him on curfew and I and I can do all these things and restrictions and I can do everything I can do but he said I can't promise you won't do anything bad but he said now if I could put my spirit in him then I could tell you what he would do so God known that the seed was his child and when it came into that into that person that soul that gene that comes from God he predestinated predestinated what by his foreknowledge knowing there was a seed he predestinated an event that take place in that person's life that the light would strike the scene he didn't have to predestinate the seed it was already part of him he predestinated an event because he knew that when the light struck that seed and when it come to life he knew the kind of life that was in there so he predestinated us by his foreknowledge we didn't become sons at the new birth we already were sons how did you get the Holy Ghost by predestination because you had predestinated to an inheritance henkle in Galatians that said he sent his spirit into you because y-you were sons so he was quickening the seed that was in you take the seed that sweet it's crying for life lay it in there that woman he predestinated the light to strike the scene Cornelius he predestinated the light to strike the seed how did you come through predestination but it was a free choice but he only let the light strike the seed and the seed took control of your life [Applause] verse nine songs 36 for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light in thy light shall we see light Wow in thy light that belongs to him we shall see light light that's set on the earth prophecy light in thy light under thy inspiration he reveals to whom he will under his light will recognize that light as him but we must be in his life to see light in thy light will see light now what we're speaking of tonight didn't sound like it but prophecy influences your character I'm talking about prophecy revealed Daniel he was a prophet and God showed him a lot of things but there was some he had to read this in Jeremiah why that they were in in captivity evidently even though that he was a young man he must not have known he must even though his whole life was devoted to God and he had purposed in his heart not to be defiled but yet there was lacking a revelation in his life of why they were in captivity even though he was a prophet because when he read the Book of Jeremiah he read the same book we read he saw how that how that Jerusalem was condemned by God he saw exactly why that they were sent to Babylon he read it and then he realized that there was 70 years there was only two years left prophecy being revealed to Daniel by the Spirit reading the word what did it do to his life it affected his actions he went into sack cloth and ashes and began to repent prophecy revealed has an effect upon your character and character has an effect upon conduct now let's look at preeminence for a minute in clauses that he might have the preeminence so brother Brennan said the three-fold mystery one God revealing himself in Christ - he wanted to find a people that he could have the preeminence in so now we thank preeminence all I want I want him to have the preeminence in my life I'm just gonna read that Bible and fill my mind with his word when I get up in the morning the first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna think about Jesus so sure enough I get up in the morning I stretched and I look and I say the sun's out oh Jesus Jesus I want to think about Jesus you know and after a while it because it happened you wake up and you say Jesus Jesus is one what we got for breakfast Jesus in other words we're trying to make him the preeminent thing when I go to work I'm gonna keep my mind on him and I'm doing some wiring and I'm working with 220 and I get to work instead of every careful ready Jesus Jesus I gotta think about Jesus preeminence but now let me say this that prophecy revealed has an effect upon character and character has an effect upon conduct and also we find that prophecy revealed brings the preeminence of the word in your life Joe was a prophet he received a revelation that revelation was prophecy that there was coming a lamb but when it was revealed to him it was a blood sacrifice and so it changed his life we know he went to church brother Brown said his comforters they were deacon so we just say he went to church and they were believers in that day but they he was living a little bit above the revelation at one time he was with them and church theology the revelation I think we talked about this last time was that when you commit sin God judges sin and that was true God judges sin so when they came his comforters and they came to sit down with him now they came with the discernment of the wisdom of their theology and they said you know what we're under the hand of judgments of God because look at all this taking place this is this is certainly the hand of God it's just not coincidence and we know that God judges sin and so they said what have you done wrong because I know they're there investigating this thing heard me learning you committed adultery know you've been out smoking no so he went through a whole list you know and I said hmm can't find anything but we know it involves sin so it's a secret sin confess it Joe looked around he's seen a lot of things he doesn't wrong but he looked over there at that at the ashes and he knew that those ashes said that he was innocent before God and so he looked back and he said I'm innocent no sin and so then they judged him and LU comes along and he says I'm surprised you couldn't find anything wrong with him unless you and yet you condemn him because that's as far as they could go but watch there was still something lacking in jobs life because he had this revelation which was actually prophecy but now he's sitting in the middle of the ashes why do I find him in ashes because that's where he offered his sacrifice it was the ashes of his sacrifice that I believe that he was sitting in I don't believe he got in fireplace I don't believe he pushed the cooking stove aside and got in that but the ashes of his sacrifice trying to find the presence of God and he was scraping the boils skin cancer whatever it was leprosy killing him and he was looking death right in the face now he knew that his sins were forgiven but he did not his capstone revelation to seal that would be what happens after a man dies I see the tree fall I see this little branch freak come up what happens to a man when he dies what happens when he goes in the grave and he held to that prophecy his conduct was controlled by his revelation his response to his comforters gave the word preeminence that he could say I'm innocent where'd that come from the preeminence of the revelation in his own life in reference to that sacrifice that sacrifice didn't do nothing for job because it couldn't do away with sin but it was the revelation that presented him blameless and perfect before God perfect and we're talking about prophecy preeminence and perfection and God said he was perfect he said before God blameless and perfect he was upright he was righteous but he was lacking yet a revelation I call it a capstone revelation or a completion of this revelation of redemption so while he's sitting here holding to that testimony of that prophecy a revelation comes he says all now that I had I had a steel pin and I had some stone and I could write this in stone that man forever could read this I don't want some ink to fade away or some paintings on the wall but I want to write it in strong and if I die if the skin wounds eat this flesh I'll stand in this flesh and I'll see my Redeemer and not as a stranger redeemed redeemed by the blood of the Lamb and it was revealed to him of the resurrection prophecy being revealed we go to the Exodus preconceived ideas look at the Exodus for a moment Exodus let me find Exodus chapter [Music] [Applause] 4 and look at verse 28 Exodus chapter 4 verse 28 now we know that this is prophecy that God spoke to Abraham that what happened to his seat after he passed away they'd go into captivity for 400 years and then God was going to deliver him so now we are in a dispensation change we're changing from captivity to deliverance and he also he changes his name in Exodus the sixth chapter he said by my name almighty they knew me Almighty means help schastye I as shadi I means the great breasted one and that word refers as covenant keeper and provider of that covenant he not only promised a child to Abraham and to Sarah but he protected Sarah's womb el shaddai our brother branham said he draws from his breast strength and then when it came time to have the child him being almighty el shaddai he changed their bodies to have that child he was the Covenant maker and he was the provider that covenant but he said by my name Jehovah they didn't know me and Jehovah is FULFILLER of the promise because this what he's speaking up is in relationship to the scene so now we're talking about prophecy being fulfilled now here comes Moses with Aaron with a word of the Lord to bring in the accidents or deliverance in other words them coming down there is prophecy now being fulfilled and Moses this is verse 28 of chapter 4 and Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him on all the signs which he commanded him and Moses and Aaron went together went and gathered together all the elders of the church of Israel and Aaron spake spake the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people the same signs that he did there the serpent the hand all the signs and the people believed Oh what a service he comes them and he preaches the Lord God has come to deliver you out of Israel thus saith the Prophet Abraham Isaac Jacob and the last prophet Joseph when he said thus saith the Lord when God visits you and delivers you take my bones with you and those bones laid up as a memorial of the prophecy of the word of God that when it came to pass they would be carrying those bones out of Egypt now the prophecy was being fulfilled preach the message with the vines indication and the people believed and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and he and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshiped they believed they saw the vindication of the message and they believed and they bound her heads and began to worship Jehovah God what a meeting [Applause] now is reading one commentary and I thought to hell probably was the truth now comes in preconceived revelation so they heard the prophecy they saw the miracles so he said everybody left the church and went home and started packing one because it was fixing to get out of her right oh but it didn't happen right away instead they had everything packed the next morning and here come the knock of the taskmasters how come you ain't on the job uh well I guess I better get out there now we find that Pharaoh is upset over this meeting and so he says now you've got too much time on your hands blah blah blah blah blah and so he sends a he sends a representative out he beats them and sends them out they see Moses and Aaron on the way and they just oh man they just lay it on my house gods in it now we got to work harder now we know strong we gotta go find it we gotta make it say oh oh you preachers my tailor preconceived revelation look here in verse verse 9 of of chapter 5 I call this the second meeting the second service Moses comes down from the presence of the Lord repeating the prophecy and what does it say and Moses spake so on to the children of Israel but they hearkened not they didn't listen to him they sitting in a service they thought maybe they was going to pray for him say we need some instruction some divine revelation how to get this straw and make these bricks but he didn't preach on bricks he didn't preach on strong he didn't preach and say all I'm just so sorry you're working so hard I'm gonna pray and ask God to alleviate this he just comes and he gives them prophecy and it said they wouldn't even hearken to him they wouldn't listen to the message tell us sleep want to get out of there we gotta make bricks but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish and that word anguish means actually shortness those spirit in other words they were impatient now here's a prophet of God bringing exactly what they need to get out of this but they through preconceived revelation have rejected the message now Moses himself when he comes down and these people just lay it on him and walk away you know what he does he goes to God he says lord I told you not to send me I told you I couldn't do this I know preacher and they didn't listen to me and God just sits there and he listens to them you know so now Moses just take courage I want you to keep on preaching this message for me and you know I tell you what I'm gonna I'm gonna do something for you and to give you a new robe and I'm gonna give you a new car and a bigger church he just sit there and listen to him read it and he says oh I wish you'd never sent me I told you when I was down there stood before you I couldn't do it and look at see it's exactly what I said so God let him finish when he got through crying and all the noise and screaming and sat down on the tree says okay now Moses now here's what I want you to preach to me this is message number two you think he sympathizes with us he doesn't he doesn't you know anyway that's another story so prophecy now I want you to turn to Deuteronomy 29 Deuteronomy 29 this has become kind of a special scripture to me and we're going to start at verse 2 Deuteronomy 29 and Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them you have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt on to Pharaoh and on to all his servants and unto all his land now he's called it upon them he is appealing to their eyesight he appealing to what they heard what they touched what they tasted he's appealing to their five senses he said you know what you saw back to her he's appealing to their memory do you remember what happened back there you remember you saw the church you heard the noise you seen all that you remember all these things you saw you're hurting now what is it what is he saying the great temptations or trials which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles now they were living in prophecy being fulfilled and that prophecy being fulfilled it had an effect on their spirit I'm saying because when they came across Miriam danced in the spirit up and down with the tambourine and rejoicing and praising God for the great deliverance prophecy but now God says in the scriptures in Psalms believe in Psalms 103 he said Israel didn't know my Israel didn't know the acts of God but Moses knew his ways now there's a difference in acts and ways Jesus said you do err in your heart not knowing the power of God and the scriptures now to whom is the arm of the Lord to whom is the power of God revealed to but him that has believed to report him that is inspired to that word it has an effect upon a character their conduct their response and the preeminence does the word have the preeminence now Miriam danced in the spirit but now God is saying you've seen all these things and you witness these things you were affected by them watch what he says yet the Lord has not given you a heart to perceive or understand eyes to see now he just said you remember all the things you saw but now he's saying you don't have eyes to see and you don't have a heart to understand and the Lord has not given you the Lord is not giving you your daddy gave you a heart your daddy gave you eyes but now the Lord has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day let us see them miserable blind naked wretched didn't even know it didn't have eyes to see ears to hear they were living in the prophecy they had responded to it they were affected in their spirit by that prophecy they benefited by the prophecy they were under the blessings of the prophecy their clothes in where their shoes didn't wear what he says and I have led you in the wilderness 40 years your clothes not waxing old clothes then wax old Nathan's clothes didn't wax old Moses and Joshua Caleb Miriam Aaron all of your clothes didn't wear out they all was under the blessing of the prophecy by being involved with it but yet he says I haven't given you a heart to understand to perceive to discern the arm of the Lord had not been revealed to them only to to Joshua and Caleb because he had given them a heart to believe you say how do you know that because when they came to kadish Bardia watch what he goes on to say clothes are not waxen old upon you and they and the shoe is not waxen old upon your feet you have not eaten bread neither have you drunk wine or strong drink that you might know that I am the Lord your God God was trying to unveil himself who has believed our report who believed the message who actually believed the prophecy being fulfilled but just when Caleb when it came to Katie's marnya what happened they sold out because they could not trust God because the power of God had not been revealed to them so when they came to Katie's Bardia and they come back and they said yeah well it's fruit it's just like the Lord said we saw it flowing milk and honey but I tell you what there's Giants over there and you ain't going to eat too many grapes you ain't gonna drink for year you can eat the honey because they're going to kill you next to them were grasshoppers they did not have a heart to believe or perceive or to recognize they were in prophecy so it could not affect their character they rebelled they criticized they grumbled they gripe until it accumulated to unbelief and because of because of unbelief the lack of revelation on prophecy they failed to go into God's rest prophecy revealed we can prove by the scriptures that has an effect upon your conduct and your conduct it is centered around the preeminence of Christ when Joshua and Caleb got the word had such a preeminence I said well their defenses has gone from them God has given us a lion the last call cross but they did not have the faith as it was in the cloud he wasn't a cloud it was a rocket what I said this they said that they said brother Brent said this and said that why because the corner the headstone was rejected and the arm of the Lord the power God is not revealed to them do you think that man that wrote that article that I read you out of the USA News you think he knows the power god no and been revealed to him prophecy inspired Miriam was affected by it but she never made it across Joshua and Caleb after the resurrection after the resurrection the two disciples they could not recognize prophecy being fulfilled they were walking along modern events and the light came Jesus coming he said I heard one preacher said another probably the truth he come walking up and he was smiling you know he says oh he says well what's going on what are you talking about they looked at him they saying he was smiling they said you must be a visitor in that church you must be a stranger here because you're smiling probably what's the truth you know somebody comes in the church smiling a lot of times I hear the song they're out there you love the Lord you know everybody said they'll come in they're not just old disciplines you know maybe you're arguing and fussing on the way to church and you're coming down here ready for anything these like same old message brother loves preaching the same old thing he said the problem is not with brother Lars he said the problem with you that's it like somebody volton the Bible's that same old thing that's the thing I read yesterday last year I don't read through the Bible that year I don't need to read it no more they said oh you're a stranger here he said yeah he said what what's going on he said he's that why haven't you heard they started you know we we believe Jesus was there's gonna be the seed of David and take the throne and they crucified him they killed him so he started talking to him and we talked about this last time he started unfolding the word to them unfolding order and you know by the enlightenment of the word they became the to rejoice and then he he went in there and he broke bread and it says their eyes was open and they recognized the resurrected Christ and then he goes and they gather again and then you know what he does he prays for them and says Lord open our understanding that when they screed their scriptures they will understand so we just sing this little song at home open ears of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you they had a heart to perceive perceive what prophesy that they could have a bonus to stand and face the challenge of the enemy as I said about brother lush as I said about Daniel or David they stood there and they hollered across there to those jacks because hang yourself alright they wasn't afraid they wasn't afraid to announce the challenge because it wasn't their battle it was God's battle prophecy being fulfilled David said the god of my strength send thy light like truth that will guide me and the previous song he says he's trying to figure out some way of how to sell how much did he love God and he said as a heart penance for the water Brooke now you could have said I'd cut off my right arm to be a believer you know we say that sometime I mean you want a car somebody say oh right on to have that car now you wouldn't do that but you're trying to express something of your desperation are you sincerity he said as a heart panis for their water broke then I thirst for the old God then I think he must have stopped said a Living God not just to God up there on the cloud someplace but a living God that he could interact with that was a present help in the time of trouble and he comes down and he says deep call it to the deep and he says the God of my life God was the center of his life send my light like truth and in thy light we shall see light prophecy you can try all you want to have him be preeminent in your life but without prophecy being revealed and it in return affects your conduct like that little woman said I'm not what I used to be I may not be what I ought to be but I ain't what I used to be something changed some change that man when he got that little thing out of the trash can something simple but he wanted to know that he know that he knows that he had the Holy Ghost that woman that came to brother Branham she said I just don't know if I got the Holy Ghost or not brother Brown I want the Holy Ghost he said now here was a woman that had the Holy Ghost and didn't know it he said I went back to where she was born and because of her nature and her insecurities I guess the number four and all that he said he prayed and said Lord let her speak and turn to give her something to stand on and the Pentecost said well how can you have the Holy Ghost how can somebody come in the house you not know they're living in there and I heard a man one time say well if you come up and ask me if you got the Holy Ghost he said I know one thing's for sure you ain't God well that's funny that's not what a prophet said to true three people sister Sheppard enough in the blasphemous names and that porn that rock she'd fell asleep and had that dream crying because you didn't know if she had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost it's important that you know that it's important that you know your sins are forgiven these things are important but they come by divine revelation not academically but it enters into the mind academically but God inspires that and gives you a heart to perceive open the eyes of my heart Lord that I might see you and at the arm of the Lord is revealed who has believed our report in that lovely obeys my commandment he that hears the voice of the angel and recognizes him to be the Archangel or Malakai for the profit of God the fulfillment of prophecy and while we were groping in darkness the great resurrection came in the promise word made manifest prophecy and many people are affected by it but there's the people that God is opening their hearts and perception you can never Christ can never be preeminent in your life as a law abiders the legalism no matter how much I got to thinking you know the closer our relationship with God then the more revelation we have he said I won't call you servant I'll call you friend because I haven't kept anything from you so now relationship has to do with the amount of revelation that he releases to us and then comes the bride so brother Brennan says you have need of Revelation more than anything so people go look deep teachers and things like that when you come up and you raise your hand you say I want a closer walk with here but that's your spirit saying that but you know what your soul is crying out for revelation not information revelation faith and so the Spirit interprets it and says I want a closer walk what closer relationship more revelation how are you dissing clothes I could probably cold it Christ's mystery God revealed why do you hunger why do you hunger church party a thirst you want more God tonight you want to be closer to God usually we're looking at our behavior and and and what we want to be in what we aren't so we I just oh I just need more of you Lord I want to walk closer to you I need more of the Holy Spirit I want to hold it what is it you're thirsting and you're hungry for God he's the man he's the Living bread he is the embodiment of everything that we have need of for eternal life in him is Calvary in him as a Holy Spirit amen in him as a glorified body in him as a resurrection everything that we have need of for the rapture is in that manner he is a living matter he is a word to come to you he is that's calling on me pause that's crew and the Lord shall be sin with a shout it wasn't the whole book it was a brides message to call a bride what bothers agree what powers of denominations what power has a world and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it you know usually when you think about that you think busting into a fortress but that ain't it they had Sansom locked into that city and the gates of Hell cannot prevail he took them any put him on his shoulders and the gates of hell sin could not hold you it could not bind you but you are they quickened and made alive and giving you our hearts and proceeded many are affected by this message but what happens when they come to cater smart ear they did not have a heart to perceive they were under the blessings they could see what the effect of the message did to the Egyptians they can see the prayer lines they can see it all this cloud but this goes beyond the cloud it goes beyond doctrine it's eternal life touching eternal life [Applause] and when they came to Cadiz marnya the word had preeminence when it came to the comforters it had preeminence when it comes in this in time it'll have a preeminence that's why Satan is trying to neutralize and disarm the revelation of prophecy he knows that doctrine has no power without the revelation of prophecy the resurrection the quickening power came to us in the manifestation of the promised word as it did in the days of the Exodus but people that wasn't a message or preconceived ideas of what it ought to be when they wouldn't even listen after hot even though that God inspired the preacher and he come and poured his heart out he wouldn't listen to him I need more faith hot out he's gonna preach on heal and I got cancer I was looking for a real good faith message so I get healed listen you can be healing cancer he's still got to get out of here [Applause] he said you think cancer is ugly he said you ought to see a soul but that's eating up my see I've seen gruesome pictures of cancer and leprosy he sends a soul you'll never see it in the microscope I've seen it today in killing their wives killing the children killing their buddies killing this killing that killing themselves you don't know that that ain't a devil it's worse than cancer it's cruel this heartless it's selfish a drunk driving down the road you talk about selfish kills an innocent family the epitome of selfishness self love self love in the church self love in the world self will people's rights I got my rights to do this and I got my rights to do that if I wasn't they don't want to marry that man I got my rights you got your rights why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you so what you're feeling here is actually what God is doing in his great symphony he's actually doing here - called you to do something here why do you hunger why do you thirst oh I'll go to church this morning whose freakin brother wash Oh Harvard well hey you know brother Mike's gonna be there oh well let's go see him yeah and that's fine but James said when you have respective persons there's sin involved if not because now you're only looking at the temp all you're doing is looking at the veil but you never been behind the veil and after the while the voice of the high priest becomes the voice of the veil to you now you know he's not the pillar fire but the pillar fires back turn you've never seen him and and then you look at the veil you say you know I know that veil is not the pillar fire but this is as close as I've ever got to it and so then that veil becomes a pillar fire but a person's has been behind there and in the presence of the pillar of fire that voice will never be the voice of the pillar fire and that veil will never be that pillar fire because he's done had that experience don't tell me you can't get the Holy Ghost my man preach says you can't get the Holy Ghost Hill brother branham comes back I'll tell you one thing he does not have the Holy Ghost because that's why he's telling you you can't get it oh you ain't sanctified anybody preach that to you auntie exactly where they're living they've never been sanctified do you think a man that's been justified would preach that you ain't justified he would preach the word that you'd come to the same position that he is but he said what are they do they stand in the door they won't go in and they won't let you go in [Applause] the God knows how to take care of lines you're gonna get there and blindness on nobody well you know because of my wife this is an individual affair and we say that and we like to say it to the church sometimes into the pastor well this is an individual affair he's not speaking to a group he's speaking than an individual well you brought yourself to your own indictment you won't be able to blame it on nobody else either you'll have to take the responsibility on yourself there's nobody gonna stand be front of that throne and blame it on anybody else because he's giving you as a free moral agent to make your own choice I read a book one time and a man said they can take away your freedom they can put you in prison they can treat you cruel they can take your clothes but one thing they cannot take from you and that's your response [Applause] you can respond to cruelty with love and care and concern he was in one of those prisons over there whole in Germany and there is this one one this one guard and he was a cruel German all cruel he everybody hated him oh they just wish they'd have some way to kill him and strangle him from beaten to death but this man he just treated him he just talked college home because that man is possessed with a devil and one day this man comes to him and he's got family problems he's had a little kind of a fuss with his wife and I guess maybe threatened Italy and he comes to this prisoner and he looks for counsel and comfort you have the right to respond in a free moral agency to choose how you respond but you let so many things get it out of you you let you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsty you're thirsty and hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you see the revelation the last day is here prophecy prophecy but in his light we see light and he strengthened who's man when that angel came to Daniel he said he put strengthened me jobs at all if I knew where he was I'd knock on his door and he's not going to condemn me but he's going to put strength in me all if you could find them opening eyes of my heart Lord and I might see thee as we bow our heads Heavenly Father God may you open the eyes of our hearts Lord is that man that you prayed for in the days of your flesh a blind man and you prayed for him and he said what do you see now is it well he said I see Mena's trees he said let me pray for you again bored sometimes we need our eyes fully opened that we can see clearly this day this prophecy Bart not just to see if hence what a prophet did in the pear line Lord but to look beyond that because we're part of your great symphony or just in that dynamic somewhere and Lord it's affected us not just in our spirit but down in our soul who open the eyes of our heart Lord as you did to those on the roads on this as you did to those it was gathered together in that little room and you spoke to them the things that you had already spoke to them but now it was in season and you were opening up the eyes of their heart Oh God may we not quench the thirst that sent us with the things of the world may we not listen to our human spirit the Lord may we discern the very desires of the soul and that it's you are sweetheart our lover that we longed for not Satan's civilization not these things that will lead us into darkness and corruption not these things that are fayliss but Lord don't let us be so spiritual that we're of no earthly good you sat down with them you went and talked to the woman at the well you taken time with your people and Lord you still take time with your people Lord may you come Lord give us a heart to proceed Lord we see put Oh God let us see give us eyes that our mother and father's not giving us with word glasses and hearing aids and false teeth and toupees and but all God Lord you never change you're always there and I believe as David he stood there I think of Peter and hey denied you and Kirsten denying it oh how I felt you couldn't even go back to church couldn't face a church when all by himself all he just himself until our guilty and I was shamed and I'm bad he felt oh god how bad David felt killing a man covers on sin and lust and how that love in his heart for you condemned him Lord that he realized you showed him a picture of himself not realizing it was him a man had taken another man sheep and killed it to feed his guests while he had under the and he said kill the man said David you're the man oh he must have felt in the presence of that prophet it is hard and failed God how that woman at the well must have felt but only a savior could love me and he said not Mary I want you to go tell my disciples oh yes make sure make sure that you go and tell Peter because I want to see him he wants to see I don't care how dark it might seem those things that you hid injure your heart God no there but he's provided around them for you if you'll come to him and accept him and repent well he still loves you and he's died for you and he's purchased your freedom for you not to be bound by darkness and fear intimidation but the liberty of the Holy Spirit the truth and life not to be bound by the news and evil circumstances and stock markets and what gas is gonna be tomorrow on how much pres is gonna cost but that he might have the preeminence through the revelation God opened the eyes of our heart more completely tonight Lord we accept the prayer that you prayed in that day God let us when we read this message when we read our Bibles when we listen to the tapes when we come to church or listen to one another open our ears that we might hear in our eyes that we might see not the ones that our father gave us but the ones that my Heavenly Father has given me when he birthed me all they've rejected you but to you to us your beautiful stone your precious stone your beautiful branch but the vehm its paranoid to them it's heresy it's fantasy its disillusionment but we see the trap of the enemy closing in upon the world Oh God we're in our last Exodus for the Gentiles may you use this Lord to help another Lord in life's dream let our footsteps Lord may it be footsteps in the sands of time that if we would pass that others would look at the footprints look at our footprint and alive and take courage and move ahead let us not be dumb driven cattle but Lord let us be willful champions in this night Lord let us by the spirit not in our own strength Satan prepare to defend yourself because the battle is not now it's God's then Lord our eyes are upon you and we wait upon you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen brother love should be coming and then thank God for the word praying that it's a personal challenge from him to you that we might know him as a father our Father but that we might know him as our brother in Christ they mean he is our father because we are his sons and his daughters but he came down in the form of a son to identify with us as brothers and sisters that the relationship become more and more intimate [Music] and part your is life in you as you be borned again by the grace of God Amen let's stand and sing Lord I'm coming now to the lay thy nail-scarred and on me let the healing virtue flow when I shall being made whole this believe the word but not with our heads let's believe it in our hearts the prophet of God said why are people so tossed about [Applause] spiritually he says because he said it's more intellectual than spiritual to become established in the truth is receive the Holy Ghost into soul but in your flesh not in your human spirit but in your soul that makes some spiritual there are too many that are just religious [Applause] they've experienced God in their flesh then experience God in their human spirit but have you experienced God in your soul [Music] you know him as father do you know I mean Christ as your brother in Christ that's right by the grace of God he come down this is in that day the power God said that's this day he says you'll know that I'm in the father the father in me and I in you Anu and me it's a revelation in the soul this is faith not just knowledge faith I know it it's more real to me than what my senses declare what date reveals what God reveals through faith is more real to me than what my census is telling me god help us it's serious it is serious let's not take it for granted we should believe it with our hearts with me with our souls let's give our lives to him this live for Jesus whether it's at home my work in school in university live for Jesus your Jesus the promise that he has poured himself into the church dr. church becomes the Omega Christ in flesh my god forgive us for he's not I believe this that I believe that because like we said the devil believes it too and now with that he believes it more than a lot of but also called bully and you know what and I've said if I repeated it and it give him pay to give him this faith and he knows his time is short he saw what God had stand did and God God has done and what God is doing and he knows oh my our time is short what do we know these are as real to us as it is to the devil our brother mentioned it too many believe this believe this worship worship worship and not know that they're worshipping the devil because it's in their flesh and in their head but not in the heart Gaza quarters is the heart God's control towers your heart The Devil's ish is your hint and the senses of your body let's have a faith that pleases God so that were not tossed about by the grace of God that what we do what we live is the expression of our faith hey man it is the revelation of Jesus Christ in you [Applause] not representing bible-believers association not representing the house of God assembly what church do you belong to how many of us are going to you say as that brother out in western Newfoundland said when he went into the hospital what church do you belong to they'll ask you that when you go into a hospital so they'll know what pastor to call always say what church decide belong to the Church of the first Moore she said what he said the Church of the firstborn I've never heard of that she said well he said the Bible says we're part where we belong to the Church of the firstborn written in heaven and the pasture that she would have the call would be Jesus call chases on the scene they pray God we're all members of the Church of the firstborn don't identify with this whether it's just this assembly here or our brothers sisters here from the Estonian central Newfoundland don't identify with that you're identifying with the Church of the firstborn written in heaven it is the word it is right here it is right here may mean and the pastor ministered to us tonight oh no no no that brother Mike no no no Jesus look beyond Jesus look beyond when it ran to see Jesus the Lord descending from heaven with a shout the Lord to reveal what John was forbidden to right [Music] they meant to reveal what was not revealed Eleuthera Wesley or the Pentecostals you've got a tremendous responsibility God's requiring more of us than he has of any other age god help us is my prayer make your calling and election sure make sure you're you are the Church of the firstborn
