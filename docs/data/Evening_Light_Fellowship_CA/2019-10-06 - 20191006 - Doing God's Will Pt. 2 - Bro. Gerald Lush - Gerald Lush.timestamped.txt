[41:26] heart of God man
[41:29] all of us
[41:33] yes a man yes
[41:38] [Music]
[41:43] praise the name of the Lord amen grace
[41:47] of God to us as we go from the singing
[41:51] to the hearing a man the tongue would
[41:54] say one thing but very we pray it's
[41:57] going to hear the word of God praise the
[41:59] name of the Lord
[42:00] so to God be the glory as we go into his
[42:04] words a man that we're going to say what
[42:07] God wants us to say you're going to hear
[42:09] it what God wants you to hear amen
[42:12] not what you want to hear how you want
[42:14] to hear it when and where but it's what
[42:16] God wants us to hear amen and it says
[42:20] thy word have I hid in my heart a man so
[42:23] we got we got to have the word in US
[42:25] with us and around us but it's so
[42:28] significant so important and again when
[42:31] we say word we're not just we're not
[42:33] referring to this this no no in the
[42:36] beginning was the word and the Word was
[42:38] with God and the Word was God and the
[42:41] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[42:43] so brother we want this in flesh in the
[42:47] flesh of Jesus and now in the flesh of
[42:49] his bride in the flesh of flesh of his
[42:51] sons and daughters a man those who are
[42:54] in the revelation those who are
[42:57] reflecting the revelation and those who
[43:00] are in the will of God a man well they
[43:03] were in the revelation reflecting of the
[43:05] way God wants it done were in the will
[43:06] of God
[43:07] so god help us brother that we're going
[43:10] to be in his will and do him a service
[43:13] with his will not country to his will or
[43:17] without it and there's many down through
[43:19] the ages brother they've tried to serve
[43:21] God but not according to his will
[43:22] they tried to serve God according to
[43:24] their will what they want how they want
[43:26] it when and where they wanted no no not
[43:28] my real father
[43:29] thine be done amen we show you the
[43:32] significance of the will of God amen
[43:35] Jesus I lighted the significance of the
[43:37] will of God so brother so I pray the
[43:40] grace of God that we're going to
[43:41] recognize the significance of of being
[43:43] in the will of God a man praise the name
[43:46] of the Lord
[43:47] it's just now saying I believe this and
[43:49] I believe that I'm in the message are we
[43:52] in the will of God or the will of God is
[43:54] the message
[43:54] right but again when it comes to God
[43:57] applying that message to your life
[43:59] applying it to my life somebody else is
[44:01] like brother what God is going to do and
[44:03] use one thing but he doesn't somebody
[44:04] else is another what God uses you for
[44:07] one thing what he uses somebody else is
[44:09] another a man we got to have that
[44:11] leadership and that anointing in our
[44:13] lives by the grace of God amen
[44:16] so being prayer as we go more and more
[44:18] into the word concerning I have heard
[44:22] but now I see I've got a right motive
[44:25] and right objective and doing God a
[44:27] service with his will not without his
[44:30] will a man I was surprised to discover
[44:33] that in the first message that we were
[44:35] considering
[44:36] I have heard but now I see that the
[44:38] problem of God highlights the will of
[44:40] God two or three times a man so I want
[44:43] to show you with you scriptures
[44:44] concerning the will of God and to share
[44:47] with you some thoughts through the
[44:48] messenger and the messenger of the hour
[44:50] concerning the will of God a man brother
[44:54] to those that are acceptable in God's
[44:56] presence in sight brother we got to be
[44:59] in the will of God amen
[45:01] because if not God's going to challenge
[45:03] us as a challenge game if thou do as
[45:06] well what they'll also be accepted amen
[45:08] but to do well do you have to do it
[45:10] according to the will of God amen by the
[45:13] grace of God amen
[45:16] so just to remind you that there is a
[45:20] couple of sheets of some quotes the Lord
[45:23] laid on my heart and there be copies out
[45:26] there for you and it's referencing God's
[45:28] love gift to our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[45:33] so you can pick that up on your way out
[45:35] so basically we wonder what is God's
[45:39] love gift to our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[45:42] I trust you can identify with what the
[45:44] Prophet is revealing a man you can say
[45:47] Amen brother branham I believe it by the
[45:50] grace of God amen let's stay in this
[45:52] thing only believe all things are
[45:54] possible only believe alleluia
[45:57] Oh baby
[46:01] Oh
[46:07] all things are possible

[53:21] believe amen
[53:26] embrace the name of the Lord god bless
[53:29] you turn with me to st. Luke's Gospel
[53:34] you see no I'm sorry
[53:38] it's st. Matthew chapter 6 it's in
[53:46] Matthew's Gospel chapter 6 the grace of
[53:52] God to us as we go into the word hey man
[53:56] take it serious
[53:58] the our living is serious brothers
[54:01] sister so much so that Jesus said if he
[54:04] didn't shorten time there be no flesh
[54:05] saved but thank God for the elects sake
[54:08] he shortens time a man we know that it's
[54:12] just almost six thousand years in the
[54:15] Jewish calendar we know we've gone over
[54:17] in the Roman one but that's not that
[54:19] better that calendar is not correct so
[54:22] we're gonna stick to the Jewish calendar
[54:23] and and recognize what God is doing with
[54:26] us and recognize what God is doing with
[54:28] them a man because they are also a sign
[54:31] a man to us by the grace of God and in
[54:36] Matthew chapter 6 and verse 7 but he
[54:50] said when ye pray use not vain
[54:53] repetitions as the heathen do for they
[54:58] think that they shall be heard for their
[55:01] much speaking not of leavers like that
[55:07] but it says be not ye therefore like
[55:10] unto them for your father knoweth what
[55:14] things ye have need of before you ask
[55:17] him after this manner therefore pray
[55:24] notice the instructions that he gives in
[55:27] the Lord's Prayer our Father which art
[55:34] in heaven hallowed be thy name is
[55:38] recognizing our father and his name amen
[55:43] thy kingdom come notice the kingdom come
[55:49] Thy will be done
[55:51] amen the will of God be done in earth as
[55:57] it is in heaven amen
[56:00] no wonder said not my will then be done
[56:03] it's not what I will is what God wills a
[56:06] man is what God has predestinated from
[56:10] the foundation of the world
[56:12] a man we wonder as it is the will of God
[56:15] in heaven we want that will of God on
[56:18] earth a man in his sons and daughters in
[56:21] Israel and in the Gentile bright so thy
[56:28] kingdom come they will be done in earth
[56:32] is his will in you is his will in me as
[56:37] it is in heaven
[56:40] this is tremendous because what God
[56:43] purposed in heaven God is making flesh
[56:46] on the earth praise the Lord so give us
[56:50] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[56:55] our debts as we forgive our debtors amen
[57:02] that's having the right spirit in this
[57:04] world for sure
[57:05] amen and lead us not into temptation but
[57:10] deliver us from evil again reminding you
[57:19] of the time when I was working at a
[57:21] house on a ladder inside and this
[57:26] gentleman came in and he looked at me
[57:31] and he said Jarrell I got a Bible
[57:33] question I said okay I'll see what the
[57:38] Lord will
[57:38] me and he referenced the Lord's Prayer
[57:42] and he said it says lead us not into
[57:47] temptation but deliver us from evil
[57:50] he said why would we say that does God
[57:55] tempt us does God delivered but bring us
[57:58] into temptation and does God bring us
[58:00] into evil I should know I said you're
[58:04] asking God and praying God to deliver us
[58:07] from the influence of the tempter that's
[58:09] the devil a man to deliver us from the
[58:12] influence of Satan a man so I said lead
[58:16] us not into temptation
[58:17] taking away Shane's influence from your
[58:20] life a man from your soul and deliver us
[58:24] from evil a man deliver us from the
[58:28] influence of the devil
[58:29] amen all he said brother oh that's
[58:33] wonderful
[58:33] he said that makes a lot of sense he was
[58:36] I was wondering about God and what God
[58:38] was like and and how a leader we would
[58:41] do this now I would do that thank you
[58:43] brother he said I'll never forget it
[58:45] of course he I trust my grace he's
[58:46] wrestling with the Lord he's gone on for
[58:48] a number of years now a man so lead us
[58:52] not into temptation but deliver us from
[58:54] evil deliver us from Satan's influence a
[58:57] man not just this deed or that deed is
[59:00] the one that's causing that and that is
[59:03] the devil a man trying to re understand
[59:07] that when you read the Lord's Prayer or
[59:09] when you say the Lord's Prayer again for
[59:12] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[59:15] the glory forever amen god bless his
[59:20] words you may be seated
[59:27] we're going to some other scriptures in
[59:30] a moment but these are notes that
[59:37] brother and brother Matthew I believe
[59:39] used on Wednesday when he when I was
[59:41] gone and he was talking I believe about
[59:44] sacrifices and there was a section there
[59:48] saying things to sacrifice and it says
[59:53] invent Peter he says he also as lively
[59:57] stones are built up a spiritual house an
[59:59] holy priesthood a man to offer up
[1:00:04] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:00:08] by Jesus Christ so is not looking at the
[1:00:12] physical sacrifice but the spiritual we
[1:00:14] can sacrifice that spirit physically and
[1:00:17] we can do this physically a man as the
[1:00:20] Bible says you you can leave and lay
[1:00:21] down your life you can know this and
[1:00:23] know that but you're not going to make
[1:00:25] spiritual sacrifices then it's all in
[1:00:28] vain yeah it is absolutely tremendous
[1:00:31] when it comes to Corinthians first
[1:00:34] Corinthians chapter 13 Paul was
[1:00:37] encouraging you know the believers to
[1:00:39] understand this to do this to do this to
[1:00:41] do that and so on but then he comes down
[1:00:44] with this with this warning concerning
[1:00:47] that the gifts must be governed by love
[1:00:50] amen and again there's no matter what
[1:00:53] you do for God it's got to be governed
[1:00:55] by love a man it's the love of God in
[1:00:58] you the love of God in me now brother is
[1:01:01] the love of God in me going back to God
[1:01:03] a man responding to his word so all the
[1:01:07] revelation all that God has given us the
[1:01:09] the faith to do it's got to be it's got
[1:01:12] to be governed by divine love not
[1:01:16] natural off it's got to be difficult
[1:01:18] governed by divine law God have mercy on
[1:01:21] us and God help us that we're not just
[1:01:23] putting the emphasis on the letter of
[1:01:24] the word but we're going to put the
[1:01:25] emphasis on the spirit of the word a man
[1:01:27] because it's the spirit of the word
[1:01:30] that's life not the letter the letter
[1:01:32] are killed but the Spirit is going to
[1:01:34] give us eternal life by the grace of God
[1:01:36] a man as if if if it's governed by
[1:01:40] divine love that I've had that
[1:01:42] experience with God I bet a that
[1:01:44] experience with Jesus to the extent any
[1:01:46] man that I have is loving me
[1:01:49] and it's not me it's Christ to live
[1:01:50] within me a mayor and brother I gotta
[1:01:53] have Christ in me to have the love of
[1:01:54] Christ
[1:01:55] I gotta have Christ in me do to reflect
[1:01:57] the love of Christ amen to manifest the
[1:02:00] love of Christ pour em and for one
[1:02:03] another so brother I pray the grace of
[1:02:06] God help us that we're going to love one
[1:02:09] another as we love him we're going to
[1:02:11] love one another as the evidence that we
[1:02:13] love him that's it brother sister there
[1:02:16] are those that say they love God but
[1:02:17] they don't love their brothers and
[1:02:18] sisters in Christ a man they looked down
[1:02:21] their noses and this one day instead of
[1:02:23] respecting them and then God says listen
[1:02:26] he said they're they're weak and there's
[1:02:28] the strong there are those that are up
[1:02:29] here there are those that I down here
[1:02:31] and he's nei God God requires that the
[1:02:34] ones that are up here he's going to look
[1:02:35] after the ones that are down here a man
[1:02:38] they're going to support and encourage
[1:02:39] the ones that are that are weak they're
[1:02:42] going to support and encourage the ones
[1:02:43] they don't have the revelation maybe
[1:02:46] they they got maybe because they some
[1:02:48] got greater revelation greater
[1:02:49] revelation greater revelation but
[1:02:51] brother whether they're strong or weak
[1:02:52] they but they still have faith a man in
[1:02:56] what they see and what they know whether
[1:02:57] they were they were they understand they
[1:03:00] a gives them the faith that pleases God
[1:03:02] amen because God God requires this of
[1:03:05] one person but he's not expecting it
[1:03:06] from the other a man God's acknowledging
[1:03:09] that person and that person's nature a
[1:03:11] man of course he's there to help them
[1:03:13] but again brother he God has permitted
[1:03:16] that person to be there God has
[1:03:18] permitted the other person to be there
[1:03:19] those that are weak those that are
[1:03:21] strong amen because the weak ones are
[1:03:24] going to bring out was in the strong
[1:03:25] ones oh brother
[1:03:27] and again God's ways are not our ways
[1:03:29] and neither is his thoughts are thoughts
[1:03:31] a man because as I as the heaven is
[1:03:35] above the earth so is God's ways and
[1:03:37] God's thoughts above ours a man so
[1:03:40] brother a constantly requiring the water
[1:03:44] is reminding us that we've got we've got
[1:03:47] to humble ourselves amen brother and
[1:03:49] there's anything your experience with
[1:03:51] Jesus has done it's humbled you
[1:03:54] you're gonna give the glory to God
[1:03:55] you're gonna give the glory to Jesus
[1:03:57] you're gonna give the glory to others
[1:03:58] but you're not going to glorify yourself
[1:04:00] amen brother as the scripture says here
[1:04:03] though those that want to do this - what
[1:04:05] for to highlight themselves they want to
[1:04:07] do this and I light themselves and make
[1:04:09] you look and make themselves look good
[1:04:11] in the eyes of the others no no brother
[1:04:13] listen listen to make them sure that
[1:04:15] we're good in the eyes of God amen and
[1:04:17] if you're good in the eyes of God
[1:04:19] brother you don't consider yourself very
[1:04:21] good and yeah in your own eyes
[1:04:23] amen brother if there's anything that
[1:04:25] Hong but will humble us and anything
[1:04:27] that keeps us humble is the revelation
[1:04:29] that I am a sinner saved by grace
[1:04:32] amen and that you are a sinner saved by
[1:04:35] grace
[1:04:35] see God concluded all under sin that he
[1:04:39] might have mercy on all a man so that
[1:04:42] there's not ever going to be claim this
[1:04:44] and claim this and so on
[1:04:46] oh I'm better than this when I'm better
[1:04:47] than that we'll see what God is doing
[1:04:48] it's the grace of God ain't man and
[1:04:51] whether you're whether you're you're
[1:04:53] just a simple humble testimony of the
[1:04:57] Lord or whether you're a prophet a man
[1:04:59] prayers God's concerned your sinners
[1:05:01] saved by grace amen so brother sister
[1:05:05] help us to have the revelation that
[1:05:07] pleases God help us they have the
[1:05:09] attitude that pleases God help us that
[1:05:11] find us Lord God you'll find us in the
[1:05:14] will of God amen brother game the will
[1:05:16] of God os in the message a man o course
[1:05:19] it's in the message but whether it's in
[1:05:22] the message or in this you're doing this
[1:05:23] or you got this ministry this ministry
[1:05:26] that ministry but again we're all
[1:05:28] sinners saved by grace and so father God
[1:05:30] said even he said the pastor he said
[1:05:33] when he gets out of the pulpit he said
[1:05:35] when I get a II got at the pulpit he
[1:05:36] said I'm just another brother like you
[1:05:38] Amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:05:41] Alleluia thank God that that the power
[1:05:43] of God had such humility the prophet of
[1:05:46] God has such a revelation a man mother
[1:05:48] he didn't want to exalt himself above
[1:05:50] you not by any means he wanted to exalt
[1:05:52] Jesus he want to give Jesus the glory he
[1:05:55] wanted to get your attention to Jesus a
[1:05:57] man and he and again he referred to his
[1:06:01] ministry and the success of his ministry
[1:06:03] what have I got to do he said he says
[1:06:05] work for God to do this
[1:06:07] regard to do that and he said to refer
[1:06:09] for the anointing to be upon the sick
[1:06:11] and he saw I got I got a choice and I
[1:06:13] just stand there and and tell them this
[1:06:15] and tell them that no no no he said I
[1:06:17] got to get into their shoes amen
[1:06:20] he said because that could be my brother
[1:06:22] that could be my mother could be my
[1:06:24] father a man so he said I got to get
[1:06:26] into their shoes white girl it could be
[1:06:28] him a man and he said I'm going to
[1:06:31] identify so with their sickness praise
[1:06:33] the name of the Lord hallelujah and he
[1:06:35] was going to call on the Lord a man out
[1:06:38] of a head of a pure heart a man because
[1:06:41] his heart was going out to that brother
[1:06:43] his heart was going out to that person
[1:06:44] maybe that child ain't man Alleluia
[1:06:47] brother he wasn't there to magnify
[1:06:49] himself he wasn't there to glorify
[1:06:51] himself with this sign of that sign and
[1:06:53] this gift and that gift no brother I
[1:06:55] tell you this it was motivated by divine
[1:06:58] love though he was called to be a
[1:07:00] prophet and he was given these signs yet
[1:07:02] it was controlled and motivated by his
[1:07:04] love for God and his love for God is
[1:07:07] reflected by his love for the the sons
[1:07:10] and daughters of God a man though old
[1:07:12] mine praise the name of the Lord I tell
[1:07:15] you this there's many a preacher that
[1:07:17] had that had never had the signs and
[1:07:18] wonders that William Branham hat but
[1:07:20] brother what they did have the old they
[1:07:22] went out and pray for the sick and they
[1:07:23] were healed by the grace of God and what

[1:07:28] elevated themselves they they all mind
[1:07:30] you know they I got a great ministry I

[1:07:40] a no matter what you are as a pastor but
[1:07:43] whatever it is is it's God we're not
[1:07:45] great god is great a man it is and God
[1:07:48] maybe takes the worst so he can use it
[1:07:51] and use them this way a man oh my god is
[1:07:55] not going to go there or take somebody
[1:07:57] that's I and lift it up in their minds
[1:07:59] no he's going to take somebody else down

[1:11:15] and with what God is revealing in my day
[1:11:18] and in your day a man all God Elvis
[1:11:22] brother or I I believe the message of
[1:11:24] the Prophet and so on but again like I
[1:11:26] said so does the devil but brother the
[1:11:29] devil is not going to believe it to the
[1:11:30] extent that it's going to control him no
[1:11:33] no but what believers believe it to the
[1:11:36] extent that it controls you amen that it
[1:11:39] controls us so we're there oh this is as
[1:11:44] oh yeah I a certain certain believer was
[1:11:48] highlighting Christmas and and it was
[1:11:53] sent practically you know around the
[1:11:55] world and when I when I received this
[1:11:57] saying that they're writing and I just
[1:12:00] went to the phone right away I never
[1:12:02] waited I went to the phone right away
[1:12:04] and I dialed him and I said look do you
[1:12:06] know what you've done what do you mean I
[1:12:10] say we I said you you've I said you've
[1:12:13] all mine
[1:12:15] you've oh yea increase the sale I sell
[1:12:17] Christmas trees I said it's going to be
[1:12:19] increased increase increase increase I
[1:12:21] suggest because of what you said and how
[1:12:23] you said it
[1:12:24] I said why in the world didn't you
[1:12:26] include some quotes by the Prophet a
[1:12:28] mayor and I just say this and I just say
[1:12:30] that no no no I said but I said don't
[1:12:33] just say leave him with this impression
[1:12:35] that impression all the power of God you
[1:12:37] know he had a Christmas tree for his son
[1:12:39] Joseph yeah he say but Joseph was only a
[1:12:41] little boy then a man and only that I
[1:12:44] said hey the Christmas tree there was a
[1:12:46] wire one
[1:12:47] that he that he went out and bought in a
[1:12:49] store somewhere a man but I said you
[1:12:51] should have also included the quotes I
[1:12:53] see where the prophet of God said how in
[1:12:55] the world can you call yourself a
[1:12:56] Christian and he shouldn't have those
[1:12:58] things and he talked about the
[1:12:59] decorations in a house there you
[1:13:02] decorate your windows you decorate your
[1:13:03] your ceiling and maybe have a Christmas
[1:13:05] tree here and there so on so a brother I
[1:13:07] said don't never do that again I said
[1:13:10] the power of God and I and I put it
[1:13:12] online of course and I friend of the
[1:13:13] book I said I want to show you whether
[1:13:15] prophet of God said what he believed and
[1:13:18] what he and what he spoke concerning
[1:13:19] Christmas and so on
[1:13:21] and I said no where are we justified I
[1:13:23] sit in having a Christmas decorations
[1:13:26] nor be justified in even having a
[1:13:28] Christmas tree a man brother what is the
[1:13:31] will of God let's find the will of God
[1:13:34] in the revealed Word of God in this hour
[1:13:36] the problem might have done this but he
[1:13:38] said this so brother we're going to
[1:13:40] judge by what he said not by what he did
[1:13:43] but what he said a man from the grace of
[1:13:45] God that we're going to stay with the
[1:13:48] Word of God
[1:13:49] stay with the message of God stay with
[1:13:51] the revealed Word a man and I know that
[1:13:54] he Eve and believers can criticize and
[1:13:56] condemn me for for the for the booklet
[1:13:58] that I put out and they said all you
[1:14:01] never read that right there when the end
[1:14:03] where it speaks of it in internal Maya
[1:14:05] and so on I said brother I said we can
[1:14:08] apply it to idolatry and as we can apply
[1:14:11] through this and apply it to that but I
[1:14:12] said Christmas is idolatry amen
[1:14:15] so by the grace of God that with divine
[1:14:18] love we stay with the word with divine
[1:14:21] love we're going to we're going to
[1:14:22] become one with the word amen that we
[1:14:25] love God and if we love God we love his
[1:14:27] word we love God we love his sons and
[1:14:29] daughters if we love God we love the
[1:14:31] body of Christ a man by the grace of God
[1:14:34] so he said that in there when it comes
[1:14:36] with the gifts everything got to be
[1:14:38] governed by love amen
[1:14:40] she said oh I speak with the tongues of
[1:14:42] men and of angels and have not charity
[1:14:44] divine love I am become as sounding
[1:14:47] brass and a tinkling cymbal
[1:14:50] amen see he says he's explaining to us
[1:14:53] that it and when the prophet of God has
[1:14:55] brought out in hearing it the way God
[1:14:57] wants you to hear it see the way God
[1:14:59] wants you to see it
[1:15:00] the right motive and objective because
[1:15:02] if we don't then it's all in vain a man
[1:15:05] it is all in vain and in doing God a
[1:15:08] service without his will he said it's
[1:15:10] all in vain it is if it's not according
[1:15:13] to his will a man if your life is not
[1:15:16] according to his will if what you're
[1:15:17] doing in your life is not according to
[1:15:19] the will of God for you whether you're
[1:15:21] your spiritual if there's any spiritual
[1:15:23] there is all in vain
[1:15:25] or your religion is becoming vain Amen
[1:15:28] because if it's God if it's serving God
[1:15:32] if it's relieving God it's got to be
[1:15:34] according to his will we got to do it
[1:15:36] the way that God wants us to do it and
[1:15:38] we got to do it our God wants to do it
[1:15:41] when God wants to do it it's not a God's
[1:15:43] not leaving us to our own ideas no no
[1:15:46] he's bringing us why he brings us to the
[1:15:48] word thy word have I hid in my heart a
[1:15:51] man that I might not sin against a what
[1:15:55] is it the word because we're what
[1:15:57] everything you were coming back to the
[1:15:59] word the word is going to go into govern
[1:16:01] you the word is going to control you a
[1:16:02] man so that we're not going to be
[1:16:05] controlled and governed by by the world
[1:16:07] and the things of the world like a it
[1:16:10] was Wonder Brothers brought up to me
[1:16:11] just recently a better sermon I preached
[1:16:13] some years ago and it was called ten
[1:16:16] shekels and a shirt
[1:16:18] what yeah a Jew in the priesthood years
[1:16:25] ago a man oh there was another Jew and
[1:16:30] his mother that had this home but they
[1:16:32] had idolatry in the home oh yeah but I
[1:16:36] assume maybe his mother felt old we
[1:16:39] should have God here - you know Elohim
[1:16:42] and so on and we should we should not
[1:16:44] only you never have a priesthood for the
[1:16:46] Guardian and for idolatry we need a
[1:16:48] priesthood for God so her son went out
[1:16:51] any man he met this this rabbi and he
[1:16:54] and he said always said would you come
[1:16:56] he said and burnt and then could serve
[1:16:59] us you know anything anything worshiping
[1:17:02] God and so on and he said I'll tell you
[1:17:04] what I'll do he said I'll give you ten
[1:17:06] shekels and a shirt hey ten shekels
[1:17:09] other shirt you see if you'll come and
[1:17:10] live with me live with us amen
[1:17:13] so here I do
[1:17:14] three on one side of his house on the
[1:17:15] other side he had this displaced Jewish
[1:17:19] priesthood eight-man but he was there he
[1:17:21] was compromising brother if he wasn't
[1:17:24] compromising he will put the idol out he
[1:17:26] was if he wasn't compromising he
[1:17:27] wouldn't it went into that house until
[1:17:29] that until they put of that a man then
[1:17:31] he would - he would come in and say son
[1:17:33] all right I'll come representing the
[1:17:35] true God
[1:17:36] I'll come representing Redemption I'll
[1:17:37] come representing this a man no he
[1:17:40] compromised for ten shekels and a shirt
[1:17:43] so how mature is this generation of
[1:17:47] believers compromising for oh they're
[1:17:49] compromising believes - compromising
[1:17:51] with that they're going to have this
[1:17:52] they're going to do this and do that
[1:17:53] a man where it was the time brother when
[1:17:56] we first came to the message there was
[1:17:57] absolute total separation a man from the
[1:18:01] world and the things of the world
[1:18:03] we were not influenced by the world and
[1:18:06] the things of the world God had the
[1:18:08] greater influence a male and the divine
[1:18:10] love of God and the greater influence a
[1:18:13] man we were living for God we were
[1:18:15] living for the word we're living for the
[1:18:17] message we're oh yeah we live for it to
[1:18:19] be a witness and a testimony of what God
[1:18:21] was doing in our day a man so but again
[1:18:26] believers today is becoming a form of
[1:18:28] godliness is becoming tradition is
[1:18:30] becoming denomination a man when it
[1:18:33] comes to I believe this oh yeah this is
[1:18:35] their Creed oh yeah this dis message
[1:18:39] right here and this is a message this
[1:18:41] message oh just Creed's yeah I believe
[1:18:43] this I believe that yeah so does the
[1:18:45] devil but go out and live it a man go
[1:18:49] out and walk in the will of God oh this
[1:18:51] is the will of God right here this
[1:18:53] doctrine this doctrine y'all but God
[1:18:55] wants to make it flesh a man God God
[1:18:59] promised the word to be made pledged to
[1:19:00] redeem man and I said and they look to
[1:19:03] this prophet they look to that prophet
[1:19:05] of that prophet but when they died they
[1:19:07] they were they put their bodies from the
[1:19:09] grade-a man but they were looking for
[1:19:11] one that would come back again a man but
[1:19:15] I said they were what they were needed
[1:19:17] was a God prophet until finally the God
[1:19:20] probably come a man and he lay down his
[1:19:22] life and he picked it up again and he
[1:19:24] experienced the resurrection it's me
[1:19:26] to rapture a man for the redemption of
[1:19:29] Israel a copy of each of his write for
[1:19:32] the redemption of the seed of God by the
[1:19:35] grace of God amen praise the name of the
[1:19:38] Lord to give us salvation a man and
[1:19:41] brother he did and again it was the god
[1:19:43] prophet then and God's Son of God
[1:19:45] fathered in this hour
[1:19:46] because there was this evangelist an
[1:19:48] evangelist this preacher that breacher
[1:19:50] and this apostle that parcel yeah but
[1:19:53] where's Jesus where is God a man brother
[1:19:57] a God in flesh the word in flesh oh yeah
[1:20:00] well I got it right here oh that's right
[1:20:02] there no no no
[1:20:03] yesterday that's that's good but is it
[1:20:05] in your flesh is there controlling your
[1:20:07] life
[1:20:08] it's a controlling the way you think and
[1:20:10] the way you act and the way that you're
[1:20:12] living a man is it taking you out of
[1:20:15] your will and bringing you more and more
[1:20:17] into the will of God a man so that
[1:20:19] you're living less and less and less for
[1:20:22] yourself you're living less and less and
[1:20:24] less for this world and you're living
[1:20:26] more and more and more for God you're
[1:20:28] living more and more for Jesus you're
[1:20:29] living more and more for the
[1:20:31] resurrection of the rapture a man but I
[1:20:34] tell you this if we get caught up in
[1:20:36] what God is doing brother we're going to
[1:20:38] get less and less conscious of the world
[1:20:41] oh yeah we'll get more conscious of God
[1:20:44] more conscious of the Resurrection more
[1:20:46] kinds of the rapture but I tell you that
[1:20:49] not many believers are conscious of what
[1:20:52] God is doing they're not conscious of
[1:20:54] the will of God and not by any means
[1:20:56] because they haven't made the sacrifices
[1:20:59] they need to make amen if they come into
[1:21:02] into a relationship with Jesus in an
[1:21:04] experience with Jesus
[1:21:05] a man in their souls not in their heads
[1:21:08] not in their flesh but in their souls if
[1:21:10] you've got an experience with Jesus
[1:21:12] you're gonna make the sacrifices a man
[1:21:14] that God is looking for a man and again
[1:21:17] again that I brother brought out and he
[1:21:19] said these are things that you have to
[1:21:21] sacrifice and then the more you're
[1:21:23] getting to the word the more the word
[1:21:25] controls you the more the message
[1:21:26] control show amen
[1:21:28] everything is the word the word the
[1:21:30] message the message God said this God is
[1:21:32] doing this God is doing that
[1:21:34] oh it's o'mine you're so caught up with
[1:21:36] the revelation
[1:21:37] the resurrection of the rapture hey man
[1:21:39] yo oh yeah they're not interested in you
[1:21:43] no no family is not interested in you
[1:21:46] their friends are not interested in you
[1:21:48] no no oh they're there to spiritual oh
[1:21:51] they're just really just you know they
[1:21:54] don't maybe consider your spiritual
[1:21:55] because that are your religious and
[1:21:57] they're all just cut out where you know
[1:21:59] with this cut up with that and brother
[1:22:01] there that was that was the persecution
[1:22:03] that believers experienced over the
[1:22:05] years then only as you don't experience
[1:22:07] much of that now because we're not
[1:22:09] living for the will of God and living
[1:22:12] out the will of God like they did back
[1:22:13] then because they're contracted too much
[1:22:16] cut out with the natural things of life
[1:22:19] a man oh yeah I believe this but I got
[1:22:22] want me to do this government me to do
[1:22:23] that sure they're saying that God want
[1:22:25] you do but now it had the expense of
[1:22:28] sacrificing the word amen brother
[1:22:32] aye brother Matthew brother he said
[1:22:35] things to sacrifice is ideas a man
[1:22:39] brother we got to sacrifice her own
[1:22:41] ideas because we're now God has brought
[1:22:43] us into his ideas a man and God has
[1:22:46] revealed his ideas to ass in this day
[1:22:49] and in this hour again going beyond
[1:22:51] Martin Luther going beyond wesley going
[1:22:53] beyond all the others amen going beyond
[1:22:56] Pentecost amen
[1:22:57] now we're in the bride age a man by the
[1:23:01] grace of God and again those that are
[1:23:03] children of the night are not going to
[1:23:05] recognize it but the children of the day
[1:23:07] are going to recognize it a man the true
[1:23:10] none tonight are going to oh they're
[1:23:11] going to try and justify their or their
[1:23:13] own will
[1:23:14] their God where God wants me to do this
[1:23:16] God want me to do that no no you got you
[1:23:18] got a maybe it's just what you want to
[1:23:20] do because you you got a religious
[1:23:22] spirit doing God a service without is
[1:23:25] will a man it's not according to the
[1:23:28] will of God it's not when God wants you
[1:23:30] to do it now how God wants you to do it
[1:23:32] where God wants you to do it ain't mad
[1:23:33] see you
[1:23:35] no wonder Jesus his sons and daughters
[1:23:37] of God and led by the Spirit of God
[1:23:39] because the Spirit of God keeps us in
[1:23:42] the will of God the spirit of God
[1:23:43] reveals the will of God
[1:23:45] the Spirit of God is going to live out
[1:23:47] the will of God amen
[1:23:49] and again a brother goes beyond just
[1:23:51] believing the letter of the message a
[1:23:53] man brother of the Spirit of God is
[1:23:55] going to make the message flesh in you
[1:23:57] he's going to make the message live
[1:23:59] itself out in you
[1:24:00] yes brother God was living himself out
[1:24:03] in Jesus and then Jesus came back to
[1:24:05] live himself out in the disciples a man
[1:24:07] they knew that here they had been with
[1:24:09] Jesus amen when they were brought into
[1:24:12] the council and brought in and tried for
[1:24:14] this and tried for that and they said
[1:24:17] now don't Doughboy and teach in the name
[1:24:18] of Jesus see they knew the Bible says
[1:24:21] they knew that they had been with Jesus
[1:24:22] a man is not just being religious but
[1:24:26] they've been with Jesus because now the
[1:24:28] Jesus that was in flesh now in the
[1:24:31] spirit he was revealing himself in them
[1:24:33] and what he was doing in his flesh is
[1:24:35] doing in them what he was what he was
[1:24:37] preaching in flesh he was preaching in

[1:40:00] the will of God he added to the will of
[1:40:03] the father and brother as believers we
[1:40:06] yield to the will of God we're here we
[1:40:09] got to make this choice we make this
[1:40:10] decision that decision
[1:40:11] what's the will of God in it Yoga is
[1:40:14] giving I'll tell you in the will of God
[1:40:16] you give God preeminence amen if it's
[1:40:21] hearing and seeing things the way that
[1:40:22] God wants you to see it you're going to

[1:40:26] preeminence amen
[1:40:27] if you've got a right motive and a right
[1:40:29] objective a meant for the glory of God

[1:40:41] his will but according to his will and

[1:40:47] because if you're not giving his will
[1:40:49] the preeminence then is your it's not

[1:40:53] you it's not me that lives as Christ

[1:41:07] this way amen
[1:41:08] I react this way react that way oh boy

[1:41:17] Jesus reacts that's the way Jesus talks
[1:41:20] and knowing that we're putting the
[1:41:22] emphasis on the same things that Jesus
[1:41:24] put his emphasis on and emphasis was on
[1:41:27] eternity going back to where he come
[1:41:31] from and the evidence and here when it
[1:41:34] comes to the the bright brother where

[1:43:31] you have you considered why the worlds
[1:43:33] can be like with no sin any bad if you
[1:43:38] considered the dimension we're going
[1:43:40] into and there's no sin
[1:43:42] there's not one iota of sin all gone
[1:43:47] thank God for such redemption god Elvis
[1:43:51] I pray our Lord oh my lord
[1:43:54] that had become more and more real to us
[1:43:56] but the problem of God has warned us
[1:43:59] that it's getting to that but at that
[1:44:00] time and getting to that place in the
[1:44:02] last days that your faith in God will be
[1:44:05] challenged and it is being challenged
[1:44:09] people don't want no real true love it
[1:44:12] living faith in God just the form of
[1:44:15] godliness or religion they'll do this
[1:44:17] too and there's gas getting less and
[1:44:18] less and less because more and more
[1:44:20] churches are closing no wonder Jesus
[1:44:27] said there be no flesh saved that's our
[1:44:35] bad skin god help us amen
[1:44:39] God don't let that it doesn't that bit
[1:44:42] of the world come on you let's stay
[1:44:44] under the Spirit of Christ under the
[1:44:46] Spirit of Jesus under the under the Holy
[1:44:49] Ghost in in this revealed word of this
[1:44:52] hour a mayor says not let her not
[1:44:55] dynamic not mechanics but dynamics time
[1:44:57] yeah back back in 63 and 65 the proud of
[1:45:01] God recognized said that most of the
[1:45:03] believers were putting the emphasis on
[1:45:04] the mechanics and not the dynamics
[1:45:09] he said considering what God has done he
[1:45:13] said it ought to put us in the rapture
[1:45:16] oh yeah man's gonna be without excuse
[1:45:22] for their lack of faith will he find
[1:45:26] faith when he comes and only that even
[1:45:29] back there in the Alpha ministry he said
[1:45:31] oh ye of little faith
[1:45:34] and then in the Omega ministry we're
[1:45:39] saying where is faith and what is faith
[1:45:44] a faith is the Holy Ghost revelation of
[1:45:46] God through his word in your heart and
[1:45:49] and not just the word for yesterday but
[1:45:52] the word for today what God is doing now
[1:45:56] amen
[1:45:58] this is the faith that pleases God you
[1:46:01] can read Hebrews 11 by faith able to do
[1:46:04] this by faith he did that it was it was
[1:46:06] for that day that hour that hour and
[1:46:08] right on down through but what is the
[1:46:11] faith that God looking for in you and me
[1:46:14] grace brother the will of God the will
[1:46:21] of God is governed by faith controlled
[1:46:26] by faith amen it is Christ in control
[1:46:31] and brother if he is in control and if
[1:46:35] the Holy Ghost is in control if Jesus is
[1:46:38] in control
[1:46:38] I'll turn to this brother where we are
[1:46:41] sacrificing our ideas constantly oh yeah
[1:46:46] it's an ongoing thing because the enemy
[1:46:48] is there to bring up your ideas well
[1:46:50] this this and this and you got a
[1:46:52] sacrifice amen
[1:46:55] oh but this appeals to the flesh it
[1:46:57] appeals to your feelings it appeals to
[1:46:59] this oh yeah
[1:46:59] no you got to sacrifice it anything
[1:47:03] that's appealing to your flesh brother
[1:47:05] is sin it's gonna take away from our
[1:47:07] faith you know why because in this our
[1:47:13] gals looking for absolute perfect thing
[1:47:16] and he said why you should we need
[1:47:19] perfect faith for the rapture a man so
[1:47:23] that it's not your ideas gonna interfere
[1:47:26] with it your feelings going to interfere
[1:47:28] with it what you want to do so on
[1:47:30] naturally no no you're going to give
[1:47:33] preeminence to the faith of the
[1:47:37] resurrection the faith of the rapture
[1:47:38] and again but not many are looking for
[1:47:41] it not many are living for it
[1:47:42] not many are praying for it now many are
[1:47:44] calling for it and brother to get it
[1:47:46] you've got a call for it
[1:47:48] you want the resurrection cohort you
[1:47:51] want the rapture call for not just say
[1:47:53] well I believe that the seals who gives
[1:47:56] us the perfect faith for the rapture
[1:47:57] yeah but is it is it active in you now
[1:48:02] if it's a perfect faith never dies for a
[1:48:06] faith will never it will never cease
[1:48:08] pure faith will be constantly active in
[1:48:10] your life and in your soul in your
[1:48:12] spirit amen amen
[1:48:14] because that's what you're living for
[1:48:16] praise the Lord it's like I said back to
[1:48:19] when the revivals were on when they
[1:48:21] greeted one another was all the lord the
[1:48:23] lord the lord and i remember being in in
[1:48:26] church went and went and when I first
[1:48:27] come to the message I go to the church
[1:48:29] out there and after church on mine well
[1:48:34] what about dinner this is why did it
[1:48:38] matter they never in coming to thoughts
[1:48:41] although they greet him one another on
[1:48:43] their way out of the church and then
[1:48:45] when they got out of the church
[1:48:46] oh there was there was there's there's
[1:48:48] somebody there so many there's somebody
[1:48:50] there somebody there and then we're
[1:48:52] talking about the word praising the Lord
[1:48:54] and praying for one another and so on
[1:48:56] oh it was amazing yeah and that went on
[1:49:01] for a number of years it did oh yeah I
[1:49:04] did they praise God they worship God and
[1:49:07] they were there I said they'd love to
[1:49:10] see one another old god bless you
[1:49:11] brother wonderful that you made it god
[1:49:13] bless your sister wonderful that you
[1:49:15] made it
[1:49:15] Amen so on praise the Lord oh I'm glad
[1:49:18] I'm glad thank the Lord Amen see praise
[1:49:22] the Lord it's like I told him when
[1:49:26] they're with me when I preached that
[1:49:32] first time and you know when he asked
[1:49:34] for the burns to pray and we all know
[1:49:36] those that lost that no brother burns
[1:49:38] nobody it was a quiet brother and a
[1:49:41] reserved brother but he was spiritual oh
[1:49:43] yes he was spiritual and he was a
[1:49:46] wonderful brother and they said oh
[1:49:48] brother Burns would you pray before we
[1:49:50] go in just watch the film by brother
[1:49:53] cater and so on and so brother Browns
[1:49:56] got off he said well praise the Lord
[1:49:57] first I said I want to thank the Lord he
[1:50:00] said for what he's done
[1:50:01] he said he opened up the way he said for
[1:50:03] me to get in here tonight because at the
[1:50:06] time brother Browns was working and he
[1:50:07] was so many miles but it almost novice
[1:50:09] hours drive from the church and he said
[1:50:12] buddy he said I'll have to say it he
[1:50:15] said but he said was the Lord that
[1:50:17] opened the way he said if it wasn't the
[1:50:20] Lord he said wouldn't have been able to
[1:50:22] make it he said but I thank the Lord
[1:50:24] and that's when of course the brother
[1:50:26] started to speak in tongues and that's
[1:50:29] unusual for him I can assure you that
[1:50:32] was and then our brother be legen most
[1:50:36] with seven notes for brother bill for
[1:50:39] sure and of course he got on and he got
[1:50:42] up interpreted and it confirmed what I
[1:50:45] said yeah it says yay that was heard my
[1:50:51] word my word they God went on and
[1:50:53] confirmed it confirmed it confirmed a
[1:50:55] man we were in the spirit everybody was
[1:50:59] in the spirit we've been into the film
[1:51:01] praising the Lord a man after the
[1:51:04] service I said we got his side and still
[1:51:06] fellowship fellowship fellowship
[1:51:08] fellowship did met at the time no didn't
[1:51:14] matter the time not by any means no why
[1:51:19] because we were anointed with eternity
[1:51:22] we had the eternal anointing on us it's
[1:51:25] time meant nothing to us no no not by
[1:51:29] any means but now here and more more
[1:51:33] caught up with time than eternity no
[1:51:36] more conscious of time than eternity oh
[1:51:38] yeah but the bride is caught up with
[1:51:42] eternity the eternal revelation of the
[1:51:47] resurrection rapture so brother he says
[1:51:50] the prophet said again he said we're
[1:51:52] putting too much emphasis on the
[1:51:54] mechanics of the doctrine and the
[1:51:57] revealed word but not enough he said on
[1:51:59] the dynamics because he said considering
[1:52:02] what God has done
[1:52:04] he said ought to bring the rapture
[1:52:07] amen so brother god help us to get more
[1:52:12] and more into the faith that pleases God
[1:52:15] and brother the more and more we get
[1:52:18] into faith the more and more that we're
[1:52:21] sacrificing in our natural lives we're
[1:52:26] sacrificing our ideas we're sacrificing
[1:52:28] our opinions a man what for because we
[1:52:33] want the will of God not our will
[1:52:35] amen we're sacrificing pride
[1:52:38] stubbornness oh yes stubbornness we're
[1:52:43] sacrificing our will for the will of God
[1:52:45] we're sacrificing our ambitions is not
[1:52:48] what we want is what God wants
[1:52:50] Oh humanly we have this ambition I want
[1:52:54] to do this I want to do they wanted it
[1:52:55] listen leave it with the Lord
[1:52:58] listen let's have God's ambitions Amen
[1:53:03] what is God's ambition right now amen
[1:53:08] where is God and what is God's ambitions
[1:53:11] what's what's on God's heart and mind
[1:53:13] it's all spirit what he wants to do this
[1:53:16] he wants to do that and I'll tell you
[1:53:17] this it's nothing out there you know
[1:53:20] that when he was here in flesh now he
[1:53:24] saw him no more in the world
[1:53:25] I'll tell your brother if we have come
[1:53:28] to that place we are no more in the
[1:53:29] world and were more conscious of
[1:53:31] eternity than then time and Jesus was
[1:53:34] was more conscious of eternity they knew
[1:53:37] that to brought the Bible highlights
[1:53:39] that because they knew there was a
[1:53:40] change in Jesus well when he went from
[1:53:45] the to the third pull of his ministry he
[1:53:47] was totally changed and the third pole
[1:53:49] bought a more and more conscious of
[1:53:52] eternity not time the kingdom of God not
[1:53:57] the king of man yeah and that's when he
[1:54:01] said I am no more in the world then we
[1:54:04] type of faith hey I am no more in the
[1:54:08] world are we coming to that thing well I
[1:54:13] no more in the world what do you mean
[1:54:15] well I'm more I'm more conscious of
[1:54:17] spiritual now I'm more conscious of the
[1:54:19] Lord and
[1:54:20] with the Lord and the saints of God and
[1:54:22] and the elect of God not not of this
[1:54:25] world
[1:54:26] oh how do you do that
[1:54:30] how'd you get that well it's Christ in
[1:54:33] me amen
[1:54:35] it's the will of God in control a man
[1:54:39] the will of God in control bringing us
[1:54:43] to that place to sacrifice our human
[1:54:46] ambitions what do you love do you love
[1:54:52] this stuff more than you love God you
[1:54:55] love this whole world mourn you love the
[1:54:56] kingdom of God you love the atmosphere
[1:54:58] here more than you love the atmosphere
[1:54:59] in the kingdom of God know the saints of
[1:55:04] God hate this but they love that like
[1:55:12] God said he said Jacob have I loved and
[1:55:14] Esau have I hated and I check that to go
[1:55:19] back to the original and I said Lord
[1:55:22] does that mean Heat and I checked it and
[1:55:26] it did it did it meant hate why because
[1:55:32] Esau never had the hunger thirst for the
[1:55:37] things of God than Jacob did that it did
[1:55:39] dare Jacob did
[1:55:40] oh the things of God
[1:55:44] he just wanted he just wanted the
[1:55:46] inheritance yes but you know what the
[1:55:49] inheritance included not just his might
[1:55:54] his father and mother's wealth and
[1:55:56] possessions no no but it included a
[1:56:01] spiritual relationship with God he
[1:56:05] wrestled with the angel after when he
[1:56:07] was on his way back
[1:56:08] and the angel changed his name
[1:56:11] hallelujah thank God he changed irony
[1:56:15] huh her mrs. Jesus Christ amen
[1:56:20] so brother God hated that unbelief
[1:56:24] we hate unbelief we hate the things that
[1:56:27] are caught up with this world not the
[1:56:30] person but the spirit dishonor by the
[1:56:32] grace of God
[1:56:33] god help us Lord that we're going to
[1:56:37] sacrifice possessions and he highlighted
[1:56:41] for you for you I think the rich young
[1:56:43] ruler he was caught up with his worldly
[1:56:46] possessions and I did a lot of believers
[1:56:48] don't want to make the sacrifice no the
[1:56:54] more they got the more the better they
[1:56:55] feel when it comes to worldly
[1:56:58] possessions especially money yeah and
[1:57:02] there's heirs Jesus he had nowhere to
[1:57:05] lay his head amazing and I thought sure
[1:57:11] it was her - preacher preaching about
[1:57:13] John the Baptist's he said just think
[1:57:16] John the Baptist's never had no mansion
[1:57:18] he had no home you didn't have this he
[1:57:21] said I guess he said he washed his
[1:57:22] clothes when they when they turn a
[1:57:24] different color where he wore them so
[1:57:26] long so he just grew down into the water
[1:57:29] and wash them yeah do you just consider
[1:57:36] the sons and daughters of God and the
[1:57:38] way they went
[1:57:40] rather the prophets what they endured
[1:57:43] what are we enduring amen the stand they
[1:57:47] took well stand are we taken the
[1:57:49] attitude they had in the day after the
[1:57:52] day of Pentecost and down to the church
[1:57:54] ages oh my brother my brother my brother
[1:57:57] how many would have this attitude to
[1:57:59] that sister when they told her that tree
[1:58:03] she didn't recant they were going to
[1:58:05] kill her daughter and she said kill her
[1:58:07] she said we'll meet in glory not many
[1:58:12] would do that they would try to figure
[1:58:14] out something to compromise oh I'll do
[1:58:17] this and I'll do that no she said that's
[1:58:19] all right
[1:58:19] you can kill her and she said we'll meet
[1:58:21] a lot of Revelation of heaven water
[1:58:24] revelation of eternity
[1:58:26] hey what faith did that sister hand she
[1:58:30] said oh I'll meet her in joy and they
[1:58:36] killed the child and they killed a
[1:58:38] mother and again also there was a ship
[1:58:42] coming from England to here I believe
[1:58:44] and doers into a storm and they didn't
[1:58:50] know what to do you know and they said
[1:58:53] to this woman well one person that was
[1:58:56] on it oh yes the cat remember his name
[1:58:57] now but he just came here to minister to
[1:58:59] the Indians in in North America in it
[1:59:02] and went back home but it was a big
[1:59:05] storm and he was very nervous he was
[1:59:07] frightened to death but he said he went
[1:59:09] down in lower partnership and here was
[1:59:14] this group of people they're singing and
[1:59:17] pray and praising the Lord and hey oh
[1:59:22] what faith and he was praying to God
[1:59:25] that he would have that pain why they
[1:59:28] weren't worried they said we were
[1:59:30] leading them with the Lord amen oh he
[1:59:33] said wonderful wonderful yeah praise the
[1:59:36] Lord hallelujah brother god Whitney
[1:59:40] faith faith not knowledge not ideas
[1:59:45] faith and faith is in our hearts that's
[1:59:49] where God is looking for it in our heart
[1:59:51] not in your head do you have faith in
[1:59:53] your heart a man so let's sacrifice the
[1:59:59] time that we need for ourselves let's
[2:00:02] give it to the Lord
[2:00:03] we gotta sacrifice ourselves and our
[2:00:06] past regrets sacrifices you're not going
[2:00:11] to feel bad about sacrificing these
[2:00:13] things for the Lord you're gonna feel
[2:00:14] good because God is gonna bless you with
[2:00:16] his presence and his anointing because
[2:00:18] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[2:00:20] spirit a broken and a contrite heart O
[2:00:23] God thou wilt not despise a man and
[2:00:29] again as I did with brother marks notes
[2:00:31] I might print them and give you good
[2:00:33] copies of them so grace so brother the
[2:00:39] will of God is what counts in our lives

[2:01:31] or my brethren and he looked around

[2:05:08] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[2:05:11] infirmities for we know not what we
[2:05:14] should pray for as we ought but the
[2:05:18] spirit of self making intercession for
[2:05:20] us with groanings which cannot be
[2:05:23] uttered and he that searches the hearts
[2:05:27] known what is the mind of the Spirit
[2:05:30] because he maketh intercession for the
[2:05:33] Saints according to the will of God amen
[2:05:37] so when you pray get in the spirit
[2:05:40] and rather than then he's going to pray
[2:05:42] according to the will of God for your
[2:05:45] life and for other brothers and sisters
[2:05:47] amen
[2:05:49] so he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[2:05:52] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[2:05:54] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[2:05:57] according to the will of God and we know
[2:06:00] that all things work together for good
[2:06:03] to them that love God and to them who
[2:06:06] are the called according to his purpose

[2:08:14] scriptures concerning the will of God
[2:08:21] showing the importance and the
[2:08:23] significance of the will of God in our
[2:08:26] lives in Ephesians six verse five
[2:08:35] servants be obedient to them that are
[2:08:38] your masters according to the flesh with
[2:08:42] fear and trembling in singleness of your

[2:09:33] Lord and not to men again giving the
[2:09:37] preeminence to God by the grace of God
[2:09:41] go to 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 first
[2:09:50] Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 16 said

[2:10:58] lives for the glory of God go to first
[2:11:02] John chapter 2 a man a man and a man
[2:11:12] and verse 15 love not the world neither
[2:11:22] the things that are in the world
[2:11:24] If any man love the world the love of
[2:11:27] the father is not in him for all that is
[2:11:31] in the world the lust of the flesh and
[2:11:34] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[2:11:36] life is not of the Father but is of the
[2:11:40] world and the world passeth away and the
[2:11:43] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[2:11:47] of God abideth for ever amen eternal
[2:11:52] life lays in the will of God praise the
[2:11:56] Lord that grace that we're doing the
[2:11:59] will of God by the grace of God amen
[2:12:05] thank the Lord
[2:12:08] you don't have to turn to it you have
[2:12:15] need of patience that after yes you're
[2:12:20] hearing brother journal you need
[2:12:21] patience thank the Lord you have needed
[2:12:27] patience that after he have done the
[2:12:28] will of God he might receive the promise
[2:12:32] after you've done the will of God
[2:12:35] that's Hebrews 10 36 thank God
[2:12:38] grace amen that we did we are doing the
[2:12:43] will of God amen
[2:12:47] praise the Lord one more scripture to
[2:12:51] see
[2:12:59] yeah where the time has come that
[2:13:05] judgment must begin at the house of God
[2:13:10] amen
[2:13:11] by the going forth of the word and he
[2:13:15] said if at first begin at us
[2:13:17] what shall the end be of them that obey
[2:13:20] not the gospel and if the righteous
[2:13:24] scarcely be saved where shall the
[2:13:26] ungodly and the sinner appear amazing
[2:13:31] wherefore let them that suffer according
[2:13:36] to the will of God commit the keeping of
[2:13:39] their souls to him in well-doing as on
[2:13:43] to a faithful creator you suffer
[2:13:47] according to the will of God commit
[2:13:48] everything to the Lord a man and he'll
[2:13:52] bless you and he'll encourage you it was
[2:13:57] in the message I have heard but now I
[2:14:03] see he said see we don't use the gift of
[2:14:12] God for commercial he could tell me
[2:14:16] where it was at but I don't have any
[2:14:18] need of it I wouldn't even have faith
[2:14:21] enough to ask him if I had a need of it
[2:14:24] I believe if I'd asked him he'd tell me
[2:14:28] but first see your motives and
[2:14:31] objectives as to being right you have to
[2:14:35] have reasons for this God don't give you
[2:14:38] those things just because you ask and
[2:14:40] you cannot ask in faith unless there's a
[2:14:44] real objective to that what is the
[2:14:49] objective he said to be in the will of
[2:14:52] God a man that's it brother sister
[2:14:56] regardless of what you ask God for is it
[2:14:59] the will of God yes it's going to put
[2:15:01] you more and more in the will of God
[2:15:02] well we ask God for what we want is to
[2:15:05] be more and more and more in the will of
[2:15:07] God and the bride will be mourn the will
[2:15:10] of God the closer we get to the change
[2:15:12] of course we get to the rapture if you
[2:15:17] want to be well what do you want to be
[2:15:19] well for if you want to be healed
[2:15:21] what's the reason you want to be healed
[2:15:23] this is amazing he said you got to have
[2:15:30] a right motive right objector to be
[2:15:31] healed what's the right motive right
[2:15:33] objective for the glory of God
[2:15:36] he said not because you want to get
[2:15:38] better no no is you can be healed and go
[2:15:41] to hell
[2:15:43] yeah but if your motive is right your
[2:15:47] objectives right it's for the glory of
[2:15:48] God amen
[2:15:50] and he said what do you want to do with
[2:15:53] your life when you get healed
[2:15:55] do you want to serve God more give more
[2:15:59] to God not there not not the natural
[2:16:01] life no no you wanting you want to
[2:16:04] change it to a spiritual life and live
[2:16:06] for the Lord give premise to him there
[2:16:11] he said you've got to have a motive and
[2:16:12] objective and they have to be right
[2:16:14] according to the will of God your motive
[2:16:18] and objective got to be according to the
[2:16:20] will of God by the grace of God he said
[2:16:28] how about the Alaskan earthquake watch
[2:16:32] Hollywood fall into the sea brother
[2:16:35] David was mentioning something about an
[2:16:37] earthquake or something in California
[2:16:39] and not an earthquake but they're doing
[2:16:44] something there because of the land of
[2:16:45] sinking what is it it's the warning to
[2:16:50] the people you talk about the grace of
[2:16:53] God he prophesied it prophesied it and
[2:16:55] when the prophet prophesied it in 1965 I
[2:16:59] believe or 63 a number of believers left
[2:17:02] California and moved to Tucson but still
[2:17:07] there are professing believers in
[2:17:08] California amazing but we know that
[2:17:15] California is going down California is
[2:17:17] going under and it's going to be
[2:17:19] something like five hundred miles one
[2:17:20] way 1,500 miles off yeah
[2:17:25] so I believe it's going to affect even
[2:17:26] even British Columbia yeah so brother
[2:17:37] even people that live in California now
[2:17:41] there's some that live close to the
[2:17:43] water and they they're putting up brick
[2:17:46] walls because they feel that the water
[2:17:49] is rising and they want to keep the
[2:17:53] water out of their property well the
[2:17:57] water is not rising the land is going
[2:17:59] down oh yeah we studied that I brought
[2:18:03] some of those things out a number of
[2:18:04] years ago what's going on in California
[2:18:07] now probably God
[2:18:10] they take challenge so what the Prophet
[2:18:12] said to Billy Paul and he said he says
[2:18:15] you'll be young man he said you you you
[2:18:17] you see this happen
[2:18:18] well Billy Paul's in his 80s but they
[2:18:22] say well he's not a young man I said oh
[2:18:25] yes he is I said it's the off and he's
[2:18:28] young I see only about 20 years old in
[2:18:31] his theophany body and he might be we
[2:18:34] don't know he might be in his theophany
[2:18:36] leave his physical body go to the
[2:18:38] theophany when california goes under
[2:18:41] that's right brother round saw a young
[2:18:44] man in division so he might have seen
[2:18:48] him in another dimension we don't know
[2:18:50] but again even a young brother Joel
[2:18:55] Brandt he's going on now for sure that
[2:18:59] he saw when he was in hospital and he
[2:19:01] had the dreams even before brother
[2:19:03] Branham prophesied it he saw California
[2:19:07] go under
[2:19:07] he saw the cars going here he saw them
[2:19:10] going up north to Canada and so on and
[2:19:13] going to to eastern United States
[2:19:15] why because he saw that he saw the
[2:19:17] disaster he said this is going to happen
[2:19:19] this is going to he saw this this and
[2:19:21] this and this but when he saw it you and
[2:19:26] I are witnessing what he saw in the in
[2:19:29] the natural world the way people are
[2:19:32] dressing and the way they're acting
[2:19:36] he was shocked at it because that was on
[2:19:41] Adam back in his day when he had that
[2:19:43] dream you know cuz men were men boys
[2:19:47] were boys girls were girls and women
[2:19:49] were women you know but what he saw in
[2:19:52] division he said what's that where's
[2:19:54] this you know as I said he saw those
[2:19:58] those uh follows there and and one of
[2:20:01] the men earrings in and he said earrings
[2:20:05] because that was on Earl of back then
[2:20:09] nothing like that
[2:20:10] and he saw another fella dressed this
[2:20:12] way then he saw the girls dressed this
[2:20:14] way then he saw the cars not like the
[2:20:19] cars that he that he saw in his day
[2:20:21] Lonnie said what's that and then he said
[2:20:24] something but the President of the
[2:20:25] United States and he went over to the
[2:20:27] newspaper on by a drugstore there and
[2:20:30] looked at it to prison United States and
[2:20:31] he looked at the picture he said that's
[2:20:34] not president he said who in the world
[2:20:37] is that it could be the president that's
[2:20:40] there now oh yeah so but when he saw it
[2:20:47] in the paper back then that's years and
[2:20:49] years and years ago I got I got a copy a
[2:20:51] printed copy of his of his testimony but
[2:20:54] what he saw of course he's gone on now
[2:20:57] yeah brother Perry green gave me the
[2:21:00] printed copy of brother Joe Brandt's
[2:21:02] dreams yeah and it was way back he may
[2:21:09] be in the 1920s now brother as I said
[2:21:15] I'm going to go to consider scripture
[2:21:17] consider prophecy and to see if we can I
[2:21:19] like how close we are to the end how
[2:21:24] close we are to the rapture and the
[2:21:26] resurrection Satan is the god of this
[2:21:32] world
[2:21:32] definitely so brother how about the
[2:21:38] Alaskan earthquake watch all he would
[2:21:41] fall into the sea he said watch and see
[2:21:44] if it doesn't he's never told me
[2:21:46] anything wrong yet and just watch and
[2:21:48] see if we're not living in
[2:21:50] closing hours of history no man knows
[2:21:53] what hour is coming and he said I
[2:21:57] believe in my present condition if I'm
[2:22:00] in my right mind if I wasn't a Christian
[2:22:02] I sure want to be a real Bible Christian
[2:22:05] not a denominational don't rely upon
[2:22:10] because you shouted we heard that this
[2:22:13] morning proved it by the Word of God
[2:22:15] it's altogether out of the will of God
[2:22:17] and didn't do a thing but cause death
[2:22:19] but don't be in the stock be in the life
[2:22:23] have faith in God a man the Prophet
[2:22:29] explained about planting a seed well
[2:22:31] that's good it's planted then it comes
[2:22:33] on up to stalk but that's good just name
[2:22:35] wrong with that thank God for the stock
[2:22:37] then it's leaves well thank God for the
[2:22:40] leaves and it goes right are not right
[2:22:42] on up to finally got a got a breakout
[2:22:44] into seed just like the seed that was
[2:22:48] planted it's got to come forth at the
[2:22:50] top and that's where we are now amen
[2:22:54] what he planted is coming forth amen
[2:23:03] he said don't rely upon cuz this we
[2:23:08] heard that this morning but proved it by
[2:23:10] the word it's all together
[2:23:11] out of the will of God he said didn't do
[2:23:14] a thing but caused death so don't be in
[2:23:17] the stock being the life of faith in God
[2:23:20] that is the message I have heard but now
[2:23:23] I see Whitley gone through amen
[2:23:29] when it comes to the will of God has
[2:23:32] mentioned many many many times in the
[2:23:34] scripture and we'll finish with these
[2:23:39] the prophet of God I lighted the will of
[2:23:45] God in 1947 a man 72 years ago he said
[2:23:54] notice that when he said that said he
[2:23:57] could only speak what God put in his
[2:24:00] mouth
[2:24:01] and God told him to send them back
[2:24:03] Balaam like a lot of Ireland prophets
[2:24:07] now for money he come back and again and
[2:24:10] ask him the second time and he went to
[2:24:13] God again now look there is a perfect
[2:24:18] will of God and there is a permissive
[2:24:22] will of God and God permitted His
[2:24:26] Prophet to go on yet it wasn't his
[2:24:29] perfect will
[2:24:29] it was his permissive will and I feel
[2:24:33] this afternoon is the same thing on
[2:24:35] working these these miracle lines
[2:24:37] it is God's maybe permissive will but
[2:24:41] it's not his perfect will he said you're
[2:24:44] supposed to take me at my word Amen so
[2:24:51] brother God brought us to his perfect
[2:24:54] will in the third pole the old me of the
[2:24:57] word to give us perfect faith a man he
[2:25:02] said friends I've got something to say
[2:25:04] along them after a bit no matter how
[2:25:06] much faith you have it'll never change
[2:25:09] the predestinated will of God amen and
[2:25:15] he talks about Balaam again the Ireland
[2:25:18] prophet came down to stop Israel and he
[2:25:22] said we'll get into that
[2:25:24] and he said out of that fellow a dumb
[2:25:27] mule had to speak and rebuked Balaam
[2:25:32] they didn't see the angel but the mule
[2:25:37] he was writing on did and the mule heard
[2:25:42] the angel the mule was avoiding the
[2:25:47] angel three times the angel spoke and
[2:25:50] Balaam was mad with the be mule and he
[2:25:55] and he slapped the mule three times
[2:25:58] under finally the angel went down in the
[2:26:01] narrow path and stood so the mule
[2:26:05] certainly couldn't go through and he
[2:26:09] went up against the wall and he struck
[2:26:11] Balaam's legs on the wall Balin got
[2:26:14] vicious
[2:26:15] and they're finally the mule spoke talk
[2:26:21] to dr. Beeler amazing just thing God was
[2:26:27] dealing with this way
[2:26:28] just stop Balaam but if mule recognize
[2:26:32] it the animals recognize it but the man
[2:26:34] didn't a man and the animal was was was
[2:26:37] in fear of the angel and feared God a
[2:26:40] man till finally the angel spoke and
[2:26:44] Balaam song and he was rebuked for for
[2:26:49] slapping the the donkey he's away have
[2:26:52] you done this to that donkey he heard my
[2:26:54] voice and he saw me any any any feared
[2:26:56] God and so on but he said you never
[2:26:59] heard me and you never saw me and you
[2:27:00] didn't fear God and he still didn't fear
[2:27:02] God a man and he said the a preacher out
[2:27:07] of the will of God and his mind on money
[2:27:10] and a mule had to rebuke him brother
[2:27:15] sister let's get let's get into will of
[2:27:18] God don't wait for the mule and he said
[2:27:23] had to rebuke him down there a dumb mule
[2:27:26] and if God could speak through a dumb
[2:27:28] mule surely he could talk through a man
[2:27:32] yes sir
[2:27:33] amen brother we got to be in the spirit
[2:27:37] and in the will of God to recognize it
[2:27:40] in 1955 he said that's what you need a
[2:27:44] calling back to God and if the Holy
[2:27:46] Ghost condemned it in the beginning it's
[2:27:49] the same only goes tonight he doesn't
[2:27:51] change and the Pentecostal church has
[2:27:54] let down the burrs and got to start see
[2:27:56] now he said what we need is an
[2:27:58] old-fashioned calling back to the
[2:27:59] presence of God again and you know
[2:28:02] that's right and he said used to be a
[2:28:04] long time ago it was different but
[2:28:06] what's happened he said the reason your
[2:28:08] cooling off and he said the reason
[2:28:10] you're getting out of the will of God
[2:28:13] that's why your cooling off getting out
[2:28:17] of the will of God he says that's the
[2:28:19] reason you can't cooperate with one
[2:28:21] another he said you're putting more
[2:28:22] attention on your organization then you
[2:28:25] are to your Lord he says that's exactly
[2:28:28] right he said I would rather go and have
[2:28:32] a church with 50 people in the will of
[2:28:34] God than to go and have 5000 out of the
[2:28:38] will of God that's right
[2:28:40] and we've had people lead this church
[2:28:42] because they preferred bigger churches a
[2:28:44] man and they've gone and made a number
[2:28:48] of years ago they left so they could go
[2:28:50] to a bigger Church why so they could
[2:28:53] hide among the trees of the garden now
[2:28:57] they didn't like a ministry that was
[2:29:00] getting too personal as you know the
[2:29:04] brother and he's in Alberta now and I
[2:29:09] trust someday we'll see him again soon
[2:29:11] but he he's into the church for a number
[2:29:15] of years and he's a brother that said
[2:29:19] all he said after brother duro finishes
[2:29:23] preach and he said the seats are filled
[2:29:24] with blood because he felt that brother
[2:29:28] Gerald preached so hard he said
[2:29:30] everybody was bleeding he's Superman
[2:29:32] when I finished oh yeah so I prayed the
[2:29:35] grace of God that that brother come back
[2:29:36] most of us here knowing anybody is but
[2:29:40] he's his son will be ministering for us
[2:29:42] next month amen so the grace of God to
[2:29:47] him
[2:29:54] okay I'd rather have a church for 50
[2:29:56] people in the will of God than 5000 out
[2:29:59] of the will of God he said remember he
[2:30:04] is stumbling and staggering like a
[2:30:06] shooting in the dark but when a man is
[2:30:07] really in the will of God and knows his
[2:30:10] calling he will abide there came was
[2:30:15] such a person that he was very religious
[2:30:17] indeed he was just as religious and
[2:30:21] sincere as abel he worshiped God he had
[2:30:24] a church he built an altar he made a
[2:30:27] sacrifice he prayed he worshiped but he
[2:30:30] was rejected why because it was out of
[2:30:34] the will of God he refused the will of
[2:30:37] God religion that Satan's business not
[2:30:41] to kill the whole thing but to
[2:30:42] contaminate it
[2:30:43] so he said notice he said Cain came to
[2:30:47] worship but he had the wrong seed in him
[2:30:49] serpent seed the hiss of the serpent at
[2:30:52] east over him for he was the seed of the
[2:30:55] woman and he knew the perfect will of
[2:30:57] God but he refused to do it God's grace
[2:31:00] that will do the will of God not your
[2:31:04] will his will he said did you know that
[2:31:07] Satan knows the will of God but just
[2:31:09] refuses to do it and notice he had seen
[2:31:13] God vindicate Abel's message Abel's
[2:31:16] correct message that God vindicated to
[2:31:19] be the truth are you drawing now Abel's
[2:31:22] message had been received and Cain saw
[2:31:25] it and knew that God had vindicated that
[2:31:27] message right but he just couldn't do it
[2:31:30] his pride
[2:31:31] kept him from it that's right his pride
[2:31:34] kept him from it he's seen God vindicate
[2:31:38] the message amen
[2:31:40] god help us get in the will of God stay
[2:31:45] in the will of God in all circumstances
[2:31:47] in all situations seek the will of God
