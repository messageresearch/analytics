[42:19] for you and to desire that you might be
[42:21] filled with the knowledge of his will in
[42:24] all wisdom and spiritual understanding
[42:27] what's the purpose of this prayer he
[42:29] says that you might walk worthy of the
[42:31] Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in
[42:35] every good work and increasing in the
[42:38] knowledge of God strengthened with all
[42:40] might according to his glorious power
[42:44] unto all patience and longsuffering with
[42:47] joyfulness amen God bless you you can
[42:49] have your seats again this evening we're
[42:51] continuing our series on the Holy Ghost
[42:53] we're taking a a fifth service on how do
[42:55] I know I have received the Holy Holy
[42:57] Spirit and we've been talking about the
[43:00] evidence in last service we set a
[43:01] foundation on the fruit of the Holy
[43:03] Spirit and we took the words of Jesus
[43:05] where he says by their fruits you will
[43:07] know them and so we know who people are
[43:09] based on the fruit of their life and we
[43:11] compare that to what the word says about
[43:13] it amen we know the evidence of the
[43:15] receiving the holy spirit is that you
[43:17] would he he will lead you into all truth
[43:19] he'll lead you into the word and that's
[43:21] so that you can become the word it's not
[43:23] just so we can know the word it's not
[43:24] just so we can we can spew it back out
[43:27] and we can tell people what we know it's
[43:28] but but it's so that we can be the word
[43:30] amen that's what a True Believer is as
[43:32] they become one with the word but as we
[43:35] speak on this this evening and and to be
[43:37] honest we're not even going to get into
[43:38] the fruit of the spirit this evening
[43:41] that's just the way things go sometimes
[43:42] as you dig into it but I want to I want
[43:44] to take us all the way back to Genesis
[43:46] because when we talk about the fruit of
[43:48] the spirit it seems like it's really a
[43:50] new testament thing but when you start
[43:52] looking at being fruitful as Paul talked
[43:54] about in Colossians and fruit bearing if
[43:56] we could put it that way we go all the
[43:58] way back to Genesis and even into the
[44:00] first chapter and we see that being a
[44:02] fruit bearing person was the desire and
[44:05] the purpose of God even for us and so
[44:07] God when he's talking to Adam in in
[44:09] Genesis 1 we see this in Genesis 1:27 it
[44:12] says so God created Man In His Image in
[44:15] the image of God created he him and male
[44:17] and female created he them and God
[44:20] blessed them and said unto them these
[44:22] words be
[44:24] fruitful multiply replace the Earth and
[44:28] subdue it now we're we're preaching on
[44:30] the the fruit of the spirit but I want
[44:32] you to see here that God says I want you
[44:34] to be
[44:35] fruitful and what is that that sign of
[44:37] fruitfulness how do you know if you're
[44:39] fruitful the way God wants you to God
[44:41] saying being fruitful and multiply well
[44:43] what is Adam Adam's a Son of God God's
[44:46] saying produce more sons of God that's
[44:49] how Adam could be known to be successful
[44:51] by the word as if he produced more of
[44:54] God more people that were in the image
[44:56] of God and and then he said on top of
[44:58] that have dominion over the fish of the
[44:59] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[45:01] over every living thing that moveth upon
[45:03] the Earth so we see the purpose of God
[45:06] here by his word the purpose of God was
[45:08] to produce a family on this Earth and
[45:11] that family on Earth would have dominion
[45:13] but it was not Dominion by force it was
[45:16] not Dominion by conquering it was
[45:18] Dominion by the word amen it was
[45:21] Dominion by the spirit of God working in
[45:22] Men We were supposed to rule because we
[45:25] were children of God not because because
[45:27] we had beaten up and destroyed anything
[45:28] that tried to come after us it was a
[45:30] kingdom of love and peace in the
[45:32] beginning our rulership was in that
[45:34] peace and rest not by strength of our
[45:36] arms or anything like that or weapons
[45:38] that we made it says and then God said
[45:41] behold I have given you every herb
[45:42] bearing seed which is upon the face of
[45:45] all the Earth and every tree in the
[45:47] which is the fruit of a tree yielding
[45:48] seed to you it shall be for meat and to
[45:52] every beast of the earth and to every
[45:53] fowl of the air and to everything that
[45:55] creepeth upon the Earth wherein there's
[45:57] life I have given every green herb for
[45:59] meat and it was so so God gave from the
[46:02] very beginning this is in perfect life
[46:05] perfect bodies sinless perfect human
[46:08] bodies God gave us food God gave us
[46:11] fruit and that fruit was intended to to
[46:14] benefit the body and I I I don't know
[46:16] exactly why God did it that way and I
[46:18] hate to admit it but the original diet
[46:20] was
[46:23] vegetarian but they enjoyed it so maybe
[46:26] when I'm truly sinless I'll enjoy
[46:28] vegetables and fruit alone because over
[46:30] there we're not going to do those things
[46:32] but but you look here that the fruit of
[46:34] the Earth was what provided for those
[46:36] that were on the earth and it was for
[46:39] the humans it was for the animals it was
[46:41] for every type of living creature and
[46:44] person the fruit that was produced was
[46:47] for their life it was for their body to
[46:50] to to have nutrients and these things
[46:52] Adam had eternal life his body would
[46:54] never have died if he had not fallen in
[46:56] sin amen if he hadn't chosen to sin and
[46:59] yet God had designed these bodies in
[47:01] their perfection to eat and I don't know
[47:04] why maybe it's for pleasure we certainly
[47:06] seem to enjoy eating but we see that
[47:09] even when we go the first thing we do
[47:11] when we leave this earth is do what
[47:15] eat the marriage supper of the lamb and
[47:17] it's not just a quick meal it's three
[47:19] and a half years of eating and in the
[47:21] Millennium we're planting and we're
[47:23] harvesting and we're eating and there
[47:24] are feasts and all of these things
[47:27] and then you go into the New
[47:29] Jerusalem and guess what it's got fruit
[47:32] over there too so fruit is there and
[47:36] it's God's way of doing something in our
[47:38] bodies and and and so in all of this God
[47:41] when he put us here it was to produce
[47:44] fruit it was to be fruitful if I could
[47:46] put it that way but I want you to see
[47:48] something that that fruit that Adam was
[47:51] going to plant and nurture and harvest
[47:54] was not eternal life it was for natural
[47:57] life but that was not eternal life
[47:59] because there was a tree of life that
[48:01] had fruit if we wanted to call it that
[48:03] and that tree was Christ and that is
[48:05] where eternal life came from there was
[48:07] something there for their natural bodies
[48:09] and then there was something there for
[48:11] their soul as well and that was the
[48:12] fruit that really mattered and as long
[48:14] as they were eating from that tree of
[48:16] life then they could always make it
[48:18] through but yet he had a job and that
[48:21] job was to sustain life on this Earth he
[48:23] had to sustain the animals he had to
[48:26] sustain cre by the planting of of the
[48:28] garden and these different things
[48:31] brother Bron would say and I don't have
[48:32] the quote here I just read it in my
[48:34] office he says we are formed to the word
[48:37] image to be a partaker of the word and
[48:41] to feed on the word he said that in the
[48:42] message who is this mzc so our feeding
[48:45] is not on the fruit that we produce it's
[48:47] to feed on the word it's to feed on
[48:49] Christ that was where eternal life was
[48:50] from but they had a natural body that
[48:53] was sustained by the fruit of the earth
[48:55] it was from the earth it was stained by
[48:57] the Earth if we could put it that way so
[48:59] God says to to to Adam he says you've
[49:01] got to be fruitful in your body you've
[49:03] got to produce more of me he says and
[49:05] you've got to subdue the Earth you have
[49:06] to have dominion over it but watch what
[49:08] the purpose of that Dominion is it says
[49:10] and the Lord took the man Lord God took
[49:13] the man and put him into the Garden of
[49:14] Eden to dress it and to keep it so
[49:17] Adam's got a purpose and Adam's got a
[49:20] job so Adam's job is to manage the
[49:23] garden so that the plants are fruitful
[49:26] if it's to make sure that the conditions
[49:28] are right so that botney life can come
[49:30] forth amen so his life's purpose is to
[49:33] reproduce God in flesh and his day job
[49:37] is to make sure that life on Earth
[49:38] continues as it was meant to two
[49:41] different things he's got to feed the
[49:42] the spiritual and he's got to feed the
[49:44] natural if we could put it that way it
[49:46] says and the Lord God commanded the man
[49:47] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[49:49] mayest freely eat God has something for
[49:51] us to eat and he says everything I've
[49:54] given you can eat he says but of the
[49:56] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou
[49:58] shalt not eat of it for in the day that
[50:00] thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely
[50:02] die so there was trees for food and then
[50:04] there was a tree you weren't allowed to
[50:06] touch we've already covered this in in
[50:08] great detail but the reason I'm going
[50:11] here is because we want to see what
[50:13] we're being redeemed back to if we see
[50:16] what it was in Genesis then we can see
[50:18] what the purpose of fruit is today what
[50:20] the purpose of God is in our lives and
[50:22] these different things and so we're
[50:23] talking about the fruit of the spirit
[50:25] but we want to see what it means to be
[50:27] Pro fruitful in God's eyes and in God's
[50:30] eyes being fruitful was to produce more
[50:32] Sons and Daughters of God that was his
[50:34] original purpose yes God wanted Adam to
[50:36] provide food for himself and for the
[50:38] animals and these different things but
[50:40] God said be per be fruitful in your
[50:42] person and then be fruitful in your
[50:44] labor there's two different things that
[50:46] are going on there and then we saw that
[50:48] Adam and Eve they fell by Disobedience
[50:50] and now their purpose Remains the Same
[50:53] but they've lost the power they've lost
[50:55] the Dominion amen then they they've got
[50:57] a Godly purpose but they've hybrid God's
[51:01] system and so now they've got to
[51:03] struggle in all of these things and it's
[51:05] a battle every day for Adam to produce
[51:07] his fruit amen he might do everything
[51:10] right but because he's lost his Dominion
[51:13] he has no guarantee of the results amen
[51:16] now he's subject to his
[51:19] environment rather than his environment
[51:21] is subject to him you'll see where we're
[51:24] going with this as we go through so he
[51:26] he's a he's a he's supposed to be
[51:28] producing fruit but now he's got storms
[51:30] he's got Sun he's got wind he's got rain
[51:33] and now that's controlling his fruit
[51:35] production in terms of botney life but
[51:38] then he also has circumstances in this
[51:40] fleshly body because he's awakened a
[51:42] carnal desire that he's not supposed to
[51:44] have and now he's what controlled by
[51:46] that as well listen remember we've said
[51:49] before Man Without a be Man without the
[51:51] Holy Ghost is a beast and when man fell
[51:54] from the word of God then the Beast Le
[51:56] nature came out and that's what we're
[51:58] dealing with today and so now Adam is
[52:00] subject to the desires of his body his
[52:03] wife is subject to the desires of her
[52:05] body as well and so Adam has lost a
[52:07] level of control now in order to try and
[52:10] do what God told him to do he's still
[52:12] supposed to be fruitful in every way but
[52:15] now he's struggling to do it he's lost
[52:19] control because he took
[52:21] control Adam didn't choose to take
[52:24] control Adam wasn't looking to take
[52:26] control but when he willingly went
[52:28] against the word of God in effect what
[52:30] he did was he took away the power of God
[52:32] and he had to put his own power in its
[52:33] place and that has led to every failure
[52:36] that we have today and so after the the
[52:39] the fall Adam is going to struggle to
[52:41] produce fruit he's going to struggle to
[52:43] survive he's going to struggle to
[52:44] control his domain and all day every day
[52:48] for the rest of his far shortened life
[52:50] he is going to struggle to produce fruit
[52:53] and if he fails people die if he fails
[52:57] his family's going to die that sounds
[52:58] Grim but that's literally the way it is
[53:00] you know we've we've lost the idea to
[53:02] even comprehend how somebody could die
[53:04] of starvation today because we listen we
[53:07] get we get apples in the middle of
[53:09] winter we can get bananas and
[53:11] blueberries in the middle of the winter
[53:13] we don't comprehend that if you didn't
[53:15] plant and harvest blueberries in the
[53:17] spring and the summer then you weren't
[53:18] going to get them in the winter and if
[53:20] you didn't raise your cows and plant
[53:22] your corn and and hunt and fish and do
[53:24] all these things you died
[53:27] but that's the way it used to be now
[53:29] we've lost that sort of thing amen but
[53:31] if Adam fails in his fruit producing his
[53:35] family dies and he dies with them and
[53:37] it's a serious thing now to not be
[53:39] fruitful and it can happen at the drop
[53:41] of a hat Adam could do everything right
[53:43] he could plant his crops he could weed
[53:45] the ground he could he could set up uh
[53:47] dikes to hold the water and these
[53:49] different things but all it took was
[53:51] just one big infestation of insects and
[53:54] he'd lose his crops he could have a hail
[53:56] stomm and it could wipe out everything
[53:58] that he had put all of his hard work
[53:59] into now he is subject to the conditions
[54:02] around him instead of the other way
[54:04] around and from that time you'll see
[54:07] that God ties His blessings to
[54:10] fruitfulness every time God says if
[54:12] you'll do what I tell you to do you will
[54:15] be fruitful and it was fruit of the uh
[54:18] of the loins it was the children that
[54:20] they would produce in those days if you
[54:22] had a lot of children you were blessed
[54:24] and it was a sign of God's blessing and
[54:26] if you didn't have children it was a
[54:27] sign of God's cursing and then if you
[54:30] had crops and things were going well
[54:31] with the farming and the ranching and
[54:33] these different things it was a sign of
[54:35] God's blessing and if you had no fruit
[54:38] it meant God wasn't with you that was
[54:40] literally the way that God set it up and
[54:42] so you can see as you go through
[54:44] Israel's times in particular they have
[54:46] the ups and the downs I was just reading
[54:48] in 2 Samuel there the other day where it
[54:50] says God sent a drought to Israel
[54:52] because of what they' done to the to the
[54:54] the giban ites I think it was they broke
[54:57] the Covenant with them and God sent a
[54:59] drought for 3 years because they
[55:01] transgressed something God withdrew the
[55:04] fruitfulness of
[55:06] them why because they were off of his
[55:08] word they done something that they they
[55:10] wouldn't but then we come to Jesus time
[55:12] and Jesus puts a real Focus now on being
[55:14] fruitful and we read this last service
[55:17] and remember he said you're going to
[55:18] produce fruit as children of God and
[55:20] they're going to produce fruit as not
[55:21] children of God and there's a difference
[55:23] in your fruit and in their fruit amen
[55:26] theirs might look a lot like yours and
[55:27] yours might look a lot like theirs but
[55:29] there's a difference and the difference
[55:31] is the same as it was supposed to be in
[55:33] the beginning which is your fruit will
[55:35] be my will by my word and theirs will be
[55:38] their will by their word it's going to
[55:42] look like the very same thing but it's
[55:44] not the same thing listen Eve had a
[55:47] Manchild didn't she and it looked just
[55:50] like a Son of God but it wasn't a Son of
[55:53] God one of them was and one of them
[55:55] wasn't
[55:57] but how did you find out who was who you
[55:59] had to look down the road when the fruit
[56:02] came when they brought their offering
[56:04] amen so it's the same as in the Garden
[56:07] of Eden today it's the same thing will
[56:09] you produce fruit by his will and his
[56:11] word or will you do it by your will and
[56:13] your word and remember we read this this
[56:15] is just setting us up this evening he
[56:17] says even so every good tree brings
[56:19] forth good fruit but a corrupt tree
[56:21] bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree
[56:23] cannot bring forth evil fruit neither
[56:25] can a corrupt tree bring forth good
[56:27] fruit every tree that bringeth not forth
[56:29] good fruit is heun down and cast Into
[56:31] the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye
[56:33] shall know them then he says not
[56:35] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[56:37] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[56:39] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[56:41] which is in heaven my will my way that's
[56:44] the way God wants it he says many will
[56:46] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[56:48] not prophesied in thy name in thy name
[56:50] cast out devils and in thy name done
[56:52] many wonderful works and then will I
[56:54] profess unto them I I never knew you
[56:57] depart from you you that work iniquity
[57:00] so they both produced fruit but what was
[57:02] the difference in their fruit the ones
[57:04] that were rejected yes it was fruit but
[57:07] it was completely outside the will of
[57:09] God and to a greater point they denied
[57:12] the will of God so they could do their
[57:14] own thing that was the difference in the
[57:16] two two fruits one was outside the will
[57:18] the word and the revelation of God
[57:20] completely outside the plan of God it
[57:21] was their fruit not God's fruit and then
[57:24] Jesus would come down on this thought on
[57:25] fruit in Matthew and he would preach the
[57:27] parable of the S and that's really where
[57:29] I want to want to spend my time here
[57:31] tonight if it's if it would be the
[57:33] leading of the Lord here because he
[57:35] would talk about a child of God
[57:36] producing out of their life and in
[57:39] Matthew 13 he says he spake many things
[57:41] unto them in Parables saying Behold a
[57:43] swer went forth to sow and when he sowed
[57:46] some seeds fell by the wayside and the
[57:48] fowls came and devoured them up some
[57:51] fell upon Stony places where they had
[57:53] not much Earth and forth with they
[57:55] sprung up because they had no deepness
[57:57] of Earth you'll notice the fastest ones
[57:59] to spring up are not the ones that are
[58:01] going to
[58:02] live flash in the pan we used to call it
[58:05] he says and when the sun was
[58:08] up they were scorched because they had
[58:10] no root they withered away and some fell
[58:13] among thorns and the Thorns sprung up
[58:15] and choked them but other fell into good
[58:17] ground and brought forth fruit some 100
[58:20] fold some 60 fold some 30 fold and then
[58:24] he says he who have ears let him hear
[58:26] now there's one thing that I that jumped
[58:28] out to me as I was reading this and
[58:30] that's that I don't want to be
[58:31] identified with anything before verse
[58:33] 8 I don't want to have anything to do
[58:36] with that those are the ones that don't
[58:37] make it those are the ones that have no
[58:39] purpose those are the ones that don't do
[58:41] any good even though they start in some
[58:44] cases they never finish the race they
[58:46] never come to their purpose amen I don't
[58:49] want to be eaten by birds I don't want
[58:51] to get scorched out I don't want to die
[58:53] because something chokes me out I think
[58:56] choking got to be about the most
[58:57] miserable way to die because you know
[58:58] you're dying and you can't do anything
[59:00] about it until things fade out but then
[59:03] I came to verse eight and you know what
[59:05] I don't want to be anything less than
[59:07] the H
[59:08] hundredfold does anybody here tonight
[59:11] say you know what brother John I'm okay
[59:14] if everybody else produces more fruit of
[59:16] the spirit than I do is anybody here
[59:19] saying you know what I'm okay with
[59:22] 30 I don't believe that ought to be the
[59:25] way that a Believer looks things I don't
[59:27] want to just slide into heaven barely
[59:29] making it with the bare minimum that a
[59:31] Christian can do I don't believe that's
[59:33] what we're supposed to be doing amen
[59:35] nobody truly wants to be
[59:38] last nobody wants to be the Lesser if
[59:41] God places Us in that position that's
[59:43] one thing but I don't think anybody
[59:45] sitting here saying I just want to be
[59:47] the last I don't want to be recognized
[59:49] as anything greater than anybody else I
[59:51] I don't want to have anything more than
[59:53] what I
[59:55] have we look at our life the question is
[59:58] does it scream hundredfold 60-fold or
[1:00:00] 30-fold though because remember what
[1:00:03] what Jesus said to the disciples he said
[1:00:04] the spirit is willing but the flesh is
[1:00:06] weak and when I look at my life see I
[1:00:08] can say here real easy it's real easy
[1:00:11] for me to say I want to be a h
[1:00:12] hundredfold Christian but when I look at
[1:00:15] my life then what do my decisions look
[1:00:17] like are they saying this is a man that
[1:00:19] wants to have a h hundredfold of the
[1:00:20] fruit of the spirit in his life or is he
[1:00:23] kind of middle of the pack 60-fold or is
[1:00:25] he barely scraping through with 30-fold
[1:00:28] in his
[1:00:30] life the desires are strong where's the
[1:00:34] will where's the power in these things
[1:00:37] because if we want a great harvest of
[1:00:39] hfold that means there's got to be
[1:00:41] something that goes into produce
[1:00:42] 100-fold that's different than what goes
[1:00:44] into the 30 that's different than goes
[1:00:46] into the 60 and I'm not putting this on
[1:00:48] ourselves this evening but there are
[1:00:50] things we can do and we'll see that as
[1:00:52] we go through it but remember what Moses
[1:00:54] would say he says Thou shalt love the
[1:00:56] Lord thy God with all thine heart with
[1:00:59] all thy soul and with all thy
[1:01:02] might and then in Ecclesiastes it would
[1:01:05] say whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do
[1:01:08] it with thy might in other words give it
[1:01:12] give her all you got don't just stand
[1:01:15] there and say I tried
[1:01:17] once don't just stand there and say well
[1:01:20] I've done enough for God don't just
[1:01:23] stand there and say I've done more than
[1:01:25] than him or her next to me he says
[1:01:28] whatever you got give it give him
[1:01:31] everything you got put everything you've
[1:01:33] got into it now church if I'm doing
[1:01:36] everything that I possibly can and I
[1:01:38] only produce 30 fold then so what I know
[1:01:42] I've given it my all but if I'm
[1:01:44] producing 30-fold and I'm barely bumping
[1:01:47] along guess what there's a problem with
[1:01:50] this man's
[1:01:51] attitude we ought not to be sitting here
[1:01:53] and saying I've done the bare minimum
[1:01:56] I'm okay with just seeing a little bit
[1:01:57] of God and so if there's anything I can
[1:02:00] do to take me from a 30-fold to a
[1:02:02] 60-fold or 100-fold I would say Lord
[1:02:04] help me to do that because I want to be
[1:02:06] a Christian that's serving you with all
[1:02:08] of my heart my soul and my mind and with
[1:02:10] all my strength amen but I'm here to
[1:02:13] tell you there are things that we can do
[1:02:15] and I'll give you the answer in the very
[1:02:16] end of this service if you'll stick with
[1:02:18] me I'll give you what we can do because
[1:02:21] there there are things we can do that
[1:02:23] will just absolutely magnify the effect
[1:02:26] of God inside of our life and it comes
[1:02:28] from being an understanding of what
[1:02:30] makes it fruitful but if we look at
[1:02:32] those verses uh 3 through 7 that we read
[1:02:35] there and then the verse eight what's
[1:02:37] the difference in verse eight are there
[1:02:38] Birds we don't know if there are birds
[1:02:41] or not all we know is they don't have an
[1:02:43] effect but we know there's no thorns and
[1:02:45] thistles there we know there's no rocks
[1:02:47] in there there's something different
[1:02:49] about the ground in verse 8 and it's
[1:02:50] because the scripture says it's good
[1:02:52] ground there's a difference between
[1:02:54] those things amen the ground that
[1:02:56] produces a harvest has been prepared and
[1:03:00] protected you'll see in those old days
[1:03:03] see when they when they put the the seed
[1:03:05] down they would put a net down as well
[1:03:09] and they put up uh scarecrows and they
[1:03:11] put up things that would would flash and
[1:03:13] tinkle and make sounds to scare away the
[1:03:16] birds but on the side of the road and
[1:03:19] where the ground isn't prepared they
[1:03:20] don't try and scare the birds away cuz
[1:03:23] that's not meant to
[1:03:24] produce the good ground it's not that it
[1:03:27] never had rocks it's that the rocks have
[1:03:30] been removed you go look in this world
[1:03:32] there ain't no place where the ground is
[1:03:34] perfect from the start you've got to do
[1:03:36] something to it amen it's not that the
[1:03:38] ground never had Thorns or thistles but
[1:03:41] those have been removed they've been
[1:03:42] plowed under good ground isn't always
[1:03:45] good ground but there's a work that's
[1:03:47] been done to make it good ground and
[1:03:49] that's the difference between those
[1:03:50] things a farmer that wants good ground
[1:03:53] has to do a lot of work before it
[1:03:54] becomes good ground
[1:03:56] you know here in newf land you know the
[1:03:57] best thing we
[1:03:59] grow rocks that's right sister Brenda
[1:04:02] the best thing we grow nobody grows
[1:04:04] rocks like we do in in New Finland and I
[1:04:06] remember when we used to live in
[1:04:07] killbride and sometimes we'd drive down
[1:04:09] into the gouls and you'd see the farmers
[1:04:11] there in the spring and what do they
[1:04:13] have there every
[1:04:14] spring theyve got a rock pile in the old
[1:04:17] day us to see the pictures they'd have a
[1:04:19] horse hooked up to a sledge and they'd
[1:04:21] be throwing the rocks that grew through
[1:04:23] the winter
[1:04:25] all it is it's just the Frost takes it
[1:04:27] and it pushes it up is what's happening
[1:04:28] okay they're not growing rocks we know
[1:04:30] this but what are they doing they're
[1:04:32] taking Rocky ground and they're turning
[1:04:35] it into good ground but it takes work it
[1:04:38] takes effort there's a lot of Sweat
[1:04:40] Equity that they have to put into this
[1:04:42] amen and then when those rocks are out
[1:04:44] now they can start using the real tools
[1:04:47] which is the plows because when the
[1:04:48] springtime
[1:04:50] comes you know if you've ever looked at
[1:04:52] your lawn anybody looked at their lawn
[1:04:54] right now doesn't have a lot of grass in
[1:04:57] it for most of us brother Bob's old La
[1:05:00] would still have grass and brother Marx
[1:05:01] would have grass mine is mostly moss and
[1:05:05] clover and some other ragged
[1:05:08] weeds but when you come to the spring
[1:05:10] the first thing that grows is not the
[1:05:13] grass is it church it's everything but
[1:05:15] the grass and so these farmers are no
[1:05:18] different in our lives are no different
[1:05:20] when you're getting ready to turn it
[1:05:22] into good ground there's going to be
[1:05:23] lots of stuff that will take away your
[1:05:25] nutrients and take away what you put
[1:05:27] into that ground if you don't flip it
[1:05:30] and so they'll come into these fields
[1:05:32] and they'll take a plow and what the
[1:05:34] plow does is it takes what's deep in the
[1:05:36] Earth where all the nutrients are where
[1:05:38] all of the rottenness was and all the
[1:05:40] everything is gathered there that's the
[1:05:41] good stuff and it brings it to the top
[1:05:44] and what it does is it takes the nasty
[1:05:46] stuff on top and it buries it down below
[1:05:49] where it can't live
[1:05:50] anymore and that's what turns the ground
[1:05:53] into good ground it's not that it never
[1:05:55] had the thorns and the briers and the
[1:05:57] and the weeds and these different things
[1:05:59] but they plow the field so that the bad
[1:06:01] stuff is buried and it's ready for the
[1:06:03] good stuff up on top but I want to take
[1:06:06] us back to what Jesus says about this
[1:06:08] ground in Matthew because he says these
[1:06:10] words he says for this people's heart
[1:06:12] he's talking about they said why do you
[1:06:14] talk in Parables why why don't you just
[1:06:16] tell them what they
[1:06:18] mean he said for this people's heart is
[1:06:20] waxed gross and their ears are dull of
[1:06:23] hearing and their eyes they have closed
[1:06:26] lest at any time they should see with
[1:06:28] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[1:06:30] should understand with their heart and
[1:06:31] should be converted and I should heal
[1:06:33] them he says but blessed are your eyes
[1:06:35] for they see and your ears for they hear
[1:06:38] Church what's one thing we can't change
[1:06:41] who hears it and who
[1:06:43] doesn't just because you're born into a
[1:06:45] message family doesn't mean that you get
[1:06:46] to hear it it's that's the Sovereign
[1:06:49] predestination of God that you can hear
[1:06:51] the word you can understand it you can
[1:06:54] accept it and you can become it you can
[1:06:55] unify with it that's God's choosing that
[1:06:58] was chosen way before I ever took a
[1:07:00] breath of life and you as well he says
[1:07:02] for verily I say unto you that many
[1:07:04] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:07:06] to see those things which you see and
[1:07:08] have not seen them and to hear those
[1:07:10] things which you hear and have not heard
[1:07:12] them and so we're privileged this
[1:07:14] morning they were privileged then and we
[1:07:15] have been ever since that our experience
[1:07:18] in the Gospel of Jesus Christ the
[1:07:20] baptism of the Holy Spirit the the the
[1:07:22] coming of the New Covenant the New
[1:07:24] Testament is something that they were
[1:07:26] all looking forward to and never got one
[1:07:30] of the greatest men in the scriptures
[1:07:31] David David never got to see what you
[1:07:34] you see this morning if you've rece this
[1:07:36] evening if you've received the Holy
[1:07:37] Spirit if you're sitting under this New
[1:07:39] Covenant that's what David was looking
[1:07:41] for what you have is what David wanted
[1:07:44] what you have is what Samuel wanted what
[1:07:46] you have is what Moses was looking for
[1:07:48] what Joseph was looking for these great
[1:07:50] men and the other great Women of Faith
[1:07:52] Sarah and Rahab and Rebecca and all
[1:07:54] these different ones they were looking
[1:07:56] for this in Hebrews 11 says they
[1:07:58] received the promises but they didn't
[1:07:59] receive the full promise we're sitting
[1:08:01] under the Full Gospel the full promise
[1:08:03] of Christ they didn't receive it but we
[1:08:07] receive it and when we come into
[1:08:08] maturity it actually brings them into
[1:08:10] Perfection it brings the whole body of
[1:08:12] Christ together and we're joined into
[1:08:13] that body they're looking for what we
[1:08:17] have and so we're sitting here and Jesus
[1:08:19] says hear ye therefore the parable of
[1:08:20] the
[1:08:21] S when anyone heareth the word of the
[1:08:24] Kingdom and understandeth it not then
[1:08:28] cometh the wicked one and catcheth away
[1:08:30] that which was sown in his heart this is
[1:08:32] he which receive see by the way so this
[1:08:35] is a clear element of predestination
[1:08:36] those in verse 19 they are not
[1:08:38] predestinated to hear you can't make
[1:08:41] yourself good ground if you're on the
[1:08:43] Wayside you weren't
[1:08:45] chosen that's hard but it's true amen if
[1:08:48] you're of God you'd hear the word if
[1:08:50] you're of the devil you won't Jesus made
[1:08:52] that very clear it's not our choice it's
[1:08:53] his choice then in verse 20 says says
[1:08:55] but he that received the seed into Stony
[1:08:57] places the same as he that heareth the
[1:08:59] word and a nom with joy received it now
[1:09:02] this one's tricky because this is a
[1:09:04] person that seems to receive it but in
[1:09:07] time it's revealed that they didn't they
[1:09:10] love the word outwardly they love to
[1:09:11] hear it they love to say Amen but
[1:09:13] there's rocks all through their life and
[1:09:15] they've got things all over their life
[1:09:17] that hinder the growth and you'll notice
[1:09:19] it's the Rocks below the
[1:09:21] surface they can only grow down a little
[1:09:24] bit and then they hit something that
[1:09:25] they can't dig
[1:09:27] into he says yet he ha not root in
[1:09:30] himself but Urth he he lasts he endures
[1:09:33] for a while for when tribulation or
[1:09:35] persecution arises because of the word
[1:09:38] by and by He Is offended remember Jesus
[1:09:40] talked about the Paul really talked
[1:09:43] about it being a rock of offense and a
[1:09:45] stumbling block and this is the person
[1:09:47] that loved the idea when they heard it
[1:09:50] it's like we see in Revelation 108 when
[1:09:52] John took the book it's sweet in the
[1:09:53] mouth but it's bitter in the belly and
[1:09:55] when it gets bitter in the belly what do
[1:09:56] they do they vomit it up they don't want
[1:09:58] any part of it they love the
[1:10:01] services but they can't live what they
[1:10:03] hear they love special meetings but they
[1:10:07] can't ever get the victory see they can
[1:10:09] rejoice in the moment but they can't
[1:10:11] last the journey they can't come to a
[1:10:13] harvest condition amen and so when
[1:10:16] things get hard when things get rough
[1:10:17] when offenses come when separation
[1:10:19] persecution whatever it might be
[1:10:21] criticism the cost of the gospel hits
[1:10:24] them they say sorry that's not for me
[1:10:25] and they they Bend and they break and
[1:10:27] they fall
[1:10:28] away he says then he also that receives
[1:10:31] seed among the Thorns is he that heareth
[1:10:33] the word and the care of this world and
[1:10:37] the deceitfulness of riches choke the
[1:10:39] word and he becomes unfruitful now
[1:10:41] notice he hears the word and this is the
[1:10:43] most deceiving of all of them amen
[1:10:45] what's holding back the fruit cuz he
[1:10:47] hears it and there is a life that grows
[1:10:52] here it grows up tall enough to be
[1:10:54] choked out it lives for a while and it
[1:10:57] says here what is it that that that
[1:10:59] chokes it out he says it's the cares of
[1:11:01] the world when you go back to the
[1:11:02] original language it says the anxieties
[1:11:05] and worries of this present
[1:11:08] age so in other words they've divided
[1:11:10] their focus between the word and the
[1:11:13] world remember what Jesus says you can't
[1:11:15] serve two masters and when you're
[1:11:18] divided like that you're a double-minded
[1:11:20] man you you're unstable in all your ways
[1:11:22] and what happens is you've got to pick
[1:11:24] one and in the end these types of people
[1:11:27] what happens is the world wins amen you
[1:11:30] can't serve two masters one's going to
[1:11:31] take it and these are ones that have a
[1:11:33] priority for the things of the world so
[1:11:36] these are ones that are overcome with
[1:11:38] the
[1:11:39] anxieties but then it also says the
[1:11:42] deceitfulness of
[1:11:44] riches they choke the word and he
[1:11:47] becomes unfruitful so so these are
[1:11:48] people on two different sides of the
[1:11:51] spectrum if we want to put it that way
[1:11:53] You' got one that's got so many
[1:11:56] needs that they can't remember they're a
[1:11:59] child of God and you got one that's got
[1:12:02] so many blessings that they've forgotten
[1:12:05] they're a child of God you got one that
[1:12:08] has so many needs and he's so wrapped up
[1:12:10] in himself that he's forgotten about
[1:12:12] Jehovah Gyra and then you've got one
[1:12:14] that's so blessed that he's forgotten
[1:12:16] I've got Jehovah
[1:12:18] Gyra they're on the the two extremes of
[1:12:21] of those things amen but this is one of
[1:12:24] those things
[1:12:25] and and I'm going to clarify this
[1:12:26] statement in just a moment if you'll
[1:12:28] grant me that Grace we can control where
[1:12:30] our anxieties are we can control where
[1:12:33] our cares are we can control where our
[1:12:36] time is we can control where our focus
[1:12:38] is we can control what our priority is
[1:12:41] absolutely as Believers because Satan
[1:12:43] can get us so wrapped up in what we need
[1:12:47] and what has to happen and we can get
[1:12:49] caught up in budgeting and the next
[1:12:51] thing and the next thing and the next
[1:12:53] thing and pretty soon we've completely
[1:12:54] forgotten that he's the man he's a God
[1:12:57] that owns the cattle on a thousand hills
[1:12:59] that the scripture says casting all your
[1:13:01] cares upon Him for he carth for you
[1:13:05] we're not meant to Bear those that way
[1:13:08] we're supposed to lay it on him and when
[1:13:10] we do that then we can produce fruit but
[1:13:13] if all we're trying to do is bear the
[1:13:14] load ourselves then what happens is we
[1:13:16] never produce the
[1:13:18] fruit but we can get caught up and this
[1:13:20] is really the danger in leoa I find is
[1:13:23] that we can have so much
[1:13:26] that we can declare like they did we're
[1:13:29] rich and increased with goods and have
[1:13:30] need of nothing and God is nowhere to be
[1:13:33] found in our life we are so easy in our
[1:13:38] life things are so simple I don't
[1:13:40] believe life's really easy but hey we're
[1:13:43] in North America we're in a in a tier
[1:13:45] one country we're a first world country
[1:13:49] compared to a lot of this world we've
[1:13:50] got it really easy you go to India you
[1:13:53] go to Africa you go to South America you
[1:13:55] see what those Believers have church you
[1:13:57] talk about anxieties and cares we don't
[1:13:58] have that here we don't have to have
[1:14:01] those things there
[1:14:02] amen but these are two sides that forget
[1:14:06] that they're children they should be
[1:14:08] children of
[1:14:09] God but I want to say it this way and
[1:14:12] this where the clarification is in verse
[1:14:14] 23 they are not children of God
[1:14:17] absolutely not we know that good ground
[1:14:19] is predestinated by God good ground
[1:14:22] represents a child of God and we're
[1:14:24] going to be mixing our metaphors a
[1:14:25] little bit here because we we are
[1:14:27] looking at the good ground and in this
[1:14:29] Parable the good ground is you and I
[1:14:32] it's people and out of our good ground
[1:14:34] out of our Lives comes something that
[1:14:36] produces a harvest amen but we know that
[1:14:39] that good ground is predestinated by God
[1:14:41] we look at the first one it was ground
[1:14:43] on the side of the road they never
[1:14:44] understood the word of God Jesus said if
[1:14:46] you were of your father you would hear
[1:14:48] my word and you'd understand it so
[1:14:50] they're not even in the plan of God then
[1:14:52] the Stony ground here's the word
[1:14:53] joyfully
[1:14:55] but it doesn't do
[1:14:57] anything tickles their fancy but it
[1:14:59] doesn't rest in their soul this is an
[1:15:01] emotional or an intellectual believer
[1:15:04] they're caught up in the feeling or the
[1:15:06] thought of it all but there's no
[1:15:07] strength or anchor there and then we go
[1:15:08] to the thorny ground and the thorny
[1:15:10] ground hears the word and starts to
[1:15:13] grow justification
[1:15:16] sanctification but when it comes to
[1:15:17] producing fruit that's when they fall
[1:15:20] and you can put somebody like Judas
[1:15:22] right there came all the way up but just
[1:15:25] couldn't come to the fruit
[1:15:26] park that's what it can look like but it
[1:15:29] can look like a Pharisee it can look
[1:15:31] like a pretended brother in these
[1:15:32] different things so it holds on to the
[1:15:34] word long enough but it can't produce
[1:15:36] the word and brother Brown would say the
[1:15:38] only thing that can't produce itself is
[1:15:40] something in a hybrid
[1:15:42] condition and so you've got something
[1:15:44] that's Blended in there and that's
[1:15:45] what's the hindrance is that in the end
[1:15:47] they weren't in there they there was no
[1:15:49] life in them to begin with but they
[1:15:51] can't produce fruit and it dies away
[1:15:53] because they become intain entangle with
[1:15:55] the word they can't come to maturity but
[1:15:58] then we come to our scripture in verse
[1:15:59] 23 it says but he that receives seed
[1:16:02] into the good ground is he so the good
[1:16:06] ground is us is he that heard the word
[1:16:08] now remember the thorny ground heard the
[1:16:10] word but it's he that heareth the word
[1:16:13] and understandeth it which also beareth
[1:16:16] fruit and bringeth forth some
[1:16:18] hundredfold some 60 and some 30 and
[1:16:21] we've already preached on this only one
[1:16:22] person can hear the word and that's a
[1:16:24] child of God
[1:16:25] that's why I say good ground is
[1:16:27] predestinated but it's also why I'm
[1:16:29] saying good ground requires a work it
[1:16:33] requires a work and if we look at at the
[1:16:35] good ground as our own lives then I
[1:16:37] believe we can see that there is a
[1:16:39] working of God and in church there's a
[1:16:41] working of us as well absolutely that's
[1:16:43] going to keep us in a place where we can
[1:16:45] produce it you know when the gospels
[1:16:48] emphasiz when Jesus is talking about
[1:16:50] here the as soon as he says this Parable
[1:16:53] the disciples don't understand it and
[1:16:55] it's only after he explains it that they
[1:16:57] sort of understand it but time and time
[1:16:59] again we see in the gospels that Jesus
[1:17:01] would say something and he would even
[1:17:03] tell them and they still wouldn't
[1:17:06] understand but yet it was given to them
[1:17:08] to understand but what was it going to
[1:17:10] take to make them understand it was
[1:17:11] going to take an upper room experience
[1:17:14] it was going to take the baptism of the
[1:17:15] Holy Spirit brother BR would say Peter
[1:17:17] became an inspired preacher on the day
[1:17:20] of Pentecost and now Peter can come and
[1:17:22] he can write these beautiful things that
[1:17:23] we've been reading Paul can come behind
[1:17:25] it and John and these different ones
[1:17:27] when the Holy Spirit comes he's now
[1:17:29] opening up their eyes of understanding
[1:17:31] and Revelation and that's when they
[1:17:33] start to produce fruit CU they can
[1:17:36] understand it they've been hearing it
[1:17:38] for three and a half years under Jesus
[1:17:40] direct Ministry but now they have to
[1:17:42] come into a place where there's a birth
[1:17:44] and they can start to produce these
[1:17:46] things it's leading them into all truth
[1:17:48] now we read this quote near the end of
[1:17:50] last service and I want to read it again
[1:17:51] as we push forward into the last half of
[1:17:53] this service this evening brother R says
[1:17:55] we are not of this world there is
[1:17:59] nothing about the way we live the way we
[1:18:01] function our priorities none of that is
[1:18:03] going to match up with what this world
[1:18:05] thinks we should do we are crazy but
[1:18:08] I'll tell you this there are people that
[1:18:11] are starting to wake up to the way that
[1:18:14] this craziness
[1:18:15] works but the thing is 99% of them will
[1:18:19] recognize it too
[1:18:20] late but I can't tell you how many times
[1:18:23] I've talked to people at work and
[1:18:25] clients and these different things and
[1:18:27] they know of course most of them do that
[1:18:29] I'm a Christian many of them know I'm a
[1:18:31] a minister and a pastor and these
[1:18:33] different things and they they just say
[1:18:35] how do you do this and how do you do
[1:18:37] that and how's it working out and how's
[1:18:39] it doing this and my kids are doing this
[1:18:41] and my kids are doing that are your kids
[1:18:42] doing this are your kids doing that and
[1:18:44] I say no we don't have any problems like
[1:18:46] that I have perfect
[1:18:49] children no I don't say
[1:18:52] that but I say no we don't have that
[1:18:56] issue we don't have that issue and I
[1:18:59] tell them what we do to keep from having
[1:19:01] that
[1:19:02] issue but they just can't comprehend it
[1:19:05] because they're so stuck on rights and
[1:19:07] their own morality and their own ideas
[1:19:10] and their own intellectuality I work
[1:19:11] with some pretty smart people you try
[1:19:14] and convince a smart person that
[1:19:15] everything they believed is wrong that's
[1:19:18] real hard but when they see the system
[1:19:21] not working when they see what they're
[1:19:22] doing not working that's when when you
[1:19:24] have a very small opening to say I know
[1:19:27] of a different way and you might think
[1:19:29] it's crazy but it's worked and it's been
[1:19:31] proven for thousands and thousands of
[1:19:35] years but it's a way that's called
[1:19:37] heresy
[1:19:39] unfortunately right you're going to have
[1:19:41] to stand out if you want different
[1:19:43] results you're going to have to do it
[1:19:44] different than everybody else that's not
[1:19:45] getting the results you like otherwise
[1:19:47] you're just part of the same system he
[1:19:49] says we are different from the world we
[1:19:51] live a different life a separated life
[1:19:54] we're never to live the life of the
[1:19:55] world and be a Christian we're to live
[1:19:58] an outstanding life a different life not
[1:20:01] in such social ranks but I mean we are
[1:20:03] to live a life of the genuine Holiness
[1:20:05] that the fruits of the spirit might be
[1:20:07] seen in US of meekness gentleness
[1:20:10] patience longsuffering Faith the fruit
[1:20:12] of the spirit so what is a life of
[1:20:14] Holiness a life of Holiness is a life
[1:20:16] that's cleaned
[1:20:17] up it's a life that's prepared for God
[1:20:21] it's good ground if we could put it that
[1:20:23] way amen so when we look through this
[1:20:26] Parable what we see are constant
[1:20:30] hindrances hindrances of birds
[1:20:33] hindrances of rocks hindrances of things
[1:20:36] that not to be there that come and choke
[1:20:38] out the life amen all of those things
[1:20:40] are there and some of them we can't help
[1:20:44] and some of them we can listen I can't
[1:20:47] stop the birds from
[1:20:49] existing but I can stop them from living
[1:20:51] in my house absolutely
[1:20:55] rocks as they come up I can either get
[1:20:57] rid of them or I can leave them and as
[1:21:00] we'll get into sometimes I'm the one
[1:21:02] that's walking over and I'm taking a
[1:21:04] rock off the side of the road and I'm
[1:21:06] dropping it right into my own field by
[1:21:09] my own choices every single day amen
[1:21:12] I've got the Holy Spirit and you've got
[1:21:14] the Holy Spirit to highlight when a
[1:21:16] hindrance hits your life so that you can
[1:21:19] see this ain't going to help me produce
[1:21:22] my 30-fold 60-fold or 100 fold
[1:21:25] and then once he highlights it once he
[1:21:26] shows it to me then I've got a choice do
[1:21:29] I really want to get rid of it or do I
[1:21:32] want to allow the hindrance to stay in
[1:21:33] my life look what Paul said to the
[1:21:35] Galatians you did run well you were
[1:21:38] growing great you were doing such a good
[1:21:41] job look how fast you are
[1:21:44] growing who did hinder you that you
[1:21:47] should not obey the truth this
[1:21:49] persuasion cometh not of him that
[1:21:51] calleth you it's not God that's doing
[1:21:53] this God is Not here to hinder growth
[1:21:56] I've repeated that thing that I got from
[1:21:57] Brother Eugene Braun and I I I truly
[1:22:00] appreciate it it's a principle that
[1:22:02] stuck with me and that's that God's love
[1:22:04] is based on spiritual
[1:22:06] growth that's what God wants out of us
[1:22:09] spiritual growth he doesn't care about
[1:22:11] our health if we're failing in our
[1:22:13] Christian walk he doesn't care about our
[1:22:15] finances if we're failing in our
[1:22:16] Christian walk he doesn't care about our
[1:22:18] career if we're failing in our Christian
[1:22:19] walk he will wipe everything out to get
[1:22:22] us to grow as a child of God
[1:22:25] but then Paul says this little phrase he
[1:22:27] says a little leaven lenth the whole
[1:22:30] lump that's a tongue
[1:22:32] twister sometimes we have to be honest
[1:22:35] and say this one ain't on Satan this
[1:22:39] one's on
[1:22:40] me we've got to have that honest
[1:22:42] conversation sometimes it's not that the
[1:22:44] hindrance is there it's that I'm either
[1:22:46] allowing it or even creating it in my
[1:22:49] own life listen we're all inclined to
[1:22:52] certain things we all have weaknesses we
[1:22:54] have areas that we need to keep covered
[1:22:55] up by prayer and sometimes we don't
[1:22:57] cover them up by prayer sometimes we get
[1:22:59] into situations and we've got to be able
[1:23:01] to see those things and recognize them
[1:23:03] for what they
[1:23:06] are but I'm wanting us to be aware even
[1:23:09] this evening that we can limit the power
[1:23:12] of those things in our life not me as a
[1:23:15] person that's the work of the Holy
[1:23:17] Spirit but I have that choice to decide
[1:23:20] am I going to go with him and go with
[1:23:22] the word or am I going to insist on
[1:23:24] allowing this hindrance in my life have
[1:23:26] you ever seen a picture of a field where
[1:23:28] they didn't get the rocks
[1:23:29] out sometimes they've got one big rock
[1:23:31] there and every Row in that field is
[1:23:35] straight to a point and then they come
[1:23:37] to this rock and they've got to go
[1:23:39] around it and you know what it does to
[1:23:41] every single row after that church it
[1:23:44] puts a kink in every single
[1:23:48] row this is what Paul says a little tiny
[1:23:52] hindrance has a ripple effect through
[1:23:54] your entire
[1:23:57] life I'm not a legalistic preacher but
[1:23:59] I'm preaching what Paul said here he's
[1:24:01] saying you got some problems and it's
[1:24:04] the little things that are causing the
[1:24:06] big things
[1:24:08] amen that little thing can spread out
[1:24:12] and affect your entire
[1:24:14] life so can I share something with you
[1:24:16] tonight I'm going to be open and
[1:24:19] honest not about
[1:24:21] you couple nervous faces there
[1:24:25] I'm going to be honest about
[1:24:27] me because if we can be honest about me
[1:24:29] then we ought to be able to be honest
[1:24:30] with you amen this is going out on the
[1:24:34] internet but can we start with this
[1:24:36] place and say I don't want a hindrance
[1:24:38] in my life would that be our desire this
[1:24:40] evening I don't want a hindrance in my
[1:24:42] life that's what my heart's desire is
[1:24:45] amen so my wife and I we purchased a new
[1:24:48] mattress in April of last year from
[1:24:51] Costco highly rated got a good deal on
[1:24:53] it
[1:24:54] and we put it in our house and for the
[1:24:56] first while it was wonderful absolutely
[1:24:59] wonderful great support we had great
[1:25:01] sleep but over time we started to not
[1:25:04] sleep so well our backs started to hurt
[1:25:07] these different things and then my wife
[1:25:09] said she says these things have they've
[1:25:11] got a dip in them I'm like no they don't
[1:25:12] they don't I they don't I refuse to
[1:25:15] believe it but sure enough she was right
[1:25:18] and eventually I saw the dips were there
[1:25:20] we flipped the mattress like we were
[1:25:21] supposed to do you know and didn't
[1:25:23] matter they veloped the new dip where we
[1:25:25] were sleeping and so what do you what
[1:25:26] are you going to do well we' got we're
[1:25:29] we're looking for a new mattress in the
[1:25:31] meantime but we haven't found one yet
[1:25:32] but downstairs we have our old mattress
[1:25:34] that we bought
[1:25:36] 23 years ago and it's still going strong
[1:25:40] great mattress but it's a queen and we
[1:25:42] have a king bed now so we can't just
[1:25:45] take that one upstairs and put it on our
[1:25:46] bed so sometimes if our backs are
[1:25:49] particularly bad my wife or I will go
[1:25:51] and sleep downstairs somebody needs to
[1:25:52] stay up just in case our young wakes up
[1:25:56] and so the other night she decided
[1:25:59] Samuel was sick and so she said well I'm
[1:26:00] going to stay up here and you go down
[1:26:02] and sleep on that bed if you want your
[1:26:04] back to feel better and so what I did is
[1:26:06] I picked up my iPad and I was going out
[1:26:09] the door and she said don't stay up
[1:26:12] late and I said I
[1:26:15] won't but I've been reading something
[1:26:18] and I wanted to finish what I was
[1:26:19] reading so I went downstairs and guess
[1:26:22] what I did I said stayed up
[1:26:25] late way late
[1:26:28] 11:38
[1:26:30] p.m. okay I was only going to be 10
[1:26:32] minutes the spirit's
[1:26:35] willing the iPad is
[1:26:37] weak no no the iPad's not weak John's
[1:26:41] weak and what happens I got sucked into
[1:26:43] the next thing and I look oh I got to
[1:26:45] check this what I started pulling on a
[1:26:48] thread and I followed it to the ends of
[1:26:50] the universe for the next hour I needed
[1:26:53] to go to bed I needed that sleep but I'm
[1:26:57] down
[1:26:58] there and what do I do now I go to bed
[1:27:01] late so when I wake up the next morning
[1:27:04] of course I'm feeling the best aren't I
[1:27:06] I'm well rested chipper no tired little
[1:27:12] bit grumpy a little bit
[1:27:15] angry at this guy for letting me down
[1:27:19] cuz it wasn't my intention to do it but
[1:27:22] now I wake up I don't get up when I
[1:27:24] should so now I'm late for my devotions
[1:27:27] so I cut my devotion
[1:27:29] short I'm I'm not feeling the best and
[1:27:32] so now that bleeds into my
[1:27:35] attitude bleeds into how I deal with my
[1:27:37] family deals how I deal with my
[1:27:39] clients I'm supposed to be studying the
[1:27:41] word of God and what is it I'm tired way
[1:27:44] before I need to be tired because what
[1:27:47] this
[1:27:49] guy who has no affiliation with
[1:27:52] me this guy decided that he wanted to
[1:27:55] pull on a thread until he found the end
[1:27:57] of the
[1:27:57] universe
[1:28:01] right it's not wrong it's a
[1:28:05] hindrance it's a hindrance right there's
[1:28:08] nothing wrong with me sitting on my iPad
[1:28:10] and to be fair most times when I'm on my
[1:28:12] iPad I have my wife in the room because
[1:28:14] she'll turn over and tell me when to go
[1:28:16] to
[1:28:17] bed it's a check it's a balance but when
[1:28:21] I'm down there nobody can tell me what
[1:28:22] to do right right and so what happens is
[1:28:25] this flesh tells me what to
[1:28:29] do so whose fault is it that I sleep in
[1:28:31] late that I shorten my devotions that
[1:28:34] I'm a little bit grumpy for the rest of
[1:28:36] that day that I've got to try and catch
[1:28:37] up on my sleep the next
[1:28:39] night that's not Satan's fault that's
[1:28:42] this guy's
[1:28:44] fault I picked up the iPad and gave it a
[1:28:47] preeminence in my life that night
[1:28:51] amen so what do I do from now on church
[1:28:55] if I'm going to go sleep downstairs
[1:28:57] where's the iPad going not with this guy
[1:29:00] not with this guy because he's proven he
[1:29:03] likes that
[1:29:04] hindrance and this my my life my
[1:29:08] Ministry my family can't afford that
[1:29:10] hindrance so the next time I go down the
[1:29:12] iPad stays
[1:29:14] upstairs because I'm not going to pick
[1:29:16] up the Rock and put it in the good
[1:29:19] ground that's a very simple example but
[1:29:23] it's a it's a example that can have a
[1:29:25] ripple effect now that's only one night
[1:29:28] but if I continue to do that what's
[1:29:31] going to happen I'm going to start to
[1:29:32] snap I'm going to get tired I'm going to
[1:29:35] get weary I'm not going to have the
[1:29:37] right attitude and I may actually hurt
[1:29:39] one of you not physically I may respond
[1:29:42] in the wrong way I might hurt my own
[1:29:44] family and I can't sit there and say
[1:29:46] that's Satan that did that I've got to
[1:29:48] be able to say I move that rock into my
[1:29:51] life
[1:29:52] amen I've got to be able to say John you
[1:29:55] don't handle that well leave it
[1:29:59] alone let it
[1:30:01] go let it go let somebody else figure it
[1:30:04] out like I said it's not that it's wrong
[1:30:07] it's that it's hindering me it's choking
[1:30:09] my sleep choking my rest which chokes my
[1:30:12] attitude which chokes my Effectiveness
[1:30:15] which can choke my
[1:30:17] Ministry if I keep doing it you'd end up
[1:30:20] noticing something up
[1:30:22] here are you with me this
[1:30:25] evening so often we're looking around
[1:30:29] and we're blaming
[1:30:31] Satan and you know what we need to blame
[1:30:34] this guy right
[1:30:38] here me and
[1:30:42] Matt that's the nice thing about sitting
[1:30:44] at the back you can raise your hand and
[1:30:45] be humble and nobody knows
[1:30:47] it amen God bless you brother Matt I see
[1:30:51] you and everybody knows now
[1:30:54] but we're so busy looking around how
[1:30:57] come I'm this way and how come I'm that
[1:30:58] way listen if I'm tired and grumpy that
[1:31:01] day that ain't Satan's fault that's my
[1:31:02] fault and I've got to accept that and
[1:31:05] I've got to be able to say you can take
[1:31:07] that stone out of your life you can take
[1:31:09] those thorns out of your life amen we
[1:31:11] have every tool every Appliance every
[1:31:16] luxury every Comfort to take away the
[1:31:19] work in our life and yet we struggle to
[1:31:22] find time with God
[1:31:25] you know what it ain't
[1:31:28] Satan it's the hindrances I'm adding in
[1:31:31] I'm allowing in I'm placing in in some
[1:31:34] cases
[1:31:35] amen Satan's not throwing the rocks in
[1:31:37] half the time we're inviting them in
[1:31:39] we're picking them up and carrying them
[1:31:41] into our life but here's the thing God
[1:31:44] prepares Our
[1:31:46] Lives God has made it so we can produce
[1:31:49] fruit if we'll use the ground we're
[1:31:52] planted in now we're switching the
[1:31:54] metaphor okay now we're not the good
[1:31:55] ground now we're going to talk about the
[1:31:57] trees that are planted in good ground
[1:31:59] okay I believe God plants Us in
[1:32:02] condition so we can grow in Christ so
[1:32:05] that we can produce the fruit of the
[1:32:06] spirit so that we can produce the word
[1:32:08] inside of our lives and I believe that
[1:32:10] because the Psalms say it the very first
[1:32:13] Psalm says blessed is the man who
[1:32:14] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:32:16] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:32:18] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:32:20] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:32:23] of the Lord
[1:32:25] not on pulling threads on an
[1:32:27] iPad and in his law do he meditate day
[1:32:30] and night not on Instagram not on
[1:32:33] Facebook not on news
[1:32:37] media where's his Delight what's he
[1:32:40] dwell on the word of God this is a
[1:32:43] person whose life is defined and built
[1:32:46] around the word of God this isn't one
[1:32:49] verse a day
[1:32:51] Christian this isn't I read our daily
[1:32:54] strength
[1:32:56] Christian this isn't I go to church
[1:32:58] Wednesdays and Sundays Christian this is
[1:33:01] an everyday word feeding
[1:33:05] Christian you see the difference you see
[1:33:09] the difference 5 minutes a day ain't
[1:33:11] going to cut it
[1:33:13] church I envy some of you that talk to
[1:33:17] me about your devotion
[1:33:19] habits an hour and a half in the morning
[1:33:22] just of reading your Bible and a
[1:33:24] message
[1:33:26] wow now here's the thing I may not be
[1:33:29] able to get that I get about an hour in
[1:33:31] the mornings but I'll tell you this if I
[1:33:33] cut off my habits so that I go to bed at
[1:33:37] 10:00 I could wake up at 6:00 and still
[1:33:39] get seven and a half hours of sleep and
[1:33:41] I could get that hour and a half if I
[1:33:43] really wanted
[1:33:45] it but I
[1:33:47] don't why I'm not desperate enough
[1:33:51] yet I'm willing to do what I've got I'm
[1:33:54] willing to go with what I've got because
[1:33:56] I know I'm still going to spend 3 hours
[1:33:58] in the evening studying I can make up
[1:34:00] for
[1:34:02] it but we have an
[1:34:04] opportunity and we have choices to
[1:34:07] make whether or not we match up to verse
[1:34:12] two he says and he shall be like a tree
[1:34:15] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:34:18] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:34:20] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[1:34:22] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper it's
[1:34:25] like I said at the beginning we're not
[1:34:27] going to even get into the fruits of the
[1:34:28] spirit but we're talking about the
[1:34:30] conditions that produce the Fruit of the
[1:34:32] Spirit and the Holy Spirit now speaking
[1:34:34] through David here he says that somebody
[1:34:37] who has heard the word somebody that
[1:34:39] dwells on the word somebody that
[1:34:40] receives the word somebody that lives by
[1:34:42] the word they can be compared to a tree
[1:34:45] that's planted in a particular set of
[1:34:47] conditions and environment and that
[1:34:49] person does not magically land in a good
[1:34:52] place
[1:34:54] it says it doesn't say that this person
[1:34:57] landed by the rivers of
[1:34:59] water it doesn't say this person
[1:35:02] happened by rivers of water it says this
[1:35:06] person was planted by rivers of
[1:35:10] water okay there's nothing of Self in
[1:35:12] this this is The Sovereign work of God
[1:35:16] to place us where we can grow this is an
[1:35:18] intentional event this is an intentional
[1:35:21] event you don't plant things halfhazard
[1:35:24] who who's who's got the Green Thumb here
[1:35:25] brother Mark's got a green thumb anybody
[1:35:27] else plant in here a lot brother Mark is
[1:35:30] it all right brother Mark we're talking
[1:35:31] to you in the spring do you walk out
[1:35:36] with all of those beautiful flower seeds
[1:35:38] and just
[1:35:40] go go forth and
[1:35:43] prosper does he walk out and just you
[1:35:50] know tossing the seeds around do you do
[1:35:53] that
[1:35:55] no he doesn't he's thinking about it
[1:35:57] this is a new high-speed delivery
[1:36:00] system that's not what you do is it
[1:36:02] brother Mark because he's got places for
[1:36:05] those plants to grow he's got places
[1:36:07] that he has
[1:36:09] prepared that will support them they'll
[1:36:13] look good and they'll produce exactly
[1:36:15] what they
[1:36:17] are and he goes through the work this
[1:36:19] man puts manure in his minivan church
[1:36:22] that's the kind of preparation he goes
[1:36:24] through to make sure that they've got
[1:36:27] what they need to grow this is what it's
[1:36:29] talking about in the scripture they're
[1:36:31] planted in a place where they can grow
[1:36:34] amen God plants us where we can grow to
[1:36:37] the best
[1:36:39] effect that means we can't blame the
[1:36:42] ground okay we're switching our
[1:36:44] metaphors we can't blame the
[1:36:48] ground churches can have a lot of
[1:36:51] criticism but let me tell you if what
[1:36:53] comes out of those churches is Christ
[1:36:56] the ground was
[1:36:57] good and God planted them there not
[1:37:01] everybody was meant to have brother
[1:37:02] Gerald as a pastor not everybody's meant
[1:37:04] to have me as a pastor and all these
[1:37:06] other men that are around this world
[1:37:08] that are pastoring but if God places you
[1:37:11] then God will grow you there that simple
[1:37:14] that simple and so that means we can't
[1:37:17] blame the ground church if we're not
[1:37:19] growing the problem is not the ground
[1:37:21] because we're planted in a place where
[1:37:22] we can grow
[1:37:24] amen don't blame the ground don't blame
[1:37:27] God say what is it that I'm doing that's
[1:37:30] hindering my growth because he's planted
[1:37:32] me where I ought to be growing am I
[1:37:34] feeding where God has planted me that's
[1:37:37] really the question where are we planted
[1:37:40] rivers of water water is always life to
[1:37:43] plants that's all that's all it means to
[1:37:45] a plant is life brother Bram says this
[1:37:47] water represents life we know that Moses
[1:37:50] in the wilderness he smot The Rock and
[1:37:51] it gave forth Waters of life to it
[1:37:53] perishing people and then he would start
[1:37:55] to talk now in the in this next message
[1:37:58] planting yeah it's the same
[1:38:00] message and he starts to talk about the
[1:38:02] woman at the well and he's really
[1:38:04] bringing to life what Jesus was talking
[1:38:06] about when he says I'll give you water
[1:38:08] that you'll never thirst again Watch how
[1:38:10] he says this now he it's he's relaying
[1:38:12] the conversation of the woman at the
[1:38:14] well and as Jesus says but if you
[1:38:17] knew he says other words like this if
[1:38:20] you knew how close you were to the
[1:38:23] Fountain of Life I'd give you water that
[1:38:26] you wouldn't come here to draw he says
[1:38:28] I'll transplant you you Samaritan I'll
[1:38:31] bring you you sinner see the planting
[1:38:34] sometimes it's the seed but sometimes
[1:38:35] it's a transplanting youve got to be
[1:38:37] moved from where you are cuz you're not
[1:38:39] growing to where you will grow he says
[1:38:42] that's the unbeliever and doesn't
[1:38:44] believe in it if you'll only let me
[1:38:46] pluck you up this morning he said I'll
[1:38:48] plant you by the rivers of water I'll
[1:38:50] put you in a position by the baptism of
[1:38:53] the holy spirit that you'll believe
[1:38:56] every word that I say is the truth
[1:39:00] hallelujah that's the place where you
[1:39:02] are planted this evening church if you
[1:39:04] are a child of God filled with the Holy
[1:39:06] Spirit he has placed you in a place
[1:39:09] where you can grow and receive and
[1:39:11] believe every word of God he says you'll
[1:39:14] just let me pluck you up this morning
[1:39:16] you'd be a good Branch you don't belong
[1:39:18] in that wild Vineyard he says You Belong
[1:39:21] over here so let me pluck you up and
[1:39:23] plant You in My Name by the side of the
[1:39:25] riv Rivers he says every tributary of
[1:39:28] God's word for every word of God is true
[1:39:32] every Divine promises the truth I'll
[1:39:35] plant you by the rivers of one water one
[1:39:38] God and you'll bring forth fruit in your
[1:39:40] season your leaves shall not wither and
[1:39:43] whatsoever you do shall prosper you'll
[1:39:46] stand when there's no other place to
[1:39:50] stand he says you'll stand anyhow
[1:39:53] knowing that God made the
[1:39:56] promise when you know that God has
[1:39:58] planted you when you know that God has
[1:40:00] placed you then you know that God will
[1:40:02] help you stand he says let me pluck you
[1:40:05] up he said and plant you over here by
[1:40:08] this water that you don't have to run to
[1:40:10] these Creed places and denominational
[1:40:12] places to find you can't find it there
[1:40:14] anyhow let me pluck you up by this old
[1:40:17] dry well here that you have to take Tim
[1:40:20] buckets and Rattle and fuss and drink a
[1:40:22] little and come back and drink a little
[1:40:24] I'll give you eternal life Joy just like
[1:40:27] a well bubbling up into everlasting life
[1:40:30] he says let me let me do that for you
[1:40:33] Christ said to the woman The Sinner she
[1:40:36] couldn't produce that fruit she couldn't
[1:40:38] produce that life but he says if you'll
[1:40:40] let me take you from where you are this
[1:40:42] morning if you'll let me take you from
[1:40:44] where you are this evening I'll bring
[1:40:46] you to what you've been looking for all
[1:40:49] along not in this flesh but in your soul
[1:40:52] there's a hunger in your heart there's a
[1:40:54] desire in your soul for something he
[1:40:55] says if you'll let me I'll take you
[1:40:58] there he says and he says the same thing
[1:41:01] to the church this morning you know
[1:41:03] there is a God you believe there's a God
[1:41:06] can we say Amen to that this evening do
[1:41:08] we believe that there is a God he says
[1:41:11] but in your affiliation something cut
[1:41:14] you off you're in a desert there's no
[1:41:18] spiritual Joy you'd like to feel like
[1:41:21] they did on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:24] wouldn't you love to have the joy that
[1:41:25] they
[1:41:27] had he's talking about you're a part of
[1:41:29] a denomination and so you're cut off
[1:41:31] because that's not a part of the True
[1:41:34] Vine but we can get cut off in our
[1:41:37] affiliation we can get cut off just by
[1:41:40] Church
[1:41:41] attendance we can get cut off by our
[1:41:44] association if we're not planted in
[1:41:47] Christ we need the life of the
[1:41:49] association not the association we have
[1:41:51] a message church we believe we have the
[1:41:53] the message of the hour we believe we've
[1:41:54] got a Vindicated word this evening but
[1:41:57] that is not enough if we're not feeding
[1:41:58] on the word if there's not a life inside
[1:42:01] of us that's doing that amen if we've
[1:42:03] stopped feeding from The Well of life
[1:42:06] we're in a desert there's no spiritual
[1:42:09] Joy we're dried
[1:42:12] out broken
[1:42:15] cracked religious
[1:42:18] formal amen we've been hindered in our
[1:42:22] walk
[1:42:23] and it's not a God's
[1:42:25] doing but if you're planted by rivers of
[1:42:28] water what's the effect what does water
[1:42:31] du to a tree it grows it it matures it
[1:42:35] it produces leaves and then it produces
[1:42:38] life Fruit amen if there's Life by the
[1:42:43] water the tree will produce fruit that's
[1:42:46] what it's built to do it's built to
[1:42:47] produce fruit watch how David says it he
[1:42:49] says now he'll be like a tree planted by
[1:42:51] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[1:42:54] his fruit in his season I want to stop
[1:42:58] there notice it says his fruit his
[1:43:00] season you've got your fruit I've got my
[1:43:04] fruit we've all got the nature of
[1:43:07] Christ but there are things that we
[1:43:09] produce more evident than maybe the one
[1:43:11] next to us you've got areas of your life
[1:43:13] you've got a Ministry you've got a fruit
[1:43:15] of the spirit listen not all of us are
[1:43:17] known for our
[1:43:19] joyfulness not all of us are known for
[1:43:21] our patience
[1:43:23] not all of us are known for our Mercy
[1:43:25] those that produce those in great
[1:43:27] amounts those are the ones that we know
[1:43:29] them for but every one of us ought to be
[1:43:31] merciful every one of us ought to be
[1:43:33] loving every one of us ought to be
[1:43:34] patient and kind and these different
[1:43:36] things but you've got your special fruit
[1:43:38] and I've got mine if I can put it that
[1:43:42] way unique to you that's what he's
[1:43:45] saying here you've got your fruit and
[1:43:48] not just your fruit but you've got your
[1:43:51] season
[1:43:53] he's planted you he's placed you he's
[1:43:56] made you and therefore you've got to
[1:43:57] produce something
[1:44:00] amen but it's an expression of Christ
[1:44:02] Living Through
[1:44:03] you see in the when we talk about
[1:44:06] seasons of fruit we have different
[1:44:08] fruits and every fruit has its own
[1:44:10] season early in the year we might have
[1:44:13] our
[1:44:15] strawberries then you have your
[1:44:17] blueberries and your raspberries and
[1:44:19] these different things oranges and
[1:44:20] apples don't necessarily ripen at the
[1:44:22] same time time not only that you may not
[1:44:25] produce as much as the one next to you
[1:44:28] if you're of a different kind of fruit
[1:44:29] or a different kind of tree if we could
[1:44:31] put it that
[1:44:32] way you might only produce a little bit
[1:44:35] if you're a certain type of plant
[1:44:38] certain type of
[1:44:39] tree you might only sing one special a
[1:44:42] year but if that's the fruit of Christ
[1:44:45] in your
[1:44:47] life that's
[1:44:49] okay and then there'll be some that'll
[1:44:51] sing six specials a year
[1:44:54] and that's the fruit of their life in
[1:44:56] their season but here's the thing if
[1:44:59] you're singing one and you're meant to
[1:45:01] produce six that's a problem I'm not
[1:45:03] pointing at you sister
[1:45:06] Amber but think of it this way if you go
[1:45:09] up to a blueberry bush and it only has
[1:45:11] one
[1:45:12] blueberry what would you
[1:45:14] say is that a healthy
[1:45:17] Bush no cuz blueberries are supposed to
[1:45:21] have tons
[1:45:23] right you know you've reached a place of
[1:45:25] good blueberries when you picking
[1:45:28] handfuls of blueberries
[1:45:31] right see I can sit here and say I'm a
[1:45:33] Christian I've got a
[1:45:35] blueberry but how many blueberries am I
[1:45:37] supposed to
[1:45:40] have but blueberries you go pick over a
[1:45:43] blueberry patch and come back a week
[1:45:45] later and guess what you got church
[1:45:47] blueberries all over again it's a
[1:45:48] wonderful thing it's a wonderful thing
[1:45:50] sister Amber you used to live by that
[1:45:52] blueberry patch and those things you
[1:45:53] could go up with raspberries and you
[1:45:54] could go up a week later and you'd have
[1:45:56] raspberries where there were no
[1:45:57] raspberries you picked them all and you
[1:45:58] come back and you got raspberries try
[1:46:00] doing that to an apple tree you pick all
[1:46:02] the apples and you come back a week
[1:46:03] later what do you have nothing you done
[1:46:06] pick them that's it you're not getting
[1:46:08] anymore there's a fruit and there's a
[1:46:10] season
[1:46:12] amen there are some fruits or some
[1:46:15] plants that only Blossom and produce
[1:46:18] once a year once every few
[1:46:21] years and you've got to believe that
[1:46:25] it's worth it to own a plant like
[1:46:27] that you got to believe it's worth it to
[1:46:30] to have a plant for 3 years just to see
[1:46:33] it bloom
[1:46:36] once and if you don't believe it's worth
[1:46:38] it you won't do it will you and those
[1:46:40] are some of the rarest and most
[1:46:42] expensive ones because it takes a real
[1:46:44] effort to get them to grow and produce
[1:46:46] and you have to be perfect for three
[1:46:48] years otherwise they just die off and
[1:46:49] you lose the blooms
[1:46:53] this is an N plant beautiful isn't it so
[1:46:57] detailed
[1:46:58] intricate takes 3 years to bloom church
[1:47:02] and then it's it it's
[1:47:04] done brother Braham said this God can
[1:47:07] train a man take him a hundred years for
[1:47:10] 30 minutes work God knows how to
[1:47:15] train you may preach just a few sermons
[1:47:17] a
[1:47:18] year but if that's what God has called
[1:47:21] you to do if that's the fruit of your
[1:47:23] life in that
[1:47:24] season that's all that's required I've
[1:47:27] been in places where I only preach maybe
[1:47:29] three times a year and God took a lot of
[1:47:31] time to develop those
[1:47:34] sermons hours and hours and hours and
[1:47:39] hours way more than I can spend now CU I
[1:47:42] have months in between preaching and God
[1:47:44] could take it and he could hone it to
[1:47:46] Perfection and by God's grace it hit the
[1:47:49] mark every single time I'm not boasting
[1:47:51] I'm saying that's the testimony of the
[1:47:52] the
[1:47:54] Believers but I had to be okay with just
[1:47:57] producing that kind of fruit three times
[1:47:58] a year as long as it's the right kind of
[1:48:01] fruit
[1:48:03] amen we're not here to compare that's
[1:48:06] what I'm that's what I'm trying to get
[1:48:08] out of all this is we're talking about
[1:48:09] the fruit of the spirit and we're
[1:48:11] talking about the character and the
[1:48:12] nature of Christ but when it comes to
[1:48:13] the fruit of our life we're not here for
[1:48:16] comparison we're here to do what we are
[1:48:19] made to do that's it we have our our
[1:48:22] song leader and our musicians in effect
[1:48:25] they're doing a special every single
[1:48:26] service in a certain way they're up here
[1:48:29] doing a work for God every single
[1:48:31] service so that can't compare to Sister
[1:48:33] Priscilla that sings her specials or
[1:48:34] sister Amber or the other sisters that
[1:48:36] do it occasionally it's a different type
[1:48:39] of service it's a different type of
[1:48:40] fruit but the question is is that your
[1:48:42] season and your fruit and if it is God
[1:48:44] bless you but if we're holding
[1:48:48] back because we're not doing what we
[1:48:50] ought to do and we'll get to it in a
[1:48:51] moment then it's us that's the problem
[1:48:54] it's not a lack it's not a lack of God's
[1:48:57] inspiration it's a lack of us taking in
[1:48:59] what we're supposed to take
[1:49:01] in he says his Leaf also shall not
[1:49:06] wither what does it mean when you look
[1:49:08] at a plant and the Leaf's with
[1:49:11] withered my wife famously travels on
[1:49:14] vacation and leaves me to care for her
[1:49:17] plants if she comes back and the leaves
[1:49:20] are withered which may hair may not have
[1:49:23] happened multiple
[1:49:24] times what does that tell my
[1:49:28] wife I can say it till I'm blue in the
[1:49:31] face I watered your
[1:49:33] plants but if the leaves have withered
[1:49:36] guess what I
[1:49:39] didn't or I didn't enough that's the
[1:49:42] other thing see I'm scared of drowning
[1:49:46] them it's not funny makes a mess cuz see
[1:49:50] I overfill one one time and it made a
[1:49:52] big mess and so I don't want to overfill
[1:49:53] them but the thing is if she comes back
[1:49:56] and the leaves are withered what does it
[1:49:57] mean there wasn't enough
[1:50:00] water but here's the thing if you're
[1:50:02] planted by rivers of water and the leaf
[1:50:04] Withers what's the problem church it's
[1:50:08] not the
[1:50:09] river it's this
[1:50:11] guy if the leaves start to wither that's
[1:50:14] right Michael if the leaves start to
[1:50:16] wither it's cuz I'm not
[1:50:18] drinking the problem's not the water the
[1:50:20] water's there I'm planted by rivers of
[1:50:22] water they never run dry it's a Well of
[1:50:25] life so if my leaves start to
[1:50:28] wither the problems in the Drinker not
[1:50:32] in the
[1:50:33] drink for feeding on the word of God
[1:50:36] every day meditating on it dwelling on
[1:50:38] it feeding on
[1:50:39] it he says your leaves won't
[1:50:43] wither before you have fruit you have
[1:50:47] leaves and when the fruit goes away the
[1:50:49] leaves still stick around for a while
[1:50:50] don't they see we have Seasons
[1:50:54] now but this is a chur this is a this is
[1:50:57] a tree that never goes through a loss of
[1:50:59] leaf it's always there we call it an
[1:51:01] evergreen except it has leaves instead
[1:51:03] of needles he says your Leaf NE never
[1:51:06] Withers if you're a person that's
[1:51:08] feeding yourself the way you're supposed
[1:51:10] to be fed if you're feeding where God
[1:51:12] has planted you your Leaf never never W
[1:51:15] never
[1:51:19] Withers might not be your time to
[1:51:21] produce fruit
[1:51:24] but let me tell you if you've got leaves
[1:51:26] on the tree it's a place of Refuge it's
[1:51:29] a place of
[1:51:31] shelter it's a place where people can
[1:51:33] cool off it still has a
[1:51:37] benefit and then he says and
[1:51:40] whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:51:43] prosper why because you're feeding on
[1:51:46] the Eternal Word of
[1:51:48] God not prospering by the sweat of your
[1:51:50] brow now
[1:51:52] see Adam was prospering in his
[1:51:54] fruitfulness by the word until he put
[1:51:56] the word aside and that's when he
[1:51:59] started to
[1:52:00] sweat but when you're a tree you don't
[1:52:03] have to sweat you just have to keep
[1:52:06] feeding that's it it's easy it's easy
[1:52:10] Church how come you're not greater
[1:52:12] Christians how come we're not greater
[1:52:13] Christians it's so easy but it is easy
[1:52:16] and by that I mean it's simple it's not
[1:52:18] hard to understand
[1:52:23] this is God speaking to Joshua he says'
[1:52:25] only be thou very strong and very
[1:52:27] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[1:52:28] do according to all the law which Moses
[1:52:31] my servant commanded thee he said Joshua
[1:52:33] stay with the word turn not from it to
[1:52:35] the right hand or to the left that thou
[1:52:37] mayest Prosper withs soever thou
[1:52:40] goest David said this this man that's
[1:52:43] planted by rivers of water he'll prosper
[1:52:46] in whatever you do God says to Joshua
[1:52:48] Joshua you stay with the word that my
[1:52:50] Prophet gave you you'll prosper and
[1:52:52] everything you do why cuz you're not
[1:52:54] going your way you're going my way
[1:52:56] you're not going by your will you're
[1:52:57] going by my will you're not going by
[1:52:59] your leadership you're going by my
[1:53:00] leadership you're staying with my
[1:53:02] promise and I'll come behind and I'll
[1:53:04] back that up last set of quotes he says
[1:53:07] and all you do with the little tree you
[1:53:11] just plant it and then you have to give
[1:53:13] it water and it just drinks and it has
[1:53:15] to drink more than it's a lotted portion
[1:53:18] I want you to catch that if that tree
[1:53:20] wants to grow it has to take
[1:53:23] more than it needs it has to eat based
[1:53:26] on what it wants to be not based on what
[1:53:29] it
[1:53:30] is you know they have this thing that I
[1:53:33] don't know if it's true anymore they say
[1:53:35] in your career dress for the position
[1:53:37] you want to have not the position you
[1:53:41] have what's he saying
[1:53:43] here
[1:53:45] drink
[1:53:46] feed to be what you want to be not based
[1:53:50] on where you're at right now
[1:53:54] he says and the more it drinks it begins
[1:53:56] to push out next service I promise you
[1:53:59] as far as I know Lord willing we're
[1:54:01] going to preach on the fruit of the
[1:54:02] spirit you say brother John how do I
[1:54:04] produce the fruit of the spirit the more
[1:54:07] it drinks it begins to push out and it
[1:54:10] pushes out leaves it pushes out branches
[1:54:13] we've all seen little trees grow right
[1:54:16] first thing comes up just a little sprig
[1:54:18] and then what does it do it has a little
[1:54:20] leaf and that turns into a branch and
[1:54:22] then off that comes more leaves and more
[1:54:24] branches and then out of those come more
[1:54:25] leaves and then eventually it says it
[1:54:28] pushes out oranges pushes out blossoms
[1:54:31] and pushes out oranges then it keeps
[1:54:33] drinking pushing out more oranges and
[1:54:35] leaves and Blossoms just drinks drinks
[1:54:38] drinks drinks I said at the end of this
[1:54:41] service we know how to produce the fruit
[1:54:42] of the spirit here's your answer drink
[1:54:44] drink drink
[1:54:48] drink before we came to church my head
[1:54:50] was really starting to ache
[1:54:53] I told my wife I said I'm dehydrated you
[1:54:55] know what I did I went and I drank a lot
[1:54:58] of
[1:54:59] water and I drank and I drank and I
[1:55:02] drank and I drank and what did it do it
[1:55:05] took away my
[1:55:09] dehydration you want to produce drink
[1:55:12] drink drink drink he says and when a
[1:55:15] Believer is placed in Christ Jesus
[1:55:17] you're planted in there in the
[1:55:19] inexhaustible Fountain of Life and the
[1:55:21] more you drink drink the more you push
[1:55:25] out what goes in must come out it's got
[1:55:28] to go
[1:55:29] somewhere and so he's saying the more
[1:55:31] you
[1:55:33] drink the more benefit you'll
[1:55:35] get that's right he says if you can't
[1:55:38] believe he says well I believe that
[1:55:40] Jesus saves me that's good then how
[1:55:42] about the Holy Ghost believe he give you
[1:55:44] the Holy Ghost he promised it to you
[1:55:46] about Divine Healing believe it he
[1:55:48] promised it to you he's saying if you're
[1:55:49] at a certain level and you want to go to
[1:55:51] the next level start drinking like
[1:55:53] you're at the next level you got to
[1:55:56] drink to grow you got to feed on the
[1:55:58] word to grow you've got to feed your
[1:56:00] faith because faith comes by hearing and
[1:56:02] hearing comes by the word it's in the
[1:56:05] word that you're going to find what you
[1:56:07] need and you'll find this beautiful
[1:56:09] quote as we finish here tonight he says
[1:56:11] every Redemptive blessing belongs to you
[1:56:15] just drink and drink and push out
[1:56:23] how many here want a greater experience
[1:56:25] with
[1:56:27] God half of
[1:56:31] us by a show of hands how many here want
[1:56:34] a greater experience with God there we
[1:56:37] go all of
[1:56:49] us have you ever had a week
[1:56:52] where you just
[1:56:54] seemed to hit the marks every
[1:56:58] day you went to bed at the right time
[1:57:01] you got up at the right time you had
[1:57:04] your
[1:57:04] devotions you made it to every church
[1:57:07] service you got some
[1:57:09] fellowship anybody ever have a week like
[1:57:12] that I've had them I don't always have
[1:57:15] them but I've had
[1:57:17] them why because you're feeding on that
[1:57:21] which produced produces what you
[1:57:24] need and the thing is you skip a day
[1:57:27] here you skip a day there you sleep in
[1:57:29] here you stay up late there and what
[1:57:31] happens is you start to lose some of
[1:57:34] that momentum to produce that fruit see
[1:57:37] what happened is you pushed out the
[1:57:40] Blossom and the blossom is what smells
[1:57:42] the best you ever in a around the Orange
[1:57:45] Groves in that and the blossoms are
[1:57:46] there you can smell it but we're not
[1:57:49] here for blossoms we're here for fruit
[1:57:53] and what happens is we get to a certain
[1:57:55] place and we say that's pretty
[1:57:57] good and it's blossom season but we're
[1:58:00] trying to get the fruit season and we
[1:58:03] got to keep drinking and we got to keep
[1:58:05] drinking and we got to keep drinking
[1:58:07] That's
[1:58:08] Why th this is the way I find it I
[1:58:10] believe most people do when we come in
[1:58:12] and we have special meetings and we go
[1:58:14] Friday night Saturday night Sunday
[1:58:16] Morning by Sunday afternoon we might be
[1:58:18] beat out but don't we feel like we could
[1:58:21] destroy anybody body any weapon any army
[1:58:25] any demon any influence we feel like
[1:58:27] we're able to take the
[1:58:31] country every promise in the book is
[1:58:34] mine why because our Focus has been
[1:58:37] drinking drinking
[1:58:40] drinking and the thing is in those
[1:58:43] moments that's when we ought to strike
[1:58:45] cuz we're strong but the problem is we
[1:58:48] walk out and we don't drink and we don't
[1:58:50] drink and we don't drink and 3 weeks
[1:58:52] later we're right back to where we
[1:58:55] were we got to keep drinking got to keep
[1:58:58] feeding got to keep pressing got to keep
[1:59:01] pushing not to stay
[1:59:05] satisfied to
[1:59:07] grow
[1:59:09] amen he says every Redemptive blessing
[1:59:12] belongs to you just drink and drink and
[1:59:16] push out that's all everything you have
[1:59:20] need of is right in you oh wow
[1:59:23] we're talking about faith listen to this
[1:59:24] he says when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:59:26] everything you've got need of between
[1:59:28] here and glory is right in you then
[1:59:31] hallelujah when you receed the Holy
[1:59:33] Ghost you are bound for eternity
[1:59:36] everything you have need of is right
[1:59:38] there with you it's in you he says it
[1:59:41] ain't Faith you need
[1:59:44] what we're asking God give me more faith
[1:59:46] give me more faith give me more faith he
[1:59:48] says you got faith if you've got the
[1:59:50] holy spirit for he is your your faith
[1:59:52] but what do you have to do drink drink
[1:59:56] drink drink maybe that should have been
[1:59:59] the title tonight drink drink drink
[2:00:01] drink it's
[2:00:03] simple it's not easy but it's
[2:00:07] simple amen God bless you let's
[2:00:11] stand what's the problem it's not the
[2:00:15] word it's not where we're
[2:00:17] planted it's what we're drinking it's
[2:00:20] whether we're drinking and then how much
[2:00:22] we're
[2:00:22] drinking
[2:00:25] amen that's what he's trying to get to
[2:00:27] the people he's saying where I think
[2:00:28] Pentecost failed what is you stopped at
[2:00:31] the part that you were satisfied with
[2:00:34] rather than going all the way into the
[2:00:35] promises of God cuz they did they
[2:00:38] stopped at the gifts and they didn't go
[2:00:40] all the way into the word they were
[2:00:42] happy to stay with the gifts we talked
[2:00:43] about it last service when El elazar
[2:00:46] came and and he brought uh you know he
[2:00:48] was looking for a bride for Isaac and
[2:00:50] when he comes and he finds Rebecca he
[2:00:52] gives her gifts and if she accepted
[2:00:54] those gifts they were
[2:00:56] hers she didn't have to go but she
[2:01:00] wanted to be with Isaac not just have
[2:01:02] the gifts that's where Pentecost failed
[2:01:05] they stopped at the blossoms and they
[2:01:06] didn't go on to the true fruit which is
[2:01:08] Christ
[2:01:09] himself and it's a lovely place when it
[2:01:11] all smells great and it looks great but
[2:01:14] if you never come to fruit you're dead
[2:01:17] you never had all you never had the
[2:01:18] fullness of life in you that's what he's
[2:01:21] saying to us as believers
[2:01:22] you can have the truth you can come to a
[2:01:25] message church you can sit under the
[2:01:27] hearing of the word you can believe
[2:01:29] every word of it but you've got to feed
[2:01:31] on what he's placed in front of you amen
[2:01:36] listen I'll say this Satan is a master
[2:01:40] at putting opportunity in front of us to
[2:01:42] take us away from the word we have every
[2:01:45] possible distraction to us listen if
[2:01:47] you've got a phone he doesn't need to
[2:01:49] give you anything else in your life that
[2:01:51] alone will distract you if you let it
[2:01:53] but then add to that we have our our
[2:01:55] businesses we have our jobs we have our
[2:01:57] family needs we have church needs and
[2:01:58] all these things and listen you can get
[2:02:00] so caught up in church that you forget
[2:02:02] the
[2:02:03] word absolutely absolutely that's why I
[2:02:06] need to have devotions not just study
[2:02:09] because God's got to have a place where
[2:02:11] he can deal with me personally directly
[2:02:13] for my life not that he doesn't in
[2:02:15] studying absolutely he does but I've got
[2:02:17] to have a place where I can go talk to
[2:02:18] him about my needs my family's needs and
[2:02:21] these different things not just church
[2:02:22] needs I can get so caught up in being a
[2:02:24] minister that I forget to be a
[2:02:27] Christian for sure get caught up in the
[2:02:31] duty and forget the
[2:02:33] life and if I do that you know what
[2:02:35] happens I get dry cracked brittle worn
[2:02:40] out and then I
[2:02:42] snap that's what we do we've got to
[2:02:45] drink from water the pure
[2:02:48] word every single day trees don't just
[2:02:52] drink a little bit they drink constantly
[2:02:56] if it's there they're constantly taking
[2:02:57] it and they're pulling it up and pushing
[2:02:59] it out they drink like they're not going
[2:03:01] to have a drink ever
[2:03:02] again that's what we're supposed to
[2:03:05] be
[2:03:07] amen God bless you this evening let's
[2:03:09] bow our heads Heavenly
[2:03:12] Father Lord a simple instruction here
[2:03:15] tonight

[2:03:20] says those that are thirsty come and
[2:03:26] drink Lord the problem's not the
[2:03:29] fountain it's not the source Lord so
[2:03:32] often the hindrance is whether we'll
[2:03:35] come up and take that
[2:03:37] drink Lord I'm not preaching to a
[2:03:39] congregation I'm preaching to myself

[2:03:52] we would have more of you we've got to

[2:03:59] the time to have a Pure Source that can
[2:04:01] produce the Life of Christ inside of us
[2:04:04] Heavenly Father Lord I pray you help us
[2:04:06] to set aside every little weight every
[2:04:09] little sin every little anxiety every
[2:04:11] little habit Lord that those stones that
[2:04:14] we would blame so often on others Lord
[2:04:16] let us look at our life and see have I
[2:04:19] placed that stone have I planted that
[2:04:21] set of of thorns in my life Lord have I
[2:04:24] placed a hindrance on your
[2:04:26] word Lord and if we have Lord I pray you
[2:04:29] forgive me forgive us Lord help us to
[2:04:33] root it out Lord and go feed on the
[2:04:35] things we ought to feed on Lord take
[2:04:38] away our
[2:04:39] excuses Lord help us to be humble before
