man God blesses a man just to begin here tonight there are other things that I have on my Arden in my mind and praying the grace of God to help us in it but to begin turn with me to Genesis chapter 20 the book of Genesis chapter 20 a man and I certainly law certainly want to welcome our brothers sister Baigent a man and also our sister athough see a man and the Lord willing I have I've asked her that if she would come forth and give us a testimony and we would provide total we provide the chair so she can sit down a man and she can take as long as she wants and if you're sitting down you can take as long as you want amen so we certainly welcome our brother sister Megha this is the second time to back to Newfoundlands the second time o.9 they're newfies yeah so they'll come back for the last time call for you to stay as I've already said just recently about about their daughters and and others here from the states and our brother from India and the others from the Congo I said you're here for the rapture amen I said that's why the Lord led you here praise the name of the Lord God has got that place predestinated for you and for me where we're going to be at the time of the right hey man so let's believe for the rapture let's believe with the resurrection a male so we pray the grace of God be with us as we go further into the service and and God bless our sister Carl a man we have to look at the name but as he amen it is certainly not a new free name but I believe we're going to be able to say her name right when we get into glory hey man maybe the Lord is going to leave that name behind amen so we'll have another name by the grace of God so Lord blesses and in Genesis chapter 20 and if our brother bang at one sing we certainly would we wouldn't know it we wouldn't know it but he wouldn't hesitate you know whatever's on your heart do it they do it for the glory of God amen and Genesis 20 and beginning to read at verse 1 and Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelt between Kadesh brother John kaduche is here they met and it says he dwelled between Kadesh and Shur and sir Joran in Guerrero and Abraham said of Sarah his wife she is my sister and Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah because Abram was afraid that maybe that if he knew that it was his wife that the king would kill him so as to get Sara but he said no he said she's my sister and it says a biblical Guerrera sent and took Sara but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him be old thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou has taken it says for she is a man's wait but if Evelyn had not come near her and he said Lord will thou slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this and God said unto Him in a dream yay I know that that it's did did this in the integrity of thy heart for I also where they'll be from sinning against me Amen praise the Lord I thank God for them for the explosion is like a man thank God for the influence in your life and in mine a man but God cares for about us God cared about the King God didn't wanted to do this because he knew that in his heart he didn't we you wouldn't want to do it a man so brother says that God knows your heart God knows what your motives and your objectives are a man they think will bring out when we get back into the message that that I that I have been ministering on hey man you've got to have a right motive and a right objective even if you're asking for healing he said what is your motive what is your objective and he said you're a motive and objection was not right he says you don't deserve a Lee a man the problem of gods for that and yeah I think God is not going to heal it and again I know and there are those that do get good heal and the motive is not right their objective is not right because that's what the prophet of God said you can be healed and go to hell Amen because your motive and objection is not right nature does make sure that our spirit is right or attitude is right removes the writer objectives are right toward God a man and for the glaze off of the glory of God amen no matter what it is lord you appoint the thing that conserves me and for me and let it be for your glory not just for my benefit in the public on sir that's the problem with people today only they want God to do this one God to do that but it's only for their benefit he said amen it not for the glory of God amen so god help us that whatever we do it'll be for his glory whatever we ask God it'll be for the glory of God a man and gods verse 6 again and God said unto Him in a dream yeah I know that that it's do this in the integrity of thy heart for I also with LD from sitting against me thank God for that grace in our lives amen and he said therefore suffer die the not to touch her God stepped on the scene praise the Lord and he said verse 7 now therefore restore the man is way showing what god sent on the scene here because of the elected predestinated seat a man Abraham and because of the position that he held before God so God has step on the scene for you and for me because we are the predestinated seat of God a man and that we are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ thank God for that grace amen and he said now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet a man wonderful and as as he shall pray for thee and thou should live and if thou restorer not know that thou shalt utterly die thou and all that are thine god bless his word you may be seated amen we wanted our sister to come and give her testimony of her experience with the Prophet a man I was I was blessed when she testified at our brother Joseph / Artur last night a man and she was talking about her experience with the prophet of God when her and her husband first met the Prophet when they come into the presence of the Prophet and I said this is amazing I said thank you Lord and then it was the grace of God in her life from the grace of God in her husband's life a man then I just crossed the path but brother that the Prophet ministered to her a man and brother she can go back and and remember it she could go back and share with others a man of indication that Abraham was a prophet sold with him Branham was a prophet a man wanted to highlight some of those Saints concerning the prophet in the Bible from Genesis right on through to Revelation because the first time that God mentions the Prophet is here in Genesis 20 and the last time that God mentions the Prophet is in Revelation 20 to a man and there are those that today that feel that the Prophet that is mentioned in revelation 22 was Malachi 4 it was a prophet a man to whom that God used for the opening of the seven seals and the finishing of the mystery of God in the last days and we're sure we were sure those scriptures with you later on in revelation 22 a man because John was going to worship Him amen but he any-any forbid John the noise and don't you do that and how nice time George well I enjoyed one of your brethren the prophets that's all and but again they even in this day in this hour that we we are we've we've dealt with it and we'll continue to deal with it there are those even in this age and then that are that are worshiping brother Branham or that summer worshiping his son but again whether that's that's not right that a that's absolutely a fall spirit so we pray the grace of God to give us the right spirit the way to revelation concerning who with and who and what are properties we see it right here in Genesis we see it right here in Revelation but again whether it's not God it is God in the Prophet the Prophet is my god no way because this prophet right here he refused worship and not only they have the Prophet in the hell praise the Lord hallelujah I believe this this helps us believe that the Prophet in revelation 22 was the Malachi 4 because we have it on tape where they promised stood behind the pulpit and any any found a note any in his pocket say brother I put a note in his pocket and said that Whitten Branham was his Lord that's where he's saying I've been when brother Bentham saw the note oh my he got up and he ran he rebuked that spirit and he said he said that's what he said I that's not me in and he said I said I am NOT the Lord he said don't do don't you ever say those things don't you believe those things and he said because they said that'll make me Antichrist he said you you believe that and you say that make me out of Christ and if you continue with that he said all he said in six months he said I'll get out of the ministry he said I'll step down he said because he said I don't want to be he didn't want to be Antichrist so I pray the grace of God that we're going to recognize him as a prophet a man recognizes is his ministry recognized his message but brother we're not going to worship Him we're going to worship the one that the message reveals where were the one that we're going to were sure the one that he pointed us to the order went to worship the one that he was exalting a man as the Lord Jesus Christ as our Lord our Savior our bridegroom a man he certainly didn't want us to worship Him a man so by the grace of God I got help us to have the right revelation of a prophet even though God or God God bless and God exalted Abraham but you had a brother they're not ordained to worship Abraham not by any means no worship the God that a brain was representing worship the God that Abraham was preaching about worship the God that Abraham was exalting a man Abraham was giving the glory to God hey man look with people to come and worsen him a man he will point in to the Lord a man though the Lord stepped on the scene and defended Moses are defended whether Abraham because of who he was because of the office that he was in as a prophet brothers sicilus understand that the Prophet is beyond beyond a pastor or a teacher or an evangelist or an apostle the Prophet goes beyond that and not only that even there in Ephesians 2 where it speaks speaks ability to God has said in the church you know this fivefold ministry and said a prophet but the power God said now he said that's a New Testament prophet he said there's not an Old Testament prophet that's not the prophet that the Bible refers to as the spokesman for God a man no it's just just someone preaching the word just someone teaching the word and so on he said that's a New Testament prophet but the brother the prophet that we recognize in this day an hour is is it's recognizing the Old Testament as an Old Testament prophet recognized as John was a prophet and others were prophets a man day that's what we got a recognize we're not going to worship them we're going to worship the God that they're representing we're gonna worship them because what is a prophet he is a spokesman and he is a spokesman for God a man and God deals with prophets in a more intimate way that he deals with the other part with the rest of the PI PO ministry oh yeah God is going to do with a prophet in a more personal way than he does with the vital ministry the anointing is there for the vital ministry but for the Prophet it's in a greater way a man so god help us to recognize and honor respect the Prophet that God sent in this hour and in this age brother he had a ministry above and beyond any fivefold ministry oh yes then not only that but what he left is in the hands of the fifl ministry because he said when they asked him that question in the old me the seven seals and they said both around as though does the bride ever ministry and he says yes he said it's the fivefold ministry a man and he named them and he says every spinny spinny it's been here ever since he said the day of Pentecost a man from the day of Pentecost right on through to the last day God was depending on the fight for ministry to take the message he came through Peter amen and the faithful ministry went forth with it he made right on down through seven Church ages and now a day in this age for the ministry of the Prophet to the to the bride in the bride age he made there's a fight for ministry to the bride to exalt the minced of the message as her father said we're going from the Prophet ISA to the prophecy and we're going so from the messenger to the message and there is a ministry there there is a powerful ministry to exalt the prophecy amai there's a fifl ministry there to exalt the message a man what is it to get it to give us what it's ordained to do and it's ordained to give us rapturing faith the Provost said to fifl minister the the third pole of his ministry and the revealing of the word the only the seven seals the the mystery of God he said his rapturing faith a man we're without excuse we'll get more into it later on turn with me to well you can turn with me if you want to let's go to revelation 22 and then I want to turn it to our sister boat Ozzy to give us a testimony of her meeting with the Prophet to us we've been blessed hearing the Prophet to us we've been blessed reading about the Prophet we've been blessed just watching the Prophet may be our honor on a on a film and it's on and to hear those those things and see those things by the grace of God but brother what a blessing it was for our sister Petoskey here to have been in the presence of the Prophet a man to have talked with the Prophet the Prophet talked with her to have the Prophet discern the thoughts and intents of her heart a man and reveal of revealed things to her not only that a man therefore the problem to take take her hand in his a man praise the name of the Lord I was blessed when she when she was explaining that there last night and she was saying he took my hand and it was in his hand and she looked at his hand and she saw she saw the things but that the prophet of God was looking at but he knew what it meant he knew what he knew what it was revealed to him that she had this sickness or she had that sickness and so on praise the Lord but he said it was not to death the doctor he wanted to do surgery for overseas no way she went to the Prophet he did the surgery a man and just saying that she held his anniela Iran and she could see the spirit moving in the Prophet a man and the Prophet giving her thus saith the Lord there private a man which he moved way the problem went over where she was and talk to her again it may mazing thank God for her testimony a man it's a blessing to have somebody here that was with the Prophet bless you to have somebody here that talked with the Prophet anybody that that that experienced the ministry of the Prophet in the first and second pole a man thank God she's under the third pole a man but it's wonderful to be under the first and second but it's even greater to be under the third a man the others the others were just getting our attention they got more than her attention it healed her amen but then that brought her to the recognition of a prophet that God has sent a prophet and he was he was sent to her hey man but now no she's coming back she's she wants to get back to where the Prophet is as like a when our sister coffee passed away and we were in the in the wake there at that the funeral and our brother guy was there and he said all I said praise the Lord he said amazing brother journal he said this is wonderful just think he's the sister coffee she said is with the Prophet now she said he said he's feldsher or she's fella sitting with him in it in another dimension that's right I believe that because I believe that all those that were came under Luther's dirt fellowshiping with Luther all those that came under the Wesley they felt sorry Wesley all those they came under the Pentecostals and so under fellowshiping with the Pentecostals that started a hundred years ago amen that's right we're all going to get together with those when you hit when you we leave here and go into that dimension we believe in our sister I believe sister sadie is there and also our sister Dunford amen third and the budget but put this way do not do not all they don't have gray hair hey man I well sister Sadie did she didn't worry about it even though she was almost 99 years old when the Lord took her she said that's why yes but don't worry about it she said if I get to be a hundred she said I'll start with one again and I'll be one year old and so on so that's what that's what she believed but now she's just a young woman hey man she's their fellowshiping with with those Saints a man just same old brothers sister that I believe I believe oh yes she saw the word she believed it amen she came out of that out of that church that she was in and she you know and it's amazing I says amazing that she the first message she heard was marriage and divorce yeah now and I thought well surely you wouldn't play wouldn't let anybody hear that message for the first there might be the last one you hear you know but not the first but that was the only message first message rather she heard and it was sister Dunford the spirit of with her because she while she wanted to a message by twindom Bradham she heard it with him random because she when she was on any on the mainland there that they're doing well I was a long time ago but our sister back here might remember when that when that American politician was healed who was that Upshaw congressman Upshaw when he was healed well sister city was attending a certain Pentecostal Church in Ontario at the time and then the pastor got up and he was preaching you know signs and wonders and and then the power of God and knowing of God we need and he said always said I just heard he said he said that he said a congressman in the United State was healed and he said he went he went to one of william branham services to them when the Brenham was just an evangelist that's a that's all he was and he said I just just heard that he said he said he was in need our brother branham service and he said brother Bellamy suit was on his way out when he turned around and spoke to him and he said I told him that they that he does say the Lord he was healed a man and then he said and he was in a wheelchair and he said now and he is healed a man and so he guess what sister Sadie heard about wooden ramp above the healing that had happened in one of his meetings and then when she moved back to Newfoundland and she knew knew about sister Hubbard and myself and sister Betty and we knew knew that we just were nondenominational and she wanted to know what we believed and so on and her spirit was right her attitude was right it was real nice amen and so we told her and she wanted to hear a sermon by William Branham and since the dumper gave her a marriage and divorce well I tell you that brother that'll prove your faith a man that approve your election and she listened she heard the tape and she calls her stood up and on the phone and she told my dear she said sister Dunford that was wonderful she said that is absolutely the truth and she said I believe it a man and I caught a concert her to leave the leave the church she was in at the time and then to get more and more into the message of the hour and when of course we know that she eventually ended up in here and fellowship e with us in the in a seniors home and so on and eventually the Lord took her home a million so she she didn't matter to her window louvers little take her she was ready to go a man and just think she's with sister Dunford now and I believe she's with sister coffee a man and their fellows have been with the Saints of this age the bride aged by the grace of God waiting for the resurrection and rapture Darwin yawn you know probably God said they are waiting on us not also waiting on them he said they are waiting on us he said now he said they're going to appear to us but we got to come to that faith that will bring them from that dimension to this one and then he said we're going to go right into that dimension with them and he said we're going to be going to a glorified body instantly a man and then he said we're going to look up and in that pillar fire it's gonna be embodied in that body called Jesus and he said we're going to go up and meet him rise to meet him in the clouds praise the Lord brother sister we've already rose up to meet him in the cloud that's right because the Prophet God said there he is looking looking down at us yeah whoo Jesus he said that was the cloud of angels that came down and Chryslers in the cloud hey man brother sister we're caught up spiritually into the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ we're going to be caught up physically amen by the grace of God God help us amen god help us to believe now that doctrine is this theology and a theology have assimilate the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ amen it's the revelation of Christ with us by grace revered turned to revelation 22 and beginning to read at verse 8 and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard them heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things a man is there producing worshiping us a spirit of worship in us it produced a spirit of worship in John brother when when Jesus appeared to John John fell down is one dead before him Amen I pray God with them that the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ will have that effect on you and me that we're going to die died spiritually as it were amen so he'll raises up by the grace of God and he said I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren the prophets he was a prophet showing John all these things amen and he said I am of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book he said worship God amen worship God and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is that an amen for the revelation she'll not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is that an what time as Christ told John in Revelation 10 he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as the earth declared to his servants the prophets amen in that that time that time is that an this was this was the end your brother they weren't back there but you and I are back here that problem that profit was there during that time of the opening of the word amen their problem was there for the revelation of the mystery of God do God be the glory amen our prophet in the beginning I was I don't have time to get into that a prophet in Genesis and a prophet in Revelation God used a prophet in the beginning with his word and God uses a prophet at the end with his word now into the Gentiles but to the Jews as well they're looking for a prophet oh yeah because remember our prophet was God went beyond the curtain of time and also in Israel within the last few years there's two or three that I've been young men that had been caught beyond the curtain of time in Israel yeah and it's even on the internet now somewhere where rabbis got got him to come one of them brought those young men together and and got him to explain everything that he saw what he experienced and so on beyond the curtain of time brother we'd better look up I don't know how much time we got left but the rapture is upon us please let let God by the word catch us up and catches into another dimension let's become more conscious of that to that dimension than this one by the if the more were more were in the world the more were listening to the word more we're hearing the word the more were we're reading the word the more conscious we're going to get of that dimension yeah more we focus on it as I said let me say it again are we got we're going to be like Jesus what do you mean when he was here in the Alpha ministry we're gonna be like Jesus in the Omega ministry was what was he like he wanted to get out of here he did how much longer shall I be with you do you have that feeling I do do you have that feeling didn't Oh I can't put up with much more while what's going on in this whole world nor I just leave it all with you I plead the token life of the blood of Jesus for this one for that one but Lord we're moving on to the resurrection we're moving on to the rapture brothers no no they're not all going in to rapture they're not all wanting the resurrection stone you the elect the very elect only the bright by the grace of God and he said how much longer shall I be with you with that with that world of unbelief and then he got to the place where he knew his ministry was changing and he said I am no more in the world he was on his way out his faith was taking control and leading him amen and he and he went to get cemani he went to Calvary laid his life down picked it up again by the grace of God and the brighter Christ is going to lay her life down to the to the world the things of the world and we're picking it up and going going into rapture we're dead to the world and to the things of the world but we're alive to our bridegroom grace to us amen brother the Prophet told John right at the end of all things see or not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at an and notice the message that went forth praise the Lord and he said in verse 17 it revealed Christ as the Alpha the Omega they man Christ was revealed in this hour as the bridegroom and on down it says oh this is tremendous we broke I preached on this a long time ago to show you that this is the hour we're living and he said and the spirit and the bride say come Wow the bride's has come yeah the bright and let him that err say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely amen so the bride's redeemed a man but the message is going for by the grace of God so I prayed the grace of God be with us brother were called for a witness to the world is there anybody any well we're looking for the last member of the bride well it's going to come to a place for the last member of being and we'll just be a witness like here saying come per take of the word brother again we know the the revelation of wise virgins and foolish virgins as the prophet said I believe I mentioned it at the camp that the Provost said that the there's a foolish virgins he said they're saved but he said they got to go through the tribulation lay down their lives for the gospel amen so great grace to help us lay down our lives now spiritually so there we're going to be caught up in the rapture it's good it's it's right on our footsteps it's right right on our toes as it were by the grace of God the brother but the prophet of God knew it was late in his hour and in his day in his age how late is it for you and me over 50 years later well I guess says well over fifty years since our our sister er met with the Prophet was it in his own yeah it is amazing so we're going to let our sister come forward and give us a testimony about the experience that she had with the Prophet in his home this tremendous praise the Lord I I drove by us all I wasn't in his home and I would doubt very much if it was the same maybe same home but that a that his son Joseph lives in now so we drove by and I got pictures of it and so on and and I would say that when she was there brother banks Woods was next door and he's not there now his house is there but I don't think banks woods is there so and how of course when the May family was on the other side and her house is still there I don't know if any may family is there but I was still there yeah so thank God but brother the important thing is there is to believe what God revealed through the Prophet and what God is doing now through that ministry good thank God Lord bless you I went to this thing only believe again and asked our sister to come sister Karl Petoskey to come and oh and this chair for her oh it's there for her okay they got that chair for you right there so so as Santa's saying only believe what our sister comes and pray pray god bless her and I pray god bless you through her testimony it's just an sister Maureen's you play really oh oh fainter possible Oh baby only only believe all things are possible only be li only father we ask the grace of your presence with us and the grace of your presence your anointing with our sister Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to bless her testimony Lord father we waited a long time to receive such a testimony of someone lower that personally knew your prophet personally Lord had the Prophet minister to her oh Jesus thank you lord proving that you're the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah so we pray you bless her tonight Lord as she will reflect many things to his Lord concerning the Prophet concerning the ministry concerning the word discerning

praise in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ a man and a man praise the Lord God bless you [Music] yeah he felt led to go down to Georgia but nevertheless he said he told him he had met this brother and he would like to help him and he said but you don't have to come you can stay here and I'll come up and back you know and she said oh no wherever you're going I'm going so they all went down there my husband was the oldest in his family and they were there for years of four years that my husband spent in high school and my husband was always sickly he had asthma his whole life and there was a doctor down there that had helped him considerably and so he my father he thought a lot of might the doctor thought a lot of my father-in-law because he he had a testimony of what he was doing trying to help poor people in Georgia I mean they they were poorer than most people in the United States you know but anyhow then he felt like his he was finished there in Georgia and he wasn't burdened like he was at the first with what he was doing so he wanted to go back to Illinois and the doctor offered to send my husband to college and pay for it and so he was supposed to stay with them and the family was supposed to go back to Chicago but after his family left him down there with the doctor he just he was concerned he was as a just a 18 year old or 19 year old you know he was concerned about the things of the Lord and he just he just after a few weeks he thought this is not this isn't gonna work I want to be where my family is so he came back to Chicago and that's when we met and so I had never we were both out of Italian impending castle churches but the church I went to they were very they didn't fellowship with anybody they had their own rules and regulations and so they they just didn't fellowship you know they didn't want you to go to anybody else's meeting because you might lose what you have I don't know how you do that but anyhow that was their concept was not fellowship him with anybody and so my father-in-law had just been there a few months you know back in in the Chicago area and he visited our church and Dave was with him and my father knew him because they had actually been these two Italian churches had been one church back when my in-laws and my my parents were young people but there had been a split and so they they never fellowshipped or anything else they'd cross the street to avoid each other and things you know they just really got out of order so any any way but my father-in-law was very like I say he was very opened and he knew that wasn't the right right way to be and so he came one one week during the weekly service and and my father didn't know that he had returned from Georgia so he had told him that night well we'll come and visit sometime so that's what we did we to their house one time and and we I started fellowshiping with the his sister and cousins and stuff that I really hadn't known up until that time and so one of we probably started dating in January and of 5055 and we we only we went to church that was our dates we went to church service what's that you know extravagant like maybe today's life is but anyhow that's what we did and so eventually he brother branham came to town brother metson bros a was always very kind to brother branham he really loved brother branham and if it wasn't for brother bows a brother branham wouldn't have been backed up by anybody else in the city of Chicago I'm sure and so that was real blessing that God sent brother beause a there and and later later on his church put him out they actually took a man with the power around implant and that was out of a college hero some kind of a Bible College but it was it was a shame but brother Matt symbols they was a very good friend of brother branham's he really loved him with all his heart you could you can hear it on the tapes but I can tell you that I saw that there was there weren't any other ministers that did what rather math symbols they did so he so the first time I went to one of brother branham's meetings it was at Lane tech high school and that was a boys school there and I mean the crowds they didn't have any manners in those days they were just interested in getting in there and getting at the front you know either you know they had they wanted to be healed or you know whatever reason they wanted to be in the front row and they'd actually then they opened the doors you could have gotten trampled I mean they just went in and ran down the aisles you know to get a sight a seat in the places so it was you know it would be packed packed out and lame Tech had a balcony and we always sat in the balcony when we we went and I had a couple of experiences just sitting in the meeting in that balcony at Ling tech you know night there was just like a cloud raised up off the people and it was just in the air it was up right up with us in the balcony it was just beautiful it was just it was such a spirit of the Lord there but you know the meetings themselves they were just wonderful I can't I don't even have words to express but I know that if you listen to the tape the Lord would reveal that to you how wonderful it was to hear brother Branham himself and so then we started to we got married and we started to go to Jeffersonville whenever we could but at that time we didn't have too much money not extra money to do things like that and so I sold my wedding rings so that we could go to Jeffersonville and and I never replaced him I have this nice ring on now which was my mother's my dad bought that for her when on their 30th anniversary but otherwise I've just had the band since that time I sold my my wedding rings to go to Jeffersonville but we we wanted to be in the in the meeting so bad and we had that we didn't have anything else we could sell and we had children wide array so we'd had to sell the children or something well he eventually I I had some female trouble and I had an operation and I mean it wasn't anything that was just you know gonna take my life but it was a nuisance and so I was operated on and after a few months I had the same condition back again and I went to the doctor and his solution was to operate again and I said no no we're not doing that I said I I I don't want to be operated on again I said it it you know we've done that and we have to come up with a better idea so he gave me some medication he gave me two medications that I never told my husband about because I was it involved me and being a female and I I just didn't talk about those things or we didn't talk talk about that so I was taking the medicine and then we happen to be able to go down to Jeffersonville so we went down there and Leo Mercer in Mo's that gene goad were in charge of setting up appointments you know for prayer with brother Branham er you know whatever was necessary and they took care of the tapes mailing them out and people who bought things and stuff you went through them and so Leo said would you like brother branham to pray for you you know Dave told him that I had this female problem and he said would you like brother branham to pray for you and he I said yeah that would be wonderful if he would so he called over there and asked if we could come over to brother branham's house and so they gave him a time for us to be there and there was also a brother that had come his name is Gerald Chauncey lives in Flagstaff Arizona now we never had met him he was just a young man he was younger than than we were and we were young Gerald had come from British Columbia and he had come by train and then I think he came to Chicago and then actually got on a bus and went to Jeffersonville anyhow he was there at the same time and he had come all that way for brother Brown if he was able to he wanted brother Branham to pray that he would receive the Holy Ghost just the just a young brother but a very lovely person and so brother Branham said we could come over to the den room so we went over there and they welcomed us into the done room and but brother branham didn't come in then I I don't I forget even how we we went into the done room I don't know if it was opened because we were coming and we walked in or I don't if somebody opened the door for us I don't remember that but anyhow we went in and we sat down and there was um I don't know if you've ever seen the house in Jeffersonville it's still the same house that brother Joseph lives in but it doesn't look the same you know they've redone it through the years and so it doesn't look the same anymore but there was an entrance I'm sorry an entrance into the this small den room that he had there added on to the house and so there was a little sofa at one end of it and Dave and I sat there and the other brothers just stood up brother Gerald and brother Leo Mercer they they were just standing up and then the door to come in from the house was over there and if you ever come to Tucson they have that same chair brother branham satin as in the den room now as he used to study in that chair so finally brother Branham came in and and sat down in that chair and he just you know kind of talked like he does on tapes to people to contact their spirit or see what the Lord is got in mind and so he sat in this chair and he asked us you know like where we were from and different things and you know where do you live and stuff like that he talked to brother Gerald and asked him some questions so then he got up from his seat in the corner there and the little sofa that my husband and I were sitting on had a coffee table in front of it and so he came and sat on the coffee table and we were knees to knees with brother branham and so then he asked you know what what the problem was and I told him I had this female trouble and I had been operated on and it was back again and the doctor wanted to operate again and I had refused to be operated on again I didn't want to do that so he said okay and then he yes brother Gerald you know why he had come and he said he wanted to receive the Holy Ghost and he said all right he said well let's all stand in a circle so we all stood in a circle and he began he talked to us for a very long time just on everything that we need we did we should do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said there's no other name the Bible says there's no other name and he said that that was very very important when we prayed to do everything in in Jesus name and so when when he started - oh and he my memory is not as good as it used to be well anyhow he asked us if we had ever seen how the hand ministry worked cuz for a time in the campaigns he would use the hand ministry and it was this part of his hand that got spots on it and he told us that while he was talking to me he told me he said took my hand in his hand and it was just like white spots and they just would like fade and come back and fade and come back and he said this isn't something that will take your work your life sister like it wasn't as bad as maybe I was thinking it was and he said in in the prayer lines like the worse the sickness the worst the spots were till like he said if it was a cancer that would get like leprosy this part of this part of his hand and he did that in some of the early meetings that's how he discerned after some time and then I I would just guess like seeing mine was a private interview that he probably did that for other people too that that that showed him what the disease was so he he asked my husband if he had something he wanted to be prayed for and he he said you know I thought he was maybe sick also or something he said well I have asthma brother branham and he said uh that's just the devil and I and I know he told other people that too one had one of my friends had a very sick child that had asthma and he told the mother the same thing that the mother was my friend and she said that's what brother branham told me she said I was sitting in the car with them because he was so sick and the dad had gone in to be prayed for or something and she sat with the boy and because they didn't want to disturb anything but then brother Branham came out to her in the car and greeted her you know he must have said my wife is out in the car with the with the boy and he prayed for the little boy but he told her the same thing that's just the devil it's all sickness anyhow yeah he when he took my husband's hand it didn't show any any illness like that asthma and stuff didn't show up on his head and I mean he had serious problems with asthma because when we were first married I I am an only child and I I just didn't know anything I was always with my mom and dad wherever they went I went and and I just didn't have any very much knowledge of anything and his first asthma attack Dave had asthma from the time he was born and the first asthma attack he had we had this little basement apartment and I was running all over the house I didn't know what to do you know I'll get a pillow get a blanket raise your feet you know I mean I just didn't know what to do for the poor man and finally I was so frustrated I said is the only thing wrong is that you can't breathe and he he got so mad at me the adrenaline was running you know he was so angry with me he said yes I can't breathe he got over it so I did help them come back to the done room brother branham said that he was going to have a Oh David he asked Dave if he had something he wanted him to pray for and Dave had this job in an office Dave thought office help was the worst possible job you could have he said they have too much time on their hands and they they just are nasty thinkers you know they just think evil all the time and they actually had a thing in this office in brother branham talks about it on on tape cuz Dave didn't Dave told him what they did on the weekend they threw all the keys on the table brother Branham says this on tape they throw the keys on the table and they pick up a set of keys and go home with that woman or man other than their husband or wife you know they would do that well they knew that aggravated Dave you know but they you know once they know a little something about you you know they just make life miserable you know any time they can so he told brother branham he didn't tell brother branham what they did he just said I don't like my job because they're very filthy minded and he said I i'd like you to pray that I'll get a new job so when brother branham prayed for all of us he didn't pray that Dave would get a new job he prayed that he'd be satisfied until the Lord had something for him and he never did leave that job til we left Illinois yeah but he said he was able to go there and do his work and it wasn't not the same like it was before you know what he said it was like torment it's going to his job you know so then he he told told me that it you know that I would be all right and he told brother Gerald that he'd received the Holy Ghost before he went home but back to Canada so then the brothers were talking and thing okay what forget oh yes he had to talk to us for a long time like I said about doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so when he prayed he prayed in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost in the name of the holy roman church and you know he he mentioned so many things you he could just click things off real fast and then he finally he said in the name of the lord jesus christ and that he had my hand and he said you all watch my hand so he had my hand and has in that's still where all these little spots are going around and even when he said in the name of the lord jesus christ that stopped that's completely stopped you know so he told brother Gerald he'd received the Holy Ghost before he left Jeffersonville to go home and so then the brothers were talking and I was the only woman in the room so I felt kind of I didn't know what to do with myself so I went by the door and I stood there and the brothers were still talking and brother branham was talking to them and then he left and he came to me at the door he said now sister the Lord has healed you he said he told me exactly the medicines I was taking and I hadn't even showed them to my husband because they were just personal it was a female problem and it was kind of personal and I was embarrassed even to talk to him about what the doctor had given me and so I I just hadn't even told him so nobody in the room knew but me what the medicine was he told me exactly what the medicine was and so but for a long long long time it never dawned on me that he treated me just like he did the people in the prayer line because he he told me exactly what was going on and nobody else knew that nobody in the in the room and he said you can take the medicine or not take the medicine but the Lord has healed you so I didn't take the medicine I praise the Lord I don't need it so that was that was a wonderful thing no no no no I never had that issue again the Lord took that completely away yeah well then several years later then my mother-in-law started through met apposite and it was she started into menopause around the time of the church age meetings and we weren't able to go down at that time to the church age meetings but my mother-in-law and father-in-law had gone down and brother Branham prayed for her at that time but she just she just couldn't seem to get well you know even though brother Branham had we were glad brother Branham had prayed but she she said she when she did get well she said she knew when that thing that spirit came on her the neighbor man died of cancer and that spirit came on her and on her mind until she thought she had cancer I mean she was convinced she didn't care what the doctor said or anything you know and she had a small growth the doctor removed that it was not cancer and we did everything we could you know for her which then she just went into a terrible terrible depression and she couldn't take care of her family she I had a one of my sister-in-law's was only eight years old at the time this happened to my mother-in-law and she was a change of life baby and and she just she just got worse and worse and then my father-in-law he was you know he'd work all day and then mom would keep him up all night and it just was very difficult so my sister-in-law and I we would take turns taking mom and and trying to watch over and care for it because it it got pretty pretty bad sometimes but she just she just couldn't get over this well finally my father-in-law from all the stress had a heart attack and he was in the hospital and so my husband said he thought he'd take his mom back down to Jeffersonville and see if he could get an appointment and see brother branham so he took her down and and he got a an audience with brother Branham and he said brother Branham came in the room and he you know greeted them and you know I asked him where they were from and everything and and so they talked a little while you know and just about coming that they lived in Chicago and that he had meetings there you know and brother Branham was telling them different things and then he finally he said to my mother-in-law he said what seems to be your problem sister and she said the devil tells me that I'm not saved and don't have the Holy Ghost and he said why do you listen to him simple simple but says she had never been like that she was a very faithful believer in the Lord Jesus Christ you know that was just a trick of the devil that it tormented her mind I mean she was in torment if I could have a movie of how even just how she looked you'd know right away something bad wrong was her you know she had something bothering her but that was it she thought she had done something to lose their salvation and the Holy Ghost and so he told her to just go back home do what she didn't want to do you know take care of her little girl make suppers you know make breakfast bake a pie you know just do the normal things and he said if you if you don't know what to do he said just go out on your back yard and dig a hole and fill it up he said to keep busy that's one thing nervous people can't do they can't keep busy that you know the devil just runs them around until they're just they can't work it can't do anything and she was very capable she was and she was a fine Christian woman you know it's not like the reason you you're like this is because you know you've done the sand the sand uh she was she was a good Christian woman so anyhow she was she was sick for almost two years bad bad sick we had to just take her house to house and so okay right during that during that interview brother brother branham told her he got a piece of paper with a pencil he made a straight line and he said this is the road to eternal life and he said we all get on this road at a different time and he said whenever we're born into this world and received the Lord as our Savior we get on this road and he said once you get on this road you can't get off wonderful news it's wonderful news you know so when when my husband came home and told us what brother branham said oh we were the happiest people in the world we didn't care what mom did after that it was like this is over with you know we we had no doubt that it was gonna turn out right you know cuz he she had yes he told her that it was meta pause and then and that was a comfort to me also because I thought Oh menopause well you just go through menopause eventually matter pause ends you know so I thought well it's just something normal you know and and it'll be over with but it it took about two years and he told her that it would take eighteen months I think to 24 months I heard 20 months to 24 months or something like that but it's on a tape on have you got it well when the Lord okay taxol he's they we all get on it at a different time when we're saved and he said once you get on this you can't get off then he put his hand over the line of the paper and the the line he'd drawn on it and it made a shadow over that line and he said you're just under a cloud in a storm he said but you're not off the line you're not off the line you know sometimes we just we get perplexed over a lot of things that maybe we have to go through temporarily or something but he said that you know it was just a cloud covering it didn't change our spiritual condition at all we're still so you're still saved and you still have the Holy Ghost but you get so nervous that you think you've lost that or something you know or the Lord took it away or something but he doesn't do those things he doesn't take that away yeah yes the there's two oddball tapes and the one he speaks about my mother-in-law is the one from Jeffersonville in all her life she was joining the curve she had no peace presidents ago teachers heard from her corset is a mental all of a sudden it returned with great she went oh yeah it was she was on her way at the time she was healed she was on her way to wedding in a car that he had taken a trip from Arizona they were going to a wedding in British Columbia and they were just riding in the car another couple and his wife were they were driving and my mother-in-law and father-in-law were sitting in the backseat and all of a sudden she turned to my father-in-law and she said Dave I have my right mind back she knew and that spirit left her she knew in that spirit left it just left and she felt and then when they got to the wedding oh my goodness she was they were staying in this house with friends and she was taking the sheets off the bed all the women were on like the first floor and all the brothers were staying down in the basement because they didn't have money really to take the trip but he be there for the sweaty so the these people offered their home and there wasn't enough room for everybody they just just slept on the floor and everything else but the brothers were in the basement I think and they were up on the first floor where the bedrooms were but she had everybody laughing and she was taking the sheets and making wedding gowns for everybody you know and just because she was so happy when that happened to her she knew when that left she knew then and I've heard other people talk about when they've had a mental thing that when that left the same thing happened they knew immediately that spirit left yeah okay did I forget something else okay he was wrong was that he was he was the groom at that time they were going to that wedding so any Oh sometimes you don't have too much wisdom anyhow I prefer living in a group in the Prescott and so brother branham had agreed to go hunting with the brothers well the leadership that we had at that time they decided that they were going to take the sisters and the brothers and you know they had two huge tents and all the women were in one tent and all the men were in the other tent and they had made a small tent for brother Billy and brother Joseph and so we were just thrilled to have him one-one actually when brother branham got there I think he was a little bit surprised there were so many people and that there were women there you know I mean it's it's a hunt and the women we weren't hunting we were the workers but anyhow in the morning I was you know trying to help get things ready you know for a breakfast and everything else and then we were just waiting on other things to happen before we could eat this breakfast and I was standing at the fire cuz brother branham had been walking around and I thought maybe I could talk to brother branham you know and but I didn't really know what to say to him you know I just was so thrilled that he was there so I said brother branham I said that tape on marriage and divorce I said that was a really hard tape on the women hoping he'd say something encouraging to me about how nice the women were he just looked at me and he said sister never forget that the woman is the weaker vessel so that straightened me out [Laughter] another time he was hunting with the folks that group in prescott that we were in we had gone to a hunting area that was very close to where we lived and brother branham came up to hunt with the brothers and the sisters brought out a very big dinner you know like Thanksgiving dinner to where we were hunting and brother branham couldn't get over it you know that it was all laid out on the table that I mean he had to eat on your lap but you know all the food they had and everything for him he was very nice about it and they wanted him to go first and they you know they finally they someone prayed and you know and I'll go first for the Branham and but do you know that he talked to different people and they started through the line and he ended up being the last person he never went to that table till everybody had gone through that line very humble very humble never thought he was never made you feel like I'm a very important person you know the Lord has sent me never never like that never like that he was a real servant true servant and so I'm the same hot tears too later they were getting ready to go out and uh another brother and sister that had been from Chicago too but they had moved out and they were part of this group the husband and wife were together and I was there and I was always kind of involved with the food what we were gonna eat and stuff like that and so I asked brother Branham if I could get him anything you know I said can I get something for you and he said no well I went got a glass of water and I asked you know I asked him if he'd like glass of water so he he took it from my hand and he said the Bible says that if you give a glass of water how does first go in the name of the Givaudan the water gives someone a drink that there's you receive a blessing from it I can't think of the scripture right now but it is a scripture that's you know if you give this drink and he's to the least of them and he said I'm the least when I handed him he quoted that scripture and said I'm I'm the least you know never never never just just like your brother I think it was your brother in the Lord and he just treated you everybody the same everybody the same and I'm sure he knew who was naughty and who was nice you know he just you know he knew people who are not right you know and he probably had a correct a lot of people whether they received it or not that's something else but you know like me trying to start this conversation with them you know about I was trying to get him to ease up on the women a little bit you know by asking them like he was so direct about the women and everything and I said that was kind of hard and he said he didn't back off at all I said remember they're the weaker vessel brother branham was always always the same he loved children I never saw him pass by a child that he didn't greet her you know just said look at this or something you know maybe their hair or their eyes or something you know yes when he came to visit us in this group that we were in in the we called it the park because we were in a trailer park and it was quite large and at the time we arrived there and in Prescott really families came in you know like maybe one at a time but this man had enlarged his trailer park and he had like two sides there was a little creek that ran through the thing and so one side of the creek was established and then he added this other across the creek he added this other section and all of us were in that had it on section so and we were free to have our services and things like that and so it worked out good and the children all got to be together there were some very nice things about it and then there were some things that shouldn't have been so eventually it it broke up the Lord the Lord has his time to do everything and so yes that time he came the one time he well he came more than once but the one time he came he went house-to-house and prayed with every family and their children you know to took us in a circle like when he was at our house he took us in a circle and prayed for all of us but I also say that it wasn't because we deserved it we needed help brother brother branham knew that you know we didn't know it but brother Branham knew that we needed we needed help and I really appreciate that and after that when that broke up we went through a lot of hardships in life but God was good it's always good he's good to us sleeping me okay my husband my husband had a job so that we could go to Jeff a little bit more often than we would have been able to he got himself a part-time job on Saturday working for Sears and so for a while he worked in them he worked at some action that you know there wasn't many people around and your salary did have to do with how much you've sold so he I mean it was better than no money but you know he wasn't satisfied well an opening came in the car department and car parts and tires and batteries and stuff like that so he asked if she could be transferred out there because that was a going thing all the time you know people were coming and going and buying expensive things you know battery was more expensive than what was sold in the department he was in and so he he'd worked there and we'd use that money to go to Jefferson and I'd pick him up 4:30 on Saturday and when he got off and then we just start from the Sears store to go down to Jeff and we'd get there probably about midnight and and then we were there for Sunday morning service and then if we stayed for the night service we had to roll down the windows coming home and let that cold air and the car cuz we were so tired you know we hadn't had enough sleep you know you then you'd fellowship too much or I don't know if you can spell O ship too much but please you'd want to see everybody could see and talk to everybody you could talk to plus be in the services so we ride with the windows down going home because we and we'd get home about 5:00 in the morning and then he'd go to work Monday morning at 7:00 so that it was worth it yeah this is worth every every bit of it and I'm sorry that my memories are not like it used to be but I still can see those things in my mind you know it's just like I can't bring up little things that I've left out I think I've told it all but you pardon me but but that it was a wonderful wonderful thing I am so glad if I hadn't met my husband I probably well I'm God's child and he knew what I needed but I felt like I was doubly blessed by coming in contact with his family because they lit really loved the Lord and my mom and dad never did accept the message they weren't against it but they they didn't accept it he so it was you know I didn't have the fellowship with them that I had with my in-laws really very good people very good people and there's there's lots of wonderful people and the message that's it lots of things and although like all the things that all the believers that have been reached in in Africa I'm sure brother Branham is just all smiles with all the all the work that's been done over there because he had such a burden for the black people you know he he just you know they the ministers and everything in those days they just messed up everything you know where he couldn't even go where he wanted to go but the Lord found a way through the tapes and through missionaries and their own people testifying and that that's how it was meant to be and that's how it happened you know but brother Branham would have enjoyed that he would have liked to been been there and seen all of that I know he would have oh yeah that my husband while he was working for the Sears store he wanted to buy brother branham a gift and and my husband wasn't a hunter you know so he didn't know anything about hunting there or anything but he thought you know he knew they you would use a sleeping bag when he went hunting so he he bought this best sleeping bag they had and brought it down and gave it to brother branham as a gift and later on brother Billy Paul called I mean a long time not right away but you know like a couple years later brother Billy Paul called and wanted to know he said his dad bragged about it so much he wanted to know where Dave had bought it and and you know what all it was it was just from Sears Roebuck and it probably wasn't the best sleeping bag we could have gotten but you know we didn't know one sleeping bag from another but brother branham bragged on the bag like it was the best thing that had ever been made you know he just and I don't think brother Billy Paul could believe it came from Sears but he he brother brother Billy Paul told that to Grandpa Dave my father-in-law went down and they had a little interview some of the brothers from the group had gone down and when he found out that my father-in-law was there he says tell your son I pray for him every time I get in that bag we made it we made it yeah it was very very difficult and that's when we the group broke up and I he got sick in February I don't even know what year it was 75 ok 1975 he got sick in February and the first thing he did was he was on the way to Flagstaff from Prescott and all of a sudden like you just come into his his mind snapped or something and he thought he was Superman and could do anything with his car and he ended up running it off the road and nearly it nearly flipped and everything and then so then somebody who saw the like an accident happen happening they called the police and so the police were there right away he was all alone in the car now we didn't know this was going on we thought I thought he was going to Flagstaff to see about the work that we had up there which I think that really was what he was going for but somehow his mind snapped and so then when the police got there he's still in this condition and he thinks he and take that police gun and shoot him and then raise him from the dead oh yeah he just I mean it's just amazing what the enemy can do too you know but the Lord helped us in quite a few people from the group there about half went to New York City where yeah half of them they well they they went to fellowship with the people from New York City but they actually started out someplace in Indiana didn't they with another brother that had fellowship with the people in New York and then the other part of the people went to Flagstaff Arizona and and I didn't know what to do because he was sick he couldn't make decisions and I really didn't want to follow the leader and so I I did go to a Flagstaff meeting they had a little convention and we went up there we had returned from Illinois because he Dave I mean he he knew he had to work you know he said I've got to get back to work I've got to take care of my family I've you know but he he couldn't he was just wiped out and you know maybe doing bizarre things and so it just it was very difficult but anyhow I took him back home I in he got sick in this accident thing where he tried to was thinking about grey grabbing the gun and shooting the officer happened in February well by April I didn't know you know he wasn't any better and I didn't really know what to do so I thought I'll just go back my parents lived and we're from it originally from Chicago so I said I called my mom and dad and I said date you know Dave's been very sick I said okay if I come home with him and he said yeah that that was fine with them so we went and we left grandma the one who had been so sick she lived with us then my father-in-law had passed away and she lived with us and so she stayed and watched the children for us and we told her that when school's out for her to come she had quite a few relatives all of her her sisters and brothers lived in Chicago there and to come with school's out with the children and then she could have a visit with her family and we'd had the we'd be at my mom and dad's so that that's what we did we had a dog at that time and and this we didn't know what to do with this dog but we were so in love with it we thought we had to take it everywhere we went so the kids and Grandma came on the train and Paul our boy was about 15 16 years old I think was he he was 18 then okay anyhow he he took him to the vet and the vet gave him some medication and and the dog came by plane but grandma and the kids had come by train oh my that then that we were we were just there till July when they felt you know like he said we I have to get back to work I have to do something you know and he did he tried very hard sometimes he was successful and sometimes wasn't and so anyhow I went to they had a little convention up in Flagstaff and I went up there and I met brother Mark andhe and I met brother Perry Greene and they knew Dave had been very sick and they said you know they were willing to help us if we wanted to come to Tucson so then I took that as from the Lord and that's how we ended up in Tucson so I mean originally we came to Arizona just because we felt like brother branham was going to eventually be in Arizona and we thought maybe we could be some part of his ministry you know maybe help in meetings or something like that that didn't work out but you know the Lord the Lord was with us yes the Lord healed him it was took four years but if the Lord had healed him and he he healed them instantly my father was visiting at the time and Dave just came in from work he had gotten himself two jobs you know to kind of try to catch up on everything that was back slid you know from not being able to take care of it and my father was visiting at the time and he came in from his night job one morning and he he came through the back door I can still see him up at that door and my dad was sitting on a sofa UPS at the door he said dad I'm healed just he knew that lifted off of them it's it's just amazing if you see someone that is so so sick and so not not how they the Lord meant them to be or anything the Lord didn't mean for them to be that way it was just the enemy that did that and and then when that spirit left did the same person again you know they they loved the Lord I mean even when while they're sick they loved the Lord but they just can't operate because the enemy's got them derailed temporarily you know but he was so thrilled when that lifted off of him he just and many people there and to son at that time when when the Lord delivered him I said now I want you to meet my husband because they real I said you never really knew this man you know loved it when he was delivered I said you really didn't know him you'll see a different person thank you very much I never did this before I'm sorry I'm so slow [Applause] I like it brother Rams character when she gave him the water and as much you've done to the least of these my brethren you did it to me that's what Jesus said again just to remind you of a sermon that I preached a while ago concerning going to hell not because of what you did because of what you didn't do and Jesus said as much you've done it to the least of these you've done it to me then he said in as much you didn't do it to the least of these you didn't do it to me and he said depart from me into everlasting fire amen so they went to hell because not because of what they did because of what they didn't do they meant and our sister did do what Jesus said and the prophet of God acknowledged it that he was the least and she did as it were on to the least that she was thinking she were doing it to the to the best of the greatest but the problem of God considered himself to be the least and then as much you've done it to the least of these my brethren you've done it to me in his touch you did it to me to brother Branham he considered himself to be the least a man you did it onto the Lord but she highlighted brother Browns humility then he was a humble man yes he was and after he's going many many acknowledged William Branham to be a humble man but if they acknowledged him to be a very sincere man they knew that he was real he was sincere but he was humble he didn't boast he wasn't there to to present himself he was there to present the Lord he was there to I like to the Lord Jesus Christ but what struck me when she was talking about brother Browns humility was this message humble thyself it was a message the Prophet preached in 1963 a man highlighting humility he said if you'll read the little book of Jude you'll just learn a whole lot now what our brother Vale said I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said they got away from it he said I'm a man of corrupt mind and so forth had come in and beguiled them away from the real things of God and he said God can only operate as we let him operate I can only do for us with us in US and through us what we allow him to do it's not what we think is what God thinks a man and he said if you want power he says see how humble you can get a man and he said just get away from all the worldly thinking and humble yourself before God Amen brother sister we are sinners saved by grace there's not one of us that would deserve it any more than others a man oh well I'm better than this one I'm better than that one no you're not in the eyes of god you're all sinners in the eyes of god you're all morning seeing shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies a man all in need of grace you know a brother's sister I pray God got helpless to see see ourselves as God sees us amen sinners saved by grace oh but we are righteous in Christ yeah but that's grace that he imputed to us the righteousness of Jesus amen issue and it's the result of your humility you humble yourself to that revelation by the grace of God he said see you commit yourself to Christ to humble yourself before him he said that's really power he said you show me a church that's humble real humble and he said not ever you see a church just a sweet humble church and I'll show you a church said as the favor and power of God in it that's right just the thing that it takes humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise he said no he said above all things it's our individual souls that were responsible before God if you're going to heaven it isn't whether I go or egos it's you going and you first and you've got to look this out and come sweet before the Lord and I've always found out that the man that umbels himself is the man that God exalts and when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything and you can't tell him nothing he is arrogant well he said that's the person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that almost himself and walk sweetly that's the one that God takes he said I find a man to be a shepherd that has no reputation in all denomination that he said that's just good real good and genuine sweet humble brother that lives the life praise the Lord brother you might be able to talk to doctrine but what about lived the life that's right there are many that can talk it and are talking it the message but not living it brother what God is looking for is the life of the of the doctrine the life of the word a man is not not even you can get even quote the text a quote that the the the the the letter of it can you live the like the dynamics of it a man the probably gods that were putting too much emphasis on the mechanics and he said not enough on the dynamics that's the truth praise the name of the Lord if there's anything our sister witness in the Prophet she witnessed a man she witnessed the dynamics of the robbed the word a man everybody's living itself out through a man and he wasn't he wasn't exalting himself he was giving preeminence to the Lord to his word a man and to the sons and daughters of God and he considered himself to be the least of all he did he really did thank God and God was able to use that man to do what he did and I'll tell you it's going to take the same kind of a bride for God to use to bring the rapture to climax the rapture and the resurrection amen if we are anywhere right now we are at the climax of the resurrection and the rapture what else is there to come to pass what else are you looking for what else is there for God to do according to what God has done the only thing left is the resurrection and rapture is anything the prophet of God was looking for when God took him even when God took him from from the off the earth brother he was looking for the resurrection and the rapture he felt that that that was it was close well brother that was over fifty years ago so how close is it tonight grace to us grace that we're not going to miss it oh yeah they'll know about it there'll be a generation that knows about it but they're gonna miss it that's why the Bible says you're going to say where's the rapture still it already happened you didn't know it brother it's revealed to the right don't ignore it focus on it but your thoughts on it but your faith in it the resurrection to rapture rather I tell you if you're Brian if you're really bright ordained for the resurrection rapture I tell you you're you're hungry and thirsty for the fellowship of the saints who are going on and if you're not there's something lacking in our relationship with God the poverty God said when you get to that place it is not resurrection time not rapture time you get to that place where you're hungry in your thirst and you're longing for those that are gone on you said that means you're getting too close to the place where you're going to go you're gonna go and be with them because you're longing for it you're hungry important to 34th and the prophet of God was like that before God took it but the bride is going to be like it before the resurrection and the rapture yeah you're gonna be longing for the Saints that you had fellowship with and they're gone on well it's coming to the resurrection time the rapture time and the evidence of it in your life and in our lives is we all Lord we miss these brothers and sisters we want fellowship with them we want fellowship we want fellowship amen keep calling for keep honking for it to keep thirsting for it and to finally the rapture the resurrection of the rapture is going to climax amen almost longer how much longer if the bubble goes to the third Pole was the rapture rapturing faith to give us rapturing faith and much longer sit but the people are too much caught up with this world and they're not there not to that place where they were they're willing to let go of the natural things of life they're focusing too much on the natural things of life we are they're doing this doing this doing this focusing let's focus on of that brother-sister throw it aside let's focus on the rapture let's focus on the resurrection by the grace of God again the public God said they are waiting on us and God is waiting on us where we there's many waiting for God to do this waiting for God to do that God's waiting on you to do it why because he gave you the faith for it go do it the rapture so we can't blame God no sir god help us that we're gonna be believing for the change and he said humble brother that lives the life a man not he says some big know-it-alls coming in put in this order this be this way cutting things drag around he said he said I said it'll never work he said you've got it'll never work he said you've got to let go and he said see the main thing is love God humble yourself with it and he's you know I understand all the mysteries of God still though I could do it and have not charity I am nothing I ain't got nowhere to go yet the main thing is love God just think of that you can understand all the mysteries you can understand all the doctor you can that paid to do this and paid to do that but I don't have divine love you said it profits me nothing it's all being it's all being first Corinthians 13 why is it me because brother it's not it's not just knowing this and knowing this and knowing that it's loving God and wanting to get back with God and fellowship with God and worship God amen face to face so because why God is love o to a lot of people got his doctrine God is this God is that it becomes a God to the people that's right it is they because doctrines become idolatry oh yeah brother God did all of that everything revealed all of that to reveal his character so that we would love him for himself and we would want to be with him by the grace of God the main thing is love God and humble yourself surely after all these years on the field and around the world seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in and if you want to get somewhere with God never let you an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let malice come in no matter what anybody does if they're wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person he said you be sweet and kind to them remember God loved you when you were in sin and he said if the Spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's wrong and just pray for them and love one another above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another God will bless it and it's hard telling what he will do usually when a church begins to get in numbers and get to getting a little bigger something like that they get away from the real real thing love you know they get into doctrine theology but brother where's the love of God in it if there's anything that God has revealed to Washington through the Ministry of William Branham it's love it's love the prophet of God Himself showed that love amen by the grace of God I pray God help us Lord that we got the word but I trust Lord that it's all crowned with divine law amen did your life is crowned with the baptism of divine law the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine love why because God is love now human love divine law you can be nice I was a nice person they said that now God got it looking for love not just to be good nice and kind love Devine a man brother that's what that's what brought Christ's other seeing was low that's why Jesus did what he did was love he loved us amen and doing it he would produce love in any sons and daughters that we would love him back not God love him because we got to love him no no no no this is why this is why he's allowed all this to happen from Genesis right on down to Revelation what for to producing us real love to love him for himself not because we got to but because we see him and didn't know him is to love him when you see his character and his nature you see what he does see how he acts and so on and say let's see how He loves you you love him Lord I'm a sinner I love you so I've redeemed you Lord I know I consider what you did thank you for such love and you were loving back by the grace of God amen thank our sister amen for what she did and I I did have the oddball sermon here too so thank the Lord and I was brother Joseph read its quote from there was it yeah a man and he mentioned systematizing very good thank the Lord so thank the Lord for His grace toward us please let's love this love him you can't love me I can't love you the way that God wants us to without the baptism of divine Don a man so the grace of God be with us brother amen let's stand they're saying to praise the Lord to God be the glory return to our brother mark and to say God bless our brother and sister baguette and our sister Petoskey for a testimony to God be the glory wonderful and praying the grace of God to continue
