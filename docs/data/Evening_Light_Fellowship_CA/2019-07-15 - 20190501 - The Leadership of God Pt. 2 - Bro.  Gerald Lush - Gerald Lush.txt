but Christ will soon appear to catch his bride away all tears forever over in God's eternal day a man was seen of times the day seems our tribe it was hard we're tempted to complain to but priceless

run it a man because there are issues that we have to deal with in the race there was an enemy there to hinder us in the race the slowest down in the race maybe the district is not our attention but to put us on the wrong path amen so let's make sure that we're under again as we've been ministering on the right leadership amen so you're going to stay on the correct path by the grace of God so grace to be with us as we go further into that thought on the leadership of God and want to thank the number of the Saints that that appreciated the Ministry of the word on Sunday morning a man and for what it did for them and what they learned from the message on the leadership of God we're going to continue with it a million because of anything that we need to be sure of in this day and in this hour is that where they were under the right leadership because this is the hour this is the time that we've been warned of and all generations have been warned of it concerning the deceit false prophets false apostles false ministries amen to the play they got to the place as I said they got to the place where Jesus was put out of the church a man is there in Revelation three he's outside knocking on the door of the church you think he'd be inside no he was outside a man because they refused him they refused the full revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ is not what he wanted to do is what they wanted to do a man again it's man doing what's right in his own eyes not in the eyes of God and brother what does he come under he came under the leadership of the devil a man so again remember the Bible warned us that even Satan's angels are preaching the gospel amen oh yeah that's that's right there in the scriptures so brother we we ought to make our calling and election sure by constantly learning up with the word making sure we're in line with if in line with making sure that we have the leadership of God not the leadership of the devil amen making sure we're going to stay in the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth not 99% of it but honor to present amen because it's in this brilliance reserver in our ever an age that God is testing that faith if this are a man whether or not we're going to stay with one under percent of the revealed word amen or at least have that desire in our hearts and in our souls we're going to stay with the word by the grace of God I want to make sure that what I do and what I think and how I act and how I react it's going to be according to the will of God it's going to be according to God Christ in me the home of Laurie because there's a tremendous statement that it will Paul cities that has not me that lives this Christ that live within me a man so brother sister in the in what you're thinking and in what you're doing and how you're doing is that Christ a man is that the way Jesus were thinking is that the way Jesus which we would say it is this the way Jesus would do it a million not the devil well there's as well as I said an ounce on Sunday this is only deceived Eve in the Garden of Eden a man he gave it all he did was had one word he was acknowledging the rest of it but he had in one word yeah and God said Eve said mentioned and we should not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he's a work we wit will die if we did and sayings that you shall not surely die a man so mother God says they would surely die but Satan just had in one word thou shall not surely die and again he took them a little higher said I'll give you if you do and you're going to living to be as gods he said knowing good and evil well we don't need to know it and they didn't need to know it a man but God allowed it and God permitted it because he had a reason and in a man God had a plan so both sister let's be on our guard in this day in this hour in this age amen because brother God is bringing his plan doing in a man what God started ending amen the Alpha now is the Omega the brother ET bravery by the side of eternity allowed us to drop down into time but now he's taking us some time back to eternity amen and whether the devil has come down knowing this time is short as I said brother of all that god that's going on in this day in this hour it look look at the good who got faith the devil got faith he got the revelation that his time is short and I really know that he knows that according to what's going on and na knows that it's prophesied right here in the word a man oh brother the devil knows the word the devil knows where God said it's going to happen in the last days this is going to happen that's going to happen a man is going to get so bad then are they and so deceiving and all these things well I am brought over into what were in that world now where would you see the very like everywhere possible and I and I highlighted some of the things I wonder one do it again tonight but I highlighted to what's going on in the world and who and when and even even science even technology and even not your politics and even their were their concern their concern about what's going on because it is serious it is serious this is not as I said there's another world but I used to say this is not the world I lived in when I was born these are not the world that I lived in when I was when I was maybe 20 years old when I was thirty years old when I was hoarding when I'm 70 now and answer this is not the world that I lived in when I was 60 69 a man this is not the way I lived in when I started my 70th year no siree because everything is changing so much and so quickly and that's why the bejeezus said he's gonna he's going to cut it short and a quick short work he was going to do a man now a quick in the eyes of God not quick in your eyes because when it comes to being quick and our eyes we think is going to be oh it's going to be just so long but no I remember one day with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day so as God's time is not our time a man we think it's a long time since the Prophet has gone and with our time with the calendar that we're using and in today it does seem that a man because we assume we've gone over six thousand years but we're not a men that that's the Roman calendar a man and that that's took us to the sea but brother we're going to go according to the Jewish calendar there's about another 225 years to the to 6,000 a Maya because people think where's the millennial reign because this is now 2019 and with before before Christ came it was 4000 years now well over 6,000 no no no no they lived let's go according to the Jewish calendar not the Roman calendar amen and it still 225 years left but God is going to shorten time for the bride a man so brother and we can see because everything is changing so quickly and so seriously amen so you young people be on your guard this is not the way that you lived in when you were born amen and it's definitely not the world that you lived in just a few months ago because everything is changing you know day after day after day after day whether we have we know that everything that they used to happen occasionally years ago is happening almost every day amen when it comes to fate even when it comes to basic things like a fire or an accident or a plane crash or or this is going on murder it all used to happen you know once in a while but now is happening constantly amen why because the devil has come down why knowing is time is short a man so please in the name of the Lord listen on does not think think like the world thinks there's not I play the world lacks there's no that's not that's not more real what we're looking like in the eyes of the world what it look like in the eyes of God amen what does God think about you not about what the devil thinks about you what your neighbor thinks about you what does God think about you a man who is leading me I trust where the grace of God - knowing that is its God that's leading us it is Christ in us the hope of glory by the grace of Almighty God amen well your sister was your life today a reflection of Christ in you a Maya is your reflection in this service tonight is there's a revealing Christ in you amen brother is serious now the devil in Yorba Christ in you now certain of one thing you know Christ influencing you whether if it is is going to be a right attitude a right spirit right motive great objections is all it's going to be you want to give the preeminence to God Alleluia you're going to give the prayer ministry the Lord Jesus Christ amen you're gonna have that smell of that attitude you're going to yes I'll be willing to lay down my life amen God wants to come right now and they were in the next second come Lord a man led the dead in Christ living to this dimension amen amen in the glorified bodies and we'll be with the radio laughter hey man when are worried about all week now wait Lord bilious wait till ideas we toy now I experience this a man whether that means heaven is not real here this was more real to you and this life is more real deal then the eternal life but all right so so you've got such an experience of Jesus and that you've been truly honestly absolutely born-again and if you're born again whether you realize that we are pilgrims and we are strangers in this world Amen that we are we were not customized to this world a man but being born together customized to eternity but yet whether there are too many believers that are too satisfied with this world they're too content with what's going on in this world I play their guard grace of God help us whether amen there we are sure that we are new creatures in Christ amen and has not me that lives as Christ liveth in me amen and he's proven he's in you and he's in me by the spirit and the attitude that we am a man and we're now looking for the foolishness of this world we're looking for eternity with Jesus it's Jesus more real to us than the churches it's easily more real to us than the Pope is Jesus more less than other religious leaders and other preachers brother I pray that Jesus is more real amen than anybody else in this world I don't care who it is while they are a man is Christ we're married to Christ and he's getting to a place now where our spiritual life is going to be more important than our natural one amen because any man till you will come to the place that Jesus came to oh yeah I have is Christ in you you'll come to it you'll have the attitude Jesus and amen he had that attitude in the Alpha early I'm Cherie Olivia that same attitude in the Omega a man in this hour in you and he made what attitude how long shall I be with you and where am I going to be in this world Lord we want to get out of here I pray God that whatever he's going to let happen that he's going to let it happen so to make life make the natural life miserable amen oh yeah he's going to do that make the light net to bring out what's in us amen they'll bring out the true leadership the whatever leaders who were under whether it's Jesus or whether it's the devil amen he's going to let it get worse and worse and worse and harder and harder and harder amen it was getting harder for Jesus amen because he was encountering more and more unbelief amen and so you and I are encountering more and more unbelief in this old world amen and we'll had the same that we will say what Jesus said how much longer should I be with you why because they're getting more and more believing a man we pray the grace of God amen oh there those are there they're looking for something else I met him I've experienced him but again we got to realize that's the foolish virgin and one day they're gonna come we're wet braid we're not over there with that and with that with that bunch we're bride we're separated a million there and even the foolish virgin are separated but the bride has got a greater separation onto the Lord amen because they're good they're going into a tribulation but the bride is going into a rapture by the grace of God so god help us brother I much like with that we all had that same attitude that Jesus had that you're not going to be content with the world you want to get you're gonna you want to get out of it amen I trust a new birth amen the new birth is giving you the experience of eternity by the grace of God hallelujah god help us who grow as we go further into the word concerning get the leadership of God amen now all the way down through since the fall in the Garden of Eden there's been two two leaders there's been God and Satan a man they made that deal with it all the way down through Jesus dealt with it the church's dealt with it and now you and I are dealing with it amen praise the name of the Lord because we're now we're in fellowship with Christ and brother he was put out of the church and if he came back in it's just with you with the elect amen any man he's not going back into the rest of the church does just those that want him if you open the doors and I'll come in and fellowship with you and you with me will something together amen it's the rapture praise the Lord it's the marriage supper of the Lamb grace to help us in this late late hour if Satan got that faith that time is shortened he's come down with great wrath and we're seeing it but God has come down with great love amen to lead us into glory

make our anointing Shore in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ loving please love Jesus with all your heart they're saying now I believe [Music] all washable [Music] all things are possible because we believe our Lord Jesus Christ a man and a man praise the name of the Lord hallelujah god bless you turn with me to the book of Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6 I didn't have the correct sheets of paper to print this on but I've just printed a few copies to those that maybe don't have it I printed it some years ago and it is a word to the church and it is a quote of brother Branham from the fund of from the the message Christ the mystery of God revealed and it is counsel for the believers amen it's a word I would say to brendham Tabernacle a word to any message Church amen and also this other one that I did some years ago and it is with a quote character is a victory not a gift and you and on the other version that I printed this was more clear but it's a it's a an Israeli soldier and apparently he's walking through a military cemetery and you see a number of headstones there of soldiers that laid down their lives for Israel and character is a victory not a gift a man praise the Lord the grace of God that will lay down our lives for the gospel amen in Matthew chapter 6 and also to inform you that I did share it with somebody else and they were sort of shocked with it but after a ministry on Sunday I couldn't get away from the revelation of what I was what I administered on and what God had revealed to us and I the Lord sort of woke me around 6:30 Monday morning and I was it seemed like I would sleep but I was preaching and God was preaching to me God was dealing with me God was revealing things to me and I just couldn't couldn't get it get away from it and so he went on for about two hours or more as I was laying there in the bed and thinking I was asleep but I was somewhere else and and the Lord was taking me more and more into this revelation of the leadership of God it was tremendous so even when I woke up and even when I got up I still couldn't get away from it it was still with me so I feel that it's the Lord the Lord's will to continue the minister on this maybe for tonight and maybe again another service but we'll see as the Lord leads so it's like I said a lot of people don't understand the the the pressure and stress that the ministry is under that's if you're really in the spirit and you're really following God's leadership amen and that's why they're probably God said one time to regarding the the preachers he said he said they said why he said their wives he said our sisters he said I had to let their husbands if there are preachers he's to let him sleep at I'll sleep it off he stood on Monday he said because of the others distressed and the pressure that the Ministry of the word puts them under because we're now is not intellectual is spiritual a man because he's not coming out of the head it's coming out of the heart a man and God is taking control of the heart the soul God takes control of the human spirit God takes control of the mind a man and you're out of course when you get to the mind you're fighting the devil there and and so God takes control and moves the devil away amen so what for so the ministry continues on with the word thus saith the Lord so be in prayer as we go further into the words a night and I want to share with you the scriptures that I that I never got to on Sunday but in Matthew chapter 6 the Lord's Prayer and beginning to read at verse 9 jesus said after this manner therefore pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name his emphasis on the name not the titles but the name thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth that's in you now just see the earth oh there but in you because we were made of dust we come from it so he said again thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth well he's got to have someone to do it in a man that's right sister Justine praise the Lord and it says as it is in heaven that the will of God be done here as it is in heaven the will of God be done in your life as it is in heaven and it says give us this day our daily bread and it's the revealed word for this hour for the day in which you're living that's our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors amen now Justin financially natural money but spiritually amen forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors we owe something to others but we can they're rolling were they order us we need to do this for them but we want them to do that for us a man so this is what God is seen not just money and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil again that brother of another church asked me God leading us into evil no I said that's the devil does that I said lead us not into temptation and how is God going to do that deliver us from evil I said from what from the influence of the devil a man so I citizen gotten is not God leading us into evil I said buddy we're praying God deliver us from Satan's influence the leaders and evil well he said brother praise the Lord Alleluia he said you have given me peace he said I saw God was leading us into evil God was leading us into sin Noah says God permits that sometime but it's the devil so we're praying God don't let the devil Advan influence over me don't let the devil have an influence over us so as the delivery of some Satan's influence deliver us from Satan's leadership amen praise the name of the Lord so lead us not into temptation but the guys leadership and it says that deliver us from evil from the evil one from the devil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen and it says for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive the you a man we're praying for God's grace but you've got to show grace to others amen but he forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses god bless yous word you may be seated come with me to Exodus chapter 13 Exodus 13 I want to share with you the scriptures from the Old Testament into the new regarding leadership and when it comes to making your calling and election sure is making sure who's leading us morning noon and night in our thoughts in our words and in our deeds who is influencing us what power what anointing and what spirit amen and we feel that because we're in church that maybe this is God leading me because we're in church well the devil he also brings people to church a man he's there to find fault he's a he's there to weaken you he's there to challenge your faith is there to misinterpret the word that is going forth you know ii had a word here and had a word there a man in your thoughts but they've you if you're listening to the word out of your heart then brother you're not going to add to it you're not going to take from it you're going to say lord that's the truth that is the word help me to stay in line with the word out me to line up with the word and lord and if there's conviction a main in your heart they're going to say Lord forgive me and help me Lord not to do that help me in order to do what's right tell me to stay with what your stay with what you're saying amen and whenever and have your anointing by the grace of Almighty God so really I pray God to help us there's too much as I received an email today from somebody I might have been if they're in Florida I think and it's been some years and say I have that telescope with him and he said batteries that just let you know he said I'm still he's it in the word he says still staying with the message he said it's unfortunately but he said I guess you know as well that he said many that are walking away from it many said are not stained with the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but he said by the grace of God myself and my family he said are staying with it and I and he said we know and we're aware that it's going to get worse a man that is the brother even even in the in Florida that realizes what is going on I trust we realize what's going on what is it it is Satan deceiving the people in the follow he is leadership a man we might have said that under the leadership of God but end up under the leadership of the devil the church standard under under God's leadership we already went through that in the church ages and by the ended up under Satan's leadership Amen God said your year this year this year this from the birth date but then when he got into the last days he said oh you say you are rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing but he said I say unto you that your wretched your miserable your poor your blind you're naked in all the other ages there was something maybe positive but in the last days there was nothing positive everything was negative and and the worst part was that he was on the outside a man trying to get their attention by the revelation of his word just just as just think about that consider that again in Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14 Amen and then it says thus saith a the angel and the angel he named himself as the the a man of God meaning that it was to finish it was the end of all things a man and it was the end of the church ages so he was calling that he was calling the the elect there and he was calling the very elect out of the churches into out of the church age into the brain age by the grace of God so brother sister I trust that we are here tonight not because that then we oh that we're religious well because that we are the bride amen and that we have come out of the loudest see in church age and that we have coming to the bride age and in the right age the word revealed in the right age is giving us resurrection and rapture in faith and the word in the bride age is giving us the revelation that Christ has come for the bride the Lord has descended from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so brother that that's what's going on in the writings that is what you and I are entering into by the revelation of the word that's what you and I are believing and that's what we're believing for that's well you and I are hungry for and as well as you and I are searching for is the resurrection and the rapture amai and whether we have come to that place where morning noon and night we just can't forget it we can't get it out of our minds we can't get it out of our hearts out of our souls we can't get away from the hunger than the thirst a man that God through the revealed word as created in the right a my brother Martin Luther he had a hunger and a thirst morning noon and night for the revelation more and more of the revelation that you are justified by faith Wesley sanctified by faith because the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit any man you talk about a hunger and thirst morning noon and night they walked in this fear they lived in the spirit and like Luther the grocery the Pentecostals the old-fashioned Salvation Army old fashion or the churches ain't man they they they they weren't religious and and just going to church on his Wednesday or on a Sunday no no they they were in the spirit as seven days a week they're in the spirit 24 hours a day seven days a week amen they are and again they were new creatures they were absolutely born-again and the old worth it just a whatever was in the back but the new birth at preeminence amen and I trust by the grace of God that the old birth is behind us and the new birth has got the preeminence amen and if we reflect it and it is reflected in the lives that we live noon and night it is oh my god Elvis but I know that it'll upset the religious people because they're they they feel that you're hard to get hard to get your attention Amen that's that's the truth they feel oh you're you're well you're you're always on thinking about this you're always thinking about this and you want to do this and you want to do that Amen brother if you're in the spirit and you've been truly born again you want to love God you want to serve God and you want you want to worship God amen by the grace of Almighty God that's the truth that's the truth morning noon and night as I said he may even Wesley he would preach sometimes five times a day and whether we think oh well we worship on Wednesday night and we worship on a Sunday morning maybe we'll had to start Sunday evening service Amen by their sister and they were in the spirit listen let's get back to a Sunday evening service and why Amen because that's the Bible that scripture that's the instruction of the Bible concerning the last days and it says there says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and much more as you see the Day approaching and brother and we're not seeing much more we're seeing less that's right bill even we were getting together less believers were fellowship unless a man named Bo right here it is if their fellows have been left with one another their fellows I mean less were gone and that is the absolute truth well there's another anointing leading them in but is not God's anointing brother and I remember a brother some years ago that he that he preached on that dead text I believe the name in the book of Hebrews there but he started just a few verses before that and he said listen and he said I want to preach on he said a lettuce salad and and then they all laughed and they sent a letter salad yes he said I want to preach on a lettuce salad and it's let's see a way let's see today we're going to have a lettuce salad any-any ready in the book of Hebrews there there where the scripture was and it says led and concerning those that were living in this world walking in the spirit and it says let us let us let us one verse after another it was encouraging the believers to let us do this let us do this let us do that and adding any and he crowded with those two verses there and he said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and he said much more as you see the Day approaching amen so he said he said you take the lettuce salad and you're going to put this on the letter selling amen you want to pour this you want to mix this with it you want to mix that with it but he said this this is all we're going to mix these for this lettuce salad it's and let us through this let us through that little through that now he said much more as you see the Day approaching amen but we see the hour approaching where is becoming less and less and less amen why because they're not under God's leaders have any more than under the devil's leadership amen and the diligence wants you to be religious and/or you think about it sometimes once in a while you're thinking about it here and maybe you'll have a devotion and maybe you'll do your say a prayer or say grace you might as well talk to the devil because there is more and more and more than a they're there they're shameless Satan less and less and less with faith amen it's just religion it's just a form of godliness and they're denying the power they they say oh god I want you to bless and sanctify the food for the nourishment of the body and feed the soul with the bread of life yeah they don't trust God not by 80 means not about to bless food no sir they're going to do they're going to listen to the devil the devil say both say this about this food say that about that food say that about something else a man and Jesus had taken over thought while you shall eat or drink hey man I thought myself though that generation didn't believe it but generations are not going to believe it either amen Oh we'll always say that generation they didn't believe in eating this there was a contrary to their faith kind of a religion that's right Jesus trains at all my brothers same they in this day and this hour a man the devil is telling else it is something else says tell him that a man and if I get all these Booton free food and all that stuff that's a bunch of nonsense amen as I told you before a certain magazine did did did an article on it hey man and they said you know what we've studied it and studied and years ago those that ate the most lutein lived the longest and they said what yeah they said those that ate the most gluten you know some years ago if they live longer than anyone else that refused to eat it hey man say what is it it is the devil and the prophet of God talked about a germ warfare coming and it's the enemy that's bringing that germ warfare a made by bringing the people into that law under that spirit of welfare and they're afraid of this and afraid of that and afraid of that where he is faith in God anyway where is faith trusting Jesus no matter what it is or we want God to bless us we want God to prosperous we want God to give us this and give us that but we're trusting God where were these simple things in life for everyday living a night in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your steps amen the fifth step of the righteous are holder of the Lord amen so anything that good alternatives a new birth takes away from us it is fear any man hallelujah because we like the noble man got fear man for further they're so afraid ahead name wants to do this want to do that he's going to figure everything out oh I'm going to do this for my safety I'm going to do this you know because they oh yeah this is better for me there's believe it with God any man and it literally literally let's get into the word let's follow what God says in the Word of God a menace let's live by the grace of God basics simple humble lives a man by the grace of Almighty God amen oh no no that's not this generation they don't want a basic symbol in a home away no no no they they they they they they want attention they they want this attention that eternal alternative the greatest attention they got is the devil's oh yes siree you're Satan recognizers their fear and brave you got a fierce eight recognizers out here because fears of the devil big love casts out fear and what works for the law of God is love and I said it is God is perfect love and without without God whether we don't have a perfect love but with God we got where we go and pray amen and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine love amen and what does it do praise the Lord it cast out fear praise the Lord oh you know yeah that's the first thing knowing guy comes in he takes over fear already the Lord I'm not lost anymore I'm saved oh well I don't have to worry about anything you know more and although I just like knowledge him and and he's going to look after me praise the Lord he takes away fear praise the Lord brother the scripture is there the instruction is there not to fear there's not to fear that don't fear that amen by conroy I'm gonna be with you I'm going to look after you I'm gonna I'm gonna give you give your life amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so there's very very very few that are born began there's very few that are that have got that baptism of the Holy Ghost because it is divine law amen exactly the battery of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine love because God is love and everything and the batch of the Holy Ghost is Christ in me the hope of glory amen is God in me as crazy shooting me and if crisis in your alternative this if there's any any attributes you got a brother it's divine law any man although did the I'm good no you better have love first then you have the goodness of God oh yeah have the goodness of God but you got to have divine that baptism of divine love and if you got a man it is my grace through faith divine law projects grace and grace projects faith and what is faith is God's leadership praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I wanted to bring that on our Sunday morning but I never never got to that scripture it is my great survey that we are saved where the grapes come from divine love presented grace and great projects faith and what is right is the leadership of God for your life it is the leadership of God for the day and the hour in which you live a man and boy if you really got the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I tell you there said that faith is going to control you that faith is going to guide you that faith is going to lead you that faith is going to be going to going to reveal to you what God the will of God for you in your day in your hour where he want you to go what he want you to do when he wants you to do with how he want you to live a man and he'll bless you amen and know it but you're you and you won't you won't get exalted you'll get more humble amen there are those old guard God's gonna do this guy bears this for me God be that for me and then they're going around you know with their heads up in there oh ha ha brave the Lord oh thank you lord whereas others are going with their head down say thank you lord I didn't deserve that any man but on the sinner saved by grace as I said I was going to try to get to a line about pictures to our brother Matthew and give them brought up on the screen here and say do you love the Lord like this person does do you love the Lord like that person did any man there's pictures there are individuals in their relationship with Jesus their opinion and their pains of this man and Jesus this woman and Jesus and so on old brothers I pray the grace of God although there and we had the leverage Jesus had John there John the Revelator aunt anyway because he was the one that the Bible says he was the one day when they sat at the table he would lay his head on Jesus breast amen Peter's admit when I tell you this that's why Jesus had to ask him Peter lovest thou me more than these they didn't love me more than these look did he love Jesus more than John London brother when John saw him again amen he saw many many when he when he when he came out of out of the tomb he saw a man he appeared twelve disciples when they were in there in that Upper Room any man John saw him then but I tell you there oh yeah they were praising God but then John saw him again in the book of Revelation and when John only know when Giants are coming down cold in a white roll the little brother and the glory of God all around them amen they talk about the pillar of fire and everything else were they that was there was that we with the Lord Jesus Christ I write on him heal him amen and what did John do he fell as one dead amen he fell as one dead before Jesus and yet baby they didn't do that when he came to them in the upper room and even very Thomas yeah yeah even when he said I won't believe he's risen from the dead until our underlie our I touched you know the the the in his hand and the scars in his hand but my fingers in his sorry and so on search when he wouldn't tell when Thomas was there Jesus came and says oh he said Airtel's look amen I tell you tom is gonna trying to he did it to bring out his full faith amen and he touched his fingers touched his hand rather then he touched touched his side and he believed but John believed he knew it was Jesus any man and just say you didn't opinion father's one bed but when Jesus came down to the reveal to John the book of Revelation the beginning and the Alpha and the Omega of the ministry to refer to the Jew journey to the Gentiles and to the Adventures of the Jews Rayong into the myth of millennial reign later on into a to eternity amen right on into eternity to say the Gentiles are sitting with him in this Rome by the grace of God amen and John fell as one dead and Jesus said rise again amen praise the Lord I pray in the name of brother sister I pray that where every way that the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ is bring us any do that that relationship that John had with him never Lord Jesus Christ brothers having the effect on us that it would have on John amen it was having any effect on the boy it's going to be humility Amen brothers going to Humble us humble John you only don't with some of the other disables by God amen but John but Peter realized that he never had what he it should have had at the time but he did habitat and when he was near the end amen and finally Peter acknowledged and manifested his humility that's right when he kept when he came to walk when he came to the end of his day and they were going to do to cheat Peter what they did to Jesus they're going to crucify Peter amazing all beloved all mine in the name of the Lord how they say recognize what God does how God is going to do treat you how I got what God is going to allow in your life amen and there's a reason behind it all John was the only disable that died of natural birth not a natural death he died yeah that's a that's the truth all the others were martyred and John he was Thomas and one was taken up to a high mountain and he was thrown off of course and he was killed by the time that he struck shrugged there down down below and they all they all died at their different race but John or Peter rather they their crucify Peter and Peter said listen I'm not worthy he felt he wasn't worthy he should to do it to be on the cross like Jesus why not worthy yeah like Jesus not that he wasn't worthy to be on the cross but wasn't worthy to be on the cross like Jesus and he said turned me upside down and when they crucified John they turned him upside down on the cross he had humbled himself absolutely any man it's a brother/sister in this hour in this age a man got off to Harvard ourselves in the light of what God has done in the light of what god is dead god ever to be humble and to be more sincere any man so that we saw that Jesus got more control Jesus got greater leadership in our lives amen not anymore praise the Lord as the revelation of the other review Word of God and the will of God for for Christ in course Amen God our posture we're going to we're going to yield to the will of God for Christ in our flesh amen while there's a little garden in the willow garden was with Lord not my village that he was going to be crucified he he was going to be whipped and brother you just think think about the spirit and the attitude Jesus had even Pilate felt that he didn't deserve to die no no it's his spirit and his attitude even put a dessert that in every way the spirit and the attitude of those scribes and Pharisees oh yeah he knew you know Jesus was different brother sister I pray I grace in the name of the Lord their God industries that you're different did you got a different spirit attitude not doctrine by a different life a man a different spirit every attitude he mean that Jesus had not my will father dying be done no matter what it comes up no matter what the circumstance no matter what the situation no matter whether you're challenged with not my will father dine be done and yet most are living to do their will I'm going to do this I'm going to do that pray ask God Lord this is what you want me to do I don't care what it is doesn't make it every what it is where there where there's a our sisters in there over or in the sky here in a school in a university or if you're at work Lord what is your will sometimes we base our decisions on on of circumstances you know that we're dealing with this circumstance to circumstance or or this manner that spirit all the way we feel that or this is not the will of the Lord well we better get down on your knees and ask God Lord what is your will what do you want me to do amen not my real father dying be done amen amen amen amen and so we would we say that if we knew what lay ahead of us Jesus knew what lay ahead of him yeah he knew what lay ahead of him that's why he was sweaty as there were great drops of blood do you sweat do you sweat just normal is the pressure just on you concerning the hour we're living in out brothers sister oh well Jesus do cuts the herb I know there's preacher a lot of preachers field preach that you you know you you're gonna have joy you're going to laugh and this and that something else you're gonna have joy in your heart you're gonna have joy in your soul but what you're going to go through on the outside it's gonna be it's gonna be hard and God is going to bring out what spirits in you bring out the leadership that's in you is it God or is it the devil old brothers sister it's Satan controlling control it's either Satan or the devil controlling the people amen oh no they're not out there without without an anointing on them they're not out there without without a spirit controlling them no no and they see their God or is either Satan and sometimes God will permit Satan to do this and there's other times caller it all depends on who the person is that God will just only let the Satan go so far and no further he says so far sure they'll go and no further and so on so brother sister we need to listen this determine what leadership we are under by the grace of God any man well how do I will I will I know what leadership I'm under by by your attitude and and your spirit but what you do and as I said what you do when you do it where you do it now you do it is that God's we for your life or is it something you just said you made the decision not it's something you wanted because we figure this out we figure that out oh yeah yeah yeah that's good that's good that's good that well I'll deal with that later yeah yeah yeah I'll deal with that well that's good that's good yeah what's God's will Amy if Jesus was looking at looking at the minute what was going to happen it was all it'd be all negative all negative because he was gone he was going to be oh my lord grace God in control any man even just before gets M&E what what did Jesus told I said why did Jesus tell the disciples to go get a sword why would they want a sword and they came and they had all they had was two shorts and Jesus said that's enough yeah I was surprised and I said oh oh now I know the the use of one of those swords would vindicate that he was the Alpha and the Omega the end of the many was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God he was the spoken word made flesh hey man well why the sword well when they came and they arrested Jesus that's when Peter came with the sword and chopped off this the servants hair ear yeah chopped his ear off what did Jesus do oh here they are didn't want to take Jesus and and they're gonna whip him they're gonna punish him and everything else and eventually crucify you and Jesus just he said put up your sword he that either the own lives by the sword will die by the sword and he reached down just think Jesus reached it oh my praise the Lord and after all he went reading that's heavy he was there to heal and he reached down and got the servants here and he put it back on again as if he's as if Peter never cut it off I said Oh Lord that's why he told the disciples to get a sword I said I don't think the disciples knew that but jesus knew a man just thinking he knew it and they eats it all right they took him they arrested him yes right brother I pray God that will we honestly regardless of what's in what's in store for you tomorrow tonight next day or next week next year Lord not my will be done your will hey man Lord I get up in the morning Lord not my will your will praise the name of the Lord hallelujah over the island who I feel like speaking in tongues but not too many would like that oh yeah someone there I just wanted this was on my mind too last couple of days maybe before to say it tonight someone come to brother branham and said oh brother Brown I was in a median and I heard these people there was talking they said they were talking in tongues and he said like this and he was imitating it and but he not now he had a right spirit and he said brother Brown was that God was that God and he said brother I'm still not able to judge God amen brother round would respect it as God a man not like that that that preacher that sit next to me in that restaurant any and he was time with tongues but he was negative negative he didn't believe in Tommy in tongues message preacher and and he and he started to imitate it and I never told you this before what he said would word he used he said always said it it's just Toyota Toyota Toyota and he said that he said and they believe his tongs and he said he said God don't use that no more that's gone no it's not if that's gone justification is gone if that's gone sanctification is gone the baptism of the Holy Ghost is gone no no so brother when the bachelors the Holy Ghost because I used to you're still justified by faith I'm still sanctified by faith a man I still got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet of God said you have access to the gifts he said they're only there on the shelf now he said we know that Pentecost went went beyond the the baptism and they put too much emphasis on on the gifts and especially speaking in tongues and so on so but he said there there on the shelf the gifts are on the shelf he said if you need them they're there use them amen and he did someone Masson and well well well believers speaking tongues yes he said and I know there's not many here this spoke in tongues but again the revealed word itself is the tongue that's right not many understand what we're saying when it comes to the revealed word any man old brother he's speaking in tongues amen oh yes I can speak in the gift of the gift of tongues and I've done that and and interpreted as well yeah yeah at one time a brother getting our DVDs and he said oh brother German he said I'm glad to hear that he said you spoke in tongues then you interpret it I said I did oh yes he said you did and he said I went and I told this other person he said yes listen oh I said good eisah praise the Lord and I don't doubt it God God God is still God a man he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he can use any gift that he wants and brother this gifts dear that we need in everyday living that's the truth we need them to go and check the gift of the Spirit and see what gifts do you have access to any man brothers not just saying oh I believe the message I believe Malachi for I I believed in women through the garden I hear what he said of a serpent seed and Shawn and water baptism yeah that's fine that's good but let's make it let's go deeper to your personal life and your your personal relationship with God what gifts of the Spirit do you do you have this gift do you have that gift there's gifts there that you need every day now you don't have speaking tongues every day but there's gifts here that you need no matter what you're doing no matter where you go you need those gifts there's gifts of discernment and you need no matter even if you're a thief it's in a school especially in this day especially in this age you need brother do you have that gift of discernment that the anointing of the Holy Ghost in you oh yeah you want to discern this spirit at your job this spirit in your school this spirit you know whether it's in your home or whatever what's that's the truth I pray God give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and making you a new creature in Christ and if you're a new creature in Christ you're you got access to gifts amen you got an anointing that the rest don't have out there you know what they don't know and you're seeing what they don't say and you're living like they don't live hey man not just good but righteous amen and it's not just not just when I say righteous it's the righteousness of God in you amen it's the Word of God in you the revealed word amen because we are the sons and daughters of God we are led by the Spirit of God and not why why we live by the Spirit of God now remember not outside but you live from the inside God's Holy Ghost leadership is out of your heart not your head no no it's on the inside of the insight by the grace of God so brother let's make sure we have his leadership in our lives amen right let me get back to the scriptures in Exodus 13 and verse 20 and they took their journey from Sukkoth and encamped and eat them in the edge of the wilderness and the Lord went before them by day and a pillar of a cloud to need them the way amen Israel needed leadership oh yeah there they had a prophet they had Moses there Joshua dad Caleb but they needed God amen and it says the Lord went before them by day in the pillar of a cloud and to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of the fire by night from before the people amen God leads by the pillar of fire and the cloud and brother what's under the pillar fire in the cloud it's the revealed word a man it's the will of God brother what was Moses doing when he went down to bring Israel out of Egypt it was God fulfilling his word it was he had already prophesied four hundred years before this is amazing 400 years before God told Abram your seed is going to be in a strange land for four hundred years but he said I'm going to bring them out amazing and God sent the prophet Moses down to bring them out turn with me to numbers 27 numbers 27 and verse 15 and Moses spake unto the Lord saying let the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh said a man over the congregation yea said a man over the congregation which may go out before them which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd brother as believers we are not to be sheep without a shepherd no no ever since ever since the the baptism of the Holy Ghost God has had shepherds to lead the Sheep amen the fivefold ministry oh and the world can you do away with the vital ministry you know and like like those believers that are just listening to tapes of brother Branham and I know that there's a certain group of believers that are presently listening to the the revelation of the seven seals and they're listening to the tapes well I said Lord what are they going to do and what it's going to be their actions and reaction when they get to the questions and answers on the seven seals are they going to skip the questions and answers and just jump from the sixth seal to the seventh or will they listen to their questions and answers I said their faith is going to be challenged why because during the questions than answers there is a question brother Branham does the bride have a ministry and he said yes and he says she's at it he said since the day of Pentecost he says since the beginning of the churches and he said it's the five full ministry he said it's right there in the Bible and he listed them and yet we have a generation that is denying the fight for ministry the listen Saints the problem of God also are highlighted the fact that if we're going to be leaders here should you'll be a leader there in glory yes like I said Evan is not a dream world Evan is going to be a it's going to be a real heaven and a real earth yeah and we're and where there's gonna be a real city there's gonna be real things to do outside the city now I know there's not gonna be any any oceans but they're known without a doubt there's gonna be rivers yeah so brother sister okay how can we deny the leadership of the ministry that God has ordained and you go there any again and and and you notice why God has ordained these that lay that fivefold ministry and brother if without the five or ministry then it's not going to be accomplished it is for the perfecting of the Saints so brother if God was going to do that then brother and he started back there and he's going to continue that right on through to the end and when we get into glory the ministry is still going to have a position probably God said he said now he said I could be called to preach and he said Henery and not do it if I could sit in the congregation like you now he said if I'm elected and predestinated according to the Word of God he said I won't lose my salvation but he said I will lose my reward that's right brother sister this being the will of God under the leadership of God so you're not going to lose your reward and some are going to lose their salvation some are going to lose the reward of eternal life some are going to lose their that reward of going from here to eternity yeah but he said as a minister he said I won't lose to the reward I want no I won't lose my salvation he said but I will lose my my reward what will happen he'd end up outside the city not in the city grace brother god help us let the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh said a man over the congregation which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd a man again a confirmation of leader of God's leadership is not just the man it's God in the man God revealing his will to the man and the man is going to lead lead them according to the will of God in Deuteronomy chapter 8 I'll have to bring him to conclusion with these scriptures because there's three or four other scriptures after these but we will leave them until Sunday amen in Deuteronomy chapter 8 in verse one all the commandments which I command thee this day shall he observe to do that he may live amen live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's for them it was the natural land for us it's the spiritual his eternity is the kingdom of God and it says verse 2 and thou shall remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness a man why he said to Humble thee and God is allowing things to happen in our lives to Humble us yeah god help us and again as ice you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have the evidence of divine love you'll have humility absolute humidity and to prove thee God did it to Humble them and to prove them and to know what was in thine heart whether thy words keep his Commandments or know a man God proved them that's right and God proves you God is proving me God allows this to happen that to happen what for to see if you love him to the extent you you're going to keep his word not not legally a legalist but spiritually based on love there are many that are legalists eating around the message although just urges go no but they dote air-quote their or a verse here verse there but it's not coming out of their hearts it's coming out of their heads no god help us that it's going to be spiritual revelation out of the heart so verse three said he humbly and suffer thee to hunger and fed them with manna which thou knewest not and neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord does men live a man thy raiment wax not all upon thee nearly they foots well these 40 years thou shall also consider in thine heart that as a man chase it chasin rather and corrects his son so the LORD thy God chase nathie and he does therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways and to fear him and a theorem is to respect him have absolute respect for brother sister because God allows things to happen to bring it what's in your heart a man that those who are going to go all the way or those who are going to refuse to go all the way with God according to look to go the with what God wants you to do by all I want God to do it God want you to do it listen all the signs and the wonders that God did to bring Israel out of Egypt now consider what he did in Egypt consider what he did bringing them out of Egypt and brother then they refused to have the faith to go in and possess the promised land surely if God did what he did in the age of and God did what he did in the Warner's surely God was able to do what he they needed to be done in the promised land Joshua and Caleb they didn't doubt they said if God be for us who can be against us and and Caleb was an old man that's right he was an old man but about you young people you've got before us who can be against us you believe that God is able to take us him oh well God's through William Branham brought us out with all the signs and the wonders that were done there many many an old person today don't even understand the Ministry of Woodham BAM they can't think they can't reconcile it that was on the internet they said how can we reconcile the signs and the wonders that wouldn't random did with the message that he preached you know they recognized what was it they're in well he the ministry that he had was like the ministry Jesus had and that word that was Jesus it wasn't with a man who was Christ using William Branham discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and he was discerning the past the present the future of that person that's right praise the Lord amazing absolutely amazing brother caught Elvis to be sincere by others to believe God help us to have faith Isaiah chapter 3 a man I in Chapter three and oh there was one verse there well with five verse 10 it says say each of the righteous that it will be well with that with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doings and so will we what'd you do you're gonna have to eat it you're going to have to bear with it it says they shall eat the fruit of their doings but we said woe unto the wicked it should be held with them for the reward of his hands shall be given him as for my people children are their oppressors and women will over them the prophecy this is a woman's world and he said and women rule over them they said all my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths so there are true leaders honor the anointing of the Holy Ghost and there are false leaders under the anointing of the devil that's right when you hear a ministry make sure he's on that he's under the anointing of God not the devil oh yeah such as such was the deception in the first church age such was the deception down through the ages and in the last age in fact in the last age a Satan took the church over and Satan got total control of the churches and unfortunately Satan got controls some message churches yeah and that's why that the Antichrist is going to rule over the earth and it's going to be religious you know and like I said you wanted to go and join them and be called this and they call that nobody couldn't you can go along with them and say yeah I go along I agree with you I agree with you and many many are going to agree with with the Pope are going to agree with Rome then you're going to agree with with denomination business so oh yeah they'll agree with it you know yeah I agree we need that we need this we need that now and they'll sell their souls now brother it's gonna be so deceiving and he's gonna eat going to control everything god help us sure brother that says my people they which lead thee cause thee to err to go in the wrong path just another couple of scriptures let's go to Matthew chapter 15 so this makes sure we're under the correct leadership controlled by God not the devil in Matthew chapter 15 and beginning to read at verse 10 and it says he all the multitude have said unto them hear and understand a lot people who are hearing it but they're not understanding it the Bible says get wisdom but get understanding a lot of people come you have wisdom and they know the word and they can quote the word and they can say this and say that but they're lacking understanding of the will of God for these circumstances or that issue or their another issue oh yeah you gotta have understanding that's right so you what you what you do you're doing the spirit led by the spirit so you're not going to do it in the flesh and led by your flesh god help us oh yeah there are people that just read the word the letter of the word and can handle condemn everybody except themselves by God will condemn them that's right brother I'll tend to this if you if you experienced the grace of God you'll reflect it by showing grace to others most definitely oh yeah brother again if we love God we'll love others by the grace of God oh my but it's so little of that today Peter were there to condemn and criticize yeah but what about what about lying yourself up with the word judge yourself first there's too many looking into it again like I said such a Sunday too many are looking into the to them well we say the mirror the Bible says the glass of the Word of God and then they see themselves but then they walk away and forget what they saw a lot of he was sitting under the hearing of the word and they see themselves but then they'll walk out to forget what they saw forget what they heard yeah how many in the hearing of my voice are playing of the word to themselves yeah I tell you if anything the word will do the revelation in our hearts it humbly Lord please your grace and if you no matter what you saw you say there goes me but for the grace of God the prophet of God said if you see if you see a brother or sister he said at fault or in a mistake or something he said pray graced pray for them the grace of God for them god help us brother remember the same job in wherewith you judge others God judge you that's the truth oh yeah god be with us in verse 10 he said he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand now that was good into the mouth their part of the man but that was cometh out of the mouth this default of the man and then came his disciples and said unto Him knowest though that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this same but he answered and said every plant which my Evony father had not planted shall be rooted up I trust were the plants that he planted let them alone he said they be blind the leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch amen make sure you're under the ministry that has clear eyes to see the reveal word to understand the revealed word not just to know it intellectually or the mechanics of it but to have the mechanics and the dynamics of it exactly the one thing to have the mechanics but you need the dynamics to know what to do when to do and how to do it don't go by the letter of the word you got to go by the spirit of the word a man praise the Lord all right let's go to one more scripture here and that's in Romans book of Romans chapter eight Romans chapter eight I haven't got to the notes that I wrote for tonight and we'll get to him Sunday nor Willy in Romans chapter 8 in verse 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh you shall die a man many are living after the flesh what the flesh wants and what's important to the flesh but there's got to be the soul what's important to the soul and you lead the rest with God just do what you got to do and leave it all with God if you live after the flesh you shall die but it eats through the spirit to mortify the deeds of the body you shall live kill the deeds of the body amen so that you're not governed by the senses of your body you're governed by faith for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God so are you led by the Spirit of God are you led by the Holy Ghost in what do you think say do act react are you led by the Spirit the proof the evidence that is not me that lives is Christ that liveth in me not many but there's there are a few who are led by the spirit and they walk by the spirit they talk by the spirit they keep their minds and attitudes and spirits right for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for he had not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God amen god bless his word praying that we are led by the spirit the evidence the token that we are the sons of God that we are the and that you are the daughters of God and brother to remind to leave these thoughts with you again I did quote it on Sunday considering the hour in which we lived this is a serious subject concerning the last days the believers are warned that false leaders and false leadership would prevail to the extent it would deceive the very elect if possible now brother that otic put us on our guard deceive the very elect if possible if possible thank God is not possible I know there was a preacher that did that preached Oh y'all you can be a you're going to you could be the very like men be deceived Noah says if possible amen so we deceive the very elect if possible such deceit causes man to serve God contrary to the correct will of God what is the correct will of God let's make sure we're in the in the will of God doing the will of God think the will of God act the will of God living out the will of God not what you think what God thinks Amen most we have to make sure that the leader you are following is under the true anointing of the holy girls keeping us in line with the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth to give us the faith that is pleasing to God for it is by faith that God leads us the revelation of his will and his word for the hour in which we live amen I gave you the scripture said the Lord was the laid on my heart to share with you concerning God's leadership and how God leads and why God leads us they meant we need leadership amen without it will not make it we need the leadership of God the weight the way that God has ordained it and predestinated it that God has set in the church a fivefold ministry to lead the people but let's make sure we're that the ministry that were under is under the right anointing and and also as the pastor the prophet rather is already ministered on choosing a bride and he compared it to choosing a church they were choosing a bride to the church and he said so you don't want that person to person you choose they want their spirit to get on you a man and he says like it's like going to a church he said go to certain churches he said and to spirit the pastor he is all over the congregation no no we don't want to spare the pastor to have control and that's the truth there's a lot of churches and the spirit of the ministry controls the people they do their worshiping the ministry becomes a God yeah but knowing you got it it's the Holy Ghost got to control you amen and it's God's with the Holy Ghost through the ministry preaching and ministering to the people amen - up with the word amen by the grace of God amen so that we're going to get the faith that pleases God just a quote err this is leadership but it is not the same message that he preached in California this was this message with December the 765 and this message right here was October the 31st 65 and not only just a message on leadership but he was preaching it to young young brothers and sisters it was a youth meeting and he preached leadership and he was encouraging the young people to make sure that they come under God's leadership he says you're going to be under my mom's leadership for a while you'll be under dad's leadership you'll be under the ministry's leadership you'll be under this leadership but he said make sure he said that God's in control amen you're going to answer to God it's not answering to mom not answering the day and not answering to to the past or the shepherd it's answering to God amen it is the word your good answer to the Lord and so he preached this in October the 31st and in Arizona let me just give you one quote he said now sometimes other leadership's get so much influence on us till we don't know what to do when the time comes to accept Christ as our Savior amen now so what a fatal thing it is to reject the leadership to eternal life because that's life that can never end so we got to make sure that we have the correct leadership aim and our young people need to make sure they got the correct leadership that's gonna lead them to eternal life amen lead him to heaven not to hell Amen that's the truth because unfortunately many are going to end up in Hell thinking they're going to heaven the grace of God to us brother it's like I said before concerning those that those that cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of him that sits on the throne why because it finally dawned on them they were right and they were wrong and he was right and his bride was remember remember the bride sits with him in this role he man and so their direct Knology he was right but they're not repentant if they didn't repent when they were here they're not gonna repaint they're so their spirit and her attitude is gonna be wrong there as it was there a man they says hide us from the from him that sits on the throne the face of him god help us brother that we're going to humble ourselves to him and be and come under his control and beyond her his leadership morning noon and night the brother whatever we do we didn't make the decision God made the decision that's why I've tried to encourage it and I'm not doing it to boast brother journals anything like that not not by any means I'm standing by the grace of God that's right but no matter what I did as I said told you before I accepted it as the will of God I didn't look for this kind of a job that kind of a job that kind of a job no ice lord what's your will I said what did you want me to do where's you want me to go didn't matter to me absolutely that's why I like I said ended up working in Gander ended up working here in st. John's working in Labrador in Goose Bay for the American military and the Canadian military and our yeah forces and so on and then working for pharmacies and so on and I said Lord US or whatever you want me to do and he would bring me in contact with the right individuals Oh a lot of things have happened why because I was letting God lead not me Lord but yet thank God a sinner saved by grace amen but still the Lord was using me same with you you think God's going to use you because me you might be a good person no no no God goes out and you'll find maybe the worst out there before because they're gonna be humble to realize what it means to be a sinner saved by grace amen see again like the prophet of God departed brothers where the brook nor told not to condemn this one not to condemn that one he said because there was you but for the grace of God and just you remember that time he had the vision in that restaurant I believe it was and that woman was there and with him it with another man and I think she had her hair dyed and she had this she had that and and he was condemning her in his mind in his mind and the angel said he said go over there stand by the door and he went over stood by the door and he looked up and he saw Jesus and he saw himself and he saw himself do something that he'd never written who have never remembered he never thought about it and it went off and Jesus caught it and he said see he said that's used and he said would condemn you see if it went up to God now he said he's now he's you want to give him her and he said the same grace for you is the same brace for her so he repented what yeah the Prophet repented and he went and he sat down talked with her but his spirit was different and his attitude was different oh yeah he was humbled God humbled him and brother/sister the hour is coming oh yeah don't it the only ones going into rapture are those that are humble the humble those that humble themselves will be exalted by the grace of God a humble spirit a humble attitude amen you pray for this one you pray for that one you pray for somebody else a man that's right so the prophet of God would condemn sometimes sin and what this woman did or what this person did it that person was doing but he prayed for them he said yeah cuz there was one of Brennan but for the grace of God amen so god help us is my prayer to be more sincere more humble and more loving amen and that we love one another I'll put it this way as we love God just say do you love one another as much as you love God as tremendous if you do you will lay your life down for that person for that brother for that sister as he laid his life down for us we lay our lifes down for him for his body grace of God god bless you let's Dan amen they're saying see I
