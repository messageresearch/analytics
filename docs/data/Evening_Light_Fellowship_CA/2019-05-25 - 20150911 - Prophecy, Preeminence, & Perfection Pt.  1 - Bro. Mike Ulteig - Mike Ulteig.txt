week though Jarrell sent it on to me and it had to do with Isis in Iraq they had attacked a small town in northern Iraq and they went from house to house trying to get the children to renounce Christ this was there was missionaries there in in that town and they had been I guess that the families have been converted to Christianity and Isis was after the children to to renounce Christ and the children refused the faith had been instilled in them they refused and each child was killed out from house to house in front of parents so the missionaries had requested prayer for them because they everybody else kind of had left but the missionary said we want to stay and help the families so there's great fear for their lives so prayer was requested for those missionaries that are operating over in that kind of those kind of conditions and we think we have problems you know it really really pales compared to that when you're faced with when you're faced with death for what you believe so

beautiful special to proceed the word a man trusting that where we've come in the spirit in the revelation of what they say Amen and looking for him that redeemed us on Calvary looking for him to come and counsel us looking for him to come and give us understanding and wisdom and leadership through his word this faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and it's going to it's it's the written word yes but it's also the preached word a man for God has said in the church you know the ministry and then therefore the perfecting of the saints and it's not it's not the ministry themselves it's the word that God has given them to minister it's the word that God has given from Genesis to Revelation by the grace of God a man so that what for again for the perfecting of the saints this is just to bring us from from the children as it were all enough two teenage years on into the mature years onto the sons and daughters of God amen bringing us on up to - as sinners this sinner saved by grace resurrected healed now we're looking for this rapture and change of the body amen you know the spiritual Redemption now we're looking for the physical Redemption of this old body Damien and we know of course that if you're born again and you got the revelation of the word you you're really hungry - thirsting for the redemption of the body amen by the grace of God you know it's wonderful to have our brother Michael to here again he was a blessing a blessing in the Ministry of the word the last time he was here and we believe that God's go to bless us again but brother let's let's let's look beyond our brother Mike and let's look for Jesus amen look for Jesus amen because of who would you rather see come to this pulpit tonight it is Lord Jesus Christ Luise rather me tonight the Lord Jesus Christ amen it was you rather here tonight the Lord Jesus Christ amen him is servants and I trust that we come in the spirit we come in the spirit yesterday that's what we're going to see and that's who we're going to see that's who we're going to hear a man that's who we're going to identify with his Christ a man he's real to me living brain reality he's real to me my father God is real to me of course is the sing years ago he meant by the grace of God by because we've been born again that's why he's real to me we've been born again and that's why the work we feed on the word a man as why we we drink the word man whatever form that the Lord gives it we're going to receive it by the grace of God so the Lord bless you let's be in prayer for our brother Mike as he comes the minutes of the word tonight god bless you god bless the revelation in his art as it comes forth by the grace of God amen and again I believe in llegar our brother Lonnie jenkins said and and maybe to me personally and might have been on annotate somewhere but he said you know when he would go to church and because he was an evangelist and a navy or a teacher rather of the word and he would going to this a certain church and he had a certain pastor and then he had a question he said i go i go in the spirit and he said an IV praying down lord I pray that you lay it on the brother's heart to answer the question that I have on my heart a man nor that Heath and yet you're huge with the minister for this for the pastor is going to answer my questions and it's going to dissolve maybe your doubts a man but you had to come in the spirit you got to come recognizing your need and believing that God is able to meet the need a man and brother and brother Lonnie Jenkins said he said brother he said God never failed me once he said every time he said that he said that I went with a question he said God never failed to lay it on the pastor's heart and he said he answered the question though he said he didn't know he said that I was looking for the answer amen so God will do that tonight so our brother Mike as he comes as a minister of the word Eli answer your questions if there's all of your doubts and if your spirit is right you need greatly increase your faith a man he Lily he'll heal your body no matter what they want your problem is come on Little Billy that's Billy and again we as we have somebody ministered on it if you can't believe for healing are you going to believe for the rapture I'll deal with her brother Paul might have mentioned it in his message and then i quoting the prophet because why because the rapture is healing of the total total healing of the body is the total change of the body by the grace of Almighty God amen it is the absolute redemption of the body so have you been redeemed spiritually in your soul you have experienced redemption in your soul you're a new creature in Christ in your soul then you're calling for the new body like his glorified body so that God increase our faith because we're getting closer brake hitting closer so grace to us on this stand on this thing I only believe all things are possible only believe as our brother comes and God give him the Liberty let go and let God of his way Amen Lord bless you and the Lord bless our I would say our visitors but it's just our brothers and sisters from outside the city so god bless you and our sister Kimberly is still with us from the the United States I guess that's why we still got the warm weather amen so the Lord blessed our sister Kimberly and all the saints clad our brother makanda was able to make it just to make on to the family and I thought was the surprise to see her sister Columbo I thought she was in Montreal no so much easier Newfoundland as I was explaining it to our brother Mike she's not in Canada she's in Newfoundland god bless her and God bless the family a man and and of course we pray grace to sister Rebecca we got married there in May and as in China and I have sent emails to the individual certain individuals concerning the the attitude of the Chinese government toward churches and worship and Christianity and straights it changes from time to time and they bring in new laws new renewal new regulations to try and govern it so we pray the grace of God be with our sister Rebecca and her husband in China and all all the all the saints of God in China amen the Bride of Christ in China god bless him and I I assumed my brother Bob mentioned the requests we received from brother it was from our brother rocky and an urgent prayer request and most of us here know him as the teacher in the Adventist school from years ago and and we had experience with him for many years history senators and prayer requests for what country northern Iraq - concerning the the ISIS and the and the and the monitoring of believers there and for the missionaries in northern Iraq God's grace brother cuz again letting me warn you it's just it's just eating up and it's just a sign that the the Great Tribulation is is just around the corner and the rapture is at this compat the corner not around it so let's look up by the grace of God let's go home hey man let's sing it only believe only then II you've gotta believe it hey man let's sing all things are possible Oh Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] let's say Jesus is here jeez [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the ground [Music] [Music] [Music] man you all may be seated for a moment thank you amen you could see everybody again last year when I come we were strangers and now most of us were not strangers anymore so I just thank the Lord for the opportunity to come back and visit Newfoundland first and transatlantic flight first Morse code they got a dog that nobody else knows what do is it comes from here and I got a bird they'd never seen before it comes from here so I found out a lot about neutral in the last year you know it's the first and everything just about and first foot brother branham on the internet you know and of course this nation didn't do that with a Newfoundlander did do that so that represents you amen and so we're all different tongues and Kindred's and Nations but we've been called up by one blood and just thank the Lord for that just you know appreciate little mark and his wife and I think they're both mercy gifts you know I remember years ago there was a brother preached on gifts of the other Spirit in the church of course everybody come really ready to go and and he talked about prophetically gift administrative gift mercy gift and different kind of gifts you know and everybody was kind of let down and up and you know didn't know exactly what to do with it and so I was just watching brother and sister coffee dinner demeanor and they just or they just wait on you hand and foot and the text messages you know I probably got about not quite a thousand but I got a lot of text messages you know how you doing you have to close on tight eyed and you know and you drink your water this morning you have breakfast you got your ticket and he said you he was watching me you know and he was watching the plane watch me come over here and not get to Atlanta he said well I see you got there on time I said yeah I did he said I see you all make good timing and you got trial just just good yeah yeah how'd you know that you know let me know when you get to the gate and you know I thought yeah I've always said this about a pastor and a and an evangelist you can tell the difference you know like if we're all going to go have a picnic and somebody's going to lead you know don't ever put the Evangelist in the front you know because he never he never notices that the light changes or not he just goes right through there and he doesn't see who made it through the light and who didn't make it through the light he's just trying to get to the picnic area and he gets her and he looks Rises well where is everybody and then the pastor he's looking in the rearview mirror hey brother so young he made it he thought we better slow down let them catch up you know he's he's really looking over everybody and and that's kind of way brother coffee and sister coffee is they just kind of hover over you want soup well I don't know come on I have some soup I got two different kinds you want some cookies well you know I don't yeah come on have a cookie you know you want this you want that and they just hover over you and it's just special people here you know it's kind of like the bird and the dog and now it's people and even though we come from the human race it's a special people here in Newfoundland and and I was thinking about brother lush brother coffees this brother lush he'll probably come around 12 o'clock it's on meet you for lunch tomorrow okay sorry I got up this morning a little bit slow and I knew I was gonna be late getting up son Tex brother coffee and said well before twelve and then I looked I said oh goodness already got two texts from them this morning didn't realize he has texted before I got up and got my phone on he said they just come between 12:00 and 12:30 or 12:30 and 1:00 I said oh perfect you know text them back that's fine so I figure that you know a lot of times a ministry he'll come and he'll just pop up college that okay I'm here so I'm trying to get ready you know and brother uh she calls he says okay I'm fixing to leave be there about 15 to 1 I said okay he says now I got a I got a light sweater on I said oh must be a little chilly out this is you know okay so I got the instructions when to be down and how to dress and everything you know and I was thinking about that and I thought you know back in the old days when they used to duel you know they some guy you know he'd get an argument with somebody and fuss with him and he'd take his glove and slap I'm going across the face and that was challenged him to a duel when I said you know brother lush he countered reminds me he's so methodical and everything and and he'd probably say okay prepare to defend yourself and the reason why I person says that is because they're not afraid you know they're they're self-confident in their armor and inner weapons and I said you know if he ever faces the devil he's guys they prepared to defend yourself you know that's what David did he didn't try to side blind Goliath he didn't try to come in behind I mean instinct and he just come down he said I come to you in the name of the Lord and prepared to defend yourself and and so brother Lucky's is like that he's just solid as a rock you know he's hankered and and you like people like that and you want people answered but you don't want them dogmatic and I don't find he's dogmatic that means when you just you know when I say it there's a period behind it and that's it and that's denomination but Jesus he he he knew where he come from and he knew who he was and I find in this age there's a lot of insecurity and I looked that up one time to find out what insecurity had not what it is but how it reacts a person that's insecure usually they they project himself as a controller because they're insecure so they want to control takes all he was insecure he wasn't you know if he if he didn't know that God set him there and that he was call of God and that was his church he he wouldn't try to retain to that but because of insecurity he became a controller and and then fine you know sometimes with new Christians we we come into Christianity we come into the message and the first thing we think now when I go to work I'm a Christian now and I'm gonna show everybody at work I'm a Christian that's insecurity because we don't have to prove anything to anybody if you know who you are and where you come from then then that you're secure but when you try to prove something to somebody it's because you are insecure you're not only trying to prove to them but you're trying to convince yourself and so when Saint attacked Jesus he said well if you be the Son of Man do this he didn't have to do nothing because he knew who he was he wasn't insecure Saint was insecure you know Saint you wouldn't think he's insecure but he's a controller he controls with fear and intimidation why does he do that because he's insecure in his kingdom and so what we want to do is we want to be established in this present day truth now we see all these things taking place around this we in the heavens we got the blood moons and we got to the Sabbath's year and all these things that's going on you see Israel being rejected by them the United States president and and most of the Congress and and then we find that they're welcome them though the Pope you know and he's coming in and he's going to be speaking to a Catholic Congress you know we got more Catholics in our in our Congress and then we got anything is the first time we've never had a setting Protestant on to some freedom court we got Catholics but we don't have any Protestants this last year when there was a presidential race there was no Protestant in the race and brother brown said now you watch Kennedy he said he's going to come in he'd probably a good person but he said he's going to open a door and he said you watch her talking about the church now Catholic Church you watch a worm her way all the way in he'd learned her way into the Supreme Court until they have no regard for the Constitution because when they voted for gay rights they broke the Constitution by taking the state rights away from them and declaring that the federal government is going to tell them what to do that breaks the constitution brother Brown said when when Kennedy sent the troops down to Little Rock he broke the Constitution because he took away the right of that state to decide whether they want integration or not so we find at that principle that they broke that Constitution even the Chief Justice of our Supreme Court said this had nothing to do with the Constitution because all they can do is interpret the law they cannot enforce the law they cannot make laws they are not an active group they're lawyers that have been appointed by the President to define the law that's all that they can do but they actually passed a law and broke the Constitution by doing that so we're just right at the we're at the end time we see all these things around us and we're looking at now here comes this poll and now he's announced a year Libertines and we're looking at was it all in and people are looking for things to happen I tell you what I'm looking for because I know we're so close to the end time brother Brown said the rapture is a revelation and that doesn't mean a new thought we're not waiting for somebody to come with a surprise revelation how this message like hatching an egg I'm just some new creature coming out we're waiting for inspiration to strike the word that's in you and I to bring it into a reality he said we've accepted the great truths of this Bible but too many it's not real why because it hasn't been inspired so we've accepted the great things of this Bible it said when the bride recognizes who she is when she recognizes her position she'll be gone so there's not anybody here hasn't recognized our position but there's an inspiration that comes to that he said you got enough faith right here to create worlds but he said now there's a law to that if you're born again and you have the Holy Ghost you got enough power to go on the rapture you're going to power to speak a world you're going to power but but what is it we recognize who we are but we ain't got the power to get out of here yet why because there's a key to that and he said the key is the law faith he said whatever God leads your soul to believe that's how much faith that you can have so what are we waiting for we're not waiting for a new thought on the revelation we're waiting for the inspiration to strike that we just step across into that so as we're watching all these world events I'm watching the ministry because the Holy Spirit Christ has to release that inspiration through the ministry to bring us to this rapture in faith so I'm watching the trend it was God sent a prophet and what'd he say and but now there has to come an inspiration through the ministry because the ministry is to bring to the perfection to the maturity until we're not intimidated were no longer tossed to and fro but were secured we know where we come from we know who we are and we know where we're going and we under complete control and I'm looking for that to come through the ministry I'm watching the trend of what's being ministered and you can watch it through change since since I come in on the message you watch the change how the son of man really broke forth and then and then these things broke forth and these things broke forth so I'm not just looking for the Pope to come those things are fine and that's part of prophecy being fulfilled but I'm watching the revelation of inspiration that's coming to the bride and it's going to take away all insecurity and Saint not going to intimidate you not with cancer not with tuberculosis not with death he said old death would be crawling up like an old spiders that get behind me death see it'll have to be a inspiration that God releases to you and I in the time that we have neato so as we said last time and as I heard brother less then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and the word being the Word of God and it has to come through a ministry that's sent of God because that's what the scripture says but hearing is not faith but hearing comes by faith so hearing and in the inspiration on the hearing brings faith because everybody has heard the Word of God doesn't have faith and it could have come through an anointed servant could it come in the power of the Holy Ghost but without inspiration doesn't profit to anything so we want to be walking with God but the inspiration would come upon the word as it comes to you and on as you sit there meditating reading your Bible looking at amount and looking at the sea listening to the wind listening to a message and here come that inspiration rolling in and it's just like somebody turns on the light you struggle it things you struggle it things and you sit down there you read one little word and all of a sudden by the inspiration of Holy Ghost one word it just like a an avalanche it's like a flood just comes running all sudden all these thoughts just come easy oh yeah that makes sense yeah that that's how this fits together and that fits together the only he can do them and that's what we're waiting on a man let's stand the head if we will I want to turn to second Peter and I know this is dangerous because I know the Newfie Bible is a little bit different than mine the last time I was here y'all didn't have the scripture that we have in our English Bibles and the new few Bible I guess was translate a little bit different but this time I'm trying to stay within the rims of your of your Bible that you have here in Newfoundland so we don't kind of leave you behind so in 2nd Peter chapter 1 I guess you got chapter 1 right you got yours Joseph chapter 1 okay alright second Peter chapter 1 and we're going to read verses 15 through 21 that's why I got in my bottom ones I hope we're on the same page alright 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 15 moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God for he received from God the Father honor and glory when we were there came such a voice to him talking about their own Mount Transfiguration from him the excellency the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard and when we were with him and we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy we're on to you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not not not in all time by the will of man but by holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost may we just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we approach your word tonight we know that without you we can do nothing and anything that we do without you is nothing but you promises or whatever two or three would gather themselves together in your name that you would be in our mist so father our gathering this evening is around you not just your word but your presence so father may you manifest yourself to your children may you unveil yourself as you promised to do as many as love you and was obedient to your commandments then father may you come tonight may you inspire me may you inspire the congregation may we be caught up together in one mind one soul and one Accord may you also pour out your anointing and break any yoke that would Fedder us tonight that we might be totally freed and liberated in the spirit to receive from you as you would give to each child of yours this evening the hidden manna so father we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may be seated yet our desire is like I was saying it's not really to bring something new or something different that would just amaze you but to be established in this present day truth and that's what we want to be that's what the ministry is for is to bring us to that place that were established and true faith and that by the Word of God that you and I can stand now I'm looking at three words prophecy preeminence and perfection and so I just want to look at these three words maybe today and tomorrow and maybe Sunday and we we had this discussion in a ministers meeting here oh I think it was last Saturday and I was just so inspired by the things that that the Lord laid on my heart I was trying to go a different route but it just seemed like this the way that he wanted me to go so so we're going to try to follow the leading of the Spirit prophecy preeminence and perfection and to me that these that these three things work together on a body because I'm not looking at three separate things but I am looking at three separate things I look at the the Feast of Unleavened the Feast of Pentecost and the Feast of Tabernacles now there's seven feasts but when when God broke these feasts down he gathered him into three parts because we had the feast of Passover the Feast of Unleavened and the sheaf wave all together and God called it the Feast of Unleavened and and then we had the feast of Pentecost now you could just come and partake of the feast of Pentecost unless that you'd already ferpa taken of the feast of Passover and the sheaf wave and unleavened and you actually couldn't even protect that unless that you were in a covenant relationship you had to be circumcised you had to be in the seat of Abraham and then being a covenant relationship with him then you could participate or be part of that Feast of Unleavened and then that would carry you over to the feast of Pentecost and then that would bring you to the Feast of Tabernacles which was the Feast of Trumpets and the feast of or the Day of Atonement and then the feast or the Feast of Tabernacles so we find it it's one it's one continuous revelation and it makes a complete revelation it makes a complete cycle and so it is with with justification and sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost now it takes all three of those to bring a complete birth and you can't come to sanctification unless you first come to justification yet we find men many times that he's never been justified but he's trying to get sanctified but in God's economy you can't come to sanctification unless you first come to justification but in his economy you can come to justification and stop and never go no farther but if we continue in that birth then you come to sanctification and in sanctification brings you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm not son necessarily talking in state steps or our time but we're talking in an event in your life when you're born again it could come in an instant we find in Cornelius that while he sat there and listened to the word he was he was sealed with the Holy Spirit so that means he was justified he was sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost while he was listening to Peter so we know it can come in an instant it could come in through time and it's not for us to try to figure out where I'm at you know one person said well it was a minister and he said well you know I got justified and found out it wasn't sanctified about a year too later I got sanctified and then about a year after that I got the Holy Ghost and I thought well you know that's kind of creating a little problem because what's the evidence of sanctification and then if I get the evidence of sanctification that now I know I'm sanctified and you justified through faith there's nothing tangible you can put your hand on them - it's like the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said there's no outward sign well I live better okay you know the legalist he lives better the Buddhists you know he becomes a monk he lives better he he gives away all his worldly belongings and everything and he and he tries to find this peace and self-contentment you know their lives are transformed by Buddhism Islam is transformed into the Islamic faith and so then we can be transferred into the into the Christian behavior and not have the life of Christ in us so we run into a problem here or to me it's a problem because I say well how did you know you was justified because justification comes by faith in the Word of God and that along it hasn't stand on evidences it's the righteousness of God through faith are you going to put up so then how you gonna know you receive the word you believe the word and you're justified through faith the faith of Christ sanctification takes that air desire that evil nature out well I'm sanctified because I don't smoke anymore well it could be and it might not be what's the evidence of sanctification that that old desire that worldly nature he called it the love of the world he called it the first husband it's gone but then you got to have somebody else come back in you got to have headship and so the dad comes in the Holy Spirit comes in and what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost well that's receiving the word rage you believe running around was prophet yes I do I believe he was a prophet you believe his teaching on serpent seed yes I do the devil believes that you believe in one God yes I do I believe in God head the devil believes in one God and fears and trembles some people believe in hidden ain't got no fear in them at all you know and so then when you really come down to it it's kind of like you said about that man you know sometimes the new birth is so simple we we try to religiously approach it there was a man one time brother Brandon tells the story about that man and he was in his office and getting ready to go to work that are getting ready to go home I think he put on his coat and reached in there and there was a piece of paper in there I guess it was a little track he pulled it out he looked at it I said where will you spend eternity he kind of looked at that walked over and throws it in trash can and went to go out the door and he stopped he thought about that went back over there and he unfolded that you read it again you folded it putting the pocket and you know he went home started praying and got his Bible out we started reading his Bible and you know the story went to went to Billy Graham's meetings and Billy Graham said raise your hand come up here and I'll pray for you I don't raise his hand went up there and prayed for him I don't know I don't so he went to Oral Roberts meeting went there and I said I ever spoke are not old Robert so he went to a Methodist Church I guess it was and said well do you ever shouted well no I mean they're all take them up for the men's prayer room crammed through took him up and prayed me start shouting all over the place he got home they said I don't know so he went to Oral Roberts chant Mayton went up there and it said well I just don't know if I got the Holy Ghost money so he then spoke in tongues oh no I shouted and raised my hand and I never spoke in tongues he said ran through me praying through he started speaking in tongues and I met a man outside the tent he got talking to that and I can't remember all the details but he got talking to that man he says well you know there's a prophet in the land he can tell you he said oh yeah he said who's that he's that all well his name was William Branham he said you'd get an interview with him and and he'll tell you whether you got the Holy Ghost or not whether you saved so he got the interview and brother brown tells us and I assume that's a real case but he tells us said the man come in and told them all he says he says well sir he said you remember when you back went back and picked that piece of paper out of trashcan he said yes sir he said that's when they got it why it changed his life why are you sitting in church here tonight something changed in your life it changed in my life it's so simple that the wise look over we look for tangible things everything that God gives us is my faith and that's not blind trust it's a revelation though the rest of the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally so I was talking to a man young man years ago and his daddy was a preacher in the message and and this young boy he was quite he was quite I guess I'll use the word intelligent because he could really catch all the types and everything in the message and he just surpassed his daddy and understanding son of man and everything and he was talking to me he had a young white boy and he had an afro and he I think he smoked pot a little bit at the time and he was saying you know and so I caught his spirit you know but the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ and he was showing all this that he knew and everything and I said there were only one problem young man I said Peter had a divine revelation but he wasn't born again doubt to Christ the Son of the Living God Jesus said that's good now when you're converted he said then go streaking for your brother so brother Brown said what is the new birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally he said it's something that that takes place between you and him and only you and him knows that he said Christ is the center of the Bible and when you're born again then Christ is the center it's the Senate revelation of your whole life everything is based upon that and then he goes on to cite well they said well how do I know if I got a revelation he said it expresses itself through you not through your mouth through your life and he said and the life of Jesus Christ is the center of that revelation so you can have a revelation that's inspired by God or that you academically can catch a hold of but if the life of Christ is not down in that soul that heart then it's the life of Christ that is the center of that revelation because God is not calling you to a Christian life God is not demanding that you live a Christian life many times the church calls you to a Christian life stop cutting your hair ladies quit wearing pants new men quit running around wrong places and this that and that many times that Christianity from the church natural calls you to a Christian life that God is not calling you to a Christian life he's calling to the life that's within you he is quickening the seed that seen you and a Christian life comes out of that scene so the gospel by the Holy Spirit is calling to the life of the seed that lays in you take wheat and they place it up in the in the gardener's way back over into Egypt and in the tombs though they found kernels of wheat back there now that wheat that we you know it has a voice isn't I can't hear it but it has a voice it's calling for sunlight it's calling for water it's calling for ground because there's a life in there you say I can't hear it I love it there's a voice you take that they've taken that out of those those tunes and those Garner's that was saved back in the days of Joseph and things and they'd taken it and they put it in the earth and then the rain comes and the Sun shines you know what happens life starts to come forth so there was in you and me a seed we call it a soul and that soul was crying out for God it worshiped fire or shed totem poles it worshipped money and you know and it had a voice that soul had a voice and it was crying out for life now my spirit heard that voice and it interpreted it and it says oh you need a girlfriend you need money all you need to smoke because brother Branham said there was a thirst in you and me for God but we quenched it by worldly things so the problem was as my spirit didn't understand the language of my soul but it could catch the influence that it knew it was crying for something so in the misinterpretation of the voice of the soul it cried out for earthly things something to bring comfort something to bring something to bring peace something to bring a security in my life and so my spirit trying to understand the soul was trying to satisfy that desire but one day one day he stood in your way like he did the woman at the well he got right in front of you because he's the word he wasn't attract he wasn't somebody quoting scripture to you but he was the word himself bringing himself to you through a vessel into a written word but he came and he confronted you like he did the woman at the well and he could hear that boys crying and he was the water of life and he poured some water on there and you came to life and your desires changed now the things that you do why why do they why why do they grieve you because now there's something in there that's causing you to be grieved they didn't grieve you to listen rock and roll I remember my daddy used to get after me and and sometimes you know I just grit my teeth and he'd heat Whitney or not you know and then there was times my daddy talk to me just break my heart I can't remember what it was I remember one time he was talking to me and I felt so bad I said I thought within myself I'll never do that again month later and there I was doing it see but now of something on the inside of the inside if that changes if the center desire of you're trying being if that desire changes you it motivates your whole life and it transforms you and it brings out the Christian life a little by little little by little and what is the life of Christ as I was studying on that you know to be like Jesus and of course the Pentecostals they're thinking about all the Magnificent things he did raise them to it and healing the lepers and all the astounding things because that's the aspect of the life of Christ that was manifested in them and the and the Baptist they look at the faith the faith of Abraham and the faith that's the new birth that's it but each one looks at a aspect of the life of Christ but to me when I really looked down into the heart of Christ what was it that that made him what it was is that I come to do not my will but my father's will and when he came his humility powers and humility what is the bride coming to she's coming to true humility I'm talking about divine humility I'm not talking about human humility and what is divine humility for Christ that started in heaven before he ever came substance and it said that that he thought it not robbery to be equal with God now I've heard people say what that means that it was like when when God taken the spirit off of Moses and put it on the seven he said now he didn't have any less and there wasn't any less spirit when he put it on seventy but actually what that actually means is that he didn't feel that it was something to be grasped a hold of or to hang to or retain he was willing to release all what he was in heaven all the glory that he had and he emptied himself and he taken on the form of a servant not a king not a Patra Pope but he taken on the form of a rejected man came to zone and he was rejected and it said until the day that he came to the to the humility even to the death of the Cross so what was the death of the cross not my will but thy will so as the bride comes to that third pool she'll have to come to humility and what is humility when you surrender yourself oil for his will to have the preeminence in your life I'm not talking about legalistically I'm talking about in desire that we can say I've come to do my father's will not my will you'll always have a will because we're always going to be human but when we come to that total surrender of humility and I believe the only way that you can come to humility is to come to truth security to know where you come from and if I know where I come from I know where I'm going he never told those Pharisees you're going to hell I'll tell you where you're going you're going to hell now he says I know where you came from and because I know where you come from you're going back where you come from and there's been a place repaired for for that one that you come from and for you if we know where we come from that was the difference between Saul and David Saul was chosen by God he was called out of a little tribe he was humble old why I don't deserve this and right but there was something down in Saul that he was never changed in the inner man but he was rolled with with God's outward glory as the Pentecostals they had power without character and so then when he when he taken that throne after a while it was my throne my church I've been born again I've got my own Holy Ghost I can go to church when I feel like and I can do what I want - this is my life God as men me and Jesus we're gonna do this thing but you don't just don't match his Bible you know in my Bible when they got the Holy Ghost I found them in church they assembled themselves they went from house to house breaking bread and somebody stood up and one didn't preach to them now to get the Holy Ghost and they go to church when they feel like it and sometimes they just don't feel like it they got other things to do and Paul said as we see that day as we see that day from the heart I'm not talking about blood moons and all this I'm taught but as a heart looks and sees the day you begin to gather yourself the more off because now there's an urgency because we need revelation not a new thought not find some ministry over here across the sea that we got to go to and sit under what we need to do is sit at the feet of Jesus Christ and obedience not my will die will so we find it that people are trying to come to great things of what they think a third pole is it's kind of like a ministry brother around said the man says he can do it and thinks he can do it he can't do it but the man thinks that he can't do it he'll do it but then there he said there's an extreme if you just don't think anything of yourself and you can't do anything you sit down Waller and self-pity and never amount to nothing but to know I can't do anything without him but I am his child and he's called me and the more the more the more anchored you become the more security become the more peaceful you become the more quiet you become not always challenging and trying to prove but trying to help trying to take care of trying to feed trying to bring the lost and anybody don't here let them come that's what we're coming to and and you have to make that choice in your life and it has to be a free moral agency driven by the very love of God that sent us through the revelation of this hour now tonight I just speak a little bit on prophecy and I was looking I was looking on my phone today and and there was a there was an article on in the USA Today and it was it was talking about the Pope and I read this I read this part of it and it says because of what's on my mind of prophecy and it says that that prophecy what he says he says in verse 19 we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place so that's what I'm looking at tonight prophecy revealed he's like a light that's shining into a dark place we say modern events made clear by prophecy why because it's shining upon the events that's in the world and being interpreted it shows us what's taking place so we prepared for a for a young a power failure appearance will we always carry a flashlight up here and we we put it right here and and we're instructed if anything happens then the lights go out take the flashlight and turn it on so everybody can see how to get out of here so sure enough we're up here preaching the light and hit the transformer goes out normal acts I'd say all right church now everybody sit not it's not it's not be stampeding and everything now I'm fixing to turn this flashlight on but the batteries there's this thing been sitting up here for a couple years and we may not have much light so you do well to take heed that when I turn this light on look around see what the door is because this light is going to shine into a dark place but it's going to bring an illumination whereby you can see how to get out so you do all to take heed as unto a light that shines into darkness so that's what prophecy revealed is so I was reading this today and it says and it says for a century this is this is out of us us a news today for a century it was the paranoid political fantasy prophet Protestant fundamentalists and know nothing nativists the of Babylon they call him the Pope citing the book of Revelation would use catholic' immigrants to bend Washington to his the Pope's will and I thought man that's a mouthful he says paranoid political fantasy and I looked up that word paranoid account of what it meant but it means baseless or excessive suspicion of the motives of others and psychiatry means a mental disorder characterized by systemized delusions and the projection of personal conflicts which are ascribed to supposed hostility in other words are imagining always being attacked in these imaginary enemies and and I thought my goodness I said this man is calling these people that are quoting the scripture and calling the Pope and the Catholic Church the great of the book of Revelation and he says these people paranoid political fantasy and you look up that word fantasy and it means hallucination so he's saying these people that interpret this Bible which he probably don't think nothing about the Bible start with whoever's right in this article he said they're having hallucinations and they're saying this man is the great horror of the book of Revelation these paranoid stupid idiotic heretics that's what you are in this man's sight because that's what we believe and I thought my goodness and and I and I thought well you know that kind of reminds me a little bit that I was listening to a ministers but probably 20 30 years ago and he was in the in the deity doctrine and so he was getting ready to preach the congregation so first thing you want to do is disarm everybody so he says you know brother Branham dealt with the deity doctrine and and no spirits he said when when that mamba snake come out of that water and he shot it he said that took care of it and so what was he trying to do just trying to disarm everybody and get everybody relaxed because he was fixing to bring his deity doctrine so he is trying to prove to everybody that spirit doesn't exist anymore remember that snake didn't die it only went back in the water it's still here today so that's what Satan is trying to do through the news he's trying to disarm the people by what by by disillusioning them that prophecy is not prophecy that the Bible is not the Bible and that's that's why he's working so prophecy is like a light that shine us into a dark place and then I want to go to the book of Matthew and chapter 6 verse 21 and what does it say Matthew 6 verse 21 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so this has to do he said once your little spirit it can't rock and rolling all these things so there has to be a change a new birth of nature and now your treasures you know what treasures is that's the things that has the preeminence in your life when that man found that jewel of great value he went home he sold all that he had he sold all his treasures a lot of things that had the preeminence in his life it found something that was greater now that had this paramus that he was willing to sell everything to buy the field and to find this treasure so he says wherever your treasure is that's where your hearts going to be and then he goes on to say the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if I be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness that's kind of a paradox if the light that's in you be darkness how can light be darkness but that's what it says if the light that's in you if your eyes evil now in my Bible that says if your eyes single it's talking about healthy it's not talking about just one or just looking at one God if I heard it interpreted that way but when in my Bible says if your eye be healthy then your whole body is going to be full of light in other words you're going to be able to see everything around you it brings light to the body so if my heart if I'm born again then there's going to be light in my body but if I'm not born again then the revelation or the light that I have denominational ideas and traditions of man will only be darkness right so the light of the body the eye the body is light so the last anointing or the last dispensation of the four beasts was the eagle it was the prophetically age the a of the age of the eye because the Prophet was always the eye the voice of God and the last age was a not a sitting eagle but a flying eagle so we are now in the age it's a prophetic age and so you do well to take heed as unto a light that shines into darkness so this is going to be the age of light [Music] doctrine doesn't necessarily bring light but prophecy revealed not not prophecy talked but prophecy made flesh and talk to you what you're looking at is prophecy made flesh that's light and it's the light of the body what's the first thing they went after in Samson they took at his eyes who did it Delilah who that the world had revelation he had eyesight but what little it he had because he sold out he gave his heart to a woman and he gave his strength to God God don't need your strength he don't need your education he need he don't need your ability to be able to speak your charisma he doesn't need anything that you got while all he's finding is somebody that will surrender his self will and self choices to him that he might have a preeminence so they what they do they put the eye out and he couldn't see but prophecy revealed brings light so now what Satan trying to do trying to put out the eye you don't care about doctrine doctrine you know doctrine tells us how to walk but it can teach his original sin there's a lot of things in doctrine and doctrine is part of the gospel but saint is not worried about doctrine that's what brother Brennan even said he said I'd rather have the right spirit than the right doctrine you can have all your doctrine right the wrong spirit Paul's I know all the mysteries and not charity but prophecy prophecy revealed or prophecy vindicated it brings light as a John what's going on who are you what's this ministry what's it all about what'd he do he appealed a prophecy he wanted to bring light on his ministry the purpose of his ministry he said I am the voice crying in the wilderness what was that the light was coming down it was revealing what is ministry who he was in prophecy made flesh and vindicated prophecy I was studying in the in the in the and the Reformation let me read the scripture here so I can just kind of establish the scriptures I was going to go to Zach right but I'm not going to do it save time Zechariah 14:16 7:00 in the evening I'm at Shelby light Isaiah 60 darkness gross dark darkness over the earth gross darkness on the people horizons shine thy light has come so we're talking about light and we're talking about prophecy the Holy Ghost doesn't bring light but it said at the entrance of thy word it brings light now what word are we talking about the Living Word especially in this age is prophecy being fulfilled so over here and if you look at psalms 43 and look what David what he's appealing to and verse 2 for thou art God this is Psalms 43 and verse 2 for thou art God for thou art the god of my strength now in Psalms 42 and verse 8 he says god of my life so he kind of appeals not to different titles but what he's looking at oh god you're my life you're everything to me Paul said for me to live as Christ but now known this in chapter 43 of Psalms it says God in my strength my strength my power my virtue why does thou cast me off why do I go mourning because of the oppression of my enemy and if you if you read Psalms 43 you'll find out he said I went to church I went to the tabernacle I went to the temple and I went with all the believers and we worshiped we sang we offered up our praises and Thanksgiving he said but now when I walked away they were all rejoicing but why are there tears in my eyes why was the tears in David's eyes because he had known the presence of God and that's what David wanted to be in not the temple not in the presence of the priests and the believers and offering up sacrifices but it was God's presence that David longed for instead of him because when he was a young man he had an experience back there in the backside of the desert nobody was out there but just heaven from sheep and God delivered he felt the presence of know the reality of a Living God that's why he could go down there to Goliath why did he go down there to reveal unveil god to the people he said all in Israel and all the nations knew that there's a Living God now I believe they knew there was a living God soul consulted the prophets he consulted the tabernacle of Moses but it was empty he consulted the word but there was one thing that he never had an experience with and that was the ark he never had an experience with the presence of God as David did so when it came down to Goliath the latest in church age he he he had brought the people to follow man instead of gone he taught them about God but now he had been come a holy man and so when he looked out and he saw glides he looked out and he looked he said hey no way I can take him and the people they look and I said well he can't take him we can't take him but David wasn't looking at man he'd been in the presence of God and he didn't go out there to challenge anybody it was in humility our David had been jointed King he was king over his brothers he was king over his daddy he had been anointed in their presence with all God poured out through a prophet and anointed him King and he sent him right back out there taking care of the sheep you know what his next next job was busboy that's what we call people in the in the hotel he said David come here yes dad what do you want here take this lunch to your brothers your mama's fixed it always is their favorite cookies and their favorite sandwich and and and and find out how they're doing and giving her a report nothing about David David said well how do you think I am you know I'm gonna be king over Israel you treat me like this no he's okay daddy I'll do that didn't you Millard see God was placed them in the right place at the right time to do what he wanted him to do not what he wanted to do he was doing something he might not have particularly cared to do carry lunch to his brothers and he couldn't even go to war all right David how's my uniform look it looks alright see you later day don't forget take care of sheep you know they were going off the war he couldn't go he wanted to but he couldn't too young he got out there and he heard that Philistine he looked at the army he looked I said what is going on here why are you letting this uncircumcised philistine cursing the armies of God and the God that we serve he said all that Israel would know that we are in the presence of God he's a present help in the time of trouble he wasn't talking about theology he wasn't of my Bible history he was talking about the God presence it was right there and he went down to unveil God to the people and when they got back to church after that day I mean it was an inspiration to the whole army when they saw what David did under the power of God they went down in slate Philistines all day long they got rid of their TVs the women got rid of their pants quit cutting her hair men start dressing right getting a decent haircut you know they they kill those giant those from people all day long all those idols and when he got back to the church what David here he didn't hear what a mighty God we serve no said Saul has slayed a thousand and David ten thousand Oh Paul was a great man but brother branham had a greater ministry than what Paul had whoa what happened to Christ who was doing the work Paul or brother branham whose ministry was it Paul or brother branham when we begin to compare man with man whose ministry excels what ministry we've already left Christ out but they should have been saying what a mighty God we serve but God was never unveiled to them they only moved from one camp to another many people are coming to this message and never come out of denominations just because you change camps doesn't mean that you come out it's when God's been revealed to you now when I was looking at the Reformation I was reading in a book that I had bought it's a some lectures that was given in 1886 and I think it was called Romanism and Protestantism in the light of prophecy and what this man was showing I think it was in 1517 that Luther he goes out and he nails the 95 theses on the door and that's what we marked the Reformation but he said really it didn't start there to him because when he nailed that 95 theses on there it'd be no different I sent an email to him to brother lush and I said now brother lush I kind of look at these thunders a little bit different you do and here are some points that I'd like to make and and and your revelation of a serpent seed death I see that kind of different thing I'd like to debate these points with you now I'm not coming against his authority and I'm not challenging him as a minister nor is the Son of God I'm just saying I'd like to debate these issues with you and see if we can reconcile it with the word that's all apart that's all that Luther was doing he wanted to he wanted to discuss these 95 points that he had that looked like the Catholic doctrine was off and he'd been reading his Bible and now he had 95 what they call the 95 theses he was calling them to a ministerial me and so they brought him the worms and he not only had two ninety-five theses but now he had printed some pamphlets off of these revelations that he had had and they said we want you to repent he said I cannot I'm not subject to Pope's or councils but my soul is prison by the Word of God captivated if you can prove to me or show to me by the Word of God that I am guilty I'll repent and he would not repent so then the Pope he put out on what they call a a papal bull like a wanted poster guess what they used to do in the Old West but the Pope he put out a papal bull it was a excommunication and his life was open anybody wanted to kill him and so he went he got back he went to Wittenberg and he got that papal bull and then he got all the doctrine it uh they had a a word for that but it had to do with the letters that the Pope had sent out that became doctrine in the church it took all those letters he took that papal bull and he went into the middle he went into the middle of Wittenberg and there was a big bonfire and he threw those things in the fire that was when he came against the power and authority of the Pope and a holy roman catholic church that was when the Reformation truly set in now what gave him the power what gave him the strength to withstand the Pope and the authority of the Pope I found that that all the Reformers hust wiggly Calvin Tynan Dale like lifts all of these great reformers you know they had one common revelation that tied them all together now we know we had the Armenians we had two Calvinists and we had this and we had that but there was one there was one typos there was one scarlet thread that tied them together and that was the Book of Daniel and second Thessalonians and the book of John revelation that the Pope was the Anti Christ and the church was the great and when that light shined in the Luther's heart he was not intimidated he was not afraid he knew it wasn't the Holy Ghost he knew wasn't God's church he knows the Antichrist that's what gave him the bonus because the light shined in darkness and as I began to study further it wasn't just a new revelation but then you study about the wall deniz and the different there was three different peoples that was they were they were what we'd call the true church because Paul went to Rome and they had the letters of Paul in Rome and these walled in these had what they called to receive text they had the letters of these apostles and they knew that the Catholic Church was nothing but the Antichrist and the great and that came down into the Reformation and that became the strength of the Reformation David said old God of my strength send my light and I cruise what for then it might lead me tonight Tabernacles in other words send thy light and truth that I might find you your presence so in prophecy is revealed it brings us to the presence of God send thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them bring me not lead me only but bring me unto thy holy hill but Mount Moriah Mount Zion and to the right Tabernacles then will I go unto the altar of God unto God my excellent my exceeding joy yet upon a heart I will praise thee O God my god what that woman at the well say she said he said give me a drink I've even got nothing to draw he said well if you'd asked me I gave you a drink that you'd never thirst again now son was taking place in the natural and then there was a great Symphony that was going on and in this other dimension God was inspiring this young lady because when he said I'll give you a drink that you never thirst again inspiration struck and she said I don't like to have a drink she knew that was the answer she knew it was this fountain of life that Israel in forsaken she'd been to the churches she'd been to the denominations they taught her exactly right from the Bible they said he's coming he's coming this prophet that Moses spoke of we believe that he's it's just time for the rapture time for the coming of the Messiah we know it's close at hand by the signs around us she said when it and when he comes he'd be a prophet he be God and flesh she said I perceive you're a prophet where'd that come from do you think that comes from a natural understanding from her Bible catechisms by the ones that taught her that they rejected him they called him Beelzebub her Sunday School teachers her pastors and all I turn that seat was crying what was it crying for there was a voice in that seed crying for the presence and the reality of God the churches couldn't bring it to her so her spirit said what you really need is a husband you find comfort you find peace and it was a shipwreck got put away another one another one another one he says I don't want to drink says go get your husband she said she said well I don't have one because she was just shacked up that's what they call it state so I don't are used to know what the call now I think it's alternative lifestyle or something get on single-parent and things like that you know they've manipulated circumstances through words trying to dress it up they don't call it sodomy anymore they just call it you know alternative lifestyles dress it up a little bit but sin is still sin she said when I ain't got one he said well it's a good thing you said that because you've had five and the one that you with now ain't yours she said now the spirit was quickening the word that was in her he said the Holy Spirit will bring to you the remembrance of things that I've spoken to you but now these things that was talked to her that she's looking for now are becoming a reality through inspiration she's looking at the same man those Pharisees looked at she's looking at the same one pilot looked at Herod looked at the high priest looked at same man no halos no great miracles signs and wonders and he said I thank you Father you hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent they couldn't have seen it because there was a veil over their hearts and their minds was blinded but he inspired her she said I perceive you're a prophet as soon as she found out he was a prophet we're talking about a representation of God on earth the voice of God wife anybody knew where he was this prophet would not work his Hoss so she said we worship up here and you worship down there but what church should I go to where can I find him his presence not just a better Church not just a different kind of worship she was walk behind them because something down in here was calling he said well he said no you worship up there you don't know what you worship because they were in idolatry to begin with and their King didn't have any royal blood because he was a he was the son of a servant of Solomon so he didn't have no royal blood even though that God gave him ten tribes and he didn't have no royal blood and he called a clergy together and they weren't God called even though he did his best he got the low ones and he didn't get the real smart and high educational he got he got the low ones build up a couple churches for him to go to and golden calves he didn't want to go back and get converted he just wanted to stay him under his power and security even though that he knew that God gave those ten tribes he was insecure then God called you the pastor to church it's not your church as his search then he said as many as hear your voice I tell you you're sent to and if they leave and go to another church I don't make them Antichrist he don't let any live out from among the Saint I was that's in security trying to control people through fear and intimidation what we need to do is get them filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost to take care of Holy Ghost are bringing the church not programs no not all kinds of picnics and great speakers you know this church fill up you bring certain celebrities here and it's not because of them it's what the people's made on them bring a certain ministry here had packed the town out with believers but it's a Holy Ghost when he comes and he comes through the he comes from people that they want to be champions and he comes through there Lily comes for anybody that will render themselves to him and he come to feed his people you know what the manna was sent for it was sent to teach them humility the man who was sent to teach them you my own teaching humility because they couldn't go out there and store it up Samantha had to come every day the Living bread what is the man it's the embodiment of nutrition of everything the human body needs every vitamin every mineral everything that you need for health your immune system I don't care what it is it was in the embodiment of that manner and he brought the water the water in the manna but now he said you go out every day and you get a little bit for that day but you know the ones that were insecure they didn't believe the message of Moses and they didn't believe that there was a God it was something they didn't really know about but now you know sometimes man gets ahold of spiritual things anything she knows everything is what I know what we do I know what Moses said but you know what we're gonna do we're gonna save up for a little bit tomorrow just in case nice and so far we'll give them everything but we'll hold back just a little bit just in case a rainy day and this thing falls through and security when they gathered up that extra turns the worms and Moses said all you always you know he do unbelievers you know you don't believe the word don't believe God and he teaches us to live by his word every day you know the revelation you got five years ago ain't gonna work for today that's why when the saints come together we assemble ourselves to see if God's going to bring something to us if we're in the faith if we come expecting to get some mana that's the way he chose to feed you without him we can do nothing we cannot sucess without him neither can creation everything was created by him and for him and what it consists it stays active because of him he holds it up he didn't just create it and turn it Lucy it's a spirits assist by him they said okay we got that revelation all right here Saturday in our Friday I guess have been in the Old Testament that's ago I know wasn't it he said now I want you to get enough for them all oh it says pastor I wish he'd make up his mind first he says don't save it nice just save it says don't make no idols now he tells us to make two cherubs always trying to figure God out trying to get God in a box or some kind of a schedule I don't know whether we ought to save it tomorrow or not you're supposed to listen to the voice the manna was to teach some humility what is humility not my will I will to depend upon him every day so we find now that that down through those dark ages down through the Reformation that the strength was prophecy revealed and what do we see the Antichrist doing well these paranoid heretics idiotic people that believes this Pope is the great that's exactly what he is what happened to the Lutheran Church the I prophecy was put out and here about ten years ago in the paper it said all but about two to ninety-five theses all of those points had already been resolved they've just on the last two because once it prophecy once the light is put out once it Isaac he couldn't see had to go by his feelings as smell is hearing sounded like Esau smelt like he saw felt like he saw but he didn't have the discernment his eyes have become dim and he couldn't tell the difference between the two spirits between the two sons and we're to have the wisdom in the last days to be able to discern between the two spirits he said from his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding but God giveth wisdom so we can have knowledge and understanding but without wisdom it won't do us any good and that comes from God not man but it comes for knowledge and understanding look at acts 15 for a moment we just look at that a minute and then we're just kind of closed acts 15 here's what I really wanted to preach on but it just I love David I love Paul but I just seen something just about David seems like kind of attracts me but anyway here in acts 15 now this is approximately according to one Bible this is 50 ad so 33 AD was Pentecost about that time so now 33 AD and 50 ad we're talking about 17 years give or take 17 years so now we're in a dispensational change because it changed from the first covenant or the Old Covenant to the second Covenant to the New Covenant according to Jeremiah 31:31 233 and God says I'm going to give you a new covenant it's not going to be like the old when I brought you up out of Egypt and I gave you the Ten Commandments I gave you my my my word written in stone and then and then it was turned over to you and the first covenant it all hinged and depended upon your ability to perform and even if your performance was perfect he still couldn't come in the presence of God so even though that you were perfect and blameless in the law it never brought the righteousness to bring you in the presence of God all it did was let you know that she was a sinner and you needed Redemption and then next year every sacrifice you all offered was a reminder and pointed you to your sin but he said I'm going to give you a new covenant and in this covenant I'm gonna do something different I'm not gonna write it on tables of stone I'm gonna write it in your heart and it's not going to be based upon your ability to perform but it's going to be based upon faith in my ability to perform it's not what you're going to do it's what I'm gonna do and your faith is going to be in what I do and I'm going to write it in your heart in other words I'm gonna put a nature in there that doesn't make you a law keeper but it makes a law FULFILLER why did coordinators why did he get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ well because so he could be a believer in going rapture no he didn't he already had the Holy Ghost he was sealed unto the day of his Redemption that's what the scripture said Peter said they receive the Holy Ghost just like we did so he was born again he was sanctified he was justified sanctified and born again and sealed unto the day of his Redemption in other words if he had said well Peter I know what you're talking about but I got the Holy Ghost and I'm sealed and I'm going in the rapture and I'm going to heaven I don't need to get baptized he could have said that and he still would have gone to heaven but there was a nature change and when they as you know we have to have the more harmony another and I'll show you it said he commanded them be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and the spirit that was in him responded to that voice he didn't care it was a demand a command or what it was he didn't have to have an altar call he didn't have to have a whole bunch of tears and patting and priming he was obedient to the word because the life and him was obedient to that Living Word so now here we are 50 80 and there's an infectious-disease coming into the church because these men have come down from headquarters they come from Judea you know who their pastors was John Peter James they said you know who we sent around a campfire with we heard it straight from their lips Peter you know who we walked with you know what church we belong to James you know who you know Jesus a brother we sat in his church this is where this revelation comes from I had letters of certification they said I hear this church was when the church was scattered out abroad and in rem acts 8 there were some believers that went up there and it said wherever the church went they preach the word they were the first missionaries and then Philip and the Apostles never left Jerusalem so when it ends up you tell me who's going to be the last missionaries it'll be the church it's not going to be the ministry because when she comes to perfection the ministry is no more because the ministry is until and then we will reach that point of maturity and security and to that place of perfection the ministry isn't needed anymore the Lord brought us to Christ the ministry brings us to perfection and unity but when that comes there is no more ministry because that's the purpose and some people don't want to lose her job so they hold back a few secrets to keep you from coming to perfection in fact I saw a few seeds that you'll war and bitterness and Indians that you need them that's what the Catholic Church said unless you get communion through our priests you cannot go to heaven so they made them dependent on the church and some people are trying to make you dependent on his church a building a pastor without him we can't do anything without him if we gather tonight and the Holy Ghost is not here we're just a bunch of religious sinners gathered together but he is the church in the body makes the church by one spirit were baptized into one body that's the church now there's an infectious disease coming the roots of legalism trying to come in and and marry up with with grace like a woman with a living husband trying to marry a man you know it won't work her man married out here two three times trying to get another wife trying to blend the two together but the first time has to be dead the law was dead the end of the law for righteousness ended it Christ it was not what they thought it was how they saw it what they thought was righteousness but how they thought it through the law was wrong and they because they sought it by their own revelation they rejected the plan of God now this disease was coming into the church and so we find Peter stands up and he gives his testimony man I had the keys to the kingdom he talked about a position nobody could get saved no Gentile could get save until he opened that door Peter Paul himself if he would have preached and laid hands on him and baptized him he too got the same results Philip did they could have got justified and sanctified but the Holy Ghost could not come until Peter opened that door he opened the door to the Jews and there in Samaria Philip went down preached brought him out out of witchcraft they believe the gospel repented baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they had the mechanics but where was the dynamics it didn't come so fast no speak in tongues I know what I'll do I'll go to church 10 times to the five time all he can do is wait on him we're waiting on him for the rapture and then Peter they didn't know what to do Peter didn't go down so you need me it was a circumstances God according to this great symphony brought Peter down he laid hands on him and they received the Holy Ghost and the dynamic struck the mechanics and then he goes over to the Cornelius's house and he opens up the door he said you know who's got the keys of the blood you know that's what the Catholic Church says the Pope got the keys the blood he says you know you know who ate fish with him but we find that he didn't appeal his own personal relationship with Christ but he appealed to the revelation that he had that was vindicated a vision given to a prophet thus saith the Lord and it was fulfilled exactly manifested and here comes a word prophet Paul because said well that's alright Peter you know you had a good a good experience but after the resurrection you know who Jesus came to you know who the fifth pillar fire came and called out and said you're special to me Paul you're a chosen vessel and I'm gonna use you to be a light you know he could have appealed to all that Dwight man does you know his great achievements and relationships but he didn't he went right straight he said we preach the gospel to the Gentiles and they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and born again and not one of them was circumcised because it's a circumcision in the heart not the flesh and that was fine but you know they sat there and they thought you know it was pretty good message that was a pretty good message but they were waiting for something garden in psalms 107 he says he said his word to heal him and to save them from that affections disease or destruction he also says in Malachi 4 he said those that fear my name and the name of God is the manifestation of his word as many as receive him who's him Jesus know the pillar fire made flesh in Jesus now it's the pillar of fire today made flesh in his word it's still Jesus the Living Word he's living today as many as received him what the Living Word made manifest what's Peter say Peter said he is that rock he's a rock of offense that people stumble that even the word of God so that rock that that David wrote about a stumbling stone then you've seen it it came down down out of the out of the heavens at a mountain or a rock cut with our hands and it came and it stood with two legs then jesus said have you not heard that raaah that was rejected of the great builders they knew that he was speaking of them they thought we're gonna kill this guy he was that rock he was a living Word made flesh and Peter says you are living stones what living word part of that stone which is a stumbling stone what is it it's a prophetic word made flesh they come down to the end and everybody was sitting there and all of a sudden inspiration struck James and he stood up and he says now we've heard what Peter says and he don't refer to Paul he just says we know what Peter said he says and just agrees the prophets in other words soul agrees the Word of God prophets in other words lighted come to James and modern days hence was to be interpreted illuminated by prophecy fulfilled so says the scriptures that I will build again the tabernacle of David and it referred to the circumcision after he quotes the prophecy then it says now the question is settled they'll not be circumcised prophecy revealed broad illumination onto the events of that day that they could understand what was taking place and Jesus said on this rock I will build my church in other words the same voice that spoke in Amos 9 that said I will build again the tabernacle of David that is the bride the body of Christ is the tabernacle of David it's not in the Millennium it's now you know what what Joseph did was a shadow of things that was to come sold out by his brothers rejected is he a spiritual went into prison one site one died right hand of Pharaoh right so what was what was happening to the Joseph was a shadow of something that was to come and David you know it's strange but when Israel came in the time of Joshua and they they took the land and after he he he died and they finished taking their land you know there was one place that they couldn't captain captivate they couldn't conquer there was a Jeb you sight Citadel or as Jebusite fortress on Mount Zion that was one place that they could not conquer and David when he came to this Rome and when he came to the throne of the 12 tribes you know the first thing he did he went up there and broke the seals he went up there and took that Citadel and David built it and it was called a city of zone zone nobody could do that but David he was part of his ministry and he he conquered that mount sound and you know what the first thing he did he said I want God in the midst of the church ain't good enough for me to be pastor but I want the presence of the Holy Ghost here I want his throne in the midst of Israel yeah now I will build again the tabernacle of David you know what it was it was a tent it was just a tent like he'd go pitch a tent to camp it wasn't he didn't go out and some special array or anything he pitched a tent just a tent now remember here that tent it wasn't it wasn't a temple of Solomon and it wasn't a tabernacle of Moses it was a tent and God didn't tell him to do it and God didn't give him a blueprint for it why was it the tabernacle of David and not not the temple of Solomon that he was going to build again why wasn't the tabernacle of Moses Moses represent a law but here it was just a tent that tent was you that's it was me it was Paul it was Peter those martyrs that died down through the church age he said I'll build again but why did David build it why was it David Moses built it by instructions Solomon built it because of his daddy wanted to build it and it was given to him to build it but why did David did it because it came out of the love out of his heart that he wanted he wanted Christ he wanted he wanted God in the midst of the people he was the true king he wanted he wanted God in the midst that's why God wanted that go he looked down he said one day I'm going to build that tent you and I are that tent we're the body of Christ and in that body we make up the temple of worship and David went he tried to bring the Ark and remember he didn't do it according to the word and God's not gonna let you do anything that's not according to the word didn't get baptized and Father Son and Holy Ghost all today you want to but you're gonna have to come his way you ain't coming he said a voice he's done a prophet to prepare your hearts he didn't send the theologians in the church he himself came and spoke through that mouthpiece so David he went back praying he said I see what it is according to the word it has to be carried over the hearts of the Levites they can't be a tradition like the old denominations like the Philistines it worked in that day but it won't work today they brought it brought the ark back into the land but now I've got to bring him to zone so he took those he took those priests him he got all sanctified and he got that ark and they put it over their shoulder I don't know her heart you know the ones on the right it was on the left ones on the left it was on the left because it had to be over the heart he wasn't symmetrical the window ones on the outside ones on the outside but it was outside in time I'd be over the heart may not look good may not look logical that's the way God wanted it and he said they took about six or seven steps and you want to happen instead of stumbling it said that God strengthened them all when you get in that word you care we're supposed to be not with muscle but over the heart in love many of strengthen you virtue and it said he went to fetch the ark to bring it to his place the ark his now we're not French we're not Spanish there was no gender it wasn't just because he was a table him or a chair her it was the ark him he went to bring him and the ark represented the presence of God and the Living Word of God he went to bring him to his place where was his place he was in that tent because when he built the tent the tent was calling for the ark because David pitched that tent for the purpose of the ark coming and that tent was crying for the ark so when he went to get the ark he went to bring it to his place when you build a house you know you take abandoned houses and they they just deteriorate and fall down seems like three times faster than a house with a family living in it what because a house calls for a life and the family is the life of that house there something about a family that lives in a house that it will spend it'll decay after a while but you take an abandoned house and without any life in it it just falls down and that tent were calling for the ark because David in his heart had built it for the ark he said that's the church that I want that's the tent that I'm gonna make and then David this is kind of strange David's dressed underneath hug you know what that is that's a priests garment white linen you know it's white linen that the high priest puts on on the Day of Atonement you know what the white linen represents he takes off it they call it his robes of glory he takes off the high priest he takes off his robes of glory he's already offered up the daily morning sacrifice because he does all the sacrifices that day so he offers up the sacrifices and the things but now he's getting ready to offer up the sacrifices of the day of atonement you know what he has to do he takes off his robes of glory he takes about five or six and a seven and then he puts on this white linen you know what the white linen that he took off his robes of glory and he came down and clothed himself in humanity and here comes David dressed in an ephod white linen you know what he is he's in a priests robe now David was never a priest but brother Branham refers that when he opened up the Garner's the priest Garner's that he had access and God didn't rebuke him from bringing that that weed out for the people he was actually taking the place of a priest when he opened that up David was never a priest but now he's dressed in a nice Cod and he's bringing the the Ark the word to his place and so he comes up and when they bring the ark to the tent David offers up burnt sacrifice you know when when Saul did that God rejected him and he lost his whole kingdom he lost its room David offers it up he offered up burnt offerings David did and God accepted that and there was no more sacrifices one sacrifice once and for all for eternal Redemption and there was no holiest of holies in there and he placed the ark in there and offered that burnt sacrifices and then you know what he did he gave meat and wine and bread to the people at that moment in time and only David can do this because David was of the tribe of Judah and wordid milk has dick come from he sprung out of the tribe of Judah of which Moses never spoke of any priesthood at that moment of time when the word was coming to his place David stood and foreshadowed Melchizedek that one day a mighty angel was going to stand with that word the message of the bride and he was going to give it to John to eat and the fullness of the word was coming to his place in her heart or in the day when the word the fullness of the word is coming to his place and she becomes him and the manifested sons of God but you know what Satan does want to do why is he gonna put the squeeze why is he gonna try to take the bride out because the light of the body is the eye and where's the eye it's you to rebuke that man it says why you're nothing but a bunch of paranoid fanatics then that's the word of God he's the Antichrist and you'll find out one day America bow down to her but the bride won't because the light of prophecy and if the eye be healthy if it's anointed with their eyes have of the Holy Spirit then the eyes the light of the body this is the Eagle Age under the Eagle anointing now I tell you the word is coming to his place because she in him for one it potentially been that way in that day now down through the church ages he said and I'm gonna close he said Philip have you been so long with me that you don't know who I am why if you would have known me if your revelation that as I heal Lazarus and as I raise the dead and the leper and and they say if if when you walked with me if your revelation would have progressed you were to come to the point that you would have known who I was if you'd have known who I was you'd have known who he was he said have you been so long that you don't know who I am until when you've seen me you've seen him so down through the church ages they were living off the revelation of the true revelation of the Godhead but something's different to come he said John 14 20 in that day you'll know I'm in him and him and me that's the Godhead and I am you and you and me oh wait a minute now but they had that revelation under the new birth but it was to come to a completion in this day inspiration he said that prophecy spoke of this day in that day you know that I'm him and him and me oh but I am you and you and me when she looks in the mirror and recognizes who she is she'll know as he is known yeah you don't have to worry about insecurity you don't have to worry about control we're almost we're one step into eternity look at look at everything that's taking place but I'm looking for the inspiration to strike revelation yet that walks away the voice of the ministry not all but what's the general pull I ain't looking for Pope's ain't looking for years well those things are fine but I'm looking for that revelation the inspiration to come because the rapture is a revelation it's the inspiration on that revelation we're not looking for a new ministry and a new idea a new thought everything we have need of us in you now it's in this message but God controls that by a key it won't be based on your conduct but it'll be based on his sovereign will at the time that you have need of it he will inspire you for the faith to stand in the moment that you're standing he will grant us the inspiration to say death just leave me alone people have tried to manufacture that and they're dead today but one day that revelation will come out of you and you know that you won't go by way of the grave but don't try to manufacture it don't work it up wait for the dynamics to strike the mechanics and if living day by day is racing by inspiration and you ain't going to come up at the last day and get it it took me 73 years to get where I'm happy I never thought I'd get here now I just wonder if I was ever back there I got a look at pictures yep yeah yeah I was old my brother-in-law's my wife went over there and they were showing videos and and family photos back when we was out in the world there I was him a lot of hair and white beautiful dark hair and there we was running around she was in her shorts my sister-in-law was in her shorts we his hunting Easter eggs and always having a good time we like we watched two hours of slides and videos and then we was through as I was going to go to the bathroom and they got one of these bathrooms it's just a what do you call it a 1/2 bath I guess it had a sink and it has a the toilet term and so I went in there and when you walk into it the sink is over here and it's got a mirror in the toilets over here so I went over here I went to the bathroom and I turned around I start washing my hands and I looked up and I saw this old man looking at man yes Charlie I've been looking at myself so long then when I looked in the mirror looked like an old man looking through a window at me I came out of the bath and just laugh and they said what do you like laughter I just scared myself for that moment I forgot who I was it was so funny because inside it just you know how sometimes something else carry on inside you go but on the outside you just like this Nathan oh you sure are calm but on the inside you knew you jumped about three feet you know and I just inside I just jump when I did I knew it was Lena I just started laughing this old man look at that man I never knew I'd be looking into that old man Here I am but one day looking at young man and it won't be the man that I looked at back there it'll be a glorified behind you well be the same eyes same features all you talk about realities brothers and sisters we need paranoid fanatics Wayne paranoid heretics we ain't even secure people trying to use Jesus as a crutch something's changed you talk about miracles just you've been in church and believed in this message this message will rip the hide off you it doesn't show favoritism it doesn't spare nothing cuz you're right down to the heart to the root call sin sin and you need to repent for perish here's not two ways there's one way Christ it's not another gospel none another Bible but the ark he's come to his place he's been out here no place to lay his head he's been in the land but he wasn't in his place but now that lamb stepped forth with a book everything that's me redeems in that book Israel's in that book birth is in that book here in that book foolish virgins in that book he says revelation five he says everything that's to be redeemed is in that book but now here comes another mighty angel Christ and he's got in his hand not the book he's got a little book because in that book of life there was a section called the Lamb's Book of Life the very elect that book was written before the foundation of the world and he was on that book the earth Israel has an unconditional covenant through Abraham if your name was on that book you tell me who's got an unconditional covenant he was saying before you got here he was sealed on a holy oath before you got here the Bible said we have received an inheritance being predestinated then if I have a heritance and the kingdom of God is because I was written predestinated how did you get the Holy Ghost it says the Holy Ghost is the first fruits the earnest of my inheritance how'd you get your inheritance predestinated how'd you get the Holy Ghost predestination [Applause] Laurie because that seed was crying for life and God answered the voice of that seat oh what a day we're living in why is he attacking the cloud prophecy it's not attacking doctrine the cloud why the cloud believe the sign they pointed everybody to to the cloud and the supernatural what about the word once they put that I of the Lutheran Church out doctrine didn't make no difference why why is it that the churches are sitting on the platform of that Pope because the eye has been put out and if your eye be sick and unhealthy and you need the eye salve to go on it the light that's in you is darkness the light that's leading the churches is darkness ignorance void of God but the bride the I what the after is after the eye he took Satan's eyesight but one thing about it and he was treading out that corn he began to realize why he was there he said all he said I know where I made my first mistake you know what the first mistake was he didn't listen to her mom and dad he didn't submit himself to headship he wanted his way I've been down there I found this girl I want to marry her Oh son she she's a Gentile can't you find somebody here in the church I believe I want her okay son that's what he made his first mistake now here he was blind a prisoner to those that he was called to conquer treading out the corn he had to thinking he said that was a mistake one that led me to this and it led me to that sin will take you farther and you want to go sin will keep you longer and you want to stay sin will cost you far more and you want to pay there he was and he's our old God just this once more that these Philistines that the church might see the power of God and as tell him brother bless you come in with his little briefcase I said there's a boy with a lunchbox that's what you mean boy at the lunchbox brother Brown said there they was leading them my blind church had to strengthen him but he was blind he said Here Come a little boy with a lunchbox had that man with him what that boy represent his eyesight revelation your largest scent the turn the hearts back and he led him to those two pillars and they destroyed that church just a little boy with a little lunch box there's a little boy with a couple fish five loaves of bread God can do much a little man does a little as much but if we could just lead ourselves to him all through him were more than conquerors as a child I foolish lady turn God away I turned him away three times in my life as a sinner I knew there was three times I look back that he drew close to me and each time I turn him back one time was when my daddy died and I had gone to church I was over Vietnam and I don't even know why I went to church and and then a week later after I'd went to church I told his friend of mine we're getting drinkers and stuff and I said let's go to church he said do what I said let's go to church he said you gotta be crazy come on let's go I wished I knew what that meant preached week later I got a message from the Red Cross your daddy's dying you got to go home I got home I got Oakland California called my mom she living in New Mexico that's where I was raised I said mama how's daddy doing she said well via him tell you then I said to what he's dead she said you don't commit suicide shot himself in the head with a gun I hung up the phone I said I'll never serve a god like that because you know the legalist what he does I do that if you do this and if you don't do after I've done for you I mean I've gone to church I quit my drinking quit my smoking ayudarnos and you won't even do this for me well I won't serve you because that's what illegal is is it's a deal you pat me on the back I'll pat you on the back but he made me out a liar because here I stand serving him and I said I'll never serve a God like that so has a child I foolish they turn God away not knowing the heartache the sinner must pay but God in His mercy let me return and there with his children his lesson I learned sin will take you farther then you want to go sin will cost you far more and you want to pay so with pleasures and promises send to control leaving me dying with nothing to show there with David standing between two graves a little baby and a man that loved him a warrior man that he committed adultery with his own wife and he put him out in the battle and had him killed to hide his own sin he tried to manipulate the word to hide his sin but the word called him out and exposed his sin and there he was standing so with pleasures and promises send to control leaving me die and let nothing to show gone were my loved ones and my dearest friends only Savior could love me again not where is he he's right here he's at you and me not mercy like a pull with strings of time but the mercies of God coming through the Word of God through you and me as we've got heads Heavenly Father may you bless his people for their patience and Lord may you strengthen them as David said a God of my strength send thy light and I truth that it might guide me that it might lead me it might take me into thy presence tonight Tabernacles fall on there I'll worship you in spirit and truth send me to the sent send me to the loss let me live this life let me give them something Lord in this world like you gave the woman at the well may we be bring her fourths of life of living water may you grant that to each one father and may you bless them in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen brother lusha to come amen a man named Anthony man thank God for the word hey man and I won't keep you too long go try not to wear the grey sir God but he touched on so many things brought out so much and when you go home read again the scripture that he referred to in Matthew chapter 6 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so where is your heart be honest now with God because he knows where your treasure is there will your heart be also and the light of the body is the eye this it really struck I starts destructive the light of the body is the eye and if therefore thine eye be single the whole body should be full of light they may walk in the light as he is in the light that we might have fellowship one with another having the same motives the objectives attitude spirit work has we got the same anointing so we're all reflecting the same person Christ hey man they see you they see Christ he see me you see Christ they see this brother they see Christ his sister they see Christ you're not all living the same lives you all have the same spirit desires that's right what anointing is on one is on the other what and it causes this brother to do this this sister to do that they're all like oh yes I press with trust by the grace of God make your calling and election sure make sure you've got the the the Holy Ghost anointing in your soul that's right and it'll produce the same life as the other brother or sister who's got the old legal anointing in their soul a man not again is good not just doctrine as he said this judge the devil believes it he does when it comes to the doctrine and but here you try to get you to go around something else go run something else here and there brother's sister it's the life of Christ the bride is going to have the same spirit the same anointing and the way one acts the other one will act or react way one does this or addresses or talks they will all have the same the same motives objectives anointing from the inside of the inside by the grace of God yes I thought about it while our brother was ministering on it what some things he was saying with a prophet of God said you can have the anointing he said in your flesh and go to hell you can have the anointing he said in your human spirit and go to hell and that'll cost you to do this and do that and do something else so you're still going to hell but he said where you need it is on the inside of the inside in your soul where God controls there from the soul he said the soul is God's control tower he said the head is the devil's control tower Amen so let's live from the soul by the grace of Almighty God so he said he if thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light amen we haven't got two objectives we got one come back to the work and just walk in the light of the word stay in the middle of the road by the grace of God and it's just but if thine eye be evil thy whole body should be full of darkness and therefore the light that is in thee be darkness amen first time I heard that brought out the way our brother brought Luke tonight praise the Lord Oh let's take heed unto the revelation there up that the light not become darkness hey man if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness do it why I'll read it quote in just a minute here how great is that darkness so close to deceive the very elect is impossible that's right gonna be ninety ninety nine point nine fifty-nine percent light maybe 0.1 percent dark butter the eyes are caught it's all dark because it's gotta be the whole words or nothing not all truth nothing but the truth hey man man shall not live by bread alone but by every word just thinking of that read that scripture with Revelation what you heard tonight amen god forbid that the light is darkness in the eyes of God Amen why well we see all the doctrines and this and this and this and this God looks down and just sees that one thing that one word you skipped the enemy caused us to skip over a man let's not deny one word if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness it is great for no man can serve two masters that's right for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and men hey man the enemy is not going to deny the light hey man you know what God has done you try to add to it take from it but he won't deny it god help us amen to understand prophecy as our brother was ministering pre-eminence giving God the preeminence not just in church in your home in your education in your job it's not what you want what does God wants a man just too much today of doing what people what they want I believe the doctrine so I could do what I walked do this do this do this is hit the will of God again our brother brought it out not my will don't be done wonderful and again when he was preaching on David to come to me a David was a man after God's more heart it's Jesus there's are you as we're after God's own heart Jesus knew David was after God's own heart are you after God's honor a man even even oh thank god they're from the foundation of the world the lamb was slain for our sins if not God would have wiped Adam and Eve off the earth and started all over again but the lamb in the mind of God was predestinated and slain before the foundation of the world knowing what was going to happen even for David hey man because the Bible says the law if a man do this this he had to be killed God didn't kill him God corrected him God Chasen to test sized him and God pointed all others back to David why because he was a man after God's own heart on the inside he wanted God and God knew that what happened was the influence of Satan in his flesh it wasn't in his heart god help us and I'd like again what he brought out and reminded us concerning the right spirit and wrong doctrine the prophet of God said I'd rather fellowship with a brother who got a wrong doctrine on the right spirit then he said somebody with a right doctrine and a wrong spirit a man he said least he said if he got a right spirit we can change his doctrine God can deal with it you know but if your spirit is wrong it's nothing we can do amen the Prophet said he said you got to have a right spirit and right doctor and now if you get a right spirit and right doctrine now you got a cake on the way he said hey man grace praise the Lord make a comment on I'll skip most of this here he referred to David and the 10th and breaking the Ark of the Covenant he did the taped some years ago I preached on the 10th vision and the Ark of the Covenant was brought into the tent hey man it was the fullness of the revealed word by the grace of God hey man and where do we where's God find us in the tent in the Holy of Holies hey man because that's where the Ark of the Covenant was that's where the revealed word is it's in the holy of always he meant God requires more of us in the S any other generation man so really I know some would disagree I have preached it that the Dead vision that's the third pole we're in the tent we're here in the tent hearing the reveal word you heard it tonight what and and eating the manna that never goes stale praise the name of the Lord Alleluia it just goes right on into eternity praise God so and he preached he mentioned something about the flashlight I don't know if you had one there or something like one well I thought about something that happened some years ago in the Empire Avenue a man I was wanting to have two brothers and sisters with that were there would remember but I was preaching one night and and the power went out it's on a Sunday night I believe it was and the power went out and well we had a flashlight so we had a large flashlight there by the pool bar under the pulpit and and so I took it out turned it on brother Bob came up took the flashlight shined it onto the boo-boo and I kept on preaching so I could see my notes and so I could read the scriptures so I can read the quotes hey man so so the flashlight served a purpose yeah it's like following birth father it was the light on the light Brian he was seeking he was speaking of course during the flashlight show sort of people who quote at the door but by the grace of God we were that I was gonna keep on preaching so so we thank the Lord for that and we did go right on and then our brother just I can worst I can remember our brother Paul now standing to my on my lap there and I like that with with the heart and on my left and and he was there with holy hope the light like this as I kept on for it you kept on preaching a man so brother look no matter what if you're doing it for God the devil is gonna try to stop yet but you'll keep on moving because God is gonna provide yeah God's gonna provide the help you need they may praise the name of the Lord a man now just let me finish with this man and again and encourage you take the time we take a lot of redeem that we redeem time for a lot of things we redeem time for a lot of natural things a lot of carnal things how much time do we read DVD for God and the things of God how much time every redeeming for the body of Christ just Wednesday just Sunday just a special services like we're having redeemed the time the Bible says because the days are evil I find more and more believers so call a redeeming time for natural things carnal things I'm a believer I can do this and sure you can do it too thing if it is if you got the Holy Ghost he takes a way to desire for it he wants you to do the will of God not your will not my real father thine be done oh we like to do this we like to go here we want to do this we want to do that well now yeah well let's find my son that's find my daughter but can I use you for something else are you serving the body are you helping the body will somebody pay a price if you go and do what you want to do instead of I what I want you to do how many are living for one another Christ lived and died for us how many are living and dying for one another I'll tell you this world is my guess and is worth more real to the - to the people than the world to come the kingdoms of man are more real than the kingdoms of God kingdom of God and as I was I would listen to our brother Andre was it in central and if fellowshiping was some of the brethren there and I said listen I said people want to stay more than they want to go because I said they have they have ideas motives objectives what I want to do this I want to do this and wonder something else laying aside and said Lord willing Paul said that he said no matter what your plan just say Lord Willie keep your mind on the resurrection on the rapture on the change the will of God hey man you bird the word tonight come back and stay with the word in 1951 April 1951 now hard to believe that this would be the title of his message 1951 the angel and three poles 1951 he was just barely into the second Pole and he said he had to wait nine years for the third Pole amen and this was in Phoenix on a Saturday and he said he said-she people a long time ago you wouldn't have come to God and got yourself settled down know where you were standing the Bible said in the last days that there be a famine not for bread alone but for the hearing of the word of God and it is there's a family but God has fed us to me a man he fed us when our brother was here before that was tremendous and he said there be a famine not permitted long before the hearing of the word of God and again it's the true Word of God and he said men would go from east west north and south trying to find it and would fail he said you better get sealed he said into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost while you got a chance you talk about a confusing time he said it's coming and he said when the Bible said he said they'd be so closed until they would deceive the very elect if possible he's prophesying this in 1951 amen when he was right into the I guess the real exciting part of his ministry the first pole second pole and he goes into expounding on the first and second pole what God was doing and what God was going to do but warning them you better get sealed now because the hour is coming when when it's gonna be so deceptive and he goes in and talks about those about those that go out and he said he jesus said they'll come to me and that day is there but I'm not done this in your name that in your name and you'll say depart from me that work iniquity I never knew you just think of that so he goes on to expound it these are preachers and so forth and everything but he'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity because that sincerity is not there that humility that humility is not there if God requires anything he requires humility for those that omble themselves shall be exalted and I mentioned a couple times in the sermon before our brother came I think it was or maybe just witnessing to somebody where the prophet of God was referring to but to have might have been brother Sharon from California and he asked a brethren and brother green was there he asked the Brethren and said brother he said why does that brother have so much power with God and the Brethren said because he prays a lot because he does this because he does that brother Brown said no no no they said well why does he have such power he said because of his humility he said he umbels himself and God exalts a man they may so what God requires in you and in me the humility we're saved by the grace of God even not works it's his work not on us amen every man that he said he's got to be born again by the Spirit of God you've got to receive the Holy Ghost to turn it down it's just the same as to turn to hope of the Old Testament down in that day or Jesus in his day some penalty and worse if you turn down the Holy Ghost he said is not the very well thought of it's talked about and all that live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution well a me and you don't try to walk around it and do avoid it no your endured for Jesus sake you love him with all your heart love Jesus let the word tonight point you to Jesus it wasn't brother Mike all take ministry tonight it was Jesus it was Jesus speaking to his bride Beverly was Jesus tried to encourage his bride it was Jesus tried to nurture his relationship with his bride so that why should they become more and more and more one man our brother brought it out and the Prophet said he said he said the bridegroom was the Alpha he said the bride is the Omega amen it was the word in the bridegroom the word in the bride amen thank God for the word tonight let's by the grace of God let's understand the prophecy give preeminence to him that gave it and fulfilled he's watching over his elect a man and Lee taking us on to perfection by the grace of God amen god bless you bless tan let's say before we dismiss tonight deeper deeper in the love of Jesus Danny let me go higher in the school of wisdom more of grace to know go deeper yet I pray and higher every day and wiser blessed Lord in thy precious Holy Word deeper higher every day in Jesus till all conflict past finds me Conqueror and in His own image perfected at last Amen let's sing it unto the Lord as we turn it to our brother Bach amen Hey [Music] she [Music] [Music] Oh praise the Lord right I'll give you a quote by brother bran I feel a religious after that Amen that wonderful is this just just to say that a man before every service we myself in the musicians go and we pray about the service we pray for a ministry we pray for everybody who comes into the door and we pray that we prayed tonight that God would lift us up into heavenly places and he did that I felt like we were climbing that ladder so nice thing about Jacob's Ladder I don't have the number well we're definitely climbing Jacob's Ladder he made one revelation after another and that's what we got tonight it's right one after another God just took us up another level very long we [Music] one day we will go up and we won't come down eternally so one more that's appropriate I think tonight all those songs were I think one more inappropriate tonight where he talked about being insecure this on this course talks about being secure 10:08 be it unto me we're gonna sing that and no clothes tonight that's part of Macondo to come and close in prayer after we sing this and 10:00 tomorrow service is 6:30 I guess everybody got from America snowed so we'll be gathering at 6:30 tomorrow night you can pray for that service hey I'm a gun just take us another room that's what we want to pray for amen so let's sing it be it unto me
