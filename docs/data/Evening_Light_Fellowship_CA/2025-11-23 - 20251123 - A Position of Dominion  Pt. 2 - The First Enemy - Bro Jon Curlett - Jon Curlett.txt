I'm going to sing that this morning. And uh and ask brother Garfield to come and open in prayer this morning. And remember to pray for brother John as he brings us the word of the Lord. And also remember of course those we pray for brother Dale uh sister Kim's mother I just continue to pray for her and we had and brother Merl of course sister Priscilla's dad as he recovers from his surgery and the request we had from brother Joe for his coworker's mother-in-law who was fainting passing out and they were trying to figure out what was causing that. So, we just ask for grace in that situation. Remember, uh, Sister Beverly has got, uh, Beverly Gail, she sent me a note last night. She's got surgery happening on Wednesday, and, uh, she's asked for prayer for that. So, we're going to remember her. She didn't say what it was for, but, she asked for prayer. So, remember her and also her grandson, Jack, who was uh, suffering with high fever at this point. So remember them and brother Doug as well. Uh the uh and brother David has a relative uh who has who's got problems especially with liver. So u we just want to remember her name is Betty regular.

Brother Chad, Sister Leah, and the family and of course, Brother Kingsley [music] and Sister Melody and that and we'll remember them uh also.

Amen. It's not in [singing and music] running but in resting. It's [singing] not in wondering but in praying that we [singing] find [music] the strength of the Lord. It's not in [music and singing] trying but in trusting. It's [singing] not in running but in resting. [music] Amen. It's not in wondering but in praying [music] that [singing] we find the strength of the Lord. [music] It's not in trying but in trusting. It's [music] not in running but in resting.

Aren't you glad for that blood? Amen. Praise the Lord. [clears throat] Nothing can wash my sins [singing] away. Nothing [music] can wash my sins away. [singing] Nothing can wash [music] my sins away.

Nothing but the blood [music] of Jesus. [singing] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord, we can only approach through your blood, Lord. It's [music] what cleans it, what cleanses, Lord. It's what divorces us from our sin, Lord. And we approach through that blood this morning, Lord. We claim nothing of ourselves, Lord, but we're claiming your blood, Lord. We're claiming the price that was paid for our sins, Lord. We're claiming the price that was paid for our healing, Lord. We're claiming the price [music] that was paid for our resurrection and rapture, Lord. We're standing under that blood this morning, Lord. And we're accepted in your sight because we've accepted that blood, [music] heavenly father. We plead it every day, Lord. Your believe your prophet said, "Never get too far away from Calvary, [music] Lord. And we're resting in that finished work, Lord. But we're resting, Lord, not just in what was done there, Lord, but what followed afterwards, Lord. That there was a resurrection, Lord. There was a a raising from the dead, Lord. There was a walking in newness of life that followed it. Heavenly Father, Lord, and that's our claim this morning is that through the blood, we can walk in newness of life. Lord, thank you for the promise, [music] Lord. Thank you for our freedom. Thank you for our healing. Thank you for our deliverance, Lord. Thank you for our provision. Thank you for our leadership that we have, Lord, by your grace at Calvary. And Lord, we're here to claim it tonight. Lord, we're here to claim it today, Lord, to just be in your presence, Lord, and be washed by that blood, Lord. be washed by your word, Lord, that we could draw closer to you once again this morning, Lord. Strengthen and encourage us, Lord, this morning for service. We pray [music] in Jesus Christ's name we ask and pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would to Matthew chapter 16. Matthew chapter 16. I've got a quite a few announcements this morning. Certainly appreciate that special, Sister Selena. A joy to trust you. Amen. That certainly feeds into our thought this morning. We'll see as we get into it. Want to remind you that we are taking up the offering for Jamaica. Quite a few of you have g given already. Lord bless you for that. But we're going to close that out very shortly so that we can send this over to them. They're very much in need of it. So if you were thinking about giving, you haven't given, then by all means send that over to brother Mark through the church account and uh we'll forward that through brother Garfield to get to brother Keith Reed down in Jamaica hopefully in the coming week. So just to remind you of that, there's no pressure. Give as you can and uh we'll trust the Lord to to magnify and make a blessing. Amen. Remember, we've got special meetings coming this week, so no service on Wednesday, but we will have service on Friday at 7, Saturday at 5:30 and Sunday at 900 a.m. Brother Billy has to leave at 1:30 p.m. So, he's basically going to preach, change his clothes, and fly out. So, we have a very early service on Sunday morning. Uh I think brother Matt said it's basically like going to work on Sunday morning. and we should all be able to make it for a 9:00 a.m. service. So, we'll keep those in prayer. Uh I've talked with brother Aaron Oglesby this week. We're looking at mid January for services with him. And I got confirmation this morning that brother Kry Diggs is going to grace us with his presence in 2026. Dates to be determined. So, we're just going to trust the Lord to lead and guide and bless us in those things. Make a way for each one to come. Amen. We've got room for brother Diggs now. He'd have taken down the old building, I think, but we got room for him to run and roam the way he does. And so we're trusting that when he comes it'll be a blessing as well. Want to remember Sister Beverly Gail. She messaged me yesterday. She said their grandson Jax had fever for two days. Asked me to pray for that which I did. But she's also going for surgery on Wednesday. She'll be in the hospital Tuesday night overnight in preparation for surgery Wednesday. So she's asking for prayer for that as well. So we want to remember her. Amen. God bless you. Matthew chap 16 and verse 24. And actually we'll read 25 and 26 as well. says, "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. We're continuing our new Sunday morning series on a position of dominion. And this morning, I want to take a a thought or a title of the first enemy. Now, last service, you remember we spoke about the first battle about for the believer on earth. And it was in the garden of Eden when the serpent serpent had a conversation with Eve and he challenged her about the word of God. And God had told Adam and Eve, "Don't touch the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Leave it alone. The day you eat thereof, that's the day you die." And then the serpent heard it and he said, "You won't actually die, but God knows that the day that you touch it, the day that you eat it, that's the day you'll become just like him. And God's just trying to keep you from becoming like him." And so he reasoned with Eve and he seduced her so completely that she believed a direct contradiction of the word of God. Church, that ought to make us wake up sometimes that that a a child of God in a perfect situation can still be seduced off of the word of God. And it takes time, but he can do it because he's got lots of time. Amen. And so she believed a direct contradiction of go of the word of God that brought all the pain and suffering that we have today. It caused natural death, but it caused spiritual death. It caused a separation from God. And Eve lost that first battle. And I want to take the step from there and see what was it that lost Eve the battle. What was it that took her down this road? We talked last service about how that Eve got away from the protection of the word. And when she did that, she was an easy target. She had no shield. She had no weapon. Amen. He had no power over her. But when she stepped away from the word, she had no protection. And she became an easy target. And she gave him power over her by stepping away from what was her power. Amen. She gave herself over to him. She stopped to have a conversation. She stopped to listen. She stopped to reason. And when she did that, she put herself in a position to lose. And if you stay in a position to lose, church, eventually you're going to lose. You can't get out from the word and stay away from it and expect victory. It's not going to happen. And so she stayed out of it long enough that it caused her to fall. She could have stepped back. She should have stepped back. The further it went away from the word, the more it should have been ringing alarm bells in her head. Get back to the word. Get back to the word. But she stayed there and she kept listening for a reason. She stayed for a reason. Why? Because what he was talking about was for her personal benefit. The way that he presented it, it was going to take her to a higher place, a a a greater reality, greater potential, greater success. She was going to be like God. She was going to have something she thought she was lacking in the first place. And he held her so powerfully because he offered her elevation above her natural position. He took her he was offering her to go higher than she thought that she was at that point. He thought he was she thought he was going to give him some her something that she had never experienced and that experience was going to be greater than what she had right there. And she didn't walk away because she was seduced ultimately by selfish desire. It was something that she thought would make her life better. Church, we've got an enemy today. There's no doubt about it. But the problem is we keep looking out there for the enemy rather than looking inwardly for the enemy. Amen. We're going to be we're going to be real pastoral this morning if that's okay. Amen. We've got to we've got to resolve the enemy that is within before we look for the enemy that is without. Amen. That's what we're looking at this morning. We're so busy looking at Satan and we forget that we've got an enemy that's built into us. This natural flesh, the natural desires, the natural inclinations, the reasoning and thinking that comes with this whole thing, church. And this whole series is on overcoming. But I've got to say this to start. Before you can win, you've got to lose. Before you can have the victory, you've got to let somebody else have the victory. Amen. That's what's got to happen. You've got to overcome yourself before you can overcome Satan. Because in yourself, you've never overcome Satan. And if your ultimate victory is going to be over him and the things that he holds, you've got to defeat the thing that holds us back in the first place. And that is self. This self will never defeat Satan. It cannot do it. It's never done it. He's been winning for generation after generation over people that thought they could beat him in themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a generation of overcomers. There's a blood seed of overcomers that has been here. But we've got to go the way of that first seed. We've got to go the way of the royal seed if we're going to have this victory that we're talking about. Amen. And the beautiful thing is we've got a template. We've got a template for how do I overcome? This whole series, if I could summarize it, how do I overcome? standing in the position of dominion, being in a place of victory. How do we do it? We've got to go the way of the original victor, the mighty conqueror, amen, that went before us and showed us the way. I'm going to take us into our own church age. This is our scripture, church. This is written just for us. It is not for anyone else. It's just for us, okay? This is Revelation chapter 3 to the Leadyian church age. This is the overcomer's instructions. Now, he said, you know, I he's told us our natural condition. He's told us the remedy. But then he says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. And if any man hear my voice and open the door, I'll come into him and will s with him and he with me." Overcoming requires that you recognize the voice of God, the message of God to your age. You got to recognize your day and its message to overcome. Noah's message did no good in Moses' day. Moses' message did no good in Joshua's day. It was a continuation. But Joshua did things that Moses never had to do. Joshua did things Moses never had to contend with. It has to keep moving. You've got to catch your message for your day and for your situation. Amen. You can't overcome without hearing it, accepting it, and acting on it. You've got to open the door to that. And he says, "Now to him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit it with me in my throne." Catch this. Even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne, he that hath an ear, let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches. Now remember, the Bible said that Jesus was the firstborn among many brethren. In other words, he's the first of a lineage of overcomers. He's a he's a first of a lineage of children of God that will walk in the same life, that'll walk in the same footsteps, that'll have the same power, the same authority. Do you hear me this morning? They'll be just like him, but they'll be little ones instead of complete ones. &gt;&gt; That's who I'm preaching to this morning. Amen. He says, "Yes, the overcomer will sit in the in my throne with me, but he says to do that, you've got to overcome the way I overcame. You've got to do what I did." Church, I love when he gives us something that says, "You got to be like me." Because it means he's got to do something in me to get me there. It means I've got a promise that he'll fulfill it because he's requiring it. God can't make a requirement and be just if he doesn't give us the means to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't do it in ourselves. So, he's got to do it in us. So, Jesus says, "You've got to win the way I won. You've got to get the victory the way that I got the victory." Church, what was the great victory that Jesus won? What do you think was his greatest victory? Was his greatest victory over death and hell? Was it when he walked on water? Was it when he healed the sick? Was it when he he he gave eyesight to the blind? Was it when he raised the dead? Was it when he took the loaves and fishes and produced it from itself? Was it when he thought spoke things into existence? Was it when he spoke things out of existence? Those are all great victories. I want to have those victories. We've had those victories. But there is a greater victory than all of that before that. Amen. Because I want you to catch something here. Overcoming is like a game of dominoes. Overcoming is a series of events that lead you to a final victory. Victory in the overcoming sense is a series of things that build up to a great victory. Okay? The final victory that Paul said, remember he says the last thing that shall be defeated is what? Death. That means there's a bunch of other things that are defeated before that. So, we've got a bunch of battles lined up before us. We've got a series of events where we have to overcome before us. It's like a game of dominoes. You've got to beat one before you can beat the next one. One has to fall before the next one can fall. Amen. But I want you to see in this life, there's an inequality to our victory. There's an inequality to our overcoming. We are the definition of inequal to what we're facing. And I want you to see this by the scriptures. Okay? Take us back to what Paul said in 1 Corinthians. He says, "But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness." So Paul says, and we remember this for later. This is key for this service. He says, "We preach Christ crucified." He says, "And that's for a reason. We preach Christ resurrected, too, but Christ crucified is the starting element. It's the first domino in this victory chain." Okay? He says, "But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greece, Greeks." So to them, hold on. It is foolishness. It's a stumbling block. But he says, "But them who are called to the true believer, to the royal seed of Abraham, both Jews and Greeks, Christ crucified is Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God." So as if we preach Christ crucified to everyone else, it's a stumbling block. It's foolishness. But to the called to us, it means that it's power and wisdom. Christ crucified is power and wisdom. Amen. Hold this thought. Now he says because the foolishness of God Christ crucified is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men. So what seems foolish to humanity is God's wisdom and what seems weak to humanity is the strength of God and it's greater than anything that we have. Foolishness and weakness is greater than anything that we have. Okay? Now catch this as he says this. Now I'm preaching to us. For ye see who's calling? Your calling. Raise your hand if that's your calling this morning. Okay. Half the church is called this morning. For you see your calling. That's my calling. Okay. For you see your calling. He's talking to you and I, brethren. How that not many wise. How that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. Look around you. And it's true. We're just regular people. We are. We're regular more or less. [snorts] Okay, that's good. It means you can identify with what he's talking about. But catch this now. But God has made do with the Come on. God has [snorts] chosen the foolish things. Come on now. God has chosen you and I, the foolish things of the world, what the world thinks are foolish, to confound the wise. And God has chosen the weak things. God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty. If you're foolish and weak, raise your hands this morning compared to what the world says. Okay, now we're moving forward. He says, "I've chosen you. I've chosen you. I wasn't forced." Anybody ever get picked last in sports? A number. And you know what? You know that they had to choose you. And there's no worse feeling I've been told. There's no worse feeling. I've been told to pick be picked last and everybody else been picking. They kind of look at you and they go, "Well, I guess I'll take her." Right? God didn't do that. God said, "Give me Elsa. I want her. I want the one that nobody else think can do it. I want the one that has nothing. slow. Doesn't know what she's doing. Yeah. God chose. God chose. God chose. And the base things. Sorry. He said to confound. You know what that word confound means? I'm going to use them to shame, to disgrace, and to humiliate the wise and the mighty. We use little people to do big things. He says, "And the base things, you and I, of the world, and the things which are despised, hath God chosen, yay, and things which are not to bring to not things that are." So the things that are not reality yet? He says, "I'm going to use those to enull to take away the things that are present with us already." So the things that seem like they can always stand, I'm going to use something that doesn't yet exist to take them out of out of existence, to make them nothing. He says that no flesh should glory in his presence. That no human being should brag in his presence. Why? Because the things that were mighty have been reduced to nothing. And the ones that have become something know that they came from nothing. You've been raised up by his grace. Amen. We're there by God's elective grace. He says, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, that according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." Let me summarize it this. God takes nobody's and nothings to destroy somebody's and somethings. Okay? That's what that whole scripture we just read. Amen. There's an inequality that we're dealing with when it comes to victory. And God says one plus one is more than a thousand. God says 2 plus two is more than 10,000 because a thousand will fall at that left hand and 10,000 at that right hand. But I won't allow you to fall down. God can take something that is so insignificant and turn it into a victorious person. That's what Paul is talking about here. God's math is not like our math. And God can do great things with little things. Now I want to take us and I want to show this by example this morning. We have something in mathematics that's called geometric growth. And this is something that we can see in a domino effect. Amen. And it's how you can get something very large to fall by way of using something much much smaller. Amen. There's this professor here that did a study on this. And and and the final domino, the one at the very end there is about 3 feet tall and it weighs about 100 pounds. Now, if I were to ask you, what size domino does it take to knock down that? And you said roughly 2/3 the size, then you'd be roughly right. Okay. But what if I handed you a domino that big, 5 mm tall, roughly the size of a SIM card, lighter than a tic tac, and said, "Knock that down." Can anybody see that from the back? Barely, right? But I guarantee if I had that 100 pound three-footer up here, you could see that. If I come up to you and I said, "I want you to knock it down with this." What would you say, brother? John, you're crazy. Can't be done. It cannot be done. And you'd be absolutely right. This thing is so small. Look at what it is. That's him putting the final piece to this puzzle there. That's this man starting a victory. And it's this tiny little piece here, 5 millime high, 1 millimeter thick. But what if you had a series of friends that was just a little bit bigger? What if you had a series of victories that was just a little bit greater than you? What if you had something on your side that was just a little bit more than what you could do in your own? What could you do then? What if there's a continuous change, a continuous growth along the path where each one was half again as big as the one before it? I want you to consider something here. This first domino is virtually nothing compared to the last one. Virtually nothing. This domino when it falls has two billionths two billionths of the energy of the final domino. Insignificant. You could take this thing and you could blow on it and it could blow and it would move. Sorry, Sister Amber. You take a SIM card and you put it there. You can blow that with your breath and you say you're going to knock down a 100 pound 3-ft tall thing with that. How you going to do it, brother John? Geometric growth is how we're going to do it. A series of victories. Okay. It can't knock down a 3-ft tall 100 pound domino. But you know what? It can knock down a 7 1/.5 mm by 2 mm block. And then that one can knock down a 12 mm block. And that one can knock down an 18 mm block. See, it just takes a little bit to get it moving along. Okay, I want you to think about this. With 13 dominoes, each one progressively larger than the other, it can knock down something that's 50% bigger than itself at each stage. So that as this one little domino falls at the beginning, see if this will roll. That's what happens. That's geometric growth, church. Something the size of your SIM card just knocked down something that was 100 pounds. You say he didn't do it. Yes, he did. He started it. He started it. Okay. It's progressive victory. It comes in stages. Okay. Let's talk about the potential for this. That was 13 dominoes. If you add another 16, do you know how big the final domino would be, church? the size of the Empire State Building, 443 m tall. So you have something this tall versus something that is 88,600 times bigger. And it all starts with one little thing falling over at the beginning. Amen. If I were to tell you that a tic tac could knock over the Empire State Building, you'd say it can't be done. It can, but it takes a series of stages to do it. Amen. Look at this. 29 dominoes and you can get to the Empire State Building. And if it was a domino, wasn't anchored, it'd fall over. Are you with me this morning? So many times what we're looking at is the Empire State Building. It cannot be moved. It cannot fall. It's bigger than me. &gt;&gt; It's greater than me. Who am I? &gt;&gt; Why should I even try? Why should I even try? Amen. And what are we doing? The thing is, we're trying to meet power with power. We're trying to meet force with force. And we're looking inwardly for that. And we're saying in myself is insufficiency. and I can't win. I can't do this. It's not going to happen. Amen. But remember, God's in the business of doing big things with little people. It's the weak. It's the despised. It's the foolish that knock down Empire State Buildings. Amen. But what starts the victory, church? What starts the sequence to overcoming? One thing has to fall. One thing has to fall. One thing has to let go. One thing has to be acted upon. Someone has to lay themselves down. Someone has to let themselves go. Someone has to sacrifice themselves for victory to happen. Someone has to say, "I'm going to lay down and trust that somebody else will pick me up so I can celebrate when the dust settles." Somebody's got to do that. Amen. Jesus says, "You've got to overcome the way that I overcome." How did he overcome? What was the great victory that Jesus had? The great victory Jesus had was not my will but thine be done. He pled, he cried. He pleaded. He he he suffered. He sweated blood. But in the end, the greatest victory he had was when he said, "Not my will, but thine be done." And when he did that, he laid himself down and he started a chain reaction that would lead to holding the keys to death and hell and the grave. So that when you and I fight, we're facing a defeated enemy. An enemy that is prone to topple if we can just make him move a little bit. Are you with me? Amen. The way to overcoming power was to lay down your free will. That's the way that he had to do it. Watch this now as we set this pattern for the first enemy. Bam. says to him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down on my father in his throne. He says now what are we to overcome? He says that's the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome. Now this is logical for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we could overcome. He says, "A quick look at these scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of his proposition." Amen. That's exactly the truth. What we're looking for is how to overcome because we can't predict every circumstance. I've said this in other services already. I don't know what you're going to face. So, I can't tell you how to deal with it, but I can tell you how to overcome because there's only one way that we overcome. And it's the same thing every time. We'll see as we go through this service and through this series. If I could tell you if you're a hockey player and I could show you a move that works all the time to score a goal, then what would it matter what team you're facing? How big they are, how fast they are, how strong they are, how skilled they are, how mean they are, how many of them there are. It wouldn't matter if I've given you the way to score a goal that nobody can stop. All you need to do is keep doing the same thing over and over again. It'll defeat it every time. It'll score a goal every time. That's what he's saying here. If you know how to overcome, it doesn't matter what you're facing, you'll get the victory anyways. He says in Matthew 4, when Jesus is tempted of the devil, he overcame the personal temptations of Satan. Personal temptations, we'll get into this in a moment, of Satan by the word and by the word only. In each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, Jesus overcome by the word. Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word. Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word. Do you see the two events there? Eve fell by personal temptation. Adam chose to disobey. He was not deceived. He was not seduced. He made a choice. But Eve was seduced. She was convinced by personal temptation. Let me say it this way. When Satan comes to you with his temptation, it's going to be personal. Satan's going to offer you something that you've been craving, that you've been crying, that you've been desiring for. Amen. It'll appeal specifically and personally to you. Listen, if you got a complex, it'll feed that complex. It'll give you something that'll take away that complex. Amen. It It'll make it'll pull to your flesh, your pride, your needs, your your desire for approval, trying to make you feel warm and warm and fuzzy, trying to make you think that you're somebody. It's going to come and it's going to appeal to you. Amen. It'll offer you what you think you've been missing all along. Okay? He'll make you think you can be somebody. He'll think you can be such a success nobody can ignore you now. He'll make you think that if he only does this then everyone will love you or someone will love you finally. Someone will accept you as you are. He'll make you think he can make you happy. And I'll tell you this, the one thing that Satan always offers is he offers you something that you can only get when your character is proven by God. But he'll offer it to you now. He'll offer you the benefit without the trial and the testing without the proving. You won't come through with gold tried is in the fire as the scripture talks about. You won't come through with godly character. You'll come through with something that will destroy you because you lack the character to control it. Amen. He says but Jesus overcame by the word. And right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer. Also, it is the only way you can know if you are overcoming because the word can't fail. You say, "I'm failing." It's because the word isn't there. Then you haven't trusted the word. You haven't let the word take its preeminence. He says, "Now notice again how Jesus overcame the world systems of religion." When he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day, he constantly applied the word. He spake only what the father gave him to speak. There was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom, for it was the wisdom of God. Remember, he's going to confound the wisdom with the foolishness of God. And it's still greater. Why? Because they can never get grasp the word. It doesn't make sense to them. But catch this. He says in his own personal life. See, we've got to separate the two. I know they're together, but for a moment, you got to see that he's the firstborn among many brethren. Jesus had his own mind. He had his own will. He had his own flesh. He was as human as you or I. The difference is he had the full deity within him. But catch this. He says in his own personal life, contending with who? Himself. This is the great battle. This is the first enemy. Amen. He says, "Contending with himself, he overcame how?" By obedience to the word of God. In Hebrews 5:7, it says, "Who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications and strong cryings and tears unto him that was able to save him from death." Anybody else been crying out lately? Lord, save me. Lord, help me. Lord, provide for me. Lord, save this one. Lord, help this one. Lord, move on this situation. Lord, do this. Do that. That's what Jesus did in the Garden of Gethsemane. He was there and he's sweating blood. He's in such agony. He's in such trial. He's in such temptation that he's sweating blood. And he's pouring out his heart as a man to God that was within him. crying out. But after that it says what? That he was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared. Though were he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. He says, what was his what was he obedient to? The word of God. I'm teaching you how to be. He's teaching us how to overcome. And we see it with Jesus. He cried. He prayed. He pleaded with God Almighty. He desired not to lay his life down. His human desire was, "Let this cup pass from me. Don't make me drink it." And God wouldn't make him drink it. But he said, "Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done." And he took the cup of death and he drank it of his own free will. Amen. How did he overcome? By obedience to what the word required him to do, regardless of how it made him feel. Regardless of what it did, church, he put himself last instead of first. He's the beginning of all creation. He's the image of God. He gave up his position. He gave up his fellowship. He gave up his holiness. He gave up his throne. He gave up that that uh uh constant uh fellowship with God day by day. He laid it all down and he took the cup of death for you and I. He died out to himself. He gave up everything and yielded himself over. And in the end, Jesus said, "Into thy hands I commit my spirit." And the domino got pushed over. He fell. He wasn't pushed. He fell. He laid himself down. Into thy hands I commit my spirit. He let himself fall to start a domino chain of victory. And what did it start with? Laying his life down. Laying everything that in his flesh he desired and laying it aside for victory's sake for the joy that lay before him. That's what the scripture says. That's you and I, church. That's you and I. Amen. How do we overcome? By yielding ourselves to the complete word alone. That's it. Amen. We lay ourselves down. We give in completely to the word of God. We die out to our thoughts. We die out to our opinions. We die out to our natural human rights. Amen. We're in Leodysa, the age of people's rights. We die out to that. So, it has no power over us. Amen. I know I've said this a million times. Amen. We don't let ourselves get led around by our feelings, by how we feel about what's going to happen if we make this decision. We can't be led around by our feelings. Otherwise, Satan will lead us around by the nose and we'll lose the victory every time. Rebes his thought in the church age. He says, "Remember, we have shown clearly all through the ages that even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the word, so the Ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word until with every age continuing to turn away, we have a final repudiation of the word by the world church system." Geometric growth works both ways. See, they're quickly going to hell. We're quickly going to eternity. But it starts slow. It starts small. They started slow. They started small. The Ephesian church just got off a little bit. But where when you look at today church, what used to take centuries to go through a church system, now they can do it in a year, two years. Look at what's happened. Look at what's happened. You look at these churches that are full of homosexuals and they're they're promoting it. Drag shows in church, singing rock and roll songs in church. I saw a priest dressed up as Dracula in the pulpit the other day. church, this is happening like this. Why? Because everything's accelerating to that final moment and we're going into victory and they're going into defeat. Amen. He says this Leo age ends in a blackout of the word. We're way past that. Not just a blackout of the word as they are embracing Satanism openly. He says thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst. He says he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word. And after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit, this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus. Now, in this series, we're going to get into the idea of gates and access points for Satan that he comes at us and how we overcome those things. But I want to just look at our humanity in general today because we're talking about self. Amen. And remember what Paul would say. Paul would talk about his self. He would talk about the flesh and he'd call it this body of death. this body of death and they'd say, "Who will deliver me from this body of death? We're in a constant fight, church. We're in a constant fight." Amen. And that was something that worked at Paul at all times. But he got the victory. Hallelujah. Romans 7 is the fight. Romans 8 is the victory. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ. Amen. But it doesn't mean the battle went away, but there was a daily dying out and there was a daily victory that came with that. But I want you to see Paul's approach. I want you to see what happened with Paul because Paul was one of those wise and mighty people. And remember, that's not who God uses. Not many are even called, but he's got to do something with them. Now Paul, now we we opened in 1 Corinthians 1 earlier. Let's go to 1 Corinthians 2. [snorts] He says, "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified. Remember that's the power of God and the wisdom of God to us is Christ crucified. It's foolishness to everyone else. It's power and wisdom to us. Christ crucified is the starting place of the template for overcoming. Christ crucified. Okay? If we die with him and we must, then we'll raise with him and we must. But we've got to die so we can raise. Amen. You got to start the play the way that he started. And then Paul says, "And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling." Now listen to what brother says. He says, "Listen to him. Could you imagine a man, a Pharisee of the Pharisees, a teacher of the teachers, a man that was trained from childhood for their ministry to be an eloquent man that was smart and brilliant to come before a class of people like the Corinthians." What were the Corinthians? Spiritual nobodies, crude, lewd, and unschooled. They had nothing on Paul, nothing to compare. He says, and he said, "Come to a class of people like the Corinthians and say, I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling." He said, "A man who turned the world, we can get the next one. The man who turned the world upside down, the greatest missionary that's ever been known, confessed that he came in weakness, not as a trained scholar, but in weakness and in fear, lest he would step off the path somewhere in much trembling. He says, because he could not trust in his own ability. Where had Paul's ability taken him before? Antichrist. Paul's ability, Paul's wisdom, Paul's knowledge, Paul's training, Paul's education, Paul's position took him contrary to Christ the word. So he says, I come to you in weakness and in fear and trembling because I got to make sure that that doesn't happen again. He says the reason he was fearing not because he was scared of anything, but because he was scared he would displease God in some way. That he get his own ability mixed up into it. Something that he had learned. He was telling them that I didn't come to you with these e this excellency of speech. He said I came to you in fear that I would come that way. That's a great trap for a preacher. I'm going to wow them into the Holy Ghost. I'm going to preach them into an experience. You can't do it. You can't do it. He said, "And I come to you knowing nothing but Christ and him crucified. And I come to you in fear and weakness and in much trembling." He says, "Listen to this man who was a warrior that had stripped himself." He says, "Amen. If there's anything our schools need today, if it's anything our churches need today is a stripping of themselves, not clothes. That's what they're doing. A stripping of themselves." Amen. Of your own thoughts and your own abilities. Strip yourselves before God. Unless you would try to do something within yourselves. He says, "I hope that gets down deep to us that you realize you've got to become nothing. Not a know-it-all, not a great somebody, but a nobody. Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me." He says, "You've got to become dust." You've got to get to a place that you know, you know that you're nothing. And don't never rise above it. For as soon as you rise above it, you rise above God. He says, "You've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus, you've got to keep yourself off your high horses." Keep yourself off your high horses. And that's for everywhere. That's for everyone. Paul continues. He says, "My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man, but in the power of God." Why? Because Christ crucified is greater than the wisdom of man. If you follow his way, that's better than anything I could ever preach to you or tell you. He says, "My speech wasn't in the enticing words of man and men's wisdom, but in the demonstration of the spirit of power." Now watch what for, Paul. Why did you do this? He says, "Power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." He says, "Oh, what a preacher. This great man who sought God." And he said, "God, I am weak and I don't know what to do. I just pray you, God, to strengthen me and take my infirmities away from me and these things so I can be stronger." Come on, we all want it. Lord, make me stronger. Lord, take away this besetting sin. Lord, take away this thing that keeps bugging me. Lord, heal me. Lord, change me. Lord, deliver me. Hey, we've got a promise for all of it, church, but we've also got a time for it. Amen. There's a time and a season for every promise in the book. He says, God spoke back to him. Said, Paul, my strength is made perfect in your weakness. And then Paul said, when I am weak, then I am strong. Yes. He said, "Then I'll glory in my infirmities, of my weaknesses, and so forth." I'm thanking God that I got all of it out of me. He says, "And when I get everything out of me, then God can come in. But as long as I have some of myself there, then God can't get in." This is the template church. Get out so he can get in. He says, "There, that's it. We smother him out." Why? by insisting on our strength so we can control so we can be strong. So we can stand on our own two feet. He says we drive him away from the poorest of us to the richest of us. From the least to the greatest, we keep God out of our lives because of who? Satan. Demons, powers of hell. We keep him out of our lives because of this guy, our own selves. I've often said, "The greatest enemy I got is myself." He said, "William Brandham." I took it and put it in myself just so we could identify this morning. He says, "The greatest enemy I got is William Brandham." The prophet of the age said, "The greatest enemy I have is not Satan, it's me." You know why we're calling it the first enemy this morning, church? Because we're blaming too many things on an enemy that has no power over us. He said, "He's the one who, William Brandon." Me. I'm the one that gets in God's way. I'm the one that gets lazy. I'm the one that gets to a place where I think I can do something about it. And when I do that, that shoves God right out of the picture. He said, "He, but I put me in there. I'm putting all of us in there." He says, "But when I can get rid of that guy, when I can get rid of that girl, when I can get to a place where he or she is out of the way, then God can come over and do things that I know nothing about, that I can't even conceive that could be done through me or with me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Eye has not seen nor ear heard the things that God has prepared for us. Not only there, but right here. When you look at the great heroes of the faith, can you imagine they thought that they would do what they would do? Do you think Joshua ever thought, "One day I'm going to speak to the sun and the moon and they will stand still at my command." No. But he did it. He says, "When I can get rid of that guy, when I can get to a place where he's out of the way, then God can come over and do things that I know nothing about." That's when God can use you. That's when he can use any of you. Not just the preachers, not just the men. He can use anybody when we get out of the way. But as long as we got ourselves in the way, then we cannot. So what's the problem? We get in the way. What does getting in the way look like? This is what I asked myself when I was studying this. What are what are the symptoms or what does it look like when we get in the way? When we've got a plan and we refuse to change it. That's when we get in the way. When we insist on our opinion, when we devo when we voice our discernment of every situation, when we insist on our ideas, when we insist on our timeline, when we decide we're going to make it happen. Now, that's that's the actual being in the way. But what are the symptoms of that? You ought to know the easiest one. I have a master in this. Frustration. Frustration is the hallmark of self-will. You know why? You know why you're frustrated? Is because it's not going your way. Because you don't have what you want. Because somebody didn't want somebody didn't do what you said they should do. Your opinion wasn't the one that was taken. Your way wasn't the way that was chosen. It didn't happen in the timeline that you set. And what happens? We get frustrated. We get annoyed. We get angry at God. We get depressed. We back away. These are all symptoms of the me monster because it didn't go our way. It didn't meet our expectations. It didn't flow through the way that we thought it was going to happen. And so when it doesn't happen, then we get mad. We get frustrated. We don't like the response. And we did all we could do and it didn't happen. And what do we do? We get mad, frustrated, annoyed, disappointed, depressed, hurt, offended. Let's take it a step further. Look at what Paul dealt with. I won't do it because I'm too weak. Paul could have said, "Listen, Lord, you won't heal my eyes. Guess what? I ain't going to write your books. get somebody else to write them. Paul had an issue with his eyes. Ever since his experience, he had an issue with his eyes. And God said, "No, no, no, no. My strength is perfect in your weakness." Paul had every right to say, "God, pick somebody that's got good eyes so they can sit there and write by candle light in the small letters. Pick somebody else." But remember that old saying, "God doesn't call the equipped. God equips the called. God gives you what you need. God doesn't pick you because you have what he needs. Amen. What was it that equipped Paul? Grace. Grace. Paul probably took 10 times as long to write his letters when he wrote them. Lord, if you would only take away this issue with my eyes, I'd be so much faster. I'd be so much better. My grace is sufficient for thee. You'll still get there, Paul. You'll still get it done. My strength is perfected in your weakness. Amen. The Lord had me write this one down for me. Getting in his way. You won't try because you might fail. You won't try because you might fail. God has had to deal with this in me. He's continuing to break me of it. You talk about pride, church, this is pride. This is pride in its rawest form. I won't do something that might make me look bad. I might fail. My testimony might fail. This facade that I've built up over decades might crack. that somebody might see, I'm not as perfect as I've made myself out to be. And what is it? We forget we are his body. We are not our own. We're bought with a price. We are his hands. We're his feet. Amen. The actions are by his will and the results are by his power. It has nothing to do with me. I'm just doing it. I love what uh brother Daryl Ward said one time. He said, "I'm not responsible for healing the people. I'm responsible for praying the prayer of faith." See, too often what happen is we attach ourselves personally to the results and the results are up to God. Try being a pastor sometime. You can get real worked up because the results don't happen when you think they should. You can preach to the people bold-faced straight. They'll come up to you, say, "That was wonderful." And walk out and do the opposite. And you can get personally attached to that. We get so personally attached to it. church, we ought to take it personally, as in it ought to mean something to us. But the results are in his hands and in his time and by his power. It's not in our doing we get results. It's by doing his will that we get results or not as the case may be. Amen. We forget the personal part is our relationship, not the results of everything else. The personal part is our relationship with God, not in what we see happening or what we don't see happening as the case may be. Look at what Jesus said to his ser to his disciples. He said, "But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant." That word servant, brother Matt means deacon. Brother Joah means deacon. And brother John and brother Grant means minister. So we look at that and if we were to pick the hierarchy of the church say bear with me in my foolishness. Who's the greatest in the church? The pastor. I'm not saying that of myself. That's what we'd say. The the hierarchy of the church is the pastors up high. Who comes right under that? The ministry. And then right under that is the deacons because they're the the spiritual policemen of the church. And what does Jesus say about us? They are your servants. They're at the bottom, not at the top. We're not here to be served. We're here to serve. The very word minister means servant. Amen. He says, "And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted." We're talking about the first enemy here. And we see that the great enemy is self-will and pride. That's the simple truth of this. Amen. It's our own estimation of our skills, of our gifts, of our ideas, our intellects, our strengths, education, whatever it might be. And we forget one thing. The comparison isn't here. The comparison is here. Listen, I may be more educated than some of you. Brother Kingsley is more educated than all of us. You know what that means, brother Kingsley? Unfortunately, zero. Brother Grant's about to get his second degree for Pete's sake. What does it mean, Brother Grant? Nothing. In God's eyes, it means nothing. See, we're so busy comparing with each other. Listen, some of you are better at things than I am, and I'm better than you at some other things as well. But that has nothing to do with it because what in comparison to God, we're worthless, useless. We just get in his way. Amen. That's what dying dying out is all about. Is when you say, "Lord, in comparison to what you have, I have nothing. I am nothing. I bring nothing. All I'm bringing is a body for you to use." That's how we approach. That's what dying out is. Amen. I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord and walking up. It took 40 45 minutes for me to get to the front and to pray and and it was a time of repentance. But I knew that I was no good. That was a great revelation for me. You know, I was headed into school. I was top of my class. You know, I was a I was I was somebody that was seen as to probably be very successful. It's not that I haven't been. But when I got in his presence, I realized I am less than nothing. I bring nothing to this table. Brokenness, pride, self-will. And in his presence, I said, "I am unworthy to be here." But I continued on for one reason. He bid me come. He bid me come even as I was. But church, I died that day and Christ rose up and I became a new creature in him. Amen. That's what I experienced that day. Amen. Because I laid myself down. Now, it's a daily dying. It's a daily crucifying. I am by no means a finished work. If I was, I'd be of all men most miserable. And you would, too. But it's a daily work that happens. Amen. But it came through a dying out where I realized with all my intellect, with all my ideas, with all my discernment. I'm nothing. I have nothing. And that's why I needed Christ. That's the great revelation is I have need of him. And he calls me. He says, let's go over to Revelation. Jesus said to himself, he that overcomemeth, I'll give him the morning star. The Bible said, he said, what is it? an overcomer. One that's overcome the world, overcome self, and overcome pride. He says, "I'll make him the morning star." What does it do? I'll shine him up and set him up there that I by my owning power will reflect my own presence in the darkness. He that overcomes will I give the morning star. He says, "What's the morning star set there for?" He says, "To reflect the sun coming." What's the morning star? It's the sun shining against it reflecting the presence of the coming of the son. It's the brightest thing in heaven in darkness. He says the brightest thing in heaven ought to be today and is today. The minister, brother Grant, Brother Gerald or the Christian. Everybody else raise your hands. Or the Christian or the spiritfilled man that is so filled with the Holy Spirit till he's forsaken the world and everything. And God is reflecting his light coming through him, warning the world that the approaching s is at hand. He says, "Oh, what an hour." That is a person that has overcome the world, overcome self, and overcome pride. If you want to see what man can achieve, look at the denominational world. Look at what they can do. The Catholic Church by the numbers is the most successful church in history. Most successful. over a billion followers, untold amounts of wealth, churches in every city and every continent. And yet they're completely off the word. No holiness, constantly changing their doctrines, constantly changing their positions, worshiping men, worshiping saints, all these different things. Go start a church and preach a gospel of Jesus loves you and come as you are and you don't ever have to change and watch the pews fill up. No problem. Not a problem to do it. But the glory of God will never grace that building. Why? Because they won't preach him. They won't preach the full word. That's what men produce. You know what God produces? a little church of 12 people in Ephesus with the prophet of the age as the pastor. 12 people. That would not be a success. Can you imagine if they said, "Paul, we trust your great gift. Go to Ephesus and do a seed church." And Paul goes there and after a year, Paul, how many you got? 12. Next year, Paul, how many you got? Still 12. Paul, we're going to swap you out. You lack. your gift is not there. See, the world would say that's not a success. But Paul had 12 that would stay no matter what. He had born again believers, not church members. He was a success nonetheless. Paul said at the end of his life, he said, "I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course." That wasn't Paul speaking. That was the Holy Spirit speaking through Paul. That was confirming to Paul, "Hey, you've done what I told you to do." He says, "I have kept the faith. Henceforth there's laid up for me for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord of the right the righteous judge shall give me at that day." Why? Because Paul came in weakness and fear and trembling and kept himself out of the way so that the power of God could demonstrate itself through his life. Paul got himself out of the way. Paul died out. Paul laid himself down. Paul could have come in power and training. And this is what the Greek says and this is what the Hebrew says. And if you compare these two and you did it. No, no, no. He never did that. He came in power and demonstration of the spirit. This is what God is, not what Paul is. And that's how the power of God worked through him. Brother Brown would say this. He says, "And God can only operate as we let him operate." You know, people want power and really they don't know what power is. See, they really don't know what goes with it. He said, "The way up is down always. If you want power, see how humble you can get." I got to knock down the Empire State Building. Lord, give me power. Get ready to lay down. He says, "Just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God. And then you've got more power than that man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise." to see because you have been able to conquer who yourself. We've got to see the enemy within that lurks no matter what. Even with the Holy Ghost, he's still there trying to gain the upper hand. Amen. Amen. Absolutely he is. He says, "You've been able to conquer yourself, the first enemy, and commit yourself to Christ." How do you overcome? Commit yourself to Christ. Take your hands off the steering wheel. He says, "You see, to humble yourself before him." He says, "That's really power." He says, "You show me a church that's humble, real humble, not arrogant. A church, just a sweet, humble church. I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it. That's right. He says that's the thing it takes. Humility, humbling ourselves before God, letting God just work through us. He says, don't have to make a lot of noise. What does that look like, church? What does that humbling look like? Laying yourself willingly, taking the fall for the sake of victory. letting go and letting God have his way. That's the song we always sing, isn't it? Let go and let God have his wonderful way. We're talking about the first enemy. But I want you to see it's a domino effect. That geometric growth that we talked about starts with you and I laying ourselves down. Not my will, but thine be done. Someone has to fall first. Someone's got to go first. Isn't that the hardest thing is to be the first one? I I appreciate this about my children. Some of them, they love to go first. This this this master of perfection will never go first. He'll let them go, make the mistakes, see how to do it better, and then beat them at it, right? That's the self. That's the flesh. I'll let other people go first so I can learn from their mistakes because I don't want to make a mistake. Because I want to be perfect. I want to be better than you. This is the flesh speaking, right? But I've got kids that'll they're like, "I want to go first." They're practically beating you off to try and go first because they want what it offers more than they want to look good. They want to have the benefit of it. They want to have the experience of it more than they care about how it looks to everybody else. They're so enthused about it. They're so excited about what's coming if they can only get this figured out that they don't care what everybody else thinks about them failing or not doing it perfectly the first time. This first victory is victory over self, letting go, letting God have his way. We look for great victories. We're looking for great victories. We're looking for great testimonies. We're looking for the signs and wonders of God that he would do in our midst. We're looking for deliverance. We're looking for salvation. I long for the day when Sharon walks through that door, Sister Betty. When Martha and Anna and David, Jenna, these different ones, my can you imagine if somebody from brother brother Vicel's church walked through those doors from his family, I should say, we wouldn't know what to do. Somebody's got to fall first. Victory comes with a humbling, a laying down of self. Amen. We let go of that attachment. Image is the big enemy. Image is the big enemy. You know why we don't repent? Because we've kept it on so long that we're perfect. You know why we don't share things honestly with people? Because we're too attached to what they think about us. Tell you what, you be honest with a brother or sister one time, they'll think more of you than they ever thought of you before. Paul said, "Confess your faults one to another." You know why that we do that? keeps us humble, keeps it real. You know why I share my struggles and the things that God's had to do with me over this pulpit? So that you know, you can come tell me anything and I'm not going to judge you for it. I've had people tell me some pretty awful things. And you know what? It matters not to me. Tell you what, I've dealt with most of them. Not all of them, but most of them. That's why I do it. Because if I can be honest before you, you know, you can certainly be honest before God. And we ought to be able to be honest with one another. Amen. We die out and we trust that the God who starts the work will finish it. Remember what brother says. Scripture says it. Everywhere that the soul of your foot shall tread, it belongs to you. Brother said, "Footsteps is possession." What was the first place that their foot crossed when they went into Canaan? Jordan. Death. dying out. They had to die out before they could overcome. What did they do? They went and it was a it was a type of baptism. It was a type of dying out. They went, they died out and then they rose. They came up and what did they do? They sanctified themselves a new. They circumcised themselves. Remember? And then only after that could they go in and take over Jericho. Amen. That's the first step. Dying out. The first step of victory you can take is to die out. That's why we baptize you. Your baptism isn't a dying out. It's a symbol of what's supposed to have happened internally. That you have died out. And when you come up, it's a sign that you've risen a new in Christ. And you no longer exist. And it's Christ that's living through you now. It's Christ that's got the victory. And there's a price to pay in that. Is there a price to pay? There's a price to pay. Absolutely there is. It's not easy to die out. It can be humiliating. It can be humbling. It can hurt. It's certainly tough on the ego. Brutal on the pride. Pride and and humility cannot exist simultaneously. They're contrary to one another. Amen. And sometimes the reason we're not winning is we don't want to pay that price. We're so stuck on I'm going to make it happen. I can do it. I can stand. If you're very heavily disciplined, you have a lot of natural strength. That's the reason we don't overcome is because we think we've got enough to make it through. We don't. That's why we need Christ. Amen. But the thing is, what happens? You say, "I can knock down the next domino." Can you knock down the Empire State Building? Because that's what you have to knock down. Death is the final victory. Anybody here think they can knock over death? Brother Grant's wanting to say yes. I can run through a troop and leap over a wall. When I get there, I'll be ready. Amen. But for now, what matters is what stands in front of me. And if I think I can do it on my own, you know what God does? He just lets them get bigger and bigger and bigger until I finally say, "I can't make that one fall. It's too much." Then I start to say, "Is there somebody here that can knock this thing over?" And what does he say? Let me start with you, son. Let me take you down a peg. Let me lay you down. Let me use you so that you can get the victory. He's got to have victory in us before he can get victory in front of us. That's what he's trying to do. This is the scripture we started with. And as we close this morning, then said Jesus unto his disciples, "If any man will come after me, let him deny who?" Himself and take up his cross. You got to crucify the flesh daily. Take up his cross and follow me. Deny who? Satan. I told Satan to get behind. We sing that song, Victory is mine. I told Satan to get behind. You know what we need to do? I told myself, get behind. That's really what we're talking about. It's not the world and Satan we need to worry about. It's self. It's self that gets in the way. Amen. The overcoming position, the starting position is deny yourself. Let Christ have full control of your life. And then when you die out, he can live through you and do things that you could never do before. Give you victories you could never have before. Amen. We want so many victories and we resist the one that he wants, which is victory over you. That's the great victory that he wants. That first enemy we've got to defeat is the toughest one because he likes to bounce up. She likes to bounce up every day. The flesh has to be changed. But we have a daily victory we're supposed to be getting over it. Amen. Itself, it's pride attached to it. And I'll tell you this, it doesn't want to go through that processing that that refining process that God puts us through. It hates it. That's the price we have to pay. I'm going to close with these three quotes. He's talking about Samson. He says, "They're not willing to pay the price." Samson prayed, right? What did he pray? Lord, let me die with the enemy. He says, "That's the trouble. They don't want to pay the price of dying. You've got your own self worked up into a community, into a bunch of people that you associate with and play cards, stay home, watch programs, eat chips, and drink Cokes." He's not talking about you, Sister Mory. The church sits empty. That's why I can say that the church is not empty. She's here. Chips and Cokes are her her kryptonite. If any of you know Sister Moren, the church sits empty. That's right. He says, "Make you sign a card and you'll come six months out of the year to Sunday school." What? Churchity membership. He says, "Such man-made enthusiasm. What you need is the Holy Ghost. That's what dying out really does, church. It brings the Holy Ghost on the scene. He says, "Oh, you say I got it." He says, "You sure don't act like it." Yes, sir. Let the preacher preach an hour or something or something or another like that, you're ready to call the trustee board and throw him out. Praise the Lord. Not in this church. It would have happened a long time ago, wouldn't it, Brother Gerald? Amen. I don't think I can count on one hand the number of times Brother Giller preached under an hour. And if if it was, it was because he felt the spirit wasn't moving. Some of the most glorious services for the young people. Just get us out. But he's sure changed us, hasn't he, brothers and sisters? Now we can't get enough. That's what the Holy Ghost will do. He says that's right. Oh, you want to eat your cake and keep it, too. Isn't that the truth, church? We want to have everything our way plus everything his way. We want to do everything our way and get all of his blessings. That's having your cake and eating it, too. He says, "Can't do that." You know, they have in the in industrial environments, they have that that siren that goes off and it's meant to get your attention. That's what Brother Brad's doing here. You want to eat your cake and keep it too? Can't have it. He says, "No, sir. You've got to surrender yourself. You've got a price to pay. You've got a cleaning up to do. He says, "And I'll tell you, the whole church world needs a cleaning all the way from the pulpit to the janitor's room." That's right. He says, "It's the truth." Not willing to pay. But Samson prayed right when he said, "Lord, let me die with these Philistines." He had failed, but he said, "Let me die." He said, "You must be ready to die to the enemy that's got the victory over you. You must be willing to surrender your own ideas. He said Samson was willing to to pay the price to get the power of God again. What's got our victory so many times? This thing, this mind. That's where we think the victory is. We've got our way set up of how this is going to play out. And God laughs. and he just sits back and he says,"All right, go ahead. Do it. See where it gets you." And all it does is get us brokenness and frustration and annoyance and hurt and separation and despair and humility if you're a child of God. And then we comely crawling back. Lord, I'm really sorry I did it again. Can we do it your way now? Can we do it your way now? What was Samson's problem? Sam Samson's problem was he thought he could do anything he wanted to do and the spirit of God would always come on the scene. But you know what? He was under a covenant that required him to do something. Keep his hair from being cut. And for the sake of personal and fleshly satisfaction, he let his hair get cut. Did you ever notice what led him to do it? Frustration. He got so annoyed with Delilah's constant badgery. That's what our own way does, church. Gets us frustrated. You know, usually we're most frustrated with this guy. We're frustrated. We're frustrated. And it's just our own thinking. It's just our own way that we've drawn things so much and we've wound a net so tight of our own way and our own thinking and our own plan and our own timeline that when it doesn't go that way, we're just a bundle of frustration. Let go. Let go. Samson presumed that his way was God's way and it wasn't. And he lost out. And what happened was he awoke and he says, "I will go out as I have every other time." And you know what happened? He didn't. He went out, but not the way he always went out. The spirit of God was not there. He'd broken his covenant. And so they took him, they put his eyes out, they put him on a gr on a on a mill to to grind the wheat and whatnot. But what they forgot was where his power was, his covenant was. And in those years of grinding that mill, his hair grew back. And when they finally brought him out, Samson said, 'Lord, give me one more victory. Give me one more victory. And he had strength and he pulled down that temple. And I think there was over 3,000 Philistines killed that day. His final victory was his greatest victory. But he sacrificed with them. But remember church, he's under a conditional covenant. Let me tell you tonight, today, I haven't preached that long. You're under an unconditional covenant. You can't lose. You can lose temporarily. Hey, you can lose temporarily, but there's always victory ahead. You just got to come back and lay yourself down. Come back. Lay yourself down. That's it. That's all God's looking for. God honors his word. And when you come back and say, "Lord, I'm willing to do it your way. I'm willing to take your template instead of mine. That's when he can honor it. Amen. We've got to say, Lord, I'm willing to die. I'm willing to lay down. Parents, isn't that what we do? We lay ourselves down for each other. We lay ourselves down for our kids. We sacrifice. God's just asking us to do the same thing for him. Lay yourself down and let me do something through you. Amen. When God places you, when God moves you, that's when the dominoes start to fall. And that thing you've been staring at for years, that's it. In a moment, gone. That's the way God works. Amen. Let's stand together if we would. The first enemy, the first showdown is between you and God. And I'll tell you this, church, he never stops refining. He never stops working. He never stops looking in those doors of our life, of our house. And he's constantly trying to get us, lay yourself down. And what does it become a battle of? My will or God's will? My way, God's way. My life, eternal life, personal strength, total power, defeat, victory. That's all he's asking us. Make a choice. Choose you this day. Amen. And that's what it is every single day. It's a choice of victory or self. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, I can only say this this morning by grace, Lord. How much we need you, Lord. When we look at the darkness that surrounds us, when we look at the onslaught of the enemy, Lord, we need you more than we've ever needed you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Every single person in this congregation needs you in a greater way, Lord. Lord, and we know that Satan's trying to raise up ourselves. He's trying to raise up our pride. He's trying to get us to hold on to image, Lord. And you're asking us to humble ourselves before your word, before each other, Lord, so that you can pick up this piece and use it for great victory. Lord, you see our needs. Lord, you see that Empire State Building, that 443 meters of power that stands before us, of might, of immovability. Lord, you see souls that don't seem to want to be saved. You see diseases that don't seem to want to be moved. You see situations that don't seem to want to be changed. But Lord, we're standing here in faith. Lord, we're standing here in humility by your grace and we're saying, Lord, we're giving ourselves to you, Lord, that you would use us, Lord, that you would overcome us, Lord. That through us, you could overcome these situations we face, Lord. Then in the meantime, Lord, that your grace will be sufficient every single day, Lord, let us not resist, Lord, but let us lay ourselves willingly into your hands. We pray, Lord, bless this special people, we ask, Lord, we've had a showdown this morning. Now we're going into a second showdown, Lord, where we approach the emblems of your shed blood and your broken body, Lord. And we know there's healing, there's deliverance, there's peace, there's joy, Lord. Every redemptive blessing, Lord, is here today by your word and by your presence, Lord. We're here to claim them for ourselves and for each other, Lord. But let us die out this morning. Lord, let us repent. Let us humble ourselves, we pray, Lord, bless your people now, we ask. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. I found it all. 1182. I found it all when I [singing] lost everything [music] and gave my life to serve [singing] a risen king.
