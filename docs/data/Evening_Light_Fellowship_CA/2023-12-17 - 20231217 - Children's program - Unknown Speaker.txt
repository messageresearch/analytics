wonderful you're so wonderful wonderful more than Wonder [Music] [Music] [Applause] wonderful for [Music] for the youth present a shadow play based on the excerpt from the message on the wings of a snow white dove preached by William brandham on November 28th 1965 and John being a prophet knowing the word had to be fulfilled he suffered that and baptized him and when he was raised up out of the water there came the message from Heaven on the wings of a dove this is my beloved Son he sent the redemp Redemption message of Grace on the wings of a dove come flying down out of the heavens peace on Earth and Good Will toward men the sacrifice was ready right then been raised fed his ministry was ready a word that would redeem the whole world it's over now the dove is used in the Bible as a symbol of peace and also it's used by Nations as a symbol of peace we have Nations like our nation is represented by an eag and there's other birds in other nations Rome has an eagle Germany has an eagle many of them great birds of the sky but in all of them the dove symbolizes peace in all nations it's a universal thing just like brother green said one night brother perig green said the symbol of surrender is raise your hands Any Nation raise up your hands it surrender he said when you sing raise your hands you surrender it all and the dove is the symbol of peace in every nation why is it done because of its gentleness and because of its innocence that's the reason it symbols peace another thing about the dove it is a home loving bird it loves to stay at home and another thing it is it's always loyal to its mate the dove male or female never leave one another that female finds her mate in Mating Season see that's complimentary to God's Great creation she's got a great responsibility the dove is always loyal to his mate always never leaves her and may I stop here just for a minute to say this a true bride a female dove is loyal to her mates too it won't inject any dogmas and any denominational doctrines anything of the world it'll stay loyal to its mate the word always loyal and by this home loving conduct by the conduct of it home loving it's been successfully used for a carrier pigeon because it loves home you turn it loose anywhere it'll always go back home it'll go back home we'd like to stress on that a little while and you Christians would understand what I mean it's always finds its way back home so therefore it's been used for carrier pigeon it's used in time of War used to be they still use the carrier pigeons to carry a message so you see then that makes a dove both by God and man a messenger a dove is a messenger it's a message of not to Noah to tell Noah that there's peace again it was used by God to vindicate that this was his son the sacrifice to bring peace upon the Earth and Good Will to men it was used as a messenger right here I have a little story in my mind I read one time out of a book and now I don't want to say what this for sure it may be the decline of the first world war I'm not positive of that now if you miss seeing it then I'm wrong I either read it in a book it's been many years ago but it was certainly a really dramatic thing that happened the American soldiers are pinned down by German machine gun fire and they were in kind of a pit You Soldiers I guess you understand how they were on a reconnaissance somewhere and they was pinned down and they had just a little bit of ammunition left and the Germans was moving in great units moving in everywhere and they know that unless they'd get some reinforcement some help that they would soon all die they had to the Germans coming right down off the mountains looking right down their neck coming right into them like that and one of them happened to remember that he had a little mascot a little pigeon so he knew that this pigeon if it could get up out there would carry the message to the main headquarters to where they were they'd been stationed and so they sat down and wrote on a note we are pinned down in a certain position at a certain area we're out of ammunition and in a few hours we'll have to surrender or other or either we'll be massacred and they pinned this or tied it to the foot of this little Dove and turned him loose now he's a home loving bird so he what does he do he takes back home to find his mate she was worried about him he'd have to come back home and as he went up the Germans seen what had happened so the thing they' done they started shooting at the Dove and one of them hit him with a 30 caliber machine gun bullet and broke his leg another one tore big honk out of his back his chest was bruised all the way across one of his wings was crippled the end shot of half of it and he flew sideways but he kept climbing and finally he made it crippled wounded broken bruised but he fell in the camp with the message that was a great Dove but oh brother Isaiah 53 tells us of one came down from home and all that was good and he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed sickness Superstition and Devils had us pinned down there was no way out the church had gone wrong they had went off on denominational things and the Pharisees and the Sadducees and washing of pots and pans and the word of God became of no effect but this little Dove came down and there's only one thing that could tell take place there had to be a redeemer but being wounded broken beaten torn but he knowed his way back home so from calvary's Cross where they bruised him mashed him tore him like a bunch of wolves upon him he made his flight from Calvary and he landed in Heaven's Door saying it's finished it's finished they are free sickness can be healed now Sinners can be saved the captive can be set free though he was bruised and wounded that great battle there when everything against him even the poet cried mid mid rendering rocks and darkening disguise My Savior bowed his head and died but the opening Veil revealed the way to a Heaven's joy and endless day amen amen Why Don't We Stand and as they're just moving back there we'll sing hark the herald angel sings 481 up there amen a lot of coordinating going on there that was uh that was really well done God bless all the all those that had

story introduction at the beginning of time when God promised to put em enity between the woman's seed and the Serpent's Seed the Fallen World longed for a redeemer a savior as the years passed God confirmed his promise to Abraham Isaac Jacob Judah and each successive generation he also spoke to David through Nathan the prophet saying when your days are over and you rest with your ancestors I will raise up your Offspring to succeed you your own flesh and blood and I will establish his kingdom he is the one who will build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever as the years passed God spoke through His prophets and encouraged his people again and again for example he spoke through Isaiah say for to us a child is born to us a son of is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called the wonderful counselor and the Mighty God and the Everlasting father and the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of host will perform them in that day the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples the Nations will Valley to him and his resting place will be glorious after Isaiah's prophecies the years continued to pass one by one for 400 years almost forgotten the time finally came for the promises to be fulfilled each would unravel in mystery and simplicity the broken world would witness a glory so wonderful yet so humble it would almost seem hidden if it were not for Faith by these scriptures being fulfilled a way into light and life would be opened through great sacrifice and undeserved Grace welcoming whosoever will into it this is the beginning of God's promise to redeem his children Jesus Christ's birth [Music] 166 Oh Come will come Emmanuel let just wait for there it is okay Oh Come Oh Come

sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are th among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast sister in mind what man manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her beh Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said said Mary unto the angel how should this be seeing that I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also th hoest thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin El Elizabeth shall she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the six month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from [Music] her [Music] [Music] [Music] right Mary did you know that your baby boy would one day walk on water Mary did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters did you know that your baby boy has come to make you [Music] new and this child that you've [Music] delivered will soon deliver you Mary Did You you know that your baby boy wouldn't give sight to a blind man Mary did you know that your baby boy would come a storm with his hand did you know that that your baby boy has walked Where Angels TR when you kiss your little baby you've kissed the face of God the blind will see the de will will hear the dead will live again the lame will leap the Dum will speak the Praises of the [Music] lamb Mary did you know that your B baby boy is Lord of all creation Mary did you know that your baby boy would one day rule the Nations did you know that your baby boy is Heaven's perfect lamb and this sleeping CH you're holding is The Great I [Music] Am [Music] [Music] and Mary arose in those days and went into the Hill Country with haste into a city of Judah and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth it came to pass that when Elizabeth had heard the salutation of Mary The Babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb L this is to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me for for L as soon as I voice of solitation sounding in my ears The Babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believeth for thou shal be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord and Mary said my soul doth magnify the Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior for he hath regarded the love state of his handmaiden for behold from hence forth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his Mercy is in is on them that fear Him from generation to generation he has shown strength in his arm and has scattered the proud in the indignation of their hearts for he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree for he has filled the Hungry with good things and the rich he has sent empty away he has helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his Mercy as he spake to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed forever and Mary Abode with her about 3 months and returned to her own [Music] house [Music] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as's mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her public example was minded to put her away PIV priv but while he saw on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call him his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interrupted interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bitten him had bitten him and took unto his wife and now her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name [Music] Jesus [Music] number 483 it's so little town of Bethlehem how still

cenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of nazare unto Judea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she

manger and when they had seen it they made they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all that they heard it wondered at those things which were told to them by

the circumcising of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as it is written in the law of the Lord every meale that openeth the womb Shall be Called holy of the Lord and offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of T does or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same was a just and devout man waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and when he came by the spirit into the temple when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now letest thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou Hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother mared at these at those things were just spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto his mother Mary's mother behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yay a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was one Anna a propheus the daughter of punu of the tribe of Asher she was of a great age and had lived with a husband 7 years from from her virginity and she was a widow of about 4 score and 4 years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and when she coming in that instant gave things likewise unto the Lord and spake of him to all that looks for redemption in Jerusalem and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord they returned into Galilee into the Ron City Nazareth [Music] e [Music] [Music] and now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea and in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his ear in the East and are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he is troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where should the Christ be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor and that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star had appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and [Music] said go in search diligent leave for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and though the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were com into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him when they had opened their Treasures they presented Ed unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrr and being warned of God a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way and when they had departed behold the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying arise and take thee in child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek thee and child to destroy him when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt and there and was there until the death of Herod that might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my [Music] son [Music] then Herod when he saw that he is mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and all the coasts thereof from two two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men then was fulfilled that which was spoken spoken by Jeremiah the

not withstanding being warned of God at a dream he turned aside into parts of Galilee and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he

great Creator became my savior and all God's forness dwelling in [Music] John amen you can have your seats if you will just a moment amen I certainly enjoyed that amen a lot of hard work a lot of effort went into that and we certainly appreciate sister Priscilla doing that and those that have come behind and helped I know she's not the one that built that and she's not the one that's sang All the specials but she was certainly the the driving force behind it so we want to thank her especially uh for for the hard work that she put in there and each one that willingly came and helped out it doesn't happen without the sound and the video working together and the musicians and sister Morin having to figure out 18 songs that we sing once a year you know so very thankful for that amen but as just before service started I was reading in Luke and they read it in in in in the program here this morning and it was remember when the the angel came to Mary and she says how is this going to happen you know and I think we've got to be able to bring what's what's happened there into what's happening today and we say how does this happen and the angels answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee it's the only way the word can be produced it's the same birth he was the first of many Brethren amen his birth has to be the same as our birth his way has to be our way it has to be a supernatural thing it has to be a thing that comes from God the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son Of God scripture says he was the firstborn among many Brethren it wasn't just he was the son of God but there were other sons of God there were other daughters of God that were coming behind and the holy thing that comes out of our life is not of us but it's the highest the the one the the the holy thing that's coming out of us is because the highest has overshadowed us because the Holy Spirit has been made alive inside of us but I want you to notice that it wasn't just Mary that was having a special birth because he said and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived a son in her old age and this is the six month with her who is called Barren for with God nothing shall be impossible you'll find that a birth is surrounded by the Supernatural and it's not just me but it's you and it's you and it's you and it's a great thing that's going on and it's the moving of God to produce his word and its season amen and Mary said this behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word you know and she goes and she meets up with Elizabeth and Elizabeth starts to talk to her and as soon as she hears the name we know that the baby John the Baptist in her womb comes to life or he he moves for the first time amen and Mary says and when is this to me or Elizabeth says whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the Babe leaped in my womb for Joy the very presence the very thought not even manifested yet but the very inspiration the very start of that word was enough to bring life before he was born Christ was already performing Miracles what the presence of the Holy Ghost the fullness of God in somebody else and watch what she says she says blessed is she that believed you're blessed because you believe that's the only thing you can bring to the table Lord I believe she he says for there shall be a performance of those things which were told unto her from the Lord we've had a seventh angel come and he's told us what's going to happen and he's told us what God has promised us and he's pointed us to the word and he says the word has to come not just as it was 2,000 years ago but it has to come in flesh today and it's born in brothers and sisters and Sons and Daughters of God and it has to come because the highest overshadows them and the Holy Spirit comes to rest inside of them and it produces a life that they can't live for and all we can say is we believed and then we believed and there's a performance then of the things that he promised us that he would do and as we come into this new year I say let's believe that he's going to do what he said he was going to do the only one thing left for the bride and that's a Rapture and a resurrection that's the only thing we're looking for amen so let's believe that amen this morning let's stand if we would and sister morning if you can come back to the piano the musicians and let's just sing that song be it unto me according to Thy word amen and then we'll go out and we'll have a fellowship and there's food and we've got some gifts for the different ones that have supported the church this year and whatnot so if you can stay around and whether you're a visitor where you're here all the time we welcome each one there's plenty there for us to sit and and have some fellowship amen let's just sing this be it unto me according to your word word according to your prises I can stand secure right upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word oh Lord be it unto me be it un to me according to your word according to your promises I can stand secure and right upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word oh Lord be it un sing it one more time be it unto me according to your word according to your promises I can stand [Music] secure right upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word oh Lord be it un to me amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're thankful you came Lord we're thankful that you Lord without reluctance stepped into your word position Lord as a lamb as a dove you laid down your life without complaint Lord without fear Lord but you rested on the very word that produced you but Lord we're glad you didn't just die we're glad you resurrected Lord because because that means there's a resurrection for us as well Lord that are born of the spirit into that body Lord that the same spirit that dwells in you dwells in US Lord and it quickens us and it makes us live the word and it makes us hear the word and it makes us produce the word Lord in a way we couldn't otherwise Lord and it's producing Christ again 2,000 years later Lord and it's the same life it's the same mind it's the same intentions it's the same desires it's the same motives and objectives and Lord we're praying Lord that even as we go through this Christmas season season Lord with all of its glitter and glamour Lord and gifts and food and all these things Lord may we just remember Lord how simple and humble it was Lord you came in an animal's burn Lord you're born in a manger Lord where they laid food Lord you weren't surrounded by great things Lord but you surrounded by Humble people Lord that would listen to an angel's voice and come and worship Lord and we've come to worship you today we've come to worship you not just in this season Lord but help us to worship Lord by the the life that we live every day Lord help us to draw closer to you in this time lord may we just look for you to do perform those things which you promised Lord not just in our brothers and sisters but in my life Lord in each and every one of us Lord may we look to ourselves and say Lord we're expecting you Lord we're trusting you Lord we're receiving you in a greater way this year Lord would you just bless us now Lord as we go to eat the food Lord may you bless it to our bod's

presence just be amongst us we ask now in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you [Music] e
