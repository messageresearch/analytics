[46:32] to your word in all things we ask
[46:34] in jesus name amen amen lord bless you
[46:37] all
[46:39] as we come into his presence once more
[46:41] we're so glad let's turn in our
[46:43] scriptures
[46:46] to uh john
[46:47] 3
[46:50] verse 3.
[46:52] welcome you all here to this morning and
[46:55] thankful for
[46:58] song service and bringing this
[47:01] to the place
[47:02] that we need to for the word
[47:04] as we come forward and like i said this
[47:05] is going to be just a sunday school
[47:07] lesson so
[47:11] so let's read here uh
[47:13] john
[47:14] three
[47:15] and then i'll begin talking about being
[47:17] born again
[47:18] and uh
[47:20] this is uh the main scripture here for
[47:22] that and
[47:23] we know it is the first thing that jesus
[47:25] taught when he naked nicodemus visited
[47:28] him
[47:29] so we
[47:31] want to just
[47:32] rehearse these scriptures as we go into
[47:34] the word
[47:36] and that we all settle into this
[47:44] john 3
[47:45] 3 jesus answered and said unto him
[47:47] verily verily
[47:49] i say unto thee
[47:51] except a man be born again
[47:53] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[47:56] so you don't see the kingdom of god
[47:57] unless you have a new birth
[48:00] and you don't see the kingdom of god
[48:03] so unless you have a new birth
[48:06] because you don't you you don't see
[48:08] anything you don't see the motions or
[48:10] the actions or the activities that we
[48:13] have of a new birth
[48:15] without that and the moving of the
[48:17] kingdom of god we're blind to it and
[48:19] these things are hidden from the natural
[48:21] man
[48:22] right so unless we see these things
[48:24] that's why the world goes around the way
[48:25] they do because they do not see
[48:27] those things that spiritual
[48:29] activity that goes on that god is hidden
[48:33] from the world from the wise
[48:36] and now is
[48:37] it being revealed
[48:39] through that experience that born-again
[48:40] experience i just want to quote here uh
[48:43] first corinthians 2 14 you don't have to
[48:45] turn
[48:46] but it says but the natural man
[48:47] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[48:50] of god
[48:51] for they are foolishness unto him
[48:54] neither can we know them
[48:55] because they are spiritually
[48:58] discerned amen they're spiritually
[49:00] discerned
[49:01] so verse 4
[49:02] nicodemus saith unto him how can a man
[49:05] be born when he is old can he enter the
[49:08] second time into his mother's womb and
[49:10] be born
[49:11] jesus answered verily verily
[49:13] i say unto thee except a man
[49:17] may be born of water and spirit and the
[49:20] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[49:23] of god so it takes a new birth
[49:25] to see or to comprehend or to understand
[49:27] what god is doing in this kingdom
[49:29] without it you'll never enter into it
[49:32] it's a necessity
[49:34] verse 6 that which is born of the flesh
[49:37] is flesh
[49:38] and that's what that which is born of
[49:40] the spirit is fair is spirit
[49:43] so
[49:44] that's such an important thing because
[49:45] there's two births there's one bite of
[49:47] flesh
[49:48] and there's one by the spirit and it
[49:51] came because of the fall
[49:54] and we'll get into that
[49:56] more later
[49:58] so there are two birds one of the flesh
[50:00] and
[50:01] one by the spirit amen you may be seated
[50:03] maybe
[50:04] god had its blessing to the reading of
[50:06] his word
[50:08] so i'll go into this topic here
[50:11] about being born again and
[50:14] it's really just started as a sunday
[50:16] school thing when the sunday school was
[50:17] out there i filled in for paul one time
[50:20] and
[50:20] when i went in and
[50:22] sat down that's all i came to my mind
[50:24] was being born again that topic you know
[50:27] that was just
[50:28] uh all i could speak to there and then
[50:31] we had a another session
[50:33] i filled in for paula again another
[50:34] session and we went more into being born
[50:37] again
[50:38] so uh some of the slides here at the
[50:41] beginning it's just
[50:42] a little background of what we talked
[50:44] about at that point so some people here
[50:46] would would see those things and uh
[50:48] it would be new to others i hope
[50:51] i hope i didn't show it again but i've
[50:54] done that before
[50:55] so we just want to
[50:57] just give a little bit of background
[50:59] first and we'll as we go into that
[51:04] and i hope we all get something out of
[51:05] it here today
[51:10] and i don't get
[51:12] too thirsty
[51:14] amen
[51:18] so just going back
[51:19] into the beginning in genesis 1 1 and it
[51:22] says in the beginning
[51:24] god created the heavens and the earth
[51:27] now we know and we just had a little bit
[51:28] of discussion about this last time when
[51:30] we were in the sunday school just to
[51:31] explain
[51:32] that the in genesis 1 1 the earth wasn't
[51:36] like completely new created
[51:38] and we know that there was there was a
[51:41] earth
[51:42] and brother branham alludes to it he
[51:43] didn't go into it a whole lot but he
[51:44] does explain that there was a
[51:46] civilization before
[51:48] and it was destroyed and it could have
[51:50] happened many many many trillions of
[51:52] years ago we don't know he doesn't go
[51:54] into it because he because
[51:57] in terms of
[51:58] uh this earth
[52:00] today and this what god revealed here it
[52:04] just pertained to this time these 6 000
[52:07] years but before that there was and the
[52:09] words that were used here in terms of
[52:11] create in the hebrew if they go into the
[52:14] hebrew it wasn't like created new
[52:17] it was just formed yeah it was just
[52:19] formed and brown goes into that in a
[52:21] number of quotes and we had to go into
[52:23] that a bit into the sunday school just
[52:26] to explain those things
[52:28] because it was kind of new to them
[52:30] but that's what happened so
[52:32] so there was a
[52:34] a previous
[52:35] uh creation of just
[52:38] there was some kind of previous creation
[52:41] or civilization
[52:42] and then the earth was cursed everything
[52:44] was wiped off so it probably explains
[52:46] dinosaurs all those things the city and
[52:48] the things they find that are very old
[52:50] that was in the earth because it was
[52:52] just reformed but in in that in that
[52:55] period of genesis 1 1
[52:57] it was covered by a mist it was dark and
[53:00] even though that there was things in
[53:01] there that could grow they couldn't grow
[53:03] because the sun couldn't reach it
[53:04] because of that mist that was over
[53:06] and here i have is a darkness or a mist
[53:10] so then and then the sun was already
[53:12] created in genesis 1 and the mist was
[53:14] over
[53:16] and in genesis 2 the earth was without
[53:17] form and void and darkness was upon the
[53:20] face of the deep
[53:23] so
[53:24] so that was the existence that
[53:26] started as we know when god you know
[53:29] like
[53:30] started to
[53:31] express his word in that period and
[53:33] that's what the earth looked like and
[53:35] that's what we believe
[53:38] and and in here
[53:40] what happened then
[53:41] is that
[53:42] that god said let there be light so he
[53:45] took away that darkness and then the sun
[53:47] reached the earth and those those things
[53:49] started to grow
[53:51] and then it brings forth what was in
[53:53] that earth that was planted in that
[53:55] earth and very much
[53:57] is that brotherhood said that that
[53:59] type's also the human soul
[54:01] right so that when we we because of the
[54:03] fall when we came into existence
[54:06] there was a darkness upon us
[54:10] so we we see here
[54:12] that it that
[54:14] the man themselves also
[54:17] mirrored the earth in the same way it
[54:19] was
[54:20] it was produced
[54:21] and what happened in the beginning
[54:23] after the fall
[54:26] we read john 6 here and whatever that
[54:28] inner being is that there's an image of
[54:30] god we're going to call that the seed
[54:33] and it was overshadowed by the worldly
[54:35] nature of genesis 2. so this darkness
[54:39] that was over the earth
[54:41] was really the what same darkness over
[54:44] us as it was explained in ephesians 2
[54:47] and it says where in times past ye
[54:48] walked according to the course of the
[54:51] world because of the birth that soul is
[54:53] overshadowed by the prince of the power
[54:56] of the ear
[54:57] the spirit that now worketh in the
[54:59] children of disobedience
[55:01] so that's the darkness that was upon us
[55:03] where we couldn't see there was nothing
[55:05] could grow that seed that was there
[55:07] could not
[55:09] germinate because of the darkness
[55:10] because the word could not reach it
[55:13] right and that's what happens to
[55:15] everyone
[55:20] and
[55:21] that seed
[55:23] you know we look at it we call it the
[55:25] soul
[55:25] the seed
[55:27] it's the word right it's it's it's the
[55:29] word of god that's in you
[55:31] it's a germ it's a the lowest form of of
[55:35] life that's in that soul is the word of
[55:37] god
[55:38] and that's what gets quickened because
[55:40] that's the part of god that's in us is
[55:42] that seed
[55:43] the rest of it is all was kind of came
[55:45] to our natural birth but that one one
[55:48] piece in there that soul
[55:50] when that word of that light hits that
[55:53] germ seed the word of god
[55:56] it quickens right and it comes to life
[55:58] and that's what happens so that that
[56:00] darkness then moves out of the way
[56:03] just like it did with the earth
[56:05] and then the word can reach it that's
[56:07] the principle
[56:08] but abraham taught
[56:10] so here in quote in the law of grace the
[56:13] first man
[56:14] went away under the law
[56:16] under animal's blood it couldn't change
[56:18] his heart
[56:20] because a animal life won't compare with
[56:23] human life trying to go slow
[56:26] so
[56:26] here under the law they used animals
[56:28] blood but didn't have the the life in it
[56:32] that would
[56:33] that would cleanse away the sin it would
[56:35] only do it for a year when they did a
[56:37] sacrifice in jewish days
[56:39] so the animal can't give the
[56:41] human blood the animal can't do it
[56:43] because his life is a different life and
[56:46] an animal
[56:47] has a life but not a soul
[56:50] an animal is a living being but not a
[56:53] soul there's nothing of a germ seed of
[56:55] god in there right
[56:56] so that soul being that seed that word
[57:00] an animal is a living being but not a
[57:02] soul
[57:03] but god puts soul on man
[57:06] so then my so then my soul what is the
[57:10] soul the nature of the spirit so he
[57:13] explained it so what is the soul is the
[57:15] nature of the spirit and the problem is
[57:17] that nature that's of my spirit
[57:20] and that's what you go through
[57:23] you're born with you go through life and
[57:26] then that's what comes to face to face
[57:28] when that word is quickened and what you
[57:29] have to deal with
[57:31] so what has to change the nature has to
[57:33] change your nature right and we know the
[57:36] nature of man and the nature of god is
[57:38] two different things
[57:40] and the spirit the spirit controls
[57:43] the soul
[57:44] controls the spirit and the spirit
[57:45] controls the body
[57:47] so here we are again
[57:49] in this setup so we see this the soul
[57:52] part and this
[57:54] so what happens was when the light here
[57:56] when the sun went through to the earth
[57:58] here and and generated that seed that
[58:02] that was planted in the earth from that
[58:04] god put there from the first first
[58:07] civilization now starts to come forth so
[58:09] all the trees and everything you read it
[58:11] in genesis 1 it all starts to come forth
[58:13] once that sun starts to hit the earth
[58:16] simple simple basics
[58:18] so then with man
[58:20] once also that that darkness is taken
[58:24] away and the word of god hits that soul
[58:27] then you see that new nature in that
[58:30] that gold part there
[58:32] and then but you're still dealing with
[58:34] the old nature right
[58:36] so
[58:37] you know it's still on on your flesh
[58:40] that fleshly part you'll always have
[58:42] that with you you'll always have that
[58:44] element of that in your that you'll deal
[58:46] with as long as you're in this body
[58:48] you'll always be fighting that spirit
[58:49] it's just the with the word you just
[58:52] you just come to a place where you bring
[58:54] it under subjection you bring it under
[58:56] control
[58:59] so god divides himself and then gathers
[59:01] himself together so really when you look
[59:03] at the plan of god
[59:05] here in the earth you know all all of
[59:07] those like seed is seed is uh sown and
[59:11] then it's it grows and then it's
[59:13] gathered back together and god has the
[59:15] same principle he he he puts out that
[59:18] seed in in in each one of us and then it
[59:21] grows and then he comes back and gets it
[59:23] that's himself
[59:24] he's he's putting himself out there and
[59:26] then he's bringing himself back and
[59:28] that's the basic plan of god right and
[59:30] that's what we go through now is we know
[59:33] we're going back to god we came from god
[59:36] we're going back to god if you weren't
[59:38] in god
[59:39] and he didn't sow that seed in you
[59:42] then you're not going back there
[59:44] a simple fact so it's not about us it's
[59:46] about him what he's doing
[59:48] right so if you're not there in the
[59:50] beginning you won't be there in the end
[59:53] you know that's cold hard facts
[59:57] and that's all come out in the in the in
[59:59] the message
[1:00:00] you know because there's
[1:00:02] you know there's things you could never
[1:00:04] you could never really put it together
[1:00:06] before
[1:00:07] you know in terms of uh
[1:00:09] you know elect and then there was
[1:00:12] foolish virgin and wise virgin and you
[1:00:15] just couldn't put all the scriptures to
[1:00:16] apply to that because there's really
[1:00:18] things that apply to the elect
[1:00:21] because you know it said he chose us you
[1:00:23] know we didn't choose him
[1:00:25] and i know i never choose i chose him i
[1:00:28] had nothing to choose him from
[1:00:31] choose him there was nothing in me to
[1:00:33] choose him i couldn't in my own mind
[1:00:34] even
[1:00:35] recollect that you know just being under
[1:00:38] that nature under that darkness you're
[1:00:40] dead
[1:00:41] so then when you're quickened it's
[1:00:43] already done it was done from the
[1:00:44] foundation you were chosen and now here
[1:00:47] you are and you're quickened and now
[1:00:50] you're just starting to realize you go
[1:00:51] to the altar but that's only just
[1:00:53] formality that's only tradition really
[1:00:56] you're just finding out something that
[1:00:58] you never knew that something's drawn
[1:01:00] you you know and that's what's drawn you
[1:01:02] is that word for your data shining on
[1:01:05] that on that seed right and bring it
[1:01:07] forth
[1:01:08] and that's why you're here today and
[1:01:10] there's what's amazing is only a few
[1:01:13] it's only a few especially in this hour
[1:01:20] he places himself in the earth then
[1:01:22] broods over it to find part of him from
[1:01:24] the beginning so he goes looking for it
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:27] the holy spirit goes goes to find that
[1:01:29] seed right and uh because it's buried in
[1:01:32] there in all these humans and all sort
[1:01:35] of things his seed is here
[1:01:39] and when found then it begins the
[1:01:41] process in them called the new birth
[1:01:43] that's what happened that's what he
[1:01:44] calls the new birth
[1:01:46] so the new birth is really two parts
[1:01:48] it's you're born up by the spirit you're
[1:01:50] quickened that is quickened and then
[1:01:52] you're baptized with the holy spirit
[1:01:54] that's the new birth
[1:01:57] he pulls that which is part of himself
[1:01:59] as we said
[1:02:01] and he's casting a net
[1:02:03] but gets more than fish so he he he
[1:02:07] he's the word is is out there and it's
[1:02:09] cast out just like jesus
[1:02:12] talked about you know and
[1:02:13] as fishers of men and going out and
[1:02:15] pulling in fish but you get everything
[1:02:17] from the sea right so it's a lot of
[1:02:19] things that come in together with it and
[1:02:22] we know that we've seen it in here and
[1:02:24] it comes in here
[1:02:25] and it's it comes in but it never stays
[1:02:29] because god chooses
[1:02:31] what comes in
[1:02:32] and what stays right he does right so
[1:02:35] for for us as christians we're open to
[1:02:38] everything right we're open to
[1:02:40] to we don't know
[1:02:42] you never know you'll never know because
[1:02:44] we don't know the future i don't know
[1:02:46] anybody here is really
[1:02:49] really truly
[1:02:51] you know the seed because we don't know
[1:02:52] the future you don't know what's going
[1:02:54] to happen tomorrow right
[1:02:55] then you never know if he's not right
[1:02:58] you never know and i know it was i think
[1:03:00] like jenkins who said he said uh
[1:03:03] god knows
[1:03:04] god knows who who is and who isn't
[1:03:07] right and he only tells you and he
[1:03:10] doesn't tell anybody else
[1:03:12] so you have to you have to that's why
[1:03:15] you never judge right because you can't
[1:03:17] you know we can't see a head like that
[1:03:19] so
[1:03:20] so you know
[1:03:22] and if you don't know what at the
[1:03:23] beginning you'll eventually know
[1:03:25] sometimes it takes a long time
[1:03:27] you know before you understand that you
[1:03:30] were but it's just a little slow turn
[1:03:33] and then you kind of see it but it's a
[1:03:35] lifetime process we know because as we
[1:03:38] said that old nature is there still like
[1:03:41] putting out but it has no power
[1:03:43] it has no power right because once
[1:03:45] calvary was finished the planet
[1:03:48] redemption was finished
[1:03:50] and satan had no power which means that
[1:03:52] he can't
[1:03:53] come and
[1:03:54] condemn you he can condemn you he'd give
[1:03:56] you all kinds of condemnation but he
[1:03:57] can't go to god and say he did this
[1:03:59] there's no good he has no power he has
[1:04:01] no power anymore
[1:04:03] it it means nothing to god god said what
[1:04:05] are you talking about
[1:04:06] right there's nothing there's nothing
[1:04:08] there it's gone let's see
[1:04:09] forgetfulness
[1:04:11] and then once it passes through to see
[1:04:12] it for forgetfulness
[1:04:16] once you go through there it's righteous
[1:04:18] righteousness you have righteousness and
[1:04:20] if god has given you anything he never
[1:04:22] takes it back
[1:04:24] right if he's given you uh the holy
[1:04:25] ghost he'll never take it back
[1:04:27] if he's given you it's just like the
[1:04:29] lutherans they have justification and
[1:04:31] they still have it
[1:04:32] right wesleyans still have
[1:04:33] sanctifications they you know methodists
[1:04:36] all of them all those that came past
[1:04:38] that still have it he will never take it
[1:04:40] away pentecost have what they had at the
[1:04:42] beginning
[1:04:43] they still have it they still have the
[1:04:45] gifts of the spirit you know and they
[1:04:48] but they don't move on right just
[1:04:50] they
[1:04:51] and righteousness
[1:04:53] you know it's like
[1:04:54] if you see where
[1:04:56] abraham
[1:04:57] and uh
[1:04:59] sarah laughed right i said he said sir
[1:05:01] why'd you laugh right
[1:05:03] but then abraham when he said you know
[1:05:04] you're gonna have he laughed but god
[1:05:06] said nothing to him right he was
[1:05:08] righteous
[1:05:11] he's casting a net but gets more than
[1:05:13] fish
[1:05:16] it's preached to all but god doesn't
[1:05:17] pick and choose because of some
[1:05:19] preconceived idea he doesn't right it's
[1:05:22] really he's just going he's looking for
[1:05:24] his own
[1:05:26] he's sweeping the earth looking for it
[1:05:28] and he'll find it he he will not lose
[1:05:30] one
[1:05:32] because he went and
[1:05:34] one
[1:05:35] he had a hundred sheep one one was lost
[1:05:38] and he went and found us
[1:05:40] he won't lose any of them
[1:05:43] you can't because it's god it's a part
[1:05:45] of him that sees part of him and he's
[1:05:47] not going to be incomplete at the end
[1:05:50] you know it's is that's why the last one
[1:05:52] has to be in
[1:05:56] he says this one because that one is his
[1:06:00] the other will never receive the call
[1:06:02] nothing in it to receive the call right
[1:06:05] it just doesn't happen you see it
[1:06:06] yourself and it could be religious as
[1:06:08] anything and you present the word and
[1:06:10] they just walk away but you don't
[1:06:12] condemn him
[1:06:14] up because we don't know up the road he
[1:06:16] could you know remember tim pruitt
[1:06:18] saying there was one person and he was
[1:06:21] he just wrote him off there's no way
[1:06:24] that he could ever be he was such a
[1:06:27] cruel and hard man
[1:06:28] and he got saved
[1:06:32] yeah
[1:06:33] and uh
[1:06:34] but brandon had it with that that man
[1:06:38] bert yeah
[1:06:46] so here uh just quickly over in the mind
[1:06:49] of god here
[1:06:50] and brother brown talked about yard
[1:06:52] goods
[1:06:53] and he talked about
[1:06:55] here
[1:06:56] a pattern and god laid out his his
[1:06:59] material
[1:07:01] and then he takes his pattern and he
[1:07:02] puts it in
[1:07:03] and that that was his elect
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:06] he took that that was that was his
[1:07:09] that would be his bride
[1:07:12] and then there was a remnant and the
[1:07:14] rest of it probably said it folds up and
[1:07:16] puts it away and use it some other time
[1:07:19] and that's
[1:07:20] that doesn't say that it's not
[1:07:22] it's not the
[1:07:23] part of god it's all part of god this is
[1:07:25] in the mind of god it's in the mind of
[1:07:27] god it'll all come back to him
[1:07:29] in the end right
[1:07:31] so just just uh run through this quick
[1:07:33] there for i had this for the sunday
[1:07:35] school here the elect is god's seed or
[1:07:38] as we know is the wise virgin
[1:07:40] and they have the holy ghost they had
[1:07:42] the oil right
[1:07:44] now
[1:07:45] and they have eternal life they went in
[1:07:48] when the in the end they went in they
[1:07:49] had the oil and they went in
[1:07:51] john 5 24. let's put random often quoted
[1:07:54] revelation 3 21 i just won't go into it
[1:07:57] so in the remnant it is god's seed it's
[1:07:59] the fooling foolish virgin
[1:08:01] but they had no holy ghost they had no
[1:08:03] oil
[1:08:04] now
[1:08:05] when you look at that scripture in
[1:08:07] matthew 24 just explain that there
[1:08:09] you know it does talk about have all but
[1:08:12] you know the oil represents the holy
[1:08:14] ghost and if god gives you the holy
[1:08:15] ghost you you cannot he will not take it
[1:08:18] back and it's if you look in 24 it says
[1:08:21] that
[1:08:22] they they they didn't have the holy
[1:08:24] ghost they had it and they lost it and
[1:08:26] that doesn't happen to people but it
[1:08:27] happens to churches
[1:08:29] so in luther's day they had the holy
[1:08:31] ghost they had the oil but after a
[1:08:34] number of generations it went
[1:08:36] so in that case it's a double meaning it
[1:08:38] talks about people but it also talks
[1:08:40] about churches it talks about those
[1:08:42] church ages where they will be given the
[1:08:44] word for their day but they will lose it
[1:08:46] up the road you know a couple of
[1:08:47] generations when ma when it's their
[1:08:51] revelation starts to mix in with the to
[1:08:54] the thoughts of man and the
[1:08:56] the things of god uh things of god is
[1:08:58] not pure anymore then the holy holy
[1:09:00] ghost moves moves from it and you see
[1:09:02] that right in the early church also you
[1:09:05] see it in the early church where paul
[1:09:06] and them are sending out warnings that
[1:09:09] this
[1:09:09] it's going
[1:09:11] it's not going good here you know this
[1:09:13] is starting to fall and it did it fell
[1:09:15] in that first second third age until in
[1:09:17] the fourth age it was almost gone right
[1:09:20] off the earth right in the in the dark
[1:09:22] ages there was hardly any seed there
[1:09:24] left at all you know
[1:09:28] and we know why we know why because you
[1:09:30] know in those seven church ages
[1:09:32] uh you know there was a portion of god
[1:09:34] in those
[1:09:35] in the first age right up on second age
[1:09:39] third age there was just it was the son
[1:09:41] of god period and they had a message for
[1:09:44] their age but it wasn't the whole
[1:09:45] message because it was lost from the
[1:09:47] beginning but then in you know in one
[1:09:50] age you might have justification was the
[1:09:51] message and sanctification wasn't but in
[1:09:54] the justification age they didn't have
[1:09:56] sanctification so they didn't have it
[1:09:57] all
[1:09:58] right it was only a partial
[1:10:00] part of that whole message but in the
[1:10:02] last age we saw it all restored back
[1:10:04] again the way it was in the first stage
[1:10:06] and it had everything right and goddess
[1:10:09] everything so they just had a portion of
[1:10:10] and that was the son of god age it's
[1:10:12] another
[1:10:13] topic altogether
[1:10:16] so no
[1:10:17] no moisture
[1:10:19] there in for the remnant justified
[1:10:21] sanctified clean life they don't go on
[1:10:23] to the holy ghost they have justified
[1:10:25] sanctified they live a holy life but
[1:10:27] they don't go on to the holy ghost so
[1:10:29] they didn't get into the door in matthew
[1:10:31] 24. they went into the tribulation
[1:10:35] and that was the foolish virgin
[1:10:37] and this well taught there
[1:10:40] in the message went through the
[1:10:41] tribulation
[1:10:44] so that was god's remnant from the mind
[1:10:46] of god that was those two categories
[1:10:50] there
[1:10:51] and the unbeliever is the serpent seed
[1:10:55] born a man no seed they don't have
[1:10:57] anything to receive god
[1:10:59] and we'll just talk about that in the
[1:11:00] next slide
[1:11:02] and they go through the tribulation
[1:11:04] so here the elect they go into the
[1:11:06] rapture or the first resurrection
[1:11:09] and the millennium they go through the
[1:11:11] millennium there is no judgment they
[1:11:12] took their judgment
[1:11:14] at calvary they were in christ just like
[1:11:17] eve eve was in adam the bribe was in
[1:11:19] christ
[1:11:20] just like eve came out of the side of of
[1:11:23] adam
[1:11:24] the soldier went up and hit the
[1:11:26] side of jesus with the sword and the
[1:11:29] bride was came out right
[1:11:33] she appeared then in that first stage
[1:11:37] second
[1:11:38] resurrection and they go they will go
[1:11:41] they will go to the second resurrection
[1:11:43] they will go through the judgment they
[1:11:44] will not be there at the tribulation
[1:11:47] then they are granted eternal life
[1:11:50] so after after the first resurrection
[1:11:52] there's there's there's no word
[1:11:56] just you're you're you're based in on on
[1:11:59] works right
[1:12:01] new new heavens and earth they will be
[1:12:03] there outside the city
[1:12:05] because they are
[1:12:06] part of god right but they will not be
[1:12:08] in the city
[1:12:11] and
[1:12:12] and then the unbeliever will go through
[1:12:13] the second resurrection the judgment
[1:12:16] no eternal life the lake of fire
[1:12:19] but there will be some that will come in
[1:12:20] on their works right we know that we see
[1:12:23] that in matthew 25
[1:12:25] because there will be mercy for some
[1:12:27] right who are good to the bride amen
[1:12:30] so god is just
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:32] so that's that's the view of election
[1:12:36] so blessed
[1:12:37] be the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:12:40] christ
[1:12:41] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:12:43] blessings in heavenly voice
[1:12:46] according this is what i mentioned
[1:12:47] before is he has chosen us in him before
[1:12:50] the foundation of the world that's the
[1:12:51] scripture he has chosen us right we
[1:12:54] didn't choose him he choose us i know
[1:12:56] that for a fact
[1:12:58] i didn't i didn't go looking for god
[1:13:03] until he started to
[1:13:04] started to quit he quickened you right
[1:13:07] he quickened something that made you
[1:13:09] start to
[1:13:10] what's going on here uh i'm changing
[1:13:13] something's happened to me i'm not like
[1:13:15] i used to be
[1:13:16] people are saying you're not like you
[1:13:17] used to be
[1:13:19] you know you start doing things you
[1:13:20] didn't do before you never thought you
[1:13:22] were doing your life you know and you
[1:13:24] were starting to read things that you
[1:13:25] never and things started to disappear in
[1:13:27] your life and you had no desires all
[1:13:29] this started to happen and that's what
[1:13:30] happened
[1:13:32] he's he's there looking for you right
[1:13:33] he's called
[1:13:35] hey john
[1:13:38] now this is uh this is from uh john's
[1:13:40] presentation uh his sermon he did on
[1:13:42] predestination which was a really good
[1:13:46] there on predestination that he preached
[1:13:48] like 2020
[1:13:51] and i transcribed it and uh no no i'm
[1:13:54] sorry that's the next one i saw election
[1:13:56] there but these are just some scriptures
[1:13:58] there on election four many are called
[1:14:00] but few were chosen
[1:14:01] praising god and having favor with all
[1:14:03] the people and the lord added to the
[1:14:05] church daily such as should be saved so
[1:14:07] this is not wide open here you know the
[1:14:10] big net coming in anyone comes in and
[1:14:12] then decides i'm going to follow christ
[1:14:14] then okay i get into heaven that's not
[1:14:16] the way it was right
[1:14:18] there was a
[1:14:19] a group
[1:14:21] ordained to be saved
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:25] it says and when the gentiles heard this
[1:14:27] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:14:29] the lord and as many as were ordained to
[1:14:31] eternal life
[1:14:32] there's a group that was ordained to
[1:14:34] eternal life that god came looking for
[1:14:35] right so all this came out in the first
[1:14:38] age and it was lost in the other ages
[1:14:40] and has come out in this age right we're
[1:14:42] seeing it now brother man preach it over
[1:14:44] and over again
[1:14:45] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:14:47] he also called and whom he called then
[1:14:49] he also justified and whom he justified
[1:14:52] then he also glorified so how would he
[1:14:54] bring him in by being born again they
[1:14:56] had to be born again
[1:14:58] and that's the process
[1:15:00] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:15:02] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:15:05] let him that it's thirst come
[1:15:07] and whosoever will so this is an
[1:15:09] interesting scripture i really like it
[1:15:11] because it says the spot that's in the
[1:15:13] last part of the bible it says the
[1:15:14] spirit and the bride they're together
[1:15:16] now right
[1:15:17] they're the voice
[1:15:18] they're the voice that
[1:15:20] that you hear right
[1:15:22] it's the the spirit and the bride
[1:15:24] and then he also has a whosoever path so
[1:15:26] there is a a part for whosoever who can
[1:15:28] decide to come right yes who can decide
[1:15:31] to follow jesus who hears the word and
[1:15:34] wants to do it and and this is the
[1:15:36] foolish virgin really who decide that
[1:15:38] right and they will take the water of
[1:15:40] life freely right so they're still uh
[1:15:42] like a free will right free will that
[1:15:45] you can follow these things so it's
[1:15:47] still there but the bride the bride is
[1:15:50] the elect it has no choice
[1:15:52] it will come whether you like it or not
[1:15:55] and if you won't come he'll take your
[1:15:56] life
[1:15:57] right and we've seen that with brother
[1:15:59] bryan's brother right and other people
[1:16:01] they just said no that's it and god took
[1:16:03] their life because they had to come did
[1:16:05] they get the reward no
[1:16:07] they lose their reward right
[1:16:09] but it has nothing to do with
[1:16:11] being elected because they were part of
[1:16:13] god that's he was in
[1:16:25] if i can go backwards oh here we go
[1:16:30] so here redeem means to buy back it
[1:16:32] restores to the original owner
[1:16:35] god by his death and the shed blood
[1:16:38] brought back
[1:16:39] his own
[1:16:40] he brought back the spoken word seed
[1:16:42] bride
[1:16:44] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:16:46] me
[1:16:46] you you always were a sheep
[1:16:49] right
[1:16:50] always were sheep
[1:16:52] as we we were in the thoughts of god and
[1:16:54] then expressed in flesh there had to
[1:16:56] come a day when we would hear his voice
[1:16:59] the word and hearing that voice become
[1:17:02] aware of our father calling us and
[1:17:04] recognizing that we are the sons of god
[1:17:07] right so that's this is from john's
[1:17:09] presentation here
[1:17:10] that's what happens when you truly hear
[1:17:13] the word for the first time
[1:17:15] when it finally drops down into your
[1:17:16] heart that's when you recognize that you
[1:17:19] are a child of god
[1:17:20] and then you recognize you're not a
[1:17:22] sinner saved by grace right
[1:17:24] you're not
[1:17:25] you're you're a child of god
[1:17:27] your sins are all gone into the thing
[1:17:29] god doesn't even recognize he doesn't
[1:17:30] see it
[1:17:31] so then you you come to an another
[1:17:33] level that you know the devil is telling
[1:17:36] me and my flesh all the things i've done
[1:17:38] but you know that was things that he put
[1:17:40] on me that god took away and put in the
[1:17:42] sea of forgetfulness and gave me his
[1:17:44] righteousness and god just sees
[1:17:45] righteousness so why am i a sinner saved
[1:17:47] by grace anymore no i'm a child of god
[1:17:49] right brother brown said in the last
[1:17:52] in his last sermon and almost in the
[1:17:54] last page he said i'm no longer a son of
[1:17:56] charles daniella
[1:17:58] branham
[1:18:00] i'm a son of god
[1:18:04] we heard his voice and we cried out as
[1:18:07] did the prodigal son
[1:18:08] save me o my father i am returning to
[1:18:11] thee a son of god can go a long time
[1:18:14] before he recognizes that he is a son he
[1:18:16] can he can it could take a while right
[1:18:20] and you know this whole process is a
[1:18:21] lifetime
[1:18:22] you know the whole process of coming
[1:18:24] into
[1:18:25] maturity and coming into the adoption
[1:18:27] and that's a whole other you know level
[1:18:30] right
[1:18:31] where god can you're out of the way
[1:18:33] totally
[1:18:34] you're out of the way totally you've
[1:18:36] surrendered your life totally there's
[1:18:38] nothing that you're going to do and you
[1:18:40] see it you see it in uh
[1:18:42] uh abraham right and he he sold a go to
[1:18:47] glendale
[1:18:49] to leave er and go to the land he goes
[1:18:50] there he says i don't like this he goes
[1:18:52] to egypt you know that's not what you're
[1:18:53] supposed to do right
[1:18:56] you're supposed to stay here in this
[1:18:58] land that i give you you know canaan he
[1:19:00] said no i didn't like his famine here
[1:19:02] i'm going that's not the way it works
[1:19:03] for an adopted son
[1:19:05] but when god said to him take your son
[1:19:07] up there and and kill him
[1:19:09] sacrifice him no hesitation right yes
[1:19:13] and that's the way we come right
[1:19:15] or jacob
[1:19:16] or take any of them they learned the
[1:19:18] hard way brother branham look what he
[1:19:20] had to go through right and at the end
[1:19:22] of it
[1:19:22] no question no questioning whatsoever
[1:19:26] no god i'm not going to do that
[1:19:28] that doesn't happen
[1:19:31] so here you see the field
[1:19:33] and it talks about here another parable
[1:19:35] putting forth onto them saying the
[1:19:37] kingdom of heaven is like an unto a man
[1:19:39] who sows good seed in the field
[1:19:42] so this is this is this
[1:19:44] god going and putting out the seed into
[1:19:46] the hearts of people right we know the
[1:19:48] interpretation here we have a field and
[1:19:50] below is the soil it says he sold good
[1:19:53] seed a good man sowed good seeds
[1:19:56] matthew 20 13 but while men slept his
[1:19:59] enemy came and sowed tears among the
[1:20:02] wheat and went his way so that's the
[1:20:04] situation we find ourselves in now god
[1:20:06] put the seed out there he didn't put bad
[1:20:08] seed out there someone came and put bad
[1:20:10] seed out there it was the devil and and
[1:20:12] he was asleep didn't know
[1:20:14] right so now all of a sudden you got all
[1:20:16] that
[1:20:17] serpenty
[1:20:19] an enemy comes now and he sold a
[1:20:21] different kind of seed bad seed that the
[1:20:23] tears are weeds
[1:20:26] and he had a perfect crop there and he
[1:20:28] he only had good seeds in there
[1:20:32] so now you see his his crop and it it
[1:20:34] comes to
[1:20:36] to full life just go through this quick
[1:20:38] here but when the blade was sprung up
[1:20:40] and brought forth fruit then appeared
[1:20:41] the tears also so the servants say this
[1:20:44] is at the end now we're at the end when
[1:20:46] all this is starting to come up right so
[1:20:47] the servants of the household didn't see
[1:20:49] this till the end in our age right
[1:20:51] yes
[1:20:52] you start to understand hey there's good
[1:20:54] and bad here right
[1:20:56] so the servants of the household come
[1:20:57] and they said unto him sir thus so not
[1:21:00] so good seed in the field from whence
[1:21:03] then has it tears you only sowed wheat
[1:21:05] seed
[1:21:06] when but were seeing weeds mixed in with
[1:21:09] it so no one no one knew it you know you
[1:21:12] kind of oh boy look here's good and bad
[1:21:14] you know where all these weeds come from
[1:21:19] he said unto them an enemy has done this
[1:21:21] the servant said on him well
[1:21:23] we'll thou then that we go and gather
[1:21:26] them up and they said uh look uh there's
[1:21:28] weeds out there so do you want us to go
[1:21:31] out there and cut out all the weeds but
[1:21:33] he said no
[1:21:35] less while you gather up the tears you
[1:21:37] root up the weed with them right so you
[1:21:39] could have someone here
[1:21:41] if you want to put it to us you know
[1:21:43] there could be
[1:21:44] uh you know there's families there's
[1:21:46] could be families in here and someone is
[1:21:47] bad and you kick them out the church and
[1:21:49] the other ones who are good seed but
[1:21:51] they're upset with it and
[1:21:53] you know you've you've really kind of
[1:21:55] you know offended them and they leave
[1:21:57] the church and they get rooted up and go
[1:21:59] you know that's
[1:22:00] that's kind of the type
[1:22:02] so he says just leave it you know let
[1:22:04] god let god handle it here
[1:22:07] but he said
[1:22:09] he says
[1:22:11] when they said to come forth they're
[1:22:12] going to look exactly the same they're
[1:22:14] going to look very
[1:22:16] similar initially they're going to look
[1:22:18] the same because it's just a little
[1:22:20] green sprig so let both grow together
[1:22:23] until the harvest and the time of the
[1:22:24] harvest and i will say to the reapers
[1:22:26] gather eat together first of tears and
[1:22:28] bind them in bundles to burn them but
[1:22:30] gather the wheat into the barn
[1:22:33] so just one more on this then jesus sent
[1:22:36] the multitude away went into the house
[1:22:38] and the disciples come up to him and
[1:22:39] saying declare us the parable of the
[1:22:42] tears of the field and he answered and
[1:22:43] said unto them he that soweth the good
[1:22:45] sweet is the son of man
[1:22:48] we're going to say good seed it's the
[1:22:49] children of god the field is the world
[1:22:52] the good seed are the children of the
[1:22:53] kingdom but the tears are the children
[1:22:55] of the wicked one the enemy that sold
[1:22:57] them is the devil the harvest at the end
[1:22:59] of the world of reapers of the angels is
[1:23:01] wonderful he explains all this isn't it
[1:23:03] so therefore the tears are gathered and
[1:23:06] burned in the fire so shall it be at the
[1:23:07] end of the world
[1:23:09] so
[1:23:10] that's what's happening in our time
[1:23:11] right and birdman says it's later and
[1:23:13] you're thinking i think
[1:23:15] i'm thinking about that later than you
[1:23:16] think later than you think you know i
[1:23:18] think later and i thought that later in
[1:23:20] the year than you think
[1:23:22] means it's already happening right
[1:23:25] and it's probably happening in the
[1:23:26] message you see different things pop up
[1:23:28] and they gather together over this
[1:23:29] certain doctrine and tie together and go
[1:23:31] over here and it could be the it
[1:23:33] happened already right
[1:23:39] in the previous diagram we had satan's
[1:23:41] children we had god's children in the
[1:23:43] perfect plan of god this diagram shows
[1:23:45] the perfect plan of god
[1:23:47] the thoughts of god are only the good
[1:23:49] seeds
[1:23:50] the original field only has good seeds
[1:23:52] in it
[1:23:53] and it was a surprise right it was never
[1:23:55] meant to be
[1:23:56] it wasn't a perfect will god never did
[1:23:58] it right
[1:24:00] he allowed it but he didn't do it and
[1:24:01] satan comes in and this happened in the
[1:24:03] garden of eden when he seduced eve and
[1:24:05] he injected his own seeds in there and
[1:24:08] added to the crop
[1:24:10] but in the original mind of god the bad
[1:24:11] seeds did not exist only the good seeds
[1:24:14] existed the bad seeds don't get back
[1:24:16] in the end right they weren't in the
[1:24:18] mind of god that's the point when you
[1:24:20] look at predestination and the choosing
[1:24:22] of god god didn't come along and all
[1:24:24] these seeds good and bad were in the
[1:24:26] ground
[1:24:28] it's not that he turned them down but he
[1:24:30] didn't choose him because they were
[1:24:32] never there in the first place because
[1:24:34] somebody else planted the seed into the
[1:24:36] field he wasn't picking randomly
[1:24:39] there's a perfect will of god and it
[1:24:41] only includes good seeds but somebody
[1:24:43] comes in and corrupts it and god's got
[1:24:46] to do something about it and
[1:24:48] we are in our life always trying to
[1:24:50] figure it out
[1:24:51] what's going on here right
[1:24:53] because you're seeing different things
[1:24:54] happen like that
[1:24:56] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:24:57] and that which is born of the spirit
[1:25:00] is spirit
[1:25:02] so that's that's the review
[1:25:06] okay
[1:25:08] that's what we did last time in the
[1:25:09] sunday school
[1:25:12] so the field is is the world the good
[1:25:14] seed are the children of king just to
[1:25:16] jump off from there but the tears are
[1:25:18] the children
[1:25:20] of the wicked one so if we look here
[1:25:22] you've got the children of the kingdom
[1:25:24] and you have now we're just going to go
[1:25:25] through history and see what happened
[1:25:27] with all this
[1:25:29] so you got the children of the kingdom
[1:25:31] and the children of the wicked one
[1:25:33] and then you have good seed
[1:25:35] and you have bad seed
[1:25:38] and you have the son of man who went to
[1:25:40] seoul
[1:25:41] and you had the devil working working on
[1:25:43] the other side
[1:25:45] so when you see adam
[1:25:47] he was
[1:25:48] he was born you have to be born again
[1:25:50] right
[1:25:51] you have to be there's two ways to be
[1:25:53] born by the
[1:25:54] by the flesh or by the spirit and adam
[1:25:58] was born by the spirit now really when
[1:26:00] you're born by the flesh we would we
[1:26:01] would just call it the sex birth right
[1:26:04] that's how you come upon this earth
[1:26:06] and we can all identify with that right
[1:26:09] having been and having done it right
[1:26:11] that you know you bring forth that's
[1:26:13] that's that's what happened in the
[1:26:15] garden of eden but adam wasn't that way
[1:26:17] he was born by spoken word not true sex
[1:26:21] so and and he he had great power he had
[1:26:25] great power he had the whole earth he
[1:26:26] had the book you know he had it all and
[1:26:29] and i believe he could go up to heaven
[1:26:31] come down and he could see those things
[1:26:33] and god came to see him and he could
[1:26:34] travel but his jurisdiction was just the
[1:26:36] earth right and the earth was a part of
[1:26:38] god also the earth is within the mind of
[1:26:41] god also if you look at that before the
[1:26:43] foundation the earth was there also the
[1:26:45] earth is going to be redeemed back just
[1:26:47] like the humans it's in the in the seals
[1:26:50] as one that comes back right it'll be
[1:26:52] burnt over but it'll be uh it's still
[1:26:55] there because it was in the mind of god
[1:26:56] it's just not people it's also like
[1:26:58] things like that like the earth
[1:27:04] so john in john 1 12 13 but as many as
[1:27:08] received him to them gave him power to
[1:27:10] become the sons of god even to them that
[1:27:12] believe on his name which were born not
[1:27:14] of blood
[1:27:16] who were not of the will of the flesh
[1:27:18] nor of the will of god but of god it was
[1:27:20] the ones that were born of god it was
[1:27:23] born by the spirit
[1:27:25] so the person
[1:27:26] can be born of blood a person can be
[1:27:29] born of blood
[1:27:31] right so that's that's true the sex
[1:27:33] birth that it it can be done like that
[1:27:35] and not necessarily be
[1:27:37] born of god right
[1:27:39] and it can be born of the will of flesh
[1:27:41] so you could the couple could decide
[1:27:43] we're gonna have one right and they have
[1:27:45] one you know that can go on in the world
[1:27:48] today and god is all behind it and says
[1:27:50] but it doesn't necessarily mean it's
[1:27:51] going to be like it was in the original
[1:27:53] plan of god where this one would be here
[1:27:56] in eternity you know
[1:27:58] this could happen and the scripture also
[1:28:00] said it can be born of the will of man
[1:28:03] where flesh gets in right and it
[1:28:05] produces a child but there is a birth of
[1:28:08] god
[1:28:10] so then after that was the fall
[1:28:12] and then through the sex birth you see
[1:28:15] the first three coming cain abel and
[1:28:16] said so if you're if you're born through
[1:28:19] sex birth you're on the right side here
[1:28:22] that's where you are everyone is
[1:28:24] right and we know there's a lot over
[1:28:26] here right
[1:28:30] so if you go through the old testament 4
[1:28:32] 000 years
[1:28:34] it's all everyone was born this way
[1:28:36] right so you could have the anointing of
[1:28:39] god and the prophets would have the
[1:28:40] anointing on their spirit
[1:28:42] or they would have anointing on their
[1:28:44] flesh of god and the presence of god but
[1:28:47] there was no one born again
[1:28:50] we understand that right there's no one
[1:28:52] where that gene seed was quickened
[1:28:55] right
[1:28:57] so in
[1:28:58] you know just a couple of the
[1:29:00] uh
[1:29:01] important periods where
[1:29:04] in genesis 6 1 just before noah's day
[1:29:06] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[1:29:08] and they were fear and that took them
[1:29:09] wives of them so there was a mixing here
[1:29:12] there was a crossover that is the first
[1:29:14] time that happened where these two
[1:29:15] lineages where where uh
[1:29:18] kane went off and he was he he was
[1:29:21] exiled and there was a whole lineage
[1:29:25] started and over here was able it was k
[1:29:28] seth and his lineage was started here
[1:29:30] but they mixed in 6-1
[1:29:33] that's when they the the sons of
[1:29:37] the the daughters of men and the sons of
[1:29:39] god mixed and then they lost track of it
[1:29:42] you know
[1:29:43] but then but then the flood came and it
[1:29:45] started again with the three
[1:29:47] sham and jam
[1:29:50] so under the law then
[1:29:54] in in leviticus under the law it talks
[1:29:56] about that redeemer
[1:29:58] so they went every year with their
[1:30:00] sacrifice every year this animal
[1:30:02] sacrifice that we've read about there
[1:30:04] and it didn't have it it didn't produce
[1:30:07] uh uh you know it didn't it used animal
[1:30:10] blood right to make a sacrifice for one
[1:30:13] year where their sins were forgiven but
[1:30:15] every year they had to repeat and to
[1:30:16] repeat and it was in they were in jail
[1:30:18] for the rest of time
[1:30:20] they couldn't get out of it because
[1:30:22] there was no one
[1:30:23] who could
[1:30:24] who could uh
[1:30:26] fulfill this scripture in the law
[1:30:29] that a human
[1:30:30] could die and pay the price for that
[1:30:33] right because there was no such human
[1:30:35] right there was no such kin
[1:30:37] they couldn't do it all through the
[1:30:38] kinsmen redeemer
[1:30:40] so
[1:30:41] so they couldn't do it
[1:30:44] so here in
[1:30:45] in
[1:30:46] in
[1:30:48] in 700 bc
[1:30:50] you see the scripture says that
[1:30:52] the prophecy that came forth therefore
[1:30:54] the lord himself wonderful prophecy
[1:30:57] shall give you a sign
[1:30:59] behold a virgin shall conceive whoa that
[1:31:03] would work
[1:31:04] right you could produce a human here who
[1:31:06] didn't have the original sin
[1:31:08] right who didn't have that sin who could
[1:31:10] die
[1:31:11] for those those who did did have that
[1:31:14] sin
[1:31:14] and they could be redeemed
[1:31:16] right
[1:31:17] this is a plan this is good
[1:31:21] so that's what you see through the old
[1:31:22] testament that there was only adam here
[1:31:25] who was ever
[1:31:26] born of god
[1:31:29] who didn't need that but now adam i
[1:31:31] didn't do it but he did come over to the
[1:31:34] right side right because soon as he
[1:31:36] sinned he was he was put over here under
[1:31:39] that and he needed a redeemer adam did
[1:31:41] right
[1:31:42] and he joined with with eve but he
[1:31:44] needed to redeem her himself because he
[1:31:47] after a while he was he was like us and
[1:31:50] you know i i kind of i sensed god around
[1:31:52] you know
[1:31:53] and he's trying to tell me something and
[1:31:56] you know trying to figure out what to do
[1:31:57] you've all been there you know trying to
[1:31:59] figure out the will of god adam fell
[1:32:01] right into that i'm sure right
[1:32:02] because he he just lost that presence of
[1:32:05] god he had that darkness he had that
[1:32:07] ephesians 2
[1:32:09] darkness come over and he was subject to
[1:32:11] his flesh you know
[1:32:14] imagine a conviction he had
[1:32:26] lost my
[1:32:29] animation
[1:32:31] so here we go
[1:32:32] i got half it here
[1:32:34] i didn't check that over
[1:32:36] anyway
[1:32:38] i
[1:32:38] now you see the enter
[1:32:42] so now coming into the new testament we
[1:32:43] see mary she was in the same boat solas
[1:32:46] uh
[1:32:47] so
[1:32:48] she is we know she's the one that's
[1:32:50] going to fulfill
[1:32:51] uh 7 14. so all those years from 700 bc
[1:32:55] right up to this this time when mary
[1:32:57] came on the scene you know
[1:32:59] jews tried to figure out what that was
[1:33:01] and they try to and just like
[1:33:03] regular humans they try to figure out
[1:33:04] what god is trying to say in his
[1:33:06] prophecy and they say oh that's
[1:33:07] fulfilled knows not and you know because
[1:33:10] you know the law of god is he doesn't he
[1:33:13] doesn't uh uh reveal anything
[1:33:16] until it's it's being fulfilled right
[1:33:19] you know god is the interpreter of his
[1:33:21] own word you know that message so that's
[1:33:23] what happens and we saw that in our age
[1:33:25] and uh you know when the seven seven
[1:33:28] seals or the seven church ages he
[1:33:30] doesn't really reveal anything until the
[1:33:32] seventh
[1:33:34] you know and he so in the seventh age
[1:33:36] then a prophet comes and reveals about
[1:33:38] all the ages and then and the seven said
[1:33:40] he reveals about all the seals
[1:33:42] and in the trumpets well he didn't right
[1:33:46] because the seventh seventh trumpet is
[1:33:48] not revealed until 11 revelations 11 15
[1:33:51] 144 000 in the two prophets
[1:33:54] so then when that seventh trumpet is
[1:33:56] revealed then
[1:33:58] the other seals were
[1:34:00] trumpets will be revealed one to six and
[1:34:02] seven but brother brown didn't know
[1:34:04] about five and six because it fell in
[1:34:07] his period so he didn't know something
[1:34:09] about remember he went defeat the to
[1:34:11] preach the feast of trumpets and god
[1:34:12] said no can't do it right he couldn't do
[1:34:14] it but he did get now he did and he just
[1:34:17] went and talked about the feast of
[1:34:18] trumpets that's what he talked about but
[1:34:20] he did understand five and six because
[1:34:23] it related to
[1:34:24] first world war and second war and all
[1:34:25] that so he didn't understand that god
[1:34:28] god showed him that and showed us us but
[1:34:29] we don't know the fullness of that and
[1:34:32] only the jews will get that in that case
[1:34:34] and this is the case here with mary
[1:34:36] right
[1:34:37] so he had so let's just turn the
[1:34:38] scriptures there
[1:34:39] to uh
[1:34:42] revelation uh sorry
[1:34:44] luke
[1:34:46] luke uh there's somebody guess before
[1:34:48] mary came out there
[1:34:50] one
[1:34:56] i got it written here not good for
[1:34:57] following my notes
[1:34:59] sorry it's in the animation there
[1:35:01] so luke 128
[1:35:04] i didn't have it all here because it
[1:35:06] would take up too much room
[1:35:11] luke 128
[1:35:13] and
[1:35:14] the angel came
[1:35:16] came unto her and said hail
[1:35:19] thou art highly favored the lord is with
[1:35:22] thee blessed art thou among women so we
[1:35:24] know the scripture pretty good and then
[1:35:25] she saw him and she was troubled at his
[1:35:27] saying and cast it in her mind what
[1:35:30] manner of salvation this should be she's
[1:35:32] totally unaware of all this right and
[1:35:34] the angel said unto her fear not mary
[1:35:36] for thou has found favor with god
[1:35:39] god bless her and behold thou shalt
[1:35:41] conceive in thy womb
[1:35:43] so here's coming here's coming now a a
[1:35:46] new
[1:35:47] this is born again here right
[1:35:49] something is going to conceive
[1:35:51] in mary but not true sex right it's
[1:35:54] going to come through god right
[1:35:58] and this way it was supposed to be in
[1:35:59] the beginning
[1:36:01] and thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[1:36:03] bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:36:05] name jesus there's a lot in that verse
[1:36:07] he shall be great and shall be called
[1:36:09] the son of the highest and the lord god
[1:36:12] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:36:15] father david and he shall reign over the
[1:36:17] house of jacob forever and of his
[1:36:19] kingdom there shall be no end
[1:36:22] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[1:36:24] this be saying i shall not a man
[1:36:27] shall i i think i know not a man so she
[1:36:30] goes back to the other birth right
[1:36:33] the sex birth and the angel answered and
[1:36:35] said the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[1:36:37] and the power of the highest shall
[1:36:39] overcome thee
[1:36:40] therefore also that holy thing that
[1:36:42] shall be born in thee shall be called
[1:36:44] the son of god that's you right that's
[1:36:45] us
[1:36:46] you know the holy ghost comes over us
[1:36:48] and it's quickened in us that seed and
[1:36:51] we become not the son of
[1:36:53] god but a son of god
[1:36:57] and thirty-six and behold the covenant
[1:37:00] by cousin elizabeth she also has
[1:37:02] conceived a son
[1:37:04] sex birth in our old age
[1:37:06] and this is the
[1:37:08] six months with her who has called
[1:37:10] who was called barren but with god
[1:37:12] nothing shall be impossible for mary
[1:37:14] said behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:37:16] beat unto me according to thy word and
[1:37:18] the angel departed from her amen this
[1:37:22] wonderful scripture
[1:37:23] so here it is in 35 that we just read
[1:37:28] so through the spoken word
[1:37:31] jesus came into being right that man who
[1:37:33] came into being so all here over in in
[1:37:36] isaiah 7 14 and that's prophesied that
[1:37:39] just spins around
[1:37:41] wait and it will be fulfilled everything
[1:37:43] that god says will be fulfilled and then
[1:37:45] zoom adheres to time and the angel comes
[1:37:48] angel gabriel comes to mary and says
[1:37:51] you know
[1:37:52] this is it
[1:37:53] this is the fulfillment of it no one
[1:37:55] knew it no one understood it no one
[1:37:56] would have believed it but this is what
[1:37:58] happened and mary believed it and she
[1:38:01] had to believe it right
[1:38:04] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:38:06] among us and we beheld the glory
[1:38:08] of the only begotten son of god
[1:38:11] full of grace and truth
[1:38:14] matthew 27 52 when the graves were
[1:38:16] opened
[1:38:17] and many bodies of saints were
[1:38:19] which have slept a row so we cut we come
[1:38:22] down through it and we see all the old
[1:38:24] testament saints that we saw in the
[1:38:25] previous slide who didn't all of these
[1:38:28] are they stayed in there in the in the
[1:38:31] with god we we know where they were
[1:38:33] you know they were in in that
[1:38:35] place
[1:38:36] there and it talks about where it talks
[1:38:38] about uh
[1:38:39] lazarus and he was in the bosom of
[1:38:41] abraham and they could see him and there
[1:38:42] was a great gulf fixed but they could
[1:38:44] see over there
[1:38:45] you know the the rich man and he could
[1:38:48] see and he wanted lazarus to come over
[1:38:50] right
[1:38:52] so it was a great gulf
[1:38:53] yeah so here now at the end at the end
[1:38:56] once we're at calvary
[1:38:58] then once in
[1:39:00] in
[1:39:01] matthew 27 they were all resurrected
[1:39:04] with jesus so the price has been paid
[1:39:07] the the kinsmen redeemer has fulfilled
[1:39:10] that blood sacrifice and all of these
[1:39:12] people
[1:39:13] that you know
[1:39:15] uh looked forward to that
[1:39:18] prophecy being fulfilled
[1:39:20] now have been redeemed right yeah so
[1:39:22] there and we see it in psalms where they
[1:39:25] you know open your gates open your gates
[1:39:27] that's when jesus let him out of there
[1:39:30] and they went from that place where they
[1:39:31] were with that great gulf fixed they
[1:39:33] went in to the sixth dimension
[1:39:35] underneath the altar that's where they
[1:39:36] went
[1:39:37] so so they were taken out of there and
[1:39:39] they were redeemed so they had to wait
[1:39:41] for that to be fulfilled and then they
[1:39:43] were they had to sacrifice and take it
[1:39:45] out wonderful right god's plan so they
[1:39:47] really moved over here they were they
[1:39:49] were in that condition now where they
[1:39:51] would be
[1:39:52] going back into uh the presence of god
[1:39:55] in that resurrection right
[1:39:59] so the plan of redemption when jesus
[1:40:01] said
[1:40:02] it was finished the plan of redemption
[1:40:04] was that the price was paid really it
[1:40:06] was just
[1:40:07] satan
[1:40:08] didn't have any power he lost everything
[1:40:11] it went back to christ and but there was
[1:40:13] still more to be redeemed but this is
[1:40:15] the way they were going to be redeemed
[1:40:16] right they opened the way now with the
[1:40:18] redemption that they would be the holy
[1:40:21] ghost would come upon them and they
[1:40:23] would be
[1:40:24] you know
[1:40:26] a change right and they would have the
[1:40:28] new birth right glory so that's what
[1:40:30] happened here my sins were paid for when
[1:40:33] it was finished
[1:40:34] my healing was paid for when it was
[1:40:37] finished
[1:40:38] all that happened in isaiah 53 jesus
[1:40:40] christ allowed them to lay the stripes
[1:40:42] on his back so that i could be healed
[1:40:44] right so we're already healed right
[1:40:46] everyone is already
[1:40:48] healed why would i refuse that
[1:40:52] why would i refuse what he has already
[1:40:54] paid
[1:40:56] for for me right
[1:40:58] so it's all there you just accept it and
[1:41:00] of all the things you know when i you
[1:41:03] know i think you know with me i've come
[1:41:04] down to you have to believe especially
[1:41:07] us under the abrahamic covenant because
[1:41:10] we're under the royal seed that jesus
[1:41:13] did it all uh god said he was going to
[1:41:15] do all of it
[1:41:16] we didn't have to do anything it wasn't
[1:41:17] a conditional covenant it was totally
[1:41:19] unconditional right
[1:41:21] and we just had to believe abraham he's
[1:41:23] the father of faith he just believed so
[1:41:26] we don't give ourselves faith i don't
[1:41:27] give you faith god gives us faith right
[1:41:30] so he gives us faith and then he rewards
[1:41:32] you
[1:41:33] he gives you faith to believe right
[1:41:36] that's all he got to do is believe and
[1:41:38] then he rewards you for the faith you
[1:41:40] have that he gave you
[1:41:42] hebrews 11. glory so really you need
[1:41:45] faith
[1:41:46] to believe
[1:41:48] under our covenant right
[1:41:49] which is the royal city of abraham amen
[1:41:52] and that covenant is still
[1:41:54] still open right
[1:41:56] yeah
[1:41:57] so we just have to believe you have to
[1:41:59] believe that
[1:42:05] i i just fooled up my
[1:42:08] my things
[1:42:09] my animation
[1:42:12] then pentecost see we're going down
[1:42:14] through history here right see how god
[1:42:16] did this right through
[1:42:18] through the spirit and through the flesh
[1:42:21] and this is how he worked it all out
[1:42:23] right
[1:42:24] my view
[1:42:26] so then you see the disciples coming up
[1:42:29] here in the pentecost and they received
[1:42:30] the holy ghost right all of these
[1:42:33] received the holy ghost and you know
[1:42:35] they were fearful first and then the
[1:42:37] spirit came down it was quickening the
[1:42:39] seed and they re they they were
[1:42:41] quickened and also received the holy
[1:42:42] ghost there was a hundred the disciples
[1:42:44] the 120 that were in the upper room all
[1:42:47] received it
[1:42:48] and then there were three three thousand
[1:42:50] souls that were saved these were the
[1:42:51] first ones over here on the on the left
[1:42:54] receiving this right born-again
[1:42:56] experience
[1:42:59] and then of course going out to the
[1:43:00] gentiles after
[1:43:02] paul turned from the jews went to the
[1:43:04] gentiles and those were ordained
[1:43:07] as we said earlier i just got a little
[1:43:09] repeated here then they gladly received
[1:43:11] his word were baptized and the same day
[1:43:13] they were added unto them about 3 000
[1:43:16] souls that were born again
[1:43:19] not by the spirit not by the flesh but
[1:43:21] by the spirit
[1:43:23] and the lord added to the church daily
[1:43:26] such as should be saved
[1:43:29] and when the gentiles heard this and as
[1:43:32] many as were ordained to eternal life
[1:43:34] believed right
[1:43:35] so these these are going to go this is
[1:43:37] the bride we're talking about this is
[1:43:39] going to go there's no
[1:43:41] you know you might think that you're
[1:43:42] deciding whether you're doing this or
[1:43:44] not but you're not
[1:43:45] this is this is elect
[1:43:48] god's family is birthed by the word
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:53] so the world on the other side
[1:43:55] still carry on the same
[1:43:56] born by sex and unless you get over to
[1:43:59] this column
[1:44:00] you're not going to be there
[1:44:02] you'll be you'll be resurrected in the
[1:44:05] second resurrection but you go to the
[1:44:07] judgment none on the r on the left will
[1:44:09] be going through the judge you don't
[1:44:10] want to go to the judge you don't want
[1:44:12] to go in there with your with your own
[1:44:13] works right and try to prove what you
[1:44:15] did you did
[1:44:17] because the the flesh
[1:44:18] the flesh you know is just
[1:44:21] powerful
[1:44:22] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:44:25] the kingdom of god
[1:44:27] except the man be born of water and of
[1:44:30] the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom
[1:44:32] of god
[1:44:35] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:44:38] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:44:40] spirit right as jesus taught and that's
[1:44:43] the way it is today
[1:44:45] it's a flesh birth and a spirit birth
[1:44:48] and then after the church ages it was
[1:44:49] strictly the bride
[1:44:51] and then the rapture we see the jews in
[1:44:54] 144 000 coming under the same message
[1:44:58] and had to be born again
[1:45:00] right just like because it's it's open
[1:45:01] now they don't have to do a sacrifice
[1:45:03] anymore they don't know it because
[1:45:04] they're blinded but they have to be born
[1:45:07] of the spirit
[1:45:08] the holy ghost has to overcome them
[1:45:11] uh come upon them and quicken that seed
[1:45:13] that's in them
[1:45:15] amen
[1:45:18] i just like this here uh
[1:45:20] this is
[1:45:23] you know it talks about being born again
[1:45:24] in verse 22 but it says seeing you have
[1:45:26] purified your souls and obeying the
[1:45:28] truth
[1:45:29] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:45:31] of the brethren see that you love one
[1:45:32] another with a pure heart fervently
[1:45:35] and i just wrote this out here seeing
[1:45:37] you have purified your just to explain
[1:45:39] this this party says every time you line
[1:45:42] up to the word you're chipping off part
[1:45:44] of the old nature purifying the soul
[1:45:48] the soul itself is pure
[1:45:50] it came from god
[1:45:52] but there is this whirly nature
[1:45:53] overshadowing
[1:45:55] and we have a tendency to lean into that
[1:45:58] but how do i get my soul washed you walk
[1:46:01] in the spirit obey the word in the
[1:46:03] spirit and you can't do it yourself but
[1:46:05] by walking in the spirit god can cause
[1:46:07] you to start living the word
[1:46:10] with every little step of obedience
[1:46:12] there's chipping way of the old worldly
[1:46:15] nature purifying the spirit
[1:46:18] so this uh quote here
[1:46:20] quickly uh
[1:46:22] and that's what the christian does when
[1:46:24] you're planted in the christ jesus
[1:46:26] everything that you have need of is in
[1:46:29] earth's journey is
[1:46:30] is in you when you receive the holy
[1:46:32] spirit i think it's priscilla and the
[1:46:34] only thing that you have to do is drink
[1:46:36] drink and push out and push out just
[1:46:39] drink till you can't drink no more right
[1:46:44] if you need a
[1:46:45] if if you have need of divine healing go
[1:46:48] to god's word and drink from it until
[1:46:50] you push it out right
[1:46:52] if you need more of god just keep
[1:46:54] drinking and pushing out and christ is
[1:46:56] the inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:46:58] and if you're planted in him the only
[1:47:01] thing you have to do is drink of his
[1:47:03] goodness
[1:47:04] and push out whatever you have need
[1:47:07] in this search journey
[1:47:09] and this is nice here it's all drinking
[1:47:12] resting peace
[1:47:14] it's not what you struggle and strive
[1:47:17] and pull at you defeat the very purpose
[1:47:19] that you're representing when you do
[1:47:21] that amen just rest in god right
[1:47:24] lovely quote
[1:47:26] so you know you the more you put in
[1:47:28] there and and the opposite unfortunately
[1:47:31] the the the opposite is true too the
[1:47:34] more the other stuff you drink in it
[1:47:36] will push out right
[1:47:37] but you're drinking the good stuff and
[1:47:39] all of that comes out you know what god
[1:47:41] has desire for you right
[1:47:43] for that
[1:47:44] glory
[1:47:45] scripture being born again not of
[1:47:47] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[1:47:49] the word of god
[1:47:51] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:47:55] therefore the word of god brings a birth
[1:47:59] i just threw that in there so here just
[1:48:01] going back to this
[1:48:03] picture and you see that the uh
[1:48:05] uh the the
[1:48:07] this first part the flesh the body part
[1:48:10] is a
[1:48:11] it now it it doesn't become a position
[1:48:14] of dominion i gotta cut off here over
[1:48:16] here this once a man is born again he's
[1:48:19] quickened and in his soul
[1:48:21] and then this is the the
[1:48:23] domination this is the position of
[1:48:25] domination this is the one that's in
[1:48:27] control now right
[1:48:28] and but this flesh still stays as a
[1:48:30] position of influence they're in a place
[1:48:33] of influence they still and i got to
[1:48:35] fade it out but it it has the old nature
[1:48:37] has the
[1:48:38] has the attributes of you know adultery
[1:48:40] fornication all those things you know
[1:48:41] that's in that spirit that we see in the
[1:48:44] news there and with different people
[1:48:47] but then also and you can still have
[1:48:48] that but you had to bring that under
[1:48:50] control right you had to bring all those
[1:48:51] things under control you'll have him
[1:48:52] until you know i remember his sister
[1:48:55] sister uh sadie and
[1:48:57] dying and she was still fighting you
[1:48:59] know you're still fighting those things
[1:49:00] right you know but uh you know
[1:49:04] you'll have him right up to the end
[1:49:05] because you're in that flesh right and
[1:49:06] the flesh is just tormenting all the
[1:49:08] time the devil don't leave you alone and
[1:49:09] he knows your weak spot right
[1:49:11] you know he knows your weak spot i just
[1:49:13] got a good quote on that after and
[1:49:16] and also here with the new nature god's
[1:49:18] nature is love joy peace all of those
[1:49:20] things so that becomes the position of
[1:49:23] domination right dominion right
[1:49:26] so now there's a union and now you are a
[1:49:28] new creature in the soul the old nature
[1:49:30] is burned out of you your new nature is
[1:49:32] god and the spirit shifts with the
[1:49:34] nature
[1:49:36] but the old nature is always there to
[1:49:37] haunt you because you are still in this
[1:49:39] body that has the old nature
[1:49:43] the old nature loses the position of
[1:49:44] dominion but it moves down to a place of
[1:49:47] influence so it will torment you
[1:49:50] and bring up stuff
[1:49:52] and satan will bring up stuff but he has
[1:49:54] no power he can't go to god and say look
[1:49:56] what he did god god says i don't see it
[1:49:59] you know i i don't see it it's all gone
[1:50:01] in the sea of god's forgetfulness and
[1:50:03] you know the righteousness is upon you
[1:50:05] so god doesn't take it into account at
[1:50:08] all so satan doesn't do that anymore
[1:50:09] it's a waste of time but he'll torment
[1:50:11] you
[1:50:13] it will try to condemn you over the
[1:50:14] things that is that you did in the flesh
[1:50:16] but it has no power right it has no
[1:50:18] power
[1:50:20] and they that are christ have
[1:50:22] crucified the flesh
[1:50:24] with the affections and lust if we live
[1:50:26] in the spirit let us walk in the spirit
[1:50:27] let us not be desirous of bangor
[1:50:30] provoking one another and being
[1:50:32] one another and it also says you know uh
[1:50:35] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:50:37] and james but it also says before the
[1:50:39] verse before that was submit your life
[1:50:41] to christ it says before that so
[1:50:44] that's uh that's a condition there
[1:50:47] so this is what i talked about here in
[1:50:49] uh in the days of daniel's time to re
[1:50:52] how can i overcome he says there were
[1:50:54] four overcomers that could stand the
[1:50:55] test of the fire and the lion
[1:50:58] so talking about the three hebrew
[1:50:59] children and daniel now we're expected
[1:51:01] to be tested that's a good lesson for my
[1:51:03] brother back there also he that comes to
[1:51:05] god
[1:51:06] must first be tested
[1:51:08] tested with the word that's god's test
[1:51:10] do you believe it
[1:51:12] he that cometh to god
[1:51:14] must be tested
[1:51:16] that only shows a true child then be
[1:51:19] tested and when the test comes on you
[1:51:21] can't overcome less there's a test
[1:51:25] give to you and when
[1:51:27] and when
[1:51:29] and when test is given when the test is
[1:51:30] given
[1:51:31] it's to see whether you can overcome or
[1:51:33] not and jesus says to him that
[1:51:35] overcometh
[1:51:36] the test the test is the greatest thing
[1:51:40] that ever happened to you what's the
[1:51:42] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[1:51:44] is your test right to overcome
[1:51:49] and we know that's in
[1:51:50] revelation there i believe it's written
[1:51:52] in the scripture peter said our trials
[1:51:54] are worth more to us than precious gold
[1:51:58] it's all it's a testing time it's one
[1:52:01] good evidence of us that god is with us
[1:52:03] and when we're tested for all children
[1:52:06] of god are tested and tried right
[1:52:09] so there's something comes with it right
[1:52:12] and there's something in us all
[1:52:13] different
[1:52:14] but
[1:52:15] you know we have to overcome
[1:52:17] and that's our test
[1:52:20] that's right help us
[1:52:27] this is another part here i'll just
[1:52:29] finish up with this one i'm
[1:52:31] an hour and five minutes
[1:52:34] sounds like the churches these days
[1:52:36] doesn't it
[1:52:37] i have five more minutes
[1:52:42] and as i may so say levi also who
[1:52:45] receive a tithe
[1:52:47] pay at tithes in abraham
[1:52:49] so bernab talks about this many many
[1:52:51] times
[1:52:52] and he says that levi
[1:52:54] paid tithes
[1:52:56] in abraham right when he was in abraham
[1:53:00] so if you look at these four generations
[1:53:01] and brother brown says now look now you
[1:53:03] begin to be germanized as your body in
[1:53:06] your great grandfather so
[1:53:08] brother brown used to go back four
[1:53:09] generations when he said perry greenlee
[1:53:11] went back he goes back four generations
[1:53:12] he sees him in there in four generations
[1:53:15] just like levi right remember the story
[1:53:17] there
[1:53:18] green told that yeah yeah no no no
[1:53:20] so he he says perry green here's his
[1:53:23] shoe and he goes describes his father
[1:53:26] and then his grandfather and his
[1:53:28] great-grandfather he said you had a
[1:53:29] different name then you you had a
[1:53:31] different name green wall or something i
[1:53:32] don't know what it was and so he goes
[1:53:34] back four generations that's what he
[1:53:36] sees and this is this is where he's
[1:53:38] coming off here because he says that
[1:53:40] levi that that germ that tiny little
[1:53:43] germ started in abraham for levi and
[1:53:46] that's why he was accredited for tithes
[1:53:48] because he was in abraham right that's
[1:53:49] right
[1:53:50] so he says now you begin to be
[1:53:52] germanized as your body and your great
[1:53:54] grandfather the germ began
[1:53:56] begin to begin to become active did you
[1:53:59] know that so levi started to become
[1:54:01] active in abraham
[1:54:03] right
[1:54:05] why why here
[1:54:07] it says
[1:54:09] levi pay tides when he was in the loins
[1:54:11] of abraham his grandfather is that right
[1:54:14] now if you were germatized in your great
[1:54:16] grandfather come out through your
[1:54:18] grandfather down to your father
[1:54:21] then
[1:54:22] then in and that's how you become
[1:54:24] germanized for your body interesting you
[1:54:26] know
[1:54:29] you begin
[1:54:30] in your germ of life when you become
[1:54:32] dramatized in your great grandfather
[1:54:34] that scripture levi pay tithes in the
[1:54:36] loins of abraham his grandfather all
[1:54:38] right put but your germ your life your
[1:54:41] soul began in the creation of god in the
[1:54:44] beginning
[1:54:45] that germ right sons of god shouted for
[1:54:47] joy right
[1:54:49] that's where you began
[1:54:52] in the creation of god in the beginning
[1:54:53] didn't jesus tell us to save us i knew
[1:54:55] you before the foundation of the world
[1:54:57] called us ordained us to be ministers of
[1:54:59] the gospel and so forth it's the for
[1:55:03] for for ordination of god
[1:55:06] and the natural types of spiritual right
[1:55:08] so it goes back four generations so
[1:55:11] very i sent you except a corner we
[1:55:14] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[1:55:15] alone if i but if i die it brings forth
[1:55:18] much fruit
[1:55:20] and we know that scripture right
[1:55:21] in john
[1:55:23] and we saw that in the dark ages where
[1:55:26] it's pretty well the church almost
[1:55:27] completely died and went into the ground
[1:55:30] and then it came out
[1:55:31] in the luther's age in the
[1:55:34] in that fifth church age
[1:55:37] so i i just heard two
[1:55:42] so jesus said that that corn of corn of
[1:55:45] wheat that germ was planted then that
[1:55:47] was him right that was him he went there
[1:55:50] and it came up here in luther
[1:55:52] in justification because the natural
[1:55:54] types are spiritual so if we talk about
[1:55:56] those three ages
[1:55:58] this is where this is where the germ of
[1:56:00] life came in
[1:56:01] here for this age right so we were
[1:56:03] really back there
[1:56:05] because our germs started
[1:56:07] back in that day
[1:56:08] when he went into the ground right
[1:56:11] so usually with first usually with the
[1:56:15] the church ages first generation second
[1:56:17] and third generations it starts to fall
[1:56:20] and you see in matthew 24 the holy ghost
[1:56:22] the holy spirit the oil ran out right
[1:56:25] so after a few generations it starts you
[1:56:28] know things start getting in there and
[1:56:30] it starts to denominate and that's what
[1:56:32] happened in the
[1:56:33] the in the lutheran age and they just go
[1:56:35] straight line they take no turn
[1:56:38] they just go on and they think they're
[1:56:39] going to retirement
[1:56:41] that's what heaven is to them right
[1:56:43] they just seem to die and they go on i
[1:56:45] just obeyed this but
[1:56:47] but
[1:56:48] but what happened is
[1:56:50] that just denominated god left it and he
[1:56:53] started up another
[1:56:54] another age right in the western age
[1:56:57] under the blood
[1:56:59] and then another three generations it
[1:57:01] dominates and goes on we see that you
[1:57:03] see it in the church it starts to change
[1:57:05] right
[1:57:06] it denies the word then from the next
[1:57:08] stage lutherans couldn't take wesley
[1:57:10] some could
[1:57:11] some made the jump right but
[1:57:13] a lot couldn't right yeah
[1:57:15] so then the third age comes along
[1:57:18] and then three generations
[1:57:20] and broadband usually only gives it five
[1:57:22] years right five years then the man
[1:57:25] man mixes in with the generations he
[1:57:27] talks about that in later scene age
[1:57:30] and then it denominates
[1:57:31] and it goes on
[1:57:33] right
[1:57:34] and really if you look at from what we
[1:57:36] had in the
[1:57:37] what that study we did on the three city
[1:57:39] ages really the seed that they have is
[1:57:42] really back here in pentecost right back
[1:57:44] here they didn't really go on in here
[1:57:47] for the other feast that we're into now
[1:57:49] which is the trumpets the atonement and
[1:57:51] the tabernacles right so we're we're
[1:57:53] seeing they just stop right they just
[1:57:56] believe this they don't go on they don't
[1:57:58] want it they have no need of it they
[1:58:00] just
[1:58:01] because it's not in there
[1:58:03] the first ones the first ones were the
[1:58:05] seed right
[1:58:06] the first ones that received it
[1:58:08] but it changes
[1:58:09] god keeps moving
[1:58:11] and in the message
[1:58:13] when the seals were open here
[1:58:16] and
[1:58:16] it would happen if this went for longer
[1:58:18] it would happen in this age it would
[1:58:19] have to right
[1:58:21] but in this age
[1:58:22] you know the church would go on but
[1:58:23] there's a rapture coming
[1:58:25] and would take that that group that goes
[1:58:27] out but the rest will go on whoever's
[1:58:30] left who is here by association whatever
[1:58:32] reason who god did weren't in god's mind
[1:58:35] in the beginning they will just go on
[1:58:37] into the tribulation with the rest right
[1:58:39] here you know god have mercy right
[1:58:42] so that's what happens
[1:58:44] so here it was god man he was the son of
[1:58:47] god he was a
[1:58:49] new new creation man and god met and
[1:58:51] joined he was the first of the new race
[1:58:54] he is the head of the new race
[1:58:56] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:58:58] a new creation all things have passed
[1:59:00] away behold all things are become new in
[1:59:02] the later scene age but now he's
[1:59:04] standing in the midst of the church and
[1:59:06] he stands there revealing who he is in
[1:59:08] this last age he calls himself the
[1:59:09] author of creation of god
[1:59:12] this is another creation this has to do
[1:59:14] with the church this is a special
[1:59:16] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:59:18] of the church the heavenly bridegroom
[1:59:21] created his own bride as a spirit of god
[1:59:24] he came down and created in the mary
[1:59:27] in the virgin mary the cells from which
[1:59:29] his body was born i want to repeat that
[1:59:32] he he created the very cells in the womb
[1:59:34] of mary for that body it was not enough
[1:59:37] for the holy spirit to simply give life
[1:59:40] to a human or ovum
[1:59:43] supplied by mary
[1:59:44] god created you for this day for this
[1:59:47] hour so he can man manifest himself
[1:59:49] through you completely
[1:59:51] this this is the fullness right
[1:59:53] and and the only way that you're going
[1:59:55] to get there is you have to surrender
[1:59:56] your life completely
[1:59:58] completely to this right
[2:00:01] and because he will not share it
[2:00:03] so he he has to have full control so
[2:00:06] that he's in there
[2:00:08] he wants to do what he wants to do when
[2:00:09] he wants to do it and he doesn't want no
[2:00:11] one hindering them and that's you right
[2:00:14] so you have to surrender that and you
[2:00:15] saw that with the other ones that i
[2:00:17] referenced abraham or jacob or brother
[2:00:19] branham you know they had to surrender
[2:00:21] that their will
[2:00:22] so it's not like i want to do this it's
[2:00:24] not god's you know what is your will you
[2:00:27] know
[2:00:28] if it be according to your will right
[2:00:32] he created you for this time and you
[2:00:34] were to come to the very image of him
[2:00:37] that's guaranteed
[2:00:39] it's his spirit that works in you
[2:00:41] he's bringing you to that perfection
[2:00:43] he's bringing you to the very image of
[2:00:45] himself but you have to let him he'll do
[2:00:47] it anyway but it's much easier if you
[2:00:50] let him and if you don't you will carry
[2:00:52] on like the rest of the church and go
[2:00:53] into a tribulation
[2:00:55] right but his seed will go in
[2:00:58] his seed in this age will go in that
[2:01:00] rapture right and all the other seed
[2:01:02] from the other
[2:01:03] ages will come first and then you know
[2:01:07] they will rise first right when it
[2:01:09] finally drops down into the heart that's
[2:01:10] when you recognize that you are a child
[2:01:12] of god
[2:01:16] second last slide
[2:01:20] so you see later to see it now i had you
[2:01:22] know i have a real question about
[2:01:23] laodicea it's just me i'm just thinking
[2:01:25] about it and
[2:01:26] you know i just don't think that in the
[2:01:28] seven church age that god is talking to
[2:01:30] the elect
[2:01:31] i think it's the foolish virgin because
[2:01:34] when you look down to it there's nothing
[2:01:35] in there for the elect
[2:01:37] you know because he doesn't say one good
[2:01:38] thing about him you know there's nothing
[2:01:41] in philadelphia he says
[2:01:44] he doesn't say any bad thing
[2:01:46] in the philadelphia church age
[2:01:47] everything is good he doesn't say one
[2:01:49] bad thing in that letter to the
[2:01:51] philadelphians the sixth age but in the
[2:01:53] seventh he didn't say a good thing you
[2:01:55] know so i just wonder if really it was
[2:01:57] for the elect at all
[2:01:58] and i know like uh in the man age you
[2:02:02] know that man spirit which is
[2:02:03] denominations it started in luther and
[2:02:06] that was over lutheran aged western age
[2:02:08] and i think that went up to really the
[2:02:11] the
[2:02:12] the latest scene age because it was
[2:02:14] still very denominational it was
[2:02:15] denomination
[2:02:16] and it and in the later scene age it was
[2:02:18] very much denomination until 62 and 63
[2:02:22] and brother brown said in spoken word he
[2:02:24] said i haven't come to that uh office of
[2:02:26] a prophet yet right that's right he says
[2:02:29] that in 62 at 63 he does he comes in to
[2:02:31] see us and everything changed then right
[2:02:34] then it was the man age then there was
[2:02:36] no more
[2:02:37] it was the eagle age the eagle really
[2:02:39] came into place and then it never
[2:02:41] happened so i really wonder if if if
[2:02:44] that later the same age it's just so bad
[2:02:47] right and what we're living in is so bad
[2:02:50] now i mean it's so it's getting so bad
[2:02:52] now with woke and all of that stuff
[2:02:55] and the sodom condition and it's good
[2:02:57] it's a sudden condition because it
[2:02:59] wasn't a sodom condition it wouldn't we
[2:03:01] wouldn't be in the last age right when a
[2:03:03] prophet come so it's a good thing it's
[2:03:05] there for that reason only right
[2:03:08] but it's good it's there and noah's age
[2:03:10] you know given in marriage and all of
[2:03:11] that that's that's here also right
[2:03:14] and it shows that we're in the last
[2:03:16] stage with a prophet
[2:03:17] coming on the scene
[2:03:19] so i just it's such a mess and we're
[2:03:22] we're in there with it that's what this
[2:03:24] shows is that we're into it but we're
[2:03:26] getting called out but it's a big
[2:03:28] question what you come out with
[2:03:30] right and what you take with from that
[2:03:32] age because we can get caught up with so
[2:03:33] much stuff
[2:03:34] you know this is the preaching part but
[2:03:37] you know we can get caught up with this
[2:03:38] stuff that we just have to get above it
[2:03:40] we just can't be pulling stuff over into
[2:03:43] that what i showed that rapture going up
[2:03:46] that church you know we have to be free
[2:03:48] free from that because
[2:03:50] on the only way that god is going to
[2:03:53] to
[2:03:55] you know
[2:03:57] occupy himself within us if we are
[2:03:59] totally given over to him right 100
[2:04:03] you know and you can't be dragging a lot
[2:04:05] of this stuff that we like and desire
[2:04:07] and everything like that over and over i
[2:04:09] just don't think we're going to because
[2:04:11] in before we're talking about god's
[2:04:13] creation this is a new creation adam's
[2:04:15] creation everything god everything in
[2:04:16] the right column goes into the
[2:04:18] tribulation into the
[2:04:20] into uh into
[2:04:23] lake fire everything right everything
[2:04:25] that doesn't belong to god and we're
[2:04:26] getting shaken now right you see
[2:04:28] everything's shaking right
[2:04:30] you see and now like like you're seeing
[2:04:32] uh what's happening in ukraine that's
[2:04:35] the whole world's involved that that's a
[2:04:36] shaking right that could go any which
[2:04:38] way right
[2:04:39] and you know we see that's the beast
[2:04:41] power coming up now and taking control
[2:04:44] and that's why putin lost because he
[2:04:45] took on
[2:04:46] the the beast power now you can't take
[2:04:49] the beast power and that's the one the
[2:04:50] trolls controls the economy and all of
[2:04:52] those kinds of things and putin is
[2:04:53] feeling it right you can't do that and i
[2:04:55] sent out that note from jason watkins
[2:04:57] right
[2:04:58] and he explained it real well
[2:05:01] but you know
[2:05:03] with covet the whole world's watching
[2:05:04] and ukraine the whole world's watching
[2:05:07] and you know like everything is getting
[2:05:08] shaking and we're getting shaking i'm
[2:05:10] getting shaking i just feel myself right
[2:05:13] you know and churches are getting
[2:05:15] shakings and there's a shaking going on
[2:05:17] and brother brown said there would be
[2:05:18] you know it would happen in this age
[2:05:22] and it shows the sign of the end you
[2:05:24] know because he he's getting ready to
[2:05:26] make his final move you know
[2:05:30] the man was of the old order of creation
[2:05:32] now in union with christ he has become a
[2:05:34] new creation of god this new creation is
[2:05:37] not the old creation made over or it
[2:05:39] could not be called a new creation this
[2:05:41] is exactly what it says it is a new
[2:05:43] creation it's another creation distinct
[2:05:44] from the other older one
[2:05:46] he's the first of the creation he was
[2:05:49] god created in the form of man now by
[2:05:51] his spirit he's creating many sons unto
[2:05:53] himself god's a creator creating himself
[2:05:55] a part of his creation i'm just firing
[2:05:57] through this now because it's like we
[2:05:58] are no longer a part of adam's creation
[2:06:01] adam's creation does not apply to us
[2:06:03] that's over there on the left there see
[2:06:06] the people in the world are under adam's
[2:06:08] creation and they will suffer and die
[2:06:10] under adam's creation the bride is in a
[2:06:13] different creation
[2:06:15] who are god men
[2:06:16] god women living within our human vessel
[2:06:19] to bring us to every image of
[2:06:21] of himself
[2:06:23] and we we have to come there we
[2:06:25] if you want to associate with the world
[2:06:27] and do the things of the world then you
[2:06:29] will die in adam's creation
[2:06:31] right
[2:06:32] romans 1 what shall we say then shall we
[2:06:35] continue in sin that grace may abound
[2:06:37] and in the commentaries that shall we
[2:06:39] continue under the old creation
[2:06:42] that grace may abound or shall we get
[2:06:44] into christ once you're in the christ
[2:06:46] then you're part of grace
[2:06:49] amen
[2:06:50] last slide
[2:06:52] revelation 3 14 this was talking about
[2:06:54] the beginning of the creation of god
[2:06:56] right
[2:06:58] and here how can i overcome
[2:07:01] and we ask
[2:07:02] that you
[2:07:04] you go out among the people he's praying
[2:07:06] here at the beginning and speak out
[2:07:09] that predestinated seed out there lord
[2:07:12] and bring it around
[2:07:13] in some way that the light will fall
[2:07:16] across the path lord
[2:07:18] for we believe that the hour is getting
[2:07:19] late
[2:07:20] the sun is
[2:07:21] swiftly sinking in the west
[2:07:24] then will soon be
[2:07:26] that time shall be no more time in
[2:07:28] eternity will blend together
[2:07:30] when god and his people blends together
[2:07:33] and we've as and we pray god that at
[2:07:36] that time that we will be numbered among
[2:07:38] those that will be blended
[2:07:41] into christ
[2:07:42] that's called his pride that's our
[2:07:43] prayer amen
[2:07:45] amen
[2:07:47] and the beginning
[2:07:49] amen lord bless you let's stand
[2:07:52] one hour and 20.
