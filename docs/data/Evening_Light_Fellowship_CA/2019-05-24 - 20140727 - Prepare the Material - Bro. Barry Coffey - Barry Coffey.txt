a little sesame so I am what is singer but I have preached once or twice and sing this little song and it was a blessing to some I understand amen yeah so I'll try and sing it today good god help me amen it's found in the book of st. John the gospel you put your Bible there you know the story Nicodemus came to the Lord there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that what a teacher come from God for no man can do these things this miracles that thou doest except God with him jesus answering said unto him very various aren't you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God mmm so I remember when I was a little boy Jeff a long time ago the missionaries when they came to Africa they would sing these songs and teach us when at that time I didn't really take much of it it didn't mean much to me but I remember this song amen but when I came to the Lord by His grace then this song meant so much to me and my principal message and I preached I meant I've been in the new wave hellmen so how this we try and sing it and then you can help me with a diamond there was a man called eco Tomas he came to Jesus by night and say how can a man be born how can they be born again here was a man corny Kojima he came to Jesus by night and say how can a baby born again [Music] be born and there was a they wasn't meant for Miko demons he came to Jesus by night and say how can he be born again [Music] [Applause] she was hinting for me huh he came to Jesus by night and said how can my lord [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] forget it it just wouldn't go away so I asked again Lord wash my sin and this is all he'd say [Music] what's it what's in that's as far away as the East is from the West [Music] what's it what's it and it was gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea a forgetfulness [Music] the heaviest load you carry is a load of guilt and shame [Music] you were never meant to bury so let it go in Jesus name I got a angered and he's quick to forgive our sin so just put them under the blood and don't bring it up again cuz he'll just say what's in what's in that's as far away as the East is from the West what's it [Music] what's in it was gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea a forgetfulness or please deliver me for my accusing memory nothing makes me weep this way but when I hear you [Music] what see what's in that's as far away as the East is from what's it what's in it was gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea [Music] of forgetfulness [Music] buried in the sea I forget for me [Music] [Applause] amen lor bless and thank the Lord for the special assistant this morning and surprised for it too here died in Menasha I was expecting the whole family of the sink and so the Lord bless us all we enjoyed it and I believe God was in it by the grace of God so the Lord ever bless is my prayer and I want to welcome the coffee family not the ones that are here every morning but the ones that are that are here every two years so it's not a testimony against your Christianity trusting that wherever you are that you are in worship with the Lord so I just want to welcome our brother Barry back again and look forward for the hearing of the word and the dedication of the Assembly and I know it's been on the minds of the Saints for quite a while wondering when and who was going to dedicate the the Assembly of the church to the Lord so we just waited on the Lord at least I was waiting on the Lord and there were different suggestions and we'll see what the Lord will do so the Lord he predestinated it he ordained it I believe for our brother Barry to do it having begun his ministry here having begun his testimony here that the Lord was send him back to dedicate the church here so we thank God for that and we welcome our brother and be in prayer for her brother as he comes to to minister of the word and the leaders into the dedication of the of the set of the building but also of the people that we'd be dedicated to the Lord and for his glory and so we welcome brother Barry and sister Becky and I guess is not just brother and sister now as it's not even mom and dad anymore is popping a name it just shows that we're getting older and there's another generation rising but it's also a blessing to to look and to see the younger generation serving the Lord a man I was expressing that to I think brother Matthew the other day I said that is a tremendous testimony to any church for a pastor to be able to look and see young people in the congregation because as I quoted some time ago from a book that was written by I don't know maybe some magazine like magazine Maclean's magazine and and the book was entitled they're gone and it was based on the attitude of young people towards the church and all that most young people have left the church most young people have no interest in church and they said they are gone and that is the truth and you will find that even around the message and it's the grace of God in the lives of our brother Andrew and Peter and Luke and Steven today and then and there their lives and and their children that they are still with it still pressing by the grace of God into the kingdom so I pray God bless you in your fellowship with us in these next few days and of course also to welcome the Macondo family and I assume the Colombo family will be back shortly with this week I assume Tuesday so they'll be back and when brother Bob said he said you'll take it after sister Rebecca sings and the only sister Rebecca I could think of was was our black sister so the sister Rebecca there sang was in no way like like the one that I knew and the one that we expect back on Tuesday sister Rebecca Colombo and I said Rebecca I said she's not back yet but God bless you sister and enjoyed the song and may God make it a revelation to our hearts a man so the Lord bless you all and also to ask you to remember in prayer brother Philip power in Chapel arm he was released from the hospital yesterday I believe and he is going back again on Tuesday for surgery so remember him in prayer is he's going to be out of it as it were for maybe I don't know maybe three four or five months he had moved back from Edmonton his wife is from the Yukon and so he is now living in his mother's home in Chapel arm but because of the injuries to his leg and arm it's he's he won't be able to work so pray the grace of God for him as he returns on Tuesday for surgery and also our neighbor was released from the hospital he had fallen down the steps and he was released from the hospital yesterday as well so we thank the Lord for that so I'm going to turn it over to our brother Barry and I want to thank you too for your prayers for myself and trusting that the recovery is going to be hastened by the grace of God so I can get back into the pulpit again and as I said I'm I've got a chair so I'll bring the chair sit on the chair preach by the grace of God I did that when we had surgery for the hernia and I just said Haran preach I just they're calling it's just a zeal this the enthusiasm of the Holy Ghost call in your life and brother Branson whatever you do don't lose your zeal and enthusiasm and he said don't lose the spirit of revival a man so I pray God that you know that'll be in the ministry and it was not in the ministry it won't be in the congregation so God's grace to us and we'll turn it to our brother Barry and I'll rest for for a little while so Lord bless you and look forward to the fellowship this afternoon and our brother marks so god bless you each and every one a man let's say only believe all things are possible only believers staying as our brother comes to minister Oh Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] Jesus is here [Music] [Music] orgies yes [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] let's have word of Prayer as we begin this morning dear Heavenly Father we counted a blessed privilege to be gathered together in this place today we are thrilled Lord to see what you have done over the years and now Lord to see this wonderful building just a sanctuary Lord for your presence and for your saints we are we are just so thankful Lord that you have held this group in the palm of your hand Lord and ministered through them and to them we ask and pray now that you would bless the service this day we give to you like an offering Lord an offering of praise and we ask and pray that you would just come and dwell among us today and speak to our hearts Lord we also just want to present ourselves a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto you which is our reasonable service and we ask and pray Lord Jesus that you would just speak to our hearts move among us I pray and Lord we just are so just so humble when we think about your calling in our lives Lord and your choosing how Lord Jesus in the great stream of humanity your sauce and predestinated us from before the foundation of the world and now we stand here today Lord we ask now that you would just take this day as we dedicate it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you can be seated for a moment here and I just want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is certainly good to see all of you today and they have all of you here and building our condo god bless you great to have you and I tell you I just appreciated that that singing and I feel right at home when the Africans sing I've said this many times and I mean it with all my heart that when we get to heaven we'll have a wonderful time of fellowship over there and if nobody else sings we're just gonna let the Africans sing I always said you're not in the message and until you've heard the African sing and you're not in the bride until you had the people from Malawi sing and they're just extra special and very gifted and it's just always a blessing to me so I appreciate your words and and your song today I wanted to just proceed and talk a little bit about the church here this morning before we have a word of prayer and I wanted to read the scripture together but you know I was thinking as I was walking around the building here and I see some of the familiar trappings of every church that this church has ever been in that if I remember correctly the the start of it was in in Max's building impairment on the Paramount Theatre right then old building and that's where we started first and it was two of you and you and me and mom right and that's where it began and then there was a couple of others that came and of course then brother Earl came in sister Betty god bless you came in and then from there it was Plymouth Road right no it was duck her Street in the basement of duck rich Street where I preached my first sermon that's right and we had to lock the doors because people would steal the pictures and so forth out of the lobby and we had some good meetings in that andhaka how could I forget Duckworth Street and from there it was Plymouth Road and we worshiped in the upper part of Plymouth Road for a while and then from there the car let's house right we're sister coffee son our one and only special and then from there it was a Christian Science church right for a good while and then to Al calluses right and now Conception Bay who ever would have thought we'd wind up in Conception Bay but over those years a lot has happened a lot of a lot of Ministers come through a lot of good services and a lot of things have happened and you know it's just like I say it's just a wonderful thing to see how God has led the church and bless the church and held you folks together and way out here and this outpost in Newfoundland but it's it's it's just something that's very dear to my heart and it's always a pleasure to come back and and see all of you again and I think over those years I think God honors your faithfulness and now has given you this wonderful building here and the ability to be able to you know have it for yourselves and renovate it and make it look so lovely it looks like it's always been here it's it's a fit it looks like it's the right place and maybe this would be the last place on the list you know and the next step will be in the glory and that'll be our next house but I just we're just excited for you and glad for you and trust that the Lord will bless you and meet you here and and speak to you over these years that you're in this in this place here we trust that it won't be very long but over those years we trust that good things happen here among you and the Lord will add to your numbers and and and bless you abundantly I was just recently my wife and I were in Boston we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and we went downtown they have a Heritage Trail where you can go around the downtown area and see all these historic places where significant thing things happen in the early history of America and one of the places we went into was the old meeting house and in there it was just a real thrill for me to be in there and it was a place where when it was built was two stories two or three stories high but it was a tallest building in Boston when it was built in the 1700s I believe and George Whitefield had preached in that church and but it wasn't a church it was a meeting house it was the biggest place that they could have for GAD public gatherings and church gatherings and so forth and the the Quakers would meet in there and the the fundamental churches and Cotton Mather and increase Mather and those folks I don't know if you ringing any bells here or not but they all met in this house and and the Quakers and the Puritans they believe that you know the building didn't matter to them from that from that era the building itself didn't matter they were the church they knew that we are the church and wherever we are gathered that's where the Lord would meet us and the building was inconsequential it was just a tool that we were able to use so that we could gather together because God's people like to gather together but to them they were they were convinced they didn't need to have a fancy building they didn't need to have a big structure they were the church and wherever they gathered together and there was some great ministers who came through and that public meeting house there and they they worshiped there actually for a long while and it was there just a real blessing to be and there were a George Whitefield I'd read a lot about George Whitfield over the years in the time of the Wesley brothers and different ones and so it was just a real honor to be right there had my picture taken next to the pulpit where George would feel preached but remember this that you know we appreciate the building we appreciate the structure appreciate how nice it looks and I'll break the lights are but more importantly never forget that you're the church when Jesus when Jesus went to Calvary he wasn't thinking of this he was thinking of this and that's what's really important for you to remember and and so we just trust that Lord will meet with you and and bless you abundantly now if you don't mind I'd like to sing a little course that we sing at home sister Becky if you'd come on and we'll play and Pete would you mind can we lean on you to play the bass here for this if you want to throw that up here fellows this is your house and we're gonna use this big screen here for our service this morning but these are the words of the of the song here this is your house father come and dwell and we sing this song a lot cuz we really enjoy this together here and after we sing this a time or two here maybe we'll read in the scripture and have a prayer dedication

your Bible if you don't mind I'd like to go to second chronicles the fifth chapter thank you and let's take a look here at the dedicating of Solomon's Temple here brother Brandon preached this sermon called dedication of building to the Lord back in 1959 I believe it was and he used this scripture in the dedicating of this church and this was not his own church this was a church that he was asked to dedicate in the in the u.s. I believe was in Indiana somewhere and this is the scripture that he read so let's read it together this chapter here thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of God and then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel unto Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the City of David which is Zion where for all the men of Israel assemble themselves unto the king and the feast which was in the seventh month and all the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the ark and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle these did the priests and the Levites bring up and care also King Solomon and the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitude and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place to the Oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims but the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark and the cherubims covered the Ark and the staves thereof above and they drew up the staves of the ark and the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the Oracle but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day there was nothing in the ark saved the two tab tables which Moses put therein at Horeb when the Lord made a covenant with of Israel when they came out of Egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course and also the Levites which were the singers all of them of Asaph of Heymann jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them in one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets it must have been quite a scene for them to gathered with all of these people and musicians and all the important people and the elders of Israel and it came to pass as the trumpets and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments and music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so the priests could not stay in the minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God the Lord is blessing you may be seated just for a moment here I wanted to read this little quotation here with you is brother Branham finished reading this this statement here this passage of Scripture you read the whole chapter and what I find interesting is that whenever whenever we go to do something we we prepare ourselves and and we set ourselves in a ray just like these people did back there and they had a great ceremony this was the center of worship for all of God's people so all of Israel would have been involved or affected by this great day that they had this was God moving into his tabernacle and they made this tabernacle with all the expense and all the materials and all the expert workmanship that they could put into it and they made it as good as I can but it didn't matter unless God blessed it what really mattered is that God came to it and when God reached down and said now this and your work has done this is mine now and when God stepped into it that made the difference your prayer always should be about this church that hey the the work is great though you know the facility is nice but what you don't want to have is just you here you want to make sure that he reaches down in every service and takes that and says now this is my moment this is my time to speak and this is my place and I want to breathe my life into it my glory into it so that it's not men ministering in here anymore it's the Holy Spirit speaking to you and that's really what you want to have and God is interested in doing that here as he was back in the days of Solomon back there it was a grander bigger building with more people but the principle is exactly the same that God wants to take this place and call it his own and sanctified separate it so nothing else goes on here but a welcoming spirit for his presence and then he can come anytime he wants to and speak to your hearts and and give you a rapturing faith and give you everything you have need of in this hour you can answer prayer he can heal bodies he can deliver the the the deliverable he can heal the broken hearts he can restore the joy of the Lord in your life he can do all he's an inexhaustible fountain of life and if he ever was he still is today and God can do that and so we should expect that when we come and these people wanted God's blessing there they did everything meticulously and carefully according to God's blueprint and that's the way they were all instructed and as to exactly what they needed to do and when they did it they expected God to come and he did and it was a glorious scene to behold but it was more glorious when he came and fill that place with his cloud now brother Branham said the Spirit of God and this is where you come in now the Spirit of God and the people makes the church but we also have gathering places dedicated with this church gathers together to worship God then God has given to our precious brother in this congregation this most beautiful structure and therefore we are here this morning for that purpose to dedicate it to be a place of worship to the Lord our God the temple was ready to be dedicated are you ready this morning for dedication remember now not only did Israel be ready for the dedication of the temple but they were dedicating themselves to God again when they had come in and this pastor here I believe with my heart is a man of God and I believe that he stands for the principles that God has laid out to us and so you see the dedication of a church don't only mean coming and saying Lord we give you this building but it also means Lord we give ourselves to you in sacrifice and when Israel had finally made one place that they could all dwell in came to a place and meet God under the fellowship of the blood then they begin to sing with joy they begin to play the harp they praise with they praise God in such one Accord until it sounded like one voice singing they had they had ceased their wandering they had no longer a temporary place of worship no more Max's place no more Christian science right no more call is's ain't no in a simple sense right now they now you have a place they they had a place they picked up their church and brought it with them wherever they went and they they brought it for years and hundreds of years this is four hundred and seventeen years after the exodus that's the time span here that we're talking about from Solomon's dedication where actually when they began the building of the church from there back to when Moses said let my people go we have 417 years and so for those years they actually picked up their church and put it on their shoulders and walked around with it everywhere they went and this day that stopped they said this is my place God said now you're building in a my holy hill this is this is the place that I have chosen and and if you go to Jerusalem and you stand where the temple stood and and of course the the mosque is there now but when you go there the old ancient Hebrew scholars they believe that that's the place that God reached them took a handful of dirt and created Adam that's where it all began and that was God's place and God identified that of all the places of the earth he said this is my Mountain here and this will be called the City of David the city of the Great King and I will tell you when you're there it's not like any other place in the entire world it is a unique place and God claimed it as his own and now he puts Solomon's Temple right on that exact same spot where he where he claimed it as himself that also is the same spot where Abraham took Isaac up on top of the mountain and went to sacrifice of exactly many many important things happen there but this is where God placed the church and placed Solomon's Temple and it was the end of moving now it was the end of the journey for the children of Israel in terms of worship now they were sent off in the Babylon the people win but the church never went when they went in the Babylon they never took the tabernacle with him right they never took Solomon's tabernacle with him when they went to Babylon in the days of Jeremiah but for the people in terms of worship they had been given God's chosen place right this was now God's chosen place it was no longer the sands of the desert it was now God's chosen place of worship and so brother Branham said this is not now just the dedication of a building but he said it's also ourselves and then he goes on to say then Solomon stood to pray and to mark the dedication to the Lord and when he did the ark had already been brought in under the wings of the cherubim and set back in the holy place and when the people but when the people dedicated not the church not the building but when the people got with one Accord and prayed with one Accord and sang with one Accord and everything was one Accord then the Holy Spirit in the form of the pillar fire moved into the building and settled into that place and it was so much glory in that building until the priest couldn't minister anymore God let it be again and let it come again into this little tabernacle when I saw that quote I thought this was your quote this was your moment here because with that's exactly what we want to believe that you know in praying a prayer dedication and it isn't just it isn't just a you know walls and carpet it isn't just that it's the church that we're dedicating today it's the real church that we're dedicating we thank God for the place but you know it's only a tool that we use right and it ain't going no word ain't gonna mean a millennium but God's church is what we really dedicate here today and I think that's a wonderful privilege and whenever we do I was like brother branham said God let it be again that that God would come and breathe his life into this place and and this would be a different atmosphere and a different just just a different time that you spend here than anywhere else this is not like it is at your house it's not like it isn't in the mall it's not like it is at your work this is a different place and so we want God to coming into this tabernacle so if you don't mind let's have our brothers come our elders here brother Jarrell if you'd come brother my condo if you come in and why don't we all stand to our feet this morning and mark and Bob and here we are back again and praying over over this place and let's just join our hearts together in the word of prayer and as we pray I want you to pray as well because this is not just the prayer over the place now this is the people also dedicating themselves to be praying and asking God's blessing on our own lives in his service so let's pray together Heavenly Father we counted a privilege together this morning Lord we worship you in spirit and in truth O God and you have chosen this people to come together Lord in the light of the revealed word of the hour how we thank you for it o God we never would have found our way we never would have been able to be led in the right path by our own thinking and our own mental ability but Lord Jesus you predestinated us to see this great light in the last day and to walk in that light and to believe your word and I believe this truth Lord that you've given to us we steadfastly hold in in our hearts O God we waver not from it by your grace and we stand here together today Lord and and father many memories and many years gone by but Lord Jesus we just dedicate this building to you today may it be a lighthouse Lord may it be a place where your Holy Spirit is always welcome may it be a place Lord with a sojourner in the sinner and those that are in need of help and deliverance they may come Lord through these doors and they may sense your presence I pray that father the preaching of the word may always continue here Lord to be a blessing to the people Heavenly Father we just ask that you would just breathe your life into this place and it Lord your presence would come and just take control of these services that are be held in this big building and father God we ourselves as a Church of the Living God we stand before you today and we consecrate our lives to you afresh we dedicate our hearts and our minds to you and ask and pray that your Holy Spirit would come and anoint us O God that we might not only just enter into the word of the Lord whenever it comes but Lord our lives might be living written epistles known of all men and people in this community Lord they might see us they might they might recognize that there's something different about each one lord I pray even these young people that are here energize their lives Lord teach them I pray and mold them and shape them in the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit Lord come I pray and breathe life into this place and breathe life afresh into our hearts we commit ourselves to you Lord we dedicate ourselves to you and thank you dear God for this opportunity we have to ask your blessing upon all that's done all who labored Lord all who gave and all who contributed Lord to this building today we thank you for it may it be a hallowed sanctified separate place we give it all to you Lord and we give ourselves to you afresh in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you brother thank you Jesus wonderful should have had you remain standing if you don't mind let's do it again first Kings chapter 6 trust you can see this ok we're gonna use this here this morning first Kings chapter 6 I want to read two places here in the in the Bible and now we're gonna go backwards just a little bit to the preamble to the building of Solomon's Temple here and this is an amazing story if you go back you can find it in chronicles you can also find it in Kings there it starts in first Kings chapter 5 when Hiram comes in on the scene and he's involved in the building and the materials for this building is what I want to focus on this morning here just for a little while and I will I will ask you to do two things first of all forgive me for this being strikingly this is going to be simple and many times when somebody asked me to speak at a place you know I always I always you know you just begin to pray in your search and you wonder what it is that you could say to the people I always do that I'm ministers do that but when when mark conveyed the request from brother Gerald to minister here I immediately knew this just dropped right in my heart and I knew right from there this was the right thing for me to do and so I just trust it'll be a blessing to you and then the second thing I want you to do is forget it's me all right so all you family members I need you to forget it's me just for a moment here all right Paul and just concentrate on what it is that said here because this is a even though it's a an alarmingly simple thought this is a real blessing when you think about it all right so let's just let's just focus on God's Word now for a little bit in first Kings chapter 6 and verse 7 the Bible says in the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought hither when it was in building now that's us isn't it because we're not there yet we're not for God's not finished with us yet he's still working on me so we're still in building we're still in formation if you like God is still molding us in shaping us but the stone was made ready ready before it was placed before it was brought hither so before it found its place that stone was worked on and it was made perfect before it actually was dropped in the slot designed for it okay so that there was neither hammer nor axe or any tool of iron heard in the house heard in the church while it was in building proverbs chapter 24 verse 27 you're welcome to read with me here Solomon wrote prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in the field and afterwards build on house do your work first then build your house may the Lord at his blessing you may be seated now recently I was doing a little series the back home on the subject of success and I on Wednesday nights and we've been talking about this scripture here because this actually proverbs 24 27 is the scriptural design for a man to have his own house and what Solomon is actually saying to the people here is that rather than for a young man you know maybe he gets married and leaves his father's house and he wants to go and have this great big mansion of a house he wants to have a big fancy house he's he's better off the instruction by Solomon is to prepare your trade without in the field go out in the field and make yourself established or successful in the field and save for a down payment on that house so that you're not burdened by a lot of debt and then buy your house that's actually what Solomon's wisdom is all about and this is a great study in itself but but that's what he's saying there's preparation that needs to go into the building of a house don't just go out and and assume that it's all going to come together you have to think about this and you got to pray about this and you've got a you've got to work in your field you have to work in your trade you have to work in your with your hands and the gifts that God's giving it and make it fit for thyself in thy field just like brother Joel over here he's he's as an example here he's worked hard and built that business from the incubator up there at Mun and built it up a little bit to the point where now it was a little easier for him to tackle the new house that he's built and the deck attached to it so Joe admittedly now it would have been hard for you to have done that in first year business right it would have been very hard because it was not enough established there but now it's a little easier you know for him to do that you understand the principle here that a lot of people in our culture they feel like I can have whatever ever any way everybody else has I can have a nice house because mom and dad have a nice house hey they've probably had 30 years working on this house and paying for it moving from you know moving up moving up and and that's what Solomon is saying that there's a there's a right principle in planning so that it all comes later on but there's a work that's to be done before we get there okay so that's where our title comes from this morning prepare thy work and build on house now let's take a look at it now for a moment to give you a couple of statements here just to get your thinking together brother Ram said I think when Solomon built the first temple it was cut out from all over the world all over their world back in that time shipped in they sailed some of those materials in on the Mediterranean Sea they floated some down on rivers they mined some there recently just like in the last year or so they found a quarry near the the mountain where the Solomon's Temple was actually built the uncovered this place and they figured it had to be a quarry so there was material brought from very close and there was materials brought from afar like brother man saying right here the Cedars of Lebanon floated down to Joppa Chiapas on the coast line and they hauled him in by ox cart it was so masterly built that when the temple went together it had all kinds of funny-looking stones in it hello it had all kinds of funny-looking stones in it so when they brought the materials now the materials were already completed they were already shaped they didn't have mills set up they didn't have rock crusher set up there it was all done so all these funny-looking stones now came and they were delivered right to the site but when they began to read the blueprint it was all in the blueprint and there wasn't even a buzz of a saw or a sound of a hammer for 40 years in building the temple and I think the way God's got his people all cut out I think that's the way that God's got his people all cut out so here's brother branham now he's looking back at the building of that temple and he's applying that to our time he sees there's a pattern here and he said one's got a nature of one kind and one is another he says but they're all Christians they're fitted stones joined together upon the chief Cornerstone Jesus Christ so we know that God doesn't have has earlie do anything the design or the process by which Solomon built this temple was consistent with the way that God deals with these people and I want to say this this morning that many times there's there's III observe in people over the years especially is you know in the pain the pastoral role you you notice people get stalled on the process the way that God deals with us as individuals there's a process there's a reason why certain things happen to you there's a reason why certain calamities come your way does the reason why certain occupations are natural to you there's a reason why that you have a you know an aptitude towards certain things you know there's there's a reason why God's made you like he's made you and when he called you when he called you you are not where you are now spiritually you were not where you are now right when and when God called you when God called you you were still debating about the simple things of the world whether you could continue to do those things and whether you know what part of you we're all worship did you need to let go and so a lot of that is gone now and God is still dealing with us according to his word we're still growing and we're still we're still developing spiritually isn't that right growing up in faith and growing up in strength and grace and all knowledge and all the other things that God gives to us and and brother BAM saying that the same way that Solomon planned all this so that when all of these materials came together it became a complete unit and every one of them had a specific and designated spot ordained by that person whoever he was who drew that blueprint somebody had to have a mind to be able to draw and construct that that that Temple in his own mind and then convey it to paper and give it to the 3300 managers who were on the site there were 3300 managers you can see him there you read it in the Bible in the in the in the preceding chapters there that we read and they had they had 70,000 burden bearers they had 40,000 stone cores who were scattered out where all these stones were being dug they had a multitude of workers out there but somebody in the beginning had to catch the vision of this temple and find out hey not just any temple but the Lord how do you want me to construct this temple how do you want me to build this one is what does God's house look like he had Solomon had to sit down and say what does God's house look like what what way can we build this and it had to be conveyed on the paper which is the blueprint and the blueprint went out and everybody operated according to the same blueprint we understand that God has also given us a blueprint isn't that right and he sent the blueprint out everybody's got to copy the same one I assume right so there's not a different version of the blueprint you know here and another one there and another one in Africa and another one over here and in the US the blueprint is identical and so the building instructions don't vary they're the same wherever you go the one who drew that blueprint and the blueprint itself becomes very valuable to us because we all operate in different parts of the world without communicating with one another we're all being molded or shaped by the plan that God has given to us right I've got a smart isn't he let's take a look now for a moment we'd have to assume then it would look something like this it would have we would have to assume that this is not Jerusalem this is not the mountain where Solomon's Temple sits but this is where the work went up this is where it all happened folks this is where the sound of the hammer was and the saws and the and the people laboring and how they would move those great stones around you can see the the sheer sides that I could step cliff there as they come down and they would they would somehow or another drill down in those things they would let a slab fall and they will cut it into smaller slabs so they can move it and and this was painstaking sweaty difficult work to make these stones into these sizes here and then they probably would have took the blueprint out and said all right we need 70 blocks this size well let's let's count out 7/8 and work on those 70 lay on the side and only need 80 blocks that are this side would what with you know 8 sides that are that are in this rectangle but one of them's got to be angled a little bit so they'd separate those and I mean that's where they did this work this work was done in the field it was done in the field so yeah this is not this is not Solomon's Corey's here but this is a quarry where this work is being done so we just assumed here give me a little the scriptural license here this is a this is what it would probably have looked like something like this except it would have been populated by thousands of laborers who would have been working on these stones thank God for the laborers who got all these stones ready now where did this idea come that Solomon pulled out where he said is gonna be no work done on site why would that be done because at one sense it to be easier just to ship raw materials there and let everybody do it and so they could look at the spot in other words if there was a you know if there was a piece of equipment or a block that needed to go right here on the wall wouldn't it be better for the man to go like this and make the measurements here and and and do it right here and fit it and they do it right here why what's the issue why why would that be so I think about things like that so I went back and I looked in the scripture to look at Deuteronomy chapter 17 for a moment here here's a principle that's very important moses is speaking here and he's telling the people who are not in the promised land yet he's telling them when thou art coming to the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee and shall possess it and shall dwell therein and shall say I will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me thou shalt in it now there's been no king right there's been no king yet this is under Moses ministry and then Joshua becoming the judges would come we're a long way away from Saul we're a long way away from King Saul no talk of a king yet but God knows is going to come a David later on right God knows because he knows the end from the beginning he knows the future as well as the present the past right you with me so God speaking about a king he's given instructions to a king here and there's been no talk of a king so far God is projecting way out here for when Kings King David would sit on the throne and he says thou shalt in no wise thou shalt in any wise said him king over thee whom the LORD thy God shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set the king over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses for as much as the Lord has said he shall henceforth return no more that way these are instructions now that God was given to a future king all right that's read on now just a little bit further in the same passage neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turned not away hmm neither shall he greatly multiplied to himself silver and gold and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests and levites to get it a future king had to take time to take the first five books of the Bible and he had to write him out in his own book his own journal and he had to write out all the words that were already written out on the scroll he had to write it out for himself because and it shall be with him verse 19 he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the Lord his God to keep all the words of this law and these statutes and to do them because we're not ever required just to be a hearer or a writer of the word were to be a doer of the word so God wanted this king as the first act of his official office to take his pen and write out the first five books of the the law of Moses there so that he would learn by his own handwriting what God required of him what were the commandments what were the precepts what did God really intend to write out the book of Genesis I actually think it would be a great exercise to write out the book of Genesis because you would understand it differently than if you just read it I mean I I just think it to be a good thing but now here's God God's point he said in verse 20 that his heart be not lifted up among his above his brethren and then he turned not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong these days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Israel so God wanted any king who took office to do this first so that he would be reminded that I am NOT V King I am aching but he is the king and I am here by His grace and he's the one who controls it all right and God wanted the Kings to know that and he never wanted them to consider themselves to be way up here and some great person here there's no big guys right there's no big guys there's there's we're all really at the end of the day we're all stones that are shaped in this in this temple every one of us have our place in the temple here and so this is the principle now that we find in the book of Deuteronomy well then if that's true then we can also assume this that Solomon when he sat on the throne he would have wrote this out and Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people saying keep all the commandments which I command you this day and it shall be on the day when he shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee and thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaster them a plaster which is a paint it's a very light paint that they would have painted over that to mark it and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when now are passed over that thou mayst go unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the Lord God of thy father says promise thee so this is a prophecy when you go into the land and they're going to go into the land now under Joshua are gonna be placed in the land there and when you do this this is the way I want you to build this altar and I want you to paint it with this white paint here plaster it with plaster and therefore it shall be verse 4 when you've gone over Jordan that you shall set up these stones which I command you this day and Mount Ebal and thou shalt plaster them a plaster and there there shalt I'll build an altar unto the Lord thy God and altar of stones and thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them so we assume now that Solomon would have read when he wrote out the first five books that he was commanded to write out right so therefore when he says that we're going to have all of these stones come in and all this material come in for the temple we're not going to lift up any iron tool against those stones here in the temple because God wants the work done in the field okay so this is the way now that it was in this is not just a random thing that Solomon says I don't like the noise it makes me nervous had nothing to do with that he was following the inspiration that was given here by Moses before they crossed Jordan and came into the land okay now we find this as well over here in Joshua and Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel to Mount Ebal as Moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of Israel as it is written in the book of the law of Moses an altar of whole stones which are perfect stones over which no man hath lift up any iron so when they cross the river Jordan they took out these stones perfect stones and nobody could work on these stones there where they were building the altar they offered their own burnt offerings unto the Lord and sacrifice peace offerings watch and he wrote there upon the stones they were not shaped now but what God wanted was and what Joshua did he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel so the only thing now that was ever written on the stones of one of God's memorials was his own word God wanted the word itched in stone on this memorial do you understand that and I don't know this is not the River Jordan here but the River Jordan is very small if you've ever seen it and it's surprisingly small but when they came out of the River Jordan and they stacked these twelve stones up one for each tribe of Israel Joshua actually carved on on those stones and it would not have written the entire five books now because I would have taken quite a small chisel and a big stone but he would have written symbols which indicated that this was God's law that was given to the children of Israel by Moses and he wrote that in the presence of the children of Israel so he would have he would have worked on this this stone here and scribed this this is the only thing that God wanted scribed on these stones was his own word are you following me are you thinking spiritual right we don't need to linger long on these types here that in God's process of working with you the only thing he really wants impressed on you that is irreversible and not erasable at all is God's word listen folks when brother Branham held his services the way he did he was doing it a little bit differently than many other ministers and and leaders back in his time Billy Sunday ran his services quite differently if you read the story Billy Sunday and Spurgeon read his services ran his services a little bit differently and Martin Luther certainly did and John Wesley did they all had their own way when brother Branham came along he wanted to simplify these services and he said you know so many just so many songs don't drag it out you don't don't have people get up and talk from the audience just write down to prayer requests and give it out to the people have the song leader control that and you know don't wait don't we read the memory him saying then and and then he says you don't take up your offering don't don't linger you don't need to press the people and shake everybody for $100 bill he said you know just take up the offering and move on he said the important thing is the word he said bring the word out and he says give plenty of time for the word and he didn't want anybody interrupting the service with the gifts you know people jumping up like Pentecost right you know and he set that in order he was you don't want he did then do you have any idea of why brother Branham did it that way I mean he was he seemed like he was very calculated in the way he said his service up but a random said the reason I do this is because the angel told me do it this way that's why he did it because the angel came to him and said when you run your services run them this way you can fire had time I could find you the cold here and brother Branham said that's why I do things the way that I do because this setup is pleasing to the Lord well hey to me that's a good model for us to model ourselves after right this is not about the offering it's not about the singers it's not about the music it's not about the pews it's not about the building it's about the word that comes forth let that be the important part of every service let that be stun my heart not my career not my money not my looks not my youth not anything else let the word be etched on my heart let everything else comes second place to that if there's one thing I'm gonna leave with here let it be the Word of God that's impressed on my heart let it be chisel in my heart and that's the idea that's being conveyed here but remember now this wasn't the the the work was not done in the field this was a temporary altar that they set up as a memorial when they came through in the children of Israel but this idea of not having iron there and that in the church heaven has work done here an iron is a material that normally is used as a weapon whenever they fought enemies and they were able to they were able to confiscate a forge back in those days that was a very precious thing because you needed a Forge to to shape metal weapons lot of stones right out of iron that you iron or that you took out of the ground you needed a forge in order to make yourself weapons of war and so iron is considered a tool or a weapon of war made by man and God didn't want that in Solomon's Temple all right let's go on let's read on now I think so when Solomon built the first temple I'm being repetitive here now he says when he built the first temple it was cut out from all over the world shipped in this is the same quote and it was so masterly built that when the temple went together it had all kinds of little funny-looking stones in it I'm back at that same quote okay and I came back to it for this line but when they began to read the blueprint it was all in the blueprint so all of this work that went on now was not just a loose bunch of activity out there and hoping this thing will fit this blueprint mattered to everybody this mattered everybody because if they didn't do it by the blueprint it had to go back out to the quarry again and it had to be worked on and then it had to be brought back in again now brother Branham talked a lot about this blueprint idea and he talked about the Word of God being the blueprint we know that one time if you if you follow this in the message their brotherly veil was talking with brother Branham late at night there were heaven cornbread and buttermilk late at night and I seen all the non-americans look at that and go horrible and I'm with you there I'm with you there but my wife she looks at me says oh you know that's that's eaten a dragon no but brother Vale and and his sister brother Vale and brother branham were sitting in the kitchen they had cornbread and buttermilk there they sent their wives to bed they were up sitting late and leave al was debating brother branham on baptism and the right way to be baptized and brother branham was going back and forth with him you know when talking about it and brother Vale went to bed and had a dream and the next morning he got up and he said brother branham I had a dream and he said what was the dream about he said well he said I was building this house and this man wanted me to build this fancy nice place for him and I built it and when the man looked around he said no good he said tear it down and build it according to the blueprint he said when it came to the payday he said the man refused to pay he would not he would not accept the work that I had done for him and he said he gave it back to me and said tear it down and do it again and he said brother bill he said I don't want to come down to the river and have it done wrong and he said I can see the blueprint tells me to do it a certain way and brother branham said he said there's water out here let's go do it and they went out and got baptized that morning and leave al was baptized that way now brother branham said many things and you'll be familiar with this here just very briefly in 1965 in the rapture brother Branham was signaling to us here that we're at a corner in the in the dispensation of the Gentiles being near the end and the top of the pyramid here there are lots more turns and critical events than here this went on for a long time these dark ages went on for a long time hundreds and hundreds of years but in the last of it this section here required I mean obviously you had to have a stonemason to lay the foundation of this thing but you had to have a very carefully trained person to get you here everybody was following the pattern and brother Branham had to as well but this required some pretty important navigation if you like in the construction of this building right so brother Branham says we're at a corner in 1965 he says we're at a corner and it's easy a brick mason he turns a corner he said start everybody starts laying down bricks the same way same roll a certain denomination starts and they start rolling down the roll he said it's all right but when you get to them turns he said you got to turn back the other way he says now God is not building a wall he's building a house and there's many cuts and turns that he's predicted here in the Bible and the turns anybody could try to make a turn but it must be according to the blueprint or it's got to be torn down again so when Billy ran him restored baptism and when brother Brandon brought the ordinances in and when brother Branham opened up the seals and saw how how without any any preconceived idea about the seal as a matter of fact all of his preconceived ideas were wrong about the seals he said he was going out with Smith and Larkin and all the other ones there that idea and he was wrong about that so he had no preconceived idea the Holy Spirit came right to him in that room and gave him the understanding of each seal and he saw how it fit with the blueprint the entire blueprint he knew he was on the money he knew he was right and as a matter of fact when he got translated beyond the curtain of time he went over there and said where's Paul and he said Paul's you know what it a little bit of a different place over here and he said but Paul made it yes Paul made it well hey if Paul made it we're gonna make it because we got the same blueprint Paul had the same blueprint that we've got here and a Paul native how can we go wrong if we follow this blueprint and that's why brother Branham couldn't be talked out of the blueprint that God had opened up to him right so this blueprint now becomes very important it's very valuable because all of these workers back in Solomon's day they didn't text and they didn't email they didn't communicate hardly at all because one was in timber and one was in stone and one was in you know different kinds of materials that they had in the temple the the people who shaped the gold and the silver and the vessels and the garments and all of that it all had to be done according to this vision that was initially given there and this blueprint dictated all of it but they were without communication with one another and then it all came together in that one place there and it was all assemble and bang there's that there's the temple of God I mean what a story right what a story I mean you understand saints of God without you know belaboring this point when we get over on the other side and all the body of Christ comes together we're only what 40 people here today or so 30 or 40 people here today but when all the body comes together and you realize we've all been shaped by the same blueprint what are coming together that's gonna be my goodness it'll be a great coming together when you get over there and you see all your friends from Laodicea right the last of the last all the people over there and there's brother Branham with us what uh what an honor that would be to be in over there with brother Branham and I'd like to shake his hand wouldn't you I'm not a brother branham worshiper but I'd like to shake his hand now I just say got to be a wonderful thing to experience you don't be over there with all the all the believers out of Laodicea and then then to realize that's only one seventh of the flock and then to meet all of those people back there and hi you know I got a I got an affinity with Martin Luther all right walked out of the Catholic Church ready to nail something on the board I was telling him you somebody the other day when we went to the rectory up there and wanted to tell the priest that we were leaving the Catholic Church and ready to nail the malachi fort right on the church door you know when we went in we were ready to do that when we came out we were not ready to do that but when we went in we were ready to do that all right I'd like to meet him I in for John Wesley and all those people back here I've been at a place where Columba lived over in Scotland there in the island I love Iona and just there was there's just the amount of work that he did and the supernatural events that took place on that little island and our sorryi rainiest over here is on the Isle of Iona and he would he would train young men to go preach the gospel and they'd go down in Europe and England and all of France and Spain and Portugal and it's travel all over they were trained by Irenaeus and a great work that he did he's a very underscore he's a very under applauded what's that word underrated he's a very underrated messenger we don't hear very much about him he's not as popular as the ones that are here and Paul but he did a tremendous work and when you look at it I was there in the bookstore where the ferry went across to the iron the island and I bought the same book that brother branham read when he made the decision about choosing Iranian instead of Polycarp for this church age messenger and it was no wonder he did just such tremendous things and it was just a blessing to be there there was still a different aura about that Island that was there thousands of years after the fact because of the work that he did it was just absolutely amazing and to meet those saints of God and those people and I mean you think about the Saints but you go back all that way and you've only met a portion of the folks that are gonna be over there imagine meeting David and Solomon Abraham look there's Adam there's Adam and his wife we laugh about it but it will happen one day and we're all gathered over to the other side and then he comes out yeah I mean it's it's just it's hard even it's hard to even think hard even imagine that I is not seen there's not hurt I told you to be simple now watch now just a little side note here I wanted to drop this in here for you in the book the Hebrews series brother Graham said now Paul had an experience and how many believes that experience comes by conversion do you believe that a lot of people believe the opposite of that the opposite of that would be how many believed that conversion comes by experience but that's not what he said if it hasn't I would doubt the conversion the conversion brings experience you can have experiences you can you can listen to some music and get real emotional with it right you can go to a funeral to get real emotional I have an emotional experience but doesn't mean you're converted I was telling the church the other day I probably I knew I shouldn't have told him this but I had never heard the end of it but I was coming down the road one Sunday morning early by myself and I was listening to a focus on the family you know wit's end of interest and Odyssey and mr. Whitaker was going back and telling about how he wife died and how she had the disease and everything else and I got all emotional just listen to it and I got to thinking about sister Becky and what would happen if she died and I was just a wreck I I had I had a real experience coming down in the car I didn't get converted but you know you can have experiences right you've all been in churches where I mean you know the real dynamic experiences you know and you feel the goosebumps on your back we've all had experiences like that that doesn't mean you're converted there's lots of people that were sinners when they went into services like that and sinners when they came out so brother brands not saying that that that conversion the conversion comes by experience but experience comes by conversion watch now if it hasn't he said I doubt the conversion and the conversion brings experience and you can't allot it to anything now sometimes it might be shouting sometimes it might be speaking in tongues sometimes it might be weeping sometimes it might be groaning right your conversion would have had some element to it where you reacted to the presence of God but we don't necessarily have to all have the same experience right I've never spoken in tongues I felt like at a time or two but I've never actually spoken in tongues that doesn't make me not convert it I'm sure that you'd say man if you want to I'm sure that you don't know what it is so don't try to lot it you understand what he's saying now don't you try to impose that anybody that you've got a you got a laugh in the spirit you got to speak in tongues in order to be converted or you got to do a certain thing here you don't know what it is so don't try it a lot of because every one of you has proved to be wrong in it you Methodists and Baptists in your Nazarenes and Pentecostals whenever men tried to do that they were wrong in it just like the Pentecostals saying that you have the Holy Ghost only when you've spoken in tongues right that's what they believed a lot of Pentecostals went to their grave believing that but it wasn't the initial evidence it was an experience but it was not it was not the true baptism of the Holy Spirit are you okay with that don't get quiet on me folks I know I'm talking about you understand what he's saying now you've got to make sure that you separate an experience from the conversion because the conversions going to bring you back to same into every word right a real conversions of New Birth it's going to bring you back to air to say a name in every word to believe in the word for your day walking in the light as he's in the light but you can have a lot of experiences along the way can have experiences before and after a new birth and in the new birth but remember now the key is the conversion not the experience are we okay he said I've seen people shout just as hard as they could shout and steal the gold of your teeth I've seen people speak with tongues like pouring peas on a dry cowhide and honest-to-goodness they chewed tobacco on the other side of the mouth and cut their throat if they could do it were they people who had an experience yes sir where they converted no sir you understand what he's saying now all right so let's look at this now the reason I bring this in when it comes to adoption we know adoption is the placing of a believer right the conversion of a believer is one thing the maturing and the placing of a believer is another thing and that takes place over time that's a learning how the father's way of things is that's it learning the father's way and he says what is adoption adoption is not your new birth it is not your birth your adoption is you are placing when we are born of the Spirit of God we are sons of God we were predestinated now this is what hurts Pentecostals a little they say well I got born again praise the Lord got the Holy Ghost fine you're a child of God that's right but yet that ain't what I'm talking about because he's in the adoption series now this is the series he's talking about see you were predestinated unto adoption and adoption is placing a son so remember now we're the Pentecostal people and he knew this was like nails on the chalkboard of the Pentecostal people because let me tell you something about Brandon tabernacle in brother Graham's early years when brother Branham had the prayer lines he did in Branham tabernacle and he'd leave the building they would have the people who come and take the service after him would have people come up and speak in tongues at the altar and they trained him to speak in tongues at the altar because they still believed that was the only evidence of the Holy Spirit and they did that because brother Branham left the building and yeah I can show you a coach where brother Bantam came back and corrected that in his own church and even brother Neville over that because they were placing the experience ahead of the conversion and what was brother Branham there to do he was there to bring this adoption ministry to place us in the word for our day not another day are we okay here we had a Joshua type ministry to place us in the word hey listen say to God if it wasn't for adoption in your life you'd still be back believing other things of another era but God placed us in this in this word he placed us in this time now where we have the light that we have and you are predestinated unto adoption so in other words there's a birth there's a birth over here and then there's a placing of this son and there's a lot that goes on between here and there right and one day you're going to be taken and you're going to be placed in that eternal house in that eternal Tabernacle over there on the other side but over there God won't say wow that guy's still got an attitude he's still got a lot of pride we're gonna have to get the belt sander out and work on there'll be none of that over there all of that is done here are we okay all of that is done here and those are experiences that we have along the way but you don't have those kinds of experiences until there's a conversion first then God's interested in making you v some where are we okay this is important folks these walls are gonna be able you'll see now in in 1963 brother Branham said what good is stones if you don't have a true stonemason and with a good sharp tool is to shape him into fitting into the fitting place in the house of God what's the good of a stone if you know somebody who knows what the blueprint says and how to shape it you're just piling up a bunch of rocks it isn't doing a bit of good see that's right that's the people and while goodness is that to come to church if the stonemason is there that'll shape that and make them quit this and that and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like Christians and sets in the house of God with signs following the believers what do you got you got a bunch of church right a bunch of churchgoers a bunch of church rocks that's in time evangelism well come on folks and we think of evangelism this is how we define it I got to get out of these lights I'll be able to see for a week the when we think of evangelism we think of somebody pulling on the people in denominational circles now do you think of them pulling on the people that come to the altar to make a decision that's going to determine their eternal destination right that's that's not how we think of it but that's how the world a church world thinks of evangelism they bring in an evangelist just shake everybody up and get them up to the altar and make a decision and that's going to determine where they go you know give your heart to the Lord you'll go to heaven you don't keep your heart to the Lord you're gonna go to hell and the decisions made right here come on you know mom did it dad did it why don't you do it come on up here and they have everybody come to the altar right that's all-time evangelism now in their season that was all right but that's not endtime evangelism that's not what brother Branham did when brother manum came and preached in time evangelism and I can show you in the sermon brother Branham did this he had everybody turn around and look at the Lamb's Book of Life and he said if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life your destiny is already sealed your origin becomes your destiny right and run around keep talking about the Lamb's Book of Life and he talks about how the fact that you know one day you're recognized you're not just the son of Frank and Betty coffee but you're a son of God you always were he said it began that day he said your realization of it began at the altar but you always were a son of God right and so brother man I've had everybody looks that way at the Lamb's Book of Life and realize if I'm there I'm gonna identify with the mystery of my day right and come into the light of the hour but a heaven experience I had this conversion time right here at an altar at his church service when I realize that I'm more than just a son of my parents I'm a son of God and if I was the son of God I was back there and I'm back there that up there is already settled I didn't decide it God decided it a long time ago right and then brother branham said this this kind of evangelism this endtime evangelism is also identified by he said that stonemason cutting you and and shaping you and molding you and squaring you up with the word now let me tell you something brother Jarrell will identify with this there's a statement where if I had it I should have brought it brother Branham said people are gonna do what they're gonna do it was an awfully true statement people are gonna do what they're gonna do and you know what as much as I preached in as much as I labor in as much as you study and sweat and give it out to people and turn red in the face and all of that people still go do what they're gonna do it's an amazing thing you wonder huh you know what else are you supposed to do what ministry can you bring in what way can you can you present it to people because you got to realize this it isn't me shaping the people the Holy Spirit's got to do it and in order for the Holy Spirit to do it there's got to be a certain amount of surrender in their life to say Lord you look at me honestly you show me myself in the perfect law of Liberty which is like a mirror and let me see myself and and help me to change until the people come to that place people are gonna do what they want to do you can pre-sell you're blue in the face I'll tell you that because I am limited and how much I can shape the people and how much I can I can you know if I impose things on the people you're only gonna find a way to get around that they're only gonna find a way to get around that in time if they don't have the Holy Spirit if they've never surrendered to the Holy Spirit they're gonna find a way to get around that you remember there was a certain brother who came to our church years ago whose wife is still serving the Lord and he was in a Bible College and they had built a fence around that Bible College to keep the students in because they were not allowed they had curfews and they had to be in the hand of building you know at certain periods of time and he said we didn't do it he says you know we didn't have the Holy Ghost back then and he said we just found a way to dig underneath the fence and go out because without the Holy Ghost the rules don't really all you're doing is finding a way to get around him it's this just challenge to get around these rules that are there what brother Branham is telling us right here is that endtime evangelism the whole ministry the end time is not only to pull the loose ends together and to open up the seals and so forth but to listen to effectively shape you by the preaching of the word the washing of the water by the word it isn't just to have the seals but it is to have the effect of that open word affect you to shape you and mold you in a way that no other age has been shaped because we've got a word that no other ages have and we are the last part of this thing the capstone people and we are the people that have you know the the the the the the finest work compared to all the other work not that our messages is more eternal than theirs or we've got more eternal life they're all just as eternal as we are but no other age saw what we have seen in this last time and so therefore I believe there's a greater element of of molding and shaping as brother Graham says right here that's what that's what any time evangelism is because God had to take us in a lifetime in this last day from something that looked like this to something look like this in type right God God looked at this and he said I can make something out of that just a pile of dirt he looked at that he said oh that's that's grandness that's hard old stuff stubborn as a mule I can make something out of that I I can I can do it my leg just give me time give me time and I can make something really beautiful and that's what God did didn't he come on folks think about where you are I could bring the pictures I could show you my pictures or when I go got ahold of me now think about this think about this all of you that are going back memory lane come on back now come on back now I could show you the pictures I've showed that picture to my church and they still don't believe that's me they still don't believe that's me now think about it this way all right you kids now watch this when God called you out of here all right when God called you from here he took you from the world and once he called you you didn't fit in other words when God blasted you out of the world you were in you didn't fit anymore here but when God called you out she certainly didn't fit in in this place over here right that old stone that fell out of the side of the mountain over here had to be worked on until it found its place over here I mean this was not fit to enter in when I came in I wasn't fit to find my place over there in that eternal house no sir because remember now we are we are part of an eternal house right eternal temple eternal Kingdom this was a natural this was a natural phenomenon right but but we we know that that's this body it's not our destiny God's got a eternal house for us on the other side and we're part of an eternal Kingdom on this side over here right God's got a house for us got his address for us we are predestinated unto that God's got a place over here for us but when we came out we were not fit to enter into there we had to go through a whole lot of things here friends were shucked off dress codes were shucked off we had attitudes we had language we had all kinds of things that had to go here styles that had to go right and all kinds of things that had to drop off drop off drop off it was a new that was making those decisions it was those 70,000 stone quarry workers that were there working on us all the way through there and bringing a sermon after sermon after sermon and you say Lord whatever it takes and he'd send that stone quarry worker in there and they'd work you over a little bit and you do you come away I thank God I got delivered other than you know when you listen to him working on those stones now let me let me illustrate it this way the moment God called you you don't fit there anymore and you don't fit there you're an oddball alright you are an oddball because all this way here you don't you don't fit anywhere you don't fit in in this journey folks we don't fit in we don't blend with the world right they do things they listen to things they enjoy things they watch things that we don't watch and we don't fit in with and we have trouble fitting in with them all along this journey the only other people that we can relate to from here to here are the other stones that are being worked on - [Music] you're the only people that understand me you're the only people that would understand why we would get excited about a message that God sent through a prophet back here who we refer to as a prophet most people have no idea what that even means but do you understand what I'm going through and when we see a brother going through a difficulty or a trial and gods shaping him and molding him you know exactly what's going on God's dealing with his heart God dealing with his life God's dealing with his family we can relate to that because we're the ones who are going through that as well right we have sympathy we have empathy we know how to pray for people who are going through difficulties and trials and and ill-health and all the rest of it we understand those principles because we've been trained in this adoption process all of these years here and the people out in the world say why don't they say to us why don't you quit why don't you just give it up and go there's lots of other churches why don't you just give it up and take the easier path they don't relate to us we don't relate to them the only people who understand this language at all is the people who are going through the same thing and you don't fit anywhere you don't fit anywhere you matter of fact the moment God starts working on you can't go back there you can't go back into that old mountain again right you can't the last thing in the world once you get an idea that it is God who's actually doing this and God has called you you don't want to go back to there you don't want to go back to the slime pits of the world you don't want to go back to the glory of the word you don't want to go back to that could you if you could I got to preach differently but I mean I don't think there's any of you that would want to go back to the world again and and and live that way that we were in the world because as soon as you come in God gives you a glimpse of the eternal he lets you know certain promises there and and and it gives you the baptism of the Holy Spirit and all of a sudden things begin to be illuminated in your heart that you never knew I is not seen and all of a sudden you're beginning to realize God's got an eternity waiting for me he's got a better body waiting for me my loved ones are on the other side we sorrow not as those which have no hope we believe we're gonna see them again over on the other side isn't that right the whole world going into darkness and God has pulled us out of it the whole world plunging towards tribulation and here they are building stores and malls and digging for oil and everything else and I'm looking at it and saying who cares I mean it's great because you got more choices in stores but you know what at the end of it you you spend your money anyway right it's a rat race to me there's no satisfaction in those things anymore now for people in the world I mean they they gain satisfaction by heaven you know things and stuff and all the rest of it but for me that's not my chief joy God has put a chief joy in my heart that's different than the things of the world things of the world and the only people that can really relate to that is the people who are going through the same thing hang on brother Graham said stones are like decisions confessions blessed are thought Peter upon this rock and all year he said we have decisions those stones confessions or good as a stone without a stonemason and the sharp Word of God to cut him into a son of God or a daughter of God and place him in the church where he belongs what good is that for whom the Lord loveth each a sinner and he scourgeth every son whom he receives God receives you begins to work on you and if you endure this chastening God dealeth with you as sons that's that adoption process isn't it for what son is he whom the father Jason is not for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that he might be partakers of his holiness now God is not making a square on the on the edges but this is what he's doing that word chastened means the whole training and education of children which relates to the cultivation of your mind and morals and with that comes reproofs and punishments so that's the word now that paul chooses to use there it also includes the training in care of the body so as parents now we can relate to this because we're always trying to sculpt and mold and shape the thinking of our children basically to our values to the things that we feel are important if they don't need to watch a certain thing we're gonna prevent that if they do need to participate in a certain thing we're gonna promote that right that's what we're going to do and and so therefore it's the whole training of children so Paul is saying that the way God looks at us is as is luck he's got a bunch of recruits and he's going to work with us to shape our thinking and cause us to think differently about things than anyone else's children because we're gonna be shaped by God's values and God's Way of thinking right like a parent would shape the thinking of their children or try to and God is going to shape our thinking according to his way and his way is found in his word right that makes sense whatever in adults also cultivates the soul by correcting mistakes and curbing passions instruction which aims at increasing virtue this would be a self-evident question but how many of you have ever done anything wrong and felt checked by it you know maybe you went to the wrong place on the internet or maybe you know a little white lie or maybe achieved a little on your taxes or whatever else and whatever you did all of a sudden there's a there's a conviction there there's a hesitate patien there and you know what you really ought to be thanking God for that because it's the thing that curbs you it's the things that cultivates the passion to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing because if you didn't have that you'd carry on in the error of your own ways and the worst thing that could happen to you is that God would turn you over to your own ways that's the worst thing that could happen to you but God constantly checks us and brings us back you know what he's doing he's doing it like a father would do his children to cultivate certain good things there and caused that to be strong so that it would overwhelm the weak I down in our down in our place in Virginia there when we moved in there we we bought a portion of a pasture our neighborhood was a pasture so there was pasture grass in the pasture obviously and in a pasture there's all kinds of grasses that grow there and I every spring I'd look at it you know with the boys and we'd be out there except Andrew he wouldn't be there but the other boys would be we'd be looking at it'd be all kinds of weeds and I said guys we're gonna have to pull these weeds we're gonna have to get some weed killer and we're gonna have to spread this out and you know so they every year we try to go at it we try to kill all the weeds and finally I found somebody who knew what they were talking about and I asked him I said how in the world we deal with this let's do a soil sample and see what the soil is actually looking like and so they did that and so on and he finally he told me he said you're wasting your time trying to kill all these weeds he said you'll never do it because as soon as you kill him there'll be other weeds from your neighbor's over here they're sitting on the same grass you were on and there's just gonna blow in here and you're gonna grow more weeds again he said this it's a waste of time he said that's not the way to go about this and I said well pray tell what is and he said feed the grass he said if you feed the grass he said the grass will grow strong enough it'll take everything over and choke out all those weeds he said don't worry about trying to kill everything he said just feed that feed that grass he said just just watch that it'll just it'll just push everything else out and take over because grass is in the senses is a weed it's just a we do we like and we've named it something you know and we've kind of we like it that's all but he said if you let it go it just looks like a weed like all the rest of it you can't tell it apart but he said die if I were you he said I just feed the grass just just do that don't worry about anything else and we did and you know what it worked now we have a beautiful lawn years later we have a beautiful lawn because we fed the grass and that grass just kind of did what he said I just pushed everything out it and and its strong the grass is strong it is rooted in there and it's strong in other words let me let me apply it this way feed that inner man and let that become strong and push out a lot of that other stuff that doesn't belong there you can be legalistic and say well I'm not gonna do this I'm not gonna do that and thou shalt not do this now it's kids you shall not do - hey you're better off giving your kids a love for the gospel instead of a bunch of restrictions from the things of the world because jesus said if you love me you will keep my Commandments it's not rules and regulations it's if you love me you keep my Commandments and when you give your children you cultivate a love for the gospel and the things of God and and you you encourage them to do the right things and let go of the wrong things and make your priorities right seek first the kingdom of God when you begin to cultivate that in children let me tell you over time they begin to recognize things when they're wrong when they pop up and they're not they don't belong there they're more easily identifiable right and in your own life the same thing is true that when you feed that inner man I mean you're strong and when you're prey and when you seek God in your app church and they're right you had to write openness in church when the wrong thing pops up in your life gets evident right away you know you've crossed a line you know you've grieved the Holy Spirit that doesn't come by accident that comes because you fed the grass you feed the inner man in your life and it will it will cultivate the right thing in your life now that's exactly what Paul is you that's the term I said all that about the grass because that's the term he's using right here every son who he whom the Lord loveth he chasing it he caught he's always cultivating something in your life he's wanting to bring out the right things in your life an adoption brother branham said and I say unto thee thou art Peter I'm the great rock I'm the cornerstone he says but you are the little that's placed upon me and the builders chose you you never chose yourself and the angels of God one night working in the quarry called you out and you submitted yourself to me and I cut you in my own fashion I made you the way I wanted you to be I done the sawing you just stood still and I placed you now as a little stone to fit in with some other stone to lead that stone and this stone leaves that stone and that stone and the cement of love is bringing you together making the foundation which I am to be fitted together with every stone that professes my name and receives this revelation and upon this rock the revelation of God that will stand still and be cut to stone by revelation I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and now dear father but he says if there be any of your children that have been blasted with the gospel from the quarry of life all of us have right blasted from the world with the gospel out of the quarry of life what a statement and desire to so make them and been cutting on them this morning hewing them sawing off their habits and their evil thinking and their backbiting and their backslidings and now you want to place them again and fit them into the building will you speak to their hearts just now you understand when you say brother has put himself right into that he's a lively stone he's one that he's one that's being built up you know because of of the work of the Holy Spirit don't you agree that that God and those stonemasons worked on brother around remember that remember those experiences he had never in any other race if we ever get a window into the life of a prophet and the molding of a prophet until this last age when brother Branham came on the scene in first Kings at first Kings chapter 17 the Bible says and Elisha came out and called for a drought that's all we know we don't know anything about the preliminary life of Elisha we don't know what he went to we don't know what school he went to we don't know whether he shot six boys with a gun right we don't know about whether he was poor or rich we don't know where Tishbite what a tishbite is any of you know what a douche plate is if you know tell me afterwards no I we have never found what the word tishbite means but Elijah was a tishbite some say it was a hairy man he was a bearded man some savings from the place called tisha but we really don't know we know very little about the beginning of Elijah of all the sudden a fall comes on the scene right and we think well he's a prophet all the time but in this age God lets you see a prophet from his birth and a pillar fire comes right in the window there at his birth even when brother bran is not making any decisions right and then carrying water and the whirlwind comes and he's do you know guiding and cultivating brother Branham don't smoke her drink her to find your body in any way right and God's shaping that man brother man said well I'll be a man you know far be it from her Brandon not to drink and he tries to drink and that sound comes you know that whirling comes in what's called doing he's chastening this prophet right and then brother Graham so angry he takes his gun he hides by the side of the road these boys had come by he's gonna he shoot six times at the and the gun doesn't go off and they run down the road he shoots again six times and the gun goes off six times what was God doing guarding that man he was chasing that man and we see all of those events and those experiences from when God called them to where he actually was placed in the body and we find that shaping and it molding and all of that that went on in his life saints of God God allowed us to look in that window of his life and see how God dealt with the Prophet and if God would deal with a prophet why do you think that God wouldn't be dealing with you and God would allow you to go through certain things because he's shaping you from here to where you eventually fit in I said it before I'll say it again that out here we just talk about what it's going to be like over there in that place over yonder but one day you'll fit right in and I mean nobody arguing with it there'll be no websites over there that are contrary to the message I mean nobody nobody trying to say well the bridge didn't go up and abrade they didn't die on the bridge and all their all the other garbage that's out there there'll be none of that over there it'll all come together in the one unit and in Solomon's Temple the pillar of fire was the center it was a center of attraction in that building when that cloud came in there that was the center of attraction everybody else kind of had to step back and he he became the center of that whole thing imagine now today air and we have service you know it's it's a different atmosphere different atmosphere now to when we begin you know what's that different atmosphere now when they right right now then when we started when I walked in here I knew it was right I knew his right place I knew I wasn't supposed to be where I was supposed to be and I figured you you did to us why you came but there's just something about getting together with God's people and talking about God's Word it just brings an atmosphere that nothing else does but you know what we go right back out tomorrow we go back out in the world and your labor and you're working and you're you know you're mixing with people who are buying lottery tickets and there one there wondering what the you know the latest hockey score was and all the rest of it and they're they're passionate about Tim Hortons imagine me and passionate about something Tim Hortons and they're out there in the world and they look at those things as being all they're wonderful things in here yeah I kind of wish I was back there in yesterday forever I mean that's really at the end of the day what's the good of the rest of it I'd rather be in this presence greater forever I got loved ones on the other side you some of you got loved ones on the other side I got people I want to meet on the other side I got people I want to see real quick when I get over in the other side I want to go I know right where I'm going when I got on the other side I'll buy you I got people I want to see but over here we just don't fit in we don't fit anymore we don't fit back there and God hasn't allowed us to be fit back in in that Kingdom yet but he's still working on me and over time we just come closer and closer and one day we'll just be gone let's stay in raphy one day we'll be gone prepare that work build a house prepare thy work build my house God took a lot of planning God he instructed Solomon on how to do this and he give Solomon wisdom in order how to do this you get all these people all over this all over the countryside here fine people are skilled and let them do what they do it's like God God said all over the world he says I'm gonna give gifts to the people I'm gonna give prophets teachers evangelists pastors and so on and they're gonna preach the gospel and that gospel will work on those people and it'll shape them and mold them and change them it won't be the won't be the preacher that does it it'll be the gospel he preaches that works in the hearts of the people a very important distinction we don't want to all be little brother Gerald's because if we all weren't meant to be little brother Gerald's sister Betty would have had 40 or 50 kids but that's not wasn't God's intent that's not God's intent God's intent was is that we could come together under a word in Africa and Canada in the US or Europe wherever wherever it is and be all molded by the same blueprint so we could all find our unique place in God's kingdom you're not being shaped and molded to live here you're not being shaped for here you're being shaped for the money you're being shaped for the wedding supper you're being shaped for another Kingdom altogether you're not being prepared to live here matter of fact the way we live here is not going to guarantee prosperity and success here I mean the first thing we give away a tenth part of our income who else does that all right it's only a fanatical few give away the first part of their income most people work to keep all their income right and make it more make it bigger we just do things differently and the way things are structured we'll never be successful like the wicked of the world will never be God's got us on a different path and you're being molded not to live here you're being molded to live somewhere else understanding that process to me helps that helps be it unto me according to your word according to your promises I can stand assured I think that'll be our when those people went in that temple that day with Solomon and they're all standing there and they were offering those goats it must have been looking upward they must have been looking around and just saying what will God's reaction be to our place what will gods reaction be to our worship what will God's reaction be to these sacrifices that we make and they must have been looking I'm wondering will he come will he speak to us will he visit us today and they're going through what they needed to do hoping that God would do the rest I doubt to be our attitude when we come to this building here may it be a dedicated place for God's work God's people but every service you ought to be looking heavenward and saying Lord forgive me for what I didn't do and Lord just help me line up with your word but I'm glad brother Gerald's here and I'm glad sister Maureen's here to play the organ I'm glad everybody else is here but Lord we need you to come on the scene now I'm looking heavenward to see if you'd come on because

Lord Jesus write these things upon my heart and Lord we might not be just hearers of the word but doers of the word as well as permanently Lord as you had joshua mark those words those Commandments on

God in the hour that we're living in Lord that's difficult in the world we face in the world that surrounds us but Lord Jesus we are meant to be and called to be overcomers and I pray dear God you'd
