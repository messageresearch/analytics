praying your grace for each one that's not here Lord praying you'll just minister to them as well Lord those that are online watching Lord we pray your special touch to them as well in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians chap CH 4 Ephesians chapter 4 amen somebody asked me they said are you done with stature of a perfect man brother John I said no because we're on the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost has so many things for us and means so many things for us and it does so many things for us that I said we're probably going to be on this one a little bit this idea of Charity this Divine love this a agape love which is Christ himself amen but we want to take a a different look at this tonight and a bit of a different angle than what we've been looking at perhaps amen so Ephesians chap 4 verse 22 amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening amen it's good to be in a warm building when it's cold and windy and snow it seems it's a little early amen I don't know who to blame but there's somebody out there I think so we ought to draw straws maybe like Jonah amen Ephesians 4:22 it's good to be here that you put off Paul says concerning the former conversation the former life the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness if there's a new man that means there's an old man amen and if there's a a spirit that's renewed it means there was a spirit that there that you had before this began there was something you're coming back to so there's a new man and there's a renewing of the spirit of your mind he says wherefore for putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another he said and be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil that means don't give Satan an opportunity don't give him a chance don't give him a conversation don't give him the time of day don't let him dwell in your thoughts don't let them dwell in your life don't let them dwell in your habits don't open the door he says let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying I believe if we did that every day it' change our conversations that everything we say would be good to the use of edifying edify means to build up he says that it may minister grace to the hearers he says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and as I said we're turning it into a bit of a different thing we we spoke on the uh we we had a three-part series there that we just finished on coming into Perfection and now I want to talk this evening on the Seal of your soul amen the Seal of your soul and we've talked about this attribute of charity now for a few services and so we ought to know what it is by now and I don't want to cover that but I I I want to talk about what it means when we get the Holy Ghost what is God doing what is it signifying and and we've taught on this a little bit before and that's that we are a Triune being brother brandham Tau the scripture teaches us that and on the very inside of the inside we have a soul and then outside of that we have a spirit and then outside of that we have a body we've got three different Realms and we know that there's a battle between God and Satan for the the the control of all three that's what they're looking for they're looking for control in their lives and it's a battle between good and evil amen and and we've got these different areas and and brother BR would say that God took the soul and then he says but the devil took the Mind amen and he said brother BR would say and this is something that'll help certainly the young people perhaps but all of us brother BR would say the Temptation we face is not in your soul when once you get the Holy Ghost the Temptation is in your flesh it's in your spirit it's outside of the soul the soul has made its decision brother bam says you got a free will free moral agency to choose who comes into your life and when you receive the Holy Ghost it's because you've made your choice and he's accepted it and he's come in and he's received what you've done but the spirit he says is our worldly nature he says and that is unredeemed there there's nothing good in it it's a beast nature and so the spirit is at war with the soul as long as you've got the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost your soul and your spirit get along just fine because there's nobody in your soul at that point it's it's a place where things can come and go and reside and if God's not there then you're there that's the way it goes because remember what lives in the soul is the control tower that's the control tower for the believer so whoever's in there is the one that controls your life and if Christ is not in there that means that it's self-will that's there it means that you haven't died out to yourself so that he can come in amen but the Temptation that we get after the Holy Ghost is in our spirit and our in our flesh realm but brother R would say this he said in the Garden of Eden God and the devil chose their part of the man the devil took his head and God took his heart that would be his soul he said the devil tries to show him with his mental power some great something he can do Devil's trying to empower you with what you've got he says and he only wants to see with his eyes what he can see but God come in his heart and makes him believe for things he cannot see he Calles the scripture for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen he just believes it it's an amazing thing when you see somebody that first comes to the Lord and certainly we can probably think back to our original conversions and you believe things and you don't even know why you believe it why because there's something inside of you that's connecting with what you're hearing and with what you're seeing and with what you're reading you believe it because there's something on the inside that says that's me that it identifies with that he says so he just believes it because God said it he doesn't have to see nothing or no sense of his body has to declare it he just believes it in his soul where God lives that's a supernatural thing he says but the devil took his head and makes him smart figures himself out of religion a way of Escape it never works and yet men keep trying it men keep trying a new religion a new way a new technology a new process a new mental conception whatever it might be men keep trying it and yet they never Escape they never do I was talking to someone the other day we were talking about the The Temptations of the ministry and it seems like every week you hear of another Minister folling I'm not speaking about the message but I'm speaking in general because they've made a religion and they're trying to escape and they're trying to make a way and they themselves are captive and you can't free somebody if you're in captivity and you you see a falling and a falling and a falling because all they've got is religion they don't have Christ he says he figures himself out of religion a way of Escape but God wants to lead him to the path of worship not not not something you can do but bring you to a place where you recognize the god that makes all things possible Amen brother B would say the soul is the nature of the spirit that means it matters who's in control of the soul that means it matters who's in there amen The Anchor Point for the Believers the soul and that's the true control tower for us once we receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit but until then all the gates are open all the access points are open and any influence that's out there potentially can control you it can come in through your mind it can come through your conscience it can come through your memories it can come through your five outer senses the five inner senses whatever it is but Satan's access point is primarily through your mind and God's access is through your soul or through your heart and whichever one you listen to is the one that will determine the outcome it's very simple we make a choice every day as to what our condition's going to be in that day and in that situation and in these circumstances amen we read the the scripture last service that said we were born by the word of Truth and that means we're Eternal with the word of God and God's trying to get us back to that eternity that we came from that's the entire process of this but like I said the condition in which we leave this world the condition in which we live through this world is determined on what's controlling us for that day now your soul is sealed Paul said it's sealed to the day of redemption amen that's the that's the the day of the Resurrection that's the day of the Rapture that's sealed but everything else is now in a battle for who's going to control it the soul is sealed but your mind's not sealed so Paul said we've got to take on the mind of Christ and Paul said I Die daily there's something that's going all day every day and there's a battle there that's for control of our life but there's an eternal bit inside of us and when that's sealed it's a finished work work and we'll talk about that a little bit more this evening but everyday battle for the believer is this battle now between what's on the inside and everything else and sometimes what beats us up as Believers is that we sit there and we we have a a trial In the Flesh and we think that means we don't have the Holy Ghost no that just means you're human that just means you still have a fallen body amen but the fact that there's a battle means there's something on the inside that doesn't want to do what the flesh wants you to do and sometimes the fact that there's a battle is the greatest sign that you do have the Holy Ghost cuz nobody else is fighting what you're fighting amen but we covered this back in 2022 I had to look through my slides and notes but there's a gate that's between our soul and our spirit I'm sorry it's a little hard to maybe see there that's the coloration but you've got your soul on the inside and that's that's your your control tower for the believer and that's sealed by the holy spirit amen but everything outside of that is not sealed everything outside of that is not redeemed every bit outside of that is open to access points and we went through how brother Bram said that the mind is the gate to the spirit and it's the gate to the soul but once the soul is sealed it's a one-way gate you can't go into the soul anymore it's sealed but what's inside the gate can come out what's inside this the the the soul can come out and what's in there is what it's the word it's Faith it's love it's life it's light it's all of these things and so you have to push what's in your soul through the mind to get to your soul and your body or your spirit and your body or you have to bypass it and really that's what faith does is Faith bypasses the mind the the natural way of thinking and it goes and it it impacts directly on the on the on the spirit and on your body remember brother brandom said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass why because what's in your soul is the holy spirit what's in your your soul is Faith is life and so when you go into your mind and you say I'm going to believe what the word says I'm going to confess what the holy spirit says inside of me then it bypasses and pushes away all doubt all thoughts all senses whatever it is and it says I'm going to be subject to the word of God now that can go into your into your spirit now that can be brought under control and all your memories and your conscience and these different things can be brought subject to the word and then when that's brought subject then it can ignore your five senses and it brings them under control and now the whole body is now under what subjection to the Holy Spirit Spirit subjection to the word of God but you've got to choose where that's going to go how that's going to go it never changes your soul but it changes how you go through day today in your life Amen brother BR would say or or job would say the thing that I greatly feared has come upon me and that of which I was afraid has come to me you watch what you're thinking and you definitely watch what you're saying because what you confess has access to you if you say I'm an no good believer guess what Satan has every access point to drive home to you that you're a no good believer if you say I'm sick he has every right to make you sick if you say I'm poor he has every right to make you poor if you say I don't have faith then he has every right to attack your faith every access point you give him will be through what the way you think and you've got to lock that out by the word of God and say I'm G to believe the word I'm not going to believe what anything else says you decide what happens so many times think right by putting a word filter on your thoughts and that'll change your your words that'll change your attitude and that'll change your body literal healing comes from inside brother B just says you're just letting the Holy Ghost do the work that it's supposed to do CU When you get the Holy Ghost you get everything that was in Christ you get Deliverance you get healing you get provision you get blessing you get joy peace rest all those things and all you're doing is saying I'm going to let what he put in me I'm going to let him in me take effect in my life and you do it by the way that you think and the thoughts that you think and what you bring your thoughts subject to in your life amen we control those things we have free moral agency as to what we're going to dwell on in our life and what we're going to say Amen but this soul is the parts that sealed and everything else is a battle to let what's inside of you have control and that's every day we'll never get out of it we'll never get out of it as far as I know because we're always going to be in this body that's imperfect until the day of our Redemption until until the day we pass from this life into the next one but listen to this brother bam says God has a new birth for you God has a new birth for you remember what Peter said in Acts 2 he said for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call brother I'm saying everyone that hears the word that is a real believer has a new birth that's waiting for them God has a new birth for you he says but listen to his still Small Voice every one of you people who profess to be Christians get yourself quiet before him don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing just go before him get up in the woods somewhere get out on the side of the road go into the secret closet and close the door he said when the kids go to school there get down on your knees he's leaving no excuse for us he's saying if you want the Holy Ghost if you want the new birth you let God know and don't let anything hold you back he says you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere but just get down and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up he says it'll change you it'll make you different like it did this little Samuel he's talking about the still Small Voice that Samuel heard he says it'll do something to you if you'll just do it you got to let God know you got to let God no I want the Holy Ghost Lord I want you in my soul I want you in my life I want you to have complete control I want to be changed he says now it'll make you what you should be it'll make you the kind of Christian you ought to be I was just listening this this week and to to God is uh hid God hidden in Simplicity and revealed in the same and brother Bram said God can give you the holy ghost at any time you say well brother John it says repent and be baptized all I can say is in Acts while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard his words what brother bam says it's based on the condition of your heart that's it so while we've been preaching all of this about the the stature of a perfect man and the attributes in the end God knows what's in there and he'll give you the Holy Ghost when what's in there lines up with what he expects out of your life and he can do that at any time it's not for me to tell you when you got it it's not for me to tell you if you got it but you go to him and you lay yourself be before him we'll read some quotes about it in a minute you lay yourself you surrender you truly repent God is obligated to give you the Holy Ghost he can give it to you at any time he can give it to you in this service he can give it to you while you're driving down the road he can do it while you're kneeling by your bed he can do it while you're listening to music you could be doing anything and if your heart is on him I believe he can come down and give you the Holy Ghost brother Bram saying the same thing he says it'll make you the kind of Christian that you ought to be but I will say this as I've been studying this over the last few months there's one thing I came to realize and it's not that I didn't realize it before but it's that there are many people that think they have the Holy Ghost that don't have the Holy Ghost and I believe part of that is because of message culture because we've we've gotten to this point where we say well if you recognize a prophet for this and you believe his message you have the Holy Ghost and Jesus never said that Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them not by the fact that they attend church God's not looking for people to warm pews with their rear ends that's not the goal is to put rear ends in the seats it's to put living creatures that reflect Christ on this Earth amen so the more you get into this and and the more I study and I only bring the high points really and maybe that sounds scary that I'm only bringing the high points but I try and find you know the the most perfect quotes and the most perfect scriptures to to bring together these thoughts but the more you read and brother random gets into details and I'm not going to go specific with it tonight by any means but he gets into things and he says if you got this in your life and you're doing it you can't have the Holy Ghost and do those things you can't be certain ways and have the Holy Ghost he says it's impossible that that nature doesn't work that's not the Holy Ghost it can't be the Holy Ghost you need something greater than what you've got don't throw away what you've got but we may have exactly what we think we do brother BR puts it this way remember because we read the quote last service where he said you were one thing and now you're a different thing and it's a completely different thing and people know that you've been with Jesus they know there's been a change he says you thinking you have it and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but he said unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it and we know what we are I say that by we know what's on the inside we see what nobody else sees we know what's going on when nobody else knows what's going on people can't read our thoughts but we know what's going on on the inside he says but no matter how many emotions how much you jump run Sensations speakings in tongues or shouting or whatever you might lay it upon it's all right I believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it cuz the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them so I think that's why Peter said you know in in second Peter 1 in that stature of a perfect man after he reads through all or he lists all of these Seven Virtues and then he adds in charity he says for if these things be in you Faith virtue knowledge and such and the Holy Ghost and abound so not just a bit abounding means super abundant overflowing it says if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be baren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you know what that tells me that means there can be a knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ that is Barren and unfruitful that you can have an understanding you can have a revelation you can have an exposure and experience to Christ but it doesn't produce life cuz he says if you're not Barren that means you're producing life and if you're not unfruitful that means you're fruitful that means you're producing fruit you've got something that's coming out of this knowledge you have he says for he that lath these things is blind cannot see a far off and ha forgotten that he was purged from his old sins he's saying you're Justified and Sanctified but you've forgotten the work he did because you didn't go on all the way and you actually forget what it is you're supposed to be he says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fail Peter is insane we'll never make mistakes I think with young people it's the the hardest thing is when you fail and guess what it never gets easier but when we're younger we tend to have we we tend to make a bigger deal of failures I think I think as we get older we find Grace and we realize the the the magnitude of Grace but I remember as a Young Man boy I could do just about any little thing and it would just about kill me because I thought that is not what a Believer ever does but guess what we lose battles sometimes and that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is for not just to forgive you of the sins you've done in the past but what you do every single day I me every single day we do these things but Peter's saying that we will never turn back to what we left behind we can't go back it's dead the old Nature's dead the desires are dead it's there's nothing to go back to you know we've talked about it before how the Vikings when they landed in a new land they burned their ships so they couldn't go back our ships are burnt there's nothing to go back to anymore he's saying if you do it this way if you'll let God do this work in your life you will never fail and if you go all the way not just justification not just sanctification but you come all the way and get the Holy Ghost you will never ever fail you can't fail because it's Christ in you but look at what he's talking about CU in Hebrews 6 it says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened there are people that get to see the realities of God brother B would talk about this all the time he says and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost notice he didn't say they were baptized by the Holy Ghost they weren't born of the Holy Spirit they're not filled they tasted and they partook they got to experience the atmosphere they got to experience the effects of the Holy Spirit and the goodness of God that's possible he says and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come you say this sounds like a Believer brother John you want to put a name here put Judas name here because Judas tasted of the powers of the world to come he saw the good things of God he heard the word he heard the truth he was that selected group that Jesus revealed The Parables to everything that the disciples before the day of Pentecost got to experience so did Judas you can have all these things sitting in the message church but he turned back before the upper room experience it says if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance they can't find a place of repentance they can find a place where they know that something's off but like Cain even when they know what they need to do there's nothing in them to do it that's a sad place to be that you could experience all of the goodness of God and yet never get the Holy Ghost he says and what happens is they turn back he says they can't renew themselves to repentance he's not saying they didn't repent the first time he's saying you repented and you came up and you turned away from the thing that matter most and now there's no repenting from that you've turned it down he says seeing they crucify to themselves the son of God aresh and put him to an open shame God won't be mocked he's got a bride brother Braham says that will not flirt with the world she won't flirt with the things of the world she won't flirt with denominations she won't flirt with men's ideas and she certainly won't go back to it she'll keep herself separated from it why because she's sealed to him amen we're coming to the sealing portion amen and it's not just charity is an attribute but it's the person of God himself coming down into our soul and sealing our soul all the way to Eternity it's that resurrection and Rapture day that he seals us to that's when we're fully restored but until then we've got this battle every day and so I want to encourage you just because there's a battle doesn't mean you're not sealed and just because you struggle doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost but stay in the battle amen cuz greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world Amen but until we're in this body chain until we get this body change we're still going to fight these shackles of this flesh every single day there's a reason brother brandham had to hang that cross in the rear mirror of his car cuz he was still a red-blooded American man that still faced the the the the desires and The Temptations that every one of us do amen but what does this ceiling look like what does it mean to us brother bam would say this he says now after you believe then you become Abram seed truly Abraham's seed he says how are we become Abraham's seed by being dead in Christ then were Abraham's seed and heirs with Abraham according to the promise he says after that's mentioned means a finished work after you believe after means something that's been something before that then this is a finished work the seal he says is a finished work it's proof of a finished work he says when you write your complete letter whatever it's going to be and seal it with your name after the package is all done up he says you seal it I used to work on the railroad with my daddy for a while when we all loaded the cars just as good as it could be the Box Car the inspector came by and he shook it he's saying we did our best job but it was up to the inspector to say if the job was good enough he says he went through and see if anything was loose and if anything is loose he condemned it notice he didn't condemn the package he condemned the packing sometimes God puts us through the Tes and we think he's rejecting us no he's not rejecting us he's rejecting the condition he's rejecting how well packed we are he's saying you're not stable enough to go to the next stage he's not saying you can't ever do it he's saying you're just not ready to move on yet he said if anything is loose he condemned it and that's what's the matter with the inspector going by tonight he goes by a lot of Our Lives the reason we don't get the Holy Ghost oh we might carry on and act like we got it but by the fruits we are known he says that's how you're known he says and he shakes it and finds a little loose place here of unbelief a little loose place here he condemns it and sets it back again he says it's got to be packed Tight cuz you've got a rough road to travel it's better to fix it now than down the road do you ever get in your car and something was just kind of rubbing a little bit and you ignore it but once you get on the highway you have a little vibration in your wheel it's not too bad at 30 km an hour when you're going through town but when you hit the highway and you're doing a 100 that little thing that's out of whack all of a sudden starts doing this and your whole car is shaking brother saying you got to get it packed tight before you get on this road because otherwise it's going to cause you problems down the road you got to get it settled up front you got to get it packed tight you got to get it built right you got to have the right material you got to have the right condition you got to be in the right place in your walk before he can give you the Holy Ghost cuz if he doesn't then it won't support it and it'll fail he says it's got to be packed Tight cuz you've got a rough road to travel remember brother Bram says if you think things are tough he says wait till you get the Holy Ghost because it only gets tougher after that because Satan knows he's sealed out he's got no access anymore and so he puts twice as many things pointed at you as he used to before because now you're identified he knows who you are and he's going to come for you with everything he's got he says when God gives a man or woman the Holy Ghost he shakes every loose feather in the mouth he's talking about the the little baby eagles you know he says you've got a ride coming amen glory he said see if she's packed upright what did he do he says justification he called her sanctification he cleansed her he says the Holy Ghost he sealed her so where's the calling justification he says sanctification he cleansed her that's where the shaking is justification sanctification that's the the shaking that's the see will you stick with the word and will you get everything else loose out sanctification is a much of work as you as it is God because God will give you the word and he'll say what are you going to do with it and you say Lord I don't want that in my life Lord I don't want that in my life Lord take that desire away and that's you saying Lord do the the work and it's the working of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives to clean those things out and it's shaking out all the loose stuff that would cause you problems down the road it's god making sure that your soul is settled on the word of God you've got a free will Choice here every day you got a choice of whether or not you'll take the word and when that's done he says packed in tight then they close the door cuz why cuz the inspector's name is on that seal they know who signed off on it and if his C his box cars that they kept pack kept coming with broken Goods they'd say you don't know how to do your job God knows how to do his job he knows how to get you to the end but he's not going to set you down the road until you're good and ready for it he says then what's the last thing he puts a seal on that railroad car to its destination he says not to the next Revival but to its destination I mean I think there's a bit of a spirit sometimes going around to where we've got to keep going to revivals we got to keep going to special meetings we got to keep doing this and we got to keep going to to that what to keep our our life no when you get the Holy Ghost the life goes with you all the time every time we love special meetings nobody loves it more than I do I love to hear somebody else preach instead of me I love to see what God's doing in another man's life in Ministry I love to see what God can bring to the people amen but I can't dwell on on those special times to keep me going I've got to go know that God's Alive and Well day by day I got to know he loves me day by day I got to know he's leading me day by day I he's got to be feeding me can you imagine if we had to if we could only get fed in special meetings no it's got to be a day by day by day hour by hour by hour relationship where we know he's with us every single day he says what we're sealed not to the next Revival not to the next Feelgood sermon not to the next hooping and hollering and dancing and shouting or anything not to the next big cry but what all the way to the destination he says amen whereby grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the he says the next Revival comes along no until you take a notion to join the other Church no he says until the day of your Redemption he says when God gives you the Holy Ghost it's a finished work work amen and you can rest your soul cuz it's done it's finished and he's the one that says when it's done sometimes we think we're ready delusions of Competency we call it at work we think we're ready we're not ready graduate from University I'm ready I'm in the ministry I'm ready no no God decides when we're good and ready he says when a baby comes forth what's the first thing in natural life water breaks if it's a natural birth what's the next blood comes what's the next love life comes the same elements come out of Christ as what we go through to get back into his body what was the first thing that come they speared aside and water came forth and blood came forth and then into thy hands I commend my spirit his Spirit came forth he says 1 John 5:7 said there are three that bear record in heaven the father and the word which is the Son and the Holy Ghost these three are one he says but there's three that bear record in Earth the water the blood and the spirit they're not one but they excuse me agree in one he says you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost but you can be justified without being Sanctified and you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost but when it's finished both justification and sanctification the Seal of the Lord Jesus Christ by the baptism is put upon you that's a sign of his work of his acceptance of his approval and it's a sign that you're going to make it all the way it's a sign of where you come from and it's a sign of where you're going and it's a sign of who you are and what family you belong to and then there's an examination of your soul that happens here and that's where God's working that's where God cares about God cares about our soul more than anything how many times would brother B say a soul is worth 10,000 worlds that's the only Eternal part of us is our soul cuz our spirit comes into our body and then it goes out of our body our soul is the thing that that God cares about amen our physical bodies he's he's not nearly so worried about he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities we know but his focus is on the Eternal portion cuz that's the part that came from him and that's the part that's going back to him over on the other side I've got a new name and I've got a new body but I've got the exact same soul I have here it's the only thing that carries over but in John he would say beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul prospered that means that the Soul's prospering is the greatest thing in the eyes of God brother Eugene Brun there's one of his things that that he taught that is stuck with me through all of my life and he said that agape love God's love is based on spiritual growth it's not based on physical benefits it's not based on natural blessings it's based on spiritual growth it's based on your soul prospering brother says I was passing by Museum not long here not long ago and they had a picture of a man's body in there that weighed 150 lb and said he was worth 84 cents in chemicals he said put a $100 suit on 84 so it's about a you can you can multiply that by $100 today so $1,000 suit on a on a you know a $84 body if we put in today's money he says walk around with your nose up in the air like it had rained it would drown you thinking you're somebody he says you're not worth but 84 cents if you weigh 150 lb and you'll wrap a $500 mink coat around 84 and won't even speak to your neighbor that's right he saying we put so much emphasis on this he says that's the ma what's the matter with the world today people are stuck up and starchy I I was listening this morning to again God in Simplicity and he's talking to he said a young man said you know I was enjoying your message brother Bram until they started shouting and they started screaming he said brother brah said you don't believe in that he said no he said it put chills up and down my back brother Braham said if they didn't do it it would have put chills up and down my back he said that man was a baseball fanatic and he said hey what was going on the other night there over in the stadium the guy said oh you should have heard should have seen it and this was this and this and that and this one was on the base is loaded and and he said cuz he called brother BR a fanatic and brother br said see you identify with that I identify with this he says but people become stuck what stuck up and starchy to where they can't even enjoy the presence of the Lord he says God will have to pour out the Holy Spirit and Wilt that thing down in you he says every one of us we're just exactly on the same level that means I'm no better than you and you're no better than me no matter what no matter what if the prophet of God were standing here he's on the same level as you and I he's just Fallen flesh he says God made us all out of one pattern no matter if you live in a better neighborhood go to a better Church you're nothing but what God's made you and who are you to Glory he said Glory comes to God yes sir a couple boys standing there one looked and said well John we're not worth very much are we I said look fella that's your body but you got a soul that's worth 10,000 worlds that's right I said that body will go back to the dust some of these days but you got a soul that will live forever take care of that he says look at the value that Jesus Christ put on it to come down from Glory To Die to redeem you he says that's the trouble when he says that's trouble we ought to listen he says we look at the outside and take care of the outside but the inside we let it go it's a wonderful thing when God blesses Our Lives I I thank the Lord every day that I've got a house I've got a roof over my head I got vehicles to drive I've got clothes to wear I've got food on the table I've got money in the bank I thank God for those things scripture says I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor SE begging bread but I read this morning brother BR says man calls Prosperity sometimes religion in other words we turn our natural blessing blessings into our spiritual walk what we have and our provision becomes our religion and our relationship with God that's not what he cares about most he cares about what's in here he cares is the soul prospering and what brother bram's saying is we're looking at the outside and when the outside Prosper we say that means the inside must be prospering well if that goes then most a bunch of the world is prospering in their souls too because they've got as much and more than we do so the outside that we have is it can be a reflection but it's not necessarily a reflection brother R said man calls Prosperity sometimes religion we've exchanged the blessings of the outside for what ought to be happening on the inside he's saying we ought to be focused on what's happening in here for the change here for the blessing in here for the nature of Christ inside of our body amen these bodies are our greatest failures they're going to fail you know in science today they Health Science they say that the way how long you live is mostly genetics there are people that can smoke three packs of cigarettes a day and live till they're 90 and never get a stitch of cancer there are people that eat right and work out in the gym every day and they die with cancer at 55 why these bodies are built to fail it's a lottery Naturally Speaking there's nothing here that we should be focused on Amen but what I'm saying all of this is to ask what do our requests look like when we pray then is it focused on our bills on our vehicles on our houses on our cars on our jobs and our careers or is it focused on the soul because this is the thing he really cares about because if this is right everything else will go right right where it needs to be if this is right it flows out and it produces Christ in every aspect of our life remember what Jesus said to the disciples CU I'm saying as our prayer time spent more about the physical or the spiritual Jesus said take therefore no thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or what shall we where with shall we be clothed he says for all these things do the Gentiles seek we're Gentiles he says for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things that's our rest right there he knows what we need he knows what we need and he's a good good father and so he gives us what we have need but he's more concerned about this than anything else so he's going to work to make sure we get what we need here above and beyond everything else that we have he says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and all his and his righteousness he says and then all these things will be added unto you you'll get the kingdom of God that's the holy ghost seek the holy ghost seek that in your soul and everything else that you have need of he says he'll give it to you he says says take therefore no thought for to for the moral for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof what's coming is coming what's going to happen is going to happen we can't change it anymore than than we can change who we are he's saying don't worry about it seek after the things of God and God will take care of tomorrow God will take care of today God take care of everything that's in your future I've had a lot of trouble falling asleep the last few days and Sunday night especially and I was praying on some things and you know as I'm studying these things and you get deep into things and you start to see more and more into the heart of things I'll tell you it exposes things in your life and you say there's a lot more for my life there's a lot more in this word than I've got in my life right now and I'll tell you when you can't sleep start talking to God about the things you're seeing in your life one it'll humble you two it'll realign your heart with what God has for you you know it's it's easy to pray about the natural but when we come to the soul realm you get into the word of God it's impossible to see not to see that there's room for growth you can't look at it and not see it I mean I've just preached on the of a perfect man and half of it I feel like I don't have it's not that I don't have it it's that the deeper you get into these things the more you see the depth that there is to it and the greater revealing of it that is supposed to be coming through our lives and you say Lord take me higher and that means more of me has to die out every day and there's got to be a victory over this every single day and this drives us crazy this is our greatest enemy this is our greatest enemy and so I'm laying there and I'm praying Lord I see that there's so much more for me help me to seek that and not everything else help me to focus on those things in my life man remember uh Peter said if you do these things he says there comes a diligence with it because a revelation of our shortcomings ought to bring a diligence to ask God for it because it's not up to me to produce it it's up to me to ask the diligence is in the asking like that the remember the unjust judge and that woman that came and just kept knocking on his door day in and day night and that is a diligent woman and we ought to be the same way with our father say Lord you put it in me to do this now help me to do it because what happens we get into these these little moments you know we get into these little situations and what happens is we look in the word and we see what we ought to do and then we look at our life and we see see what we did and we see a gap there and it's God showing us there's more to be had you pass one test we just did a harder test and you fail that means there's room for growth here and so we get down on our knees or wherever whatever we do to pray and we say Lord give that to me help me to come up higher help me to die out a little more it's our job to be diligent to ask remember what the scripture says I think it's in James he says you have not because you ask not and then what you do ask you ask a Miss because you're drawn aside by your lusts what natural rather than spiritual our focus is on the things of life rather than life itself to come forth through us anden as I read the word of God as I hear the message and I go through these things what is it doing it's revealing God to me it's revealing the word to me in every aspect of it the promises the blessings the impact the fruits the experience all all of it is coming out as you're reading it and then you come up to a situation and you say Lord I need some of what I'm reading about I need more of what I'm reading about don't let me stay in this condition Church we're going in a Rapture someday and brother random would say time and time again it's later than you think where's the Cry of our heart what are we seeking is it a soul desire or is it a fleshly desire what's taking up our prayers these days is it Soul condition or is it just the everyday listen we're here and we trust everything to God the money in our bank our health the house whatever it is we trust it all to God but seek first the kingdom make sure that's sealed and then when it's sealed let's let what's in it come out through our lives and say Lord let that be the greatest aspect that of my testimony is that they can see you and me not just my finances or my home or these different things you know my kids ought to be able to look at me and see what they can do cuz they're me my daughter is half me and she's half my wife so Blanca can do it Selena ought to be able to do it and if I can do it Jonathan ought to be able to do it how do they know what they can do they see mommy and daddy do it how do we know what we can do the word shows us the word says this is for you this is you these are the attributes this is the nature this is the power this is the authority this is the position of the believer and we've seen it in Christ's life we've seen it around us we can look especially at our elders and see what the word of God can do in our life when it's sealed by the holy spirit that gives us hope God bless our older ones for the life that they live so we can see you can live a life above reproach that you can live above this world that you can stay aside from it and not be messed up and dirtied up by the things that this world tries to throw at us God bless you for it but we've got to look at what the word my kids look at me Jonathan thinks if I can do it then he can do it funny thing with him is that he thinks if I can do it he can do it better that's even that's a I love that attitude cuz I I believe I firmly believe that when I marry my wife we combine two things and two of those together make something greater than just me and greater than just her so I believe that all of my children have an opportunity to be greater than I am in whatever we call greatness because they've got the best to both of us I believe but we look at the word that's how we know what's possible that's how we know what's required that's how we know what's available but if we're not looking at the word how do you know what's in you how do you know what's available to you how do you know where the promises are if you don't read the promises if we want to be like Christ we've got to look at Christ I guarantee you listen chances are that one of my boys will be an engineer why because Daddy's an engineer chances are Levi is going to do something similar to Matt and one of Joe's boys or maybe daughter will go in his footsteps why they see what's possible and they admire it and that's what's supposed to be happening as we look at the word is we say this is me I come from this this is built into me this is a part of me and as we read it it starts to what show us what's possible because we've got to follow the same trajectory of all of those real Believers in the scripture we've got to follow the same trajectory as Christ to recognize who we are step into it and see the manifestation of the word in our life but how are we going to see it if we don't first see it you got to have a template there you got to have an image in front of you amen we've seen the word made flesh we've seen it in Christ and we've seen it come down again in a prophet and he was a first fruit he was a sheath offering before us to show us what happens when the word gets inside of you and the way it's meant to be in this age in the Omega Church age we've seen what happens and we become the word by looking at the word we become the word by feeding on the word be we become the word by dwelling in the presence of the word and it does a work inside of us amen Paul put it this way he said but we all with open face as in a GL beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord a glass of mirror he says are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord the Amplified says and we all with unveiled face most of us have never worn a veil men especially but if you've ever you know hidden in the curtains from your siblings or something and they're the really thin sheer ones you can see through but you can't see all the details and you're just looking for shape or you're listening for sound so you can jump out and scare them but when you put a veil on you can't see perfectly you can see okay but you can't see the way you're supposed to and Paul says when we look at the word we don't have a veil in front of us it's completely open before us he says continually seeing as in a in a mirror the glory of the Lord we look at the mirror and we see him he says and when we do that we are progressively being transformed into his image from one degree of Glory to to even more Glory he says which comes from the Lord who is the spirit you want to become like God you got to look at God you want to become the word you got to look at the word and then what happens is you start comparing what the word is and where you're at and you see the Gap and all of a sudden you realize there's a need for a change cuz you're here and the word's here and you say Lord we got to do something about this cuz your word says I'm this but I can't lie I I feel like I'm here and what happens then is because we are children of God the spirit of God is on us and we go and we say Daddy Aba father I'm your child this is your program this is your life this is your word and I'm a part of it so I'm coming to you diligently seeking you to say make me what you said I am again the diligence for us is to ask and to surrender and it's up to him to do the work cuz we can't do it we can't do it in and of oursel what is it it's God shaking my life he's showing me what he is and then he's letting me see who I am and it's not to put us down it's to raise us up it's to raise us up now guess what sometimes he shows me him through somebody else there are people I admire just for the the nature they have the characteristics they have and I say Lord make me more like them cuz that's you and them but sometimes I got to go straight to the word but regardless what he's doing is he's showing us himself and saying be like me come up a little higher step out a little further die out a little more surrender a little more remember what he said I just quoted it in Galatians 4 he said and because you are Sons because you don't get the spirit because you asked you get it because you are Sons because you're children because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts cried Abba Father other people don't cry out to God this way why cuz he ain't their dad cuz there's nothing in them but we got something in us and my what I'm asking you is what is it that you're crying out for Is It soul or is it Spirit or is it body because he'll let anything happen in spirit and body to get to your soul brother B said he'll lay you flat on your back he'll take you down to the bottom he'll strip everything away from you to get your soul and then once that's taken care of then he'll add back everything that you have need of but the soul is what he's coming after brother Brown puts it this way he says if you repented and are baptized then God's under obligation he says if your faith is right towards God to give you the Holy Ghost the minute that you obey his word he says believe that God will vindicate it to you if your hearts really right before God and you're taught right and believing it and walk up there with assur with the Assurance something's going to happen that's a reflection of your faith you go up in faith asking and that Faith get allows you to receive what he's got for you he said because God's more willing to give you the Holy Ghost than you are willing to accept it God's trying to press in but he's a gentleman he won't come in unless you ask but he says he's more willing to give it than you are to accept it God wants to heal you more than you want healing God wants to deliver you more than you want Deliverance he says but you got to go up with a faith that something's going to happen he says I don't believe there's any man or woman in any of the groups could ever face Jesus Christ and truly repent of their sins with a true full surrendered heart saying Lord I truly believe but what God would place on them the baptism of the Holy Ghost right at that time I literally read today brother Bram says you don't have to T and T and T and T and he he reads that that scripture that I quoted earlier where Peter where it says that pet while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the words he says you don't have to T and T and T meaning you don't have to expect to wait but you T until you get it you stay until you got got it cuz that's the guarantee that you're going to make it to the other side but he says that's not a requirement for you to T it doesn't have to take forever you go you come in truly repenting truly surrendered he says truly repent that means you've changed your ways you can't say I repented and you're still doing what you are doing and then he says a true full surrendered heart that means you've died to yourself you've changed your ways and you've died to yourself acts 238 says repent and be baptized it starts with repentance and you know I I think sometimes as Believers we think that repentance was back then and we forget that it's an all the way through situation remember we talked about in the last couple of services in Revelation 3 that there's a zealous repentance that's required for Leo deia why because as the word is revealed glory is revealed to us we see the error of our ways we see the shortness of our life and we repent we repent because we've walked in ignorance and now we've got knowledge and we say Lord I'm sorry I was doing wrong in our ignorance nonetheless we still repent for that and if we don't see the error we'll never see the need for Change and if we never see the Need For Change we'll never repent but if we're being changed that automatically means that repentance is a part of our life because it means we were wrong and now we need to be made right it's a zealous thing it's a constant thing it's a it's an all the time thing brother B I just just read the quote to somebody the other day he said we backslide every day backslide every day listen to this one he says we are tempted all of us are tempted all of us sin there's none without sin every day we sin oh that's people that don't have the Holy Ghost no that's people with the Holy Ghost Paul said he had to Die daily he says and if we say we have no sin then the Bible said we make God to lie and we could not do that he said so we sin daily and it's Grace God's grace that saves us and as we confess our wrongs God is just to forgive them repentance is an everyday thing he said in your confession as long as it holds Good your salvation is perfect and then he says it's the same it is with Divine Healing it's your personal faith in a resurrected Lord when people tell me brother John I've repented Brother John I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I don't have the Holy Ghost I say something's wrong then cuz if you done what he required then he's got to do what he said he'd do brother Braham said if anybody comes to God on the same basis as somebody else did they get the same results so if you say I've done everything I'm supposed to and I don't have the Holy Ghost then I say you haven't done what you said you did you might think you did but you haven't done it all the way you may not have repented right or you you may not have died out cuz remember baptism is symbolic of a dying out and when you do the baptism you think well that's it no no no you got to die out you got to die out not just get baptized you got to do what the baptism actually says you're doing die out rise a new creature a new nature a new spirit these different things amen why because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God that confirms that you come his way that you're in the condition that he requires so if you don't have it it's only because you haven't asked for it or you're not in the right condition to receive it there's only two reasons it's not cuz God holds it back for fun remember God wants to give it to you more than you want it so it's not God holding it back it's something in our lives that would hold it back but he also says you notice here he says it's your faith your personal faith you got to believe it's for you you got to believe it's for you you got to believe that it's not just for the person next to you but I I am supposed to get the Holy Ghost and then you go looking for it brother says and today when we say that we believe we can believe in a measure but when God gives us the baptism of the Holy Ghost he confirms our faith and seals us he says the Holy Ghost is the confirmation of your faith in God God has confirmed it and recognized it so and put the seal of approval on you he says that's what we want isn't it that's what the church needs he says that's what makes you alive he says in the way God is expecting us as an individual to grow he says it's the way he has brought his church in to grow Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue say he says seek Him Up knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly love and brotherly kindness and then the love of God he says the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place he says when a man possesses these kinds of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift God has got you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but when those virtues grow in and you've added that to that he says then you're a living Monument you're a living moving Idol and I've read this quote before he says but when we not in an imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God what happens life he says a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming from a living God makes a living man a Living Image in the stature of God you know what that tells me Church life is what matters brother Ram would say it time and time again by their fruits you shall know them what kind of a life are you living not just Doctrine you got to have right Doctrine not just right Ministry you got to have the right Ministry but your life has to be Christ that's what he's looking for this whole series I'm manifesting time is do you have the Life of Christ in you that's the only thing that matters it's the only thing he's looking for he says what's he doing this living man he says the same things that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not an imaginary thing there's a reality that proves it now let me say this we mature we grow you'll have a reality as a teenager that will grow into the reality as a someone in their 20s and 30s and as you go through marriage and family and all these different things your reality grows absolutely it does the things that God has done for my life now versus what he did back then completely different different ways different measures different expectations God has a higher stand standard for my life now than he did when I was 20 but God has revealed himself in a greater way now than one he has when I was 20 everything's growing everything's moving because we're going into a Rapture Ready condition we've got to be growing he says there's a reality that proves it he says now that is the house that God dwells in not a building with a big Bell on on top of it in a high steeple sea but a body hast thou prepared me a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in now see we're talking about things that are outside the soul now but what happens is when he sealed the soul now he starts working on everything else in a greater way to where you are Christ embodied he says amen the living instrumentality of God God walking on two feet in you if I said who in here is God walking on two feet what would you say brother Gerald would you raise your hand and say you're God walking in two feet he raised his hand it's God in Simplicity Church you you got to have that same Revelation not that you are what you ought to be but you've been changed you've been reborn and the life you live is not your life but it's Christ in you not that you would rest on where you're at but you rest on the finished work that's making you grow and mature into the fullness of an adopted son and daughter in Christ Christ wow God walking on two feet in you if you've got the holy ghost in your life in your soul you can put your name in that quote if Paul can say it as a holy ghost filled believer than anyone else in the same condition can put their name there as well the life that I live I live by the faith in the son of Jesus in the in Jesus Christ is Christ in you the hope of glory yeah our Epistles seen and read of all men the word made flesh we've got to be able to say it you know why we don't because we're not looking in the mirror we're not looking in the word as much as we ought to we're caught up with the challenges of life and the failures of life and the stresses of life and the kingdom of God has being put in second place in our minds and we forget who we are I like what somebody said a little while ago and I'll probably mess it up but they said you know Lord you know it's been a good day things have gone real well I haven't lost my temper haven't spoken ill of anyone good thoughts but I'm about to get out of bed now right help me Lord Church brother Braham said we're living below our privileges what the scripture say set your mind on things above where are we dwelling I say if you've got the Holy Ghost what's it doing because a sealed Soul has an effect on the rest of your life every single day you've got a victory that nobody else has you've got a source that nobody else has you got fruit that nobody else has you have a refuge that nobody else has has you have a healing you have a promise that nobody else has I'm talking in this world not not amongst Believers of course but you got something to that's in you you know we we we come to church and we talk about oh was a wonderful atmosphere you carry that atmosphere with you every single day if you'd only recognize it that you can have the same atmosphere you can cry you can shout you can be silent you can shake You Can Dance anywhere if that Holy Spirit is in your soul there is no limit to what it can do it's with you even in you to the end of the age you're a finished work in here now let that start working on the rest of your body on the rest of your spirit on the rest of your being that's where we're going to go over the next couple Services I think is what happens and the benefits and the effect of the indwelling of Christ in you he says God walking in two feet in you glory I don't think he said Glory That Way Church the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord God walking in you see remember what I said God in Simplicity you think it's not God walking in me but if you're walking in his light if you're walking in his will if you're walking in his plan it's Christ walking in you no difference he says for ye are written Epistles read of all men and if the life that's in Christ be in you you'll bear the life that Christ bore he says and now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in see and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controls you and your feet are the foundation Faith amen he says controlled by the head there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues and he's got someone in control he's got someone in the control tower what a picture what a position you don't just have attributes but you have Christ in those attributes you literally have Christ expressed as those attributes it's now a person not just an attribute it's a life not just a thing it's not just an emotion or a thought or a feeling or a conception but it's literally him working in every aspect of our life and the only thing he's looking for is people that'll surrender that's the greatest thing we've got to do church is surrender ourselves to him day in and day out and that comes with how we seek and what we seek that'll show you where your surrender is you know we look at that you know I I I've been reading the book of Acts again and you read what they do and you say Lord could it ever happen in my life but here's the thing if you're a woman you're not called to that not all our Apostles not all our ministers not all our men there are things that are reserved for certain things and it's not meant to be in your life but there are things that are meant to be in your life and that's what we'll get into as we get into adoption and these things is that we live normal lives most of us we're not special we don't have great Ministries most pastors don't have great Ministries they're simple men that are just feeding the flock then we're not all prophets we don't all have Global Ministries you know we've got mothers and we've got wives and guess what they're not out there spreading the gospel the way that min Ministry is they're not they're not walking around the globe the way that the prophet did they're not doing those things but yet you're supposed to display Christ and there's a life that you live and it's God in your own two feet walking through this world walking through this life and there's a way that we're supposed to live and brother Brandon would say it's in every type of Life there is you you you take whatever it is whether it's a a blue collar worker a white collar worker whether you're a mother at home whether you're in the office whatever it might be he says you're supposed to be true sons of God and Daughters of God in those roles and it'll separate you from everybody else I say are we close brother Braham said there's only one thing left and that's the going away of the church I think I said it earlier it's later than you think as I've been listening to this message on God and simplicity back home it just it strikes me and I know it's come through in some of these Services how that if we could only see what he's doing we'd have faith for what he's about to do because it's God in Simplicity it's never this great big thing it's the little things you know we we tend to ignore the little things but the little things are the Stepping Stones to the big things you know we want we want to I talking with a brother this week about this and and he listened to the service and he was kind of saying it really struck him how that that idea how you can't get to the perfection without the inart and what happens is we dis we dismiss the inart we dismiss the little things cuz we consider it insignificant but God's working in little things to do big things the little things add up and they become a big thing remember what Jesus said this the parable of the talents he said and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou deliver to me five talents behold I've gained bes IDE them five talents more God gave him five and he got five his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord thy Lord what's he saying if you want to go to big things take care of the little things you want God in a big way then take care of God in the little way you you want God to bless you in amazing ways then take care of it in the little things he's given us cuz you can't go to unless you're proven in the small nobody makes a person a CEO that has no experience and nobody makes somebody CEO that comes straight out of school if they're in the right mind cuz what they've got to be proven in the small things before they can step in to the big things you know you think about our kids you know first thing is you can go out and you can start the car in the winter right we turn it into a treat and they can go out and they can start the car and they can turn the heater on you know maybe as they get older they then maybe we'll let them you know use this Scraper on it and they learn not to scratch the paint or do those different things and then maybe when they're 16 or 17 we'll allow them to move the car forward and backward a little bit as they prove them themselves in the small things we let them do the bigger things it's no different with God God does gives us a little thing God puts us in a little place of responsibility he gives us a little opportunity and he sees will we be faithful in it and then as we prove faithful then he raises us to the next level and he'll raise us as high as we're willing to go as much as we're willing to surrender as much as we're willing to obey as much as we're willing to do is how far he'll let us go and we're the limiter not God if we prove faithful amen he's got to prove us and as we come up to this idea of adoption and perhaps a well I don't know when it'll be at this rate but as we get to it we see it's a process of small steps leading up to big things Isaiah 28 as we start to close he says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine he says them that are weaned from the milk and draw from the breasts you know what he's saying baby Christians need not apply if you need to be spoonfed everything if you need to be padded and coddled all the time you're not going to get anywhere it's funny we were over at brother Paul and sister Kims and I knew I was going to be talking about babies that need to be weaned and you know there are some babies don't get weaned for years I've met babies that were 3 years old and still drinking milk cuz they refused to move on to something else they like milk they like nursing they like the contact they like the Comfort whatever it was they like the taste whatever it was and they refuse to try anything else cuz here's the thing how do you know when the baby's ready the parent knows best the parent knows there's a time to start introducing new foods when their stomach can handle it their digestion can handle it and so you start to what blend in a bit of more solid food with their milk cuz the milk is only meant for a certain amount of time and then after a while it's actually deficient of nutrients and they need something else but you'll get a baby that's stubborn and they'll refuse to be weaned and you know what happens they get fussy and then they get even more fussy because they're not getting what they need and they're the only thing that's holding them back mama is ready to give it to him she's tried them on food Daddy's trying to give them more solid food and these different things but the baby refuses it and the baby won't grow the way it's supposed to and it actually hurts the baby God puts things in front of us by the word how are you ready for more word he puts it in front of you how how do you know when you're ready to come up higher God calls you God gives you the opportunity he places the choice in front of you that's when you're old enough to do it that's when you're big enough that's when you're mature enough to come to a higher level is when he puts it in front of you that's it the parent chooses when it's time for the child to come up a little bit higher you know the disciples had a time where Jesus said I've got many things to tell you but you can't handle it yet but there came a time when they could handle it when they matured enough and he revealed it to them and they could step into the word in a greater way he says for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept it's one thing after another and you can't can't go to the next thing until you've done the first thing until you've settled the first thing you can't go to the second thing and until you've settled the second thing you can't go to the third and until the third you can't go to the fourth it's got to be fixed and then you got to build it up bit by bit then he says line upon line line upon line one at a time not all together God doesn't just do this big download on you he Build You Up bit by bit make sure it's steady make sure it's stable make sure you got got it and then he goes to the next bit and the next bit and the next bit he says here a little and there a little bit by bit as he determines it's what he did in Canaan remember he says and little by little I'll give you the land little by little he says lest it be overcome by the beasts if I give you the victory too quick it'll be worse for you you got to go bit by bit so you can hold on to what you've got it's like graduation from school you know I I I think this is the way it can some times feel within the message is we we've been given the whole picture and we know we're an end time bribe we know we're called for rapturing faith we no we're we're we're called into the third pole and all these different things the opening of the word and we see all this big picture and what can happen is we expect ourselves to do everything that the big picture shows us from day one from year 1 from year 10 whatever it might be we walk up and because we we know about it it we think we have to produce it immediately that's never in the scripture it's never in the scripture there's always a process of growth and development in for real Believers in the Scripture it always happens that way you go to school if they told you what the exam was going to be at the start of the Year you'd have no confidence you could pass the exam why because you haven't been taught precept upon precept line upon line chapter by chapter principle by principle but if you go through through the year and you do your homework and you do your quizzes and you pass your test by the time you get to the exam you've already you know everything that's in the exam and you'll pass it just fine because you've done the little by little precept upon precept all the way through it's the same thing with God just because we see the big picture doesn't mean we have to produce it all right now because it's little by little precept upon precept God drawing things out of our life God putting things into our life amen everything in this life is a test as Believers everything's a test every day is a test every every opportunity every thought every relationship everything we go through is a test to see what we're going to do and as we deal with those things God brings us to the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one until finally he says they're good to go and they graduate gives you the Holy Ghost takes you into adoption cuz you've been built up in the Most Holy Faith line by line bit by bit bit by bit and then what the seal so the soul is sealed then after that what happens and as we close on this he says first foundationally we're talking about these stages he says first foundationally is Faith second add to your faith virtue to your virtue Knowledge from knowledge Temperance from Temperance patience to patience godliness and from godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then love being the Capstone he says seven of those things seven Church AG see and the Seven Stars of the church ages and all of it is tempered together by the Holy Spirit he says now that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ and everything before that like I said it's a test shaking it to see what'll come out and if nothing comes out then you move to the next thing and he shakes that and when that's settled then he moves on to the next thing and it's shaking shaking shaking everything's a test to see will you stand firm will you not lose your Christian it in the situation is your Christianity tied to how much money is in your bank account how good your health is how good your marriage is how nice your kids are how good the service was how good the service wasn't who's song leading what they're singing proving all of these things to see what kind of a nature is in there and what you're going to surrender to but then once that soul is sealed what does he do he takes us here this is what we had from way back back when and he starts now to push from in there and now the mind of Christ comes in and that's what's pushing out now into your spirit and now what's happening is the word is going into your imagination the word is going into your conscience the word is going to your memory to reason affection and then when he has those channels all cleared out then now it's moving out to your body and you'll literally see that what happens is the holy spirit is taking dominion over every aspect of your body and it's bringing you to a Rapture condition because when your spirit's done then it's the body and all it's doing is it's preparing that body to go and what experience a change it's just bringing you from glory to glory to the place that you're ready to go but you got to get this sealed once that's sealed God says it'll take care of everything else once that's done don't worry about the rest it it's almost like uh you know they have a yeah they have these things where you you know they've got a timer on it and when the timer goes off it opens up that's what this is it's something that's set and as soon as it opens there's no holding it back you don't have to do anything to it it's self-sufficient it's self- sustaining and it just starts to work in your life and it starts to bring everything now under a total Dominion to the word of God not just here a bit and there a bit but it's now bringing everything under the authority of Christ in your life the soul is settled the Integrity of your heart is known that's what he said to Solomon he said your father David served from the Integrity of his heart the heart was right and when that's right in there the soul is settled it starts to now work into our life and bring everything under the authority of the word and it turns you into a living Christ amen God bless you let's stand together if we would amen it's a fight brother Bram says it's a rough road you've got you know it's funny with modern technology we can do a lot but you ever look at what they did with those old train tracks and as smooth as it looks when you got moving pretty quick it was a rough ride he's saying it's a rough ride even with the Holy Ghost it's a rough ride there's a there's a reason why Paul called US soldiers I think because we're in for a rough time you know what's interesting about diligence when it comes to diligence there's two things that stand out as soldiers and athletes cuz soldiers will shoot and shoot and shoot every single day they perfect their craft because it's a matter of life and death if they get it wrong and for athletes the only way to win is to do more and be better than the person next to you and so every day they train they train they train they eat right they sleep right they dress right they have the best habits in in the world to make their bodies as perfect as they can possibly get it for competition for that Soldier it's all about you and the guy next to you saving lives and Taking Lives that's where diligence comes in we look at our prayer life we look at our our needs in our life and I'm asking tonight this is what I've been asking myself what are you focused on what is the greatest desire that you would have tonight if you could have anything tonight what would it be is it natural or is it Eternal I'll tell you what I want I want to get out of here more than anything I want to get out of here and yet sometimes it seems like all you do is the stuff that would keep you here but I say Lord tonight we know that song Lord please light the fire that once burned bright do we know that I don't know if we do or not just struck me there it's okay but I say Lord light the fire a new let it burn out everything that would hold me back amen cleanse us a new amen is that your heart's desire tonight amen I want to get out of here but I don't want to go alone I can't go alone I got to take you and you got to take me amen let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord when we look into your word when we look into the mirror of your word Lord it calls us to a higher Place Lord it calls us to a greater surrender Lord and when if we could only let go to trust to have faith to believe Lord to set our eyes on things that are above to set our eyes and hearts on things that are Eternal Lord God I believe it would shake this church it would shake this world Lord if we could set aside everything that easily besets us Lord if we could let your Holy Spirit just have complete and total free reign in our lives Lord to let you loose Lord to turn loose this token that you've given us Lord God lord what a thing it would do Lord I say get me out of the way Lord I say get my brothers and sisters out of your way Lord let us put ourselves in Your Loving Hands Lord let us lay ourselves in the promise of your word Lord May every word that comes out every expression of our heart's desires Lord be for Lord the Eternal Lord benefit Lord of our souls and those around us Lord guard our words guard our thoughts Lord clean out every Lord
