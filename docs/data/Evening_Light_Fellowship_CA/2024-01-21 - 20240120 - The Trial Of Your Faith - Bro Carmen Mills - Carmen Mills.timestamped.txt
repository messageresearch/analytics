[51:12] the effort to assemble once again
[51:13] together Lord as your word has asked us
[51:16] to do and Lord we believe that you're
[51:18] here among us this evening you said were
[51:21] the two and three Gathering my name that
[51:24] I would be in the midst of them and we
[51:26] believe that Lord and we just pray your
[51:28] blessing now upon this part of the
[51:31] service we pray for those that are here
[51:34] you you know their hearts you know their
[51:36] needs and you're able to meet any need
[51:39] there is nothing that you cannot do Lord
[51:42] and we just pray for each one that's
[51:44] here maybe if there' be any listening in
[51:46] also that might be in need this evening
[51:48] that you would just come on the scene
[51:50] Lord and speak and minister to them we
[51:52] pray we just commit these things to you
[51:55] now and ask your blessing upon the word
[51:57] in Jesus Christ's name we
[51:59] pray
[52:01] amen so happy to be here with you it's
[52:04] been a a long time since I've even been
[52:07] in New Finland and I haven't actually
[52:08] been in St John's but I was thinking it
[52:11] was 40 I think almost 43 years ago was
[52:15] the last time I was here in central
[52:17] newfinland I wasn't even married then so
[52:20] that's how long it's been so we have a
[52:22] unique opportunity though as the coming
[52:24] years as a minut sister is I don't know
[52:28] your needs and so you know I believe
[52:32] that the Lord can speak very
[52:35] personally you know I I often through my
[52:37] life gone through trials and tests and I
[52:40] different times I thought you know it'
[52:41] be really nice if brother Brandon was
[52:44] here and I could go maybe and have an
[52:47] interview and I could get the answer but
[52:50] you know the answer wasn't in brother
[52:52] Brandon it was the G
[52:55] that would would give him the answer
[52:57] it's the same as at the pool of Bethesda
[53:00] when when the people would gather around
[53:02] their waiting for the moving of the
[53:04] waters you know brother brandom said the
[53:07] the healing wasn't in the waters the
[53:08] healing was with the angel and so we
[53:11] really just need him in our midst and so
[53:14] this evening we we know the scripture in
[53:16] Matthew says that where're two and three
[53:18] gathered together in his name I will be
[53:21] in the midst Jesus said that he would be
[53:24] in the midst well there's there's at
[53:26] least two or three
[53:28] here at least two or three here that are
[53:30] gathered in his name so he must be here
[53:34] well if he is here then the answer to
[53:37] every problem is
[53:38] here the answer to every question is
[53:41] here and I believe in the power of of of
[53:44] the spoken word and I believe that God
[53:46] is able to discern with the word I've
[53:48] seen it happen many times and so tonight
[53:51] I don't know anything about what's going
[53:53] on and your situation but God does and
[53:56] so God can take a scripture and God can
[53:58] take a quote or anything that's said can
[54:01] speak right down into your life I would
[54:03] know wouldn't be me and it wasn't
[54:05] brother Brandon but people Associated it
[54:07] with him it was always God but God still
[54:10] discerns the word is a discerner of the
[54:13] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[54:15] still does that today Amen Let us while
[54:18] we're standing let's turn to the 1 Peter
[54:20] chapter
[54:22] 1 1 Peter chapter 1
[54:25] we're going to speak tonight
[54:27] to to the elect and I'm trusting and
[54:30] believing that that's all of you most of
[54:32] you all of you that's here tonight would
[54:35] be represented sometimes you know you
[54:37] you speak to the sinner sometimes you're
[54:39] trying to speak to everyone but tonight
[54:41] we're going to have a subject that's
[54:43] that the sinner cannot relate to but you
[54:46] can 1 Peter chapter 1 I want to read the
[54:51] firstly the first and second verse and
[54:52] then we'll skip to verse five through to
[54:55] n 1 Peter 1 and 1 Peter an apostle of
[54:59] Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered
[55:01] throughout Pontius galatia capid doia
[55:04] Asia and bethenia notice verse two elect
[55:08] according to the for knowledge of God so
[55:10] this address that's being made in
[55:12] chapter one it's being made to the elect
[55:14] not being made to the sinner or the
[55:16] hypocrite or make believer it's being
[55:18] made to the elect through sanctification
[55:21] of the spirit unto obedience and
[55:22] sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:25] Christ Grace unto you and peace be
[55:28] multiplied drop down to verse 5 who are
[55:31] kept by the power of God through faith
[55:35] onto salvation who are kept you're not
[55:38] kept by your power you're kept by the
[55:41] power of God and if you've been serving
[55:44] the lord any length of time you know
[55:45] there are times when if it was your own
[55:48] strength you wouldn't make it but we're
[55:50] kept by the power of God that's a
[55:53] privilege that the elect have the sinner
[55:55] doesn't have that the others don't have
[55:56] that but we do who are kept by the power
[55:58] of God through faith unto salvation
[56:01] ready to re be revealed at the last time
[56:03] in the last time wherein ye greatly
[56:06] Rejoice though now for a season if need
[56:09] be ye are in heaviness through manifold
[56:12] Temptations my thought is coming from SE
[56:14] verse 7 and I'm going to speak on the
[56:18] trial of your faith at the trial of your
[56:20] faith being much more precious than of
[56:23] gold that perisheth the would be tried
[56:25] with fire might be found unto praise and
[56:28] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[56:30] Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye
[56:34] love and whom though now ye see him not
[56:37] yet believing ye Rejoice with joy
[56:39] unspeakable and full of
[56:42] Glory receiving the end of your faith
[56:46] even the salvation of your
[56:49] souls you may be
[56:51] seated this subject I've spoken many
[56:54] times and it might seem like a negative
[56:56] thing to speak about the trial of your
[56:58] faith and I'm not a negative preacher
[57:01] but the reality of of serving the lord
[57:04] if you serve the Lord as I said any
[57:06] length of time you'll you're very
[57:07] acquainted with trials you know what
[57:10] they are and you know personally what
[57:13] they are you just don't know about the
[57:15] brother and the sister's trial but if
[57:17] you've been serving the lord you know
[57:19] what trials are but even the world has
[57:22] trials too but but the prophet makes a
[57:24] state statement you know he said in in
[57:26] the world falling apart 1963 he said we
[57:29] want
[57:29] everything so that we can take it easy
[57:32] and retire and take life easy but
[57:36] brother Braham said life wasn't intended
[57:38] to be easy he said life is a struggle
[57:42] anything that's got life is struggling
[57:45] look at the trees how they struggle look
[57:47] at everything that's got life it's a
[57:50] struggle and when we try to get a system
[57:53] that takes all of that that away that
[57:55] takes it easy he said then we're wrong
[57:58] and we know that there's something wrong
[58:01] job said one time the man that is born
[58:03] of a woman is of a few days and full of
[58:06] trouble and so we know that it's like
[58:08] that brother Brandon makes a statement
[58:10] in another message in Revelation 5 in
[58:12] 1961 he said he said now Satan will
[58:16] constantly punch at you until you're
[58:19] finished here on Earth and so I'm saying
[58:23] these things and they might not say
[58:24] sound like good things to say but
[58:26] remember uh as we go through this God is
[58:30] in control of everything he's in control
[58:33] of your life and so these things that
[58:35] are happening they're not just happening
[58:37] randomly Satan will constantly punch at
[58:39] you until your finished here on Earth
[58:41] remember that you'll never have a time
[58:43] but what there's a punching going on all
[58:44] the time because you're in a battle
[58:47] you're in a battle he said did you ask
[58:49] to come to Christ to go to a picnic he
[58:52] said well you're going to be surprised
[58:54] because because it's a constant battle
[58:57] he said I've been on the field for 31
[58:58] years I fought every inch of the way
[59:01] there is a day coming there is a rest
[59:03] coming and of course there's a rest now
[59:05] for the people of God as far as in the
[59:07] spirit but in this life it's struggle
[59:10] it's testing and it's trying in the in
[59:13] in in the book of Deuteronomy there's a
[59:15] scripture in fact maybe we'll we'll go
[59:17] to Deuteronomy 11 if they can bring it
[59:20] up Deuteronomy 11: 11 and 12 the land of
[59:23] Israel the that Israel was promised to
[59:27] go into that they would come and they
[59:29] would possess it says in Deuteronomy 11
[59:32] and 11 that the land whether you go to
[59:34] possess it is a land of Hills and
[59:37] Valleys and I've often reflected on that
[59:39] you know it's kind of like the walk
[59:41] through life we know there's a great
[59:43] land of promise but we have a promise
[59:46] that's given to us as well in this life
[59:48] an Earnest of our inheritance in the in
[59:50] the Holy Ghost that we can have and we
[59:52] can live in in spiritual High places but
[59:55] we know that our walk in this life is a
[59:58] walk through valleys and and and up
[1:00:01] mountains and it was kind of like what
[1:00:03] Israel was given here a land of Hills
[1:00:06] and Valleys and drinketh the water of
[1:00:08] the rain of heaven but notice verse 12
[1:00:11] it is a land which the Lord thy God
[1:00:14] carth for so when whether you're in the
[1:00:17] valley or you're on the Mountaintop God
[1:00:21] cares about it cares about your life
[1:00:24] cares about where you are in your life
[1:00:26] he cares about it and not only that the
[1:00:28] Bible says the eyes of the Lord thy God
[1:00:31] are always upon it he's he's always
[1:00:34] looking from the beginning of the year
[1:00:37] even to the end of the year so wherever
[1:00:39] you're at in your life whatever
[1:00:41] circumstance whatever you're dealing
[1:00:42] with he's he's watching you His Eye Is
[1:00:45] on the Sparrow as the song goes and I
[1:00:47] know he watches me amen so trials where
[1:00:52] first of all let's just talk in general
[1:00:53] about trials
[1:00:55] where do these things come from where do
[1:00:58] Trials come from well we'll talk first
[1:01:02] about the ones that are not really
[1:01:03] Trials of Faith but all of us as human
[1:01:05] beings go through life and we're thrown
[1:01:08] in in circumstances and the prophet said
[1:01:11] we're put in circumstances where we have
[1:01:13] to make decisions and we make choices
[1:01:15] through life brother B said you can't do
[1:01:17] anything in life without making a
[1:01:19] decision well the decisions we make
[1:01:21] sometimes aren't always good ones we
[1:01:23] don't always do the right thing we don't
[1:01:25] always choose the right thing and when
[1:01:28] that happens we sometimes bring trouble
[1:01:31] our way and so we can sometimes have
[1:01:34] trials and sometimes tests that come our
[1:01:36] way that are simply that we are reaping
[1:01:39] what we have
[1:01:40] sown and and all of us don't have to
[1:01:42] look very far for an example of that I'm
[1:01:44] sure in our own lives I can look at my
[1:01:46] own life I'm sure you can of things I I
[1:01:49] should never have done that I should
[1:01:50] never have made that decision I should
[1:01:52] have never have made that choice tce and
[1:01:55] the Bible says in Galatians 6 and8 that
[1:01:57] he that sth to his flesh shall of his
[1:02:01] flesh reap
[1:02:03] corruption but he that sth to the spirit
[1:02:07] shall of the spirit reap life
[1:02:09] Everlasting and so we will encounter
[1:02:13] those things it could be Financial it
[1:02:14] could be physical it could be different
[1:02:16] things just making bad choices and
[1:02:18] sometimes you get yourself in a
[1:02:22] mess but you know the Lord is able to
[1:02:24] bring us through those things when it
[1:02:25] happens the the point of it is though
[1:02:27] there's a scripture let's uh in 1 Peter
[1:02:30] chap 2 and verse
[1:02:32] 20 when we have those kind of Trials the
[1:02:36] ones where we've caused the trouble
[1:02:38] ourselves it's not something that we can
[1:02:40] say well well thank the Lord I'm I I'm
[1:02:42] I'm managing this okay I have a right
[1:02:44] attitude well there's no glory in it the
[1:02:47] scripture says if you're buffeted for
[1:02:49] your faults and take it patiently see
[1:02:52] because you're just reaping what you
[1:02:53] slded you you're getting what you
[1:02:55] deserve to get and but the thing about
[1:02:58] it is if you're a child of God there's
[1:03:00] something unique about the reaping and
[1:03:03] the so the sewing and the reaping
[1:03:05] brother brandham in in a message he
[1:03:07] preached God keeps his word in
[1:03:09] Jeffersonville 1957 makes a statement he
[1:03:11] he was speaking to his own church there
[1:03:13] and he said little church struggling for
[1:03:15] the kingdom of God he said don't ever
[1:03:18] falter in this day well you know that's
[1:03:21] that's something to say different to do
[1:03:24] you know don't falter in this day but he
[1:03:26] said if if you do quickly repent jump
[1:03:30] right back up he said if you stop your
[1:03:32] toe don't fall but if you fall get up
[1:03:35] and we all fail at times there's a
[1:03:38] scripture I believe it's in the Proverbs
[1:03:40] that says the righteous man falls seven
[1:03:42] times but gets up again see The Sinner
[1:03:45] he falls and gets into trouble and he
[1:03:47] just stays in a fallen condition but the
[1:03:48] righteous men it's not that they don't
[1:03:50] fall but they get up
[1:03:52] again but brother makes this point about
[1:03:56] it when we do these things that that
[1:03:58] we're bringing trouble along we've
[1:04:00] sinned we've done something wrong and we
[1:04:01] all get caught in those things the
[1:04:03] prophet said make make mistakes every
[1:04:05] day he said you're going to get a
[1:04:07] whipping for it just remember that see
[1:04:11] you'll reap what you swow out but he
[1:04:13] makes a statement and when I first read
[1:04:15] it very first time ever read I thought
[1:04:16] it's an odd thing brother bandam said
[1:04:19] but a very powerful statement too he
[1:04:21] said whatever you do take your whipping
[1:04:23] here
[1:04:26] take your whipping here and you think do
[1:04:27] I have any option do I have any choice
[1:04:30] well in a way you do be because the
[1:04:33] sinner you see his whipping is deferred
[1:04:36] for the most part the sinner has got a
[1:04:38] judgment awaiting in The Sinner is going
[1:04:40] to be punished so you see people out in
[1:04:42] the world who do evil and and it looks
[1:04:44] like they go through life and they're
[1:04:45] getting off with everything but their
[1:04:47] punishment is coming but see for the
[1:04:50] bride we have to stand before God
[1:04:52] spotless and so when we fall all we've
[1:04:55] got to take our whipping now if we don't
[1:04:57] take our whipping now brother BR said
[1:04:59] take your whipping here because he wants
[1:05:01] to present a
[1:05:03] spotless but it's not Penance as the
[1:05:05] Catholics teach it's not that it's not
[1:05:08] self-punishment it's up to God so our
[1:05:11] part in this when we fail is to repent
[1:05:14] brother Braham said to repent but he
[1:05:15] said once you do that you get back up
[1:05:17] and you keep on going you don't go along
[1:05:20] and run yourself down and be guilty and
[1:05:22] say well I wish I didn't did and and and
[1:05:24] act like well I can't ask God for
[1:05:26] anything because I just messed up no
[1:05:27] once you've asked forgiveness and you
[1:05:29] put that thing under the blood you know
[1:05:31] the blood is so powerful brother Bram
[1:05:33] taught that that blood when that sin
[1:05:35] goes under the blood he said it's
[1:05:37] absolutely gone and in fact brother
[1:05:39] brandom said it's even gone from his
[1:05:41] memory his problem is it's not gone from
[1:05:44] our memory because we remember what we
[1:05:46] did but God doesn't if we really put
[1:05:49] that sin under the blood it's brother
[1:05:51] Brown said it's absolutely gone it's
[1:05:53] absolutely gone not just covered up it's
[1:05:55] absolutely gone and and and washed out
[1:05:58] away
[1:05:59] completely but we reap what we sow and
[1:06:01] so we go through things sometimes but we
[1:06:03] should just take that and say Lord
[1:06:05] Brother brandham said say Lord I deserve
[1:06:07] it he lets the whip down you just say
[1:06:08] Lord I deserve it and just keep on going
[1:06:11] I mean we trust that we learn from our
[1:06:14] mistakes most of us but some of us do
[1:06:17] you know sometimes you trip over the
[1:06:19] same rock you tripped over yesterday you
[1:06:21] know but that but hopefully along the
[1:06:23] way we learn Le and we don't make those
[1:06:25] mistakes but if you're a child of God
[1:06:27] God is not going to let you get away
[1:06:28] with it you don't have to worry about
[1:06:29] did did somebody see me do that no God
[1:06:32] saw you and so if there's an issue he'll
[1:06:34] take care of it so that's those kind of
[1:06:37] Trials but we don't want to focus on
[1:06:39] those kind of Trials so much we know
[1:06:40] about them we know what they are just
[1:06:42] don't let yourself get condemned over it
[1:06:44] put it under the blood and keep
[1:06:46] going but put those aside now the elect
[1:06:50] of God and only the elect of God will
[1:06:53] also experience trials and tests of
[1:06:57] Faith Trials of faith and they're the
[1:07:01] only ones that get the privilege and you
[1:07:03] might say I'd rather not have that but
[1:07:05] if you want to be an elect of God that's
[1:07:07] just what goes along with the territory
[1:07:10] these trials of Faith but as we go
[1:07:12] through I hope you'll understand maybe
[1:07:14] why God does that and how God uses those
[1:07:16] things they're not done to punish us
[1:07:19] they're not done with ill intent
[1:07:21] everything God does is with care
[1:07:24] attention and with thought and with
[1:07:26] intent and the point of it is too it is
[1:07:30] not just Satan's idea it's not that well
[1:07:32] we're a child of God and Satan's out to
[1:07:34] get us so we have to expect that no it's
[1:07:36] not that Proverbs 17 and3 will give us
[1:07:40] the first clue Proverbs 17 and3 says the
[1:07:43] fining pot is for silver and the furnace
[1:07:46] is for gold but the Lord trith the heart
[1:07:51] the Lord trith the heart not he uses
[1:07:54] Satan's just a tool he's just a a tool
[1:07:56] in God's hands but it is the Lord that
[1:07:59] tries the hearts now the trying of your
[1:08:02] faith as I said I don't want this to be
[1:08:04] a negative thing but but God does that
[1:08:07] because he knows there's something in
[1:08:09] you that he wants to perfect there's
[1:08:11] something in a child of God but we're
[1:08:13] we're like that unrefined Diamond we're
[1:08:15] we're like that gold that's got
[1:08:17] impurities in it brother brandom talked
[1:08:18] in the message time tested memorials
[1:08:21] have gone he said years ago before they
[1:08:23] had the smelters they would take the
[1:08:25] gold and they would beat it they would
[1:08:27] beat it he said and it turn it and they
[1:08:30] would beat it and they turn it and they
[1:08:32] would beat it and he said they would
[1:08:33] beat it until the beater could see their
[1:08:36] reflection in the gold so the gold
[1:08:39] before it was beaten was not in a very
[1:08:41] good condition and that's the way you
[1:08:42] and I were as we come to Christ we know
[1:08:44] God does a work in our lives but we're
[1:08:46] still not really where we should be we
[1:08:48] start out as a babe in Christ and we
[1:08:50] need to grow we need to mature God needs
[1:08:52] to get us to a place place where he can
[1:08:54] really work with us and use us and he
[1:08:57] does that one of the ways he does that
[1:09:00] is through these tests and these
[1:09:02] trials so brother bam used the example
[1:09:05] of the beater beating the gold and he
[1:09:07] then says this he said that's the way
[1:09:09] that God does to his church he gives you
[1:09:12] trial after trial and test after test
[1:09:16] trial after trial so don't look at those
[1:09:18] things as punishments they're not
[1:09:20] they're not punishments they have a
[1:09:22] purpose test after test brother Bram
[1:09:24] said until the Life of Christ is
[1:09:26] reflected in your life and so if it
[1:09:29] takes those things we it's not that we
[1:09:31] go looking for trouble none of us wants
[1:09:33] that if we could avoid it we would never
[1:09:34] have a trial but the reality is God
[1:09:37] gives those trials to us because he's
[1:09:39] trying to bring something out of us
[1:09:41] something in our character we're not
[1:09:43] we're not here to serve God just to
[1:09:45] attend church we all have a purpose
[1:09:47] every one of us have a purpose in the
[1:09:50] kingdom of God we talk about being a
[1:09:52] member of God's body well you know my
[1:09:56] physical body has many members and they
[1:09:58] all have a purpose my fingers and toes
[1:10:01] and everything have a purpose and so you
[1:10:04] have a purpose and I have a purpose and
[1:10:06] God is trying to mold and make us trials
[1:10:09] and testings are one of the tools one of
[1:10:11] the things that God does to bring us to
[1:10:13] that place where he can use us he said
[1:10:16] he gives you trial after trial test
[1:10:18] after test so the Life of Christ is
[1:10:20] reflected in your life until you become
[1:10:22] peaceful and sober and meek and gentle
[1:10:24] humble ready submissive willing he said
[1:10:28] turn your head from the things of the
[1:10:30] world looking straight to Calvary to the
[1:10:33] one who's doing the
[1:10:34] beating many times he said you think
[1:10:37] it's strange because fiery trials which
[1:10:39] is the scripture and sickness and
[1:10:41] persecution he said it's only done to
[1:10:44] test you to get the dirt out of you it's
[1:10:47] only done to get the dirt out of you
[1:10:49] test you get the dirt get the sludge out
[1:10:51] of you he said to get the slowness out
[1:10:53] of you to wake you up to the place where
[1:10:56] you can look and see the reflection or
[1:10:58] he said men can see the reflection of
[1:11:00] Christ in you Christ in you the hope of
[1:11:03] glory brother brandham said in another
[1:11:05] place and I don't have it here but
[1:11:07] you've all heard this brother Bram said
[1:11:09] that we are the only we our hands are
[1:11:12] the only hands that God has you've all
[1:11:14] heard that quote many times I'm sure we
[1:11:17] are the mouthpiece of God you know we
[1:11:18] are the only so so so God wants to and
[1:11:22] he also said brother said that God uses
[1:11:24] man to redeem man and so we see out
[1:11:27] there in the world we have loved ones
[1:11:28] you have a nice church here now I told
[1:11:30] the brother today now you need to fill
[1:11:31] fill the church up now we know it's we
[1:11:34] know we're at the end time and and we're
[1:11:36] get you know we're getting down to the
[1:11:37] end but you know there must still be
[1:11:39] somebody left there there must still be
[1:11:41] a seed somewhere because once all of
[1:11:43] those come in the prophet taught us once
[1:11:45] that last one comes in we're going to go
[1:11:47] home so maybe it's here it could be here
[1:11:49] in St John's that last we don't know
[1:11:51] where it is but who whose job is it to
[1:11:54] get that last one in it's yours it's
[1:11:56] mine and how do we do that by getting
[1:11:58] ourselves in the place the best way to
[1:12:01] witness is to be a light to be let your
[1:12:03] life the prophet said be your Pulpit out
[1:12:06] there in the world on your job or
[1:12:08] wherever you are and the people you
[1:12:09] associate with to live such a life that
[1:12:11] brother Bram said it would attract it
[1:12:13] causes an attraction how many people did
[1:12:15] Brother Bram talk about in different
[1:12:16] ones that were drawn to to to give their
[1:12:19] life to God because of a life they saw
[1:12:22] that was lived sincere life in testings
[1:12:25] and trials and they watch your life see
[1:12:27] how you respond when things are
[1:12:28] difficult then they see that's we know
[1:12:31] that's not that's not something that
[1:12:33] just ordinary people can do be on the
[1:12:35] job a circumstance come up and how
[1:12:37] people will fly off the handle and then
[1:12:39] they look at you and you see you don't
[1:12:40] do that you don't fly off the handle
[1:12:42] you're calm and you don't get
[1:12:44] upset that's because there's something
[1:12:46] different people look for that people in
[1:12:48] the world are looking for the reality of
[1:12:50] it but they just don't see it they see
[1:12:52] lots of professing Christians but then
[1:12:55] when the test comes they see something
[1:12:57] different my wife works as a nurse in
[1:12:59] the emergency room and there's been
[1:13:01] different times people have come in and
[1:13:03] she mentioned one time about you know
[1:13:05] there's people that have come in that
[1:13:06] have professed Christianity some that
[1:13:07] even ministers and things would come in
[1:13:10] and then you find out sometimes when
[1:13:11] they're suffering and in pain you see
[1:13:13] another side of their character things
[1:13:15] come out of their mouth that you would
[1:13:17] think well they're supposed to be a
[1:13:18] Christian and here's all the people
[1:13:20] seeing that all the nursing look at that
[1:13:21] and think here's somebody who's profess
[1:13:23] to be a Christian look what the attitude
[1:13:25] that they have and so when they look at
[1:13:27] that they think well is there any
[1:13:29] Christians anywhere but there are and so
[1:13:31] you and I that God wants to have people
[1:13:34] on this Earth that are going to be
[1:13:36] whether whether things are going easy or
[1:13:38] whether they're going hard you're the
[1:13:40] same you react the same you act the same
[1:13:42] you're still you still have a faith you
[1:13:44] still have a testimony for God that that
[1:13:47] the people can
[1:13:48] see so that's what God is trying to do
[1:13:51] with these testing you know the beating
[1:13:54] with the gold you know the beating does
[1:13:56] not diminish the gold you know he's
[1:13:58] beating it sounds like a rough thing to
[1:13:59] do it doesn't hurt the gold at all it's
[1:14:02] getting rid of the sludge it's getting
[1:14:03] rid of all the other stuff but it
[1:14:05] doesn't hurt the gold you think the
[1:14:06] trial hurts you but it doesn't trials my
[1:14:09] mom used to always say trials are to
[1:14:11] make us better not bitter she always
[1:14:13] said that your trials to make you better
[1:14:15] not
[1:14:16] bitter God is not giving us these things
[1:14:18] because he wants to cause us to fail
[1:14:21] there's nothing that God will bring your
[1:14:23] way that's designed for you to fail God
[1:14:26] wants you to succeed God wants you to to
[1:14:29] to grow stronger brother Brown said in
[1:14:32] Jehovah Gyra 1957 in Phoenix he said God
[1:14:35] loves how God loves to test his people
[1:14:39] every child that comes to God must be
[1:14:42] tested child trained no
[1:14:45] exceptions no exceptions he said
[1:14:48] everyone and then he used the this
[1:14:50] example he said maybe tonight you're
[1:14:52] sick just to have some child a little
[1:14:55] child training just a little testing he
[1:14:58] said don't be discouraged God is on the
[1:15:00] throne he knows all things if we're
[1:15:02] truly born of the spirit of God
[1:15:04] everything is working together for our
[1:15:07] good he's going to make everything right
[1:15:09] he promised that he would he swore that
[1:15:12] he would he's got to keep his
[1:15:14] word in another message communion 1957
[1:15:19] Jeffersonville he said when we get right
[1:15:21] with God and when our hearts become pure
[1:15:25] and the Holy Spirit has taken its place
[1:15:28] in our heart now think about that he
[1:15:30] said when we get right when our hearts
[1:15:32] become pure and the Holy Spirit has
[1:15:34] taken its place in our heart he said
[1:15:35] it's the most glorious thing to have
[1:15:38] testing not the way in our it doesn't
[1:15:41] make human sense to us to think that but
[1:15:43] brother B say it's the most glorious
[1:15:44] thing to have testing the Bible says
[1:15:46] that our testings and trials are more
[1:15:49] precious to us than silver or
[1:15:52] gold so he said we should be thankful I
[1:15:54] know that doesn't make sense it doesn't
[1:15:56] make human sense it doesn't make any
[1:15:58] sense from from a natural point of view
[1:16:01] but God doesn't think the way we do God
[1:16:03] doesn't work the way we
[1:16:05] do it is the honor I believe it was
[1:16:08] Charles burgeon might have said that the
[1:16:09] honor of Faith to be tried I want to go
[1:16:12] to Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12
[1:16:18] where it speaks about God and it's using
[1:16:22] the uh the analogy as a were of God is
[1:16:25] the father and how that he works with
[1:16:28] his children I want to pick it up at the
[1:16:30] 4th verse of Hebrews
[1:16:34] 12 again speaking about trials he said
[1:16:37] you have not resist he said you have not
[1:16:41] yet resisted onto blood striving against
[1:16:45] sin Hebrews 12:4 and then verse five ye
[1:16:48] have and ye have forgotten the
[1:16:50] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[1:16:52] children my my son despise not now the
[1:16:56] chastening of the Lord now the word
[1:17:00] chastening you know we think about
[1:17:01] chastening sometimes as as punishment
[1:17:04] but that's not really the intent here in
[1:17:06] this word this chastening uh the way
[1:17:09] it's used here in the scripture and if
[1:17:10] you look in the Greek it's it's a the
[1:17:13] chastening is a word that means it means
[1:17:17] that it's designed what God is doing as
[1:17:19] a father is designed for our Improvement
[1:17:23] so it's not it's not a punitive word
[1:17:26] it's it's a
[1:17:27] nurturing instructive term when it talks
[1:17:30] about chastisement we sometimes in our
[1:17:32] minds think about chastisement as
[1:17:34] punishment but that's not the intention
[1:17:37] of what it is here he said uh despise
[1:17:40] not now the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:17:41] faint when thou art rebuked of him for
[1:17:46] whom the Lord loveth he
[1:17:49] chasteneth and it is with God's love so
[1:17:53] the this the chastisement doesn't come
[1:17:56] so much from God's hand the way we think
[1:17:58] of punishment but it comes from God's
[1:18:00] heart comes from God's heart it's God's
[1:18:03] love for us and really if a father you
[1:18:06] know the Bible says in the B was in
[1:18:08] Proverbs that he that spareth the rod we
[1:18:10] always use the it's not the scripture
[1:18:13] but people use if you spare the rod you
[1:18:14] spoil your son that's not what the Bible
[1:18:16] says Bible says if you spare the rod you
[1:18:19] hate your son he that spareth the rod
[1:18:22] hateth his son that's actually the
[1:18:23] Scripture it doesn't say spoiled it says
[1:18:26] hated why because chastisement as we
[1:18:29] raise our children if we love them we
[1:18:31] are not going to let them do things that
[1:18:35] are going to cause them to grow up and
[1:18:36] have a bad character and so as a good
[1:18:39] father as hard as it may be there's
[1:18:41] times we have to chastise our children
[1:18:44] but but we're supposed to do it with a
[1:18:46] lot we should never do it in Anger it's
[1:18:48] got to be something that's done with
[1:18:50] love and that's how God is he's our best
[1:18:52] example example of of a father he does
[1:18:55] it with love every child the L for whom
[1:18:59] the Lord loveth verse six he chasteneth
[1:19:01] and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:19:05] receiveth and so he said if you endure
[1:19:07] that chastening God will deal with you
[1:19:09] as Sons for what son is he whom the
[1:19:12] father chasteneth
[1:19:14] not and and and here's the thing you say
[1:19:17] I don't want to be chastised well the
[1:19:18] Bible says if ye be without chastisement
[1:19:20] verse 8 whereof all are partakers are ye
[1:19:23] bastards and not
[1:19:26] sons and so it goes on in that scripture
[1:19:29] in verse 9 speaking about the fathers of
[1:19:32] the flesh it said the fathers we have
[1:19:34] had the fathers of our flesh which
[1:19:35] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[1:19:38] but shall we not much more much rather
[1:19:41] be in subjection unto the father of
[1:19:43] spirits and
[1:19:46] live for they if you notice verse 10 for
[1:19:49] they verely for a few days chastened us
[1:19:51] after their own
[1:19:53] pleasure and what that's really speaking
[1:19:55] about and all of us have been guilty as
[1:19:57] as as fathers many of us probably have
[1:19:59] been guilty as fathers that sometimes
[1:20:01] our our chastening has an element of of
[1:20:05] of our own feeling into it so we come
[1:20:08] home from work and you're tired and and
[1:20:10] you know and and and the little boy or
[1:20:13] girl has been bad and the mom comes
[1:20:14] along and you you don't feel like doing
[1:20:16] it because you're tired and so sometimes
[1:20:18] your chastening is it isn't it's
[1:20:21] subjective but with God it's not like
[1:20:23] that so we sometimes you know ER in that
[1:20:27] sense but the Bible says he does it for
[1:20:29] our profit his chastening to us is
[1:20:33] always about what's best for us it's all
[1:20:36] about what's best for us and so when
[1:20:38] we're in a trial and we're in a test
[1:20:41] like that understand that God is giving
[1:20:44] us that for some benefit to us it's for
[1:20:47] our profit that we might also be
[1:20:49] partakers of his Holiness so why while
[1:20:52] it's not an easy thing while it's not
[1:20:54] not an enjoyable thing to experience God
[1:20:57] is thinking about something good every
[1:21:00] time he brings it our way whatever that
[1:21:02] trial might be it's for some profit for
[1:21:05] some benefit to us and so as we said
[1:21:09] we're not going to escape those things
[1:21:11] brother brandham said and sometimes
[1:21:12] those tests seem hard brother brandham
[1:21:15] used the word cruel in in the message
[1:21:17] communion 1957 he said if God did not
[1:21:20] spare his own son from the cruel test he
[1:21:23] will not spare you and I from the cruel
[1:21:25] so sometimes it seems cruel sometimes it
[1:21:27] seems hard but it's still it's still for
[1:21:31] our purpose for our for our benefit for
[1:21:34] our profit I want to to look at some
[1:21:37] characters in the scripture and the
[1:21:38] first one I want to look at is is job I
[1:21:40] want to go to job chapter 1 we're all
[1:21:44] familiar with job's trial and this test
[1:21:48] and how but I want to I want to focus on
[1:21:50] how it come to be we said that it's it's
[1:21:53] not just Satan's idea these trials but
[1:21:55] the Lord tries the hearts well it was
[1:21:57] the same thing with
[1:22:00] job the record of job in Job chapter 1
[1:22:03] and verse one is that there was a man
[1:22:06] from The Land of Oz whose name was job
[1:22:08] and the man was perfect and upright and
[1:22:10] one that feared God and issued evil
[1:22:13] that's what the scripture says you might
[1:22:15] say well that's just what somebody wrote
[1:22:17] well when you go further down and of
[1:22:19] course you read and we're won't won't go
[1:22:20] through all of that but we know job did
[1:22:23] sacrifice for his family he was very
[1:22:26] careful in the way that he lived and so
[1:22:28] job is living if you can just imagine
[1:22:31] job is going about his life living a
[1:22:33] righteous life doing the best that he
[1:22:35] can and and and completely oblivious to
[1:22:40] something that's about to take place in
[1:22:42] that other in one of those other
[1:22:43] dimensions that he wasn't didn't have
[1:22:46] access to and that is verse six we drop
[1:22:50] to verse six he said there was a day
[1:22:53] when the sons of God came to present
[1:22:54] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[1:22:56] came also among them now this this uh
[1:23:01] scene that we're reading about right
[1:23:02] here is something that job is not privy
[1:23:05] to he's not aware that this is going on
[1:23:08] job is just carrying on and conducting
[1:23:10] his life and doing his thing and so he's
[1:23:13] there and Satan comes among into this
[1:23:17] little meeting that's going on and verse
[1:23:20] 7 the Lord said un to Satan when thou
[1:23:23] comest thou and Satan answered the the
[1:23:25] Lord and said from going to and fro in
[1:23:27] the earth and from walking up and down
[1:23:28] in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast
[1:23:31] thou considered my servant
[1:23:34] job and now this is God speaking hast
[1:23:38] thou considered my servant job there is
[1:23:40] none like him in the earth a perfect
[1:23:43] this is God now God is calling a
[1:23:46] man born in sin he's calling this man
[1:23:50] job who's no different than you and I
[1:23:52] just a
[1:23:53] man perfect and upright man one that
[1:23:56] fearth God and asseth
[1:23:58] Evil job's trial
[1:24:01] started with God prompting
[1:24:05] Satan there in that realm I'm saying
[1:24:08] have you ever thought basically have you
[1:24:11] ever thought about job have you ever
[1:24:13] thought about testing job have you ever
[1:24:15] thought about seeing if you can cause
[1:24:17] job this is just me paraphrasing he's
[1:24:19] not saying all those words there but
[1:24:22] he's he's setting up this scene he's
[1:24:25] making a way Satan would love to test
[1:24:28] job I'm sure he's always wanted to test
[1:24:30] job but remember Satan can't do anything
[1:24:32] that God doesn't
[1:24:34] allow he can't he can't do anything to
[1:24:36] you that God doesn't allow and so we we
[1:24:39] say well the devil is after me and this
[1:24:41] and that but but he can't do one thing
[1:24:43] that God doesn't
[1:24:45] allow But Not only was God going to
[1:24:48] allow him to be tested he was basically
[1:24:51] baiting Satan in here he was basically
[1:24:54] offering up
[1:24:56] job uh you know job's not aware of this
[1:24:58] at least at this point that we you know
[1:25:00] that's that's the way tests work you
[1:25:02] know you don't get the answers you don't
[1:25:03] know about those things you find out
[1:25:05] later you go to school do a test you
[1:25:07] know you're presented with the problem
[1:25:10] you don't have the answer you're
[1:25:11] supposed to provide the answer well job
[1:25:13] job doesn't know this is coming and God
[1:25:15] doesn't come down and tell him by the
[1:25:16] way job I'm going to set you up you're
[1:25:18] going to have a little test next week no
[1:25:20] job's not aware he just going along his
[1:25:23] day-to-day business meanwhile in heaven
[1:25:25] there's this conversation going
[1:25:28] on and I would like to submit to you
[1:25:30] that probably job's not the only one
[1:25:32] that God's had that conversation about
[1:25:35] you know and so you might be going along
[1:25:38] brother Bob's you know seemed pretty
[1:25:40] happy we had good Fellowship
[1:25:41] today but you know God and Satan there
[1:25:44] could be another conversation going on
[1:25:46] and you might be in the middle of that
[1:25:48] conversation and tomorrow your day might
[1:25:51] change
[1:25:53] have you considered my servant Bob
[1:25:56] coffee a perfect
[1:25:58] man upright man or one of you you don't
[1:26:01] know that and and we've all experienced
[1:26:04] that our day starts out good and all of
[1:26:06] a sudden something happens had no idea
[1:26:08] where did this come from where did this
[1:26:10] problem come from and you're doing the
[1:26:13] best you can I've been doing pretty good
[1:26:14] and all of a sudden you get hit with
[1:26:15] something in your life could be sickness
[1:26:17] it could be some other trial where did
[1:26:20] that come from Jo was in the same boat
[1:26:23] he didn't know this was coming and so
[1:26:26] God
[1:26:27] releases you know takes the Hedge away a
[1:26:30] little bit you you all know these
[1:26:32] scriptures and and he lets Satan try job
[1:26:36] first day one day you can read all the
[1:26:39] different things he did took his
[1:26:40] children all kinds of stuff just in a
[1:26:42] day he did all these
[1:26:43] things testing job but you see God knew
[1:26:47] what job would
[1:26:48] do he knew how job would respond before
[1:26:52] he
[1:26:53] responded when I look at that I'm
[1:26:55] thinking if that happened to me what
[1:26:56] would I do but see God knew what job
[1:26:59] would do and so one thing that we we
[1:27:02] have confidence in and well there's a
[1:27:03] couple scriptures we'll look at is that
[1:27:05] God knows you as well and so you look at
[1:27:07] that and say well if if that happened to
[1:27:09] me I don't know if I could do that but
[1:27:10] God is not going to test you the Bible
[1:27:13] says that too above what you're able to
[1:27:15] bear so he knows what level you're at
[1:27:18] but but you know in order for you to
[1:27:20] progress even in school you know you go
[1:27:22] to school and you learn things and
[1:27:23] you're taught this and you're taught
[1:27:24] that but you don't really to really know
[1:27:26] if you've absorbed what you've been
[1:27:28] taught you've got to be tested that's
[1:27:30] why they test you you you learn math or
[1:27:32] different things and and so they'll set
[1:27:34] you down and they'll throw a test at you
[1:27:37] and that test will really you might
[1:27:38] think you got it you might think yes I I
[1:27:40] know exactly I understand it and then
[1:27:43] you get the testerone at you and then
[1:27:45] you look at it and maybe you didn't
[1:27:47] understand it as well as you thought or
[1:27:49] maybe you did but God knows before the
[1:27:52] the test comes every test that God
[1:27:54] brings your way you're capable of
[1:27:57] passing because you've already got what
[1:27:59] you need but those tests are designed to
[1:28:01] build and same with school you build and
[1:28:04] you build and you build one on top of
[1:28:05] the other and that's the way God works
[1:28:06] and so he knows what level you're at he
[1:28:08] knows what kind of a test is going to be
[1:28:11] just the right test to allow you to make
[1:28:13] another step because everything that God
[1:28:15] brings your way every test he brings
[1:28:16] your way is to move you higher it's not
[1:28:18] to knock you down it's not to to set you
[1:28:21] backwards but it's to move you
[1:28:23] forwards and so he knows how to
[1:28:26] test but we need to be aware we we
[1:28:29] should not we should we should
[1:28:30] understand we should not be surprised as
[1:28:32] we as the scripture says you know the
[1:28:35] fiery Trials Come different things come
[1:28:37] we should not be surprised we should not
[1:28:38] be caught off guard we know that as
[1:28:40] Christians God's going to allow that
[1:28:42] because it's part of our walk it's part
[1:28:45] of our development that God wants to to
[1:28:48] bring in our in our in our life
[1:28:52] but you know when we go through those
[1:28:55] things one of the hard Parts about
[1:28:56] testing is you know when you're tested
[1:28:59] again I go back to school you know
[1:29:01] you're you're on your own in a test or
[1:29:04] at least it appears you're on your own
[1:29:05] certainly in in in the natural you're on
[1:29:07] your own well sometimes in these
[1:29:10] spiritual tasks that we go through it it
[1:29:13] seems like we're on our
[1:29:15] own and so I want to read a couple of
[1:29:17] scriptures in Isaiah 50 and because you
[1:29:19] know we call ourselves Children of the
[1:29:21] light the Bible says we are children of
[1:29:23] light and so the idea of being in
[1:29:25] darkness is is a is a concept that
[1:29:28] doesn't really make sense to us but
[1:29:29] there's a scripture in Isaiah 50 and10
[1:29:32] that I want to read because it speaks
[1:29:35] about something that we might think is
[1:29:37] how could this be Isaiah 50:10 it says
[1:29:40] who is among you that feareth the Lord
[1:29:44] so understand who that that it's
[1:29:46] speaking about it's not talking about
[1:29:47] the sinner but who among you is he that
[1:29:51] feareth the Lord that fearth the Lord
[1:29:53] obeys the voice of his servant so now we
[1:29:56] we kind of understand who we're talking
[1:29:57] about who is that person that walketh in
[1:30:01] darkness and has no light and so you
[1:30:04] look at that and you say well how is
[1:30:06] that possible we're children of Light
[1:30:07] how could we walk in darkness but it's
[1:30:09] not talking about walking in false
[1:30:13] Doctrine or walking out there no it's
[1:30:16] talking about this kind of situation
[1:30:19] where we come across something in our
[1:30:22] life yes we're children of light but God
[1:30:24] sometimes brings allows things to come
[1:30:26] our way and we enter sometimes into a
[1:30:29] place where we don't know exactly what
[1:30:31] it's about and we can't see the way
[1:30:34] forward it's that situation the
[1:30:36] situation of trial when God brings the
[1:30:38] trial and all of a sudden we don't
[1:30:41] actually know maybe when it first comes
[1:30:43] upon us what is this about and how where
[1:30:46] do I go from here I feel like I'm in a
[1:30:49] dark place and God does that on purpose
[1:30:53] sometimes he puts us in these situations
[1:30:56] where for a moment we're looking and we
[1:30:58] we can't see the way for we can't even
[1:31:00] see we don't know what this is about we
[1:31:02] feel like we're in darkness and God
[1:31:04] hasn't warned us about it because it's a
[1:31:06] test he hasn't warned us he hasn't told
[1:31:08] us I don't know why this is coming I
[1:31:10] didn't anticipate this happening to me
[1:31:13] it's a test it's a trial you're walking
[1:31:16] in darkness and you have no light but
[1:31:17] here's what it says for you to do
[1:31:19] because this is not speaking to speaking
[1:31:21] of about you and me it says let him
[1:31:24] trust or her let him trust or her Trust
[1:31:28] In The Name Of The Lord that's because
[1:31:31] what is what is it talking about when
[1:31:32] it's talking about trust it's talking
[1:31:33] about faith in those trials because
[1:31:37] Faith you know Faith doesn't really
[1:31:39] serve much purpose if you don't have a
[1:31:42] problem if you're you know I I'm
[1:31:44] standing here tonight and I I don't I'm
[1:31:45] not sick I I feel pretty healthy so I
[1:31:48] don't need faith for healing because I'm
[1:31:51] not sick but but if I get sick and I
[1:31:53] want God to to heal me that's when my
[1:31:56] faith goes to work faith is the Bible
[1:31:59] says a substance of things that we hope
[1:32:00] for the evidence of Things Not
[1:32:03] Seen when we're in a trial and we don't
[1:32:05] know where to go you know God puts us in
[1:32:08] those places where where we have to
[1:32:09] reach out and we have to put trust we
[1:32:11] have to have faith and those those are
[1:32:13] things that we're not comfortable doing
[1:32:15] we want to we want to have control of
[1:32:17] everything and we want to to make the
[1:32:19] next step and know just what we're doing
[1:32:21] but sometimes God places Us in in
[1:32:23] situations where we don't know where to
[1:32:24] go and all of a sudden now we got to
[1:32:26] look up and we got to put trust or
[1:32:28] exercise our faith in God to say I don't
[1:32:32] know where to go from here but it says
[1:32:34] here let him trust in the name of the
[1:32:36] Lord and stay upon his God that's the
[1:32:40] counsel here in Isaiah 50:10 that we do
[1:32:42] that and so it is that when we're in
[1:32:44] these trials and then as we put our
[1:32:46] trust in God you know somewhere along
[1:32:49] the way through this through your trial
[1:32:50] and through my trial God will begin to
[1:32:53] bring some light and begin to open a way
[1:32:55] and and let us know the direction that
[1:32:57] we need to go but you know he doesn't
[1:33:00] always give us the whole the whole light
[1:33:02] the whole pathway you know there's a
[1:33:05] scripture speaks about walking in the
[1:33:07] light as he is in the light and and you
[1:33:09] know if you're out it's dark now if you
[1:33:12] go outside and you were to go out away
[1:33:14] from all the natural lighting into the
[1:33:16] woods and down a trail somewhere and you
[1:33:18] had a flashlight with you you know you
[1:33:20] you you put that light on and and you
[1:33:22] that light allows you to see ahead so
[1:33:25] far depending on the depending how good
[1:33:27] a light you have you may see 10 ft maybe
[1:33:29] you see 20 ft but you know you don't see
[1:33:31] the whole pathway you only see so much
[1:33:34] so if you want to know where to go you
[1:33:36] got to walk in the light and you walk in
[1:33:38] that light you go 10 feet you go 20 feet
[1:33:40] and then you can see another 10 feet or
[1:33:41] 20 feet well it's kind of that way we
[1:33:43] serving the lord the Lord doesn't always
[1:33:46] lay out the whole pathway I can see
[1:33:47] where this is going a lot of times you
[1:33:49] don't know where it's going but you know
[1:33:51] The Next Step you have to make or the
[1:33:53] next couple of steps you have to make
[1:33:55] and you know what you're not going to
[1:33:56] see any more till you make those steps
[1:33:58] same as in the natural if I want to know
[1:34:00] what's at the end of the trail I've got
[1:34:02] to walk in that light and then as I go I
[1:34:04] see a little further oh there's a turn I
[1:34:05] got to turn up here I got to go there
[1:34:07] same way serving the lord we want to see
[1:34:10] the whole thing laid out to know exactly
[1:34:12] how it all comes together it doesn't
[1:34:14] work like
[1:34:15] that God leads us one step at a time one
[1:34:18] day at a time
[1:34:22] job in the middle of this trial that he
[1:34:24] was in Imagine job a man of God was
[1:34:27] righteous man made and prayed and all of
[1:34:29] these things in his darkest moments and
[1:34:32] like Isaiah
[1:34:34] 50:10 when we get sometimes into these
[1:34:36] deeper trials one of the things that's
[1:34:39] most difficult for us is that when we go
[1:34:43] to reach out to God in the middle of
[1:34:44] this deep trial we sometimes have
[1:34:47] trouble to find
[1:34:48] him we sometimes sometimes it's easy but
[1:34:52] sometimes we can be in a place like
[1:34:55] job job I want to go to job
[1:34:58] 23 job was in this this situation where
[1:35:01] he tried when he got to a certain point
[1:35:04] in his trial he tried to find God he
[1:35:08] wanted an audience with God and you know
[1:35:10] that's what we would do
[1:35:12] too but job found himself now that
[1:35:15] wasn't it didn't last forever no trial
[1:35:17] that God brings your way is going to
[1:35:19] last forever we need to understand that
[1:35:20] whatever comes your way if God brings
[1:35:22] you to it he's going to bring you also
[1:35:24] through
[1:35:25] it you've got to have faith in that but
[1:35:27] here's job understand that this can also
[1:35:29] happen I bring this here because it it
[1:35:31] happened to job it can happen to you can
[1:35:33] happen to me job
[1:35:35] 23 verse 8 through to
[1:35:40] 10 job's looking for God he says behold
[1:35:44] I go forward but he's not there so job
[1:35:47] is earnestly trying to find God because
[1:35:50] he knows that God has has the answers he
[1:35:52] said I go forward but he's not there and
[1:35:54] he said and I go backward but I cannot
[1:35:57] perceive him now job is aware that God
[1:35:59] is somewhere and he's trying to find him
[1:36:02] he said I go forward and I go backward
[1:36:04] but I cannot perceive him he said then
[1:36:06] he said on the left hand where he does
[1:36:09] work but I cannot Behold Him and then he
[1:36:12] acknowledges something that's it's
[1:36:14] almost sad to hear it but true as it was
[1:36:16] he said he hideth himself on the right
[1:36:19] hand that I cannot see him so job is is
[1:36:23] is even acknowledging that you know God
[1:36:24] could be visible if he wanted to but he
[1:36:27] has chosen at this moment to hide
[1:36:29] himself I'm looking for him I want to
[1:36:31] see him I want to talk but he's chosen
[1:36:33] to hide
[1:36:34] himself where I can't see him brother
[1:36:37] brandom had those situations too where
[1:36:38] he sought for God and it's like God
[1:36:40] wasn't anywhere and different ones in
[1:36:41] the Bible you know go through those
[1:36:43] periods we all go through those times
[1:36:45] and we're we're in a trial and we want
[1:36:47] God to to step in and sometimes there's
[1:36:50] a period that goes by where we can't
[1:36:52] seem to find him but job had a great
[1:36:55] Revelation that we also need to
[1:36:58] have verse 10 but he knoweth the way
[1:37:03] that I
[1:37:05] take he knows the way that I take and so
[1:37:09] you're in this pit you cannot see your
[1:37:11] hand in front of you you don't know
[1:37:13] where to go but God knows exactly where
[1:37:16] you
[1:37:18] are and he's allowed you to be there and
[1:37:20] he's not intending to keep you in the
[1:37:22] dark no but the Bible says job says he
[1:37:27] said he knows a way that I take and when
[1:37:29] he ha tried me I shall come forth as
[1:37:32] gold he knew this wasn't going to last
[1:37:34] and you could be in a trial or not but
[1:37:37] if you are and when you are because if
[1:37:39] you're a Christian you're going to go
[1:37:40] through them it's not going to last
[1:37:42] forever it's going there's going to be a
[1:37:43] win there's going to be a when it's over
[1:37:46] it's not always that way remember it's a
[1:37:48] land of hills and Valley so you could be
[1:37:50] in a valley right now but but you're not
[1:37:52] going to stay there but you also don't
[1:37:54] stay on the mountain top either you know
[1:37:56] we get up in the mountain top we don't
[1:37:57] want to leave but we have a journey and
[1:38:00] the journey to one mountain requires you
[1:38:03] to go through a valley sometimes to get
[1:38:05] to the next one we're on a journey but
[1:38:07] God will take us
[1:38:09] through every Mountain he'll bring us up
[1:38:13] every Mountain he'll bring us through
[1:38:14] every Valley it's the kind of God that
[1:38:17] we serve but you know when we're in
[1:38:19] those situations we don't always feel as
[1:38:22] strong a lot of you know we don't look
[1:38:24] at ourselves the way God does I think
[1:38:27] about Gideon in the Bible when they were
[1:38:29] you know impoverished with the
[1:38:31] Philistines I believe it was that were
[1:38:32] after them and and here comes a man of
[1:38:34] God to Gideon and and Gideon was himself
[1:38:38] a man of God the angel of the Lord I
[1:38:39] believe it is come in the form of a man
[1:38:41] to Gideon and he says you know uh he
[1:38:44] said the Lord is with thee thou Mighty
[1:38:47] Man of Valor well you know what if if
[1:38:51] you ask Gideon if he thought he was a
[1:38:52] mighty man of Valor I would say he would
[1:38:54] say absolutely
[1:38:56] not CU he went on to say well if God be
[1:38:59] with us why is all of this befallen us
[1:39:01] so he didn't see that he didn't see
[1:39:03] himself in that condition you don't
[1:39:05] often when you're in trial especially
[1:39:07] see yourself as a Victorious Christian
[1:39:09] you feel like you're defeated maybe but
[1:39:11] God doesn't look at you the way you look
[1:39:13] at yourself he's looking at you through
[1:39:15] the word he's looking at he's seeing
[1:39:17] what what he's intending for you to be
[1:39:19] and he's and he's moving with each test
[1:39:21] and trial towards that state and that
[1:39:24] condition it's his desire to do
[1:39:27] that everything that he brings is for
[1:39:31] our
[1:39:32] profit and so these kinds of things
[1:39:35] these are the real Trials of faith that
[1:39:37] Peter is speaking about that we read in
[1:39:39] our opening scripture and so it isn't
[1:39:42] and it shouldn't be as it says also in
[1:39:44] Peter in 1 Peter
[1:39:46] 4: 12- 14 it said it says to think it
[1:39:50] not strange
[1:39:51] 1 Peter 4:12 think it not strange
[1:39:54] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:39:56] try you as though some strange thing
[1:39:58] happened to you but sometimes we do
[1:39:59] think it strange sometimes we think why
[1:40:02] am I going through this why did this
[1:40:03] happen and it happens to all of us and
[1:40:05] even people who served the Lord a long
[1:40:08] time you know brother car lost his wife
[1:40:09] not you know almost two years it's been
[1:40:12] almost two years it will be this may and
[1:40:14] you know all that he's gone through I
[1:40:16] look at that sometimes and I think he
[1:40:18] he's going to be 94 next month and and
[1:40:20] here at that age after he's gone through
[1:40:23] many things and God has delivered him
[1:40:25] and still he gets this trial he calls it
[1:40:28] his biggest thing he's ever gone through
[1:40:29] and you think well it doesn't seem fair
[1:40:31] you know when you look at it in your
[1:40:34] human self why would why wouldn't God
[1:40:36] just you know we have these things and
[1:40:37] we don't want but but but the Bible says
[1:40:39] think it not strange think it not
[1:40:41] strange God allows that why we don't
[1:40:45] know we don't understand you know the
[1:40:47] purpose of it but we have to be we have
[1:40:50] to trust that God
[1:40:51] well we do know God knows what he's
[1:40:53] doing but certainly that God has a good
[1:40:55] intention even in that and you know we
[1:40:57] can see I can see the difference you
[1:40:59] know I can see in the ministry and God
[1:41:01] is still continuing to use him we
[1:41:02] appreciate what God is doing but you
[1:41:05] know would I want to experience that
[1:41:07] what would I do and we all look at those
[1:41:09] things say why why but but the Bible
[1:41:11] says here think it not strange as though
[1:41:14] something strange thing happen to you
[1:41:15] but rejoice in fact it says to Rejoice
[1:41:17] well that's hard to do that's hard to do
[1:41:20] in the middle of the trial you can
[1:41:21] Rejoice after you're over and you get
[1:41:23] back on the mountain again but he's
[1:41:25] saying even when we're going through it
[1:41:27] that we should have that attitude to
[1:41:28] rejoice in as much as you are partakers
[1:41:31] of Christ's sufferings that when the
[1:41:33] glory shall be revealed you may be glad
[1:41:34] with exceeding
[1:41:36] Joy you know uh one of these days we
[1:41:41] will be past this and this life right
[1:41:44] now seems big and it's all we know but
[1:41:48] one of these days it will be over and
[1:41:49] sooner than later and I know brother
[1:41:51] Carr talked about his when he talked
[1:41:53] about his wife and being married 70
[1:41:54] years they celebrated 70 years just a
[1:41:57] couple months before sister car passed
[1:41:59] and you know he said it just seemed like
[1:42:02] a few moments of time he said it wasn't
[1:42:05] long enough you know and so when when we
[1:42:08] get over there you know there's a song a
[1:42:10] sister in our church used to sing you
[1:42:11] know the toils of the road will seem
[1:42:12] nothing when we get to the end of the
[1:42:15] way when this is over and we get on the
[1:42:18] other side even if we have the memory of
[1:42:20] all that we went through when we see
[1:42:22] what's there Beyond I I spoke at home a
[1:42:25] little bit recently about about what
[1:42:27] brother Bram said about beyond the
[1:42:28] curtain of time and I began to to look
[1:42:30] into what brother Brown said about that
[1:42:31] and it's and it's so amazing to think
[1:42:34] you know those people that have gone on
[1:42:35] before us uh the the Believers that have
[1:42:38] gone on before you know they're not in
[1:42:39] any distress they're not fretting
[1:42:41] they're not worrying they know we are I
[1:42:44] thought of sister uh Bram the hope that
[1:42:47] was there when brother brandham was
[1:42:49] allowed to see her he was so he was
[1:42:51] trying to take his life you remember how
[1:42:52] upset he was and here's a man that saw
[1:42:55] the power of God in his early Ministry
[1:42:57] and when he lost his wife and his
[1:42:58] daughter it was it was a very very
[1:43:01] serious time for him and and and so hope
[1:43:05] speaks to him there and I thought it was
[1:43:06] interesting you know because we can't
[1:43:08] see into that Dimension unless the Lord
[1:43:10] would allow but it seems though
[1:43:11] sometimes they can see into ours because
[1:43:13] she she told uh brother Bram she said
[1:43:16] you you have to stop worrying well how
[1:43:18] did she know he was worrying how would
[1:43:20] she be aware of that if she's in that
[1:43:22] Dimension but she was aware of it he
[1:43:23] said you got to stop worrying about us
[1:43:25] we're all right here no worries here you
[1:43:28] know so that's that there's no concern
[1:43:32] you know those of us that we lose when
[1:43:33] we weep and we mourn it's it's not about
[1:43:36] them they're in a good place it's for us
[1:43:38] that are left behind but one of these
[1:43:40] days we'll be there too you know we just
[1:43:43] have to get through this life and and so
[1:43:45] these trials are all about that are all
[1:43:47] about positioning us and getting us to
[1:43:49] that place where where we'll be ready
[1:43:51] but also uh getting us to that level
[1:43:54] where God desires us to be looking at a
[1:43:57] few other characters and uh Abraham you
[1:44:00] know was another man of God that we when
[1:44:03] we when we preach any time a message
[1:44:05] about faith is preached we almost always
[1:44:08] mention Abraham Abraham and faith we
[1:44:10] kind of put the two together what why do
[1:44:12] we talk about Abraham when we talk about
[1:44:14] faith what made Abraham's Faith
[1:44:16] significant was the fact that it was
[1:44:19] tested you know if God had to come down
[1:44:21] to Abraham said when he was old and said
[1:44:22] you're going to have a child and then 9
[1:44:24] months later the child was born we
[1:44:25] probably wouldn't talk a whole lot about
[1:44:27] Abraham's faith it God just did what he
[1:44:30] said he was going to do but but the
[1:44:32] thing with Abraham there were two great
[1:44:33] tests of his faith first one was years
[1:44:36] and years began to pass they kept
[1:44:38] getting older they kept getting older
[1:44:40] and here Abraham still stood and after
[1:44:42] 25 years here they are really old now
[1:44:45] you know and Abraham's still believing
[1:44:47] so his faith was tested that's why we
[1:44:49] talk about Abraham's faith because it
[1:44:50] was
[1:44:51] tested brother Brandon preached the
[1:44:53] message tested Faith produces goods
[1:44:55] tested faith not just Faith but tested
[1:44:58] Faith the other time that Abraham's
[1:45:01] Faith was tested when he was asked to
[1:45:03] sacrifice the very
[1:45:04] son that was promised to him he grows up
[1:45:08] to a certain point and God says you know
[1:45:11] uh the Bible says God tempted Abraham
[1:45:13] but the word tempt in that in the Hebrew
[1:45:15] really means test because God doesn't
[1:45:16] tempt the Bible says he doesn't doesn't
[1:45:18] tempt in that sense of it it was a test
[1:45:21] sends him up there and says you go slay
[1:45:23] your son make him a sacrifice well that
[1:45:24] doesn't even make sense Abraham didn't
[1:45:27] disagree he didn't contradict he didn't
[1:45:29] talk back he just went up fulfill ready
[1:45:32] to fulfill oh that that is that's you
[1:45:34] got to have faith to do that faith that
[1:45:37] somehow that God's going to do something
[1:45:40] and so he went up and did that and we
[1:45:41] see those those great tests of his faith
[1:45:44] that he passed those but those wouldn't
[1:45:45] have likely been easy for Abraham we
[1:45:48] don't know what went through his mind
[1:45:49] the Bible doesn't talk about about all
[1:45:50] of that but I'm sure it was not easy
[1:45:52] walking up that hill with his son
[1:45:54] knowing that he was going to have to
[1:45:55] inflict pain upon his son kill his son
[1:45:57] potentially and still not really sure
[1:45:59] how it was going to end but he did it
[1:46:02] anyways he did what God had told him to
[1:46:04] do he didn't know the outcome would be
[1:46:07] the way it was God didn't tell him you
[1:46:08] know he didn't give him the answer in
[1:46:10] advance he didn't know but God also knew
[1:46:13] as I said before God knows every time a
[1:46:15] trial comes he knows whether you're in a
[1:46:18] place to receive it or and a place to be
[1:46:21] able to deal with it and one of the
[1:46:23] scriptures that I always Drew strength
[1:46:25] from is in Psalms
[1:46:27] 103 Psalms 103 and 14 and we need to be
[1:46:32] mindful of this every time something
[1:46:34] comes our way as a
[1:46:36] Christian that God has this in mind for
[1:46:39] he knoweth our
[1:46:42] frame and rememberthe are dust so he
[1:46:45] knows our frame he knows how we're built
[1:46:48] and what we are able to to stand take
[1:46:52] take the natural example take a truck I
[1:46:54] have a half done truck you know that
[1:46:55] that's designed specifically engineered
[1:46:59] to to haul a certain load of course
[1:47:01] there's safety on it so you can go a
[1:47:03] little more but if you put too much of a
[1:47:05] load in that you're going to break it
[1:47:06] you're going to break something I had a
[1:47:08] trailer one time I was hauling out wood
[1:47:11] on and it was just a a homemade trailer
[1:47:14] and I loaded it up really good and I got
[1:47:16] partway out and the axle broke broke
[1:47:18] right in half well I had too much on it
[1:47:21] that frame wasn't meant for that kind of
[1:47:22] a load that much weight and so it's a
[1:47:25] but God knows our frame he knows your
[1:47:29] frame he knows mine he knows what you
[1:47:31] can handle so there as hard as it might
[1:47:33] seem when the trial comes we must look
[1:47:36] up and you know God
[1:47:37] knows that you were going to be able to
[1:47:40] handle that as hard as it was I preached
[1:47:42] this message one of the last times I
[1:47:44] preach it was in was in was in Maine
[1:47:47] actually a brother a pastor there had
[1:47:49] lost his son suddenly
[1:47:51] uh he just died died in his sleep and
[1:47:53] and he was so devastated that he he
[1:47:55] stopped preaching and two or three weeks
[1:47:57] after he passed he called me he said
[1:47:59] would you come and preach for me and
[1:48:02] when I went there I felt led to preach
[1:48:04] this message and and and I spoke to him
[1:48:07] there I said you know as hard as this is
[1:48:09] and I can't even imagine what that would
[1:48:11] be like but I said God brought this
[1:48:13] trial your way because he knew you were
[1:48:15] in a position to take it somewhere
[1:48:18] that's and he's back ministering and
[1:48:19] everything now but you know it could
[1:48:22] have that trial could have had the
[1:48:23] potential to destroy him you know if if
[1:48:26] if he if he let it it was it was hard
[1:48:28] and I can't even imagine it but I said
[1:48:30] God knew that that was going to happen
[1:48:32] and he knew that within you is the power
[1:48:36] to pass this task to overcome this and
[1:48:38] to get by this and he did get by it
[1:48:41] because God doesn't he knows our frame
[1:48:43] he knew his frame and he may not have
[1:48:45] felt like you might not feel like the
[1:48:47] trial that you go through sometime I
[1:48:49] don't know if I have have what it takes
[1:48:50] you do because God wouldn't give it to
[1:48:52] you if you didn't have what it took he
[1:48:55] knows where you're at he knows exactly
[1:48:57] where you're
[1:48:58] at so Faith you know we all need Faith
[1:49:01] the Bible says without it without faith
[1:49:04] it's impossible to please God so faith
[1:49:08] we must have absolutely but it's not
[1:49:11] that we have to have a lot you know the
[1:49:13] Bible says Jesus said if you have faith
[1:49:15] as a grain of mustard seed you can say
[1:49:16] to this mountain be moved so it's not
[1:49:18] it's not a great amount of faith brother
[1:49:20] brandom said if you've got faith enough
[1:49:21] to walk across the floor you've got
[1:49:23] faith enough for anything that God has
[1:49:25] promised so it's not about that it's
[1:49:28] it's just simple faith is it's not so
[1:49:31] much that but I want to give you brother
[1:49:32] Bram giv a really good example I'm sorry
[1:49:36] about
[1:49:38] that never had that happen
[1:49:43] uh somebody trying to call me I didn't
[1:49:46] have my phone
[1:49:48] off he said if you got faith enough to
[1:49:50] walk across the floor you got faith
[1:49:52] enough for anything that God has
[1:49:53] promised simple Faith just simple Faith
[1:49:57] but here's what brother Brown used this
[1:49:59] example about it and and explained
[1:50:00] because you think well if if it's that
[1:50:02] simple why don't we get everything we
[1:50:03] ask
[1:50:04] for well brother Bram
[1:50:08] said speaking about the word he and we
[1:50:11] know that faith comes by hearing and
[1:50:12] hearing by the word brother Bram said
[1:50:14] his word is a sword he speaks in Hebrews
[1:50:16] 4:12 and said the word of God is sharper
[1:50:19] than any two-edged sword Discerning the
[1:50:20] thoughts that's in the heart brother
[1:50:23] brandom said the only thing that can
[1:50:24] handle this sword is a hand and he said
[1:50:28] the only thing that can handle God's
[1:50:30] word is Faith so he said if the word is
[1:50:33] a sword he said then Faith holds it
[1:50:36] Faith holds it and grips it and he said
[1:50:39] it's like he said when when people are
[1:50:42] dueling if the two men meet with these
[1:50:44] knives and they dueling he said he said
[1:50:47] that's you and the devil trying to get
[1:50:50] you to doubt so you're grabbing the word
[1:50:53] you you look in there and there's a
[1:50:54] promise you're going through something
[1:50:55] and you grab a hold of a scripture and a
[1:50:57] promise brother B said if you can put
[1:50:59] yourself in the scripture there and if
[1:51:01] God did something for for somebody and
[1:51:03] you've put yourself in there then he can
[1:51:04] do the same thing for you but you have
[1:51:06] to believe that he will do that you've
[1:51:08] got to have the faith that he will do
[1:51:09] that so he said you grab that word and
[1:51:10] you're he said it's like dueling and he
[1:51:13] said it's he said that's you and the
[1:51:15] devil trying to get you to doubt now
[1:51:18] here's the thing brother Bram said the
[1:51:20] sword that you got might be ever so good
[1:51:23] he said it's a million times better than
[1:51:26] his yours yours because you have the
[1:51:29] sharp two-edged sword he said it's a
[1:51:31] million times better than his he said
[1:51:33] I'm going to tell you his is not even a
[1:51:36] sword he said it's a stick but yours is
[1:51:39] a
[1:51:40] sword so he has a stick and you have a
[1:51:44] sword but brother Brown said this if the
[1:51:47] hand that holds the sword is is weak the
[1:51:50] stick can overcome it so here's Satan he
[1:51:54] doesn't even have what you've
[1:51:56] got but if you don't have faith brother
[1:51:59] Brandon said if the hand that holds a
[1:52:00] sword is weak the stick can overcome it
[1:52:04] but he said no matter how little this
[1:52:05] hand is if it holds the word of God with
[1:52:08] faith there's nothing going to do it it
[1:52:10] can put anything
[1:52:13] down so that's all you know so so
[1:52:17] sometimes we look at the promise and we
[1:52:19] we have a hard time perhaps to believe
[1:52:21] to really grab a hold of that and say
[1:52:23] that's for me but if we can get that
[1:52:26] that faith and get a hold of that
[1:52:29] promise with that strong hand of faith
[1:52:31] that you're going to say that's my
[1:52:33] promise that's mine that's for me and
[1:52:37] then the devil because what You' got is
[1:52:39] so much more powerful but if your faith
[1:52:41] is weak in what you're trying to
[1:52:43] accomplish you have a word here of
[1:52:45] promise that can defeat Satan in any
[1:52:48] circumstance there's something in there
[1:52:49] there somewhere for your circumstance if
[1:52:51] you can grab a hold of it but if your
[1:52:53] hand is weak the stick he said because
[1:52:56] that's all Satan has got it's just a
[1:52:58] stick he said the stick can overcome it
[1:53:01] but he said he's holding it and you're
[1:53:03] holding it and he's fighting and you
[1:53:06] know and and the devil's locking hands
[1:53:08] with you and he's saying you know it's
[1:53:11] wrong don't believe it and you're trying
[1:53:12] to believe it that's that's how that's
[1:53:14] how it works that's how Satan works but
[1:53:18] you know with faith it's this testing of
[1:53:20] the faith God starts you know the trying
[1:53:22] of the faith the faith builds you know
[1:53:23] you you you approach God and you believe
[1:53:26] for something and and then God answers
[1:53:28] and you do something and then and then
[1:53:30] as you see God working you know it
[1:53:32] builds faith is like a muscle it's like
[1:53:34] it it needs to be exercised and so as
[1:53:37] you exercise just the same in the
[1:53:38] natural as you exercise you build
[1:53:40] strength as you exercise your faith and
[1:53:43] believe in God and you see God do this
[1:53:45] it gives you more faith to believe that
[1:53:47] God can do something
[1:53:48] else but if but you've got to you know
[1:53:51] brother BR said we want to go in a
[1:53:52] Rapture and sometimes people don't have
[1:53:54] enough Faith to heal a cold it's kind of
[1:53:56] like that sometimes that we well well
[1:53:58] we're supposed to have rapturing faith
[1:54:00] as we talk about well we're being tested
[1:54:03] our faith is being
[1:54:04] tested and you know it's not all about
[1:54:07] it's also not all about getting what we
[1:54:10] asked of God you know I I'm I'm sick and
[1:54:12] I want to be healed and I pray and
[1:54:13] that's faith and a lot of times people
[1:54:15] look at faith that way it's it's about
[1:54:17] getting something but but I want to talk
[1:54:20] about another aspect of Faith here in a
[1:54:22] little bit I hope I'm not have no idea
[1:54:24] how long I've
[1:54:25] been but I'm going to go a little
[1:54:28] further with these tests that come our
[1:54:32] way there's always an element of choice
[1:54:35] I said a while ago the brother Bram said
[1:54:37] that when we're placed on this Earth we
[1:54:39] cannot go through life without being put
[1:54:41] in positions where we have to make
[1:54:43] choices it's it's intentional God puts
[1:54:45] it that way we'd like everything to be
[1:54:47] laid out as I said before but that's not
[1:54:49] the way it work works but God puts us in
[1:54:50] places where we have to make decisions
[1:54:52] and choices all the way through life and
[1:54:55] so that's getting us involved you know
[1:54:57] it's not all just God programming us a
[1:54:59] certain way no God puts us in here we're
[1:55:01] free moral agents and he gives us the
[1:55:03] opportunity to make choices and so
[1:55:05] there's always with every test that God
[1:55:07] brings our way there's this element of
[1:55:09] choice involved and how we respond to
[1:55:13] that Noah in his day you know was told
[1:55:16] it was going to rain he was given on
[1:55:17] option you know this is the answer build
[1:55:20] an ark and so on well Noah believed but
[1:55:22] Noah couldn't just believe the message
[1:55:24] he had a job to do he had an arc to
[1:55:27] build and it's it's not just a matter of
[1:55:29] believing God sent a prophet that's not
[1:55:30] going to be enough God is going to put
[1:55:33] us into periods and circumstances in
[1:55:36] life where we've got to we've got to do
[1:55:38] something we've got to exercise our
[1:55:40] faith we got to go out and work and
[1:55:41] there's something that we have to
[1:55:43] do so so Noah the prophet said Noah
[1:55:47] heard this word and he said before the
[1:55:49] there was one drop of water that fell
[1:55:51] from heaven Noah saw the rain coming so
[1:55:54] Noah had faith in what he had heard
[1:55:57] faith comes by hearing Noah heard about
[1:55:59] the Judgment he had never saw rain but
[1:56:02] he believed what God had said never saw
[1:56:05] a cloud never saw any of that but still
[1:56:08] he made preparations according to what
[1:56:10] God had said he did what needed to be
[1:56:12] done he saw the rain coming he couldn't
[1:56:14] just wait it was in in Noah's situation
[1:56:17] he couldn't just wait and see he he
[1:56:19] couldn't be well God said this I'll just
[1:56:20] wait and see what happens no that's not
[1:56:22] the way it is God gives us that and then
[1:56:24] it's like okay what are you going to do
[1:56:26] about it now throws you in a trial what
[1:56:28] are you going to do about it now you
[1:56:29] have a choice you can do nothing but
[1:56:32] then that that's going to impact the
[1:56:33] result Noah could not just do nothing he
[1:56:36] had to build an ark there was an ark
[1:56:37] that was the only answer in his day was
[1:56:40] for that Ark to be built if Noah didn't
[1:56:42] build it God wasn't going to build it it
[1:56:44] was his job to build the ark God gave
[1:56:47] him a word he gave him a he gave him the
[1:56:49] the the the the blueprints of what he
[1:56:51] had to do but he still had to go do it
[1:56:54] and so in our trials too there's
[1:56:55] something we have to do there's things
[1:56:57] that we have to do to move forward and
[1:57:00] then God will do his part and so he he
[1:57:02] built the ark did all of that people
[1:57:04] criticized him but it didn't stop him
[1:57:06] because he had faith in what he had
[1:57:08] heard God always keeps his word but you
[1:57:12] know sometimes he lingers brother Bram
[1:57:14] talked about in the days of Noah he said
[1:57:16] sometimes God lingers he said you know
[1:57:19] we read the promise in the scripture
[1:57:21] about how it says you lay hands on the
[1:57:22] sick and they shall recover but brother
[1:57:24] Bram said you know he was praying one
[1:57:27] time he said you said that these signs
[1:57:29] shall follow them that believe but he
[1:57:30] said and you shall lay hands on the sick
[1:57:32] and they shall recover but he said you
[1:57:34] never said when you never said when well
[1:57:36] sometimes in our mind we think that when
[1:57:38] we pray if we don't get an instant
[1:57:39] answer that means that God says no that
[1:57:42] he's not going to answer well that does
[1:57:43] that's not necessarily at all what it
[1:57:46] means he said you never said when the
[1:57:48] scripture says they shall lay hands on
[1:57:50] the sick and they shall recover that's
[1:57:51] just a promise there there's no wi in
[1:57:53] there it's a promise well a lot of times
[1:57:56] it's put out there we exercise our faith
[1:57:59] and God lets it go because he's going to
[1:58:01] see how much Faith you got brother Brown
[1:58:03] said sometimes he lingers like he did in
[1:58:06] the days of Noah he did in the days of
[1:58:09] Moses he did Brother Bram said in all
[1:58:11] days he never told the Pentecostal
[1:58:14] people to go up to the city of Jerusalem
[1:58:16] and in 24 hours I'll give you the holy
[1:58:18] ghost He said T there until T there
[1:58:22] until you're ued so it's the same thing
[1:58:25] with with healing with anything else we
[1:58:28] have to stay and believe and put our
[1:58:30] faith out there until we receive what it
[1:58:33] is that we're asking of God for we just
[1:58:35] keep it out there whether it's one day
[1:58:37] two days or a month or however long it
[1:58:39] is if you're praying for your loved ones
[1:58:41] you know you might say it's been 10
[1:58:42] years well I guess I guess God's not
[1:58:44] planning on doing anything so I'll just
[1:58:46] stop well you can't do that we have a
[1:58:48] sister in our church her mother who's
[1:58:50] now passed on uh she had uh raised this
[1:58:54] girl she was actually her granddaughter
[1:58:55] but she raised her and and uh and she
[1:58:58] went on aot to the world well she prayed
[1:59:01] for her for not just a year or two or a
[1:59:03] few months she prayed for her for
[1:59:06] something like 50 years and it was
[1:59:10] probably SE uh six 7 years ago now she
[1:59:14] gave her heart back to the Lord and we
[1:59:15] baptized her the church she's now
[1:59:18] faithful faithful serving the lord 50 50
[1:59:21] years what if she stopped after 49 or 40
[1:59:24] you know she prayed for 50 years and and
[1:59:27] but and she was for she was around to
[1:59:29] see it she passed away just a two three
[1:59:32] years ago uh but you know sometimes
[1:59:34] they're not even around for that you
[1:59:35] know go sometimes God will answer
[1:59:37] prayers even after but still you can't
[1:59:39] give up you can't say well it's been too
[1:59:41] long it must be God must not be going to
[1:59:43] do it don't don't ever give up on these
[1:59:45] things especially things like that
[1:59:47] praying for your loved ones that's a
[1:59:48] promise there
[1:59:49] you don't you you need to hang on to
[1:59:52] that and so just just keep going I I
[1:59:55] want to look at Daniel uh I want to look
[1:59:58] at Daniel for a
[2:00:01] moment in his time of
[2:00:03] testing Daniel chapter
[2:00:06] 6 you all know the situation there they
[2:00:08] put a statute out they were trying to
[2:00:10] trap Daniel and and they put a law out
[2:00:12] there that they couldn't pray to any
[2:00:14] other God and so on and I want to just
[2:00:16] jump to verse 10 just to show you how
[2:00:18] Daniel respond because sometimes in
[2:00:20] these trials Satan is trying to push you
[2:00:21] into a corner and get you to respond a
[2:00:23] different way well Daniel Daniel's
[2:00:27] religion just wasn't in when things were
[2:00:29] going well but he was prepared no matter
[2:00:31] what it was that he was going to stand
[2:00:33] and the Bible says in verse 10 Daniel
[2:00:36] 6:10 when Daniel knew when Daniel knew
[2:00:39] the writing was signed they made sure
[2:00:42] Daniel knew so it wasn't that Daniel
[2:00:44] just made a mistake oh I didn't realize
[2:00:46] there was this law you think about you
[2:00:48] know Daniel was just praying he could
[2:00:50] have went into his closet and shut the
[2:00:51] door prayed in secret you know there's a
[2:00:53] scripture about that praying in secret
[2:00:55] and the father would seeth and he could
[2:00:56] have did that for 30 days and he would
[2:00:58] had no trouble but see that wasn't
[2:01:00] Daniel's practice Daniel would kneel on
[2:01:03] his bed his windows being open he just
[2:01:05] that was the way Daniel Prayed he wasn't
[2:01:06] going to change his routine for what the
[2:01:09] devil was trying to do he could have
[2:01:11] changed it he could have done something
[2:01:13] different but he didn't he said when
[2:01:15] Daniel knew the writing of he went into
[2:01:17] his house the windows being open in his
[2:01:18] ch and he kneeled upon his knees three
[2:01:20] times a day and prayed and gave thanks
[2:01:22] before his his God as he did a four time
[2:01:26] didn't change his routine didn't didn't
[2:01:28] do something to make it easier for
[2:01:30] himself no that was the way that he
[2:01:32] served the Lord he wasn't going to
[2:01:33] change his routine just because of the
[2:01:35] pressure that the enemy was putting upon
[2:01:37] Him pressure that God allowed him to
[2:01:40] do we same thing we're going to I'm
[2:01:43] going to skip this one three Hebrew
[2:01:44] children same thing they were put under
[2:01:46] pressure but they stood but I do want to
[2:01:48] get a couple of other examples before I
[2:01:50] close and I want to pick I want to look
[2:01:53] at Jesus because we don't often think
[2:01:55] about Jesus being tested but brother
[2:01:58] Brown said he was and the scripture said
[2:02:01] he was and I want to go to Mark chapter
[2:02:03] 14 so if I can just just take a few more
[2:02:06] moments on this Mark chapter 14
[2:02:08] beginning at verse
[2:02:10] 32 Jesus there come to a place it says
[2:02:15] which was named Gethsemane and he said
[2:02:16] to his disciples sit ye here while I
[2:02:18] shall pray and he took with him Peter
[2:02:20] and James and John and began to be so
[2:02:23] look at this these words here I mean
[2:02:25] there in the English it's kind of an odd
[2:02:27] use of of the word it said it began to
[2:02:29] be sore amazed so I looked the word up I
[2:02:31] said what do it mean to be amazed we
[2:02:32] don't we use that in a very different
[2:02:35] way but when I looked it up in the in
[2:02:37] the Greek it said that it meant
[2:02:39] terrified to alarm
[2:02:42] thoroughly well I look at that and you
[2:02:44] think well that was Jesus how is it
[2:02:45] possible that he could be terrified but
[2:02:47] remember he was he he was in all points
[2:02:49] tempted as we are he came in a body of
[2:02:51] Flesh you know he wasn't Superman if you
[2:02:53] shot you know if you if you stabbed him
[2:02:55] with a knife it wasn't going to bend and
[2:02:57] you know he had flesh just like you and
[2:03:00] me capable of feeling pain so if he if
[2:03:03] he was in all points tempted as we are
[2:03:06] then then we have to and it's hard for
[2:03:08] us to imagine that it would have to be
[2:03:10] reasonable to and we see it in the
[2:03:12] scripture that he could also experience
[2:03:14] fear in in his flesh we know that God
[2:03:18] has doesn't have no Fe fear and he said
[2:03:19] you know fear speaks about that but this
[2:03:22] word amazed in the scripture in the
[2:03:25] Hebrew sorry in the Greek means
[2:03:26] terrified to alarm thoroughly he was
[2:03:29] sore amazed and he began to be very
[2:03:31] heavy which means troubled or distressed
[2:03:33] or anguished or depressed so he
[2:03:37] experienced tremendous just like you and
[2:03:40] I if you can imagine getting ready
[2:03:42] knowing what's coming he knew what was
[2:03:44] coming and he also knew that he wasn't
[2:03:46] going to escape
[2:03:47] it yet
[2:03:49] remember we said there was a choice
[2:03:52] watch what he prays verse
[2:03:55] 34 sayith unto them my soul is exceeding
[2:03:58] sorrowful sorrowful unto death te ye
[2:04:00] here and watch and he went forward a
[2:04:01] little the Bible says he fell on the
[2:04:04] ground didn't say he kneeled down and
[2:04:05] said he fell on the ground he was under
[2:04:07] tremendous weight a tremendous pressure
[2:04:09] it wasn't an act what Jesus did for us
[2:04:13] was not an
[2:04:14] act he prayed that if it were possible
[2:04:17] the hour might pass from him watches
[2:04:19] notice this prayer in verse 36 and he
[2:04:22] said Abba Father all things are possible
[2:04:25] unto thee notice this first part take
[2:04:28] away this cup from me and there's a
[2:04:32] pause there in the writing take away
[2:04:35] this cup for
[2:04:37] me what if he had a stopped there what
[2:04:40] if there was no end to that verse what
[2:04:42] if he what if he had to stopped there
[2:04:43] what would the father have done because
[2:04:45] remember the prophet said we were put
[2:04:47] into these situations of choice and so
[2:04:50] now he's asking his son is asking the
[2:04:53] father take this cup away from me and he
[2:04:55] stops there he just stops right there
[2:04:57] for a moment how how long doesn't
[2:04:59] doesn't say but there's a pause in there
[2:05:02] what if he had stopped there where would
[2:05:04] we be where would Our Hope be but he
[2:05:07] didn't stop there he said nevertheless
[2:05:10] but it's it's that choice that was
[2:05:11] presented nevertheless not what I will
[2:05:14] but what thou Wilt and brother B you say
[2:05:17] well I don't know if I see it that way
[2:05:18] let me read what brother Bram said in
[2:05:19] the message communion he said Jesus was
[2:05:22] here if there wasn't something that
[2:05:24] mattered in terms of Jesus response
[2:05:27] brother Bram wouldn't have spoke it this
[2:05:28] way he said Jesus was here confronting
[2:05:30] the greatest test test brother Bram said
[2:05:33] the greatest test that he ever had he
[2:05:36] was confronting the greatest test he
[2:05:37] ever had Gethsemane lay just before him
[2:05:39] once where that once and final all
[2:05:41] sufficient test must come when the
[2:05:44] burdens of the entire world laid upon
[2:05:46] his blessed shoulders he said there
[2:05:49] there was no one in all of Heavens or
[2:05:51] Earth could ever stood it but him what
[2:05:54] that tells me is that there's not a
[2:05:56] person on Earth that when they got to
[2:05:57] that place wouldn't have turned around
[2:06:00] wouldn't have taken the easy Road
[2:06:02] brother Brown said he was the only one
[2:06:04] that could have Ood it to know he said
[2:06:07] that all of the sins this brother Bram
[2:06:10] he said to know that all of the sins the
[2:06:12] past sins the present sins and the
[2:06:15] future sins rested upon and brother
[2:06:19] Brown says this rested upon this
[2:06:21] decision he called it a decision it was
[2:06:25] his
[2:06:26] decision all of the sins all of us
[2:06:29] sitting here tonight that are here
[2:06:30] because we believe that the Lord has
[2:06:32] forgiven us our sins all of it hinged on
[2:06:36] this prayer on this moment on this
[2:06:39] trial what was he going to do his
[2:06:41] decision rested upon this decision and
[2:06:44] he said it was one of the most greatest
[2:06:45] victories that Christ ever won or proved
[2:06:48] his great messiahship when he said to
[2:06:49] God not my will thine be done he said
[2:06:54] that was the greatest Victory he ever
[2:06:56] won all of the Demons of Torment he said
[2:06:58] were around to tempt him and to try him
[2:07:01] they were all there you imagine the
[2:07:04] pressure that he was under and then at
[2:07:06] that moment he makes that choice not my
[2:07:09] will but thine be done we wouldn't be
[2:07:12] here tonight if it wasn't for
[2:07:14] that well in a much much lesser way we
[2:07:17] are also thrown into things like that
[2:07:20] where we have to make
[2:07:21] choices and things happen and things
[2:07:24] come that are pure by designed to make
[2:07:27] us fail but they're actually designed to
[2:07:29] make us
[2:07:31] stronger our Prophet went through
[2:07:33] brother Brandon went through similar
[2:07:35] test we talked about a few moments ago
[2:07:37] if you just allow me to go just a little
[2:07:38] bit
[2:07:39] further he said I remember that great
[2:07:41] and final test that I had of my
[2:07:43] Christian experience this is in the
[2:07:45] brother brand in the same message
[2:07:47] actually communion the Great and final
[2:07:49] test I had of my Christian experience it
[2:07:51] was Yonder in the
[2:07:52] hospital out there and that was when his
[2:07:55] wife had had passed and his baby was
[2:07:57] there she had not passed just yet and he
[2:08:01] was there and he said the testings and
[2:08:04] trials were on he said he said it wasn't
[2:08:06] just somebody saying Billy you're a ho
[2:08:08] Holy Roller he said that's not much
[2:08:10] testing and these other little Trials of
[2:08:13] criticism from the men that I work with
[2:08:15] he said that wasn't much testing but he
[2:08:17] said my great hour of testing come when
[2:08:18] doctor ad dare uh come by and he met him
[2:08:22] and he said your baby is dying there's
[2:08:25] not a chance for it to live it's got
[2:08:26] tubercular
[2:08:28] menitis and and brother brand said
[2:08:30] surely not doctor surely not and and and
[2:08:33] here's a mother laying there a corpse he
[2:08:36] said so he kneels down and he prays with
[2:08:40] the doors closed and I said oh god
[2:08:41] father here's my wife and the baby's
[2:08:43] mother laying Yonder and The
[2:08:44] Undertaker's morg and Billy Paul's on
[2:08:46] the bed he's sick and my baby's done
[2:08:48] dying surely you won't take her I love
[2:08:50] her and she resembles her mother I want
[2:08:52] to raise her won't you please oh God
[2:08:54] spare my baby's life well how many
[2:08:55] people had brother bread and prayed for
[2:08:57] probably not even that earnestly that
[2:08:59] God raised up how many people he would
[2:09:01] have prayed for that was maybe even
[2:09:04] worse than that and he and and he so he
[2:09:06] had all of that behind him so it wasn't
[2:09:08] a lack of the faith to see God's hand
[2:09:11] move but it was a different type of
[2:09:13] faith that was being tested
[2:09:15] now so he prays that prayer and you can
[2:09:17] imagine what why now so God we got all
[2:09:20] the scriptures you know that would be
[2:09:21] there to say well you know if you're if
[2:09:23] if a son asked the father of a fish
[2:09:25] you're not going to give him so you
[2:09:27] would think here's God looking down why
[2:09:29] wouldn't he just why wouldn't he just do
[2:09:31] that but here's what brother random
[2:09:32] experienced like job he said as you all
[2:09:35] know I've been subject to Visions he
[2:09:37] said it seemed like a black sheep began
[2:09:38] to unfold coming down as if God took my
[2:09:41] prayer and threw it right back in my
[2:09:45] face and you know you and I have gone
[2:09:47] through I've gone through trials you
[2:09:49] probably have too where you've cried out
[2:09:51] to God about something and it seems like
[2:09:54] your prayer is not going nowhere well
[2:09:56] brother Bram experienced that
[2:09:57] too doesn't mean it isn't going anywhere
[2:10:00] but that's what brother brandham felt at
[2:10:01] that moment and not only that he didn't
[2:10:05] heal the baby either after him so
[2:10:08] earnestly praying he said it's like he
[2:10:09] threw the prayer back in my face and he
[2:10:11] prayed he said I'll do anything he said
[2:10:13] what have I done even after that brother
[2:10:16] Brown kept intreating god' he said' what
[2:10:18] have I done have I done something if I
[2:10:20] transgress your laws and if it is let me
[2:10:22] know I'll repent I'll do anything don't
[2:10:24] take my baby and then he said I saw she
[2:10:27] was going
[2:10:28] anyhow and then you know the black sheet
[2:10:32] the darkness like job the tempter comes
[2:10:35] right after of course he comes in those
[2:10:36] moments when when it seems like you're
[2:10:39] the weakest the tempter come to me the
[2:10:41] one that was there he said there was the
[2:10:43] one time here's what brother Brown said
[2:10:45] there was the one time in all my life
[2:10:47] that I can call was The crucial moment
[2:10:50] my Gethsemane my Gethsemane he said I
[2:10:53] was barely holding on to the bed and the
[2:10:55] devil said there you are there's the
[2:10:56] reward for trying to serve him you mean
[2:10:58] that he'll take that young 22y old
[2:11:01] mother and lay her Yonder in the corpse
[2:11:03] and that precious baby your own flesh
[2:11:04] and blood and slam your prayer in your
[2:11:07] face and you mean to say that you'll
[2:11:09] serve
[2:11:10] him and you know it was not a simple
[2:11:13] thing brother brandham said I was
[2:11:15] standing between opinions here's the
[2:11:17] decision again I was standing between
[2:11:20] opinions it had to be decided you know
[2:11:22] what's interesting he was in that place
[2:11:24] like we talked about walking in darkness
[2:11:27] can't find God God wasn't there
[2:11:29] Whispering brother brand doesn't even
[2:11:30] say anything about God whispering in his
[2:11:32] ear he just heard the Devil then so he
[2:11:35] was in that low point where looking for
[2:11:38] God looking for something that would
[2:11:40] give him some understanding but he said
[2:11:42] it had to be decided he couldn't let it
[2:11:44] go and then he said I put my hand on her
[2:11:47] head and he said I I said the lord gave
[2:11:50] and the Lord takes away blessed be the
[2:11:52] name of the Lord and when he did that
[2:11:54] brother Bram said I felt relief so God
[2:11:57] came in but it was a test God couldn't
[2:11:58] come in and give him relief until he
[2:12:01] passed that
[2:12:02] test he had to pass that he had to make
[2:12:05] that statement he had to go that far to
[2:12:07] make that statement and God probably
[2:12:09] wanted to he probably wanted to try to
[2:12:10] help him with it just like we do our
[2:12:12] children sometimes you know we see them
[2:12:14] struggling you know there's things that
[2:12:15] we can help them with but there's some
[2:12:17] things that they have to they have to
[2:12:19] make sometimes they have to make their
[2:12:20] own mistakes sometimes we have to let
[2:12:22] them do that it's the hardest thing to
[2:12:23] do we want to always protect them and do
[2:12:25] everything but sometimes the only way
[2:12:27] they're going to learn you know we you
[2:12:28] talk about the hot stove and the kid and
[2:12:30] you tell them don't touch don't touch
[2:12:32] well you know some kids are not going to
[2:12:33] learn till they touch
[2:12:35] themselves some are like that some if
[2:12:38] you tell them they'll listen to you
[2:12:40] other ones and we all know probably who
[2:12:42] they are we probably can think of people
[2:12:43] like that they have to touch the stove
[2:12:46] before they're going to learn well
[2:12:47] sometimes it God allows that for us too
[2:12:50] and so he let him go and and and and
[2:12:52] then of course he passed he passed this
[2:12:55] test and so it puts into that there puts
[2:13:01] the the scripture in Luke 18 and 18 into
[2:13:04] context there's a scripture in Luke 18
[2:13:07] where and this is the end of a parable I
[2:13:09] don't want to talk about the parable but
[2:13:10] I just you you you're probably familiar
[2:13:12] with it but he he talked about at the
[2:13:15] end of this Parable he makes a statement
[2:13:16] he said I I tell that he will avenge
[2:13:19] them speedily so I'm kind of at the
[2:13:21] middle of something but just notice this
[2:13:23] part nevertheless when the son of man
[2:13:25] cometh Luke 188 shall he find faith on
[2:13:29] the Earth shall he find Faith now that
[2:13:32] faith is not the kind of faith that you
[2:13:34] know when you lay hands on the sick they
[2:13:36] shall recover that's Faith all right the
[2:13:38] kind of Faith he's looking for is people
[2:13:39] that are still believing because the
[2:13:41] Bible tells us in Timothy that in the
[2:13:43] latter days some shall depart from the
[2:13:45] faith Satan is trying to tear away the
[2:13:48] faith that you have faith in this
[2:13:50] message faith in the gospel in the book
[2:13:52] of Jude it talks about in the that we
[2:13:54] need to contend for the faith that was
[2:13:57] once delivered to the Saints that's what
[2:13:59] that's what's at stake right now is is
[2:14:01] is our faith in this truth there's
[2:14:04] people out there talking the message
[2:14:05] talking The credibility of of the
[2:14:07] Prophet trying to discredit him and and
[2:14:09] so that if you can discredit the prophet
[2:14:11] then you just discredit the message and
[2:14:13] and there's pastors that have walked
[2:14:14] away and all of those different things
[2:14:15] that have taken place but God is going
[2:14:18] to have a people that are going to stand
[2:14:20] the test and they're going to keep the
[2:14:22] faith they're not going to lose they're
[2:14:23] going to contend and that word contend
[2:14:24] in Jude means to it's like wrestling you
[2:14:26] got to fight for it it's not going to be
[2:14:27] easy sometimes we're going to have to
[2:14:30] put an effort into it but God is going
[2:14:32] to have a people that are going to hold
[2:14:34] on to that Faith the Bible says he that
[2:14:36] endures until the end the same shall be
[2:14:40] saved there was a you all uh probably
[2:14:43] are I'm sure you're all familiar with
[2:14:45] this brother Brandon when he went to to
[2:14:47] Africa Africa to South Africa there was
[2:14:49] a book written of prophet visit South
[2:14:51] Africa by Julius stad club and his wife
[2:14:54] sister stads Club had a had a baby and
[2:14:56] they were good friends of brother Bram
[2:14:58] and the the baby lived for a while uh I
[2:15:00] don't know it was maybe a few months I
[2:15:01] can't I asked brother George one time
[2:15:03] not sure just how long she lived but uh
[2:15:05] the baby lived but then it died and they
[2:15:08] called brother brandom and said you know
[2:15:09] come come and pray and they they have
[2:15:11] her all ready to to hire you know to to
[2:15:14] get a plane to bring brother brandom
[2:15:15] over to pray for this baby
[2:15:19] well brother brandham you know they were
[2:15:21] friends but brother brandham was always
[2:15:23] conscious about these things to seek the
[2:15:26] will of God first and so brother Brandon
[2:15:29] went out and I remember reading this and
[2:15:31] I think I I don't know if I have yes I
[2:15:32] do have it here brother bandam went out
[2:15:35] imagine this now there are so many needs
[2:15:38] I we hear of needs all the time
[2:15:40] different ones sick and brother Daryl
[2:15:42] the other day I don't know if you know
[2:15:43] brother Daryl Ward but his sister has
[2:15:45] got cancer and he just sent me a message
[2:15:46] the other day she's she's uh uh they
[2:15:49] given up on her only given her three
[2:15:50] months to live well that's just one of
[2:15:53] many
[2:15:54] needs well here's one need brother
[2:15:57] brandom said I went out and I prayed all
[2:15:59] night and they weren't family they were
[2:16:02] just good friends he prayed all night
[2:16:03] for that one need I wonder the last time
[2:16:07] I prayed and you prayed all night for a
[2:16:10] need wonder if some have ever prayed all
[2:16:13] night for any need but you know we want
[2:16:15] God to do things but sometimes we're not
[2:16:16] willing to put the work and not willing
[2:16:18] to put the prayer in sometimes for these
[2:16:20] needs brother Brandon prayed all night
[2:16:23] and he said nothing happened he prayed
[2:16:25] all night and comes back in never got
[2:16:27] nothing he comes in and he's walking in
[2:16:30] the room he said and then the the light
[2:16:32] come over the door and told him he said
[2:16:34] don't put your hand on that don't rebuke
[2:16:36] that it's the hand of God now I won't
[2:16:38] get into that part of it but just the
[2:16:39] fact that it said don't rebuke it meant
[2:16:41] what did that mean brother brandham had
[2:16:43] some you know uh rapport with God in the
[2:16:46] sense that he might have been able to do
[2:16:47] something there but he he wanted God's
[2:16:49] will the Bible says you ask anything
[2:16:51] according to his will he hears us and
[2:16:53] you might think well it's a baby why
[2:16:55] wouldn't it be but God has a will so he
[2:16:57] calls sister stfb he said bury your baby
[2:16:59] it's the hand of the lord it's God's
[2:17:02] Will and sometimes that's hard I know
[2:17:04] we've had ones family the people that we
[2:17:07] know that have lost young children at
[2:17:09] times and tragic circumstances and it's
[2:17:11] like well why why would that happen you
[2:17:14] know and what does it mean how could
[2:17:16] that be but he said he he said it's it's
[2:17:18] the hand of the lord it's God's will
[2:17:20] something would happen to the baby down
[2:17:21] along the line leave it where God knows
[2:17:23] where it's at and
[2:17:25] so and so he he tells him that and then
[2:17:28] she comes by to visit some sometime
[2:17:30] after that a few months after they come
[2:17:32] over they're visiting brother brandham
[2:17:34] and here's the thing I want to talk as
[2:17:37] we're talking about the trial of your
[2:17:38] faith and as we try to wind down he said
[2:17:42] she comes over and asked brother
[2:17:44] brandham she said brother brandham was
[2:17:46] it was it my we weakness of Faith was it
[2:17:50] my weakness of Faith now the words that
[2:17:52] the baby wasn't it was just my faith not
[2:17:54] where it should be and brother Bram
[2:17:56] responded this way he said you have
[2:17:59] great
[2:18:01] faith you have great faith and here's
[2:18:03] here's how he describes it he said you
[2:18:05] have great faith you prayed for your
[2:18:07] baby you and your husband held on to it
[2:18:09] for God to raise the baby and he refused
[2:18:11] to do it because he knows what's best
[2:18:13] and you still love him he said that is
[2:18:16] real faith
[2:18:18] that's real Faith see he said anybody
[2:18:21] when the mountains are moving and things
[2:18:23] can have faith but he said Let It Go
[2:18:25] backwards one time and see how it works
[2:18:27] he said that's when you prove whether
[2:18:29] you have faith or not but see sometimes
[2:18:32] we think well it's if I pray and
[2:18:33] somebody's healed that means I got faith
[2:18:35] well that's that's that's one way of but
[2:18:37] sometimes it's the other way that God
[2:18:39] that's the kind of faith I think that
[2:18:41] when God is trying your faith it's more
[2:18:43] about that than it is about whether
[2:18:45] somebody receives healing or not
[2:18:48] he said that's when you prove you've got
[2:18:50] faith or not every son that cometh to
[2:18:52] God must be chasen and tried of God
[2:18:53] remember our trials Works patience and
[2:18:56] patience Works hope so he said we just
[2:18:57] hold on to God whether He blesses us or
[2:19:00] not we are right there to believe him
[2:19:02] anyway because he's promised
[2:19:05] it we've got to get to the place like
[2:19:10] Paul Paul
[2:19:12] said you know Paul Paul said in Acts 20
[2:19:17] vers 23 and 24 he comes you know he he
[2:19:20] gets the right Revelation there on the
[2:19:22] road to Damascus and everything and he's
[2:19:24] changed and but he says in the scripture
[2:19:27] he said the Holy Ghost witnessed to me
[2:19:28] in every city that bonds and afflictions
[2:19:30] abide me so so Paul had a revelation
[2:19:32] that trouble was going to be coming his
[2:19:35] way but verse 24 he said but none of
[2:19:39] these things move me see Paul understood
[2:19:41] it and we must come to that place too
[2:19:45] we'll get over one trial we'll come
[2:19:47] through we'll have a little Mountaintop
[2:19:48] experience and then we know we have to
[2:19:51] keep going and probably down the road
[2:19:52] there'll be another but God takes us
[2:19:55] through I already see that I've seen so
[2:19:57] much in my life now I know that no
[2:19:59] matter how much we strive we always
[2:20:01] strive for things to be better but
[2:20:03] there's always going to be things coming
[2:20:05] and we can't live in fear and worry and
[2:20:08] and fretting about what's coming no we
[2:20:10] just deal with the day that we're in now
[2:20:12] let God work with us in this day but not
[2:20:16] be moved that's the thing that Paul was
[2:20:18] he was in such a condition you know I I
[2:20:21] I read one time where it said Paul lived
[2:20:22] in you know everybody and Paul lived in
[2:20:24] this certain one but they say everybody
[2:20:26] lives in one of two tents either content
[2:20:28] or discontent you know we live in one of
[2:20:30] two tents and Paul was like that way
[2:20:33] I've learned in whatever state I am in
[2:20:34] there with to be content is another
[2:20:36] scripture and so we have to be that way
[2:20:38] whether we're in trial whether Paul was
[2:20:40] in prison you know we we read all these
[2:20:42] letters of Paul and he's so he's writing
[2:20:44] such inspirational words sometimes he
[2:20:46] was in house rest sometimes he was he
[2:20:49] was he didn't have his freedom when he
[2:20:51] wrote those things and we look wow what
[2:20:53] inspiring words Paul's conditions
[2:20:55] weren't very good when he wrote some of
[2:20:56] those inspiring words and some of the
[2:20:59] greatest inspiration some of the
[2:21:00] greatest songs that we sing that we get
[2:21:02] inspiration from that give us Faith are
[2:21:04] written by people that have gone through
[2:21:05] tremendous trials It Is Well with My
[2:21:07] Soul For example Oro spafford and
[2:21:10] different ones like that great trials
[2:21:12] and great
[2:21:15] testings but here's the thing and I'm
[2:21:17] going to close I I really am in
[2:21:19] Deuteronomy chapter 33 there's a verse
[2:21:22] of scripture that I would want want to
[2:21:25] bring to encourage us as we go through
[2:21:27] this life and we do encounter and if
[2:21:28] you're in the middle of a trial now it's
[2:21:30] approach that you need to take is not to
[2:21:32] try to look way far ahead and say well
[2:21:34] what's going to happen and where are we
[2:21:35] going to go what's going to happen
[2:21:36] tomorrow or next week don't worry about
[2:21:38] tomorrow or next week Deuteronomy 33 and
[2:21:41] 25 says this thy shoes shall be iron and
[2:21:46] brass and sometimes that's the way it
[2:21:47] feels when we go through life but I want
[2:21:49] you to notice this last half of the
[2:21:51] verse as thy and as thy days so shall
[2:21:55] thy strength be I believe you know this
[2:21:59] a song the Lord give me the strength to
[2:22:01] do every day what I have to do and
[2:22:02] that's what this is talking about I
[2:22:04] believe that each day you get down on
[2:22:06] your knees you know as Charles Spurgeon
[2:22:07] once said he said before you behold the
[2:22:10] face of man each day you should behold
[2:22:12] the face of God and when you do that you
[2:22:14] want God to give you that strength but
[2:22:17] just just for today let tomorrow and the
[2:22:20] be the Bible speaks about that take no
[2:22:22] thought for tomorrow if you read that
[2:22:23] scripture it means don't worry don't
[2:22:26] take anxious thought and so we don't
[2:22:28] it's not that we don't think about we
[2:22:29] have to plan there's things in our life
[2:22:31] we have to do but we never worry we
[2:22:32] should never worry about tomorrow we
[2:22:34] should never worry about anything but
[2:22:36] about tomorrow but but let God give us
[2:22:38] the strength today so so you've got this
[2:22:40] long trial you're going through well
[2:22:42] what what do I need today what do I got
[2:22:43] to do today how do I need to respond and
[2:22:45] let God give you that and then tomorrow
[2:22:48] when tomorrow comes God will give you
[2:22:49] the strength for tomorrow because as
[2:22:51] your days so shall your strength
[2:22:56] be amen I think I'm going to just stop
[2:22:58] there or I will go for a while so we
[2:23:00] don't want to do that Amen Let Us stand
[2:23:04] as they come to the instruments I don't
[2:23:07] know as I said it's one of the benefits
[2:23:09] of coming like here like this not
[2:23:11] knowing I have no idea where things are
[2:23:13] and where people are at but I I know
[2:23:15] that God knows all of us
[2:23:17] he knows our cares he knows our
[2:23:19] troubles he knows what we have need of
[2:23:22] and whatever trial and whatever test
[2:23:23] we're going through you know if we could
[2:23:25] just learn to trust God and cast our
[2:23:27] cares upon Him He he's there to always
[2:23:29] look after us there's a song I I didn't
[2:23:32] see it in your song I don't know if you
[2:23:33] know it or not but there's the song the
[2:23:35] god of the mountain is still God in the
[2:23:36] valley you know that one yeah maybe we
[2:23:38] can sing that life is easy when you're
[2:23:42] on the mountain but you know the god
[2:23:44] that we
[2:23:45] serve he he's not only around when
[2:23:48] there's when things are going well he's
[2:23:49] around in trouble you might not see him
[2:23:51] but he's always there he might be just
[2:23:53] out of sight but he's always there he's
[2:23:55] always around to help you when you're in
[2:23:58] need amen let's just try that song
[2:24:02] Together life is
[2:24:07] easy when you're up the
[2:24:13] m and you've got peace of
[2:24:18] mine like you've never
[2:24:23] known but then things
[2:24:26] change
[2:24:28] and you're down in the
[2:24:34] valley don't lose fa
[2:24:38] for you're never
[2:24:43] alone or The God on the
[2:24:48] Mountain he's still God in the
[2:24:54] valley when things go

[2:25:03] R and the god of the good
[2:25:08] times he still God in
[2:25:14] thead the god of the

[2:25:34] mountain the talk comes so
[2:25:39] easy when life
[2:25:42] [Applause]
[2:25:43] it but it's down in the
[2:25:49] of and
[2:25:54] Temptation that's when faith
[2:25:58] is really put to the
[2:26:03] de for the of the
[2:26:08] Mountain Still The
[2:26:11] [Music]
[2:26:14] Valley when things go wrong

[2:27:30] Lord amen thank the Lord let's uh enjoy
[2:27:34] the word tonight amen it's a it's what I
[2:27:39] call Rubber hits the road type of
[2:27:42] message right down to earth right it's a
[2:27:46] like
[2:27:47] preaching amen because it's reality
[2:27:50] right praise the Lord I really believe
[2:27:53] that amen let's saying it's uh I think
[2:27:55] it's
[2:27:56] 12:19 no longer a
[2:27:59] slave to fear and that's uh that kind of
[2:28:04] strikes me when brother was preaching
[2:28:06] because we as we know we said it times
[2:28:09] times before that it is fear that the
[2:28:12] devil uses against
[2:28:14] us and he throws and God on allows him
