[48:23] and certainly to ask you to remember
[48:24] continue to remember our brother bradley
[48:26] mcdonald in prayer in fort mcmurray
[48:30] and i have been trying to get contact
[48:32] our brother
[48:33] martin warner for for a while and uh
[48:37] but the email i got is not just not
[48:39] working
[48:40] so i'm praying that brother martin
[48:42] because brother martin did live in
[48:45] in fort mcmurray and i remember that i
[48:47] was there
[48:48] and i ministered because he had cottage
[48:51] meetings and that's why i ministered
[48:52] there
[48:52] maybe a couple of times two or three
[48:54] times a man he was using the garage that
[48:57] was attached to his house
[48:58] as a church a man so it was a wonderful
[49:02] time of fellowship that we had and i
[49:04] thank the lord for that
[49:05] but of course our brother martin has
[49:07] moved out of there
[49:08] and i think most are all the believers
[49:11] as far as i know moved out of there
[49:13] but our brother bradley and that is
[49:15] brother ron and sister shirley snow's
[49:17] grandson
[49:18] and so he's contacted me since he went
[49:20] to fort mcmurray
[49:22] and he wanted to know if there's any
[49:23] church believe believer church there
[49:25] message church there
[49:26] amen and i know it's been a while since
[49:29] i met brother bradley
[49:31] and uh he was only maybe just a teenager
[49:34] when i did meeting that meet him in
[49:36] inter brother ron's and sister shirley's
[49:39] but he had a nice spirit and a nice
[49:41] attitude so i pray god continue to bless
[49:42] him
[49:43] in fort mcmurray amen but again i did
[49:46] hear from some
[49:47] believer and i'm not short of his
[49:48] brother martin
[49:50] but they did inform me that they do have
[49:53] a son there
[49:54] and i understand i guess again that he's
[49:57] a believer this
[49:58] his son is a believer so i was trying to
[50:00] get contact to find out who it is and so
[50:02] i can pass it on to brother bradley
[50:04] so god's grace to our brother bradley
[50:07] amen that god will meet the need
[50:10] and that he will experience god's
[50:11] leadership in his life amen
[50:13] i would say i assume maybe he might be
[50:15] just maybe in his early 20s
[50:17] his age so god's grace to him so keep in
[50:21] prayer that we'll we will locate our
[50:22] brother
[50:23] martin i think he uh he ministers for
[50:26] brother
[50:29] fury right i think so but i i didn't
[50:31] have brother fury's
[50:32] email address so i'll try to contact him

[52:25] god continue with those brothers we
[52:26] still we don't want to lose that
[52:28] amen keep keep going amen
[52:32] and in matthew chapter 15
[52:35] and verses beginning at verse 29
[52:41] and it says and jesus departed from this
[52:45] and came nigh unto the sea of galilee
[52:48] and went up
[52:49] into a mountain and sat down there
[52:53] and great multitudes came unto him
[52:55] having with them
[52:56] those that were lame blind
[53:00] dumb maimed and many
[53:03] others and cast them down at jesus feet
[53:08] and he healed them praise the lord
[53:11] wonderful
[53:12] hallelujah insomuch that the multitude
[53:16] wondered when they saw the dumb to speak
[53:19] yeah the maimed to behold
[53:23] the lame to walk and the blind to see
[53:27] and they glorified the god
[53:29] of israel amen
[53:33] then jesus called his disciples onto him
[53:35] and said
[53:36] i have compassion on the multitude amen
[53:40] because they continue with me
[53:44] now three days and have
[53:48] nothing to eat and i will not send them
[53:50] away
[53:51] fasting lest they faint in the way god
[53:56] bless his word you may be seated
[53:58] amen amen
[54:02] and turn with me again to john chapter
[54:08] 8.
[54:10] jesus highlighted
[54:14] their faithfulness and jesus highlights
[54:17] our faithfulness to continue
[54:19] with him amen is not just to get in
[54:23] but it's to have that hunger and that
[54:24] thirst for
[54:27] watch what he what he's doing amen
[54:30] and that hunger and that thirst for what
[54:32] what you want him to do in your life
[54:35] praise the lord they were there for that
[54:37] hunger and thirst for what jesus could
[54:38] do
[54:39] they knew when it comes to salvation it
[54:41] was in jesus when it comes to healing it
[54:43] was in jesus name
[54:44] when it comes to doing this they needed
[54:46] jesus amen
[54:48] and again jesus called his disciples
[54:50] onto him and said
[54:51] i have compassion on the multitude
[54:54] because
[54:55] why because he said they continue
[54:59] with me amen he will have compassion on
[55:02] us
[55:03] if we continue with it amen if we stay
[55:06] with him
[55:06] if we're going to continue with the word
[55:08] if we're going to stay with the word
[55:10] amen
[55:11] in our hearts in our souls in our spirit
[55:13] not just in our heads
[55:15] and again let's pray the grace of god
[55:17] that again
[55:18] by grace as the prophet said to the
[55:20] those even in in
[55:21] branham tabernacle he said you're in the
[55:24] message but the message is not
[55:25] in you amen that's the truth so brother
[55:28] and sister there's many of many a
[55:30] so-called professing believer
[55:32] that's in the message but the message is
[55:34] not in them that's right
[55:35] amen because if the message was in them
[55:38] it would be reflected
[55:39] morning noon and night every day amen
[55:42] oh my grace praise the lord i i o lord i
[55:46] pray the grace of god that anointing in
[55:48] our hearts in our souls amen
[55:50] because i i remember back there some
[55:52] years ago when believers got together
[55:54] for worship
[55:55] oh yeah they were right into it amen
[55:57] worship not that they weren't into this
[55:59] and went into that but they're into the
[56:00] word
[56:01] amen they're into jesus by the grace of
[56:04] god and after
[56:05] after our service after we had a service
[56:07] oh my the saints would get together
[56:09] outside
[56:10] oh oh yeah they didn't get involved in
[56:14] the natural things of life
[56:15] that continued with what they started
[56:17] inside the church
[56:19] amen what was it oh they got together
[56:21] and they talked about the word
[56:22] talked about the lord talked about the
[56:24] resurrection talked with the rapture
[56:25] oh brother this is wonderful amen they
[56:28] were spiritual
[56:29] amen but there's too many that's just
[56:31] religious but not spiritual that's right
[56:33] amen and there there's a brother that's
[56:35] been that i've noticed us on the
[56:37] internet
[56:37] and he says sermons are there and and
[56:40] he's he's
[56:41] been preaching and preaching and
[56:42] preaching and preaching for many sermons
[56:44] already
[56:45] and maybe preaching the same thing today
[56:48] and
[56:48] asking the question concerning are you
[56:51] are you religious
[56:52] or do you have a relationship amen what
[56:55] are you working on what are you here for
[56:57] amen is because it's your religious or
[57:00] is it because of your relationship with
[57:01] jesus
[57:02] amen is your relationship with the word
[57:05] amen
[57:06] so i trust that we're all here because
[57:08] amen
[57:09] that we have a relationship with our
[57:11] lord jesus christ
[57:12] amen and brother if there's a
[57:14] relationship you want to maintain that
[57:16] relationship morning noon and night
[57:18] praise the lord it's just not on a
[57:20] sunday it's just not on a wednesday
[57:22] it says now i'm going to oh when i get
[57:23] up in the morning just ask the lord to
[57:25] bless me ask the lord to be with me no
[57:27] no
[57:27] you're gonna you're gonna continue in
[57:29] fellowship with him 24 hours a day
[57:32] amen that's the only way that you can
[57:34] say is the bible says
[57:36] it's not me that lives is christ that
[57:38] liveth in me
[57:39] amen and if christ is living in you

[58:21] what is the revelation to us when we go
[58:23] through that traffic light when we see

[1:06:27] because they wanted to put jesus down
[1:06:29] they wanted to do this they want to do
[1:06:30] that
[1:06:31] amen and jesus was looking for that same
[1:06:33] fanaticism in his disciples

[1:06:45] experienced and after all that they had
[1:06:46] heard jesus say and seen jesus do
[1:06:49] go to sleep goodness you wouldn't think
[1:06:52] you'd be able to sleep
[1:06:54] when you were around jesus you'd have to
[1:06:55] maybe just go somewhere else

[1:06:59] wanted he wanted them may oh
[1:07:01] oh you want them maybe to come and help
[1:07:03] him and pray with him no

[1:07:10] amen oh yeah one day they'd wake up and
[1:07:13] they wouldn't go to sleep no more
[1:07:15] amen when the holy ghost comes in
[1:07:18] brother you're not going to sleep
[1:07:19] spiritually
[1:07:20] not by any means you're going to be more
[1:07:22] and more conscious of what god

[1:08:25] and you were with jesus and you you
[1:08:27] loved jesus
[1:08:28] again as i was thinking just recently
[1:08:31] about when i when i
[1:08:32] went to an altar to get to call on the
[1:08:34] lord for salvation
[1:08:36] and it was it was in a a salvation army
[1:08:39] citadel
[1:08:39] and and the place was blocked with all
[1:08:42] mine
[1:08:43] it was full and and i was sitting in a
[1:08:45] seat there
[1:08:46] and i was sitting and i was crying
[1:08:50] near the end of the service i cried and
[1:08:51] cried and cried amen
[1:08:53] calling on the lord and then i i felt uh
[1:08:56] somebody touched me on my shoulder
[1:08:58] amen and and i turned around oh there
[1:09:01] was a sister standing in a seat behind
[1:09:04] me
[1:09:04] and she said brother gerald i said yes
[1:09:07] sister
[1:09:09] she said you need to go to the altar
[1:09:12] please brother stand up and go and bow
[1:09:15] yourself before him
[1:09:16] amen and that's what i did amen went out
[1:09:19] to the altar and by myself before him
[1:09:21] and after a while amen there was someone
[1:09:24] there got me up and they said well
[1:09:25] oh what happened oh i said i just got
[1:09:28] saved
[1:09:29] amen i said the lord saved me amen the
[1:09:32] lord gave me your salvation
[1:09:34] oh i said praise the lord amen and they
[1:09:37] begin to sing and praise the lord too
[1:09:39] amen so brother but now what god's
[1:09:42] looking for now is
[1:09:43] that we continue in it amen
[1:09:46] there's a beginning well let's go on the
[1:09:49] end of eternity
[1:09:50] amen continue in your relationship with
[1:09:53] god
[1:09:54] continue in your relationship with jesus
[1:09:56] continue in your relationship with the
[1:09:58] bride of christ
[1:09:59] with believers amen sons and daughters
[1:10:03] of god
[1:10:03] amen continue and jesus said they have
[1:10:07] continued with me
[1:10:08] he said they they heard me they saw me
[1:10:11] and now i said i've come this time in
[1:10:12] three days he said they have stayed with
[1:10:14] me
[1:10:15] brother where are we are we in our
[1:10:17] relationship now amen
[1:10:18] continuing with him amen still
[1:10:22] looking for the resurrection still
[1:10:24] expecting the rapture
[1:10:25] amen it's not start and again just is
[1:10:30] too bad that the message has become to a
[1:10:32] lot of people it's just
[1:10:33] the doctrines are creeds well we believe
[1:10:36] this we believe that
[1:10:37] brother what we believe is the living
[1:10:40] word of god
[1:10:41] made flesh in us amen it's not just
[1:10:44] ideas and thoughts that we have in our
[1:10:46] heads not ideas and thoughts that we
[1:10:48] would have in our minds no it's a life
[1:10:51] it's eternal life amen that's why again
[1:10:54] let me say it again as well you can say
[1:10:56] not me lives jesus living in me he is
[1:10:59] yes he talks through me and always he's
[1:11:02] living out the word through me
[1:11:03] amen he he's a witness through me
[1:11:06] amen praise the name of the lord and
[1:11:09] again it's not just coming in says oh i
[1:11:11] believe the message i believe this i
[1:11:12] believe that this doctrine that doctrine
[1:11:14] and all it is is a creed amen oh yeah
[1:11:18] as i said when i when i was at an altar
[1:11:20] in a message church
[1:11:22] and oh and there was a lot of people up
[1:11:24] around the altar
[1:11:25] and again there was this person sitting
[1:11:27] there not sitting but kneeling next to
[1:11:28] me
[1:11:29] and they just prayed said lord thank you
[1:11:31] for the word thank you for the message
[1:11:33] now lord she said we know we don't have
[1:11:34] to come under any man
[1:11:36] and i said lord i said they need a
[1:11:39] revelation
[1:11:40] amen amen because the power of god said
[1:11:43] he said when when you come under god god
[1:11:45] brings you under a flightful ministry
[1:11:47] amen and someone said oh brother branham
[1:11:50] is there a ministry in the bride
[1:11:52] and does it right have a ministry and he
[1:11:54] said sure the bride's got a ministry
[1:11:56] and he said it's been going on for 2000
[1:11:58] years
[1:11:59] and he quoted and and he said these have
[1:12:03] god set in the church
[1:12:04] and he said the faithful ministry amen
[1:12:08] so he says they are in the brain and yet
[1:12:10] there are so-called believers that don't
[1:12:12] believe
[1:12:12] in any ministry that's true amen
[1:12:15] there are so-called believers that don't
[1:12:17] think that they've got to be under any
[1:12:18] pastor
[1:12:19] any evangelist no no no they just feel
[1:12:21] they're they're set free
[1:12:23] but brother if they really had an
[1:12:25] experience with jesus
[1:12:26] they come under a ministry here
[1:12:30] amen as again that that brother said to
[1:12:32] brother branham he said brother branham
[1:12:34] he said i don't need any any preacher to
[1:12:36] tell me this and tell me that
[1:12:38] and so on he said why because i got the
[1:12:40] holy ghost and he's teaching me
[1:12:42] well the problem of god said brother if
[1:12:43] the holy ghost is teaching you he's
[1:12:45] using a man to do it
[1:12:46] that's right amen there's a man out
[1:12:48] there somewhere he said he in the body
[1:12:50] and he said he'll lead you to that man
[1:12:52] he'll bring that man all over you
[1:12:54] he said to teach you what he wants you
[1:12:55] to know amen
[1:12:57] so brother amen are we subject to the
[1:12:59] ministry these as god set
[1:13:01] in the church amen what for
[1:13:04] to strengthen the church to encourage
[1:13:06] the church to give the church the wisdom
[1:13:08] they need
[1:13:08] and the leadership they need by the
[1:13:10] grace of almighty god
[1:13:12] amen and the ministry of a pastor sure
[1:13:17] again another person said to brother
[1:13:19] branham oh i
[1:13:20] i'm an evangelist he said i i don't have
[1:13:23] to come under a pastor
[1:13:24] and the prophet of god went back into
[1:13:25] the word he said brother hear the word
[1:13:28] amen he said even the evangelist got to
[1:13:30] come on to a pastor
[1:13:32] amen by the grace of almighty god and
[1:13:34] all the others said to come under the
[1:13:36] leadership of a pastor that's right
[1:13:37] oh god help us i pray by grace amen
[1:13:42] that again oh well i got a pastoral
[1:13:44] ministry praise the lord but yet
[1:13:46] maybe the lord has got another pastoral
[1:13:48] ministry amen
[1:13:50] we'll see what god's going to do amen
[1:13:53] do god be oh lord god help us to be
[1:13:56] spiritual
[1:13:57] amen god happens to be spiritual and not
[1:14:00] just religious
[1:14:01] that's right amen there's too many
[1:14:03] believers that are just religious
[1:14:05] oh yeah i believe the message i believe
[1:14:07] this and it's just like a creed to them
[1:14:09] amen that's like the pentecostals
[1:14:12] brother and god's going
[1:14:13] they say well i believe god i believe
[1:14:14] this i believe that sure is what god did
[1:14:16] for them
[1:14:17] and what god has done for us but brother
[1:14:19] we still got to move on with god
[1:14:21] amen we still got to surrender to god
[1:14:23] and commander is
[1:14:24] the leadership of his ministries that he
[1:14:27] has set in the church
[1:14:28] by the grace of almighty god amen
[1:14:32] but brother we're getting to the place
[1:14:34] where there's more less there's less and
[1:14:36] less believers who are coming
[1:14:37] under ministries who are subject to
[1:14:39] ministries who are led by the ministry
[1:14:41] amen
[1:14:42] they're just going to do what they want
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:45] amen no no but they got to do what god
[1:14:48] wants them to do
[1:14:49] and you see the thing of it is when you
[1:14:52] start you got to continue
[1:14:54] amen and you've got to continue in the
[1:14:56] word
[1:14:58] amen jesus jesus highlighted that those
[1:15:01] those believers there amen that
[1:15:03] congregation there
[1:15:04] amen why should because they have
[1:15:06] continued with me three
[1:15:07] days amen they stayed with him
[1:15:10] and he said no they had no food would
[1:15:14] you stay with him
[1:15:16] oh he said no no no i'm not going back
[1:15:18] home no i gotta get some food
[1:15:20] no no there was something more
[1:15:23] controlling them
[1:15:25] amen they're putting more and more
[1:15:26] emphasis on
[1:15:28] the spiritual not the physical
[1:15:32] amen oh yeah i tell you this there's a
[1:15:34] lot of things that god would like us to
[1:15:35] do
[1:15:36] but we're believers god wants this god
[1:15:39] once said
[1:15:39] but no there's so many believers that
[1:15:41] still put more attention on the natural
[1:15:43] things of life
[1:15:44] not the spiritual that's right amen
[1:15:48] so god elvis brother you listen if we're
[1:15:50] sons and daughters of god
[1:15:51] we're putting emphasis on the spiritual
[1:15:52] whatever god wants whatever when god
[1:15:54] wants
[1:15:55] i'll do it here he is no brother amen
[1:15:58] we're not going to try to get god to do
[1:15:59] it
[1:15:59] our way we're not trying to get god to
[1:16:01] do it our time
[1:16:02] it's his time amen it's his time
[1:16:06] and it's his way amen and what he wants
[1:16:08] to do amen because there's many many of
[1:16:10] many a so-called
[1:16:11] believer oh they'll hesitate this
[1:16:13] they'll hesitate that they don't want to
[1:16:15] get involved in that oh well uh i don't
[1:16:17] think
[1:16:18] i don't think my family would like that
[1:16:20] so so that they think oh i'll just
[1:16:22] believe it go on
[1:16:23] believe it and live it amen believe it
[1:16:26] and walk in it believe it and reflect it
[1:16:28] amen by the grace of almighty god amen
[1:16:31] brave your spirit is right your answer
[1:16:33] is right yes
[1:16:34] the power of god said that that god's
[1:16:36] going to have even friends
[1:16:38] he said of the bride he said on the
[1:16:40] earth
[1:16:41] as they're there they're there to
[1:16:43] encourage the bride they're there to
[1:16:44] help the bride
[1:16:45] they're there to stand for the bride
[1:16:46] amen they don't see this they don't see
[1:16:48] that
[1:16:49] oh no not like the bright seas but it
[1:16:51] says they they have a right spirit right
[1:16:52] attitude toward them
[1:16:54] amen why because the bride got a right
[1:16:56] spirit and right attitude toward them
[1:16:58] amen brother just and again and say well
[1:17:01] if you're going to be hard and preaching
[1:17:03] preach to the bride amen preach heart
[1:17:07] amen lay it in lay it in lay it in by
[1:17:09] the grace of god
[1:17:10] amen but you don't have to be hard to
[1:17:12] those out there
[1:17:14] no no no no no whether it wants if they
[1:17:17] came to recognize it all and to
[1:17:18] surrender all
[1:17:19] and the yield to jesus they they don't
[1:17:22] care how hard it is
[1:17:23] lord you do what you got to do dude amen
[1:17:25] to get me ready
[1:17:27] you do what you've got to do amen so
[1:17:29] it's to take control of my life
[1:17:31] so lord amen whatever you got to do do

[1:17:34] so it's not me who lives it's you lord
[1:17:36] you're living in me
[1:17:38] praise the lord and again that's why
[1:17:40] sometimes
[1:17:42] a lot of believers they don't they don't
[1:17:43] like this ministry they don't like that
[1:17:44] ministry

[1:18:23] newfoundland
[1:18:24] oh he said okay and they asked him he
[1:18:26] said do you know

[1:18:36] humor at all
[1:18:38] he's just hard that's all and
[1:18:42] thank god for the witness that our
[1:18:43] brother lanny gave he said what
[1:18:46] you believe that yeah well he said it
[1:18:48] can't be the same journal loss that i
[1:18:49] know
[1:18:50] he said because he does have a sense of
[1:18:52] humor
[1:18:53] but that that believer went on and i
[1:18:55] don't know where they are today

[1:19:32] reflecting god amen
[1:19:34] and oh yeah sometimes there is a sense
[1:19:36] of humor and and the power of god said
[1:19:38] he said even jesus had a sense of humor
[1:19:40] yeah he said when he talked about
[1:19:42] pharaoh and when he talked about this
[1:19:43] one time with that and he said this and
[1:19:44] this and this
[1:19:45] he said maybe it didn't seem like a
[1:19:47] humor to us but he said humor to them

[1:21:00] amen now or the bible tells us is that
[1:21:03] true
[1:21:04] that that oh if you're just a child

[1:21:55] started but they didn't keep going
[1:21:58] amen and there's some all due respect to
[1:22:00] them that maybe god has to take off

[1:22:04] you're the seed of god
[1:22:05] you start and you keep on going you're
[1:22:07] you're still in the spirit
[1:22:08] sons daughters of god led by the spirit
[1:22:10] of god controlled by the spirit of god

[1:43:44] and pray
[1:43:45] lord give me your wisdom it's like i
[1:43:48] said too

[1:43:55] than me in management
[1:43:56] and he uh he wanted me to
[1:44:00] go tell that customer
[1:44:03] a certain thing but i knew it was a lie
[1:44:06] and i said i i said if you want to tell
[1:44:08] the law you tell it i said not me
[1:44:11] i said i'm not going to do it. so he he
[1:44:14] had to go tell it
[1:44:16] i didn't do it but they didn't mind
[1:44:18] until finally just one day i was stood
[1:44:19] there
[1:44:21] supervising some of the areas there and
[1:44:25] that manager came out and he said excuse
[1:44:26] me he said i got a question
[1:44:30] he said do you preach
[1:44:34] i said yes sometimes we have cottage
[1:44:37] meetings i said
[1:44:38] and i and i speak there sometimes but
[1:44:40] not all the time i said
[1:44:42] oh i i thought you you were more
[1:44:44] like that
[1:44:45] you were like a preacher the way you're
[1:44:47] acting and talking sometimes
[1:44:49] okay i said that's me okay that's fine
[1:44:52] it didn't bother didn't
[1:44:53] harm him no no but he just wanted to
[1:44:55] confirm it
[1:44:56] yeah and that was an american and
[1:45:00] today as far as i know he's back in the
[1:45:02] united states
[1:45:03] yeah so again what is your what
[1:45:05] reflection are you giving
[1:45:06] in your job what reflection have you
[1:45:08] given in your job you know regarding
[1:45:10] that you're a christian

[1:45:13] oh i'll trust you because
[1:45:15] you're you're a christian yeah god help
[1:45:17] us
[1:45:21] and for the glory of god
[1:45:25] but they i don't know why it had to be
[1:45:28] again had to be the glory of god that
[1:45:30] why would people
[1:45:32] when when i was just a young boy
[1:45:35] and even younger than our jonathan jr
[1:45:38] and uh younger than that and
[1:45:44] the friends that i that i used to get
[1:45:45] around with and go around with in my
[1:45:47] hometown
[1:45:48] they were there and they were always
[1:45:51] getting to swear yeah they would come
[1:45:55] over and they'll try to get me to swear
[1:45:58] i said that's funny why do you want me
[1:46:00] to do that for
[1:46:02] no i said i'm not going to swear to me
[1:46:05] i i just that it just wasn't my nature
[1:46:08] you know and so on i said no i said you
[1:46:11] can go do it yourself
[1:46:12] but i'm not going to do it yeah and they
[1:46:14] do that and they do that and they try to
[1:46:16] do this and
[1:46:17] then another issue took place and i was
[1:46:19] maybe
[1:46:20] 9 or 10 years old and
[1:46:24] my mother's brother died
[1:46:27] and i can see it now and my my mother
[1:46:30] did
[1:46:31] she sat down and she was oh my she was
[1:46:33] so she was grieving
[1:46:34] and she was next to the stove that we
[1:46:37] had back then this many years ago
[1:46:39] and i remember she had some bills in her
[1:46:42] hand
[1:46:43] two dollar bills and one dollar bills
[1:46:44] back then and i remember she was so
[1:46:47] she got to a place there she just lifted
[1:46:49] the side of that stove and threw it into
[1:46:51] the stove and it burned
[1:46:52] the money and that she was so overtaken
[1:46:56] and overwhelmed by the grief
[1:46:58] of the passing of her of her brother i
[1:47:00] remember visiting him before
[1:47:01] with with an older brother bidding him
[1:47:04] before he died
[1:47:05] but we were in that house there and
[1:47:09] our house there's it's not there now

[1:47:53] and it was something that if i could
[1:47:56] remember it now i don't
[1:47:57] uh what it was it was it was the verse

[1:48:01] of an old-fashioned hymn concerning
[1:48:04] death
[1:48:04] and resurrection oh he said wonderful

[1:49:23] i am
[1:49:24] also in bonds that i may make it
[1:49:27] manifest
[1:49:28] as i ought to speak amen

[1:49:55] over
[1:49:56] again to continue in the word
[1:50:00] to continue in the faith by the grace of
[1:50:03] god
[1:50:05] praise the lord there's a number of
[1:50:07] other scriptures here
[1:50:08] but
[1:50:12] i'll let i'll read the last two verses
[1:50:15] here last two scriptures
[1:50:17] in first timothy chapter four
[1:50:20] praise the lord
[1:50:27] first timothy chapter four
[1:50:34] we try to bring these thoughts to a
[1:50:35] conclusion but to leave you with this
[1:50:38] understanding
[1:50:39] if you start continue amen
[1:50:43] amen continue in the faith that you're
[1:50:46] going to grow
[1:50:46] more and more spiritual get more and
[1:50:49] more mature in the lord
[1:50:51] by the grace of god amen first timothy 4
[1:51:00] he said in verse 1 now the spirit
[1:51:02] speaketh expressly
[1:51:04] that in the latter times some shall
[1:51:06] depart from the faith
[1:51:08] giving heed to seducing spirits
[1:51:11] and doctrines of devils
[1:51:14] amen that's the truth so god allows us
[1:51:17] to stay with the holy spirit
[1:51:19] and the doctrine of jesus amen
[1:51:22] in verse 14 neglect not the gift that is
[1:51:26] in thee
[1:51:27] which was given thee by prophecy with
[1:51:29] the laying on of the hands of the
[1:51:31] presbytery
[1:51:33] meditate upon those things and give
[1:51:36] thyself holy to them and thy profiting
[1:51:40] that thy profiting may appear to all
[1:51:42] amen
[1:51:44] you're going to be a wonderful witness
[1:51:46] take heed unto thyself
[1:51:48] and unto the doctrine continue in them
[1:51:51] amen you've got to continue in it
[1:51:54] not just saying oh i believe it i
[1:51:56] believe it and that's it you go on
[1:51:58] no no continuing it worshiping praising
[1:52:01] god
[1:52:02] amen take heed unto thyself
[1:52:05] and unto the doctrine continue
[1:52:08] in them for in doing this thou shalt
[1:52:11] both save thyself
[1:52:14] and them that hear thee amen see the
[1:52:17] importance of continuing
[1:52:19] in the word amen continuing to grow in
[1:52:23] the word
[1:52:24] continuing to mature in the word amen
[1:52:27] continuing to be a witness of the word
[1:52:30] and reflect the word
[1:52:31] praise the lord and i'll read one more
[1:52:34] scripture
[1:52:35] to continue in the goodness of god
[1:52:39] hebrews 13.
[1:52:44] and he said let brotherly love continue
[1:52:47] amen
[1:52:48] praise the lord and be not forgetful to
[1:52:51] entertain
[1:52:52] entertain strangers for thereby some
[1:52:55] have entertained
[1:52:56] angels unawares amen
[1:52:59] and remember them that are in bonds as
[1:53:02] bound with them
[1:53:03] and them which suffer adversity as being
[1:53:05] yourselves
[1:53:06] also in the body so brother let
[1:53:10] brotherly love
[1:53:11] continue you don't just start off with
[1:53:14] it
[1:53:14] no and let it become cold no no
[1:53:17] let brotherly love continue by the grace
[1:53:20] of almighty god
[1:53:24] amen
[1:53:26] just bear with me
[1:53:33] you don't have to turn to it i'll just
[1:53:35] read this
[1:53:39] amen
[1:53:44] thank god
[1:53:50] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:53:52] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:53:55] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:53:57] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:54:00] by his spirit that dwelleth in you this
[1:54:03] is tremendous
[1:54:06] it's tremendous therefore brethren we
[1:54:10] are
[1:54:10] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[1:54:12] the flesh for if you live after the
[1:54:15] flesh ye shall die
[1:54:17] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[1:54:19] the deeds of the body ye shall
[1:54:21] live amen by the grace of god
[1:54:25] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:54:27] god
[1:54:28] they are the sons of god amen
[1:54:31] and if you're not led by the spirit
[1:54:33] you're not his child
[1:54:35] but if you're born of god you'll be led
[1:54:38] by the spirit of god
[1:54:40] amen for ye have not received the spirit
[1:54:43] of bondage
[1:54:44] again to fear but ye have received the
[1:54:47] spirit of adoption
[1:54:49] whereby we cry abba father
[1:54:53] amen the spirit itself bearing witness
[1:54:56] with our spirit
[1:54:57] that we are the children of god
[1:55:01] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[1:55:04] and joint heirs with christ
[1:55:06] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:55:10] may be also for
[1:55:11] also glorified together
[1:55:15] brother thank god for the oneness that
[1:55:17] we have with jesus
[1:55:19] amen amen praise the lord
[1:55:26] and it says behold therefore the
[1:55:28] goodness and severity of god
[1:55:30] on them which fail severity
[1:55:34] but toward thee goodness
[1:55:37] if thou continue in his goodness
[1:55:40] otherwise thou
[1:55:41] also shalt be cut off
[1:55:44] amen god help us to stay
[1:55:47] with the goodness of jesus by the grace
[1:55:50] of god
[1:55:52] amen just one scripture if you want to
[1:55:55] turn with me to this one
[1:55:56] first john chapter 2.
[1:56:00] amen god bless us continue
[1:56:04] continue continuing the word not up and
[1:56:06] down in or out just stay with the word
[1:56:09] amen say with what god has done yes
[1:56:13] but let's stay with what god is doing
[1:56:15] and what god will do
[1:56:17] amen because those continuing the word
[1:56:20] are going to continue on to the faith
[1:56:23] of the rapture amen by the glory of god
[1:56:28] so in first john 2 and beginning to read
[1:56:31] at verse 20
[1:56:35] but ye have an unction from the holy one
[1:56:38] and you know
[1:56:39] all things i have not written unto you
[1:56:43] because ye know not the truth
[1:56:45] but because ye know it and that no lie
[1:56:48] is of the truth who is a liar but he
[1:56:51] that deny it that jesus is the christ
[1:56:54] is antichrist that denieth the father
[1:56:57] and the son and whosoever denied the son
[1:57:01] the same as not the father but he that
[1:57:04] acknowledgeth the son
[1:57:06] he said as the father also amen
[1:57:10] therefore he said let that therefore
[1:57:12] abide in you which you have heard from
[1:57:14] the beginning
[1:57:15] and if that which ye have heard from the
[1:57:17] beginning shall remain
[1:57:19] in you ye also shall continue
[1:57:22] in the son and in the father
[1:57:25] amen and this is the promise that he
[1:57:28] hath promised us
[1:57:29] even eternal life amen
[1:57:33] is continuing in the faith by the grace
[1:57:36] of god
