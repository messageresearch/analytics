thanking you for all that you've done for us we thank you for past present and future and mostly be thankful for that you're allowing us to see what is happening today and we give you praise for that father so Lord as we come coming to read your word we know anyone can just open up the Bible and read it but we trust him in you for inspiration of God that you would anoint the preacher you will anoint the hearers of God so that when we can leave the service oh God we can be drawn feel drawn more closer to you so we give you the honor this morning Father and we just give you the praise in the name of Jesus Christ Church says amen God bless you this morning amen thank you musicians getting position is a hand [Applause] we just thank God for expressing my Mercy allowing us to be here this morning appreciate but Chad giving us a call it just worked out perfectly that we could be here I was supposed to be in Zimbabwe today but it was postponed and I wasn't I was telling about Chad I wasn't offended because when they told me it was postponed and two days after he called me so I knew everything was just fine I I learned not to get excited yeah honestly I just wait you know just just wait on the Lord everything is perfect in this time amen so we thank for what I want to read a scripture we'll let you be seated and I'll just go let's go to Revelations chapter three I tell you let's go to Luke first no I'm sorry I got so much here that we want to try to put in a little pattern if the Lord will help us turn to the Book of Genesis we'll just read the scripture First Genesis chapter 37. and we'll go to verse 23. Genesis 37 verse 23. it says and it came to pass of 23 verse 23. Genesis 37 verse 23 and it came to pass when Joseph was come to his virgin that they script Joseph out of his coat his coach of Many Colors that was on him he took him cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of Islam like ishmaelites came from Gilead with their with their camels bearing spicery and bomb and myrrh going to carry it down to Egypt and Judah said to his brother what prophet is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood Come and Let Us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren was content then they're passed by medianites nurturements and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated praise the Lord this morning uh just want to take a thought on a bomb and Gilead and uh this just a thought here but it got some many things we're going to try to bring out here into service this morning and uh and I would like to say I want to thank you for your prayers that you prayed for us and I I promise you it was prayer that brought us through and uh I was going to try to just give up testimony about those things and trying to bring it into this service if the Lord would help us help us amen it's a lot went on and it's going to kind of scripture that I read has a lot to do also what happened to me and I didn't see it coming funny see it coming but it happened praise the Lord but we give God all of the glory if we give God all of the praise amen but before I get to where I want to get to just to give a little testimony I want to uh go to Second Kings chapter four second Kings chapter four if we're going to go to verse 38. you know I believe we love the Lord with all our hearts but when things come personal in your life you'll find out a lot about yourself when you have to go through something and uh could hurt pretty deep or whatever you find a lot about yourself and you'll find a lot about the people that are around you in the we talk about David the faithful Warriors that they've had you know they was faithful they fought with David and they fought with David they they was with them they we called it the faithful Gentile Warriors and how they we know what the prophet said they knew that David was one day was going to be King gonna be on the throne and they were safer to it but you know even in all of their faithfulness something happened to them personally to where they want Stone David y'all knew that right you remember when David him uh went off for him in the Warriors and so forth and they come back and their wives and their children was taken and David said it was just a bit great distress and then they was going to actually Stone David his own Warriors that was fighting for him standing with him now they don't suffer the loss they don't come personal now now they're looking at David we want to Stone you but look what David attitude was he knew it was pressure he knew it was the strength but David did the greatest thing he comforted himself in the Lord even though his Warriors want to Stone it see now they was one fighting for him and everything but now something personal been taken from them now they change if people can be the exact same way they love the church everybody happy and everything but in deep personal things start happening to them then you start watching them change I'm here to tell you friends even when the deep personal things happen things that go wrong you can't understand it always keep the right attitude towards the Lord Jesus Christ knowing that all things work together for the good it's easy to get into the Flesh and start pursuing things assuming things it's easy to do that but we'll just stay still sometimes and watch them see the salvation of the Lord because he don't make mistakes is that right so I'm I'm saying that for a reason because I bring all these in to the service this morning now I wanted to read here I'm referring to some things that I just been studying lately uh a good message to really listen to it's the power of decision and I'm and I'm bringing a lot of thoughts from that this morning and in First Kings chapter 4 verse 38 I'm just we're going to read it it said Elisha came that's a gilgal again to gilgal and there was dirt in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him he said unto his servant set on the great pot and seized pottage for the sons of the prophets and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found the wild Vine and gathered there for a while Gorge his lap full they came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not so they poured out for the man to eat and it came to pass and they was eating of the pottage that they cried out and said oh thou man of God there's death in the pot and they could not eat their uh but he said bring me milk if you cast it in the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot I really liked the scripture and I liked how the prophet responded to it he said that Elisha didn't change the pot he got the same pot but he just put meal in it he said that meal which comes from a meal offering it represents Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday today and forever but what I loved he said he didn't change the power he just put the meal in the pot so I look at the message of the owl the prophet of God didn't change the change the Bible he didn't change the Bible but he did put a meal offering in it to show Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and I like how he brought it in he said how could this man not knew that what was different with the wild gourds and the things and the other things that they put in the pot he said he put wild gourds in it and so forth he and Herb he said how this man could not tell the difference from a wild God and the Earth he just can't quite understand it he said well yeah that's the same thing today how people twist up the Bible twist up the message can we say Amen they doing the exact same thing but we believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so what the message comes not to change the Bible but the brain thinks I get to perspected what man had added to the Bible down through the years adding to the word of God tampering with the word of God this message came back and restored it and brought everything to a balance can you say amen and then I just really just I really just blessed my heart and then the same thing with Elijah when they uh you remember they danced and they tore up the Altar and so forth when Elijah time came Elijah didn't get a new altar he just restored the one that they tore up can we say praise the Lord and that's the same thing brother sister yeah the Bible had become a new book to us but it's not it wasn't a new book that been Rewritten and give it to us no it's the Revelation that I've been sitting there all along that has become live to us in this day and time that we're living in he's saying I said well brother birdy where you going I'm I'm building up to somewhere I promise you that and then uh I would write some things down from that message then the Prophet come down to when you begin to talk about Aaron's Rod you if you go stutter the message you just kind of go down the lines on these things because it's all going to come back to us even we love the Lord with all our hearts but I think I do know in the time we're living in God wants us to have a deeper consecrated life with him and then he began to refer to Aaron's rod and that really just blessed my heart he said just like Aaron rod he said living in the presence of the king under Shekinah glory of the Lord Jesus Aaron Rod but it he said put Aaron's rod in there and an old dead almond tree but as it went under the Shekinah Glory everything it was restored again he said put Aaron's rod in the holiest of holies I like what he said everything it was was restored again it was a dead Rod but everything it was was restored again and he said that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the Shekinah Glory of the Holy Spirit the veil drops behind him everything that he ought to have been a Son of God blooms out of him again that's that's beautiful can we say man because every predestinated sea ever if he designated son and daughter of God what we need is to get into the presence of God everything that we meant to be getting in his presence is going to come out amen you know uh I've seen down through the times just like even in the Book of Genesis you know when God said let there be let there be let every seed bring forth of its own kind what God was calling for in the Book of Genesis he wasn't calling for the tree to bring forth he was calling to deceive to bring forth amen because if he called to deceive to bring forth the tree will automatically come so that's what God has been doing to his bride he been calling to deceive he's been calling to Western our heart because he can get to West in our heart what we ought to be is going to automatically come out you see sometimes you get people when they try to deal with people they call into the person's flesh they're trying to convert flesh is that right no it got to start here starts in the heart then it automatically comes out on the outside can we say praise the Lord now it's so beautiful how the prophet put these things I'm just going to read he said I noticed long ago this comes from the power of decision he said there's some things that we have to do that God cannot do until we do it when I first married that I said okay and then he begins to explain it he said did you know that Ministry he said look we are the branches he is divine but Divine can't bear fruit the branch is what bears fruit amen he said it's the precious that bear fruit he said he furnishes the energy but we got to do the job you get what I mean the holy spirit is here tonight you see him each night he knows you but the only way he speaks is through us is that right our hands are his hands our eyes are his eyes he said now notice that he gives us things Jesus was standing one day looking upon the Harvest do you believe he was the lord of the Harvest he looked upon the heart he said you pray for the lord of the Harvest that he would send laborers into the Harvest because the Harvest is right and the laborers were few in other words you asked me to do what I know that's got to ought to be done that he could not do it until they asked him to do it so amen Jesus is the source he is divine we are the branches but if he wants fruit to be bad in this day for people can see it he wanted to be shown through you and me he want his life to be reflected through you and me can we say praise the Lord and then you know sometimes me and mother cat was even talking this morning it was kind of interesting when I went in your bathroom this morning brother I see some lotion I think it called uh stress relief I said Lord have mercy if that like they're going to worry I I I I I want to find where it was made I'll buy every bit of that they got and I use it every day I put it all over my body I do it this stress relief but I do no one to relieve the stress that's the Lord Jesus Christ but sometimes we can reflect back on our lives how we was raised and and when brother talking about me he was just talking about some things this morning he didn't know I had this quote that I was going to deal with you know there's nothing is uh surprised as God the way you was born how you was raised God knew all about it some people got so much deep complexes in their lives because they wasn't raised a certain way or why could I have been raised in this family why would we we didn't have this and why do I have to go through all of this and they they grow up with a little bit complexes in their life like that I'm for one I've been down that road but after God revealed himself to me them things don't matter because everything was for a purpose because God just know how to pull the war over the devil's eyes and I just like something here what the prophet said and it's beautiful he said now he said how he said how Faith confounded pharaoh he said how Pharaoh raised Joseph right up in the castle at him gave him the best made a good strong man out of him he lived 120 years he said and the devil raising up God's child raising up the child of God to do the work of God how God pulled the war over the eye that time because he's God so God could let the devil raise you so later on you do the work of God hello what you what you think Paul you remember Paul the devil raised Paul because Paul came to us place to just for him to be able to go to the high priest to get letters that show Paul had come to a position in life that they respected him he had Authority but they did not know they was Raising Paul for Paul to turn right back around and come back and get them so the devil let them raise Paul the devil God let the devil give Paul all of his education train Paul so Paul could come right back and use all of that because you remember Paul was smart he was extremely smart but he said I don't want your face to be resting on the wisdom of man but on the power of God Paul could have I didn't come with you and actually a speech which he could have he could have used it but he I promise you he did it depends on who he was talking to because Paul knew how to become all things to all men he knew how to talk to the rich the poor the intellectual he didn't even know how to come down on the level of those that wasn't that smart God trained him that way so all through his life God was this let the devil raise him but to do the work of God the same thing what Pharaoh did he raised Moses right in his house for Moses to come right back around and tear down this house praise the Lord you know why I believe why God did that to be honest with you I believe he did that because Adam Ray came Adam raised the devil hello God said all right you raise the devil and he caused problems in the family he said now I'm gonna let the devil raise some of my children so my children to call problems in the devil's family so that's why my past with the life that I live I learned from that God let me go through that so I can use it now to tear down Satan's kingdom [Music] praise the Lord so it just does the way to all my complexes and I thank God you have painful things happen in life but I'm able to use those things now to identify certain things and people like and let them know keep pressing on godhead is upon you don't stop praise the Lord amen I like that raised let the devil raise God's child to do the work of God amen and uh I'm getting to my messages hold on a little bit he says in the younger generation I just read something earlier and they questions through ministers action questions about younger generation what can we do and what they're going through and so forth and you know I thought about that younger generation I used to be young too what was done for me I met God myself it's no new trick today [Applause] to try to help young people it ain't no new anointing no new tricks to help the Young Generation the word of God is still the same they need to meet God just to sing their way we did it ain't no special Ministry there's only one Ministry it's this message of our they have to come to it just the way that we did because if you're not careful trying to figure out what to do with the young people what you're going to actually do make a program for young people and that ain't gonna work because that program will turn into a denomination man we need to get them to the Lord Jesus Christ preach the word let them sit upon the word at their appointed time in their life when God's going to touch them God will he's done the same thing for you and me there was no program for me when I met the Lord God it was God's program he came to me and that's what they have to do the same thing today I will admit there are greater challenges for the young people today but that just makes it more glorious can we say man the things that they have to face today it just makes it more glorious that they're Overcomers in this day because in every age the prophecy is him that overcome it so God's Gonna help Overcomers in this age in this time and we're going to do it by the blood of the Lamb so it ain't no special program but what it is all these things that be presented there and he was talking about here he says in the power of decision the prophet says this he said I've been teaching before Moses he said before it came when God was going to frame the righteous seed through Cain he said you came but I know he meant through eight now he said you came right here but you know sometimes people made a mistake he made a mistake no he didn't make a mistake I know exactly what he meant praise the Lord he says see how the devil worked to cut it off in the days of Moses he drowned all the children in order to catch the elect one of God coming forth he said in the days of Christ he had all the children killed from two years old back trying to stop it that's one of the devil's tricks today know that he said it's to break faith from The Young Generation faith in what the word that's what it is it's so many distractions my my uh what I like to encourage young people to do believe this message believe this word whether you understand it or not believe it tell God you believe it and then you just keep having your faith in the word something to happen down in your life but if the devil can get you to doubt the word ain't nothing going to happen in your life but always just believe in the word like the prophet said if you don't understand it you're still capitalize it with an amen praise the Lord God bless you I just wanted to get that one all lit off my chest now I want to tell you how this happens to what happened to me I can look back now and see it come and see how it happened but at the beginning I didn't and I want to thank you for all your prayers all your support I really humbled myself I didn't realize how many people knew me I got messages from people I didn't have a clue they were from different countries just flowing in and that really just humbled me and I I really it really did I said Lord thank you but I will say this and what I went through not all of it was good but what I am thankful for I wasn't depressed I was irritated I really was I wasn't gonna let depression get me but I was real irritated and aggravated and and I told my church when you the worst thing you can do to somebody it's when they're going through something start going oh brother that's not good I told my church do not do that to me brother prayer nope don't do that to me I said just pray for me I said you remember they tried to do that with Paul when he's trying to stop him from going he's Paul said no no I'm going to pause it no they said oh Paul don't go Nook he said you you sat and you're breaking my heart I'm not only willing to go to Rome I'm willing to go die trying to mess with emotions that's the church don't do that the same thing with a child you get a little child if they fall they might not even be hurt but if you go Oh They'll stop they'll look at you and go huh but if they fall you say get up camp get up there just yeah so I said don't don't do me like that because I am not depressed yes I'm irritated but I'm not depressed just pray for me so I want to tell you I want to show you which I'm going to use the scriptures because it's part of what happened how'd this happen actually it was it was July the 30th now the accident happened August 3rd but July 30th because I went back and it was a Saturday night I was at uh Mike walls Church and I read a quote in the church a book that stirred my heart up and I'm going to read it in a minute and it has to do with eyes and and so forth and uh and I preached at his church I was excited that Sunday and I preached then I came home I got home that Monday I went to work just excited just excited and then Wednesday came which would have been August the 3rd can't wait to go to church if you're a minister here you'll understand sometimes you just get a sermon you just can't wait to preach and that was a Wednesday I was uh at work can't wait to get preach this sermon you know working going fast and they were telling me the granite man got to come and I need to put some quarter around down I swear I need to put this down before they come so I ain't got to crawl up under there and I just start shooting quarter around but it was it was Walnut crawled around hard and I was shooting it come on in a couple Nails ricocheted I said maybe I need to press the gun that hard I need to get this job done and I kept on shooting and I was down on my knee and then I said when I shot so literally like somebody just drew their hand back as far as they could get it and punch me in the face and I failed it where I was already on my knees and I was holding my face what was that then the guy that was working with me he said uh you all right so I'm fine I'm fine he said uh all right all right that's it okay and then I got up and when I stood up I opened my eye something still in there he said what come come come come there's something still in there man he said take it out he's all right so I opened my eye he said oh no I ain't taking that out he said you need to call 9-1-1 I

the phone down then I called 9-1-1 and I sat down you talking about shock I was just literally in shock I guess the shock was so bad to you couldn't really feel the pain I was just like whoa they was on their way and then I called my wife she said hey foreign I mean like I meant to do it I didn't mean to do it come on man I really I didn't mean to do it where you going what hospital are you going I don't know I said they're on their way and then it took them five minutes they got there this is what's the problem I said you're pretty tougher it's oh wow somebody got a cup and put a cup over my eye and wrapped it up so I wouldn't hit it and he said what hospital you want to go to you know it's paramedic today it was kind of funny they know the good hospitals and they know the bad ones my county that I live in is Anderson but it's a terrible Hospital but what happened the accident happened in the Greenville County they said which which hospital you want to go to that's which one you recommend they said definitely Greenville definitely definitely green you don't want to go to Amish excited I said can you I said can you uh call my wife and tell her which way to go which one I'm here to give me your phone you know face ID with that thing on the Facebook gonna work so I said pastor my code he's okay he said oh me sweetie that's her so he called and told her to come to Greenville now when all this going on you can't really process it at the time until you calm down so what was driving to the hospital uh they called it in and then they asked the people in the hospital to ask them is this is this traumatic is it trauma is it a bad and they say yeah and then when they got off the phone I heard them talking to he said they're gonna ask me he said I told him this trauma it's I told him right didn't he said this is trauma I'm he said yeah because he wanted to make sure they shoot you straight in because if they didn't say trauma they're going to put me in the emergency waiting room and I could have been there four hours with a nail stuck in mine because I think I made the right call I said to myself yeah you made the right come on and uh but then when we get there you know they roll you in now things come to reality now and I'm laying on that I'm laying there I'm saying this is messed up this is really messed up but I thought I said prayer I said prayer so I called I tried to call my pastor tell him what happened I said just pray Just prayed and then I had just preached for Mike walls I told him I said brother Mike pray and he happened to be at a meeting down in North Carolina at Joe Greene and he prayed for brother Burley so in that prayer immediately started going and then I was laying there the doctor finally come in the eye doctor and he said let me see I'm Tate didn't he looked in there he said oh see when you hear stuff like that they're going to pull your face down and I'm like he said definitely surgery he said yeah I just come from upstairs I just removed the eye why do you want to say that he literally just came out of surgery took somebody out now why you want to tell me that this is messed up after surgery I was okay we're gonna put you to sleep okay okay and then he said uh all right I said I said can I ask you a question he said yeah how long is this going to take he said why you got somewhere to go I said actually I do he said well I said I gotta preach tonight he said I don't think you'll be preaching tonight he said but you can preach to us that was a mistake on his part so I'm laying here doctor there Nurse there they said you can preach to us I said okay I'm just showing how all of this worked up now I said Doctor whistle no the paramedics told him what I said because when the paramedics picked me up on the way to the hospital I told him I was preaching tonight on eyes they said really I said now this happens to me he said wow so they told the doctor that so when the doctor came he said well I did hear you was going to preach your eyes tonight I said I sure was he said well you can preach to us I said okay I will so now I read this quote I'm gonna read it to you are we all right just come from the lay of the sea in church day these things you might know but this is where my inspiration comes from but barely said the name Leah The Seer which means people right well very common and it was given to several cities and earned a royal ladies so named he said this city was one of the most politically important and financially flourishing cities in Asia Minor enormous amount of property was bequitted to them to the City by prominent citizens then he said it was the seat of a great medical school people was distinguished in the Arts and Science for some reason this this quote great medical school I remembered that quote so when I was in Virginia I looked this I said great Medical School great medical school so I decided to do some history research on laodicea like I said some of you might know this I wonder what was the medical school was so as I began to research I found now I'm telling the doctor this he said do you know where in Atlanta to see an age he said he said that's funny we are studying on the Book of Revelation I said no I said I said now you might read Ephesus and Smyrna and just call them churches I said but they're Church ages sir I said when we're in the lay of the sin age he said okay okay okay I said but now in in this scripture I said the Bible tells us in Revelation chapter 3 he said I canceled D to buy me gold try to find that those men be rich and write Raymond that means be clothed and the same in our nakedness does not appear and the eyes were I found that thou May is see what's so funny I got to read the scripture now but when I was laying on that the the doctor's bed I quoted it verbatim that's how I known it I was and I just quoted it that's the doctor that you notice he said I sound he said yeah I said you're eye doctor he said yeah I said this is what I was going to preach on I said but the age we're living in is called a layer of the sin age I said now the doctor I said God speaks it's just anointing just came I said Doctor God speaks to us he take things we can relate to so he can speak to us he said okay I said for instance sir you're a doctor I said now God could use Dr terms to catch your attention something you could relate to he said right I said no let me give you some examples sir I said let's use Peter for an example I said did you know Peter was an expert fisherman he said okay I said Jesus use fishing to get Peter's attention he said okay I said you remember sir I said Peter knew in the Book of Luke Peter knew was out fishing I said they caught nothing they toilet all night they caught nothing I said but then Jesus when he finished ministering I said Jesus told Peter and him cast your net to the right I said Peter said but we called all night and caught nothing I said think about this doctor I said Jesus knew what he was doing he knew Peter was an expert fisherman so he used that to catch Peter's attention I said now Peter being an expert said now I know the fish is not bad we ain't caught nothing ain't nothing there can't be I said but he didn't realize he was talking to the expert Jesus Christ I said what did Jesus say cast that net to the right and then Peter said we told him so forth but nevertheless according to Thy word I said now doctor you remember they come up with a big drought he said okay that's right I said but look what he did he used Peter's job to minister to him I said all right I said let me give you some more examples I said the same thing with Jonah I said Jonah in the days of Jonah I said he sent Jonah to some people to witness to him I said they worship a whale they worship a fish God I said what more actually God could do and let Jonah go into the mouth of a fish and then that's the god that they worship and now here comes Jonah the fish their God spitting him out right in front of them as they're going to make them we're going to listen to this man Our God as soon as a God so we need to listen to this man I said that's how God speaks he uses things we can relate to he said okay I said now just like Jeremiah he told him go down to the Potters he's doing the work on the wheel what he doing showing him something natural to relate to to apply to something spiritual he said that's good that's right I just kept on going just laying it all out and I said now here's the thing doctor I said lay of the seal God used the I said to get their attention because what I found out when he God told him and to anoint their eyes with Isaiah and when brother Bella talk about that was a great medical there was high medical things actually that was their expertise in laodicea they actually had Isaiah where people would come from all around the world and they said it was something about them that I sell to you it was like a miracle would open people's eyes and that's what people came to let her they see her for he said really I said yes sir I said but God used that to them to tell them their eye problem you got your eye self can't fix it but the I said I want to kick you if we'll fix it and the doctor like whoa that's what you see he let them know I said this age doctor that's all your education all your learning all those things ain't gonna get you closer to God I said that God got some eye sound God got some bomb God got some word that he can give I said that'll be the only thing going to open your eyes and he said whoa I said now I said now doctor from what's Happening what I'm seeing as I believe God allowed this to happen to me to preach to you he said I believe you are right can we say praise the Lord this might seem a little Elementary to you but it means a lot to me how God speaks God can deal with you on something that you relate to to get your attention if anybody hears a carpenter or a building you know what I'm talking about God will deal with you you know if you true the church you to the trade you build something crooked God's going to speak to you you're gonna be like I can just straighten it out as I go that's what I do you know it's gonna be painful until you finish the job you have to cut everything crooked to make it seem like it's right but when it comes to the end of the day it's crooked so God will deal with you and say no tear it down Square it up now everything will go smooth that's Construction if you start off wrong you're going to end up wrong but boy I know you know what I'm talking about if it's out of square guess what you're going to build it out of the square now it might look good she's like oops still look good but somebody that's in the trade sooner they look they say that's out of square yeah you know it but don't nobody else know it if that's not right you just turn around you fix it and you make it right see God speaks through things like that that's crooked it's leaning no standing it up praise the Lord I'll tell you I don't see a lot of carpentry work and I know they didn't do it right they tried to it's painful trying to make something wrong try to make it go right when you need to go fix it make it right so it'll go right are you with me let me just keep going on here so I began to preach to this man and then God began to deal with me I sat back you're talking about painful that was very that was painful it was irritating but I did know it was a reason and it was a purpose and and then studying a subscriptor that you were very well familiar with God began to deal with me in Psalms 23 it says that I prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou known as my head with oil and my cup runeth over I always wondered when David said thou anointed my head with oil so when all this I'm going through I just begin to study and look this up and I found out that Shepherds David is speaking Shepherd terms that they literally would put oil in the sheep head and then I said interesting then they begin to explain why you know sheeps they can get a parasite you know they can get it anywhere in their body but mostly a lot of time they'll get it in their head they said that's why sometimes if you see a sheep and he'd be beating his head on a fence or scrubbing it hitting it on the fence what don't happen some parasites don't got up in there and it's driving them crazy but if his head was anointed them things couldn't have got there it couldn't mess with his mind it couldn't make him beat his head up myself that's interesting now anoint my head with oil because when we are not anointed friends you remember the greatest battles fault is in the mind so when you're not ignoring it and when I started this when I started seeing people now beating the head on a lot of things and complaining about this I don't know what's going on I don't know what's happening what's going on I said they ain't got no anointing on their head a nut in my head with oil that's why we have to stay anointed that's God to anoint us so we can think right can we say amen and there's another thing the prophet said he said when they were coming out when that was coming out of Egypt he was talking about the Revival and the thing that they was having he said they come across the Red Sea and when they got across the Red Sea and he said they were caught up in the spirit he said but when all that excitement went down then they started taking thought then they start complaining what are we going to eat what are we going to do because as long as they was in the spirit watching The Miracles of God what God done the Pharaoh they didn't think about things like that that's the same thing we need to do brother sister get get come in the spirit of what God is doing in this day all them fat we ain't gonna have time to think about all the other things that's going on around the message could we say man because in this generation in the town we're living in it was a season people want to puncture everybody around the message that's falling this one failed this one failed this one's failed I think that's wrong we need to point to the one that's standing we can build testimony yeah they might fall it but look who is standing in this day because God got a bride that's going to stand in this day it ain't about our who fall it's who's standing and we're standing by the grace of God not by our own marriage can we say praise the Lord I'm just getting started amen but I'm in Gilead let me just go down here when brother Baylor talks about the bomb in Gilead because what I was going through you you you think of medical stuff because I'm going through it but what y'all probably I think for the chat knew it was more than just my eye that I was going through from December of last year I was going through a series with my mouth but this been going on for four years I had got a bad gum disease it was and it was just send toxins in my body you weak all kind of stuff people kept telling me you need to get it fixed I said I know I need to get it fixed just it's gonna happen so I went through a bunch of frustration with oral surgeons and dentists and it just it was just getting frustrated so I just want to say just forget all of it but either way it just worked out so all of this was going on and then I got all of this straight now not the surgery but when I was getting ready to have the surgery that's when this happened from my mouth so now I got two things going on and you're talking about frustration I was frustrated to the Mac people would always call me and I appreciated it but my response was always I'm frustrated but not depressed because if I knew if I got depressed that's just gonna really break me up more worse than what it was so I was just trusting in the Lord so what was going on I had everything set up to get my mouth taken care of anybody who got implants that's some terrible stuff I got eight of them that's that's the things they can do to your mouth I don't even know it was just tears pain a lot went with it but I I never blamed God I kept my faith that everything is going to work out just fine now I want to read something to you I got a lot when brother Banner talking about the bomb in Gilead I realized he he called it the Holy Ghost he'll call it the word he referred to it in different things of what the bomb and Gilead is and what he says here and go away Jesus he said there's more to Ministry than Divine Healing he said the sickest body I know of tonight is the so-called Body of Christ it needs spiritual healing now I heard this quote preaching different ways I know some say the Bride of Jesus Christ is not sick because the word has came that is true that is 100 true it still don't take away from the quote but still unfortunately there are some still amongst the body of Christ is sick and because their faith is not where it needs to be so we can't take away what the prophet said this is what he said I believe the healing of the Bride of Jesus Christ is the opening of the word that he give us but as an individual you have to take that word yourself because in church we're on different levels that one thing you could never do and some try to present that we're all on the same level when we're not can we say man I can preach to you the pride The Pride The Pride The Pride the bride the bride if you ain't careful unless it's true but sometimes you got people no they ain't nowhere near they need to be and then living in a sinful condition they say well I'm bride but I'm yet I'm a sinner no they have to come to a reality where they at first I need Jesus Christ I believe you're predestinated to be the bride but right now I ain't living the life I ain't I ain't where I need to be but I'm gonna get there so you have to be careful about those things can you say praise the Lord so I believe exactly what the prophet said because our healing it is in the word about us receiving the word that makes us no longer sick praise the Lord he said there is only one bomb that I know that will heal and that's the word and that's the sick body that we want to stand up in the strength in the vitamin in the power of the Gospel that's why I use much of my time now I'm trying to strengthen the church so he's saying yeah it's sick but here's the healing here's what the strength comes from it's in the word and then I read to you earlier where he want to get the uh mess with the faith in this generation of the young people to lose faith in what the word because Satan know if I can get them to lose faith in the word I got him can we say praise the Lord so when he began to talk about the bomb it's also the word I begin to look into the scripture just follow with me I said everything that we have need of is in the word of God and Genesis 37 what we read earlier uh let me just read it again we look in Joseph's life and we know Joseph life type Jesus Christ we know he's dead but what's interesting to me how God pre-planned things way ahead in the believer's life knowing they're going to go through hard times but God is just pre-planaged in in Joseph's life I don't want to read all of it I want to go down here to back to Genesis 37 let's go to verse 23 again it said it came to pass when Joseph was coming to his Brethren they spilled Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him which we know that types the Lord Jesus Christ and they took him and they cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it now I want to skip this go to verse 25. they sat down to eat bread they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of Israelites came from Gilead with camels bearing spicery and bomb and myrrh going to carry it down to Egypt when I read the scripture so much has popped out to me we see what they was doing to Joseph Joseph was in a bad situation semen but God was behind every bit of this even Joseph didn't understand what he was going through at that moment his brother rejected him just the same as the Jews rejected Christ if you notice what kind of spices they had when they came to pick Joseph up look what God did let's read it again it says here verse 25. now to eat bread they lifted their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from where Gilead that's called The Prophet preached a message there's a bomb in Gilead so I went back and looked up Gilead and Gilead is the place where the bomb comes from now look at the mind of God he didn't they sitting there eating wondering what they gonna do God had all that pre-planned let them sit down and eat now you got these ishmaelites coming with bomb with spices and they seeing them coming God time every bit of that perfectly so they can pick Joseph up cause Joseph remember Joseph him type in Christ and Christ is also the bomb of Gilead God was sending Joseph down there before they brother they didn't realize the thing that was going to save them they were sinning it before them before they got there it's all that person this is so perfect in the economy of God that yeah they had spices and bombs but Joseph actually was the true bomb that God used the Israelites to get him down there so that his Brethren the Jews later on Joseph will become their bomb they needed Joseph so things that you go through in life God you can't see it at the time but God don't preplaying everything and when you get down to the bottom of the road he'll take you back say this is why I did this and I'll tell you out of all that I went through that's what I look back to now I know I got done with let what happened to me happened literally it brought me closer to God that's what it does let me say praise the Lord he said the bomb is the word so when I look into the scriptures Psalms 107 it says then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble he saved them out of their distresses and that word distresses it means straightness straight stress distress they say he saved the mind of the distress when they call unto the Lord and verse 20 said it tells us how did he saved them he said he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from all their destruction everything that we need is in the message I don't care what you're going through what situation what problem if you go back to the word God got a word in this message it'll save you from all your distresses it's there praise the Lord and then in Matthew chapter 8 it said when Jesus was entering into Capernaum there came into him a centurion beseeching him saying Lord my servant lies at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him the ceterian answer he said Lord I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof and then he said speak the word only in my servant shall be healed he even realized where the bomb was at it was in the word he realized what healing was at and then Jesus responded back he said when Jesus said the scripture said when Jesus heard it he mobbed and said to them that followed barely I said to you I have not found such great faith no not in Israel a gentile had that kind of faith in Israel didn't have it he said just speak the word what he did he recognized what the authority was in the word that's why in this day and time the devil knows what the authority is at in this time that's why he attacked this message so hard because he know this is what defeats him amen that's why we have to stay true to it so the bomb is the word and there is a bomb in Gilead and then Matthews also says verse 16 Matthew chapter 8 verse 16 said when Eden was come hey brother to him meaning that was possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and he healed all the all that was sick he did it with his word so there is a bomb in Gilead and I call this message of the hour it is the bomb in gilk Gilead no I might say something and I'm not trying to say it to be official but the confidence I have in the Holy Ghost I believe even marriage life is the husband and a wife are both born again I believe that they just humble themselves God has straightened that marriage out and he'll do it with the word many try to try to make excuses for failures and marriage and failures and decent area some things don't really work with me because I know God has said a perfect word in this day and I believe it creates a perfect marriage now a perfect marriage that don't mean you don't have disagreements those things happen but I believe by both to be lying on the word of God in their life it keeps things bring things to Harmony and keep things the way they supposed to be because they're using the word in the marriage if it's hurt in the marriage the word can hurt heal it is there pain in the mind the word can heal it if people were just applied to themselves put it to themselves it'll come out right do you believe that tonight also believe because unfortunately many believed knowledge it's the new birth no it's not I've seen it too many times just meaning can break down Seven Seals trumpets and just I'm talking about 100 accurately just the way the prophet taught it but yet they themselves don't have an ounce of the Holy Ghost you can't come up like that I believe I'm just speaking I'm not speaking directly here I'm speaking worldwide here but what I've seen don't happen especially down in the area where I'm from because we deal with a lot of situations that's coming up now I'm talking about even in older Saints I'm just coming to find out some built a house wrong they ain't have the right foundation they really never was born again and wondering why I keep fighting why I keep doing this why I can't overcome and I said let's go backwards for a moment how did you come into this message where did you start what what take me back if people get offended well I was just I raised up in this nuggets let's go back okay when did God deal with you when did God touch you what kind of experience what did you have explained that to me and when you start asking people certain things they can get to a play while I was just been in church all my life and that's what the problem is you've been in church all your life but you never received the Holy Ghost let Christ come in church is not salvation can you say Amen it's not we come here with a similar ourselves together but being born again Christ Having the Holy Spirit all right that's salvation that's what keeps us let me just read this quote to you are we all right it might not be jump shouting screaming but I'm just delivering my heart if I could find it right quick praise the Lord but a better say that man has come from the mission power decision I'ma tell you why I'm quoting pretty much this whole message because that's what God woke me up he woke me up Friday night said read it and I just got to read and it started answering a lot of questions I had he said if a man once anchors his heart of calorie because all the devils in hell but never Shake him no more he's there notice he cannot he that cannot stand chastise me isn't it illegitimate child he claims God to be his father when he's not just talked about by everywhere in the doctrine not stable and don't know where you're going double-minded and a lot of times double tongues I don't know where you're standing or what you're talking about then a man that's born again of the spirit of God knows exactly where he's at nothing phases him because something inside of him has already witnessed somebody outside the crowd Yonder and by faith he sees him amen so when we are anchored when we were born again and I know this is so Elementary but I'm just so convinced of the day worldwide that's what the problem of a lot of things don't happen people have not really received a new birth because when you receive a new birth nothing can shake you Knuckles can move you nothing can break you and these are sermons that don't got around the message because we don't got so educated people don't want to hear no more they want to hear something they're going to stir up their flesh make them jump shout kick and stream but what happens when you come down what kind of life are you living when you come down from there that's what I want to see can we say praise the Lord and I'll tell you brothers and sisters that's what we were kind of at today well it's 12 o'clock this might seem a little chopped up but brother sister there is a bomb in Gilead this is my third time actually being out preaching since all this happened to me and uh I've been a little careful did they tell you I don't supposed to get super excited and shout and calm down and all that kind of stuff you know I respect that into a degree because I was disobedient one time and it backfired me because I got to be very very careful I know I don't want to get no more pain than what I need so I kind of have to be a little bit reserved but you have a little respect because I don't want to go through that stuff no more I really really don't but I tell you Berlin Williams had have grown closer to the Lord Jesus Christ I was on the phone I'm just giving testimonies that okay I was on the phone with a young man last week he's going to blow his brains out when you're dealing with suicidal people you you're battling you're fighting for it you're trying to get ask God to give you the right thing to say to them and put some Spirits back from them because you can't you can't take that lightly when people think like that it's a demon and remember quote it was a guy that came to the altar Brother Bear and say I can't remember the message he said wait a minute he said something different about you he said oh there it is you see he was thinking on committing suicide he said if you wouldn't have came today you would have did it he said you would have did it so I don't take those things lightly so when you're dealing with somebody like that you got to take the word and try to pull them pull their thinking the right way and this young guy some of the statements that he made it it's this was a bruise away from his childhood life he said he said I don't even know what parent love is I can't find a happy spot and my life is just hating brood and arrogacy I said listen friend I said your problem is you say you forgive but you won't forget and you won't let go I said you have to let these things go because these Spirits are real the devil like to use people's weaknesses and things that they went through in life and try to bound them with it but you got to punt them to the remedy Christ why do you think in the Bible God recorded an insane man the maniac a gallery the meanest man or why you think all these messages are there it's to deal with different Spirits people go through now some people be like they must oh my mind's stronger than that I ain't gonna think about committing no suicide it's just you can't treat people like that there are different incidents in people's lives you got to deal with every one of them as a very serious case because it is but his whole suicidal Act is based upon what happened to him in his childhood life but my job as a minister didn't even ask a believer you take them to the true parent Jesus Christ your natural Parish might fail you but I can take you to one that'll never fail you I could take you to one he can ease all that pain you might not uh forget but he can take that pain away which you went through there's a bomb in Gilead he could take all of that away and I tell you how to finish talking to that young man that was a battle I was so empty my mind was spaced out because you literally was fighting Spirits from that individual and to say that we as a body of Jesus Christ when you go into something in your own personal life it'd be discouraging but I want to say something to encourage God will take you through something personally and you overcome it somewhere there in your life you're going to run into somebody going through the exact same thing you're going through and God will use you to minister to that person that's not the body of Jesus Christ's work me and Chad was talking y'all might know the story and I'll say this to minister some ministers know I'm sure you're aware of it when you can't get a message sometimes and you pray you can even fast and you can't find a channel you can't find nothing it was you just pressing and pressing do you define yourself one day preaching a sermon probably even way out of your thought pattern what God literally done to that Minister because people come to that church somebody's in the church is going through something but he used that minister to go through something so he can get a message to them people to that person that not just for preachers that's even for you that's how God uses the body how many you remember that story brother Branham speaking in tongues he went and go preach he told Billy them go on get somebody else to preach sing some songs something he said he just couldn't do it but then he said he heard somebody talking at the door of his uh room he said what voice is dead it's sound French or something he's white boss is dead he said then he realized it was him speaking in tongues he said what happened I yielded myself see what it was he had so he know he supposed to preach and his burden was so strong he went and yielded himself to God and when he yielded himself to God he started speaking in tongues he said I realized that was me he said in all certain the birthstone energy comes he takes off run down the hall and stop Billy Paul and went to the service but when he gets to the service he hear a testimony of a lady that was coming to the service and they hit a bump the doctors didn't want to do nothing for him no more he said then Blood start gushing out of the woman they was given the testimony and all of a sudden the blood stopped the woman get up start moving around he said what time what's that happen when it happened this is a woman he didn't even know right when they told him the time that it happened he said that was the time I was speaking in tongue he said God was using me to intercede for her that's so I connected the body of Christ actually is I need you and you need me if you are a predestinated part of the Bride of Jesus Christ we all need each other that's how those things work praise the Lord sometimes it goes on even on a higher level sometimes you might have a wonderful marriage and something's just kind of start going crazy a little bit like oh honey all right I'm fine but something seems wrong and then a little frictions come up but you overcoming you'll find yourself somebody gonna come through the same thing a brother because Hey Brother something's going on between my wife oh I know really I know exactly what you need to do brother just I went through that and you went through that sometimes people think preachers don't go through stuff we said brother I've been through that that happened to me and this will be their Deliverance that's our so well connected we are together the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why elect don't persecute elect I need you you need me and I'll be honest with you brother and sister brother in the hood around the message the devil don't come between it but before we leave here in the Rapture all of that'll be restored it will have to be restored because this is a portion of the body of Jesus Christ we were just apportioning down here in South Carolina a portion over here but when we all come together we'll be as one but the little frictions God's breaking all these things down and he got ways of doing it and uh step into some things I was talking to your pastor earlier but this is part of my Ministry you got to remember gifts everything God called you for called me for it for one purpose it is the glorified Jesus Christ every fault every failure that we overcome is still is to glorified Jesus Christ I can glorify him in my faults I can give him the glory because he's the one that helped me with it and I'll be honest with you every one of us go through a life you'll have a fall in your life you got to kill and you might say brother Berta what do you mean by that who chose Saul the people did but why did they choose him they said we want a king to do what to fight our battles to go before us they chose someone to fight their battles to go before them they wanted a king I look at that scripture too you remember on the Saul's Administration he had gifted men following him and those gifted men was trying to kill David with Saul because why they was on a Saul's anointing right but you remember when Saul died the very men that was trying to kill David come to David and the Bible said they came together to make David King after Saul died right so under David's Administration they was able to the gifts that they had David put them in the right perspective for they to fight the battles of the Lord not to kill David so sometimes we can we can have a Saul in our life to fight all about it things that we choose Pride selfishness this is me I inherited this this couple of my parents this come from my family line sometimes people want to use excuses how they was born to try to reflect what they're doing now well you know my family you know the prophet said their strands and family my family got this kind of line just the way that we are and this is why I do what I do I'm here to tell you one thing that's missing in that statement when you were born again you break family experience so when you keep try to use those things this is why I do that it's a song you're trying to keep in your life that needs to be cut need to be killed praise the Lord and I'm putting we all got a song and he's got to die remember Temple Pride can help you they wanted a king to fight for them right so when you're being confronted about something you can raise up King Pride and fight for you King selfishness to fight for you living the songs you got to kill and put them up on a holy ghost Administration and kill all that stuff out of your life that the Holy Ghost kill those things out of your life it's all about character brothers and sisters not how much knowledge we got it's all about character praise the Lord that's why I loved it when I could see a sister in her place by the grace of God and a younger sister get out of her place that sister can go right to her talk to her sister can we talk minister to her say this is what I'm seeing that's the way it's supposed to be that's the way it's supposed to be instead of a man have to do it let me talk to you pull them aside that's like you're supposed to work in the body of Christ same thing with men see get a brother a brother brother in his place he could see uh something in the brother's life potential he said brother I need to talk to you about something the Lord put it on my heart that's how the Holy Spirit works it don't always have to come from the pulpit right the gift is Right amongst you where you can help each other they're there but the thing that has to happen we got to Die the more we die to ourselves the more God can use us for his glory for the help ones that even write a mix and amongst us my business is not to know what happens in this church I got enough of my own church to deal with I'm not trying to find out what's happening here no no no I stay right there in my church and we deal with what we need to deal with but this is what I do know the devil and talk out the devil that's in South Carolina is still the same devil up here in these areas too and he just want to divide conquer and Destroy that's the only thing he's interested in but we are the greatest people upon the face of this Earth why because God chose us for this age let me tell you everything God had predestinated for us to be he gonna get it and you can look in the mirror and look down on yourself all you want to you're looking in the wrong mirror God's gonna get it out of you and I'm telling you we're not going to leave this earth failures will lead this Earth over commerce but we learn from all of the things that we go through in life is just to prepare us for what he want us to be and I'll say this in close it Joseph I always go back to Joseph if there ever was a man could have paid people back that done him wrong was Joseph his brothers actually sitting in his hands because you just said kill him they would have did it but Joseph had went through so much God took him through so much to develop a character in him and he told his brothers don't be hurt don't be angry with yourself you didn't send me here they the one sold him but he said you didn't send me here God did God put me in this position for you to preserve your life but now he got power with character have y'all ever thought about it the woman that told the lion Joseph and Joseph come out of that dungeon if she was alive she had the bow to Joseph she's the one told the lie to get him down there but you know what I don't think Joseph would have done nothing to that woman because he realized you just used to get me where I need to be and so in all these things in life that we go through this apartment so many disappointment even in the ministry all these things God know how to shift you even a preacher sometimes a preacher might want to sit fit in a certain circle God could ruin that Circle to make him go independent to get him to himself so he can deal with the preacher he's just such a tender hand of God how he deal with each one of us differently but you have to catch it I see Lord will you shifted me or you put me in position you're the one doing it ain't me you are the one doing it and he do it through circumstances in people he knows how to do it because remember brothers and sisters out of everything that was happening in Joseph line God was not focused on Joseph's brothers he would focus on Joseph after he got Joseph or he wanted him then he turned his Focus to Joseph's brother and brought them to him can we say praise the Lord that's why all of my faults and my failures I can look back now and there are nothing but Stepping Stones that's what they are and I've been molded by the word of God and about the trials pressures in life God has really molded me but yet I'm still bold I still straight and I'm still confident and I'm a straight shooter but I got another character with it praise the Lord I won't compromise that's one thing I won't do I would not compromise this gospel I'll stay straight to it may God bless you can we get the Lord of hand trust us all as well as the heart talk with you I got so much I want to preach but it's just so much I just want to share that with you I'm not telling you at all was it fun and you know it was pretty bad a lot of things bad but ain't no need to get into all of that but I give God the glory for what he has done and I appreciate all your prayers all support I greatly appreciate it and and uh can nobody tell me God ain't good you can't do that I mean I can I can go all day long Supernatural things just lining up I'm just like wow wow but I appreciate I'm more indebted I'm I'm God I said God I just want to be more sold out I want to live for your bride I want to do whatever I can for your people because you blessed me you helped me make me more determined to consecrate myself less and be able to bring a word for his people we are some blessed people friends and God has a five-fold Ministry so I'm trying to destroy it but you never can destroy what God ordained God has a five four minutes he's going to preach this message so be encouraged can we say Amen musicians could come wherever Hard Times comes or whatever the devil brings just be encouraged and be like David I encourage myself in the Lord that's one of my favorite scriptures and and my wife would tell you when brother Burley is down my greatest place for me to be is in my study room I always just go right there sit right at my dish pop on the tape or look at my Bible but when I open my bible sometimes just read three words and I just come alive that's my comfort right there it is the word of God he's all I got that he's all I need Amen Let Us bow our hearts dear gracious father we thank you this morning thank you for your word Lord I feel just like the prophet sometimes to have the words to even express what you've done sometimes it's hard to find one thing we can express how thankful we are how much we praise you for what you've done and what you're doing and what you're going to do but we'll like the prophet saying praise you right now we believe you for the future we thank you for what you've done in the past but we thank you right now Lord you're the one that has sustained Our Lives you're the one that kept us you're the one that opening our eyes but there is a bomb in Gilead the word of God is eternal Man fight against it man trying to tamper with it men try to change it but they can't father because you have a predestinated people that the world will find its place in every individual life Lord we love you this morning
