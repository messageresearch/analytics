[23:13] name we ask it
[23:14] amen amen thank you musicians that'll be
[23:17] it this morning
[23:18] if you turn your scriptures to joshua
[23:20] chapter 14 this morning
[23:22] i'm in joshua chapter 14.
[23:29] i pray for my voice is still a little
[23:31] bit rough from wednesday night
[23:33] but trust in
[23:35] the lord's grace this morning amen
[23:37] and good to see each one here in service
[23:39] this morning brother mcnell good to have
[23:41] him back with us amen and the different
[23:42] ones
[23:44] and then trusting that it'll be a
[23:45] blessing just before we start i want to
[23:46] say thank you to brother matt for last
[23:48] service we had some technical issues and
[23:50] sometimes it could be frustrating for us
[23:52] on the user's end but imagine how much
[23:54] more frustrating it is when you've got
[23:55] to sit there and work through it while
[23:57] the minister's preaching and you want to
[23:59] be listening to the word and you're not
[24:00] able to do it amen i've been on i've
[24:02] been where he's been and you can walk
[24:04] away and things are exactly as you left
[24:06] them and yet somehow they're not working
[24:08] this morning or this evening so i just
[24:09] appreciate that brother matt and men
[24:11] appreciate the sacrifice and the time
[24:13] that you put into it not just in service
[24:14] but certainly outside of it as well and
[24:17] then joshua chapter 14
[24:19] and verse 6 says then the children of
[24:21] judah came unto joshua in gilgal and
[24:24] caleb the son of jefuna the canozite
[24:26] said unto him thou knowest the thing
[24:28] that the lord said unto moses the man of
[24:30] god concerning me and thee in kadesh
[24:33] barnea
[24:34] forty years old was i when moses the
[24:36] servant of the lord sent me from kadesh
[24:38] barnea to spy out the land and i brought
[24:41] him word again as it was in my heart
[24:43] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[24:45] with me made the heart of the people
[24:47] melt but i wholly followed the lord my
[24:50] god and moses swear on that day saying
[24:53] surely the land whereon thy feet have
[24:55] trodden shall be thine inheritance and
[24:58] thy children's forever because thou hast
[25:01] holy followed the lord my god amen may
[25:04] god bless bless the reading of his word
[25:05] you may be seated this morning amen
[25:08] we're coming down to the final stretch
[25:10] on the series on the overcomers and as
[25:12] far as i've been led this will be the
[25:13] last
[27:02] i want you to hear
[27:53] the land wherein to he went and his seed
[27:57] shall possess it
[27:58] so the difference in caleb and joshua is
[28:01] not who their mommy and daddy was it was
[28:03] not who their ministry was it was not on
[28:05] the signs and miracles they saw but the
[28:07] scripture says they had another spirit
[28:09] within them now the holy spirit wasn't
[28:11] given yet
[28:13] the holy spirit wasn't given but yet
[28:14] there was something inside of them that
[28:16] latched on to the word of god and said
[28:18] we are more than able to take the
[28:20] country amen if god is for us who can be
[28:22] against us there was something in them
[28:24] as i spoke of last service that was
[28:26] tuned in to hear the word of god and
[28:29] that it would light a fire inside of
[28:30] them and bring courage and faith to
[28:32] their bodies into their lips so that
[28:34] they would speak what the word said and
[28:36] move forward to make it manifest amen
[28:38] they were tuned to a frequency that
[28:40] nobody else was tuned to without the
[28:42] holy spirit and it goes to show the
[28:44] predestination of god in those men's
[28:46] lives that they could hear the word and
[28:48] move to put it into action when
[28:49] everybody else fell back
[28:51] and then hundreds of thousands of people
[28:53] maybe millions of people step back and
[28:55] only two went forward in the promise of
[28:58] the word
[28:59] amen
[29:00] brother braham says this he says
[29:02] speaking
[29:03] he says they are like the children of
[29:05] israel who came out of egypt and stopped
[29:07] short of the promised land now those
[29:09] children of israel left egypt about 2
[29:11] million strong they all journeyed
[29:14] together they all saw the same miracles
[29:16] of god they all partook of the same
[29:19] manna and water from the smitten rock
[29:21] they all followed the same cloud by day
[29:23] and the pillar of fire by night but only
[29:26] two reached the promised land
[29:29] only two were true or real believers
[29:34] that's serious
[29:35] that's serious only two he says out of a
[29:38] million two million strong were true
[29:40] believers
[29:41] he says that is correct because the
[29:44] world tells us that the rest died
[29:46] because of unbelief
[29:48] unbelief means they didn't believe
[29:50] that's why he says joshua and caleb were
[29:51] the only true believers is because they
[29:53] believe believers believe if you don't
[29:55] believe you're not a believer
[29:57] that is correct because the word tells
[29:59] us that the rest died because of
[30:00] unbelief and because of unbelief they
[30:02] could not enter in
[30:04] then since that is so and only two
[30:06] entered then the rest were not true
[30:08] believers
[30:09] what made the difference
[30:12] he says two stayed with the word and
[30:14] when the hearts of the ten spies failed
[30:17] at kiddish barnea joshua and caleb did
[30:19] not stagger for they believed the word
[30:21] and said we are more than able to take
[30:23] the land
[30:24] they knew they could why because god
[30:27] said i have given you the land that's
[30:30] the only basis they have was god had
[30:32] said i have given you the land
[30:34] after all those israelites saw of the
[30:36] power and goodness and deliverance of
[30:39] god they did not enter into rest which
[30:41] is a type of the holy ghost so you can
[30:44] see right now that very few will ever
[30:46] believe all the way
[30:48] to receiving the work the spirit of god
[30:52] the spirit be around it be affiliated be
[30:54] in the presence of it and yet never
[30:56] receive the spirit that's doing the very
[30:58] things that you're cert that you're
[31:00] enjoying in the in the presence in the
[31:01] services
[31:03] amen you can be around it but not have
[31:05] it and he says there's only two out of a
[31:06] million that went all the way into the
[31:08] promised land of that generation amen
[31:12] there was something inside those two men
[31:14] that identified with the word and no
[31:15] matter how fantastic no matter how
[31:17] illogical no matter how supernatural it
[31:19] seemed they were more than happy to step
[31:21] out and say we'll lead the charge we can
[31:24] take the land come with us and we'll get
[31:26] this done amen they were built to
[31:28] receive it and not only that they were
[31:29] built to live it out
[31:31] amen not just built to receive it we can
[31:33] sit here all day long and we can listen
[31:34] to the preaching of the word you can go
[31:36] home you can turn on the tapes you can
[31:38] open your bible and you can say i'm
[31:39] receiving i'm receiving i'm receiving
[31:41] but that what it comes in must come out
[31:43] at some point amen we cannot just sit
[31:45] here and receive receive receive
[31:46] anything that receives something that's
[31:48] going to have an effect on it it's going
[31:49] to grow it's going to expand or it's
[31:51] going to put it out in the end amen
[31:54] amen we're not built to just here we're
[31:55] not built to just listen we are built to
[31:58] express the word of god amen that's the
[32:00] thing that we're looking for we're in
[32:01] the time of the manifestation of the
[32:02] sons and daughters of god amen
[32:05] numbers 13 says
[32:07] and he's speaking now of the spies and
[32:09] what they did and where they went and it
[32:10] says and they ascended by the south and
[32:12] came into hebron where ahman and sheshai
[32:16] and talmide the children of anak were
[32:18] now hebron was built seven years before
[32:20] zone in egypt so the children of anak
[32:22] are giants and they are the giants in
[32:25] the land these are the big boys these
[32:27] are the bad boys these are the ones you
[32:29] don't mess with when they're coming down
[32:31] the road you walk to the other side and
[32:33] then you don't mess with the sons of
[32:34] anak amen they're the best of the best
[32:36] they're the biggest they're the fearsome
[32:38] group of warriors in canaan they're the
[32:40] family that nobody wants to touch
[32:42] nobody wants anything to do with the
[32:43] sons of anec
[32:45] it says now the spies they came into the
[32:47] brook of eshkol and cut down so the
[32:50] brook of eshkol is just by hebron
[32:52] and cut down from there a branch with
[32:54] one cluster of grapes and they bare it
[32:57] between two upon a staff and they
[32:59] brought of the pomegranates and of the
[33:01] figs and then so the ten spies are
[33:03] walking through hebron and they come to
[33:04] this brook and they see these amazing
[33:06] grapes there and this bunch of grapes
[33:08] this cluster of grapes is so big that
[33:10] they have to tie it by the vine onto a
[33:12] large stick and put it between two men
[33:15] now i've never seen a bunch of grapes
[33:17] that big
[33:18] there's something special about a bunch
[33:20] of grapes that's so big that it takes
[33:22] two men to carry you know we go and we
[33:24] take a bunch of grapes from costco or
[33:26] something and it's about this big okay i
[33:28] can carry 10 or 15 of those no problem
[33:30] these grapes are so big it takes two men
[33:32] to carry them amen and i don't think
[33:35] it's by by happenstance that they find
[33:37] them by a brook by a place of clear
[33:39] running water where the word is flowing
[33:41] amen where something is planted and the
[33:43] word is bringing it forth in a way that
[33:46] causes supernatural growth that this is
[33:48] the land of milk and honey that this is
[33:50] showing the promises of god it's by a
[33:52] brook
[33:53] but it's also in a place that is
[33:54] surrounded by great giants and i know
[33:56] i've said it before amen that the
[33:58] greatest promises of god are surrounded
[34:01] by what the greatest demons that satan
[34:03] has because he doesn't want you to get
[34:04] the victory and the greater the promise
[34:07] the greater the barrier that he's put in
[34:08] front of you amen so nothing's going to
[34:10] be easy you say i want something big
[34:12] from god get ready for the big battle
[34:14] and then get ready to be putting it up
[34:16] putting on the armor of god and getting
[34:17] into battle and this is not going to be
[34:19] the battle of a moment this is not going
[34:20] to be no now i lay me down to sleep and
[34:23] you wake up in the morning and you've
[34:24] got the victory amen but this is going
[34:26] to be a long
[34:27] torn out drawn-out affair because the
[34:30] greatest weapons that satan has are
[34:32] going to be put up against you to try
[34:33] and keep you from taking the land amen
[34:36] the biggest grapes are surrounded by the
[34:37] biggest men in this case amen
[34:41] but
[34:41] speaking of being by that brook and this
[34:43] is something brother brahm said it just
[34:45] caught my attention he says we are
[34:46] planted in christ jesus the
[34:48] inexhaustible fountain of life and we
[34:51] just drink
[34:52] and push
[34:53] and drink
[34:54] and let me continue and push and drink
[34:57] and push and drink and push and drink
[35:00] until what we are growing bigger than
[35:02] anything else that is around us amen
[35:04] where we show forth the fruits of the
[35:06] life that's come inside of us we show
[35:07] forth what's inside of us in the first
[35:09] place and it's bringing now the evidence
[35:11] of what we've been feeding on amen drink
[35:14] and push drink and push everything that
[35:16] we need when we're filled with the holy
[35:18] spirit every healing everything that we
[35:20] have need of in life's journey is given
[35:22] to us right then but just drink and push
[35:26] drink and push he says it's all your
[35:29] personal property
[35:31] just drink that's all look and live
[35:34] that's all can you imagine those grapes
[35:35] saying i'm by the water but i'm
[35:38] unsure if the the waters are going to
[35:40] continue so i'm going to hold back now
[35:42] and just keep just going to take the
[35:44] little bit i want for today
[35:47] in case that it's going to be gone later
[35:49] we don't want to use too much today and
[35:51] then he says this is the inexhaustible
[35:53] fountain of life drink and push drink
[35:56] and push pretend like this is the only
[35:58] day you've got to drink
[36:00] and drink and drink and drink amen don't
[36:02] look to tomorrow don't worry about
[36:04] tomorrow drink for today until
[36:05] something's pushing out of your life
[36:07] amen amen
[36:09] amen when we look at the things that
[36:10] we're facing we see these big giants
[36:12] around us know that whatever you're
[36:14] going through on the other side
[36:16] whatever's on the other side is well
[36:17] worth the battle amen every scar every
[36:19] pain every humbling every sacrifice
[36:22] every tear you shed every difficulty we
[36:25] go through the thing on the other side
[36:26] the reward is far better than the than
[36:29] the difficulties we go through amen as
[36:31] the song says it will be worth it all
[36:33] right when we see jesus life's trials
[36:35] will seem so small
[36:37] amen
[36:38] when we're looking to the word and we're
[36:40] fighting we're and we're trusting god
[36:42] and we're wondering where he's at just
[36:44] know he's there
[36:45] and then he's there
[36:46] but we've got to push him and we've got
[36:48] to take over what he has given to us
[36:50] each one amen
[36:52] caleb speaking now in joshua 14 again he
[36:54] says 40 years old was i when moses the
[36:57] servant of the lord sent me from kadesh
[36:59] barnea to spy out the land and i brought
[37:01] him word again
[37:03] as it was in my heart what was in
[37:05] caleb's heart
[37:06] what was in caleb's heart was the word
[37:08] of god amen and the word of god said
[37:10] this was a land flowing with milk and
[37:12] honey it did not say it was a land full
[37:14] of giants it did not say it was a land
[37:15] that was difficult to take it said it
[37:17] was a land flowing of milk and honey and
[37:19] i've given it to you so when he walks
[37:22] into the land his eyes he has rose
[37:24] tinted glasses but they're not rose
[37:26] tinted their word tinted and so when he
[37:28] goes in he's saying i'm looking for the
[37:30] proof that matches the promise and
[37:32] everything else i won't see so when he
[37:34] goes in what is he looking at he's
[37:36] saying i'm seeing a land flowing with
[37:38] milk and honey i'm seeing it full of
[37:40] fruits and i'm seeing exactly the
[37:42] promise of god and though he sees the
[37:44] giants he dismisses him because they do
[37:46] not line up with the word of god all
[37:48] he's talking about is how this lines up
[37:50] with the word of god and he puts
[37:52] everything else to the side the other
[37:54] people were going in with the eyes of
[37:55] flesh and saying this is going to be
[37:57] difficult because the word wasn't in
[37:59] their heart but if the words in our
[38:01] heart then we call everything that lines
[38:02] up with the word as evidence and
[38:04] everything else as if it does not exist
[38:06] amen we know it's there but we say it
[38:09] doesn't matter amen we do not have
[38:11] blinders on our eyes to the things that
[38:13] we're facing amen we're facing great
[38:15] trials we're facing great great demons
[38:17] in our lives we're facing great
[38:19] influences of satan it is not that they
[38:21] don't exist it is not that we say they
[38:23] aren't existing it is not that we're
[38:24] saying they're not big but we're looking
[38:26] to the word of god that says you are
[38:28] more than conquerors amen that i have
[38:30] given you the land and that's what we
[38:32] are keeping our eyes focused on and
[38:34] that's what our confession is is what he
[38:35] has put in our hearts which is the word
[38:37] of god quickened by the holy spirit
[38:40] amen
[38:42] luke 6 45 says a good man
[38:46] remember they said to jesus good master
[38:48] he says there's none good only god
[38:51] okay you've got to have god in you to be
[38:52] a good man
[38:54] and a good woman
[38:55] amen let's not leave the sisters out of
[38:57] it a good man out of the good treasure
[38:59] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[39:02] is good
[39:03] so let me put it this way a godly man
[39:05] out of the godly treasure of his heart
[39:07] bringeth forth that which is godly can i
[39:09] say it that way because if it's good
[39:10] it's of god which means it's godly amen
[39:14] but what an evil man out of the evil
[39:16] treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[39:18] that which is evil for of the abundance
[39:20] of the heart his mouth speaketh as well
[39:23] you can't you can say all day long on
[39:25] this or i'm that or i believe this or i
[39:27] believe that but if you want to know
[39:28] what's on the inside of you look at the
[39:30] words you're saying
[39:31] amen and if you look at the words you're
[39:33] speaking do they line up with the word
[39:35] do they reflect the word or let me make
[39:37] it easy are they the word amen if you
[39:40] speak the word now you can have
[39:41] confidence
[39:42] otherwise you have to run it through the
[39:44] filter of the word on a regular basis
[39:45] but if you can speak the word in the
[39:47] things that you're doing then you know
[39:48] that that's the holy spirit working
[39:50] inside of you because out of the inside
[39:52] of your heart if the word's in there
[39:53] that's what's going to come out
[39:54] every time
[39:56] continuing with caleb he says
[39:58] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[39:59] with me made the heart of the people
[40:01] melt but i wholly followed my god
[40:03] and god acknowledged that
[40:05] and moses swear on that day saying
[40:07] surely the land whereon thy feet have
[40:09] trodden shall be thine inheritance and
[40:11] thy children's forever because thou hast
[40:13] holy followed the lord my god. what did
[40:16] he do he kept the word in front of him
[40:17] at all times and he says that's what i'm
[40:19] going to confess is the word of god
[40:21] every time he didn't deviate to the to
[40:22] the right he didn't deviate to the left
[40:24] he said i'm sticking with the word of
[40:25] god and my evidence will be based on
[40:27] what the word of god says about what i'm
[40:29] seeing and what i'm going through amen
[40:31] he says but now the lord hath kept me
[40:33] alive as he said
[40:35] these 40 and five years so he's 85 years
[40:37] old now
[40:39] it's been 40 years since god gave him
[40:40] the promise it's been 40 years since he
[40:42] walked through hebron it's been 40 years
[40:44] since he cut down the biggest cluster of
[40:46] grapes the world has ever known
[40:48] he says even since the lord spake this
[40:50] word unto moses while the children of
[40:52] israel wandered in the wilderness and
[40:53] now lo i am this day four score and five
[40:56] years old
[40:57] yet i am as strong this day as i was in
[41:01] the day that moses sent me as my
[41:03] strength was then even so is my strength
[41:06] now
[41:07] for war
[41:09] both to go out and to come in now
[41:11] remember when we spoke about david they
[41:12] went in before the lord and then they
[41:14] came out and led the people he says i
[41:16] can still go in before god get his will
[41:18] and come out and lead the people to
[41:19] victory and nothing has changed since i
[41:21] was 40 until i'm 85.
[41:23] age doesn't matter here it's according
[41:25] to faith amen david was perhaps 15 years
[41:28] old when he defeated goliath and now
[41:30] we've got caleb at 85 years old
[41:32] defeating the giants that came before
[41:33] him amen age doesn't matter in this it's
[41:36] according to your faith amen that's
[41:38] what's giving him strength here now god
[41:40] has given him physical strength to do it
[41:41] he's still got to be able to wield a
[41:43] sword and hold up his shield in these
[41:44] different things but it is according to
[41:46] faith that caleb's standing here and
[41:48] saying i'm ready to go get my promise
[41:50] and nothing has left my body's as good
[41:52] as it was
[41:53] can you imagine from 40 to 85 years old
[41:55] and you're still as strong
[41:56] that's a man
[41:58] that's a man that has not aged amen now
[42:00] we look at those scriptures and these
[42:02] but i'm just little old me i'm not caleb
[42:04] i'm not david
[42:06] and some of us are
[42:09] some of us aren't
[42:11] amen
[42:12] sometimes we say i'm just a regular
[42:14] christian listen this is what a regular
[42:15] christian looks like
[42:17] amen it is by faith it is not by
[42:18] strength it is not might it's not by
[42:20] intellect it's not by education but it
[42:22] is by faith in the word of god that we
[42:24] overcome this is what a regular
[42:26] christian looks like
[42:27] amen
[42:28] and you say well i'm not someone they
[42:30] could write scripture about listen
[42:31] scripture has been written about us
[42:33] we can look in the word of god and we
[42:35] can see what it says about the end time
[42:36] believer
[42:37] so you're in there the question is will
[42:39] you believe what it says about you
[42:42] brother brown says this he says when you
[42:43] accept god's promise being your personal
[42:46] property then you'll lean on his bosom
[42:48] and you're nursing every day strength
[42:50] now he's talking about a baby here
[42:52] this is a baby in christ so you say well
[42:54] i'm just a baby in christ let's listen
[42:56] to what he says about a baby in christ
[42:58] when the cancer once eats you up where
[43:00] tb has withered you away where the
[43:01] affliction has caught you satan's been
[43:03] into your house and crippled you and
[43:05] left you that way from a fever or
[43:07] something but each day you're leaning on
[43:09] his everlasting arms with your head upon
[43:11] his bosom
[43:12] nursing from the word nursing from the
[43:14] word and notice not only that but the
[43:17] baby who's fretting and upset
[43:19] things are not good
[43:21] the baby's sick your mothers will know
[43:23] about this when the baby's sick while
[43:26] it's nursing
[43:27] way
[43:28] before it's well it's satisfied while
[43:32] it's nursing you mothers will know this
[43:34] anyone that's had a child will know when
[43:35] it nurses it settles down doesn't it as
[43:38] soon as it latches on to the mother it's
[43:40] where it's supposed to be and it's
[43:41] getting strength it's getting healing
[43:43] it's getting deliverance from whatever
[43:45] it is that's holding it back and it
[43:47] settles in because it's in the comfort
[43:49] and it's receiving the strength that it
[43:50] has need of
[43:51] he says and every believer every
[43:54] believer strong weak doesn't matter
[43:56] every believer every man that cometh to
[43:59] god must believe that he is and a
[44:01] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[44:03] him and every believer coming to god
[44:06] when he accepts god's provided weigh his
[44:09] sacrifice as he leans upon the bosom of
[44:12] god to trust for his healing salvation
[44:14] whatever it might be he's satisfied
[44:18] he don't jump about from pillar to post
[44:20] not tossed about by every wind of
[44:22] doctrine but he's satisfied god gave the
[44:25] promise i've accepted it that settles it
[44:29] so i'm satisfied just right here
[44:33] amen can we say amen to that i'm
[44:35] satisfied just right here that god said
[44:37] it i believe it and i'm trusting it to
[44:40] come to pass amen
[44:41] but let's walk away from the great
[44:43] heroes of the faith for a second
[44:45] let's go to the weaker heroes of the
[44:46] faith yet a hero still let's look at
[44:48] sarah in hebrews 11 11 it says through
[44:51] faith also sarah herself received
[44:54] strength to conceive seed and was
[44:57] delivered of a child when she was past
[44:59] age because she judged him faithful who
[45:01] had promised where is sarah's strength
[45:04] she has none she needs strength she has
[45:07] no strength but it says by faith like i
[45:09] said your faith is what determines the
[45:11] outcome not your strength not your skill
[45:13] not your gift it is your faith in the
[45:15] word of god amen and in your weakness in
[45:19] your body yet great faith can bring
[45:21] great results
[45:22] amen sarah by faith received strength
[45:25] she didn't even have strength she
[45:26] couldn't even have a child when she was
[45:28] young it's not just that she was barren
[45:30] it's that she lacked the strength to
[45:31] bring it to full term
[45:33] sarah's body was not built to have a
[45:35] child that's how deep this miracle is
[45:38] she wasn't built to have a child she
[45:39] didn't have it in her to have a child
[45:41] whatever it was her body wouldn't
[45:43] produce a child and so when she comes
[45:45] here and she needs a body change sarah
[45:48] needs a body change she doesn't just
[45:50] need strength to have a child at 90
[45:52] years old at the tender age of 90. amen
[45:55] but she needs a body change just to have
[45:58] this child and she receives it in her
[46:01] flesh so much so that when her husband
[46:03] forsakes the word of god and goes into
[46:05] another land the king looks at her as a
[46:08] 90 year old and says i want her for my
[46:10] wife over all the 21 year olds
[46:13] that's the kind of body change sarah got
[46:15] yeah by faith
[46:16] by faith by faith amen
[46:19] sarah made lots of mistakes on her path
[46:21] but yet by faith amen and god gave it to
[46:24] her in the end
[46:25] amen if that's our what's our excuse
[46:29] after that what's our excuse she
[46:30] couldn't have children starting to
[46:31] finish she needed a body change and yet
[46:33] she she had faith and she believed it
[46:34] and at 90 years old she got the promise
[46:37] amen what's our excuse
[46:39] brothers branham says and now from all
[46:42] the redemptive blessings that jesus died
[46:44] for
[46:44] is everyone your personal property you
[46:48] believers
[46:49] it's only for believers
[46:51] the only thing you have to do is just
[46:53] believe it
[46:54] accept it and call it yours
[46:59] like i said this is the selfish part
[47:01] mine mine mine mine
[47:04] mine
[47:05] mine mine mine mine yours too but mine
[47:10] mine mine mine
[47:12] it is mine this priceless treasure
[47:15] amen
[47:17] when a man is born again of the spirit
[47:19] of god god gives him a checkbook that'll
[47:21] last him through all through life's
[47:23] journey
[47:24] there's no limit on this one
[47:26] and at the bottom of each check has got
[47:28] jesus name signed to it and you just
[47:31] fill it out for any
[47:33] redemptive blessing
[47:36] it's yours
[47:37] all ready paid for
[47:41] he says now surely you're not afraid
[47:43] that it won't be cashed if you're afraid
[47:46] you just hold the book in your pocket
[47:48] now in those days it was a checkbook
[47:50] today we'd have a debit card a debit
[47:52] card attached to an account
[47:54] now if somebody gave me
[47:56] a debit card
[47:57] and said
[47:58] whatever you need
[48:00] you can put on this card
[48:02] what is it that will keep me from using
[48:04] it
[48:05] i guarantee you if i believe that person
[48:08] i'm going to use that card for
[48:09] everything
[48:11] everything that i face every need that i
[48:13] have
[48:14] if he says it's for my needs i'll use it
[48:16] for my needs and i know he'll never
[48:18] reject it then if i believe him i'll use
[48:20] that card every time but the only thing
[48:22] that would stop me from doing it is if i
[48:24] don't want to go through the
[48:25] embarrassment of having that card
[48:26] rejected
[48:27] that i'm in the store and i run up a
[48:29] thousand dollar costco bill and i go to
[48:32] tap it or swipe it
[48:33] and that gets rejected
[48:35] that's the only reason i do it is if i
[48:37] didn't believe that there was money
[48:38] waiting behind that account to satisfy
[48:40] the needs that i'm putting on it
[48:42] it's the only thing that would do it
[48:43] amen if i was more worried about my
[48:46] humiliation my embarrassment of having
[48:48] to say i'm sorry i can't pay for all of
[48:50] this now
[48:51] that's the only thing that would hold me
[48:52] back and that's what brother i'm saying
[48:53] the only thing keeping you back from
[48:55] claiming the redemptive blessings of god
[48:57] is because you're afraid and that's why
[48:59] you keep the book in your
[49:00] pocket amen take us back to the
[49:03] scripture first john 4 says there is no
[49:05] fear in love
[49:08] but perfect love casteth out fear
[49:10] because fear had torment he that feareth
[49:14] is not made perfect in love we love him
[49:17] because he first loved us
[49:19] amen if there is fear then god is not in
[49:21] operation amen
[49:23] brother joe shared this with me this
[49:25] week and it really struck me and
[49:26] he said and this is again brother
[49:28] branham he says and no matter what you
[49:29] say the days of miracles pass god don't
[49:32] do this and god don't do that you might
[49:33] as well just save your breath if that's
[49:35] what's in your mind if that's what's in
[49:37] your mouth don't even come to god what's
[49:38] the point you don't believe him he says
[49:41] i love him and i believe him and i take
[49:44] him at his word catch that love him
[49:46] believe him take him at his word now you
[49:49] can say i love him and i believe him but
[49:50] will you take him at his word that's
[49:52] really the question we ask so that
[49:54] settles it that's all god said so and if
[49:57] you can get to a place where you love
[49:59] him
[50:00] it'll cast out the fear that you have
[50:04] that he won't keep his word amen fear is
[50:08] never of god there is a godly fear and
[50:10] that is a respect amen that when you
[50:12] come into the presence of god that you
[50:14] bow your head that you are humble that
[50:16] you are submitted to the word amen we
[50:18] don't walk into the presence of god
[50:19] cocky and arrogant do we but we walk in
[50:23] because he has invited us to come in
[50:25] amen and there is a respect that comes
[50:27] there but we do not walk in fearful of
[50:29] our lives fearful of rejection fearful
[50:32] of what defeat
[50:33] amen if those are the things that are
[50:34] going through your mind then you need a
[50:36] greater revelation of god's love in your
[50:38] life amen why because defeat is not of
[50:41] god
[50:42] right
[50:42] depression is not of god right loss is
[50:45] not of god
[50:46] right there is no variance there's
[50:48] there's no variableness there's no
[50:50] shadow of turning in god god is solid
[50:52] god is continuous he is consistent he
[50:54] doesn't change and so he's not going to
[50:56] be one way one day and one day and then
[50:57] the next day he's different amen he
[50:59] stays the same throughout so with that
[51:01] variance is satan working satan's trying
[51:03] to get you to look at him a different
[51:04] way to think that something you've done
[51:06] has changed god
[51:08] nothing changes god the only thing that
[51:10] changes is you
[51:12] and your relationship with him but he
[51:13] doesn't change it's you that's having to
[51:14] do the changing here amen
[51:16] but the brahm says it's a finished work
[51:19] but you've got to accept it as your own
[51:21] personal property it's a love gift a
[51:24] love gift that's why we tie it back to
[51:26] love is because if you know that god
[51:28] loves you and the reason you know he
[51:29] loves you is because he's put his life
[51:31] inside of you because that's what a
[51:33] husband does to a wife that he loves as
[51:35] he puts what himself inside of her
[51:38] right he consummates the marriage that's
[51:40] the expression of love physically so it
[51:42] is with god there is a love gift that
[51:44] god has given you but he would still be
[51:47] the same in his power to manifest
[51:49] himself god working through him he works
[51:51] through his church just like he did
[51:54] through his son
[51:55] he works through his church just like he
[51:57] did his son
[51:58] he says now our kinsmen redeemer has
[52:00] handed the seven seal book of redemption
[52:02] from the original owner when we lost it
[52:04] at the garden of eden through adam it
[52:06] went back to the original owner but
[52:08] there's been a poacher on the land a
[52:10] squatter and that satan he's come over
[52:12] he's a poacher the earth doesn't belong
[52:15] to him it belongs to god but he's a
[52:17] poacher and a squatter
[52:18] he says it's the title deed of our
[52:20] redemption that's what he's saying was
[52:22] opened under those seven seals this
[52:23] seven seal book it's the title deed he
[52:26] says you wait until we get into those
[52:27] seals he breaks the seals and reveals
[52:30] now listen to this he says
[52:32] gives us
[52:34] his inheritance
[52:36] gives us his inheritance to his people
[52:40] he gives the inheritance that he
[52:42] inherited becoming kinsmen redeemer and
[52:45] freely gives it out to us
[52:48] it all belonged to him he was the one
[52:50] who redeemed but instead of keeping it
[52:53] to himself he gives it back to the
[52:56] people that's his love for us as he
[52:59] takes what is his alone and he says no
[53:01] i've got a bride and i'm going to share
[53:03] it with her
[53:04] that she is a part of me and because of
[53:06] that we are what joint heirs with christ
[53:09] amen everything that he has redeemed he
[53:12] says i've given back to my bride amen
[53:15] and so we do not dwell with god and then
[53:17] dwell in gloom and darkness and shame
[53:19] and fear and despair
[53:20] why because we are a coheir with him by
[53:23] his choosing not by ours and he's placed
[53:25] us in a position of faith and light and
[53:28] love
[53:29] and so if we're in the presence of god
[53:31] if we're feeding on the word then we
[53:33] should have that we should have that
[53:34] clarity of purpose and direction in our
[53:36] life because where god is there is light
[53:38] and light always makes manifest it
[53:40] always shows us it always reveals things
[53:43] to us and so we've got this constance of
[53:45] god working in our life to do what show
[53:48] more of him express more of him in our
[53:50] lives amen and then what happens is he
[53:52] drops in and he opens a light in a
[53:53] portion of your life and he gives you a
[53:55] revelation he says this is for you my
[53:57] son
[53:58] this is for you my daughter specifically
[54:00] this is a love gift for you
[54:03] now somebody else could get healing but
[54:05] there's going to be a day where he drops
[54:06] into your heart the revelation that i've
[54:08] healed you as well
[54:10] he's going to say this is for you it's
[54:12] not just a generic scripture that by his
[54:14] stripes we are healed it's by his
[54:16] stripes i am healed and that's the
[54:17] revelation that he drops into our hearts
[54:19] amen brother braham says now what is
[54:21] divine healing does it mean that now
[54:23] that we have to wait till tomorrow night
[54:25] to be healed
[54:26] no sir do i have to come to the church
[54:29] do you have to come to the church to be
[54:31] prayed for do you have to come to the
[54:32] church to have something cast out of you
[54:34] do you have to come to church for
[54:35] deliverance no there's a spirit here to
[54:37] do that amen and that's the holy spirit
[54:39] working in believers but you don't have
[54:41] to he says no sir the moment you believe
[54:44] god and accept it as your personal
[54:47] property it's finished right then
[54:50] now you can come in and you can be
[54:52] prayed for you can say lord give me
[54:54] faith give me strength that has nothing
[54:55] to do with it but he says the moment you
[54:58] accepted it as your personal property
[55:01] it's finished right then that's right
[55:04] when was i healed brother branham i was
[55:06] saved last week i was saved the night
[55:08] before last 10 years ago no you were
[55:10] saved 1900 years ago when jesus died for
[55:13] you at calvary and every redemptive
[55:16] blessing that god has for you jesus said
[55:18] at the cross it is finished everything
[55:20] is done paid for
[55:22] that's why you don't have to march up
[55:23] all cocky and tough and demanding but
[55:25] rather to just walk in and start writing
[55:27] the check and saying lord i have need of
[55:29] healing lord i have need of deliverance
[55:31] lord i have need of wisdom lord i have
[55:33] need of direction lord i have need of
[55:35] discernment
[55:36] lord i have need of strength lord i have
[55:38] need of patience lord i have need of joy
[55:40] amen and what it's coming from the
[55:42] inexhaustible fountain of life that's
[55:44] planted right that you're planted right
[55:45] next to and you just remember drink and
[55:49] push yes write it out drink it push it
[55:52] drink it push it and let him work in it
[55:54] amen
[55:56] amen
[55:58] you don't have to march up like that but
[55:59] you do have to believe
[56:01] you do have to believe you have to go up
[56:03] with a heart of faith with a mouth of
[56:04] faith and say lord i believe
[56:07] look at that little woman amen that said
[56:09] if i can only touch the hem of his
[56:11] garment lots of people touched jesus
[56:13] that day
[56:14] peter said to him lord lots of people
[56:16] have touched you but he says no somebody
[56:18] touched me
[56:20] let's look at the scripture in matthew 9
[56:21] he says and behold a woman which was
[56:23] diseased with an issue of blood
[56:25] 12 years came behind him and touched him
[56:29] and touched the hem of his garment for
[56:31] she said within herself
[56:34] she came with purpose
[56:36] you ever see
[56:38] i know nobody has a tv and nobody looks
[56:39] at things online but did you ever see a
[56:41] celebrity or royalty coming through now
[56:44] you'd never touch royalty these days
[56:45] they'd shoot you down but you see a
[56:47] celebrity somewhere and you see people
[56:49] and what are they doing
[56:50] leaning over the barriers they just want
[56:51] to say i touched tom cruise
[56:54] right
[56:54] i touched tom cruise
[56:57] everybody's doing that they're thronging
[56:58] around them
[56:59] right i touched jesus
[57:02] now that guy everybody's talking about i
[57:03] touched him yesterday
[57:05] that's not what we're here for we're not
[57:07] here for celebrity
[57:09] amen but she comes with a different
[57:11] purpose she says
[57:12] if i may but touch his garment
[57:16] i shall be whole
[57:19] but jesus turned him about and when he
[57:20] saw her he said
[57:22] daughter
[57:23] be of good comfort thy faith hath made
[57:26] thee whole and the woman was made whole
[57:29] from that hour
[57:30] a man like sarah she had a work done in
[57:32] her body that had been constant
[57:35] something had to change in one touch of
[57:36] his garment and she was changed for the
[57:39] rest of her life she had burned all her
[57:40] money on doctors and physicians she
[57:42] tried every healer that came along and
[57:45] nobody could do it and she touched the
[57:47] hem of his garment she didn't even touch
[57:49] his body she just touched the clothing
[57:50] he was wearing and she was healed
[57:53] instantly
[57:54] what healed her
[57:57] luke 8 says then jesus said somebody had
[57:59] touched me
[58:01] for i perceive that virtue
[58:03] has gone out of me
[58:05] what's virtue
[58:06] virtue is strength he says i got weak we
[58:09] saw that in the in the ministry of our
[58:11] prophet
[58:12] and then when god was working through
[58:13] him and a gift was operating what
[58:16] happened was he got weak strength went
[58:18] out of him amen
[58:20] what is it it's something from god
[58:22] you're touching god then you're not
[58:23] touching a man you're touching god is
[58:25] what happens
[58:26] brother braham says this he says now
[58:27] look at here i'm trying to tell you
[58:30] that when that quickening power comes
[58:32] into you it's jesus christ
[58:35] it's jesus christ it's not a man it's
[58:38] not a ministry it's not an idea it's not
[58:40] a theology it's not a doctrine it is
[58:42] christ himself he says when jesus laid
[58:45] his hands on the sick they got well when
[58:47] jesus had quickening power to quicken
[58:49] him as a man he could look out and tell
[58:51] the thoughts that was upon the people
[58:53] tell them what they were thinking about
[58:54] and what they had done have his back
[58:56] turned to them tell them the same thing
[58:57] why do you reason in your hearts the
[58:59] woman touched his garment and he said
[59:01] who touched me he looked around and
[59:04] found her
[59:05] he found her because she'd shrunk back
[59:09] she touched him and then she backed away
[59:11] but he found her
[59:12] and said i perceive virtue has gone out
[59:14] of me your faith has made you whole he
[59:17] says that's jesus christ that proves
[59:20] that where the church is and what the
[59:22] real quickening of power of god
[59:25] does to the human being
[59:27] i'm weak brother john
[59:29] i have no strength i can't fight i'm
[59:31] done i'm finished
[59:32] if you can but touch the hem of his
[59:35] garment
[59:36] what comes in
[59:38] it's not just strength it's christ
[59:40] himself comes in quickening power inside
[59:42] of you to make you do what you've never
[59:44] been able to do for that before amen
[59:47] listen caleb and david did not defeat
[59:49] the giants on their own strength anyways
[59:52] right they were no match they were no
[59:54] match we look at them we say well david
[59:55] had skill with the sleep listen
[59:57] perfect shot one time only if he misses
[1:00:00] that he's a he's a dead turkey
[1:00:01] he's only got one shot to kill him and
[1:00:03] he does it and he fits it through the
[1:00:05] slot this the stone is sized just right
[1:00:07] to find the weakness in his armor and
[1:00:10] that's it he's got one shot to do it he
[1:00:11] rattles that off his helmet goliath's on
[1:00:13] top of him and he's toast right yeah and
[1:00:16] caleb the 85 year old taking on giants
[1:00:19] that are bigger faster stronger meaner
[1:00:20] better weapon
[1:00:21] right caleb didn't beat them by his own
[1:00:23] strength amen he beat them by what
[1:00:25] christ inside of him
[1:00:28] i love the attitude of caleb
[1:00:30] we don't know much about caleb they say
[1:00:32] he was a gentile did you know that
[1:00:34] it's never been confirmed but he doesn't
[1:00:36] have a lineage that we can trace back
[1:00:38] caleb's a mystery inside the scripture
[1:00:40] joshua we know where he comes from caleb
[1:00:41] we don't know where he comes from
[1:00:45] he says now therefore give me this
[1:00:47] mountain
[1:00:48] hallelujah the promise was given yes sir
[1:00:52] now i'm taking the promise
[1:00:54] now therefore give me this mountain
[1:00:55] where of the lord spake in that day the
[1:00:57] lord spake yesterday but today is the
[1:00:59] day that we take it and then there's
[1:01:01] often a span of time between the promise
[1:01:02] and the possession but he says today is
[1:01:05] when i want to go in and possess for
[1:01:07] thou heardst in that day how the anakims
[1:01:09] were there and that the cities were
[1:01:10] great and fenced he says this is a big
[1:01:12] job he says i want to go in today and
[1:01:13] take care of it
[1:01:15] if so be the lord will be with me then i
[1:01:18] shall be able to drive them out as the
[1:01:19] lord said now he's just said i'm as
[1:01:21] strong as i was the day god gave it to
[1:01:22] me but he doesn't say i'm going to drive
[1:01:24] them out because i'm strong he says if
[1:01:25] the lord's with me i'll drive them out
[1:01:27] and then he still understands that his
[1:01:29] strength is in the lord amen that it's
[1:01:31] by his spirit he's putting them out it's
[1:01:32] not by the arm of flesh amen
[1:01:34] amen caleb's holding god to what the
[1:01:36] promise that he gave and the land that
[1:01:38] he's claiming is the land that he has
[1:01:40] walked in caleb doesn't want some other
[1:01:42] portion of land that he hasn't seen
[1:01:44] caleb wants the original land he wants
[1:01:46] to go to the land where the original
[1:01:47] blessing was the original proof was he
[1:01:50] wants to go to the original source that
[1:01:51] the land is flowing with milk and honey
[1:01:53] he says that's the only place i want and
[1:01:55] i want it because god promised it to me
[1:01:57] but he says i've been there i know what
[1:01:59] that land is i know what it can do i
[1:02:01] know what it produces and i'm not
[1:02:02] satisfied don't put me off on some other
[1:02:05] piece of land i know it's going to be
[1:02:06] tough to take it but he says that's
[1:02:08] where the original is and i won't be
[1:02:10] satisfied with anything less than the
[1:02:11] original let everyone take the other
[1:02:13] land i want to go back to where the
[1:02:14] proof is and then what do we have a
[1:02:16] prophet do in this day he took us back
[1:02:17] to the original wasn't it he restored us
[1:02:20] back and said go back to the original go
[1:02:21] back to the faith of the original
[1:02:23] fathers go back to the truly revealed
[1:02:25] word and there you know you're going to
[1:02:26] get what you need to go amen if you can
[1:02:29] go back to where the proof was taken
[1:02:30] before then you'll get the same proof
[1:02:32] today you'll get the same results you'll
[1:02:34] get the same blessings you'll get the
[1:02:35] same manifestation that they had in
[1:02:37] those days
[1:02:38] amen you'll also have the same battle
[1:02:39] they had in those days
[1:02:41] amen caleb wasn't satisfied to go
[1:02:43] someplace else he said i want to go
[1:02:45] where god gave me the original
[1:02:46] revelation amen now he's not blind to
[1:02:49] the challenges
[1:02:50] i love that about caleb remember he
[1:02:52] speaks his speaking is of what the word
[1:02:54] says but he recognizes there's a battle
[1:02:57] ahead he says this is the land of the
[1:02:59] anakims this is the big guys and they've
[1:03:00] got big cities that are great and fence
[1:03:02] this is not going to be a cakewalk it's
[1:03:04] not going to be a walk in the park but
[1:03:06] yet i'm going to take them because the
[1:03:07] lord is going to be with me
[1:03:09] amen we aren't blind to what we're going
[1:03:11] through we cannot sit there and say i
[1:03:13] don't have a problem we can't sit there
[1:03:15] and say i don't have an issue i don't
[1:03:17] have a weakness that i don't need help
[1:03:19] that i don't need to change that i don't
[1:03:20] need strength that is not what we do but
[1:03:22] we go to the original source and say
[1:03:24] that's where i need to go and i'll fight
[1:03:26] for anything that's at the original
[1:03:27] source amen if i can find it in the word
[1:03:29] of god if i can find the promise of god
[1:03:31] there i know i'll be okay amen we've got
[1:03:34] to go back to where we know the proof is
[1:03:36] and then what we don't pretend we're not
[1:03:38] facing something
[1:03:40] sometimes we do that and we say well i'm
[1:03:41] speaking in faith brother no you've got
[1:03:43] to recognize brother brahm said you got
[1:03:45] to recognize that satan is there and
[1:03:46] he's real amen and you've got to be able
[1:03:48] to recognize what you're facing and if
[1:03:50] you recognize what you're facing is big
[1:03:52] that's when we step back and say okay
[1:03:53] lord we really need some help and
[1:03:56] sometimes we've got to go to another
[1:03:57] brother or sister we got to go to the
[1:03:58] church and say i need more i need you to
[1:04:00] pray for me i need you to to bind with
[1:04:02] me in faith and let's push this through
[1:04:04] and i need somebody to be accountable to
[1:04:06] or i need somebody to keep up with me
[1:04:08] and i need to to have more fellowship
[1:04:09] will you help these sorts of things
[1:04:11] right we look to the body for those
[1:04:12] things to help us out
[1:04:15] brother braham says this he says now
[1:04:16] that's how we come we are abraham's seed
[1:04:19] and we call the things the symptoms our
[1:04:22] afflictions our diseases as though they
[1:04:24] were not because we are obeying what the
[1:04:27] holy spirit said through the prophet the
[1:04:30] seer has said to be the truth he doesn't
[1:04:32] say you don't have symptoms that you
[1:04:34] don't say you don't have symptoms but he
[1:04:36] says we speak as though they are not we
[1:04:38] do not dwell on them we do not rest on
[1:04:40] them we do not focus on them we can say
[1:04:42] the symptom says this but the word says
[1:04:44] that and i'm going to say what the word
[1:04:46] says from here on amen it's no problem
[1:04:48] to tell somebody
[1:04:49] again brother ron i keep up with them
[1:04:51] he'll say i've had a bad week he's got
[1:04:54] no problem saying i've had a bad week
[1:04:55] but then he says but i'm here in service
[1:04:57] still amen i'm still in service i'm
[1:04:59] still fighting the battle i'm still
[1:05:00] preaching i'm still doing my part i'm
[1:05:02] still putting my shoulder to the will
[1:05:03] i'm still using my gift his confession
[1:05:05] and his energy is to produce the word
[1:05:08] regardless of what the symptoms are
[1:05:09] saying and that's what we want to do is
[1:05:10] we want to confess we want to act on
[1:05:12] what the word says and push everything
[1:05:14] else to the side you can say it's there
[1:05:16] it's no problem no problem say somebody
[1:05:18] i got a headache today
[1:05:19] but say i'm doing what i need to do
[1:05:20] regardless of the headache
[1:05:22] you know or whatever the situation might
[1:05:24] be
[1:05:24] he says
[1:05:26] and all men through the ages accepted it
[1:05:28] and has come out right every time
[1:05:32] he says now we are calling these things
[1:05:35] right and accepting them as our personal
[1:05:38] property and wooing back to the holy
[1:05:41] spirit
[1:05:42] your word is true i'll refuse any other
[1:05:45] symptom anything else i believe that
[1:05:47] you'll make me well because thy word
[1:05:49] lord says the prayer of faith shall save
[1:05:51] the sick and god shall raise them up
[1:05:54] that's all
[1:05:55] that's the truth
[1:05:57] but what's the difference here he says
[1:05:59] what
[1:06:00] accepting them as our personal property
[1:06:02] we read about the seven seal he said
[1:06:04] that when that book's open what is it
[1:06:06] it's the title deed guess what a title
[1:06:08] deeds no good without a name on it
[1:06:10] you've got a description of the property
[1:06:12] but there has to be an owner's name
[1:06:13] written there and the difference here is
[1:06:15] will you say my name is on the title
[1:06:17] deed will you accept that your name is
[1:06:19] written on the title deed it is if you
[1:06:21] can only accept it because as soon as
[1:06:23] you know that you've got a title deed to
[1:06:24] it then you know that you can put off
[1:06:25] anything that's on your property amen
[1:06:29] caleb says my name's on the title deed
[1:06:31] that day 45 years ago god wrote my name
[1:06:34] on the title deed for hebron
[1:06:37] now i want it because i want to go in
[1:06:38] and get it amen my name's on the deed
[1:06:41] i'm going in to get it today amen that's
[1:06:43] what we're here for we're here for what
[1:06:45] god said was ours
[1:06:46] nothing else but what god said i mean
[1:06:49] that's where our energy that's where our
[1:06:50] focus has to be is what god said was
[1:06:52] ours because he's the one that's going
[1:06:53] to make sure the bank account's full
[1:06:55] for the things that he said are ours
[1:06:57] right if god said the bank accounts for
[1:06:59] your needs and i want to go buy a
[1:07:00] ferrari
[1:07:01] guess what
[1:07:02] it's not there for that
[1:07:04] that'll bounce
[1:07:06] amen we don't use the word to go get
[1:07:07] things that we want we go to get what he
[1:07:09] said is in the word in the first place
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:13] brother brown says people come to christ
[1:07:16] today
[1:07:17] lovely people and accept the lord jesus
[1:07:19] and say i love you lord jesus
[1:07:21] and go back and think that's all of it
[1:07:24] why you just entered the door to a great
[1:07:26] big compartment store and arcade you
[1:07:28] know if i inherited anything if somebody
[1:07:29] gave me a home i'd sure look it all
[1:07:31] through i'd go upstairs downstairs in
[1:07:33] the pantry all around the house i'd see
[1:07:35] what i owned he says but the trouble is
[1:07:37] of it is is today people just get saved
[1:07:40] and say well this is all of it he says
[1:07:42] oh my you've got every redemptive
[1:07:44] blessing jesus died for as your personal
[1:07:47] property amen he says get up and look
[1:07:49] around and see what you own
[1:07:52] and then we spoke last service about how
[1:07:53] do we lose the holy spirit we confess
[1:07:55] the word of god amen this is not some
[1:07:57] prosperity gospel when you look at them
[1:07:59] that's what they say speak the word
[1:08:01] speak the word that is not what we are
[1:08:02] doing here amen we're not doing it
[1:08:04] according to the lust of the flesh we're
[1:08:05] not here to build a kingdom on this
[1:08:07] earth we're not here to make big dollars
[1:08:08] and have big homes and all these
[1:08:10] different things but we speak the word
[1:08:11] according to the inspiration of the
[1:08:13] spirit so that we are not presuming and
[1:08:15] we're not pretending and so we can have
[1:08:17] expectation that what we say will happen
[1:08:19] let me tell you everyone sitting under
[1:08:21] joel olsteen or chris lowe dollars
[1:08:22] ministry does not become a millionaire
[1:08:24] and yet they're all speaking the word to
[1:08:25] become millionaires why is that because
[1:08:28] the word's not there to support it
[1:08:29] amen they're speaking out of the lust of
[1:08:31] their own hearts amen but we are basing
[1:08:33] what we speak on our faith on the
[1:08:35] unchanging word of god that he will do
[1:08:36] what he said he will do
[1:08:39] abraham says we belong to a kingdom and
[1:08:41] the kingdom is the word of god made
[1:08:43] spirit and life in our own life
[1:08:48] the kingdom is the word of god
[1:08:51] made spirit and life in our own life
[1:08:54] bringing what does that look like
[1:08:56] bringing to pass every promise in this
[1:08:59] day as it did in that day when the word
[1:09:02] and god was won
[1:09:05] that's the high standard that's the bar
[1:09:07] is what god united in man and women amen
[1:09:13] and the word and god is one in his
[1:09:14] church today making it the headship of
[1:09:16] the body that is redeemed to bring the
[1:09:19] message in the last day and be taken up
[1:09:22] from the dead in the resurrection to go
[1:09:24] back and restore again as adam and eve
[1:09:26] in the beginning in the garden of eden
[1:09:30] what is it the word and flesh becoming
[1:09:33] one what was caleb talking about he said
[1:09:35] the word needs to become flesh today
[1:09:38] amen the word that i was given needs to
[1:09:40] be manifested today
[1:09:41] he said so let's go get it done amen he
[1:09:43] says i was given the promise and now
[1:09:46] he's coming to joshua now catch this
[1:09:48] joshua's a type of what the holy spirit
[1:09:50] so the believer comes to the holy spirit
[1:09:53] and says
[1:09:54] you promised it
[1:09:56] i'm ready
[1:09:57] can i go take it amen he's coming to the
[1:10:00] holy spirit he's asking permission he's
[1:10:02] saying you're the one that gives me the
[1:10:04] unction
[1:10:05] this is what i feel in my heart to do
[1:10:07] can i do it
[1:10:09] and what does joshua do
[1:10:11] it says and joshua blessed him and gave
[1:10:13] unto caleb the son of jafuna hebron for
[1:10:16] an inheritance
[1:10:17] holy spirit said yes
[1:10:20] i give it to you
[1:10:21] i said it before now i'm giving it to
[1:10:23] you
[1:10:24] hebron therefore became the inheritance
[1:10:26] of caleb the son of jefuna the kennezite
[1:10:28] unto this day because that he wholly
[1:10:31] followed the lord god of israel he never
[1:10:33] backslid he never deviated right or left
[1:10:35] he never moved off the word he never
[1:10:36] moved off support of the proper ministry
[1:10:38] but he stayed right in the channel of
[1:10:40] god's will all the way up until he got
[1:10:41] his
[1:10:42] and then he never went off of it again
[1:10:44] he never went off at the start he got
[1:10:46] the promise and then he didn't just say
[1:10:47] well i got what i want and then walk
[1:10:48] away from god no he stayed true to the
[1:10:50] word of god until his death amen
[1:10:54] he held it nobody took it from caleb
[1:10:55] after that
[1:10:57] now you can look at caleb and guess what
[1:10:59] caleb's relatives aren't so good
[1:11:01] remember um
[1:11:04] the one that david almost tried almost
[1:11:05] killed
[1:11:07] remember
[1:11:09] and his wife came and saved him
[1:11:11] naboth no no no nabel
[1:11:13] nabel's a child nabel's a relative of
[1:11:15] caleb okay the apple does occasionally
[1:11:18] fall far from the tree
[1:11:19] right
[1:11:20] but caleb
[1:11:21] that land was given to him and his
[1:11:23] generations forever the scripture says
[1:11:25] because he stayed holy with the word of
[1:11:27] god and he took the word of god and put
[1:11:29] it into action and went and claimed it
[1:11:31] and god was with him amen
[1:11:33] now that's great you say that's caleb
[1:11:34] what about us
[1:11:37] let's go to revelation 10.
[1:11:42] amen revelation 10.
[1:11:50] we can probably quote the scripture by
[1:11:52] memory
[1:11:54] 10 1 says and i saw another mighty angel
[1:11:56] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:11:58] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:12:00] and his face was as it were the sun and
[1:12:02] his feet as pillars of fire
[1:12:04] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:12:06] open
[1:12:07] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:12:09] and his left foot on the earth and then
[1:12:11] he's coming now with dominion amen right
[1:12:13] he was a lamb originally now he's coming
[1:12:15] as a lion he's coming as a king he's
[1:12:16] coming as a judge he's coming with
[1:12:18] dominion because his feet are on land
[1:12:19] and sea the entire earth is under his
[1:12:21] feet amen
[1:12:24] and cried but i notice here he had a
[1:12:26] little book open
[1:12:28] you look in revelation 5 books not open
[1:12:30] that's right but when he comes down now
[1:12:32] the book is open
[1:12:33] he says in crime with a loud voice as
[1:12:36] when a lion roareth and when he had
[1:12:37] cried seven thunders uttered their
[1:12:39] voices and when the seven thunders had
[1:12:41] uttered their voices i was about to
[1:12:43] write and i heard a voice from heaven
[1:12:45] saying unto me seal up those things
[1:12:46] which is seven thunders uttered and
[1:12:48] write them not and the angel which i saw
[1:12:51] stand upon the scene upon the earth
[1:12:52] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:12:54] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[1:12:56] created heaven and the things that
[1:12:58] therein are in the earth and the things
[1:12:59] that therein are and the sea and the
[1:13:01] things that therein that there should be
[1:13:03] time no longer
[1:13:04] now who is this
[1:13:06] it says it swear by the what
[1:13:09] it swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:13:11] ever we're not allowed to swear by god
[1:13:13] but remember god swore by himself
[1:13:16] this is god himself this is christ
[1:13:18] standing here with the open book in his
[1:13:19] hand because he took it and then the
[1:13:21] land lamb came from behind the throne
[1:13:23] right bloody as it had been slain he
[1:13:26] came out and he takes the book and now
[1:13:27] it's open in revelation 10. he's coming
[1:13:29] down with an open book and he roars as a
[1:13:31] lion he comes down as a king now
[1:13:33] and he's coming with the open book and
[1:13:35] he says there should be time no longer
[1:13:37] what does that mean was the mean time
[1:13:38] she'll be no longer
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:42] it means
[1:13:43] this is under the opening of the seventh
[1:13:44] seal and it means that
[1:13:47] to the believer there's an ending of our
[1:13:49] time on earth there's an ending of time
[1:13:51] in general because this stretches all
[1:13:53] the way from the opening of the seals
[1:13:55] all the way through to the end of the
[1:13:56] millennium this is a long time
[1:13:58] it's a long time but for the believer
[1:14:00] for the gentile bride this is the ending
[1:14:03] of our time on earth right when he comes
[1:14:05] down and he opens he has an open book
[1:14:07] what's he doing with the book he starts
[1:14:09] calling names
[1:14:10] right we start reading title deeds and
[1:14:13] all of a sudden we have a possession we
[1:14:14] have a claim that's here we take that
[1:14:16] and then we get off the earth and we go
[1:14:17] and rule and reign with him
[1:14:19] amen but what is it when he says there
[1:14:21] should be time no longer to the believer
[1:14:23] that means there will be an end to all
[1:14:24] of satan's influences there'll be an end
[1:14:26] to all of satan's twisting and
[1:14:28] manipulating and there will be an end to
[1:14:29] all our all of our trials and struggles
[1:14:32] what's it saying the end of time for us
[1:14:34] is rest
[1:14:35] and then we go into a marriage supper we
[1:14:36] go with him and he wipes away every tear
[1:14:38] from our eyes and then there'll be no
[1:14:40] remembering the things that are behind
[1:14:42] us
[1:14:42] amen what do we have we just have
[1:14:44] eternity ahead of us with our god with
[1:14:46] our husband with our savior amen
[1:14:49] and then what happens is we have a quick
[1:14:50] short work before they're going away yes
[1:14:52] amen and that's what we're talking about
[1:14:54] here before that end of time he comes
[1:14:56] down he has a quick short work in his
[1:14:57] bride and there's a manifestation there
[1:14:59] that hasn't happened since the book of
[1:15:00] acts and inside of that time is when we
[1:15:03] have what the full possession of what
[1:15:05] he's given us here on earth amen
[1:15:07] what is it it's the world be the word
[1:15:09] being revealed again alpha and omega
[1:15:12] god was in flesh god's back in flesh
[1:15:14] through all of it he's been working to
[1:15:16] restore it but now he comes back in he
[1:15:17] steps into flesh one more time it's the
[1:15:20] fullness of god in his people amen
[1:15:22] he says but in the days of the voice of
[1:15:24] the seventh angel
[1:15:25] are we in the days of the voice of the
[1:15:27] seventh angel he's already sounded he's
[1:15:29] already sounded so we're right here we
[1:15:31] are right here when he shall begin to
[1:15:34] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:15:35] finished as he had declared to his
[1:15:37] servants the prophets and then we know
[1:15:39] the mystery of god's threefold god above
[1:15:41] us god with us and god in us so if it's
[1:15:43] going to be finished we've already had
[1:15:44] god above us we've always
[1:15:47] already had jesus christ on earth god
[1:15:48] with us so all that's left is god in us
[1:15:51] amen the same fullness it's always a
[1:15:53] fullness so we have now the same
[1:15:55] fullness of god with us amen it's all
[1:15:58] the word it's all the same god but three
[1:16:00] different ways and three different
[1:16:00] manifestations amen
[1:16:03] amen so now we come to the caleb portion
[1:16:06] all through there all of our first seven
[1:16:08] that's god's grace that's god's work
[1:16:09] that's the lamb's work that's christ's
[1:16:11] work that's him him him but now look at
[1:16:13] verse eight it says and the voice which
[1:16:15] i heard from heaven spake unto me again
[1:16:19] and said
[1:16:20] go and take the little book which is
[1:16:22] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:16:24] standeth upon the sea
[1:16:26] and upon the earth
[1:16:28] what pushes john forward here
[1:16:31] nobody was worthy to take it before i
[1:16:34] john wept because nobody was worthy to
[1:16:36] take it but now somebody says to john go
[1:16:39] and take the book
[1:16:41] so if john can go and take the book
[1:16:44] john must now be worthy
[1:16:46] right john must have had something
[1:16:48] happen to him to make him worthy because
[1:16:50] before he's crying and the whole earth
[1:16:52] is crying because he's not worthy but
[1:16:54] now john steps forward because a voice
[1:16:56] from heaven says to step forward there's
[1:16:59] a voice from heaven speaking that this
[1:17:01] is the time john for you to take the
[1:17:03] book
[1:17:04] you've got something to do with the book
[1:17:06] now it wasn't just the lamb now somebody
[1:17:08] else is stepping forward somebody else
[1:17:10] has been made worthy and it's not
[1:17:12] because he's a prophet that he's worthy
[1:17:14] it's because heaven says you're worthy
[1:17:16] now's the time to take the book amen
[1:17:18] what is it it's the holy spirit
[1:17:20] quickening us to tell us take the book
[1:17:22] this isn't just for a prophet this isn't
[1:17:24] just for the lamb this is for the bride
[1:17:27] of christ amen
[1:17:28] amen the holy spirit isn't didn't just
[1:17:30] speak through brother branham but the
[1:17:32] holy spirit is speaking to us because
[1:17:34] the prophet came and said what every
[1:17:36] redemptive blessing in the bible belongs
[1:17:38] to you everything that christ died for
[1:17:41] belongs to you and he died to restore us
[1:17:43] back to our eating condition
[1:17:44] so everything is contained within that
[1:17:46] yes everything to restore you back to
[1:17:48] your original condition amen
[1:17:51] it's not that it didn't belong to the
[1:17:52] people before but they weren't quick
[1:17:53] into it he says now is the time of
[1:17:55] quickening now is the time for reading
[1:17:57] the title deed
[1:17:59] what's he saying rise take up the land
[1:18:00] today is the day except for the brahms
[1:18:02] said it's been it's been what 50 60 70
[1:18:05] years since he started telling people
[1:18:06] every promise in the book is yours
[1:18:10] every promise in the book is yours he
[1:18:12] says if thou can't believe all things
[1:18:13] are possible only believe right only
[1:18:16] believe
[1:18:17] glory what did john do did john shrink
[1:18:19] back and say no no no i'm not worthy
[1:18:22] i know i'm not worthy
[1:18:24] i know i'm not worthy
[1:18:26] but i'm not taking it because i'm worthy
[1:18:28] i'm taking it because he said to take it
[1:18:31] and so john in obedience now says and i
[1:18:34] went to the angel and said unto him give
[1:18:37] me the little
[1:18:38] book give me the little book and he said
[1:18:41] to me it's a warning take it and eat it
[1:18:44] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:18:46] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:18:48] honey amen any experienced believer will
[1:18:50] tell you the promises are great in your
[1:18:52] mouth but it's a whole different animal
[1:18:55] when it gets down to your belly isn't it
[1:18:57] and then the sweet taste of victory you
[1:18:58] say i'm going in knowing i've got the
[1:19:00] victory but you got to go through the
[1:19:01] battle before the victory becomes a
[1:19:03] reality in you and the battle is never
[1:19:05] fun if our battles are easy if our
[1:19:08] battles are simple then we didn't have a
[1:19:09] battle at all
[1:19:11] right it's not a battle if there's no
[1:19:12] struggle
[1:19:13] amen we are up against an enemy that has
[1:19:15] been uh fortifying himself as building
[1:19:18] up his his categories of weapons and the
[1:19:20] tactics for 7 000 years on humanity it's
[1:19:24] a battle when you're fighting satan amen
[1:19:26] there is a battle there and even the
[1:19:27] children of israel went through and they
[1:19:28] had to have their battles even christ
[1:19:30] had his battles amen he did not come
[1:19:32] through the 40 days of temptation in the
[1:19:34] wilderness fresh as a daisy he came
[1:19:36] through and he needed to be sustained by
[1:19:37] angels when he was done by it
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:41] amen find people you know that have come
[1:19:43] through the greatest struggles and they
[1:19:44] don't say
[1:19:45] yeah it was easy bud
[1:19:47] no problem i'll do it again tomorrow
[1:19:49] it'll be no big deal satan's got nothing
[1:19:50] on me no they'll say it was brutal it
[1:19:53] was a struggle it was exhausting there
[1:19:56] were days i didn't know if i could make
[1:19:57] it through there were days i didn't want
[1:19:58] to get out of bed
[1:20:00] there were days i wasn't sure if i was a
[1:20:01] christian there were days i didn't know
[1:20:03] if i had the holy ghost
[1:20:04] you say how did you make it through
[1:20:07] you just keep striking with the sword of
[1:20:08] the spirit you take what the word of god
[1:20:10] says about you
[1:20:12] and you say it doesn't matter what the
[1:20:13] symptoms say doesn't say what i see
[1:20:16] matters what he said about me in the
[1:20:18] word and you keep striking and striking
[1:20:20] and striking until a hole appears in the
[1:20:21] enemy amen
[1:20:23] yes sir john says
[1:20:26] he said give it to me
[1:20:28] it says and i took the little book out
[1:20:30] of the angel's hand and ate it up
[1:20:32] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:20:34] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[1:20:36] was bitter as soon as i had eaten it you
[1:20:38] say i'm going to claim the promise and
[1:20:39] it's going to be easy as soon as you've
[1:20:41] eaten it truly eating it
[1:20:44] the battle starts amen and it's bitter
[1:20:46] in your belly it's difficult to digest
[1:20:50] and he said unto me
[1:20:52] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:20:54] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:20:56] kings did john ever do that
[1:20:59] he got off and he talked to a few people
[1:21:01] but he didn't do that
[1:21:03] that's not his portion that's the
[1:21:05] bride's portion amen because a caleb
[1:21:07] comes again a john comes again a bride
[1:21:08] comes again and says what this is my
[1:21:11] book too
[1:21:12] and then the holy spirit quickens that
[1:21:14] we had a prophet come a malachi 4
[1:21:15] prophet that came and said the title
[1:21:17] deed has been opened up and it's time
[1:21:19] for you to now be restored back to what
[1:21:21] you had not on the day of pentecost but
[1:21:23] in the garden of eden amen we're going
[1:21:25] all the way back to the beginning now
[1:21:27] because that's where the title deed
[1:21:28] takes us amen
[1:21:30] brother braham says this he says for
[1:21:31] they are worthy do you realize who is
[1:21:33] saying this this is on the in the
[1:21:35] sardisian church age he says it is jesus
[1:21:37] the worthy one himself this is the only
[1:21:40] one who is accounted worthy to take the
[1:21:42] book out of the hand of him who sits on
[1:21:44] the throne and now this worthy one is
[1:21:46] saying to all of his saints you
[1:21:48] are
[1:21:49] worthy
[1:21:51] here is this one the only one qualified
[1:21:54] to judge and indeed all judgment is
[1:21:56] committed unto him and he says you are
[1:21:59] worthy these words are as astounding as
[1:22:01] they are words in romans 8 33 that says
[1:22:04] god says i am righteous
[1:22:07] there in the white light of god's
[1:22:09] righteousness hear the sweet voice of
[1:22:11] jesus as he says these are mine they are
[1:22:14] righteous they are worthy they shall
[1:22:17] walk with me in white amen are you
[1:22:20] worthy
[1:22:21] i am because he said not because i am
[1:22:23] but because he said amen that he has
[1:22:26] made me worthy amen in christ we are
[1:22:28] accepted amen
[1:22:29] what's written in this book
[1:22:31] what is it it's the title deed it's the
[1:22:32] lamb's book of life
[1:22:34] we can call it two things we can say
[1:22:35] it's a separate book or we can say it's
[1:22:37] a chapter within the book of life amen
[1:22:39] but it is the portion that cannot be
[1:22:42] edited
[1:22:43] it is written and it cannot be changed
[1:22:45] it cannot be added to it cannot be taken
[1:22:47] from it is the lamb's book of life and
[1:22:49] your name cannot be taken out of that
[1:22:52] god doesn't add to it and god doesn't
[1:22:53] take it away from it because it is the
[1:22:55] word it is his representation in flesh
[1:22:58] and god is unchanging so how can he
[1:22:59] change the book that has his word
[1:23:00] written in it as well amen so within
[1:23:03] there you have a place that there can be
[1:23:05] no removing of names once your name is
[1:23:07] on the title deed and it always was on
[1:23:09] the title deed there's no taking it off
[1:23:11] amen nothing you do or say good or bad
[1:23:13] can never make a change to that amen but
[1:23:15] within that book i written every
[1:23:17] redemptive promise that christ died for
[1:23:19] on the on the cross of calvary and that
[1:23:21] means that that's a part of your title
[1:23:23] deed
[1:23:24] no matter what within within the land of
[1:23:26] canaan everybody had a different portion
[1:23:28] some lived on the sea some lived up in
[1:23:30] the mountains some lived in the valley
[1:23:31] some lived in the plains we've all got a
[1:23:33] portion and there's different giants on
[1:23:35] it there's different things facing us
[1:23:36] we've got different style trials and
[1:23:38] struggles look around look around you'll
[1:23:40] see that that the front row has
[1:23:41] different things in the next row than
[1:23:43] the next row we don't all deal with the
[1:23:44] same things we don't all have the same
[1:23:45] giants we have a portion that's just for
[1:23:48] us and that portion is to what bring out
[1:23:50] the word that god put in us as well and
[1:23:51] we need those giants to bring out those
[1:23:53] portions
[1:23:54] and when if we shrink away if we pull
[1:23:56] away then god can't be manifested but
[1:23:58] we've got to commit ourselves to the
[1:23:59] battle we've got to commit ourselves to
[1:24:01] taking what's in that title deed and
[1:24:02] saying lord it is mine
[1:24:04] you said it's mine and i want to take it
[1:24:06] amen
[1:24:08] but abraham says now remember we died in
[1:24:10] our own name
[1:24:12] was buried and raised in his
[1:24:15] see we're no more of our own of which
[1:24:17] that great name of jesus christ which
[1:24:18] the bible said over here in ephesians 1
[1:24:20] 21 that both families in heaven and
[1:24:23] earth is named after that name that's
[1:24:25] where god put his name that's the family
[1:24:27] name in heaven and that's the family's
[1:24:29] name on earth
[1:24:30] and we're in jesus christ by spiritual
[1:24:33] baptism not by water by spirit we're
[1:24:35] baptized into one body which is christ
[1:24:38] the worshipping place
[1:24:39] then being in there we are being on this
[1:24:42] ground it's like the abstract deed you
[1:24:44] say i bought a piece of ground it isn't
[1:24:46] yours yet until you've got an abstract
[1:24:49] now we don't deal with this the same way
[1:24:50] they do in the u.s their title system is
[1:24:52] way different down there way more
[1:24:53] complex but if you've got an he says if
[1:24:55] you've got an abstract it shows that
[1:24:57] everything was ever against that piece
[1:24:59] of ground has been stricken off because
[1:25:00] a piece of land can have people that
[1:25:02] have rights for minerals
[1:25:04] they can have rights of access they can
[1:25:06] have liens against it for work that was
[1:25:08] done for debts that road and so in the
[1:25:10] states it's a big deal for title in
[1:25:11] canada we don't actually own the
[1:25:13] property it's still crown land i don't
[1:25:14] know if you know that we get the right
[1:25:16] to live on it but we don't own the land
[1:25:18] but in the united states you own the
[1:25:20] land if you have a title to it you own
[1:25:21] everything
[1:25:22] above it and below it to a certain depth
[1:25:24] that's yours okay and nobody can take it
[1:25:27] away but you have to have an abstract
[1:25:29] deed otherwise somebody else has a right
[1:25:31] to do something on your property and he
[1:25:32] says when you're baptized in he says
[1:25:34] you've got an abstract deed every price
[1:25:36] was paid at calvary there's nothing that
[1:25:39] can be charged against the elect it's
[1:25:40] all been paid so the title deed is free
[1:25:43] and clear it's now an abstract title
[1:25:45] deed and there is nothing that has a
[1:25:47] right to keep you from your property
[1:25:50] he says and then when you become a
[1:25:51] christian and accept christ as your
[1:25:53] savior then when god sends down the
[1:25:55] abstract it shows no matter what your
[1:25:57] father did your mother did good or bad
[1:26:01] when ellie what anybody else did your
[1:26:03] mother daddy might have been drunkards
[1:26:04] prostitutes whatever it was every sin is
[1:26:07] stricken off you've got an abstract
[1:26:09] title and there's nothing can put you
[1:26:11] off of it and look everything that's on
[1:26:14] that ground belongs to you
[1:26:16] amen and when you're in christ jesus by
[1:26:18] the baptism of the holy ghost every gift
[1:26:21] of god belongs in the church but it's by
[1:26:24] the holy ghost
[1:26:25] it's not by sitting in a message church
[1:26:26] it's not by sitting under a revealed
[1:26:28] word it's by the holy ghost that you get
[1:26:30] this he says amen it's an abstract title
[1:26:33] deed you
[1:26:34] it's yours it belongs to you
[1:26:38] let me put it this way me
[1:26:40] it's mine it belongs to me
[1:26:43] me
[1:26:44] it's mine it belongs to me it quickens
[1:26:47] your mortal bodies he says oh my if we
[1:26:49] think about it amen we talk about
[1:26:51] quickening power
[1:26:54] did you know you've experienced
[1:26:55] quickening power
[1:26:57] we often don't realize what quickening
[1:26:58] power is quickening power is what takes
[1:27:00] the word out of your mind and puts it
[1:27:02] into your life and then it takes it off
[1:27:04] the pages of your bible it takes it out
[1:27:05] of the messages that you hear and list
[1:27:07] and and read in these things and it
[1:27:09] takes it and it makes it live out of you
[1:27:10] because quickening means to make alive
[1:27:13] amen so it's not that it drops it into
[1:27:15] your head with great understanding but
[1:27:16] it drops it into your life with great
[1:27:18] effect and then that's what we're
[1:27:20] looking for is a quickening power it's a
[1:27:22] super charging effect that takes it out
[1:27:23] of your head and puts it into a way that
[1:27:25] you can live it out in your life amen
[1:27:27] and it's such a reality when it happens
[1:27:29] that you'll ever wonder how did i live
[1:27:31] before this
[1:27:32] how did i ever sit there and think that
[1:27:34] i was something great before this
[1:27:36] because you don't know what you don't
[1:27:37] have until you get something else we
[1:27:40] don't know what we're missing until we
[1:27:41] get something that we didn't realize we
[1:27:42] didn't have right there's something that
[1:27:44] happens with this and it supercharges
[1:27:46] the word and all of a sudden you've got
[1:27:47] something inside of you and it's pushing
[1:27:49] it out
[1:27:50] amen you can drink it in but you've got
[1:27:51] to have the holy spirit to help push it
[1:27:53] out in your life
[1:27:54] amen
[1:27:56] but the biggest thing that quickening
[1:27:58] power is here to do is to give the word
[1:28:00] preeminence in our life
[1:28:02] because of its quickening power it's got
[1:28:04] to be christ that lives within me not me
[1:28:06] it's not i that liveth but christ that
[1:28:08] live within me the scripture says that's
[1:28:09] what cleaning power is is when christ is
[1:28:11] living so perfectly
[1:28:13] through you
[1:28:14] amen
[1:28:15] almost done brother braham says we
[1:28:17] should realize that in us has been given
[1:28:20] we who believe jesus christ have been
[1:28:22] born of his spirit and filled with that
[1:28:23] quickening power that power that's in
[1:28:26] you by laying on hands on the others
[1:28:28] like the disciples did and down through
[1:28:30] the age it absolutely healed the sick
[1:28:33] raised the dead it showed visions and
[1:28:35] prophecies
[1:28:37] and that very same spirit that lived
[1:28:38] amongst the early apostles is living in
[1:28:40] the church today working the very same
[1:28:42] things
[1:28:43] now that's hard to believe sometimes
[1:28:44] since the prophet left
[1:28:46] because you had so much in that one
[1:28:48] ministry that one man
[1:28:50] and you're looking for that but it
[1:28:52] wasn't only meant to be like that it was
[1:28:54] supposed to be little portions in
[1:28:56] everyone
[1:28:57] and so it's so much harder to see the
[1:28:59] word working maybe in somebody when
[1:29:01] you're expecting to see you know that
[1:29:03] the the discernment and great visions
[1:29:05] and great healings and whatnot
[1:29:07] but guess what really when you look at
[1:29:09] the original church it says to one is
[1:29:10] given this and another that and another
[1:29:12] this and another that what you had in a
[1:29:14] prophet was you had almost the whole
[1:29:15] package there and so we're looking to be
[1:29:17] like the prophet we're saying well it's
[1:29:18] supposed to be like the prophet no it's
[1:29:20] supposed to be like it was in the book
[1:29:21] of acts which is everybody had something
[1:29:24] amen so that's what we're looking for is
[1:29:26] the same spirit that lived among those
[1:29:27] early apostles living within the
[1:29:29] framework of the church everybody
[1:29:32] brothers and sisters alike amen each in
[1:29:35] their position and each in their place
[1:29:37] he says and as quick as we can recognize
[1:29:39] that see no matter how much it's working
[1:29:41] you've got to recognize that and believe
[1:29:43] it it won't do you one bit of good until
[1:29:46] you believe it but the moment you
[1:29:48] believe it your troubles are ended the
[1:29:52] moment you believe it you really believe
[1:29:54] it
[1:29:55] the moment it's a revelation to you that
[1:29:57] god has given this to me and it is his
[1:29:58] will for my life he says that's when
[1:30:01] your troubles are ended that's true
[1:30:04] amen if we could only believe
[1:30:06] god help us believe all that the prophet
[1:30:08] was told if you can get the people to
[1:30:10] believe nothing will stand before your
[1:30:12] prayer not even cancer
[1:30:13] right what is it believe jesus said if
[1:30:16] thou canst believe all things are
[1:30:18] possible
[1:30:19] all things according to the word that's
[1:30:20] for sure amen
[1:30:22] look at this in mark 9 this is the
[1:30:24] father of the boy that had an epilep
[1:30:26] that had epilepsy remember and jesus
[1:30:28] said to the father he said to him if
[1:30:29] thou canst believe all things are
[1:30:31] possible to him that believeth and
[1:30:33] straightway the father of the child
[1:30:35] cried out and said with tears lord i
[1:30:37] believe
[1:30:38] by love is honesty there he said help my
[1:30:41] unbelief
[1:30:42] this is a great thing you're asking of
[1:30:44] me god lord i believe i'm confessing i
[1:30:46] believe but lord if there's anything
[1:30:48] within me that's not
[1:30:50] help me help me to put that out help me
[1:30:52] to press forward amen in faith
[1:30:55] amen we're in a special place brothers
[1:30:57] and sisters we're in a special time
[1:30:59] we're not called to shrink away from the
[1:31:01] challenges that we face in life we're
[1:31:03] not called to shrink away from the
[1:31:04] promises of the word but rather we're
[1:31:06] called to press forward in faith under
[1:31:08] the inspiration of the holy spirit to
[1:31:11] take the promises of a word into our
[1:31:13] individual lives amen
[1:31:16] hebrews 11's the faith chapter
[1:31:19] and here this is after speaking of all
[1:31:21] the great heroes of the faith
[1:31:23] okay all the ones that did the great
[1:31:25] things that we read about in scripture
[1:31:27] and we say i only want to be like them
[1:31:29] yeah
[1:31:29] if only i could have their faith listen
[1:31:31] to this it says and these all having
[1:31:34] obtained a good report through faith
[1:31:36] received not the promise
[1:31:39] god having provided some better thing
[1:31:42] for who god having provided some better
[1:31:45] thing for us
[1:31:47] that they without us should not be made
[1:31:51] perfect he's given us a better thing
[1:31:53] than all of those have
[1:31:55] they didn't have the baptism of the holy
[1:31:57] spirit they could not it wasn't given
[1:31:59] they were under the the blood of lambs
[1:32:01] and goats
[1:32:02] right they were just kicking the sink
[1:32:03] can down the road every year but christ
[1:32:05] comes and he erases the sin dead and all
[1:32:07] of a sudden he makes it possible for god
[1:32:09] to now dwell in a man
[1:32:11] and he says what he's provided some
[1:32:13] better thing for us so they did it
[1:32:14] without the holy ghost what can you do
[1:32:16] with the holy ghost what can you do with
[1:32:18] the very life of god inside of you
[1:32:20] quickening you giving you what he's
[1:32:22] promised laying it before you showing
[1:32:25] you what's for you
[1:32:26] what is there that can stop us
[1:32:28] what is there that can hold us back he
[1:32:29] says you've got what a better thing than
[1:32:31] they ever had
[1:32:33] so what is there that can hold us back
[1:32:36] what held them back
[1:32:38] nothing held them back
[1:32:40] when they had faith nothing held them
[1:32:41] back that's the same thing for us when
[1:32:43] we step out in faith amen when we step
[1:32:46] out with this better thing that he's
[1:32:47] given us there's nothing that can hold
[1:32:49] us back
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:52] god has placed his very life
[1:32:54] his very mind his very character his
[1:32:57] very desires his very wisdom inside of
[1:33:00] us
[1:33:01] david david faced all this frustration
[1:33:04] because he'd say i've got a desire but i
[1:33:06] lack
[1:33:07] something to keep me tight to it
[1:33:09] you know he lost the joy of his
[1:33:10] salvation then he he cheats with
[1:33:12] bathsheba and then he kills her husband
[1:33:14] and then he does this and he does that
[1:33:15] and he's like ah
[1:33:18] we don't have to do ah
[1:33:21] because we've got what he didn't have
[1:33:23] we've got what he was seeking
[1:33:25] right within our lives
[1:33:28] let's stand together if we would
[1:33:30] i want you to think of that idea god has
[1:33:32] placed his very life
[1:33:34] inside of me his very power his very
[1:33:36] quickening power
[1:33:38] inside of my inside of me
[1:33:43] now there's a battle you face with the
[1:33:44] flesh every day and we know that
[1:33:47] amen but the power that he has placed
[1:33:49] within us by his spirit is there to
[1:33:51] restore us back to that eden condition
[1:33:53] amen to give us every promise every
[1:33:56] redemptive blessing
