presence this morning Lord that you would speak to hearts and souls Lord that as you've healed those in the past so you'll heal them today Lord as you've saved those in the past you'll save them today and as you filled them with the Holy Spirit in the past Lord so you will today because you are unchanging Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever so Lord we're asking you to have your way Lord bless the service Bless the people gathered here today Lord lord they're here to hear you speak Lord move me aside Lord that you would touch the hearts souls and lives amongst us in Jesus Christ's name we ask and pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Genesis chapter 1 amen good to be in the house of the Lord with working heating system I was talking to my dad and he's in Edmonton and yesterday it was or day before yesterday it was minus 43 C that's not with the wind chill that's the actual air temperature so I told them it was 3° here and I could see green grass and I was going golfing and wearing a t-shirt now I wasn't doing those things but I could see grass and it was mostly green and he said he hated me so but we're glad to be here amen it's good to be here in the presence of God greet our visitors this morning God bless you each one talking with brother Joel and sister Priscilla they finally made it to Arizona after two days and Luggage was missing and rafie peed on him and you know they just it was it was quite a trip I said you were lucky you got out Thursday cuz Friday they shut the the airport down to a bomb scare so who knows when they'd have gotten out but anyways they made it there he says they're basking in the 17° and sunshine so just trusting God will bless them now that they're finally there amen God bless you this morning we're going to read in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them now here's their job description be fruit and multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen God bless you you can have your seats and just in in seeking leadership for this service this week and I feels very Sovereign and I was thinking on things and then you know just kind of putting things to paper and then I'd have a conversation with one and then I'd have a conversation with another and this is kind of just where it came out so I'm trusting the leading of the Lord this morning amen I want to take a bit of a different angle than what we've been speaking on recently we've been talking about the Holy Spirit and the attributes and the nature of the the Holy Spirit and we know that that's the very life of God it's the nature of God it's it's the character of God and we know that's been given to every Christian every true son and daughter of God has to have the Holy Ghost Inside of them amen because it's the Difference Maker it's the Difference Maker between a professing Christian and a living Christian amen it's the life that's behind us that makes us live the life we do amen there's nothing in me that can make me live this life according to the word of God I'll fail every single time but it's the power of the holy spirit in us that allows us to do these things but out of all this I want to speak this morning on a title of the broken image amen the broken image and we know that as we read here in Genesis 1 that God made Mankind in a state of perfection he put him in a perfect place and there was no sin there we were Immortal we had full Authority and the winds and the the waves could obey us like it did Christ we have full Dominion we were sons of God God and Daughters of God just as Christ was Adam and Eve were of course as we're we're talking about these things and there was no sin there was no pain there was no sickness there was no unbelief there was no fear there was no separation there was nothing there it was a perfect place today and yet we look at where we're at today and obviously something has changed amen because all of those things that were good are gone and all of the things that are bad that they never had have come in here and we know that that's because there was a battle that raged back then and it's going on today and it's for control of the lives and The Souls of man kind amen and it's between good and evil it's between God and Satan and God sent and he still sends his word to keep us right that's the only thing that God promised was his word to keep us right he said I sent my word and I healed thy diseases when he was talking to Israel he said if you'll stay in my word then I'll stay with you if you'll stay in my word then you'll get the blessings of my word but if you go against it then all the curses of it will fall upon you as well amen so he sends the word to us and he says take it or leave it and that's the choice we make amen is will we take it or we leave it now we know that if you're a true son or daughter of God you cannot be lost because you come from God and you go back to God and we'll we'll maybe touch on that a little bit later but you're a part of God and so God will bring us to the place where we decide and we make the right decision and whether he has to lay us on our back in a hospital whether he has to take things from us or whether he has to show us the graciousness of the supernal by healing by provision whatever it might be God will bring us to a place where we recognize that our place is with him amen but I want to see what this image of of mankind is supposed to look like and how it got broken and and how God is restoring it and if we turn to Genesis chapter 2 it says this it says and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it so there's his job within the context of what he said earlier amen so he's supposed to prepare Eden he's supposed to turn it into Perfection it says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat it for in the day that thou eatest thereof you shall surely die so God gives his word he tells him what to do and he tells him what not to do and he says if you do what I say everything will stay the same and if you refuse to do what I say if you disobey and do which I tell you not to do then something's going to happen and it's something horrible now here's the thing they wouldn't even know what death meant back then because they're in a state of perfection there was no understanding of what death meant but they knew that God said not to do it and that ought to have been enough amen we know that death means separation from God and eternal life means you're in the presence of God CU he is eternal life amen God only gave mankind one do not he gave him lots of dues and he gave him only one do not and he said to be to be fruitful to multiply to replenish the Earth to subdue it to have dominion over the animals and I think it's interesting that if they had focused more on what he said to do then they wouldn't have had a problem with the do Nots amen we look today and we've been told what to do with our lives we're to we're to spread the gospel we're to to seek after the king of kingdom of God to seek after the things that God wants us to do and if we consume ourselves with that then the do Nots become a lot less of a problem don't they because we're too busy doing what we're supposed to for Satan to come in and get a wedge in our life and try and draw us away from God CU Eve gets in trouble when she starts doing when she stops doing what she's supposed to be doing what did she do she started talking to the serpent as an equal the serpent was not like snakes are today because God cursed them and he said you're going to have to go on your belly he was like a man he could speak he had arms and legs he was the closest thing to a man if you're looking for the missing link it is Satan in the serpent amen that was the missing link between man and everything else it was one that was so close he could Converse but he had no soul and he was a beast and what happened is he struck up a conversation with Eve and she treated him as an equal instead of saying you're under my Dominion and what she did is she allowed him to get close to her and all of a sudden he starts talking to her and he starts asking her about the word of God gets into a conversation and pretty soon he's got her tricked amen Eve should have been using her Authority and Dominion to put him aside and say no no no you don't talk to me you know nothing about the word of God the word of God wasn't given to you no more than a parakeet could talk to us today they have no understanding of who we are that animal should have been under her submission amen as as the wife of Adam but yet she continued to talk to him amen and we see there that when she got into a conversation with him something breaks because she listens to what he has to say instead of the word of God in Genesis 3 it says this it says now the serpent was more subtle that means he was more crafty he was more SL Sly he was shrewd he was more of that than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman has God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die everything's good to this point but watch verse four it says the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die God says you shall surely die and he says Thou shalt not it's 180 degrees it's a total opposite to what the word says amen and one word changed caused the entire downfall of humanity one change from what God Said Amen it swapped the truth for a supposedly greater plane of existence because what he says in verse 5 he says for God does know that in the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you shall be as God's knowing go knowing good from Evil watch the subtlety now this is Satan's Hallmark Satan doesn't come up and punch you between the eyes Satan tries to slide a little bit here and a little bit there so in the hope that you won't understand you won't realize when what's going on and he's saying God's holding back on you there's a good thing available here and God's holding back on you because if you do this you'll be just like him and he doesn't want anybody to be like him God doesn't want to have an equal God doesn't want to have somebody that knows as much as he does so he's saying don't touch this and God has it in God has a selfish interest in keeping you from it now I want you to understand here nothing that the serpent says here is technically wrong God did know that when they ate of it their eyes would be open and they would know good from evil but that's not a good thing that's why God said don't do it you don't want to know good from Evil you don't want to experience what comes behind this amen it's not a state that they were supposed to be in and they knew no sin there was no unbelief there amen the word of God was pure and as long as they were in obedience to it then they could be pure as well but Satan has prefaced this whole thing with the lie and that's that you shall not die the effects are exactly right except for that thou shalt not die part and amen what is it he gave them 99% truth and 1% lie and a person that gives you 1% lie is still a liar no matter how much truth is there listen to this quote it says now we remember that that by this Holy Spirit we are brought into the body of Christ and we're free from the judgments of God we cannot come into judgment after you are in Christ because Christ took the Judgment for you he stood in the place just like Adam he says now Adam was not deceived he knew exactly what he was doing why did he do it to stay with Eve because she came out of him he said but Eve was deceived she thought that what she was doing was right she was deceived but she thought she was doing the right thing Satan gave her about 95% pure gospel and the other 5% was enough to throw that off he said so we've got not to be we've got to be not just park gospel we've got to be Full Gospel amen we've got to have the entire word he says for the Antichrist is this a part gospel preacher he says we know that and his works are part gospel remember what the Apostle Paul says I have not what uh shunn to declare unto you the Full Gospel we don't hold back just because it might offend or it might hurt we speak in love always because we want everyone to come to Christ we want everyone to experience what it means to be in Christ to have the baptism of the Holy Spirit to live an overcoming life amen but we don't hold back because people might not like it we have to speak the truth we do it to our children all the time don't we hopefully we do we tell them things they don't want to hear but we tell them it for their good because we're trying to teach them how to live a life amen that won't bring them into pain and suffering that they don't have to go into but listen what happens now because this is Eve's experience of Disobedience to the word of God I want you to catch what's happening here it says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat Eve saw that the tree was good but that did not make the tree good her sight her experience her five senses her feelings saying this is good did not make it good God had already said it's evil don't touch it so her experience of pleasure did not make it right what she felt in her heart was good did not make it right amen God said it wasn't good and that's where the only truth is we can say all day long it feels good it feels right this is the way I feel but if it's against the word of God it can never be right ever ever ever God cannot deny his word amen when she did this it made her feel all sorts of things she enjoyed her moment of disobedience it was pleasurable scripture says that that that that that the that sin is pleasurable for a season we're not denying that sin can feel good but it's a feel good that doesn't last amen she enjoy breaking the word of God in the moment amen but what happens is after a while something changes but in the moment nothing happened she didn't experience this death God was talking about everything supposedly remain the same people do things all the time and when the Judgment Hammer Of God doesn't come down they say Well it must have been okay but remember the wages of sin is death amen it's destruction and just because it doesn't happen immediately doesn't mean it's not going to happen amen there's a cause and effect for everything look at verse seven now it says and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons that's quite a response to eating fruit now I'm not going to go into original sin this morning but I want to ask you a question if Eve ate a fruit why did she know she was naked and if the mouth is what caused the problem then why is she covering something other than her mouth right this wasn't an apple or a peach because the only thing that we were denied access to was the tree of life we were never denied access to the tree access to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so if that was a tree we ought to be able to find it today but we can amen but Watch What Happens now watch we start to see the effect and the effect is shame and shame and fear will keep you out of the presence of God verse eight says they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God God would come down in the cool of the evening every day and spend time with them that was their experience that was eternal life that was the tree of life was God himself and they would spend time with them and they loved that and all of a sudden the thing that they love they're scared of and they're hiding from that which can save them it says and they hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden with such a with such a knowledge if it was so good and it was so right they should have been running to God saying look at what we've got look at what we've experienced but instead they're hiding and they're trying to cover what they've done because they know now that they aren't fit to be in the presence of God the only new understanding they have is now I'm not worthy what a horrible place to be they went from perfect with no sin no shame and now they don't even want to be in the presence of God verse N9 says and the Lord God called unto Adam we can give me the next slide brother Matt and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where are thou and he said I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid why because I was naked and I hid myself Adam had never experienced fear until now why because he's living in perfect love the scripture says perfect love casts out all fear Adam is experiencing his heart racing and his palms sweating and things just not feeling right a turmoil in his stomach because for once in his life now he is not fit to be in the presence of God and he's worried about how to fix it amen and he said God said ' who told you you were naked hast thou eaten of the tree that I commanded you that you shouldn't eat and the man saidthe woman who thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat the very fabric of the family of God is falling apart as fingers start to point at the next one down the line nobody's willing to stand up and say I did wrong the first place we have to recognize is our role in any of this amen I can't pass it off to my wife I can't pass off to my children I can't pass it up to my daddy and Mom I can't pass it on to the minister it's me and me alone that takes responsibility for how I live my life amen my decisions amen we know what happened after that we know that God pushed them out of his presence and he put a flaming angels with a flaming sword there to keep the way of life lest the people could come and have eternal life but before they leave God says stop and he gives them hope and he says here I will put enity between thee and the woman he's speaking to the serpent and between thy seed and her seed it'll bruise your head and it will and thou shalt bruise his heel now we know as Believers we've been well taught that this promise was fulfilled in Christ not just in his birth but in his death amen without going into the original sin though why did God have to be born of a virgin what does virginity have to do with anything why is it that Christ had to be born the way he did because he was drawing a line between what we are and what we were supposed to be our our our our nature our very flesh has fallen from the beginning and there was no redeeming quality in itself there was nothing God could do with what we had so he had to come as Adam was by a spoken word birth Perfect by the spirit of God speaking him into existence so that he could come forth perfect amen God said I'm going to draw a line between what you are and what you're supposed to be I'm going to un do the effects of all of this and it's going to be in a special way now Christ was came and he was born of a virgin it was perfect remember the scripture says Mary was not in a relationship with the man it says she was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and the angel said what's found in you is of the Holy Spirit not of Mary there was no DNA of Mary in Jesus she had nothing to do with it everything inside of her was spoken by the word of God and the Holy Spirit placed it inside of her and so when Christ was born he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was the second Adam perfect born by the word of God Jesus never called Mary Mother he called her woman Joseph was never acknowledged as his father he said don't you know that I must be about my father's business that wasn't carpentry it was the Gospel it was the good news and all of these things the scripture calls him the second Adam because he had no flaw and no fault nothing in him was was broken and that's what we needed because we had to have a second Adam that would come the difference between Christ and Adam was Christ never fell Christ never went away from the word instead he fulfilled the word that he could redeem the bride that he could redeem his children back to him amen and he came and he died on Calvary and he became our sin you know it's taught so often that that he took our sins he carried them he didn't carry them he literally became them he became you and and I so that we could become him amen Paul said in 2 Corinthians he says for he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin he took everything wrong that we were and he put it into Christ when he went to the whipping post when he went to that that cross why did he do it that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so we have a supernatural swap going on where everything wrong with us he puts on Christ and everything that's right with Christ he puts on us and so we get all the benefit and he pays all the price that's a deal I'm willing to take church that I don't have to pay the price because he already pray it amen listen to this it says but man was put here with a dominion over the Earth he had everything under his control what Adam lost Jesus proved that he had restored he stopped nature he raised the dead he did everything he says and the world is groaning today the Bible said for the manifestations of the sons of God just like Christ what for God to get into his children again in what realities realities not just Doctrine not just theology not just our name on a book but the reality of a living God inside of us amen he says and it's to make things real and then he says but it stumbles the people why because they believed a different lie they believed a different word they don't have the fullness of it amen the image of God was broken in men when Eve and Adam fell the image was broken and there was nothing in it that was worth saving but yet Christ came and he says I'll save it I'll take everything that's broken and I'll take it on me and I'll pay the price the price was death that's what we deserve the price that we deserve for our fallen condition is death according to the word of God but he says I'll pay the price I'll take my perfection and give it to them I'll take their place and I'll pay that price and it's to do what to bring us back to our original condition but I want to dig into what happened with Eve because I want to take us to where we are today we don't just want to talk about the past but we want to talk about the effect of what God has done in our lives amen because if we don't step into full Redemption we're going to miss out on what God's trying to do amen the world preaches a Christ of salvation but how many are preaching a Christ of full Redemption redeem means to restore back to its original place to take us back to what we were in Eden that's what God's trying to do he's not just trying to get our names on a book He's not just trying to tell us our sins are forgiven he's trying to restore us in our life in our condition back to what we were inside of Eden now remember Eve's mind and her five senses all declared that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was good Pleasant and enjoyable her experience was that a pleasure she thought that she was doing the right thing she had a good time and we tend to think today if we have a good time it must be right but nothing could be further from the truth amen but her experience and her opinion of pleasure did not change the fact that God said this is wrong that's where our standard is that's where our absolute is is not in how I feel not in how I think not in my intuition but it's what does the word of God say about it what has God said about it because only God is good only God knows what is right and only God knows what is wrong he is the definition of it he's the definition of it amen God said it was wrong and in the end the word proved right and her experience proved wrong her experience of pleasure didn't last but the word of God didn't fail and what happened death came after it what did she do she laid aside the word of God and she followed her senses she followed her mind she followed her intuition however we want to put it amen she entered into fellowship with an unbeliever and it led her down a path of unbelief until she would believe a lie and she would be damned by that very thing how'd she do it she got out from under God's protection listen to this always when God provides brother Matt you're going to have to help me here it's a having some issues with the clicker always when God provides he provides the best that means it works and it works all the time every time when God provided a way to fortify his church he provided the best when he gave Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden what he gave them was his word you stay behind this word and you're safe but if you get out from it the day you eat thereof is the day you die God has never changed his strategy and Satan has never changed his how he got into Adam and Eve he gets into them today why by trying to reason it out everyone today wants to have a debate and they want to have an argument that's the way it is social media is full of it the news is full of it the commentators are full of it everything is controversial and everything's up for discussion and there are no absolutes that's not the way a Believer believes that's not the way we look at the word of God Amen and listen to what they say now it's reasonable that God would not oh God has said told Satan but surely a holy God won't do this surely you won't die he say surely he will because he said he would God can't lie he's not a man that he should lie the scripture says if God says he's going to do it he's going to do it and if God says he won't do it then he won't do it but Satan tries to interject something with our feelings with the logic that God surely would not do something CU God is not that type of a person God's already declared who he is he's already declared what he likes and he's already declared what he hates and he'll stand behind that until everything's finished up amen now I had a video recommended to me on YouTube recently and it was by some actor that's on a Big Show and he's a professing Christian he has his own YouTube channel where he talks about God and His beliefs and what's happening in his life and the title of the video was some say I can't be a Christian and play this role as an actor in this big TV show amen now remember we're talking about the broken image this morning and this is what it looks like I as soon as I read that title I knew it was going to be a doozy but I wanted to hear his logic because I knew logic was going to come through but I want to repeat some of his words because I want you to see what a broken image looks like today he said I love playing this character I love telling this story he has pleasure in it I love playing a character who creates a kind of moral ambiguity that we should struggle against as we consider whether or not what he's doing is good all the time or morally right I think that kind of thing is fun and fascinating and I think escaping to that world as an audience I hope it's as enjoyable for you as it is for me to bring it to life moral ambiguity he says but it's funny to me how a lot of people criticize me supposed Christians especially for playing this character as if the only TV that should exist is people silently folding their hands in the Pew of a church I mean what kind of a story are we supposed to be telling maybe we could start with the gospel there's only one thing Jesus told us to go out and do preach the gospel he didn't say tell stories he said preach the gospel in word and In Deed we've got Mark 16 that tells us if we're going to do TV that's the kind of TV we ought to do the gospel amen but I've said this before don't answer satanic questions with satanic answers and his answer is well if that won't sell then that means we've got to do something else no if that won't sell and we have to compromise on anything else then maybe we don't need to do it at all now maybe we don't have to do it at all amen but you look at that show The Chosen seems to be doing just fine where they focus on the gospel but what's the simple Le fact he takes pleasure in what he's doing and that's his bottom line I take pleasure in it I call myself a Christian therefore it's okay we're not here to sell we're here to offer free of charge we've received freely we give freely amen we're not here to make money off the gospel we're not here to make money off of the gifts God gives us we're here to bring souls to Christ so he continues he says I think it's laughable when people criticize me for playing people that aren't saintly that's not my job so in his mind we don't have to be saintly we can be morally ambiguous to make people think he says and I don't think God only cares about telling those kinds of stories now he presumes to think for God Amen God gave us a story to tell Mark 16 that's it the story we have to tell is what he's done and what he's doing amen we give our testimony for what the gospel looks like today amen our job is to live the life of Christ not just talk it it's to live it amen and it's to bring people up to his level not stoop at their level amen we don't look down at somebody that's not a Believer but that means we don't get in the mud either I don't become a drunk to save a drunk I don't become a fornicator to save a fornicator I don't become a liar to save a liar I say there's a higher plane there's a way that you can live there where you don't have to be that way he says I think we can start conversations and Reach people through these mediums in a way that I think God enjoys does God enjoy moral ambiguity scripture says that you're yay be yay and you're NB nay scripture says that these things are plain the way of Holiness is is so easy to follow that a man though a fool could still walk in it God's not trying to hide things from people so why do we need moral ambiguity he says in a way that I think God is enjoys he says so here we are now where we can get to the heart of the matter where God has built a platform because of this show for me where I can reach people who maybe don't think about these things all the time and maybe maybe for those who are struggling or feel lost and want to try something new they can find something that brings them hope like my faith has to me but I want you to catch what he says here I think I think I think I don't think Where's God he doesn't mention a sing Le scripture he doesn't take his thoughts back to the word of God he just says I think because he's enjoying what he's doing and because he enjoys it and he thinks that there's something of God in it that makes it right and good amen but the scripture says God doesn't dwell in darkness there's no darkness in him there's no evil in him there's no moral ambiguity God doesn't preach through sin God doesn't preach through going against his word amen God doesn't contradict his word with his blessings it doesn't work that way you can't say I'm doing what the word says not to do and God's in it no that's not the way God does it God can turn it for good but he's not in it amen so we can see that these man's contradictions are obvious but yet we come to our own lives and we can say well I feel led to do this and it takes you right out of the word of God and what do we fall back on what we feel I think I feel led is the the great thing that I hear so many times but your leadership has to come in line with the word of God otherwise it's your own leadership it's not God it's never God if it's contrary to his word amen God never blesses us in a way that makes us go against his word he doesn't do it he can't do it because it would mean he's going against himself amen now this this man this actor is extremely passionate about God when you watch him he's eager his eyes are bright and Shining he's passionate he's Fearless he loves to talk about God but that has nothing to do with it I went and looked up his show and his show is rated to be 18 plus years old to watch it it has sex and nudity profanity alcohol drugs and smoking intense violence and Gore and taking the name of God in vain in it and he does those things personally in those in in the show or whatever it is so he is doing things that Paul said are not even to be named Among Us they're not even to be spoken of and he is doing them in front of millions of people and saying this is the platform God has built so that I can share the gospel what's his testimony on the screen I'm like all of you and what's his testimony off the screen I'm not like all of you you can't get clear water and dirty water out of the same Fountain you can't do it there's a disconnect here and the disconnect is is that he's not running his filter through the word of God man there's nothing there this man has nothing of God in his in his show you can look it up and they'll they'll give you all the things that they do and say and warnings and all these different things they have websites for these things there's no references to Christ except to take his name in vain in the show that's it no spirituality no faith no nothing like he says it's a morally ambiguous show about a man that goes around writing wrongs and he says this is God using me building a platform he said God's blessing my work by making me famous enough so people will listen to me about the gospel doesn't that sound good that's what we want to do isn't it God has given me this God has given me that God's done this and that so I can do something for his glory but if what he's given you is contrary to his word it can't be him Paul said this in Romans 3:8 he said and why not say he said as some slanderously report claim that we teach let us do evil so that may good may come of it that's literally what this man is saying I'm going to do something that is wrong and God is using me to do something good out of it Paul says their condemnation by God is just God will judge them for it because it's in their own minds it's in their own life it's in their own Pleasures that they're doing it and God is nowhere found in it now you say brother John this is too obvious he's obviously a professing Christian he's not a real Christian but there were over 6,100 comments on that video from professing Christians saying you're absolutely right how how have we slid this far how does somebody get that far it's because they've been fed alive for so long that they finally believe it amen they believe you can do anything and be a Christian but what does Christian mean see it's lost its meaning Church it means Christlike like Christ Christ was a holy person he wasn't running around doing anything and everything he kept his life holy he kept his like Sanctified scripture tells us to be holy as God is Holy this man has no concept of Holiness and so he'll sit there and he'll say God is using me amen but what's the problem here he's not feeding on the full word he's going here a bit and there a bit and he's building a web out of scriptures that supports his IDE somehow I'm still not sure because I don't know how you can go and and have nudity and all these different things and somehow think that God's in it but yet he does 2 Thessalonians 2 says this this is Paul talking he says for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie now watch why he lets them believe it because that they all might be damned who believe not the truth why had pleasure in unrighteousness God says if this is what you like I'll give you over so completely that you'll believe your own self even though it's absolutely contrary to what I've told you you love it so much I don't have to do anything I'll just let you have it church if we insist on our way you know what God does have your way do it and what happens is we get scars and it's not scars of his choosing it's not scars of his making it scars of our making by our choices amen when we walk off from the word of God you know what God does he says I'm going to stay right here and you can come back anytime the scariest thing is if nothing happens scari thing is if nothing happens we do things we know we ought not to do and nothing happens you know why because the scripture says that God chastises his children and if he doesn't chastise us it means we're not his children says we're bastards amen child of God gets off the word of God they know they're off the word of God they do it willingly in iniquity God will beat them he'll spank them he'll get their attention one way or the other and he'll bring them back to the word because that's the way God works with his children he doesn't deal in moral ambiguity he deals with sharp correction to bring us back to his presence and to his word amen what happened in the Garden of Eden was Satan took the mind and God took the heart and Eve allowed the mind to override the word of God that was in her heart logic and reason surely God won't do it prophet of God say he surely will cuz he said he would and he can't take it back what's the problem we're made in the image of God but the image is broken because we have our mind now we have our spirit now and that's what breaks it we're in His image we're meant to be creators we're meant to have dominion but what we have now is a mind of our own making and it's subject to satanic influence and so everything we do instead of being creative is destructive amen we're born in sin we're shaped in iniquity we come to the world speaking lies there is nothing of the purity of the original creation that we had in us anymore we have a presumption of our own goodness of our own correctness and usually it's with a minimal interaction with God it's not a real relationship it's just a little thing we have and so we tend to overstate the goodness that's in us people say people are good scripture says we're not word says there's nothing good in us we have moments where we can sacrifice absolutely but our overall nature is destructive because in the end we are selfish we're internally focused amen look at what the prophet of God says he says first we reckon ourselves wor Sinners and worthy of condemnation that's where we start we're unworthy nothing we have we can't bring anything to the table that's good he says we're all born in sin we're shaped in iniquity there's not a sound parcel of us our minds are bad our soul is corruptable our constant thinking is evil every imaginary thought of a man's mind is evil he's a sinner and also our body is weak our spirit is no good and we're just full of corruption that's what we are that's all we are he says and how could one corruptible thing bring forth another good thing out of a corruptible let me say this that in job the 14th chapter he said seeing that man is born of a woman full of sorrow and trouble yet he comes forth like a flower and he Fades away and on as the prophet goes on speaking he says who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean thing not one he says there's no purification to it our mind our soul our spirit is completely corrupt by our natural birth there's nothing good that we're bringing to this amen but what brings us into a Godly life is that Christ died for our sins he became our sins and we can accept that free gift it's a free gift you don't have to pay anything to accept the the work of Christ the calvary except to repent of where you're at to repent of what you're done sincere repentance for what you've been and what you've done and you accept his work at Calvary and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from our sins that is very simple amen but the Redemptive Act of Act of Calvary is only the start it's only the start amen the price of sin is paid but for the believer that's just the foundation for everything that we are why because our nature isn't Changed by Calvary our spirit isn't Changed by Calvary our heart isn't Changed by Calvary amen the only thing that Calvary changes is that we can approach God cuz when Christ died remember they had the holy of holies and the Temple and that's where the glory of God was that's where the Ark of the Covenant was that's where the word of God was that's where the presence of God was and when Christ died the the the veil was torn from top to bottom showing that God tore it and he tore it open so that anybody could come you don't have to come as a good person you can come as the dirtiest person in this world and you can walk straight into the presence of God and say I'm sorry and I want forgiveness and he will forgive you and he'll save you you never did it in the first place he'll justify you amen but that doesn't restore us to our eating condition it just is the doorway to the path to being restored to our Eden condition it takes more than forgiveness it takes a changing of Our Lives takes a changing of our heart it takes a changing of our soul a changing of our spirit not just the cleansing of our conscience because Calvary cleanses the conscience amen but unless we change our our heart and our soul our spirit we're still stuck with what we think and feel is right and it'll lead us right back to where we were before amen our nature is self- deceiving why because it's subject to sin it's born in sin and therefore it's more inclined towards being influenced by Satan than God that's our natural condition Jeremiah said this he says the heart is deceitful above all things you say I feel like this is right I feel like that is right I feel like I should do this I feel like I should do that I feel like that makes sense that has nothing to do with it he says our heart is the most deceitful thing in the world he says it's desperately wicked and who can know it you say in my heart it feels right I say who cares what does the word of God say and I've got to check that in myself every day because feelings rise up to do to not do to speak to not speak to act to not act we've got to come back to hear because that's what the spirit of God will do in our lives Isaiah 5 says this woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put Darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter woe unto them now catch this that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight this actor is wise in his own eyes he's saying God gave me Fame so I could be a witness the deceit here is that God gave him Fame he has Fame that doesn't mean God gave it to him that doesn't mean that's the work of God Amen because why he's living contrary to the word of God in those very films and so God can't use him in that way you know what God could do God could open his eyes and that man could repent of where he's at and come into a revelation not just of a saving God but a changing God and that's how God could use where he's at but God can't use him where he's at because he's living and acting in sin and taking pleasure in it he hasn't even understood what it means to repent yet unfortunately and I'm not saying that in judgment I'm saying that that God would be merciful to him and open his eyes because there's 6,100 other people that are right there with them and it's the blind leading the blind and when the blind lead the blind they both fall into the ditch there's no hope for them amen unless God would come he needs to experience Christ as Lord not just as Savior amen but Christianity Today is satisfied with salvation but they don't want full Redemption because full Redemption means we've got to die out and we've got to let go of our self-control amen we've got to let go of our self-will and we've got to say Lord I'll let you lead my life I'll do what you want me to do rather than what I want to do Paul would warn of what was coming and he would he would talk about the end times and I want you to consider as I read the first four verses here what kind of people we're talking about Paul says this he says this know also that in the last days church we in the last days it's the end of the end we're this close to it all being over that in the last days perilous times shall come dangerous times difficult times he says for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers to call that which is of god not of God and to call that which is not of God to be of God they'll swap around what it means to be of God he says there'll be disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false false accusers incontinent now we have a different meaning for incontinent today incontinent here you know what it means morally ambiguous the very thing that this man said God loves he says this is what they're going to be morally ambiguous this is not the nature of God he says they'll be fierce always fighting always getting riled up always on a cause despisers of those that are good they find it laughable with supposed Christians think he says they'll be traitors heady high-minded that word high-m minded means inflated with self-conceit and they'll be lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God now I read all of that and I'm going to ask a question don't answer it answer it in your head who are the people he's talking about here oh we go right to our unsaved co-workers or or atheists or or obvious Sinners right people of this world that don't know Christ that's where our that's where our mind would go isn't it but we read verse 5 and it says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away these are believers professing Christians here a form of godliness they've got something but it's not the whole thing it's not the real thing it says but they deny the power thereof it says turn away from them be separate from them don't spend your time with them you want a perfect example of this it was Lot remember Abraham's nephew lot they came to a place where they had so much that their people were fighting and so Abraham said let's not fight you pick where you want to live and I'll take whatever you don't want and so L looked toward the wellwater PLS of of Sodom and Gomorrah and he saw that there was lots of food and lots of pasture lots of wealth there was a walled City there and he says I'm going to take that and the scripture says that lot goes to Sodom and the actions of Sodom vexed his righteous soul but you know what it didn't Vex it enough to make him leave why a form of godliness but not willing to have the whole thing he was it was uncomfortable for him but he was willing to put up with it for the what the pleasures that he got there for the safety for the Assurance for the wealth that brought him for the influence he was a man in the gate he was one of the city officials he rose up in politics he made a name for himself by compromise so these people have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof amen there are people that go to church they're preachers they're professing Christians they're people associated with the Bible they have a godliness of sorts they have a profession of sorts they Proclaim an experience of Christ but they don't have what the word says they're supposed to have they don't live by the word they have a little experience but they still have a lot of self amen they have a religious spirit but they don't have overcoming power in their day-to-day Life to Live what the word says we're supposed to live that's what it says they deny the power thereof and what is the denying the power thereof they say the Holy Ghost is not what it was it was only for the disciples it was only for the apostles well that's a lie cuz there was 120 in the upper room and they weren't all Apostles and they weren't all men and they weren't all preachers there there was women up there too there were men that weren't preachers the holy spirit is for everyone but they say they deny the power thereof it doesn't have the same effect it used to amen and what happens is they can't live above sin they can't live above the world they can't live above self they can't be led by God because they're still stuck in themselves amen they talk a lot but their life doesn't reflect the power of the Living Word and so they're unconcerned by what's happening in their lives like I said today the word Christian has lost all meaning because anybody can be a Christian and do anything why because they have a form of godliness but they deny the power of the full word in their lives amen they deny the changing power of God by the Holy Spirit to make the word live in their own life that's what it is they eliminate the promises of God they eliminate the the supernatural they eliminate the power of God the very Prophecies of this word because they put it on another person or or another day or say it's not even in effect anymore they take the power out of the word of God they may have been Justified they may have had an experience where they repented of their sins but to repent doesn't mean to say I'm sorry it means to act sorry to change the way you're living so if you haven't changed your life since you repented you didn't repent and so there is no remission of sins where there's no repentance you're supposed to change the way you're walking you're supposed to change the way you're living not just the way you talk so where there's no repentance How can there be a remission of sins how can they truly be forgiven they're fooling themselves this man is fooling himself it says for this sort this sort of people are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women I'm not picking on women here women in the scripture represents a church this is talking about churches this is talking about people that go to church it's talking about denominations it's talking about organized religion where these men will come in and they'll deny the full power of the word they'll only preach their portion and they'll put a period behind it and God can't be in there because God is the whole word he's not just a part of the word it says they'll lead captive silly women they'll keep let lead captive they'll put in bondage people that go to church Laden with sins and led away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth it's all in their head what they have and it's either wrong or it's intellectual and it never drops down into the heart it's never quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to this quotes as we start to close down here he says now did you notice it's just like a man that says I'm going to refuse to believe that the sun is shining I won't have nothing else to do with the sun he closes his eyes and goes down in the basement of his house and says I just refuse to know the sun is shining my little son Samuel he's almost po when he wants to hide from me you know what he does you can't see me Daddy I say just because you can't see me doesn't mean I can't see you just CU you say the sun isn't shining doesn't mean the sun isn't Shin just means you can't see the sun shining he says why yet why you say that man something will be mentally wrong with him why because it's obvious the sun is shining he says well a man that will reject Jesus Christ has the same grounds the holy spirit is more real than the sunshine the sun will fail but the Holy Spirit can't fail it doesn't only light for the sense of sight but it lights for the soul a light of Glory that leads us to God that projects Calvary to us and the sufferings of the Lord Jesus the oncoming judgment and the Escape for those that want to come that's what the holy spirit's doing remember the the spirit of God is striving with man to get them to see what's coming and to help them find a way of Escape but he says I'm not always going to strive with man there's going to be a day where the door shuts just like it did on the ark there's going to be a day when the door shuts and you can pound on it all you want but judgment is open Mercy's closed he says I'd rather be totally blind physically Ally and have my spiritual sight than to be totally blind spiritually and have my physical sight I want to have spiritual sight notice what would be wrong with that man then his friends would come and say Jim or whatever his name is you're wrong come out of that old dingy basement and musty and he would stand and say I tell you I'm satisfied where I am he doesn't want the welcome Sunshine he doesn't want its healing Rays he doesn't want its beauty and its warm for his life he say something will be wrong with the man as new finlanders we know what a it's like to go without the sun don't we we all have our pasty skin this morning why because we don't get sun but when it comes out what do we do we rush outside if it's windy we get down low in our decks where the wind can't hit us and we can still enjoy the sunshine don't we we love the sun he's saying if you ever experience the Holy Spirit you'll love it too it's real it's there it's available but if you shut yourself off from opportunity you'll never get it you'll never get the benefits of it he says so is the man or woman who wants to stay in this dingy world shut up in the musty sin of unbelief and saying the days of Miracle are are passed there's no such thing as Divine Healing there is no Holy Ghost he says it's because you're refusing to come out of the must and the dens of the devil and of hell and of sin and of Pride you know it's hard to admit we've been fooled I've talked before in Texas how we had a pastor that was living a double life and it was the hardest thing to admit we'd been fooled but but it's the best thing we did because it kept us from ever getting fooled that way again why because we identified how we let him get away with it and it was because we did not compare his life to the word of God we let it go for the sake of a gift we let it go for the sake of the position and God taught me a lesson that I've never forgot and it's no matter how good the gift gift is if the life doesn't line up with the scripture get that man out of the pulpit amen you do that for me if I ever get out of line get me out out this is what we follow not a man not a gift not a Ministry I had to admit I was wrong and I had to admit I got fooled and I had to see where I got fooled so I could correct it and it's only the grace of God that that didn't burn me and cause me to get hurt and offended and walk away from it all but rather to learn the lesson and help others and teach the same thing when I had the opportunity he says finally if he doesn't get the sunlight he turns pale he gets real pale sickness sits in on him that's the M what's the matter with the world today what that's what's the matter with most of our churches today we're becoming anemic we need a blood transfusion he says we're pale because we are failing our spiritual health is failing us we don't have the Zeal no more to hunt souls to warm people to get our neighbors to get our friends the Milkman the paper boy whatever it is to get someone to the Lord Jesus we're pale we're failing to walk in the light which is our privilege if we've seen the light of the word of God if we've seen the light of the truth for this hour and we don't walk in it we are missing out on our privileges Prophet God would say we're living below our privileges that's why we read our Bible and pray every day so we can see where God is working and moving and the answers he has for our life he says we're failing to believe in the health of God by Divine Healing you can live in artificial light all your life but it won't give you what the sun gives you and in the end you'll become sicker and sicker and sicker why because we need what that son has for us how did these people get in such a condition they didn't walk in the full truth of God's word they picked and chose the scripture says that in that day they'll they'll they'll they'll draw to themselves they'll Heap they'll gather a bunch of teachers that tell them what they want to hear and if all you hear is what you want to hear how you ever going to grow how you ever going to change cuz all they'll do is Pat you on the back and say you're good you're good you're good don't worry about this don't worry about that Prosperity gospels influence gospels come to church Gospels it has nothing to do with God's trying to do amen what do they do they come and they try and accept the free portion of Calvary and they neglect the dying out to self that comes with full Redemption Amen to be born again Jesus said there has to be a death he says you've got to be born again not just accept the work of Calvary but you've got to be born again baptism doesn't make us born again it's symbolic of a process that we do in ourselves we die out we let go of the steering wheel we let go of self-control and we have to choose to do that we have to choose to say I'll let this govern my life rather than what I feel in here that means we need a nature change because our nature is resistive to the word of God prophet of God said if he ever pulls on you he says it's the greatest thing you'll ever have is when something in your heart says I want to live like that cuz not everybody gets it not everybody has it not everybody has a response inside of here amen we need to realize our mind our nature our spirit our very soul is Tainted and we need God to do a work inside of our Lives you know sometimes we look at the mess we're in and we say how can we get out of it ever been there how can God make something good out of this mess how can God get me out out of this pit how can God get me out of this bondage how can God get me out of this addiction we say it's too far gone or maybe today we say well I'm I'm doing good but we look at our kids we look at our relatives we look at loved ones we look at colleagues and say but them how is that ever going to work listen Saul was killing Christians and God turned him into the prophet for the Gentiles that's what God can do he can turn a sinner into a saint listen to this I was reading this in my devotions the other morning I underlined it and I just had a wonderful moment of worship and praise I love the way God provides he knows how to do it and his ways are so much greater than ours he it's a whole other level than what we could ever ask or think but I was reading this in Romans 5 it said more over the law entered that the offense might abound unless we have a law that says something is wrong you're never wrong unless we have a law that says you can't drive over 50 then you can drive any speed you want and you're not contrary to the law there's no offense without the law the Bible says that until the law came we couldn't be we couldn't be judged for our sin that's why Abraham could live the way he did and God could work with him the way he did the law wasn't given but as soon as Moses comes and the law is given now the people are held accountable for it so God says the law comes that sin May abound that the offense might abound so that the the the the the the wrongs can become big become obvious amen by the law we're judged and were determined to be worthy of death but listen to this but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound so that means if your sin is here God's grace is here if your sin is here God's Grace is here it doesn't matter how much sin you have it doesn't matter how big the mess is God's grace is greater than what you can mess up amen so if you're a liar if you're a cheat if you're a homosexual if you're a fornicator if you're whatever it might be God says whatever you can do I can take you out of it however bad you can get my goodness is far greater than your bad whatever you get your mess into I can untie all the knots I think it was Alexander the Great went to this place and they had this big knot was it the Georgia notot I'm not sure and they had this great knot and they said whoever undo this knot it was a prophecy that was given you know the way they do it then that that that's the great king and everybody had tried on doing that KN for a long long time you know what Alexander the Great did he came up he took a sword and went done that's it everybody was trying to do it their way he said I just need to get rid of the KN that was it that's what God does we think we can get things so knotted and so Twisted impossible to untangle and God just says done got something else for me he can do it in his sleep except he doesn't sleep it's nothing to God whatever our mess is his grace his unmar favor can top it every single time what does this Grace look like see we're we're we're powerless to change ourselves there's nothing good in us there's no Purity in us there's there's there there's no discipline that can take us to this path of righteousness and Holiness amen we're in the age of we're in the season of New Year's resolutions and 99% of them are probably broken already 14 days in we can't change ourselves we can't make ourselves better we can't make ourselves like God we can't redeem ourselves we can't bring us into his presence amen people stop with forgiveness of sins but they keep on living a life that's unchanged claiming a change but there is no change and they slip right back into it what they were always doing that's not the act of God that's not the work of God God wants to change us into the original image again he wants to take that broken image and turn it back into the original I want to show you what this Grace looks like this is the process of Grace he says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean this isn't sprinkling the Catholic Church sprinkles that's not what he's talking about Paul would say it's by the washing of Water by the word of God that's how he washes us the water the the natural water when we baptizing these things it's just a symbol of what this word is supposed to be doing that as we read it it changes Our Lives amen by the Holy Spirit grabbing onto it he says that you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you and that's justif ification that's the finished work of Calvary where the blood cleanses us from sin but watch this see that's not enough he says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and will give you a heart of Flesh a soft heart so we need a new heart because one that has to be inclined towards God our natural one's not that way amen we're hard towards God so he gives us a spirit that can get along with his Spirit an attitude a receptive a approach that God can come into because otherwise we don't want to be around God because what we're fallen in sin like Adam and Eve were ashamed we're unworthy to come into these things amen but what happens is he gives us a new heart a new spirit and now we can really become tender towards the things of God we can be tender towards the word of God and what does it do it changes our desires and it sanctifies our life it takes out all the mil all the filth all the wrong habits and all the wrong desires and addictions and all these different things and it cleans us out and then when that's done then he says and I will put my spirit within you that's the Holy Spirit and it's in your soul he says' and I will cause you to walk in my statutes in other words I'll cause you to live the way my word says to live amen it says and you shall keep my judgments and do them so it's only in in verse 27 that we can actually live the Christian walk why because it's we sang it didn't we not by might not by power not by discipline not by desire but by my spirit by the spirit of the Living God inside of us that we can live these sorts of things amen what we have today is so broken in terms of the image of God because our opinion of ourselves is so high social media has has absolutely decimated any chance of humility that people have we all think we know all things for all people and we're out there running around sniping at this shooting off at that da da da D we think so much of ourselves amen we've become a law for ourselves amen and so we become powerful in our own eyes and we've forgotten that we need a redeemer that we've fallen from Grace we've fallen from our original position amen we don't think we need changing that's the problem is we we think it's okay to be the way we are what's the world saying today in the schools be who you are no I don't care if you're the best person or the worst person it's not going to matter in the end you got to become what Christ tells us to be good bad short tall fat skinny pop unpopular acne no acne nothing has nothing to do with it addict they living the cleanest moral life it matters not it's all in sin before God Amen our entire nature is destructive in the days of Noah God said the thoughts of men are evil continually his every imagination is evil but we're creative and you look at what technology has brought us you know in Edmonton minus 43 and they can stay warm in it they can stay comfortable that's what technology has brought us but we see that technology has destroyed the Fabrics of society it breaks up families and it's destroying the planet we're on our creation is destructive why because we're in sin now we're no longer in the image of God but we know what happened on the day of Pentecost was God came back to the Believers in the form of the Holy Spirit and that was to give us power to live power to live because before that the disciples they had power to cast out Devils they had powers to heal the sick they had great revelation of who Christ was and yet they still walked away from him when the times got tough and they went back to their old way of living Peter went back to fishing naked right ashamed lost but on the day of Pentecost Peter's changed and he's never the same again and he never has that fear anymore he's got resolve he's got commitment he's got drive to do what to preach the gospel has been told to amen and what was it in the day of Pentecost it was the grace of God pouring out on the people in the form of the holy spirit that would let them live a life like Christ did that's literally what we're supposed to do Paul said this as we're closing I'm on the last page he says I am crucified with Christ oh you're dead Paul he says no nevertheless I live but yet not I but Christ lives in me now watch this the life I live in the flesh the life I live in this body the day-to-day living that I have is by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Paul says it's Christ living in me now it's not Paul it's not my desires it's not my mind it's not my my intuition but it's Christ that lives in me then he say in 2 Corinthians he says therefore If any man be in Christ in Christ then he is a new creature he's a new creation he says old things are passed away they're dead everything in my past is dead not just what I did but the way I thought the way I acted the things I loved the things I desired it's all gone he says behold all things are become new Everything's changed that's how you know when somebody has truly accepted Christ All Things become new there's a difference we can see it we can see it in our children they go from being churchgoers to Christians we can see it in our spouses we can see it in converts and that the difference that comes from just reading about it and trying to live it to being it when we're in Christ then we become him he's literally living through us then Paul would say in First Corinthians he says for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body this isn't a this isn't joining a church it's not putting your name on the roles it's not you know reciting a catechism it's not repeating quotes he says by one Spirit the Holy Spirit we're baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink by one spirit amen the only way you get into heaven as a child of God is by the holy spirit in your life that's the token that's the key that's your access that's your ticket is the holy spirit in your soul that takes you all the way to the day of your full Redemption two more quotes the M musicians can come if they would says he that heareth my words and believeth on him that hath me that sent me has present tense everlasting life and shall not come to the Judgment but is pass from Death to life he said the holy spirit is an experience of being filled and indued with power for service he says but confession and receiving Christ is to have faith and make your confession and feel free that God has forgiven you of your sins see repentance in accepting the work of Calvary sets your conscience free so you don't have to worry about that now you can set your eyes on what he has for you he's taking care of what's behind you now he gives you an opportunity to step into what he has in front of you amen your conscience is free with the finished work of Calvary but self-will is still there and that's where the dying out has to has to come in because you got to let go and let the Holy Spirit take hold of your life amen we've been set free from our past but the future is still up to us and we can only do that by letting go and letting God step into our life amen it takes the Holy Spirit to make us a new creation a new creature in Christ we die out and then we live in newness of Life by the power of the Holy Spirit he says but as many as received him we can stand as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the offsprings of God he said I give them eternal life eternal life comes from the Greek word of Zoey Zoey is that Life Zoey is the life of God he says and if the life of God is living in you it produces a Godly life just as certain as I'm standing on this platform and a man that's got it got what the life of God living in him can no more perish than God can perish because God is in the man that chokes people today because we're so used to going to church and hearing a 15minute sermon that tells us everything's okay and we've got a full word of God that says he wants to come inside of you and live to produce the very words of this Bible in your day-to-day life that he can come into your families he can come into our jobs he can come into our thoughts he can take away our desires he can break the bondage that we have the things that tie us up everything we think well i' brother John I've got the Holy Ghost been a Believer for 40 years that doesn't mean we don't have chains that need broken that doesn't mean we don't have self-will still creeping in from time to time that doesn't mean that desires don't come cuz remember Satan's a good enemy if I can say one thing about Satan is that he's a good enemy amen he knows our weaknesses he knows how to access our lives he knows our proclivities he knows what this flesh wants but remember the scripture says greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and the only way the greater is the greater is going to be in me is if it's by the holy spirit because in John klet of myself there's nothing that can defeat Satan and look at my life before Christ as much as you try and live a good life you're still letting in the rock and roll you're still looking at things you're still getting caught up in lust and all these different things it's all there the desire is there even the will but the power is not but when I gave my life to him what happened that changed in an instant a literal instant and All Things become new and the thing which you could not defeat all of a sudden the battles is over victory's won set free and now I can walk every day and then sometimes we get worned out worn down stressed out and Satan will slide something in and we trip up don't we but you know what I've got a blood that covers me and I go and I say Lord I'm sorry I'm not up here as a preacher trying to pretend I'm perfect by no means any Christian that tells you their perfect day today is a liar but through his blood we didn't do it that's the work of the grace of the blood of Jesus Christ is that it doesn't just cover our sins it erases them and that's the freedom to walk day by day the freedom to grow the freedom to mature the freedom to step into the promises of God is because my conscience doesn't bother me anymore and I can go into his presence day after day after after day after day and he can renew me and he can refresh me and he can strengthen me and he can give me what I have need of for every single day amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord your word is so rich for us Lord your thought towards us are for good and not of evil Lord to bring us to an expected end to to bring us to a sure thing and Lord yet this flesh desires control Lord it desires to do its own thing Lord It Wants What It sees It Wants What It Feels Lord but there's an answer that can come in the soul of a man or a woman and it can set them free from those things and Lord no matter where we're at this morning Lord young to old experienced or never experienced you in the first place Lord we know there's a freedom that can come Lord that there's chains that can be broken Lord that there's victories to be had Lord and it's by standing on the word of God and laying all other things aside Lord would you help us to put our faith in you Lord help us to trust you day by day help us to seek you early Lord the first thing we do let us go to your word the first thing

mark Lord we press towards the prize of the high calling in Jesus Christ Lord a changing of our bodies where we can go to be with you in eternity Lord I pray your Holy Spirit would fill us even again
