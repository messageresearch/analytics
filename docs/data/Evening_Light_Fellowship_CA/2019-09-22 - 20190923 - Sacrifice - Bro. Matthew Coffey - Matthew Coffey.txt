that your grace just be a pause grace to those couldn't make it father and lord I pray that you just bless us Lord with your presence we long for it Lord in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen if we could turn into our Bibles to Exodus 20 so want to take just a little thought there today on sacrifice Virgil and a lot of the other ministers have been hitting a lot different area but it's just a thought I felt to take so over in Exodus 20 would start with thee the start of the natural sacrifice X is 20 verses 20 for an altar of Earth thou shalt make unto me and shall sacrifice there on die burnt offerings and I peace offerings thy sheep and dine oxen in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee god bless the word you can be seated so don't talk about the natural sacrifice we will need to go back to the first sacrifice which is in Genesis 4 so big turn to Genesis 4 I probably keep your Bibles handy I have a few scriptures here today so Genesis four versus one is it an Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I've gotten a man from the Lord and she again know when I'm not around Scripture I think nope that's right and she again bare his brother and evil and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground an improv time it came to pass that Cain brought out of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance countenance fell this year is the first sacrifice that was made in scripture and we see here that Cain de Abel definitely had a revelation of original sin he knew that blood caused to fall and would take blood to redeem them in butter brown puts it nicely here in victory days had but Abel by spiritual revelation revealed to him that it was not the fruit of the field that caused the death it was blood that caused the death so he offered back blood of an innocent substitute and God accepted it and that has been God's propitiation for our sins ever since that very day no other way because if he had accepted on any other basis then we'd have Chaya had to come to that basis to find favor with God but God only accepted only the innocent blood of an innocent subject so we see here even in a very beginning there's very distinct line a true sacrifice back here is bloody it was messy and even in ourselves as we proceed forward and get closer to God we must also die two things and it can be messy at times and over numbers 15 and he says a few scriptures here but they're trying to set it a direction here I said in numbers fifth verse three and we'll make an offering by fire unto the Lord a burnt offering or an up sacrifice in performing a vow or in a free will offering or in your solemn feast to make a sweet savour unto the Lord of the herd of the flock and in Deuteronomy don't need to term if you want to is don't Deuteronomy 12 verse 11 then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there therefore shall you bring all that I command you your burnt offerings your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows would you vow unto God so this is pretty inclusive if God the place where he choose to dwell you should bring everything from there sacrifices to your tithes to your vows scripture is very clear especially under and on the point of vows if you make a value must keep it it must be very fervent and diligent to keep this vow but to think about what making a sacrifice in Leviticus 22 verse 29 Moses says and when you will offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving unto the Lord offer it of your own free will it has to be of an old free will you can't be doing this begrudgingly everything Christ has done for us wasn't done begrudgingly he just didn't do it out of convenience he did it out of love and it behooves us to do it any other way back to him in 1st Kings 17 and verse 36 we read here said but the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm they had no they did nothing to get out of Egypt this was all God purely God he's with great power and a stretched out arm him shall you fear and him shall you worship and to him shall you do sacrifice this is all of God even in the Old Testament under the Levitical priesthood and a mosaic lot oh it was very much still God and we need to be willing sanctified vessels to go with the will of God this has nothing to do with us if you look at Abraham I just going to paraphrase some of this in Genesis 15 18 to 21 we read of when God made the first covenant when he made a covenant with Abraham and he told Abraham you this would be your seed you will have a son and here I was like well how can I be sure so God told to go take a heifer and different Creek birds and that and you set your sacrifice up he said and I will pass through so Abraham he went he prepared to sacrifice built the altars prepared the animals caught him and to he had everything already but God didn't show up right away it says here in scripture that abraham spent a good portion of the day keeping the birds from getting at the carcasses and it wasn't till the evening time when he was wore out and tired that God caused him to fall asleep and then God passed through the sacrifice had nothing to do with Abraham it was all God that Covenant was purely God Abraham was just along for the ride he tried everything to preserve and set up the sacrifice but in the end it was God that did everything he also moved forward into Genesis 22 where he already had a son Isaac he saw the fulfillment of that covenant and then God says to him take your son and go and go off from rifice so once again abraham has to go and prepare to sacrifice only this time it's his only son he had to go through a lot of fights and trials to get to this point and now he's been asked to give it up but what's interesting is even I'm sure you're all familiar when they get to the mountain his servants asked him you're worth the sacrifice he said don't worry said I and the lad will return even then he knew that if he did sacrifice and kill his son gob was obligated to raise him up in fulfillment of that covenant so even God let him go right to the point where he he was about to kill him and he stopped him said now I know that you love me and he provided a sacrifice he still trusted right to the end there was no hesitation in Abraham and we must be like that even in ourselves when we come to God or he asked us to do something we must trust in the God who has made a covenant with us if you look in in the Old Testament a lot of times when God moves in someone's life when something is done they have to have a date there is a sacrifice you look at job after everything he went through even his friends God told him go get a job to pray for you but job didn't get healed until he prayed for them and then he offered a sacrifice you look at Jacob Jacob when he wrestled with the angel he wrestled all night but then after he won his victory he went in offered a sacrifice you look at Samson even in his death he offered something he sacrificed something he said let me die and then God moved on the scene brother Paul really brought out well on Hannah in the temple again she warned her son but she had to sacrifice him back to God and then God moved on the scene God put all these people through different struggles to get him to a point where they could say okay lord I give myself to you whatever it is you're going to do it's going to go back to the service of the kingdom even John in the belly once he reached that point then he said I will offer sacrifice of Thanksgiving and paid the vows and then God moved on the scene and spit him out online it's that way even in our lives now this was all under the natural blood of a lamb but let's see if we can bring it forward into the New Testament thing but Abram says here in I will restore he said did you ever hear our lamb dying why is the most pathetic thing you ever heard is to hear a little lamb dying enabled with his head pulled back chopped on his little throat like that and the blood just squirting all over the rock on overs hands his little white wool being bathed God looked down and said that's it hallelujah that's is what did I speak of the Lamb of God being led away with hemp rope around his neck two or four thousand years later they're on the cross with mockeries spits as bloody locks dripped all around the shoulders bleeding bleeding speaking in other tongues when he was dying yonder could able understand his lambs voice no sir but he notice voice but he didn't know his language so when he was speaking in tongues at the cross when he was dying he was God's lamb slain from the foundation of the world for lost sinner's remember Abel died on the same Rock his lamb died on and every man that comes to Jesus Christ man or woman boy or girl has got to die on the same Calvary that Jesus died on self-sacrifice laying on that Rock of Ages sacrificing themselves their own ideas their theories and everything and giving fully over to the Holy Spirit certainly that's it once again we see the true sacrifice is a messy thing in order to butter Joe has here summary said man sees what we do but God sees why we do it when you were truly dying to something you'd better be sure we're doing it with the right motive and the right objective because again God sees why we do it back to Hana and analyzing sawara another example that man saw what they did and thought it was wonderful but God saw the heart and it wasn't the truth sacrifice thence judgment struck in Hebrews in Hebrews 10 6 he says in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has no pleasure here he's Paul is talking about the change from the Old Testament under Levitical priesthood over into the New Testament there's a dispensation or change and he's saying we don't need offer sacrifices every year as a temporary solution for our sins is that the perfect sacrifice is being made so now you can forget that that is decreased in value what is the higher value now is the perfect sacrifice which is Jesus Christ and this is where he's trying to say like you no longer required the blood of animals and bulls and goats he said but now you need to go to Christ this is the sacrifice and he said what hast thou done the voice yeah we have the you no longer required the blood of animals also he says here but around brings out about the blood what a sacrifice there was a lot of blood and just as I said a mess but the blood speaks over in Genesis 4:10 he says where has that done the voice of thy brother's blood cries out unto me from the ground Abel's blood had representation before Christ same with our blood it's not the chemistry of the blood or anything it's the life in the blood that has we have representation Scripps pastor tells us that the blood speaks can it speak the token speaks yes sir if we look in Genesis 4 the voice of the blood of abel cried out against Cain and we find in Hebrews 12 24 that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks of better things once again referring back to the burnt offerings from the old sacrifice to the supreme sacrifice the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things to blood speaks it's the life in the blood that does the speaking spoiled a soul that was enable it was the life that was in Christ that cries out better things than any it speaks loud it's the Holy Spirit it speaks plain he tells us that the time is here when we see it for it said it would say it and then we see it come back and identify what I said there's nothing else left to believe it that's right receive it believe for self and applying the token move out some people want to apply the blood and stay in you apply the blood and kick all the trash out and have a house cleaning time sacrifice there's things in our lives that we need to get clear of things we don't even know sometimes but even if we go back to in Sandler's time when the saw went and he was told to kill all the enemy and he didn't he brought them back and had a big sacrifice Samuel said hath the Lord our great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than to sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams I pray that there will be our desires that we would obey and hearken unto God's voice if he's working on our lives we better listen if he's trying to root out some something we better say Lord here am I do to me as the scripture says can the Potter say to the master why have you made me thus it's up to him how he wants to mold us it has nothing to do with what I want in 1st Peter 2:5 he said you also as a lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so we are to offer up spiritual sacrifices well what are some things that we gotta sacrifice in our lives well for some it might be our ideas we might think well we we understand this scripture better than anyone else oh maybe not we gotta sacrifice their own opinions our opinion means nothing what matters is what God says pride there's a lot of pride mentioned in Scripture we have a lot of pride in ourselves sometimes we're proud because we go to this church we're part of the message we understand Scriptures better than others but again who gets the glory me or God we must die the pride we must sacrifice stubbornness there's another big one and unnecessary talk about stubbornness when you trying to solve a problem at work there's a stubbornness where you think you're a little bit above 4 you got something better than someone stubbornness says in Lord I know you want me to do this well you can get yourself in trouble like Balak we must humble ourselves and if the scripture says stubbornness is as our dolla tree we don't want that idolatry means that there's something above Christ there is nothing higher than Christ so for God's grace I pray that we were just humble humble ourselves scripture says home with ourselves unto the mighty hand of God and in due time he will exalt you we'll just leave that with the Lord even our will I want to go here for a vacation well is that the Lord's will for your life I want to work here I want to wait make this much money I want to get married at this point in time go over here for college that's all up to God again God as brother Joel said many times he might want you to be a janitor instead of an engineer he might want you to have a dozen kids instead of two that's God's decision again we have to let God decide what is right for us our ambitions same thing tied with our will we must die to that relations our spouses a kids family unbelieving family again we must sacrifice that to God sometimes these can be a hindrance to us well I'm afraid I might hurt their feelings I'd rather hurt their feelings than hurt God's eye so again we must sacrifice that Matthew 12 speaks dead very plainly over Matthew 12 Matthew 12 verse 46 and says while he had talked with the people behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him you're familiar with this and then one said him behold I have mother and life brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee in verse 38 he said but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said Behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and my sister and my mother he had sold out and died out to his family I'm sure they were a bit offended when he said that and he didn't any refuse to talk to him at that time we must do the same here's an example that's lived before us I know family can be a trap sometimes but again we must sacrifice it our possession our possessions some of us take pride in how much we have really it are we able to truly sing that song at enter a cottage why should I care that do we really care or we just sing in words do we want the big houses to fancy vehicles you look at the rich young ruler Jesus told him one thing he lacked that's it I'm sure I lack a whole lot more than one thing but that's all he lacked and that was his possessions and he wasn't willing to give it up and look where he ended up in hell what injustice a sip of water he didn't give up he didn't sacrifice his possessions time time is another thing that we need to redeem in sacrifice you even just take I'll just take me for instance I spend about nine ten hours a day at work 78 hours a night sleeping so right away I'm up to 18 hours out of 24 I want to get six hours and in the middle of that I got do my other things spend time to family eat so at the end of that I might have an hour left for God out of 24 it's a pretty low percentage so what can I do to sacrifice more time to redeem more time to spend it with him yes I know we got to live in this world but sometimes living in this world involves maybe entertainment or something that takes us away from God as opposed to spending in his presence takes us away from fellowship with one another these are things that have a higher value in God's eyes then in ours past regrets sometimes that there are things that we don't realize that are hindering us they build up complexes in us we must sacrifice these things pray that God would reveal these things to us and that we would go and make these things right better bow I forget now that hopefully st. I you you stubbornness but you can use a lot of these things he said well this is in my past how do I get clear of it he said you go to the author laid before God and walk away don't hold onto it so tightly then when you walk away you're taking it back with you let go leave it turn your back on it when you turn your back on it that means you lose sight of it that's what you got to do when you sacrifice any of these things ourselves there's the biggest hindrance between us and God as ourselves as been said before people will miss heaven by 18 inches to distance between your head and your heart so we must sacrifice that distance everything that stands between us and God a lot of times these our own thinking there's more ideas all these things that were just listed I'm sure there's many more that we could add to this list namekian says he showed the old man what is good but what does Lord require thee but to do justly to love mercy and walk humbly with thy God all these things aren't necessarily humble things ambition is not necessarily a humble attribute we must sacrifice to these things die out forsake it completely lose sight of it if we could turn to Psalms 51 Sam's 51 we'll just back up to verse 15 he said Oh Lord open down my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirous not sacrifices else would I give it now delight is not in burnt offerings the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart O God thou wilt not despise this here is everything in a nutshell humility humble thyself a broken heart that's basically what a broken spirit and a contrite heart is humility with God humble yourselves if you do this it will be well with you God will not dispose it will not reject this sacrifice the more you desire to fall in line with this sacrifice the greater God's movement in your life will be God will move in such ways that you won't even know you'll be surprised in Romans 12 he says I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and like you also to turn to Mark Twain under 12 few minutes here on this is over in mark 9 and in mark 9 near the end I said 42 to the end of the chapter this here is titled that has a warning about Hell here he also talks about like if thy foot offend thee cut it off if the hand off and he cut it off this is the context of the scripture so if you go down to verse 49 of Mark 9 he said for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt salt is good but at the salt hath losses saltness wherewith will you season it have you have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another this is kind of a strange scripture all of a sudden we talk about held in to bring out about salt and in that assault of a sacrifice shall be salted with salt according to the law under Moses a sacrifice was to be salted but this wasn't necessarily for a preservation because once this offering was salted then it was burnt so the idea of a salt being a preservative is not entirely accurate if you read or in the biggest in Leviticus 2 he explains just putting the salt on all the sacraments especially the meat offering the nature of a man has been called flesh and in a lot of times in Scripture flesh refers to the meat and it must be salted in order to be a sacrifice unto God as we just read in Romans 12:1 a living sacrifice so we must have in our souls the savour of grace which is sanctified by the Holy Ghost this is the saltiness Matthew Henry really brings out really well he said those that had the salt of grace must make it appear that they have that if salt in themselves a living principle of grace in their hearts which works out all corrupt dispositions and everything in the soul that tends to putrefaction and would offend our God as unsavoury meat doth our speech must always be with grace seasoned with this salt that no corrupt communication will proceed out of our mouth but that we would love it as much as we were put in putrid mouths in our mouth putrid meat in our mouth as this gracious salt will keep our own conscious void of offense so it will keep our conversations with others so that we would not offend any of Christ's little ones but may be at peace with one another we must not only have this salt of grace but we must always retain the relish and savor of it for if this salt loses its saltiness if a Christian revolt from his Christianity if you step out from underneath the umbrella of God's grace he loses the savour of it and no longer under to him power or the influence of it what can recover him aware with will ye season him as this is said in Matthew 5 as an also another example is of a lease on his birthright well he gave his up his birth weight the scripture says that he saw forth and he couldn't find it he wanted it back but he had give stepped out from underneath that covenant of the birthright it was no longer there for so we must have this and stay underneath this covenant and underneath his saltness those that present not themselves living sacrifices to God's grace shall be made for ever dying sacrifices to his justice they would not submit admit that to subdue the corrupt affections they would not submit to the operation they could not bear the corrosives that were necessary to eat out the proud flesh here is referring to solve as being a corrosive element salts and when you bring in water and air it is highly corrosive when you applied to meet and leave it it will eat up the fatty parts between me and make it nice and tender any on the steps away from Christ they can't stand this corrosiveness to them it is like cutting off a hand or plucking out an eye and therefore in hell as it go back to scripture here he says they will be salted with fire over in Ezekiel talks about the spring king of fire sprinkling of coals on the city and here is referring to base of your time in Hell you have a choice assault is a corrosive preservative in its natural context if we apply this to our spiritual lives salt is it would be used to eat out anything that is not christ-like we see the statue of a perfect man anything that is not here is not of Christ so as this we make our sacrifice and in this context as the salt sacrifice it is eating out anything that is not in line with the stature of a perfect man only thing that stands and will not be rusted or corroded is that which is Christ and the preservative portion of it means that this is an everlasting covenant I'd rather take the cross of knitting that corrosiveness now and burn and burn everything out now tend to burn eternally later that's basically what this is saying here take a bit of salt now in salt in the wounds now it will heal you eventually rather than to be burnt later join all this process we must have a right attitude again at back to today's kiss he must offer the sacrifice willingly he must have the right motive and objective as Pedrosa been preaching lot lately you can't just go about this well maybe Lord I had this problem maybe you can take care of funny thing is sometimes when we want healing we get very specific but let me ask for forgiveness so for something to be taken out of our lives we kind of just throw a blanket over and say lord if this may be this now be specific to if you see something your live as scripture says in the communion scripture to examine ourselves if we see something that is wrong a specific that Lord take carry if not God will put you through a lot of trials to force you to there's a point where you will have to ask for and be a lot easier if we examine ourselves in light of Scripture and bring it to the Lord sacrifice it now and when it comes to attitude is it's not necessarily our sincerity trying to find another world but I'm just gonna go with sincerity but BAM says sit here and sincerity isn't what God requires sincerity is alright but that's not enough perhaps tonight if we go down into the Ganga's River watch those mothers with the little black babies sticking them into the alligators and squish them to death in their mouths sacrificing to the God that sincerity what if you follow me to India and see those people pull off their shoes walk through the fire feet burning blisters or go to China and find their little feet broke up like that and walking on their toes how they make sacrifices and everything very deeply sincere but still that's not salvation sincerity has nothing to do with it many times the heathens who cut themselves and lanced themselves and wait deeper than anything you ever seen acted in Christianity what Christians will hardly walk across the street to a revival that's right but people will do anything even sacrificing their children to their lives but that's it sincerely doesn't spell it there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the way end thereof is the way of death it behooves us to check up now to find out where we're standing we're in the end time no time for plane it's time now to get right and to be sure that you're right it's a continual checking don't just check today so I'm good and in five years time maybe I should check again no as parameter settings many times he said I sin every day and repent every night this is a continual process a lot of times you had to give birth experience before you even died or something why do you die to today or you sacrifice today you could party couldn't of sacrifice 5 10 years ago it's a continual process but we must have the right attitude join all this to be able to accept us no matter what the outcome is no matter what we have the give we have to have the right attitude but a brand brings out on a blind Bartimaeus I was really blessed by this the contact series his daughter got sick and he prayed that God would heal her and if he is healer he would give his two turtledoves as a sacrifice to God is it the next morning little girl was well so he took two turtledoves and offered them up and a week later his wife took sick there was nothing could be done for her he said isn't it strange how tragedies hit families of believers and so it's all for good they went up and he went out to pray if that night he said Lord I haven't got my doves now my begging is getting poorly because there's nothing to attract attention I haven't got nothing in the world to offer you but my lamb but if you'll just let my poor dear wife get well I'll give you my lamb and he went back to the house feeling his way around and the next morning his wife got well so it was a beautiful morning and he started up the street that I am leading him on the hut and the high priest stood up on the top on the banister of the balcony of the temple and he said we're girls now blind bartimaeus he said all high priests I'm going into the sacrifice room I promised God if he'd heal my wife last night I give him my lamb they said all blind bartimaeus you can't give that lamb I'll give you a sacrifice our money to buy you a lamb off at the stalls the very place where Jesus beat them out later he said I'll give you the money to buy them they said all high priests God's blessings be upon you but he said I never promised God a lamb I promised him this lamb that's right that's where it is what are you afraid about you want the world to be Christianized but you're afraid of the Holy Spirit see what about you are we afraid to let the Holy Spirit to dig around in our lives are we so afraid to let him dig around our past door to our private lives let's check our attitudes here and let Jesus in there's so many blessings to come out on the other side he said blind bartimaeus you cannot give that lamb that lamb is your eyes you ain't got no eyes but that lamb bartimaeus and you've trained that lamb to lead you he said that lamb is your eyes it pulls you around you ain't got no eyes but for that and he said he raised his feeble hands and he said o High Priest God will provide a lamb for blind bartimaeus his eyes and he offered the sacrifice he had made a vow and he kept it no matter the consequences he gave up every last bit of sight he had a maneuver in the world he had nothing else he was totally dependent upon God he dare no idea what was going to happen to him he lived his life as a beggar I'm sure he was a good one he provided here scripture says he had a wife kids he probably provided as best he could but it was based on that lamb getting them to him from the prime locations for begging but Harry sacrificed all that his ability to provide cut off he continues by saying one corner member day he's sitting there chilling in the wind and he heard a noise what was it God had provided a lamb for blind Bartimaeus his eyes that's right God got that same land provided this afternoon for everyone sitting here he's got a lamb provided for everyone who and he's here to give it to you and he will give you the power of his they just do exactly what we've asked him to do when in our journey God has his land provided the rocks already been smitten the waters are flowing freely he just had the drinkers in Ephesians he says is that a walk in love as Christ also have loved us and hath given himself for an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour God has already paid everything he's already given a sacrifice why do we hesitate at times to give up something that is contrary to him what do we want to give up hold so dearly on the things that stand between us and perfect communion with him as we see things ramping up in this world we should be ramping up our walk with Christ we should really be getting digging deep getting close a lot of a lot of times we concentrate on doctrines we need us I thank the Lord for but we forget to simpler things or walk with Christ our life even even sometimes forget about others even in Philippians Paul says but I have all and abound I am full having received of the Pafford itis the things which you sent from me an older of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to God so this is not even just about ourselves we also have to look to others sacrifice for them even give him something like even here they must have sent some things to all that he needed maybe it was just a cloak to keep more but he said it is a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable and well pleasing to God we can't be afraid we can't forget those around us they're there to help us as well we're in this together Christ gave us all for us why do we hesitate to give our all to him and that means helping others this is a unit we go together as description you know as I said or jointly fit together that means your other fingers not over there and you pick them up when you need it no it's joined together with the hand everything functions together it has a purpose but you need the elbow in order to move the wrist to lift something you need the head to control everything you need the neck to hold the head up everything works just right for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world he hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself to whom much is given much is required we've heard this many times we were given all so much grace but we must also give all so much grace too many times be sorry we measure sacrifice by how convenient it is that's not true sacrifice sacrifice is when is not convenient it wasn't convenient for Jesus to be tortured and killed that I can assure you but he did it for you and me it wasn't convenient for those in Hebrews 11 the faith chapter who suffered greatly the scripture says those of whom the world wasn't worthy but they gave their all but yet we hesitate sometimes to save Jesus name out in public we hesitate to say thank you Jesus when we see God doing something for us on public well frayed someone's gonna look down at us scripture says if you're ashamed of me I'll be ashamed of you died of pride don't be afraid to speak his name don't be afraid to stand out we sing that song we sing that song a lot of times as you're all on the altar of sacrifice late your heart does the spirit control can we really sing that these are all on the altar God provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect but we gotta be willing to die out to be sold out to sacrifice to forsake everything for Christ we must have the right attitude even been going through these sacrifices and when you go through the sacrifice you look at that through Scripture the examples the blessings that they received once they went through the way through hard times but afterwards even job what he made that sacrifice look at the blessings God bestowed upon him just to bring out a little bit of self righteousness but he had he had more kids more possessions I'm sure he wasn't looking for that but God said you did so well you conformed you sacrifice I'm gonna bless you above and beyond in Psalms 27 as he said and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord as we died out two different things in our lives we become a more short in our peace with Christ we become paultalks buddies she threw as see through a glass darkly but as we get closer to Christ more with died out more we sell out that no longer becomes a dark picture everything comes into focus and the more you die out the more sharper depth until one day with what you see becomes reality and he says let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense we must pray before God pray that he will show these things help us to correct areas in our lives he said under lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice if you could turn with Jeremiah or to Jeremiah 33 and Jeremiah 33 verse 11 and he says the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of Hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord for I will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first as at the first saith the Lord we're going back to the way it was they came from eternity people come back to eternity but we must even in as we go through the sacrifices we also must sacrifice and praise God for everything he's done even as we go through these trials thank him for it is for our perfecting don't go through begrudgingly you'll miss out on what God's trying to do if you see your brother and your sister don't look down on to whom much is required we're also required to give grace hold them up pray for don't just don't just say well you're just going through something no I'm praying for you I'll help you I'll step out with you put my shield above you put my arm around you lift each other up don't care if you're from India or Africa or if you're one side of the family or not we're all in this together going forward into crisis it's a regardless of who what the natural connection is location or family relations is doesn't mean nothing to God Hebrews 13 assists by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased don't hole up get hold up in yourself communicate do good don't forget to do these things don't just keep everything over here no don't be afraid to talk to your brother and your sister Bible says confess your faults one to another communicate again their prayer might be the one thing that releases you from the thing - even fighting for so many years how do you know talk about it you late before God but if God lays it too late tell someone else your experience your struggle don't hesitate die - pride its pride that keeps us from talking to each other sometimes they say well I'm going through this they're gonna look down on me know if their Holy Ghost sanctified brothers and sisters they will not look down they will come and pick you up and pray with you so you can overcome these areas in your lives a lot of times we fight things too long because we don't have our brothers and sisters praying for us specifically don't just say I'll pray for me I'm going through something you know anyone can say that but to say the golda better Dave is saying is it better I'm fighting this problem can you pray with me I'm sure he'll pray for you go to a sister same thing God might be waiting on you to do that one thing before you get released from something that has been bothering you you keep struggling and struggling maybe it's time to get someone else to help pray with you again die just die out the pride humble yourself over in Hebrews in Hebrews 10 this might be a bit of reading here but I just we got a bit of time here so in Hebrews 10 verse 1 he said for the shadow have for the law having a shadow of good things to come again he's talked about things aren't very clear and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect so again referring back to the Old Testament he said under the blood of bulls and goats you couldn't really come to perfection it was still a cloudy picture you can only go so far and no further until the perfect sacrifice came for them would they not have ceased to be offered because the worst was once purged should have not have had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of the sins every year this is only a temporary thing for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice and offering that what's not but a body has not prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin but ours had no pleasure again this is talking about the dispensational change then said i lo i come in the volume of the book is written of me to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wouldst not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will O God and he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which we are will we by the wit will we are sanctified through the offering of the blood that the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice can never take away sins referring to the Levitical priesthood but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified wherefore the Holy Ghost is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws in their heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an High Priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without raving wavering for he is faithful that promised and let's let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works again we're not in this by ourselves let us consider one another to provoke unto love now forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching so much more as you see the Day approaching we can see that fulfillment of Scripture as in the day is a protein so let us saw much more get in fellowship with each other and with Christ nor do this we must come under the Express image of Christ which is that divine love which extends grace for all things but Obama he says here he said I believe the Bible is inspired Word of God every word of it is inspired I don't believe just this is not inspired and this isn't that is I believe it's all inspired and it's either all right or all wrong or or it's all and if it's all mixed up then we don't know what to do but it's every bit the truth I'm willing to sacrifice my life for what thus saith the Lord is here are we willing to sacrifice everything for what this publicist are we the sacrifice are everything that was mentioned our own wills our ideas everything for thus saith the Lord if God tells us to do something we must do it without hesitation if this is true if everything in this Bible is true why do we still try to control parts of our lives scripture says he to put his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the kingdom that's someone still trying to control their life you're still caught up with the things of the world we must look forward never looked back we're seeing also their song so I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which is committed that which he has promised he's more than able to keep us he's more than able to help us he's more than able to help us to die out to sell out he's more than able to help us to overcome the areas in our lives where were weak perfect strength of perfect weakness God will take nothing and make something he started man with just a ball of clay which is nothing but yet he created man and we are nothing but a ball of clay and he can create something wonderful it also says here casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth is saw itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and Paul says in Philippians I said for me to live is Christ and to die is gain if we if we get everything in line with our attitude humble ourselves seeking God's will continually praying then we could have said about us as what even was said about Solomon he said in second chronicles he's now on Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house may that be our prayer that as we sacrificed these things that the glory of the Lord will fill our house it would fill all of our houses and has been coming to God's presence we each bring our part of that glory into one pillow far we're in this together and as he says here for again we were to cast down everything cast down imaginations every high thing that is above Christ those 5 senses of the Spirit we fight them daily imagination it's pretty powerful sometimes you see someone over there talking all but they're talking about me we need to cast that down that's imagination then your reasoning kicks in all these other things die to it pants have created everything check everything against the word if you're struggling give it to God I only want that sense of faith be tapping into God I prayed that God would just help us to rise above those senses and just tap into his presence or faith only enters and I pray that we would continue to walk in love as Christ has loved us divine love overlooks all these things divine love extends grace divine love humbles ourselves divine love is not one to try to get ahead or to try to control the situation divine love that God lead may that be our prayer and his mark prayer does he would do so with each and every one of us that we would die and it says once again and winding down here now I'm finished with this I'll read the scripture again for to for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain I prayed to God that that is our prayer there's just a million but I Bob get ready I just just say one of the prayer I'll turn it over to butter Bob a dear
