[41:37] and
[41:41] king. Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to
[41:44] welcome each one of you here tonight.
[41:46] It's good to see sister Becky with us
[41:48] and brother Barry as well. We always say
[41:50] when we invite the ministers, we want
[41:52] their wives to come as well because they
[41:53] just settle in and relax all of the
[41:55] more. So trusting you're a calming
[41:57] influence tonight and throughout the
[41:59] week, Sister Becky, but it's good to see
[42:00] each one here. And we want to welcome
[42:02] Brother Barry. I was just talking to him
[42:03] in the office there and he said it's 40
[42:06] years he's been pastoring this year. 40
[42:09] years. Now, Brother Bob told me last
[42:11] service that it'll be 45 years this year
[42:13] that he's been song leading. Now, I know
[42:15] the stress isn't the same, but I think
[42:17] if there's one thing we know, it means
[42:18] we have some older people amongst us now
[42:21] for 45 years. I've only been alive for
[42:23] 45 years. He got baptized two and a half
[42:25] months after I was born. So, I say, God
[42:28] bless you, Brother Barry. That that is
[42:30] an amazing thing. I know I'm teasing a
[42:32] bit about age, but you consider 40 years
[42:34] of serving in a ministry. It's a it's a
[42:37] tremendous thing to come through with
[42:38] your with your sanity, with your hair,
[42:41] with your health, and all these
[42:42] different things. Amen. Brother Gerald,
[42:44] I think, was 43 years. So, it's hard to
[42:46] imagine somebody that is just a few
[42:49] years behind that. But I say God bless
[42:51] you to brother Barry. Certainly
[42:52] appreciate him coming here. You know,
[42:54] Newfoundland's not exactly Newfoundland
[42:57] in March is hardly a premium location.
[43:00] It was even less of one in February. And
[43:02] uh I have to say I I wasn't surprised
[43:05] when they had to cancel because of the
[43:07] weather and the the events in Toronto
[43:10] with the plane crash and that and they
[43:11] just headed in the complete opposite
[43:12] direction and went to Arizona instead
[43:14] where it was warm and sunny. But he
[43:17] brought the sun back with us. I see
[43:19] today. And I'm just so thankful. We've
[43:20] been talking about doing this for two
[43:22] years, I think, for the very since we
[43:24] last since we originally started
[43:25] speaking of it and just getting it to
[43:27] where it would work out for all of us.
[43:29] But I'm very appreciative for them
[43:30] coming. So I I said I would take the
[43:33] service tonight. They landed in late
[43:34] last night and he said, "No, I'm willing
[43:36] to do it." I said, "If you're willing to
[43:38] do it, I'll let you take it." So I'm
[43:40] looking forward to just sitting back and
[43:42] hearing the word of the Lord tonight.
[43:43] Amen. So let's sing um that song. Be it
[43:47] unto me according to your word
[43:49] 10,08,08, sorry, 108. As brother Barry
[43:53] would come and let's just Amen. Let's
[43:55] pull on the word. Let's enjoy what the
[43:56] Lord has in store for us. Amen. Let's
[44:00] just sing
[44:02] this. Oh, be it
[44:05] unto
[44:08] me according to your
[44:15] word. According to your
[44:21] promises, I can
[44:24] stand secure.
[44:28] right upon my
[44:33] heart. The truth that sets me
[44:40] free according to your word, oh
[44:47] Lord. Be it unto me.
[44:53] [Music]
[44:59] to the glory to your
[45:06] word. Glory to your
[45:13] proises. I can
[45:16] stand
[45:19] your right
[45:21] upon my heart.
[45:26] The
[45:28] truth
[45:32] we according to your word.
[45:46] Praise the
[45:49] Lord.
[45:51] Am
[45:53] I
[45:55] on? God bless you. It's good to be in
[45:57] the house of the Lord. Good to see all
[46:00] your smiling faces tonight. And God
[46:02] bless you. It's always an honor to be
[46:05] here. And uh just want to say we
[46:08] appreciate coming and being here.
[46:11] Appreciate seeing my two favorite
[46:13] sisters in here and all of you that come
[46:19] tonight. God bless you. Uh let's take
[46:21] your Bible while you're standing here
[46:22] and let's let's do this because you've
[46:24] been standing here. Ezekiel chapter 45.
[46:28] Let's bring that bring that up here,
[46:29] boys. And uh there we
[46:32] go. And
[46:36] uh I'm going to follow this uh pretty
[46:39] closely here.
[46:41] So here we
[46:43] go. Ezekiel chapter
[46:46] 45. And
[46:49] uh I just like to add this to what
[46:52] brother John said about bringing your
[46:54] wife with you to when you travel. I
[46:58] we're I'm blessed, you know, because
[46:59] Sister Becky always doesn't get to come,
[47:02] but she's with us tonight and and I
[47:04] appreciate that. But she's the one who
[47:06] keeps me straight and keeps, you know,
[47:09] keeps me well behaved.
[47:12] So, it's for your benefit she's
[47:16] here and uh but we're we always delight
[47:20] in coming to New Foundland for sure. All
[47:23] right. Ezekiel chapter 45. We're going
[47:25] to read it verse 18. We're going to call
[47:26] this shalom in the home and subtitle it
[47:30] reconcile the house. Before we read the
[47:32] word, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we're
[47:35] so thankful, Lord, for this opportunity
[47:36] we have to be gathered in your house to
[47:39] meet with your people, Lord, and to read
[47:41] your word. And we believe this is your
[47:44] word and these are your people. And I
[47:46] pray you'd bring the two of them
[47:48] together. And Lord, may you just speak
[47:50] to hearts. And I know, Lord, the very
[47:52] best thing that I can do is just step
[47:54] back now and just let you have your way
[47:56] and have free course among us. And in
[47:59] order to do that, Lord, we first want to
[48:01] say, look at us through the blood of
[48:03] Jesus Christ that we might be forgiven
[48:05] of anything that might be contrary to
[48:07] the moving of the Holy Spirit. So have
[48:10] your way now we pray. Quicken the word
[48:11] to our hearts. We ask in Jesus lovely
[48:14] name we pray. Amen. And amen. All right.
[48:18] Ezekiel 45:18. Thus sayeth the Lord God,
[48:22] in the first month and the first day of
[48:24] the month, thou shalt take a young
[48:26] bulock without blemish, and cleanse the
[48:29] sanctuary. And the priest shalt take of
[48:31] the blood of the sin offering, and put
[48:32] it upon the posts of the house, and upon
[48:34] the four corners of the of the settle of
[48:37] the altar, and upon the posts of the
[48:39] gate of the inner court. And so shalt
[48:42] thou do the seventh day of the month for
[48:45] everyone that erth or everyone that
[48:47] sins, everyone that needs an offering
[48:49] for sin. And for them that is simple.
[48:52] For him that is simple. So shall you
[48:55] reconcile the house. May God add his
[48:58] blessing. You may be seated this morning
[49:00] this
[49:03] evening. Now um I just like to say this
[49:06] that uh 40 years is a long time but it
[49:09] doesn't seem that long. uh just seems
[49:12] like uh it's always been and ironically
[49:16] this is where it all began. Not in this
[49:19] church, but this is where it all began,
[49:22] right here in New Foundland. And here
[49:24] here we are back full circle again. And
[49:27] uh we've had lots and lots of
[49:29] interesting experiences for sure. And
[49:32] thankful that I'm still able to tie my
[49:33] own shoes after 40 years of pastoring
[49:36] and uh still able to sit upright and
[49:38] take a little nourishment. And that's
[49:40] good. And uh I think brother, you know,
[49:44] brother Brandon made a statement. He
[49:45] said, "There's nothing better that a
[49:48] person could be than a minister of the
[49:50] gospel." He said, "There's nothing
[49:52] better that you could be." And uh you
[49:55] know, if if you knew me back when, you
[49:58] would not have pegged me for a minister
[50:00] of the gospel if you'd known me
[50:03] beforehand. But God knew. Let me tell
[50:07] you something. I remember living on a
[50:09] little Greek island in the Mediterranean
[50:12] Sea. Um, and we were we were there in a
[50:18] uh in a journey, let's put it that way.
[50:21] And uh wound up in this on this island
[50:24] of Corfu and there was a little town in
[50:27] there called Aguia Galini and that's
[50:29] where that's where we were hanging out
[50:32] and I thought, wow, what this is a place
[50:34] I could live for the rest of my life. I
[50:36] could be here. It was so warm and nice
[50:39] and we picked oranges and olives to make
[50:41] a little bit bit of cash and that's how
[50:43] we lived. And this is before the
[50:45] message. Now I got to I got to qualify
[50:47] that. This was before the message in in
[50:49] my former days. And uh I was just
[50:53] traveling in the world looking for
[50:54] something real and and I remember being
[50:57] in that little town and I met a guy who
[50:59] was from California and he was a teacher
[51:02] of some sort and he and I got to talking
[51:05] and he said, "What are you doing here?"
[51:06] Because that's what you'd always ask
[51:07] when you found yourself in a weird place
[51:09] overseas uh without any obvious
[51:12] direction. And you'd say, "What are you
[51:13] doing here?" And I I asked him, "What
[51:14] are you doing here?" And he said, "We're
[51:16] just on a vacation." And I said, "Well,
[51:17] I'm I'm I guess to be honest, I'm in a
[51:20] I'm on a search. I'm looking for
[51:21] something real because I didn't know God
[51:22] back then. I didn't know anything about
[51:24] the message and I did I thought King
[51:26] James is just a king in England. And so
[51:28] I didn't know anything about the Bible
[51:29] or anything at all. And so u uh I I told
[51:34] him I was just looking for something
[51:35] true, something real. And he said, "You
[51:38] ought to take a certain aptitude
[51:40] test." And I said, "Really?" And he
[51:42] said, "Yeah, we give this in California
[51:44] all the time." And he said, "It's an
[51:45] aptitude test that'll tell you your
[51:47] strengths and weaknesses and tell you
[51:48] what you probably will be." And I said,
[51:50] "Well, yeah, I guess." And so I wrote
[51:53] down the name of the test. It was a
[51:55] specific kind of a test that I think is
[51:58] still in existence. And uh I I I came
[52:01] home a year later. I was gone on that
[52:03] journey a year later and wound up and I
[52:05] had this little piece of paper and in I
[52:07] had a little diary and I has and in the
[52:09] back of it was the name of this test. So
[52:10] I went to the University of Nefound here
[52:13] in town and I said, "I'd like to take an
[52:15] aptitude test. Can you arrange this for
[52:17] me?" because I was a student back then.
[52:19] And they said, "Sure, no problem." And
[52:21] they they ordered the test and brought
[52:23] it in. I took it and uh they sent off
[52:26] for the results a month later or
[52:27] something because back then we did
[52:29] everything by mail. Mail. Mail is a kind
[52:32] of a thing where you put words on paper
[52:35] and you lick it and put stamps on it and
[52:37] put it in the box and then it goes
[52:39] somewhere and it comes back for some of
[52:41] you young people that are here. And I
[52:44] got the results back and and uh I I
[52:47] looked at it and when I opened up the
[52:48] paper and looked at it, it said you're
[52:51] going to be one of two things in life.
[52:53] Number one was a ch was the uh the the
[52:59] uh president of the local chamber of
[53:01] commerce in your city. That's what
[53:03] you're going to be number one. And the
[53:06] second uh option for you is that you're
[53:08] going to be a
[53:11] minister. Yeah. All right.
[53:13] And I, you know, I mean, I'm I'm, you
[53:15] know, long-haired, hippie, all of that.
[53:19] And, you know, it didn't say priest. It
[53:22] said, "You're going to be a minister of
[53:24] the
[53:26] gospel." Well, I just took the paper
[53:30] and threw it away. And I thought, "What
[53:32] a waste. What a
[53:34] waste." But God
[53:37] knew. That was
[53:39] 1979. Early 1979, December 23rd, 1979, I
[53:44] was baptized in the name of the Lord
[53:45] Jesus Christ. Began to minister a couple
[53:48] of years later, Brother Gerald had had
[53:50] everything to do with that because you
[53:52] remember, you guys will remember that
[53:53] when Brother Gerald left town one time,
[53:55] he said, "All right, you boys got it."
[53:57] We were the only three boys in church,
[54:00] right? So he said, "You guys got it."
[54:03] And Mark said, "I'm not going to do it."
[54:04] Bob said, "I'm not going to do it." That
[54:07] was my calling to preach the
[54:10] gospel. Brother Ggerald, it's all your
[54:13] fault. It's good to see Brother Gerald
[54:15] and Sister Betty. And uh so that's how
[54:18] it began. But you know, I' I've been uh
[54:21] we've had lots and lots of experiences,
[54:22] traveled all over the world. Somebody
[54:25] asked me the other day how many
[54:27] countries I've been to, and I said, I
[54:29] have absolutely no idea uh at all. and
[54:33] uh but it's been a pleasure to minister
[54:34] to God's people all over the world and
[54:36] meet so many people and uh minister in
[54:38] all kinds of different uh nations and
[54:41] with different languages and everything
[54:42] else. So, it it's been a blessing and uh
[54:46] you know, we still love to go and love
[54:47] to travel and and uh love to meet God's
[54:50] people. But I just wanted to uh do this
[54:53] tonight without without much further ado
[54:55] here. Uh, in my church, they put a great
[54:57] big clock in the back of the church, but
[55:01] you don't have one
[55:02] here. All right. One of the most
[55:05] successful, and by by successful, I mean
[55:08] uh mostly listened to series that I ever
[55:12] did was this thing called Shalom in the
[55:14] Home. And uh I came up with this uh
[55:17] title uh based on a a verse in Jeremiah,
[55:20] which I will read in just a second here.
[55:22] And uh I didn't realize that uh Shalom
[55:26] in the home was actually the name of a
[55:28] television program long before my time
[55:31] like before uh I I came in the message
[55:33] and I had no idea that that that's where
[55:36] it came from. And this fellow who was a
[55:40] counselor type uh an adviser counselor,
[55:43] personal counselor and he was a Jewish
[55:45] man lived in New York. And the way he
[55:47] counsel people is that if they a family
[55:49] came to him and said, "Hey, we're having
[55:51] problems with our teenagers. We're
[55:52] having problems with our marriage." He
[55:54] would actually go to their house and
[55:56] live in their house for a month. He got
[55:59] permission to live in their house for a
[56:01] month and he would analyze them. He'd
[56:03] just kind of hang around and he'd
[56:04] observe them and get to know them and
[56:06] and as he got to know them, he would
[56:08] figure out, ah, okay, that's where their
[56:10] weakness is. That's where their problem
[56:11] is. And I thought, wow, that's that's
[56:13] really quite a unique approach to
[56:16] counseling. So, I'm here to tell you
[56:19] that I'm going to be moving
[56:21] [Music]
[56:23] in. My first place is Grenful
[56:27] Avenue. No, not really. But uh I I
[56:31] thought this was this is quite an
[56:33] interesting way to do it. But he titled
[56:35] that Shalom in the Home. And he actually
[56:36] wrote a book called Shalom in the Home.
[56:38] And there was a a television series. But
[56:40] uh I I will show you where uh where this
[56:43] actually came from
[56:46] here.
[56:48] Um shalom in the shalom in the home is
[56:51] actually a Jewish proverb and it means
[56:54] domestic tranquility. It's the ultimate
[56:56] blessing. Now, in the common Jewish
[56:59] Bible, and I often read from the comm
[57:02] Jewish Bible, does this
[57:05] work?
[57:08] What? Pointed at the
[57:11] back. Ah, got it, Matt. God bless you,
[57:14] buddy. Thanks for coming up. First Peter
[57:17] chapter 5. Likewise, you younger men,
[57:20] this is the common Jewish Bible, of
[57:22] lesser rank and experience, being
[57:25] younger, be subject to your elders, or
[57:28] seek their counsel, and all of you
[57:31] clothe yourselves with humility toward
[57:33] one another. All of you. So, the younger
[57:36] men should be submissive or at least
[57:38] open to the counsel of the elders.
[57:40] for for all of you, he says, clothe
[57:43] yourselves with humility toward one
[57:45] another or and this is the way it's
[57:47] written in the in the in the common
[57:49] Jewish Bible, tie on the apron. The
[57:51] apron is a symbol of service, isn't it?
[57:54] And it's and it's one where somebody's
[57:56] willing to work. They're willing to get
[57:57] in. They're not just observing, but
[57:59] they're participating. You remember when
[58:01] brother Brandham had problems in his
[58:04] home? You remember that? His wife was
[58:05] about to lose her mind with all the
[58:07] stresses and so forth. You remember what
[58:09] he did? He went to the kitchen sink,
[58:11] took the apron and tied it on because he
[58:14] needed to come back to shalom in the
[58:17] home. There was not shalom in the home
[58:19] and he had to come back to that. For God
[58:21] is opposed to the proud. He resists the
[58:24] proud and he defeats them, but he gives
[58:26] grace to the humble. And so therefore,
[58:29] uh, this is this is found in the Old
[58:31] Testament and the New Testament as well.
[58:33] All right, here's the verse in
[58:34] Zechariah, wasn't Jeremiah chapter 8. So
[58:37] again have I thought in those days to do
[58:39] well unto Jerusalem and to the house of
[58:41] Judah, fear ye not. Now this is
[58:43] Zechariah telling the the Israelite
[58:45] people and they're in captivity now.
[58:48] They're in captivity. Zechariah is a
[58:49] fascinating book. It has to do with uh
[58:52] the Jews coming back from Israel and he
[58:55] talks about that. But the majority of
[58:57] the book was prophetic. It's about our
[58:59] time more than their time. And you can
[59:02] find lots and lots of really pertinent
[59:04] things in the book of Zechariah about
[59:06] the day we live in. You ought to give it
[59:08] a shot. You ought to go look at it and
[59:10] read it, especially the last part of it,
[59:12] and you'll find lots of things about the
[59:14] day that we're living in. So he says, "I
[59:16] have thought in those days to do well.
[59:18] I'm going to restore you. These are the
[59:19] things that you shall do when you go
[59:21] back home." Because there's they're away
[59:24] in Babylon. When you go back home,
[59:27] number one, speak ye every man truth to
[59:29] his neighbor. be honest. Number two,
[59:33] execute or govern the judgment of truth
[59:37] and peace in your gates. So, inside your
[59:40] home, the way I want you to govern or
[59:43] the way that I want you to run your
[59:45] household is with two things, truth and
[59:49] peace. So, you need to have shalom in
[59:51] your gates or shalom in your say it
[59:55] home. Shalom in your home. And so that's
[59:58] where this this idea came from. And let
[1:00:00] none of you imagine evil in your hearts
[1:00:02] against his neighbor and love no false
[1:00:03] oath. For all these things uh I hate
[1:00:06] sayeth the Lord. And so therefore uh
[1:00:08] this is what God told the children of
[1:00:10] Israel when you go back home. This is
[1:00:12] how I want you to live. How I want you
[1:00:13] to govern your house is do it this way.
[1:00:16] All right. So this series then became
[1:00:18] about how do we achieve shalom or peace
[1:00:21] in our gates. And that's what this is
[1:00:24] about. So this particular module here or
[1:00:27] this particular sermon is about
[1:00:29] reconciliation. All right. So we'll get
[1:00:31] to that. Just give me a little minute
[1:00:32] here to preamble. Brother Bam said in
[1:00:34] how can I overcome? He said remember
[1:00:37] you're living for God. You have one
[1:00:39] objective and that's Jesus Christ.
[1:00:40] That's first. Secondly you live for your
[1:00:43] family. Thirdly you live for yourself.
[1:00:46] Now that's
[1:00:47] counterculture. That's not how the
[1:00:49] culture views it, right? because
[1:00:51] everybody looks out for themselves and
[1:00:53] we are uh I mean we are in a sense a
[1:00:55] narcissistic kind of a culture. Uh we're
[1:00:58] we're very focused on ourselves and our
[1:01:00] happiness and our success and our
[1:01:02] possessions and everything else. And
[1:01:04] brother Bam's giving us a formula here
[1:01:06] for how you want to live successfully.
[1:01:08] He said but first God next your family
[1:01:10] next for you. He says you're number
[1:01:11] three. Put yourself last. He did. Now
[1:01:14] let me let me draw attention to fathers
[1:01:16] just for a minute here. And I do lots of
[1:01:18] things uh on fathers here. And uh we we
[1:01:22] we can talk a little bit uh uh just for
[1:01:26] a few minutes here about about the role
[1:01:28] of fathers. And this is really an
[1:01:30] interesting uh thing because fatherhood
[1:01:33] is an attribute of God. You you might
[1:01:36] think I don't you talk about anything
[1:01:38] else but families. Well, I do, but uh
[1:01:42] but I'm here and I I have to do what I'm
[1:01:45] told to do here.
[1:01:47] And so fathers, fatherhood is an
[1:01:50] attribute of of God. God has lots of
[1:01:52] attributes, right? Savior,
[1:01:55] healer, right? Counselor, judge, king,
[1:01:57] all of those things. But he's also a
[1:01:59] father. And in order to be a father, you
[1:02:01] have to have children. You can be a
[1:02:03] husband without being a father. But if
[1:02:04] you're a father, you have offspring. And
[1:02:06] so therefore, you have a certain
[1:02:07] responsibility when you're a father.
[1:02:09] Through wisdom is an house build, and by
[1:02:12] understanding it is established. And by
[1:02:14] knowledge shall the chambers be filled
[1:02:16] with all precious and pleasant riches. A
[1:02:18] wise man is strong. Yay, a man of
[1:02:22] knowledge increase strength. For by wise
[1:02:25] counsel thou shalt make thy war, and in
[1:02:28] the multitude of counselors there is
[1:02:30] safety. So uh Solomon here is addressing
[1:02:33] wise men. Wise men are strong. Again, we
[1:02:37] find in the common Jewish Bible, a wise
[1:02:40] warrior is strong. A wise warrior is
[1:02:44] strong and a man of knowledge makes his
[1:02:46] strength stronger. One of the reasons
[1:02:48] I'm here to talk about marriage is that
[1:02:50] no matter how good your marriage is, you
[1:02:51] can always make it a little goodter.
[1:02:54] Right? Marriage enrichment means that
[1:02:56] you can enrich something even more and
[1:02:59] you can make it better because none of
[1:03:01] us are perfect.
[1:03:02] Right? If you think you're perfect,
[1:03:04] look, look right or left to your spouse
[1:03:07] and then you'll know exactly what I'm
[1:03:08] talking about.
[1:03:10] A wise warrior is strong and a man of
[1:03:12] knowledge makes his strength
[1:03:13] stronger. For with guidance you wage
[1:03:17] war. You wage war very carefully. You
[1:03:20] don't want to just barge in. You want to
[1:03:22] you want to make you want to calculate
[1:03:24] things before you wage war. And with
[1:03:26] numerous
[1:03:27] advisors there is victory. So therefore
[1:03:31] uh for a wise man they're going to uh
[1:03:34] take a very steady aim when it comes to
[1:03:38] uh fighting battles. There's there are
[1:03:41] there are battles and there are choices
[1:03:43] and there are things you're going to
[1:03:44] have to deal with all of your life and
[1:03:46] you never seem to outgrow it. You never
[1:03:48] seem to outlive the responsibilities uh
[1:03:50] when it comes to making choices. They
[1:03:52] they will they will be with you for a
[1:03:54] long long time. Paul told Timothy in the
[1:03:57] message why to stir up the gift that was
[1:04:00] in him that came from his grandmother
[1:04:02] Lois. It's interesting. Here's the first
[1:04:04] church age messenger handing off to
[1:04:07] Timothy and he's telling Timothy, you
[1:04:10] pay attention to the gift that your
[1:04:12] grandmother had. Interesting, isn't it?
[1:04:16] Your life will impress your children and
[1:04:19] your influence and influence your
[1:04:22] children by the example you set before
[1:04:25] them. Your life has the potential to
[1:04:29] affect people around you. And I think
[1:04:31] it's a good thing that we put every
[1:04:32] effort we can before our children as
[1:04:34] godly effort uh godly parents to be an
[1:04:37] example. I think it's a good thing that
[1:04:39] we put every effort we can before our
[1:04:41] children as godly parents.
[1:04:48] Your attitude towards Christ, brother
[1:04:50] Brandham says, will make a great
[1:04:52] impression on what your children will
[1:04:53] be. Wow. Your life that you live before
[1:04:57] your family will make an impression on
[1:04:59] what your children will be. Hey folks,
[1:05:02] this is not Dr. Dobson here. This is a
[1:05:04] 20th century prophet to a 20th century
[1:05:06] people, right? And he's he's being
[1:05:09] repetitive here. Your attitude and your
[1:05:11] life that you live before your family
[1:05:13] will make an impression of what your
[1:05:15] children will
[1:05:16] be. Because in many ways, a father
[1:05:19] represents God to his children. And if
[1:05:22] his children, if a man's children come
[1:05:24] to him and say, "Dad, what does this
[1:05:26] mean? Leave me alone. I had a rough day
[1:05:28] at work. Don't talk to me." And every
[1:05:29] time they ask him a question, they
[1:05:31] respond that way. They're going to feel
[1:05:33] like, "Well, why should I go to God?"
[1:05:36] Because the Bible said that he would
[1:05:39] visit the iniquity of the parents upon
[1:05:41] the children to the third and fourth
[1:05:43] generation. So our attitude in our life
[1:05:45] that we live before our family. Whether
[1:05:47] you realize it or not, a husband and
[1:05:49] wife are ambassadors of marriage to
[1:05:52] their
[1:05:53] children. They are ambassadors. They are
[1:05:55] the ones who teach their children what
[1:05:57] marriage is really like. Because you
[1:06:00] know, we can all come to church and see
[1:06:01] married couples sitting here in the pew
[1:06:02] and everybody's nice. Nobody's hitting
[1:06:04] anyone, right? Nobody's saying, you
[1:06:07] know, sharp things to one another.
[1:06:09] Everybody looks nice and peaceful,
[1:06:11] well-dressed, coordinated, sitting
[1:06:13] relatively close. And, you know, you you
[1:06:17] sometimes you can look and say, "Wow,
[1:06:19] everything must be great. You don't need
[1:06:20] me here." But I will tell you that you
[1:06:23] really don't know how a family lives
[1:06:25] until you live with
[1:06:27] them. And children get to live with you.
[1:06:30] And they see a lot of things related to
[1:06:32] your marriage. And so therefore, you're
[1:06:34] you are an ambassador. You are a role
[1:06:37] model to your children. They're going to
[1:06:39] see how things really are. How does dad
[1:06:42] handle a situation like this? How does
[1:06:44] dad handle uh a job layoff? How do we uh
[1:06:48] solve a difference here when it comes to
[1:06:50] what vacation do we take and how do we
[1:06:53] uh you know, how do we handle a
[1:06:54] situation where you know, we've got to
[1:06:56] make a choice and we've got to come to a
[1:06:59] decision here. And the wife says, "Well,
[1:07:01] you know, I've said all I'm going to
[1:07:02] say, now it's up to you." So, you know,
[1:07:04] children are looking at that and they're
[1:07:06] wondering how, you know, how's this
[1:07:07] going to come
[1:07:08] out? And whether we like it or not,
[1:07:12] whether you're good at it or not, you're
[1:07:14] an ambassador for marriage to your
[1:07:17] children. So, it's important that we uh
[1:07:20] we strive to maintain a good attitude
[1:07:23] and and uh get things get things just
[1:07:26] right because here's the idea. Here's
[1:07:29] the principle that as parents we impart
[1:07:33] things to our children, right? By
[1:07:35] example, we we we impress them if you
[1:07:38] like. We impart certain things. This is
[1:07:41] uh a couple of places where we find this
[1:07:43] word impart. He answered and said said
[1:07:46] unto them, he that hath two coats, let
[1:07:48] him impart to him that hath none, and he
[1:07:50] that hath meat, let him do likewise. Or
[1:07:53] Paul said in Romans 1, I long for I long
[1:07:55] to see you that I may impart unto you
[1:07:57] some some spiritual gift. It is it is
[1:08:00] appropriate and it is a common principle
[1:08:02] in scripture to have the elder impart
[1:08:05] something to the
[1:08:07] younger children. And you'll find
[1:08:10] phrases in the Old Testament like uh
[1:08:13] where David writes in one of the Psalms.
[1:08:15] He says uh teach your children and your
[1:08:18] children's
[1:08:19] children the principles which be the
[1:08:21] oracles of God. And so the idea is that
[1:08:23] the elder who's been around longer and
[1:08:25] knows should know more. He passes on or
[1:08:28] the aged woman in Titus chapter 2, she
[1:08:31] is to teach the younger women. She's
[1:08:34] imparting something to the younger uh
[1:08:36] the younger generation. And that's
[1:08:38] important for us to realize that we have
[1:08:40] the responsibility to do
[1:08:42] that even if we're not good at it.
[1:08:45] That's why we need to learn. So the
[1:08:47] Bible tells us we can impart certain
[1:08:50] things. What can I impart? You might be
[1:08:51] sitting there and saying, "Well, I don't
[1:08:52] know very much myself. What can I
[1:08:54] impart?" Well, number one, you can
[1:08:56] impart godly values and priorities to
[1:08:58] your children. You can have an attitude
[1:09:01] in your house that says, "As for me and
[1:09:02] my house, we'll serve the Lord." And you
[1:09:04] know what? We're going to go to church.
[1:09:06] I have people in I' I've run into people
[1:09:09] over the years and they you know
[1:09:10] sometimes you look around say where's so
[1:09:12] and so and they say well they didn't
[1:09:13] come to church. Why didn't they come to
[1:09:15] church? Because somebody visited
[1:09:17] somebody visited their house.
[1:09:21] Hello. I I I always told our boys if
[1:09:24] somebody visits our house on Sunday
[1:09:26] morning uh they have a choice. You can
[1:09:29] come on with us to church or you can
[1:09:31] wait here till we get back. But as for
[1:09:34] me and my house we're going to go to
[1:09:35] church. Sorry, bud. We're not going to
[1:09:37] sit around here and take a big gulper
[1:09:39] and just, you know, small talk about the
[1:09:42] weather. I got church to go to. Now,
[1:09:45] when you say those kinds of things and
[1:09:47] when you actually practice those kinds
[1:09:48] of things, you are impressing your
[1:09:50] children. Oh, kids. Oh, wow. That's what
[1:09:53] that's how it works. We go to we put
[1:09:54] church first.
[1:09:59] Yeah. You know, you're all saying,
[1:10:01] "Amen." Because I know how you've been
[1:10:02] raised.
[1:10:05] Don't forget I was raised here
[1:10:09] too. But I will tell you this that
[1:10:11] there's a lot of people who don't know
[1:10:12] that, never heard that, and don't want
[1:10:14] to hear it. Number two, you you need to
[1:10:18] impart how to make good decisions. How
[1:10:20] how do we make good decisions? How do
[1:10:23] parents make good decisions? Well, I I
[1:10:26] demonstrated that a little last time
[1:10:28] when I was here. We we go we go back and
[1:10:31] and we have a basis for our decisions.
[1:10:33] our our our our basis or our authority
[1:10:36] is based on the Bible, based on the
[1:10:38] message and based on the leadership of
[1:10:40] the Holy Spirit and so forth. And so we
[1:10:42] pray about our decisions. We wait on God
[1:10:45] for the answers to our
[1:10:47] decisions. What can I impart also to my
[1:10:49] kids as the courage to stand alone
[1:10:51] because there are sometimes you're going
[1:10:53] to have to make a decision and you may
[1:10:54] be the only one that uh agrees with that
[1:10:57] decision, but you're going to stand
[1:10:58] there because it's the right thing to do
[1:11:00] or the right thing for your children.
[1:11:02] And you've got to be willing to stand
[1:11:03] alone to do that. Or uh the the uh the
[1:11:06] ability to impart uh the the opportunity
[1:11:10] to create a sense of security for your
[1:11:12] family because you should be as a as a
[1:11:15] father, you should be the one who stands
[1:11:17] between the world and your family, ready
[1:11:20] to protect, ready to defend your family.
[1:11:23] You should be the one who is able to
[1:11:26] deal with finances. Now you may not be
[1:11:28] the check writer, the bill payer, but
[1:11:32] yet you realize you are the one who has
[1:11:34] the last say when it comes to handling
[1:11:36] finances. Now look, the leading cause of
[1:11:39] divorce in our world is
[1:11:41] finances. And one of the reasons why now
[1:11:44] you you don't you wouldn't know what I'm
[1:11:46] talking about here, but medical issues,
[1:11:48] medical costs are the things that drive
[1:11:50] most family to bankruptcy in America.
[1:11:53] And that causes financial or marital
[1:11:56] stress.
[1:11:57] building family unity, hard work and
[1:11:59] responsibility. I listen, I I had one of
[1:12:02] my boys went off to work at one of the
[1:12:04] grocery stores and he was the iron
[1:12:06] donkey man. You know, he went out in the
[1:12:07] parking lot and got those shopping carts
[1:12:10] and brought them all back inside in the
[1:12:12] winter and everything else. And one day
[1:12:13] I was in he worked in the grocery store
[1:12:15] for several several couple of years. And
[1:12:19] uh one day I was in the grocery store
[1:12:20] and the manager was in there, Mr. Alman.
[1:12:22] He came over to me. He said, "Hey, Mr.
[1:12:23] Coffee, got a second." And I said,
[1:12:25] "Yeah." He said,
[1:12:27] do you have any more sons? And I said,
[1:12:30] "Yeah, do you want
[1:12:31] them?" I I got three more. I said,
[1:12:34] "They're all on the block, you know, if
[1:12:35] you want them." And uh he said,
[1:12:38] "Hey, as soon as your other sons get of
[1:12:41] age, send them to me cuz if they're
[1:12:44] anything like him, we want them to
[1:12:46] work." As he said, we can't get kids to
[1:12:48] work. We can't get kids to, you know, if
[1:12:50] they're supposed to be here at 9:00 in
[1:12:52] the morning, they'll call in and say, "I
[1:12:54] don't think I can be there before 11
[1:12:55] because I have to renew my library
[1:12:58] card." And I, you know, he said, "They
[1:13:01] have no sense of responsibility." And he
[1:13:02] said, "We'll hire them Monday." And he
[1:13:04] said, "By Wednesday, they've quit
[1:13:06] because they You mean I have to work?
[1:13:09] You mean I have to actually do work?"
[1:13:11] And he said, "If you've got more kids
[1:13:13] and they're like this one, send them on.
[1:13:16] will hire because hard work and
[1:13:19] responsibility are something that
[1:13:21] parents need to teach their children.
[1:13:23] Here's a job. This is how you start.
[1:13:25] These are the tools you need. This is
[1:13:27] how this is how you do it. And let me
[1:13:29] know when you're completed. Everybody
[1:13:31] say that
[1:13:34] completed. And when we begin a job and
[1:13:37] complete the job, get paid for the job,
[1:13:40] we we we've simulated what real life is
[1:13:42] like. And it's important for parents to
[1:13:45] to practice that and to model that
[1:13:47] before their kids. I really like this
[1:13:49] statement by Spurgeon. Discernment is
[1:13:52] not knowing the difference between right
[1:13:53] and wrong. It's knowing the difference
[1:13:55] between right and almost
[1:13:58] right. Matthew 24. If any man shall say
[1:14:00] unto you, lo, here is Christ or there
[1:14:02] believe it not. For there shall arise
[1:14:03] false Christs, there shall arise false
[1:14:06] Christs and false prophets and show
[1:14:08] great signs and wonders in so much that
[1:14:10] if it were possible they shall deceive
[1:14:12] the very elect. If there's any time in
[1:14:14] history where we need to practice
[1:14:16] excellent discernment, it's now. You
[1:14:19] need to discern who your children's
[1:14:20] friends are, what activities they're a
[1:14:22] part of, what goes on in your house,
[1:14:24] what comes into your house. And now
[1:14:26] there's all kinds of ways for things to
[1:14:28] come into your house. And you have to be
[1:14:29] sure that you have uh you know, the
[1:14:31] right uh the right discernment here. And
[1:14:33] you need to teach your kids as well how
[1:14:35] to exercise excellent discernment
[1:14:37] because they're going to need it. and
[1:14:39] things are going to get more and more
[1:14:40] narrow and more close and more deceptive
[1:14:42] all the time. So, they need to have
[1:14:43] that, right? Things look good, not
[1:14:45] always good. And so, the kids need to be
[1:14:47] able to flag that because you kids grow
[1:14:49] up to a and come to a place where you're
[1:14:51] not going to be with your mom and dad
[1:14:52] and the pastor is not going to be there
[1:14:54] and nobody else is going to be there and
[1:14:56] you're going to have to make a
[1:14:57] choice and you're going to have to make
[1:14:59] good choices and some of those choices
[1:15:01] you're going to have to stand alone and
[1:15:02] that's tough like Daniel. All right. So,
[1:15:04] as a father then you got a job. Now, you
[1:15:07] say, "But brother Barry, I'm just a guy
[1:15:08] who sits in a pew. I don't even sing
[1:15:10] specials." That's all right. I never
[1:15:11] did. I've never sung a special in my
[1:15:13] life. But let me say this. I found this
[1:15:16] quote and I thought it was interesting.
[1:15:17] Perseverance. Little David, no doubt,
[1:15:20] raised in a lovely believing home. Stop.
[1:15:23] I thought, "Wow, if David was such a
[1:15:27] special person, Sister Marie, if if
[1:15:29] David was such a special person, I said
[1:15:31] I said don't be reading on." You were
[1:15:33] reading on. I saw you. If if David was
[1:15:36] such a special man and a man after God's
[1:15:38] own heart, who would God give David to
[1:15:43] to raise
[1:15:44] him?
[1:15:45] Huh? That's a good thought. And I I
[1:15:49] I then Jesse must have been some sort of
[1:15:52] a special guy because he's raising a man
[1:15:55] after God's own heart. He's the only one
[1:15:57] who's called a man after God's own
[1:15:59] heart. David,
[1:16:01] right? Now, watch what he says. Little
[1:16:03] David, no doubt raised in a lovely
[1:16:04] believing home. His father, Jesse, a
[1:16:06] great man of God.
[1:16:10] Stop. Does anybody know why you'd call
[1:16:13] Jesse a great man of God? Has he did he
[1:16:15] ever win any battles? Did he ever slay
[1:16:18] any giants? Was he ever a king? Do we
[1:16:22] hear about anything Jesse ever did after
[1:16:25] this? No. But yet, here's a prophet
[1:16:28] calling him a great man of God. That got
[1:16:30] my attention. That's why it's
[1:16:31] underlined.
[1:16:33] He says, "Jesse, a great man of God, no
[1:16:36] doubt gathered all the boys around at
[1:16:38] night and had family prayer before they
[1:16:40] went to
[1:16:42] bed." That's what made him a great man
[1:16:45] of God. He had devotions at
[1:16:47] night.
[1:16:49] Huh? Probably read the
[1:16:52] scrolls, talked about great Jehovah, how
[1:16:54] he opened up the Red Sea and the great
[1:16:56] prophet Moses and brought them out
[1:16:58] pillar of fire. And you know what that
[1:17:00] did? that created
[1:17:03] faith in the heart of
[1:17:07] David. So Jesse is called a great man of
[1:17:10] God because he had devotions at night.
[1:17:13] Huh? You thought he, you know, he's
[1:17:15] going to be a giant slayer or some sort
[1:17:17] of a warrior or a leader, a missionary.
[1:17:21] Nope. He held devotions at night with
[1:17:24] all of these boys. So he gets them
[1:17:25] around. All right, guys. Come on.
[1:17:26] Bedtime. Oh, dad, we don't want to go.
[1:17:28] All right, guys. It's bedtime. You got
[1:17:30] school tomorrow morning. Oh, Dad, give
[1:17:34] us one story. No, too late. Dad, give us
[1:17:36] one story. All right, just one. What do
[1:17:38] you want to hear? Moses crossing the Red
[1:17:41] Sea, Adam in the garden. What do you
[1:17:44] want to hear? Oh, tell us the story.
[1:17:47] Tell us the story about Joshua going
[1:17:50] around the walls. All right, everybody,
[1:17:53] grab your seat. So, Jesse, now you have
[1:17:55] to do this age appropriate, right? Like
[1:17:57] if you got if you got little ones, you
[1:18:00] don't put on future home and let have
[1:18:02] everybody listen to that for three and a
[1:18:04] half hours right before they go to bed,
[1:18:06] right? Starting in the beginning. Good
[1:18:09] evening, friends. Wait, we don't do
[1:18:11] that. So, what I did, I mean, I got up
[1:18:14] and acted it out because I'm a little
[1:18:16] graphic in my way and and uh I I with my
[1:18:19] boys, I got up and acted it out, you
[1:18:20] know, Goliath and and uh you
[1:18:24] know, you know, all of that. But here's
[1:18:27] Jesse, and he says, "All right, boys."
[1:18:29] He said, "There was a time when Joshua
[1:18:31] was crossing the Jordan River and went
[1:18:34] through the river and all the water
[1:18:35] stood still." And all you imagine little
[1:18:37] David, now David's the youngest, right?
[1:18:39] And David's a little guy. Wow.
[1:18:43] And nobody tells it like that. And and
[1:18:46] he's listening to that and he's
[1:18:47] thinking, "Wow, that's the Israelites
[1:18:49] are crossing the river. Wow." And and
[1:18:51] they go over and they march around the
[1:18:54] city and they got uh uh trumpets and
[1:18:57] they have uh you know, oh they they
[1:19:00] learn to shout and Jesse had all the
[1:19:02] boys shout. probably got them in a line
[1:19:04] and, you know, walk get in line, boys.
[1:19:05] And they walked around seven times
[1:19:07] around the bedroom or the living room
[1:19:09] and then they all shouted before they
[1:19:11] went to bed, right? You can imagine,
[1:19:13] hey, listen, you you you fill in what
[1:19:15] you want, but here's a prophet saying
[1:19:17] that Jesse was a great man of God. And
[1:19:20] David got to thinking on
[1:19:22] that. David got to thinking on
[1:19:25] that. My father read the scrolls. As
[1:19:28] here's David out tending the sheep,
[1:19:30] right? He's a young guy, not even shaven
[1:19:32] yet, and he's out he's out tending the
[1:19:34] sheep and a line comes up and he and he
[1:19:36] looks at this and he says, "My father
[1:19:38] read from the scrolls and told me that
[1:19:40] God God was a great God to deliver his
[1:19:43] people and I'm one of them and I have a
[1:19:45] right and I'm going after that sheep."
[1:19:46] And he grabbed his slingshot and brought
[1:19:48] that sheep back by killing the lion. He
[1:19:50] was persevering. He was persevering. And
[1:19:53] where did that come from? Where did
[1:19:54] where did David come up with that idea?
[1:19:57] He came up with that idea because as a
[1:19:59] young lad he was influenced by his
[1:20:01] father who was a great man of God. I'm
[1:20:04] only telling you what the tapes
[1:20:05] say training him once. That word is once
[1:20:10] he took his brother something to eat and
[1:20:12] there was a Goliath saying why don't
[1:20:13] Saul go out there and he got very
[1:20:15] perseverant and he took his slingshot
[1:20:17] and won the victory. The Bible says that
[1:20:19] when David went out on that field he ran
[1:20:22] out. He ran out. And the reason you run
[1:20:25] out on the field after a guy like uh
[1:20:28] like Goliath is because you have
[1:20:30] confidence. Listen, you have confidence
[1:20:33] that God means what he says and says
[1:20:35] what he means. Now, God never told David
[1:20:38] to go out there in that field. God never
[1:20:40] told David to go out and fight Goliath.
[1:20:42] But here's what God told David. You are
[1:20:44] going to be the next king. You are going
[1:20:46] to be the next king of Israel. And he
[1:20:49] took Samuel and anointed David and
[1:20:52] anointed him to be the next king. And
[1:20:54] David knew that if God said, "I'm going
[1:20:57] to be the next I'm going to be the next
[1:20:58] king of Israel, then if Goliath kills me
[1:21:01] on that field, God will have to raise me
[1:21:03] up because God's word cannot fail."
[1:21:08] And that's why he ran out there on the
[1:21:10] field because he knew that if God made a
[1:21:13] promise to him, it will come to pass
[1:21:15] exactly as God said. Where did he get
[1:21:17] that kind of faith at 15, 16 years old?
[1:21:20] It's because he had a father who had
[1:21:22] devotions at
[1:21:24] nighttime. You want to be a great man of
[1:21:28] God? Just saying. All right. In our
[1:21:32] house, we had a rule. The rule was there
[1:21:34] are three reasons that you get a
[1:21:36] spanking. Only three. And here's what
[1:21:39] they were. You kids, listen up. Number
[1:21:43] one was telling lies. And the and the
[1:21:45] reason is because Ephesians 4:25 says,
[1:21:47] "Wherefore put putting away lying." So
[1:21:49] if we caught our kids telling a lie,
[1:21:52] that was grounds for discipline. Number
[1:21:54] two, if they destroyed somebody's
[1:21:56] property. So in other words, if I take
[1:21:58] your bike and I uh, you know, jab it
[1:22:00] with a knife and and slash your tires,
[1:22:03] I'm destroying property. And in real
[1:22:05] life, I'm going to suffer consequences
[1:22:07] if I do that. So we trained our
[1:22:10] boys to not destroy somebody else's
[1:22:13] property. That was the second reason
[1:22:15] they got a spanking. And this is Psalm
[1:22:18] 119. David said, "I'll meditate in thy
[1:22:20] precepts and have respect unto thy
[1:22:21] ways." Respect. Respect is a very
[1:22:24] important thing. And when we teach our
[1:22:26] children respect, we're teaching them a
[1:22:27] great thing. And I will tell you this,
[1:22:28] parents, grandparents, if you teach your
[1:22:30] children any one thing and they only get
[1:22:32] one thing, teach them to respect the
[1:22:34] Bible. Because if they respect the
[1:22:36] Bible, God will bless them. Even if they
[1:22:39] disagree and they run away and do
[1:22:41] squirrely things, God will respect them
[1:22:44] if they respect the
[1:22:46] Bible. Number three, the third reason
[1:22:48] would be disrespect. Like things
[1:22:52] like, "No, I'm not going to do it." Or
[1:22:55] even if they don't say the words, but
[1:22:56] they roll their eyes. All right, guys.
[1:22:59] We got company coming. We need to clean
[1:23:01] the house. That's the only time really
[1:23:02] you clean the house thoroughly, right?
[1:23:03] Is when you have company coming. And if
[1:23:07] you're that's
[1:23:09] disrespect and you don't want to do that
[1:23:12] because the Bible says children obey
[1:23:14] your parents in all things. All the kids
[1:23:17] say all things. Nobody said it. All kids
[1:23:20] say this all things. Let's try it again.
[1:23:24] All things.
[1:23:28] Now, Brother Manam said, "Mother, if
[1:23:31] your child was out there in the street
[1:23:33] and them renegades were out there
[1:23:34] running through the street, that kid's
[1:23:35] going to get killed." He
[1:23:39] said, you would say, and and and you
[1:23:42] would say, "Well, darling, just go ahead
[1:23:45] and sit in the street. Guess that'll be
[1:23:46] all right. Whatever whatever you want to
[1:23:48] do, because I don't want to influence I
[1:23:50] don't want to affect your
[1:23:52] self-esteem." Brother Man said, "You
[1:23:54] wouldn't love your baby if you acted
[1:23:55] like that." real love would get out
[1:23:57] there, discipline that child, spank it
[1:24:00] until it got out of the street there.
[1:24:01] And he says, "Don't be angry with me."
[1:24:03] That's that's common sense would tell
[1:24:04] you that, right? Common sense would tell
[1:24:06] you. So, Brother Ram says, "If you if
[1:24:08] you really love your child, you're going
[1:24:09] to exercise appropriate discipline." And
[1:24:12] I need to say appropriate discipline
[1:24:13] because some people need to understand
[1:24:16] that discipline should always be
[1:24:18] appropriate and it should be age
[1:24:20] appropriate. And we could have more
[1:24:22] discussion about that, but but it should
[1:24:25] be appropriate for sure because
[1:24:27] discipline is not
[1:24:31] abuse.
[1:24:33] Right now, Brother Brandham says again,
[1:24:36] 1955, well, I'll ming I'll ming it a
[1:24:38] little bit. You say, well, I'll mingle
[1:24:40] mingle around in the world a little bit
[1:24:42] with my buddies and I'll I'll, you know,
[1:24:44] dance over the line and dance back. God
[1:24:46] will give you a real old-fashioned
[1:24:48] spanking for that. And if we had more of
[1:24:50] that in the natural today, we'd have
[1:24:51] better
[1:24:52] children. God wants Don't assume. Don't
[1:24:56] assume because your kids come to this
[1:24:58] church, they're going to turn out
[1:25:00] okay. Don't assume that uh because they
[1:25:04] know the message and they know who
[1:25:05] brother Brandon was that they're going
[1:25:06] to turn out okay. They're not because
[1:25:09] we're all born in sin, shaped in
[1:25:11] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[1:25:15] lies. Brother Brandham said, "My father
[1:25:17] used to give me whipping. I respect
[1:25:18] every whipping he ever gave me and I
[1:25:20] never uh he said I never even got as
[1:25:22] many as I needed and though he didn't do
[1:25:24] right himself yet he wanted me to do
[1:25:28] right. So it it is it is a discipline is
[1:25:32] very much a part of uh the fatherhood of
[1:25:35] God appropriate discipline because God
[1:25:37] never god never abuses when he
[1:25:40] disciplines. Matter of fact, I could say
[1:25:41] this that whenever God has corrected me,
[1:25:44] I've loved him more after it than
[1:25:48] before. And that's the way discipline
[1:25:50] should be. Okay? So, your children
[1:25:52] should never fear their parents. They
[1:25:55] should never fear their parents. All
[1:25:57] right? Let me give you an
[1:25:59] example. I found this. I thought it'd be
[1:26:01] good for me to read to you here. Once
[1:26:03] upon a time, this is a little story.
[1:26:04] It's only two screens long. Once upon a
[1:26:05] time, there was a family of wayward
[1:26:07] church members who had once been active
[1:26:10] but lost all interest and had fallen
[1:26:12] away. There was a father and three sons,
[1:26:14] Jim, John, and Sam. The elders had
[1:26:17] talked to them about their lost
[1:26:19] condition. The preacher visited many
[1:26:22] brethren talked to them about their lost
[1:26:23] condition and tried to get them to come
[1:26:26] back to church. But all this didn't do
[1:26:28] the least bit of good.
[1:26:31] One day when all the boys were out in
[1:26:32] the pasture a large rattlesnake bit John
[1:26:35] and he became critically ill. The doctor
[1:26:38] was called and after examination he
[1:26:40] pronounced John to be in a very critical
[1:26:42] condition and said he about all we can
[1:26:45] do now is pray. The father called a
[1:26:48] preacher told him of John's condition
[1:26:50] and he asked the preacher to pray for
[1:26:52] John's
[1:26:53] recovery. And this was his prayer.
[1:26:56] Oh wise and righteous father, we thank
[1:26:59] thee for thou and thy wisdom has sent
[1:27:02] this rattlesnake to bit bite John. And
[1:27:05] in order to bring him to his
[1:27:06] senses in order to bring him to his
[1:27:08] senses, he has not been inside the
[1:27:10] church for years. And it is doubtful
[1:27:13] that he has in all this time felt the
[1:27:15] need for prayer. But now we trust that
[1:27:17] this will be a valuable lesson to him
[1:27:19] and that it will lead him to genuine
[1:27:21] repentance.
[1:27:23] And now, Father, wilt thou send another
[1:27:26] snake to bite Sam, and another one to
[1:27:28] bite Jim, and another big one to bite
[1:27:31] the old man? And we, this is the prayer,
[1:27:34] but we have all, we have all been doing
[1:27:36] everything we know for years to try to
[1:27:37] restore them, but to no avail. And it
[1:27:40] seems like all of our combined efforts
[1:27:41] could not do what this snake has done.
[1:27:43] We conclude that the only thing left
[1:27:45] that will do this family any good is
[1:27:47] rattlesnakes. So Lord, send us bigger
[1:27:49] and better rattlesnakes. In the name of
[1:27:51] Jesus, we
[1:27:54] pray. I I say that because God's not
[1:27:57] afraid to use circumstances to get your
[1:28:00] attention. He's not afraid to use the
[1:28:03] circumstances of life around you to make
[1:28:05] you think uh differently about your
[1:28:08] situation. But how about when things go
[1:28:11] wrong and and they go they go they turn
[1:28:13] out in a way that you didn't expect? How
[1:28:16] about when that happens?
[1:28:18] Well, we need to think about this
[1:28:20] subject of reconciliation. Now, maybe
[1:28:21] you have um I you know your your family
[1:28:25] situation here. Uh people you know, even
[1:28:28] people you work with, people you once
[1:28:31] were close to and are now not close to.
[1:28:33] How do we reconcile things together?
[1:28:35] Now, I'll have to go quickly here, but
[1:28:37] let's deal with this subject of rec
[1:28:39] reconciliation.
[1:28:41] In Proverbs chapter 18, Solomon says,
[1:28:43] "The spirit of a man will sustain his
[1:28:45] infirmity. But a wounded spirit, who can
[1:28:48] bear?" Very often, very often,
[1:28:51] differences come because somebody's
[1:28:53] spirit got
[1:28:55] wounded. It it it's like a splinter in
[1:28:58] your hand. When you get a splinter and
[1:29:00] you do woodworking and you get a
[1:29:01] splinter, the splinter is fairly
[1:29:04] insignificant and it's really small and
[1:29:08] it really doesn't matter too much in the
[1:29:10] first couple of days, but leave it
[1:29:13] there and after a while you start to
[1:29:16] notice it. And then leave it there a
[1:29:18] little bit longer and you really start
[1:29:19] to notice it. And after a while, you're
[1:29:23] probably going to need some professional
[1:29:25] help to get that splinter out.
[1:29:28] That's like a wounded spirit. It it's
[1:29:31] somebody who there might be I don't know
[1:29:35] things can be said even in the pulpit.
[1:29:37] Things can be said you know in family
[1:29:39] circles and and things can be said they
[1:29:41] might not seem to you like much but it
[1:29:44] can be like a little splinter to
[1:29:46] somebody that it just fers and grows.
[1:29:49] But people do get offended. We get
[1:29:51] offended. Our spirit gets offended and
[1:29:52] we begin to draw back. How do we
[1:29:54] reconcile that? How do we deal with
[1:29:56] that? Well, let's look at what
[1:29:57] reconciliation is. All right. Reconc For
[1:30:00] it pleased the father. Colossians
[1:30:01] chapter 1. That in him should all
[1:30:04] fullness dwell. And having and having
[1:30:07] made peace through the blood of his
[1:30:09] cross by him to reconcile all things
[1:30:12] unto himself. And that word reconcile
[1:30:15] there in the Greek it means to bring
[1:30:16] back to a former state of harmony. So
[1:30:19] this is someone that you had harmony
[1:30:21] with at some point but but it's been
[1:30:24] broken. And when we say reconcile, like
[1:30:28] the Bible talks about, we're talking
[1:30:30] about bringing two people back
[1:30:33] together kind of like they were in a
[1:30:35] former state or in a former
[1:30:37] way. Now, we we may not be best of
[1:30:41] buddies, but we're at least we're not
[1:30:43] the best
[1:30:46] enemies.
[1:30:47] Okay? So, we're we're we're bringing
[1:30:50] this back towards more of what we call
[1:30:52] harmony. And Paul goes on to say, "By
[1:30:56] him, I say, whether they be things in
[1:30:57] earth or things in heaven, and you that
[1:31:00] were sometime alienated and enemies in
[1:31:03] your mind by wicked works, yet now hath
[1:31:05] he
[1:31:06] reconciled." So Jesus actually worked
[1:31:09] hard to reconcile people who were
[1:31:12] enemies. And they were people who were
[1:31:15] alienated from the family of God. And he
[1:31:19] died. He paid a great price. He shed his
[1:31:21] blood on the cross. It says, "In order
[1:31:23] to bring things back into a state of
[1:31:25] harmony." Aren't you glad he
[1:31:27] did you? Come on, folks. All of you are
[1:31:31] are the result of God's effort to
[1:31:33] reconcile. You wouldn't be you wouldn't
[1:31:35] be able to call him father. You wouldn't
[1:31:37] be able to call him bridegroom. You
[1:31:38] wouldn't be able to call him lord had he
[1:31:40] not reconciled you on the cross and paid
[1:31:42] the
[1:31:43] price. And so, your harmony with God is
[1:31:46] a result of what Jesus did in this whole
[1:31:49] process of reconciliation.
[1:31:52] Now we find in Psalm 119, teach me good
[1:31:55] judgment and knowledge, for I have
[1:31:57] believed thy commandments, and before I
[1:31:58] was afflicted, I went astray, but now I
[1:32:01] have kept thy word. So now I'm I'm back
[1:32:04] now, Lord, and I'm I'm sensitive to your
[1:32:07] word, and thou art good and do us good,
[1:32:09] and teach me thy statutes. David said, I
[1:32:11] want to know. Now, David knew what it
[1:32:13] was like to fall out of harmony with
[1:32:15] God.
[1:32:16] Right. Right. David knew what it was
[1:32:19] like to fall out of harmony with God.
[1:32:21] But God through his mercy forgives
[1:32:24] David. Now David's attitude is like,
[1:32:27] "Lord, you're good." Not me, but you're
[1:32:30] good. Teach me thy way. Show me so that
[1:32:34] I never fall into that position again.
[1:32:38] Whatever it takes, I want to know. The
[1:32:41] proud have forged a lie against me, but
[1:32:43] I will keep thy precepts with my whole
[1:32:46] heart. And and that's what uh that's
[1:32:48] what David that's the place David had to
[1:32:51] come to. And I'll guarantee you
[1:32:52] reconciliation happens a lot faster when
[1:32:55] people humble themselves and they come
[1:32:58] back off their high position. I'm right.
[1:33:00] No. Well, you know what? Sometimes we
[1:33:02] both need to go to the cross. Sometimes
[1:33:05] we both need to say, "Look, I I did that
[1:33:08] the other day to one of my sons and they
[1:33:09] said something to me and I
[1:33:14] I ever hear Uncle Mark do
[1:33:18] that
[1:33:19] and I reacted that way and then he
[1:33:22] apologized right away and I said, "Hey,
[1:33:24] I overreacted.
[1:33:26] Sorry." And and we got it back because
[1:33:29] you know what? I know enough to know,
[1:33:31] been around the block long enough to
[1:33:33] know that you could
[1:33:36] easily offend somebody or wound
[1:33:38] somebody's spirit by reacting the wrong
[1:33:42] way. And I I never we never want to have
[1:33:45] that. So I I I immediately call them up
[1:33:48] on the phone and we got we got it worked
[1:33:50] out. Bang. We moved on. Because let me
[1:33:53] tell you, the devil is is is quick to
[1:33:55] find little spots like that and get in
[1:33:57] there. He absolutely will. And this is
[1:34:00] what this means. This is not lofty
[1:34:02] spiritual things very often. These are
[1:34:03] like day-to-day things that you run into
[1:34:05] in your household and in your life.
[1:34:06] Brother Brham says, "Come back to a
[1:34:07] land. Come back to be gentle. Come back
[1:34:09] now to know nothing. Come back to just
[1:34:11] submit yourself to Christ and don't try
[1:34:13] to know
[1:34:14] nothing." You remember brother Brandham,
[1:34:16] you know, in that remember that uh if
[1:34:19] incident that he has when the when the
[1:34:21] girl drowns, remember that? and uh you
[1:34:24] know she she she uh she's revived and
[1:34:27] then she lives three more years and then
[1:34:29] she goes to the hospital and she tells
[1:34:31] her mother, "Mother, I'm going home."
[1:34:32] And she says, "Yeah, I know. The
[1:34:33] doctor's going to release you." And she
[1:34:34] said, "No, no, I'm going home." And 24
[1:34:36] hours later, she's
[1:34:38] dead. And brother Brandham, Brother
[1:34:40] Brandham knows this case, knows the
[1:34:42] family, and goes to God and says, "You
[1:34:43] owe me an
[1:34:45] explanation." I'll give you a little
[1:34:47] piece of advice. Don't ever go to God
[1:34:48] and tell God that he he owes you
[1:34:50] anything.
[1:34:52] That's not a good thing to do. And
[1:34:55] brother Brandham said, God, let him sit
[1:34:56] there a long time. This is a prophet.
[1:34:58] Let him sit there a long time. Until
[1:35:00] Brother Brandham realized, I I I would
[1:35:03] never do that again. He says, just walk
[1:35:05] me, humbly, quietly, gently, and the
[1:35:09] dove will lead you. Whenever you go to
[1:35:11] listening to gossip, get that temper up
[1:35:13] and so forth, you ever go to thinking
[1:35:14] that you got a right to do this and
[1:35:15] that, the dove will just take its flight
[1:35:18] and go another way.
[1:35:21] So therefore you have to be diligent.
[1:35:24] You have to look diligently lest any man
[1:35:26] fail of the grace of God and lest any
[1:35:28] root or bitterness spring up trouble you
[1:35:29] and thereby many be
[1:35:31] defiled. Some people stay away because
[1:35:34] they have a root of
[1:35:36] bitterness. Some people stay away
[1:35:38] because they have a root of bitterness
[1:35:40] and that root has grown up between
[1:35:42] people and it prevents them from having
[1:35:45] any kind of harmony.
[1:35:47] But everybody has to respond to hurt.
[1:35:50] And we either forgive somebody who says
[1:35:53] something or we overlook what somebody
[1:35:55] says or we realize that what they said
[1:35:58] was actually not wrong in the first
[1:36:01] place. And sometimes the truth
[1:36:06] hurts. So the Bible says in Proverbs 19,
[1:36:09] the discretion of a man defers his
[1:36:11] anchor anger. And the word discretion,
[1:36:14] it means in the Hebrew to delay. And it
[1:36:18] means the the good sense or the good
[1:36:20] wisdom that a man has sometimes is just
[1:36:23] to delay his delay his anger. So there
[1:36:26] are times when you feel like lashing out
[1:36:28] and responding in anger. And that's
[1:36:31] always not the best
[1:36:33] approach. If your child's in the middle
[1:36:36] of the street, that's one thing. But in
[1:36:37] a conversation there are sometimes you
[1:36:40] need to step back and think about
[1:36:43] that. And he goes on to say, "And it is
[1:36:46] his glory to pass over a transgression."
[1:36:48] Look, husbands and wives sometimes, you
[1:36:50] know, they get into a conversation and
[1:36:52] all of a sudden the temperature goes up
[1:36:53] and the volume goes up
[1:36:56] and and sometimes the discretion or the
[1:36:59] wisdom of a man says, "I'll talk to you
[1:37:01] about that later."
[1:37:04] not here at the dinner table with all
[1:37:05] the family here. But I'll just we'll
[1:37:08] we'll talk about that later. And
[1:37:10] sometimes that's the wisdom that we need
[1:37:12] to have because there's a time and a
[1:37:15] place to discuss
[1:37:17] everything. Now again, now these are not
[1:37:20] lofty spiritual things. More these are
[1:37:22] more of the practical day-to-day things
[1:37:24] that we go through and it's important
[1:37:27] for us to uh keep that in mind.
[1:37:31] Now David or sorry, Matthew says, "Ye
[1:37:34] have heard that it was said by them of
[1:37:35] old time, thou shalt not kill, and
[1:37:37] whosoever shall kill." Who and whosoever
[1:37:40] shall kill be in danger of the judgment.
[1:37:42] But I say unto you, now look, pause for
[1:37:45] a
[1:37:46] second and just remember that in Matthew
[1:37:49] chapter 5, Jesus uses two examples
[1:37:54] here of explaining Old Testament law.
[1:37:59] Now, Old Testament law was divided into
[1:38:01] three categories. Okay? The moral law,
[1:38:05] thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not
[1:38:06] commit adultery. That's the moral law.
[1:38:08] All the commandments can fit into one of
[1:38:10] these three categories. First one is the
[1:38:12] moral law. Second one is the dietary
[1:38:15] laws. So, thou shalt thou shalt not eat
[1:38:17] this, thou shalt not eat that and uh
[1:38:20] swine and so forth, you know, you you
[1:38:23] you don't eat that. And those moral
[1:38:25] those sorry those dietary laws were done
[1:38:27] away with at
[1:38:29] Calvary. And the other category of law
[1:38:32] is ceremonial law. When thou gather us
[1:38:35] together, the high priest shall wear
[1:38:37] this, sprinkle this, he shall bring
[1:38:39] this, he shall burn this. Those are all
[1:38:41] ceremonial laws. Those two were done
[1:38:44] away with in Calvary at Calvary. So we
[1:38:47] don't bring turtle doves to church
[1:38:48] anymore and kill them. And we don't, you
[1:38:50] know, bring heers and kill them anymore.
[1:38:53] But the moral law still exists. Right?
[1:38:56] Moral law still very much in in place
[1:38:59] now. Jesus in Matthew chapter 5, he
[1:39:02] comes along and he says that there's two
[1:39:03] I'll give you two examples of the moral
[1:39:05] law. And the first one here is
[1:39:07] anger. And he says, you have heard it
[1:39:10] said by them of old time. Thou shalt not
[1:39:13] kill.
[1:39:15] And by the
[1:39:17] way, if that was true in the English
[1:39:20] sense that we
[1:39:22] understand, no one, no Christian would
[1:39:24] ever be a
[1:39:25] soldier. But the Hebrew word on the in
[1:39:28] the on Mount Zion back there was, "Thou
[1:39:31] shalt not
[1:39:34] murder." Thou shalt not murder. And
[1:39:37] whosoever shall murder shall be in
[1:39:39] danger of the judgment. But I say unto
[1:39:41] you that whoever is angry with his
[1:39:43] brother without a cause shall be in
[1:39:46] danger of th of the judgment. And
[1:39:48] whosoever shall say to his brother,
[1:39:49] "Raqa," shall be in danger of the
[1:39:51] council. But whosoever shall say, "Thou
[1:39:53] fool," shall be in danger of hellfire.
[1:39:56] So Jesus takes the moral law about
[1:39:59] murder or killing and magnifies it to go
[1:40:02] beyond just the physical act of murder,
[1:40:04] but now he's talking about anger. Huh?
[1:40:10] Therefore, therefore, by the way, the
[1:40:12] other example he gives is
[1:40:16] lust. He says, you've heard it say that
[1:40:19] whosoever shall uh commit adultery, he
[1:40:21] shall also be in danger of judgment, so
[1:40:24] forth. But I say unto you, whosoever
[1:40:25] lookth upon a woman that lust after her.
[1:40:28] Right? In Matthew 5, those are the two
[1:40:31] examples, lust or or uh um adultery and
[1:40:36] anger. But now watch what he says in
[1:40:38] verse 23. Therefore, if thou, this this
[1:40:42] is how important this is. Therefore, if
[1:40:45] thou bring thy gift to the altar and
[1:40:47] their remembrance that thy brother has
[1:40:48] ought against thee. If you got an angry
[1:40:51] situation that exists between you and
[1:40:53] your brother or you and your
[1:40:55] sister, leave there thy gift and go thy
[1:40:59] way first. Be reconciled to thy brother
[1:41:02] and then come and offer thy gift.
[1:41:04] Listen.
[1:41:07] Reconciliation is above
[1:41:12] worship because you stop the worship and
[1:41:15] the offering of sacrifices and the
[1:41:17] giving of gifts. You stop that in order
[1:41:19] to reconcile
[1:41:21] first. Leave your gift at the altar.
[1:41:23] Just stop for a second. Go make that
[1:41:25] right. Now come back and offer the
[1:41:30] worship. This is kind of important,
[1:41:32] folks. And Jesus has got his big
[1:41:34] highlighter out there and he's
[1:41:36] highlighting this for us because he
[1:41:38] wants us to
[1:41:39] understand that reconciliation is an
[1:41:42] important thing because your worship
[1:41:43] means less to God when there's
[1:41:46] unreconciled situations that exist
[1:41:48] between husband and wife or brother and
[1:41:52] brother.
[1:41:54] Hello. So then offer that gift. Worship
[1:41:57] is still important but reconciliation is
[1:41:59] more important to God than worship is.
[1:42:05] Wow. I'm only telling you what the tapes
[1:42:08] say. Questions and
[1:42:11] answers. Questions and
[1:42:14] answers. The Bible says, this is what
[1:42:16] they ask brother Brandon, that
[1:42:17] everything works for the good to them
[1:42:19] that love the Lord. And if you love God
[1:42:21] and turn back to the
[1:42:23] world, will God let you die in your
[1:42:27] sins? or would he let you be reconciled
[1:42:30] back to him before he takes you away?
[1:42:33] Whoa. That is what we call a good
[1:42:36] question. That's why I have the asterisk
[1:42:38] up there in the first in front of the
[1:42:40] queue. My church knows that when there's
[1:42:42] an asterisk there, everybody kind of
[1:42:45] goes, now watch
[1:42:47] this. The Bible says that everything
[1:42:49] works together for good to them that
[1:42:51] love the Lord. Then if you love God and
[1:42:53] turn back to the
[1:42:56] world, would God let you die in your sin
[1:42:59] or would he let you be reconciled
[1:43:02] before he takes you away? Are you going
[1:43:04] to die in that unreconciled condition?
[1:43:07] Now, if you've got loved ones who you
[1:43:09] know that are not reconciled with God,
[1:43:11] listen to Brother Ram's answer because
[1:43:13] this is
[1:43:14] interesting. That's a really good
[1:43:16] question.
[1:43:18] Brother Brandham says, "Now,
[1:43:20] temporarily, every one of us backslide
[1:43:22] many times a day. We're all guilty."
[1:43:25] That's true. Remember, we're still human
[1:43:28] beings. But if you make a mistake and
[1:43:30] you don't willfully, but if you're a
[1:43:32] born again Christian, you don't mean to
[1:43:34] do wrong. Your intentions are right. But
[1:43:36] if you do make a mistake, will God let
[1:43:39] you just go on and die like that and be
[1:43:41] lost? Or will he bring you back to
[1:43:43] reconciliation? He will bring you back.
[1:43:50] that is worth coming to church for on a
[1:43:52] Wednesday night, he will the promise is
[1:43:55] he will bring you
[1:43:58] back.
[1:44:00] Wow. I would suggest to you if you have
[1:44:03] loved ones who they may they may have
[1:44:07] encountered the message they may what I
[1:44:09] don't where whatever whatever situation
[1:44:11] they're in. Look, you're not God and
[1:44:13] you're not their savior and you're not
[1:44:15] responsible for what goes on in their
[1:44:17] heart. But I would say, Lord, if if it's
[1:44:20] if it's possible, bring them back before
[1:44:23] they leave this earth so they might be
[1:44:25] reconciled at least into some sort of
[1:44:27] harmony with
[1:44:29] you. Because I'd rather be in harmony
[1:44:32] here before I leave than try to go and
[1:44:35] plead my case before God in the
[1:44:36] judgment.
[1:44:44] Wow, that's
[1:44:47] important. I I for my children, I' I'd
[1:44:50] want to apply that for people that I
[1:44:53] know. Uh and you know, for one reason or
[1:44:55] another, they might have started out
[1:44:57] well and then something happened or they
[1:44:59] were offended or something else. I' I'd
[1:45:02] rather I'd rather believe that somehow
[1:45:04] or another God's going to bring them
[1:45:05] back. Now, watch what he goes on to say.
[1:45:06] Same one. And if you do anything wrong
[1:45:09] and it don't condemn you and you go on
[1:45:10] like that, but remember you weren't
[1:45:12] saved at the beginning. If you can carry
[1:45:14] on like that, you weren't saved in the
[1:45:15] beginning. You just had to make believe.
[1:45:17] But when you're saved, you have a
[1:45:18] different spirit, different nature, new
[1:45:20] creature. Old things are passed away,
[1:45:21] dead and buried in the sea of his
[1:45:24] forgetfulness. But being living here in
[1:45:26] this world, there's traps set for you
[1:45:30] everywhere. And you're walking with your
[1:45:32] eyes on Christ. Remember, when you make
[1:45:34] a mistake, a real Christian always comes
[1:45:37] back for
[1:45:41] reconciliation. This applies to every
[1:45:43] one of
[1:45:45] us. Every one of us. Because we make
[1:45:48] mistakes. And there are things. Listen,
[1:45:50] I have prayed many, many times in my
[1:45:53] life. Lord, don't look at my conduct.
[1:45:56] Look at my
[1:45:58] heart. Because I don't want to make
[1:46:00] those kinds of mistakes. I I detest that
[1:46:02] kind of a mistake. I detest that kind of
[1:46:04] uh you know part of my personality.
[1:46:07] Lord, look at my heart. I want to be
[1:46:09] right. I want to I want to overcome
[1:46:10] this. I want to get beyond this. Lord,
[1:46:13] whatever it takes and and if this is
[1:46:15] what it is that keeps me on my knees and
[1:46:17] whatever, Lord, use it somehow. But I
[1:46:20] don't want to go in I don't want to go
[1:46:21] into eternity with that. And Lord, help
[1:46:23] me to overcome that. Look at my heart,
[1:46:25] not my
[1:46:29] conduct. Because we're all human.
[1:46:33] So you want to make reconciliation the
[1:46:36] goal and and this again is Matthew 18
[1:46:39] and Jesus talks about it again. If thy
[1:46:41] brother shall trespass against thee, go
[1:46:43] and tell him his fault between him and
[1:46:45] thee alone. And if he shall hear thee,
[1:46:46] thou has gained thy brother. This is the
[1:46:48] thing to do when there's a situation
[1:46:51] where there is something out of harmony.
[1:46:53] Look, someone's got to go. Someone's got
[1:46:55] to make the first step. Somebody's got
[1:46:57] to say, "Look, we got to get this right
[1:46:58] because we're not going to go into
[1:47:00] eternity this way." So, whatever it
[1:47:05] takes. Now, hold on before it gets too
[1:47:08] late
[1:47:11] here. Brother Brandham often often said
[1:47:14] this. He often described things this way
[1:47:16] and he was talking about prayer cloths
[1:47:18] and he said, "A little German woman uh
[1:47:21] confessed all of her faults." Now, the
[1:47:23] point brother Brand was making here is
[1:47:24] that in the first part on the top of the
[1:47:26] screen there, when you know that you can
[1:47:28] do something, when you know that you've
[1:47:30] got permission or you've got the
[1:47:32] go-ahehead to do something, do it and
[1:47:34] don't put it off. I'll pray about it and
[1:47:36] I'll wait till God speaks to me in a
[1:47:37] dream. Don't do that. Do it
[1:47:40] quickly. And he says, "This little
[1:47:42] German woman confessed all of her
[1:47:44] faults. And there's one thing you got to
[1:47:45] do is make things right with God because
[1:47:47] the affliction might be on you for that
[1:47:49] purpose is to bring you to God."
[1:47:51] I
[1:47:53] mean, God's ways are above our ways,
[1:47:55] right? His ways are not our ways.
[1:47:57] They're above our ways. And and she's
[1:48:00] been crippled with arthritis for 20
[1:48:02] years. And said, "All right, old man,
[1:48:04] devil. The he said, she said, "The works
[1:48:06] is done. So get away. Here I come." And
[1:48:09] she got up and walked out of the
[1:48:10] wheelchair. Just that simple. And that's
[1:48:12] the way we've got to believe it in that
[1:48:14] manner. In that manner. Just as simple
[1:48:16] as we can be. When God tells you to do
[1:48:19] something, act on it. Don't don't wait
[1:48:21] for uh you know uh approval or whatever
[1:48:25] else. If God's acting telling you to do
[1:48:27] something, act on it quickly and go do
[1:48:29] it. And and I believe that God will
[1:48:31] honor
[1:48:33] that. Now look, these are things that
[1:48:36] won't take place in heaven. You won't
[1:48:38] have to do this in heaven. This is stuff
[1:48:40] you do here before you get there.
[1:48:43] And and even to the point where Paul
[1:48:45] makes this very clear, God has
[1:48:48] reconciled us to himself by Christ and
[1:48:50] has given
[1:48:52] who?
[1:48:53] Us. God's given us the ministry of
[1:48:57] reconciliation. God's not given that to
[1:48:59] St. Peter at the
[1:49:01] gate. He's given that to us.
[1:49:06] And so therefore, we have the
[1:49:08] responsibility when we have an
[1:49:10] opportunity to reconcile or even I could
[1:49:13] say even when we have an opportunity to
[1:49:16] attempt to
[1:49:18] reconcile, you should do it because
[1:49:20] God's given you the responsibility to do
[1:49:24] it. In other words, nobody else is going
[1:49:27] to come. I mean, the government's not
[1:49:28] going to come.
[1:49:33] Nobody else in the church is probably
[1:49:34] going to come and and do that unless
[1:49:36] somehow they felt led. But if if you've
[1:49:38] got off between your brother, uh you
[1:49:41] know, Jesus doesn't say, "Hey, go pick
[1:49:43] five brothers in the church and go to
[1:49:44] that person first." He says, "You go to
[1:49:46] that person first." Now, if they don't
[1:49:48] hear you, he says, "Then you can take a
[1:49:50] couple back, you know, if there's an
[1:49:51] offense in the church and so on." And
[1:49:53] that's a rare thing, but it it does
[1:49:55] happen. But what he what he's telling us
[1:49:57] is that the ministry of
[1:50:00] reconciliation, everybody go like this.
[1:50:02] Take your finger and go like this.
[1:50:03] Everybody, if you everybody does it,
[1:50:05] nobody gets
[1:50:06] embarrassed and go like
[1:50:08] this. God's given us the ministry of
[1:50:12] reconciliation. So, I'm not waiting for
[1:50:14] someone else to come to me. I'm right.
[1:50:16] They need to come to me and apologize.
[1:50:18] Oh, hang on
[1:50:19] now. That may be how you feel. But
[1:50:22] that's not what the Bible
[1:50:24] says. The Bible says you leave your gift
[1:50:27] there. You leave your message books
[1:50:29] there and you go over and see what you
[1:50:32] can do. Now, you may not be able to, but
[1:50:33] you're going to at least attempt to
[1:50:35] reconcile with a sincere
[1:50:38] heart. The ministry of reconciliation is
[1:50:42] in the church because we're in the
[1:50:45] church. Again, brother Brandham says
[1:50:48] Abraham's out there telling a little
[1:50:49] white
[1:50:51] lie. This the kind of thing you put in
[1:50:54] brackets, but the little white ones are
[1:50:55] big black ones.
[1:50:58] Oh, that's my sister. He said to
[1:51:00] Aimilec. But God said, no matter who he
[1:51:04] was, no matter what Abraham did, he's my
[1:51:08] prophet, and I have given him the
[1:51:10] promise, called him by election, and I
[1:51:13] will deal with Abraham for that. But
[1:51:16] he's mine. You take his wife back or
[1:51:19] everything you got's going to die. You
[1:51:21] know what I'm talking about, right? He's
[1:51:24] going to take Sarah and he's he's got
[1:51:27] the clearance because Abraham lied and
[1:51:30] said that's my sister. Well, he was
[1:51:32] halfright because it was a half sister,
[1:51:34] right? So, he didn't want to lose his
[1:51:36] head. God knows the heart. And so, he
[1:51:38] goes to Aimilec because Aimilec, even
[1:51:41] though he's not a Jew and there's no
[1:51:44] such thing as a Christian back then,
[1:51:46] he's got a respect for the moral
[1:51:48] boundaries of the law. and he doesn't
[1:51:51] want to get found committing adultery
[1:51:53] back in that day. So, he's got clearance
[1:51:56] and brother Ram said he's brushing his
[1:51:57] teeth ready to, you know, ready to take
[1:51:59] this ready for the
[1:52:00] wedding. And God says to him, "Touch her
[1:52:03] and you're a dead man." Matter of fact,
[1:52:06] you give that woman back to Abraham
[1:52:07] because that's his wife. But, but, but I
[1:52:09] know what you're going to say, but you
[1:52:11] give back that woman back to Abraham and
[1:52:13] send him on his way and loan him one of
[1:52:15] your Cadillacs to get him back up there
[1:52:17] and fill it up with gas. them, by the
[1:52:19] way, write him a check and give him an
[1:52:21] offering. Now, that's my version of the
[1:52:23] Bible, but you can find that. And he
[1:52:26] says, you give him an offering and send
[1:52:27] him on his way and say, "God bless you.
[1:52:29] I'll deal with Abraham, but I'm I'm I'm
[1:52:31] actually saving your hide,
[1:52:35] Aimilec, but if you don't make this
[1:52:37] right, buddy, everything in your country
[1:52:39] is going to break out into something you
[1:52:42] don't
[1:52:43] want." And Brother Brandham said, he
[1:52:45] rose from there, grabbed that woman, and
[1:52:47] away he went. he's going to make things
[1:52:48] right, some restitution. So, he didn't
[1:52:50] wait and, you know, consult his gods or
[1:52:53] ask the wise men in the kingdom. He
[1:52:54] didn't do that. He knew he'd heard from
[1:52:56] God. Off he
[1:52:59] goes and he takes Sarah back to
[1:53:03] Abraham. Now, you in the prayer line,
[1:53:05] Brother said, "There's any unconfessed
[1:53:07] sin in your life, be aware it'll be
[1:53:08] worse than it'll be worse than ever if
[1:53:10] you come up here to be prayed for with
[1:53:13] unconfessed sin in your life." So
[1:53:15] sometimes you need to be reconciled to
[1:53:17] God, right? You need to be reconciled to
[1:53:19] one another or you need to be reconciled
[1:53:21] to God. You make things right. And if
[1:53:23] that's in your life, step out of the
[1:53:25] line. Listen to this. Step out of the
[1:53:27] line. Make that right. Come back in the
[1:53:29] line. What's more important?
[1:53:31] Reconciliation or healing of some fatal
[1:53:35] disease. I don't know. Maybe they got
[1:53:37] cancer. Maybe they got something that's
[1:53:38] serious wrong with them. Brother Bam
[1:53:40] says, "Hey, you want to get healed?
[1:53:42] Here's how you do it. You got
[1:53:43] unconfessed sin? Leave the healing right
[1:53:45] here at the altar. Go make it right and
[1:53:47] then come back and see what God
[1:53:50] does. That's the priority that God puts
[1:53:53] on
[1:53:54] reconciliation. How will the world know
[1:53:56] that you love love Jesus? When we love
[1:53:59] one
[1:54:00] another. God sees your faith and the
[1:54:03] world sees your action. Therefore, we
[1:54:05] should love one
[1:54:07] another. Hallelujah.
[1:54:13] I'm going to skip. You can have all of
[1:54:15] these
[1:54:17] uh all you can have all of these uh
[1:54:19] powerpoints when I'm
[1:54:26] done. Brother Brandham says in the
[1:54:28] message blind barnameus Jesus was
[1:54:30] walking on. He was walking on and the
[1:54:32] priests were screaming at him and making
[1:54:34] fun and others were saying uh hosana
[1:54:36] blessed be the uh blessed be the king
[1:54:38] who comes in the name of the Lord and so
[1:54:40] forth. And he's well coming into
[1:54:41] Jerusalem on a donkey, right? He's
[1:54:44] coming into Jerusalem on the donkey and
[1:54:47] people are yelling things at him and
[1:54:48] they're they're scoffing him and so
[1:54:50] forth. Other people are calling out
[1:54:53] hosana. But the whole burden of the
[1:54:55] world rested upon him and Calvary laid
[1:54:57] before him as he went, but he never
[1:54:59] noticed their scoffing.
[1:55:01] Listen, you know, when someone says
[1:55:03] something evil about you and you want to
[1:55:06] take it up and get angry about, I'll get
[1:55:08] even with him, that shows you haven't
[1:55:11] quite went deep enough with God
[1:55:14] yet. Now, for some of us, we had to
[1:55:17] really keep that whole thing under in
[1:55:19] prayer. We got to stay under it. Like
[1:55:21] Paul says, I I get under my body, keep
[1:55:23] it into subjection. And there are
[1:55:25] attributes that we all have that you've
[1:55:27] got to keep you got to get under that.
[1:55:28] You got to keep it in subjection because
[1:55:30] if you don't, it'll get away on you real
[1:55:32] quick because you know what? Hey, your
[1:55:34] body is not born
[1:55:36] again.
[1:55:40] Hello. It's still got all those old
[1:55:42] habits and all those old quirks. I was
[1:55:45] telling my wife the other day, Bob, hold
[1:55:47] out your hand. I was telling my wife the
[1:55:49] other
[1:55:50] day, let's see the other one. Huh?
[1:55:55] That's only because your wife told you
[1:55:56] to wash it. I got I got arthritis just
[1:55:59] like mom, you know, and and uh when mom
[1:56:03] pointed at you, she'd be pointing right
[1:56:05] at you like that and she'd be pointing
[1:56:06] that way, right? Because her fingers
[1:56:08] were all bent. Mine mine are getting
[1:56:10] like that, Sister Marine. And I noticed
[1:56:12] it's getting worse on this one over
[1:56:14] here. So now when I point at you, it's
[1:56:15] like I'm getting her down there.
[1:56:17] Yeah, there are natural things that you
[1:56:20] inherit. There are natural things that
[1:56:22] you inherit just because that's a
[1:56:24] natural succession in life. and you uh
[1:56:26] you you know you uh you there's natural
[1:56:29] things that that you pick up and you
[1:56:31] carry through life here. And brother
[1:56:33] Bram says with with your anger, he says
[1:56:36] when when somebody does that to you and
[1:56:38] triggers
[1:56:39] that he says you haven't quite went deep
[1:56:42] enough with God
[1:56:43] yet. And he said that's what made
[1:56:47] Jesus God to me. He had a work to do and
[1:56:51] that was to fulfill what God sent him to
[1:56:52] do. And he didn't care what anybody else
[1:56:53] said. So that's a victory when when
[1:56:56] somebody can, you know, people can be
[1:56:58] offensive and he doesn't take the
[1:57:00] offense. He lets it
[1:57:01] go. He lets it
[1:57:09] go. Now, let me let me I'll I'll stop.
[1:57:12] Let me tell you a little story. And some
[1:57:15] some of you from Arizona might know the
[1:57:17] background of Carl Williams, who was a
[1:57:19] friend of brother
[1:57:21] Green. And Carl Williams was
[1:57:24] u was a member of the full gospel
[1:57:26] businessman's association that was
[1:57:28] instrumental in in uh having venues that
[1:57:32] allowed brother Brandon to minister.
[1:57:34] Some of the best sermons we have of
[1:57:36] brother Brandham were preached at full
[1:57:38] gospel businessman's
[1:57:39] meetings and uh the treasurer of the
[1:57:42] full gospel businessman's association
[1:57:44] was Carl Williams. Carl was a big loud
[1:57:48] Texan. They say when he walked, he
[1:57:50] walked with a three-foot stride every
[1:57:53] step, three feet. And uh loud,
[1:57:59] big, wealthy, oil driller,
[1:58:03] successful, but he had a recurring
[1:58:06] infection in his nose. It was an odd
[1:58:09] thing, but he had an operation to fix
[1:58:12] that. And in that operation something
[1:58:15] was a nerve was affected and he became
[1:58:18] almost totally
[1:58:20] paralyzed and his stride was reduced
[1:58:23] from 3 feet to 6 in and he shuffled for
[1:58:26] most of the rest of his life and
[1:58:29] arthritis set in in a big
[1:58:32] way. And Carl Williams wife went to all
[1:58:36] of brother Bram's meetings. She was a
[1:58:38] faithful follower of brother Brandham
[1:58:39] and she went regularly. And so she said
[1:58:44] to Carl, "You should come to Brother
[1:58:45] Brandham's meetings and be prayed for."
[1:58:48] And when he went to the meeting, Brother
[1:58:50] Brandham made this statement. This is
[1:58:51] verbatim. If you believe, every one of
[1:58:54] you can be healed. If you believe, every
[1:58:56] one of you can be healed.
[1:59:02] Brother Carl Williams in that condition,
[1:59:05] he went to brother Brandham and he said
[1:59:06] to brother Brandham one day, he said,
[1:59:10] "You prayed for me and I believe, but
[1:59:13] I'm not healed." And he said, "I don't
[1:59:16] understand that."
[1:59:19] But in the time when Carl Williams was
[1:59:22] crippled like that, instead of working
[1:59:24] in the oil business, he worked as a
[1:59:27] treasure for the Full Gospel Businessman
[1:59:29] full-time and he traveled with Brother
[1:59:32] Brandham somewhat and he held the door
[1:59:35] open at the Full Gospel Businessman for
[1:59:38] 154 sermons of Brother Brandon to be
[1:59:40] preached in that venue.
[1:59:44] In
[1:59:45] 1963, Brother Carl was healed of that
[1:59:49] condition like normal. And when he did,
[1:59:53] he went right back into the oil
[1:59:55] business. Gave up his position, full
[1:59:56] gospel, went right back into the oil
[1:59:58] business, started making all kinds of
[2:00:00] money again.
[2:00:02] 1964, he has a relapse and he comes back
[2:00:06] crippled
[2:00:07] again. And he says to brother Brandham,
[2:00:10] "I don't
[2:00:11] understand. I don't understand at all."
[2:00:13] Brother Ram doesn't answer him. One day,
[2:00:16] Carl Williams is sitting in his pickup
[2:00:18] truck in the parking lot of the of the
[2:00:22] uh church out in Arizona where brother
[2:00:25] where brother Green has uh set up the
[2:00:27] church out there. He's sitting in the
[2:00:28] parking lot by himself. Brother Bram
[2:00:30] drives in the parking lot, rolls up his
[2:00:33] vehicle next to brother Williams and
[2:00:35] rolls down the window. He says, "Carl,"
[2:00:38] he says, "I want to tell you a story."
[2:00:40] He says there was
[2:00:42] a a story that was told he said back in
[2:00:45] the days of Rome when the Roman army had
[2:00:47] won a great battle had won a great
[2:00:49] victory and normally what happened then
[2:00:52] was all the people uh passed through the
[2:00:54] streets and the soldiers passed through
[2:00:56] the streets and all the people on the
[2:00:57] sidelines would applaud the soldiers and
[2:01:00] throw flowers at them and so forth and
[2:01:02] it was a big fanfare and uh Caesar would
[2:01:05] lead the army or the generals would lead
[2:01:07] the army and they would go through the
[2:01:09] streets like that and everybody
[2:01:10] applauded and hollered at the soldiers
[2:01:12] as they went by. And Caesar one day
[2:01:16] looked as he was going through the
[2:01:17] streets of Rome and he looked over and
[2:01:19] there was an old man who was crippled.
[2:01:21] He was sitting on the ground and Caesar
[2:01:24] says, "Why don't you stand when we pass
[2:01:26] by?" And the old man says, "Sir, I
[2:01:28] cannot I cannot use my legs." What
[2:01:29] happened to them? He says, "They got
[2:01:31] injured in a war." What war? He says, "A
[2:01:33] war that I fought on your behalf on
[2:01:35] behalf of Rome." He said, 'You mean you
[2:01:38] were injured in the in one of the
[2:01:39] battles for Rome?' And he said, 'Yes,
[2:01:40] sir, I was. I cannot stand. If I could,
[2:01:42] I would. And he said to a couple of
[2:01:44] soldiers near him, he said, "Take that
[2:01:46] man, pick him up, and put him in my
[2:01:48] chariot, and he'll ride with me the rest
[2:01:50] of the way."
[2:01:53] And brother Brandham looked at Carl
[2:01:54] Williams and he said,
[2:01:56] "Carl," he said, "when you were
[2:01:59] crippled, you did great things for the
[2:02:01] kingdom and for my ministry, but when
[2:02:04] you were healed, you went right back out
[2:02:06] in the business
[2:02:08] again." So he said, "God wants you to
[2:02:11] work for the kingdom for the rest of
[2:02:13] your life."
[2:02:15] He said, "So, Carl, you're meant to ride
[2:02:18] with me in my chariot for the rest of
[2:02:20] your
[2:02:21] days." And he said, "Carl just bowed his
[2:02:24] head and
[2:02:26] wept." Brother Carl Williams was never
[2:02:28] healed of that condition.
[2:02:30] After brother Brandham died, brother
[2:02:33] Perry Green took Carl Williams all over
[2:02:36] the world and they testified about
[2:02:38] Brother Ram's ministry and told the me
[2:02:41] the story of this message uh all in in
[2:02:45] countless numbers of countries. And
[2:02:47] there's many people in foreign lands
[2:02:49] today who believe this message because
[2:02:50] of the testimony of Carl Williams.
[2:02:54] Brother Anne said, "God caused you to
[2:02:58] come back and serve
[2:03:04] him." Let me just simply say
[2:03:08] this. We don't always understand God's
[2:03:12] ways. We don't always understand how God
[2:03:14] does things.
[2:03:16] But I do know this that if there are
[2:03:19] things that I can reconcile in my
[2:03:23] life, I should I should act on it
[2:03:26] because that's the only way I'm going to
[2:03:28] get shalom in my home. And sometimes
[2:03:31] that's the only way I'm going to get
[2:03:33] shalom in my
[2:03:35] home. Because your home is not
[2:03:37] necessarily just a place you eat and
[2:03:39] sleep. This is also your home, right?
[2:03:43] But there are things that God will do in
[2:03:46] order to keep you close to him that we
[2:03:48] may not
[2:03:50] understand. But the worst thing you want
[2:03:52] to do is to have a root of bitterness in
[2:03:55] your heart because things don't work out
[2:03:57] the way you think they should. Remember,
[2:04:00] God's in control. We're not in
[2:04:03] control. And God wants you to be
[2:04:05] reconciled to him. God wants you to be
[2:04:06] in the right place doing the right thing
[2:04:08] in his perfect will. That's exactly what
[2:04:11] God wants you to be doing.
[2:04:13] Let's stand and repeat our
[2:04:16] feet. David said in Psalm 147, "Praise
[2:04:19] ye the Lord, for it is good to sing
[2:04:21] praises unto our God, and it is pleasant
[2:04:24] and and praises comely. The Lord doth
[2:04:28] build up Jerusalem, and he gathered
[2:04:29] together the outcast of Israel." Look at
[2:04:31] what verse three says. He health the
[2:04:33] broken in heart, and bindeth up their
[2:04:36] wounds. God knows exactly what you're
[2:04:39] going through. He knows exactly the
[2:04:41] stress that you've been under. But he's
[2:04:43] a healer of broken
[2:04:46] hearts. He tellth the stars and he calls
[2:04:49] them all by
[2:04:51] name. God knows exactly how to bring
[2:04:53] this around. Bring it right so that you
[2:04:57] won't have to try to reconcile in glory
[2:04:59] some time somewhere up there. God wants
[2:05:01] you to do it here. Want you to do it the
[2:05:03] right way. He wants you to make it a
[2:05:05] priority. Leave things at the altar. Go
[2:05:08] make it right. come back and continue to
[2:05:10] worship
[2:05:11] God. But remember this, you might be
[2:05:13] sitting there tonight with a broken
[2:05:15] heart. You might be thinking, "Well,
[2:05:16] it'll never happen. It'll never happen."
[2:05:18] God knows exactly what's going on in
[2:05:20] your heart. He He numbers the stars. He
[2:05:22] knows them all by their name.
[2:05:26] What you've got to do is put your trust
[2:05:27] in him and say,
[2:05:28] "Lord, if if that's your will, then
[2:05:31] Lord, I'm asking for you to open up a
[2:05:32] way. Show me show me what I need to do.
[2:05:35] Help me to act. Help me to have the
[2:05:37] courage to act. Help me to have the will
[2:05:40] to
[2:05:42] forgive because the goal
[2:05:44] is shalom in the
[2:05:47] home. Let's pray. Sister Marine, if
[2:05:49] you'd play softly
[2:05:51] there. Let's pray
[2:05:53] together. Heavenly Father, we're so
[2:05:56] thankful, Lord, for this opportunity we
[2:05:58] had to be able to study your word. And
[2:06:01] as long as we human beings are on this
[2:06:03] earth, there going to be differences.
[2:06:04] There could only be things, Lord, that
[2:06:07] ways that we rub against one another,
[2:06:09] husbands and wives, brothers and
[2:06:11] sisters,
[2:06:13] co-workers,
[2:06:15] neighbors. There are things that happen,
[2:06:17] Lord, that we didn't plan. We didn't
[2:06:20] want it to be that way. But there are
[2:06:22] situations that exist that, oh, if we
[2:06:25] could, we'd we'd never let that happen
[2:06:29] again. But in some ways, we need to make
[2:06:32] these things right.
[2:06:34] And I'm asking Lord that in order for us
[2:06:37] to have shalom in the home, in our
[2:06:39] hearts, in our minds, that Lord, we
[2:06:44] would we would just be sensitive to your
[2:06:47] leading to act when we
[2:06:51] should speak
[2:06:55] with the right
[2:06:57] voice, be forgiving in our
[2:07:00] spirits, and to learn to let things So I
[2:07:04] pray you'd have your way,
[2:07:06] Lord. Have your way. And help us to know
[2:07:10] exactly when we should leave our gift at
[2:07:12] the altar and go and make things
[2:07:14] right. It's like you would have us to do
[2:07:16] it. Help us, Lord, right where we are.
[2:07:19] We need
[2:07:21] you. And we pray and ask these things in
[2:07:24] Jesus name and for your
[2:07:27] glory. Amen.
[2:07:31] And amen. Let's sing that song you're
[2:07:34] playing
[2:07:35] there. Do you know what that is?
[2:07:43] [Music]
