[38:24] [Music]
[38:48] praise him worthy the lamb that was
[38:51] slain and the special by our sister Lily
[38:54] and thank the Lord a man for the
[38:59] revelation of God in the beginning was
[39:02] the self existing one a man by the grace
[39:05] of God and and well I guess she can use
[39:11] her guitar again and is like the sister
[39:17] one time that was there and the service
[39:19] with her family she took her one of our
[39:21] children her boy out to punish him and
[39:24] to get to calm him down but she used the
[39:28] hymn book so some of the Brethren said I
[39:31] was praying for the hymn book not for
[39:35] the boy but for the hymn book and so
[39:39] we're praying for sister Lily's guitar
[39:41] oh that was excellent that was good a
[39:43] man and giving praise to God hallelujah
[39:47] the self-existing one and God looks for
[39:50] not just the praise of our voice but
[39:53] what would those that have that gift
[39:55] he's looking for the praise to praise
[39:58] him on the musical instruments a million
[40:00] because that they're going to have
[40:02] musical instruments in heaven they're
[40:04] going to have musical instruments in the
[40:05] kingdom of God when we're back here by
[40:08] the grace of God amen and maybe our
[40:12] sister Lily will be back here at the
[40:14] time still playing the guitar a man by
[40:18] the grace of God so the Lord blesses and
[40:21] for this fourth of specials and may it
[40:24] be a blessing to our hearts and our
[40:26] souls
[40:26] amen so God ever bless you and just to
[40:30] say that it's our pleasure not to delay
[40:32] too long and to welcome my brother
[40:36] Brandon kisser and sister kisser from
[40:40] Alberta a man and I assumed they would
[40:44] bring good weather but they were saying
[40:46] that they had snow so we hope that they
[40:49] left it behind and because we've had our
[40:53] we've had our share a mayor
[40:56] and and even though it's free heat well
[40:58] they can still keep it a man and I guess
[41:03] the only thing that we would take would
[41:04] be the 10% and and maybe an offering so
[41:10] the Lord bless brother Brandon and our
[41:12] sister kisser and we welcomed them back
[41:15] to Newfoundland and we enjoyed their
[41:17] ministry when they were here before a
[41:20] man it was a blessing to us and we pray
[41:23] that and believe that it'll be a
[41:25] blessing to us again tonight amen
[41:27] so we have invited our brother to take
[41:30] us you know as long as he wants
[41:32] so he'll be an hour hour laughs and as I
[41:36] told him before I said I said he was
[41:38] less than an hour and a half I would
[41:40] demand a refund from him so we won't do
[41:46] that tonight but we thank him for coming
[41:48] and especially with his physical
[41:52] condition but let's believe a man this
[41:56] is what we call Easter time and Easter
[41:59] is is it's not just the resurrection of
[42:02] our souls and the new birth it's the
[42:05] resurrection of our in the healing of
[42:07] our physical bodies remember he was
[42:10] wounded for our transgressions and he
[42:13] was bruised for our iniquities and the
[42:16] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[42:18] and with His stripes we are healed amen
[42:21] soul body and spirit and as we have
[42:26] ministered many times before found that
[42:28] that the Alpha ministry was the
[42:31] redemption of our souls the Omega
[42:33] ministry is the redemption of our bodies
[42:35] by the grace of Almighty God amen
[42:39] so let's believe with all of our hearts
[42:41] with our brother for our brother in the
[42:44] going forth of the word let's relieve
[42:46] with all of our hearts with our brother
[42:48] and for him for his physical condition a
[42:51] man in your physical condition and my
[42:54] physical condition that with His stripes
[42:56] we are not wha not will be but we are as
[43:01] finished as the brothers today if I was
[43:03] I am so I am healed he said by the grace
[43:07] of God and we're believing
[43:10] to the change of our bodies and the
[43:12] prophecy if you can't believe for the
[43:14] healing of the body how can you believe
[43:16] for the change of the body so god help
[43:18] us is my prayer and we're going to turn
[43:21] the service directly to our brother
[43:22] because he's had a long day and a long
[43:25] night-in in getting back here to
[43:29] Newfoundland so I guess the only
[43:33] solution to that easy they'd had to move
[43:35] here so so the Lord bless him and pray
[43:40] God to bless the ministry of the going
[43:42] forth of the word we're gonna sing only
[43:44] believe let's stand saying only believe
[43:46] all things are possible as our brother
[43:50] Brandon comes to minister the word amen
[43:53] so god bless you just keep keep your
[43:56] mind on the Lord keep your the year of
[43:59] the soul old major not your ears forget
[44:02] them
[44:03] keep the year of the soul open to the
[44:06] word then in that I've been here we're
[44:09] more concerned about our ears and where
[44:11] are their are the year of the soul than
[44:13] in that Anthony are here with the Spirit
[44:15] is saying to the church if you let
[44:18] anybody hear what the Spirit is saying
[44:19] to the bright by the grace of God is to
[44:22] give us rapture in faith the reality of
[44:25] the rapture Amen so that in a moment in
[44:29] the twinkling of an eye we are changed a
[44:31] man and cut away let's say can only
[44:34] believe as our brother comes to minister
[44:37] the word praise them and I said we
[44:39] welcome him god bless you amen
[44:42] hallelujah

[46:33] [Music]
[46:36] tonight you know really we could all
[46:39] come here and just have a nice time of
[46:41] fellowship but all things are possible
[46:43] not because we're here and we have
[46:45] abilities and we've got ambition or any
[46:47] of those things but the only reason all
[46:49] things are possible as he's here tonight
[46:51] and he's here not because I brought him
[46:53] with me although I believe I did bring
[46:55] with me but because you all brought him
[46:58] with you as well so we're thankful for
[47:00] that and thankful to be here tonight
[47:02] back with you under the bright lights
[47:06] back home back home we have a little
[47:09] dimmer in the sanctuary but I appreciate
[47:11] that like turn the spotlights on ya make
[47:14] you feel welcome make don't make you
[47:16] feel exposed or anything and yeah you
[47:20] know certainly thankful for the
[47:21] invitation to be here and I've really
[47:23] enjoyed our fellowship and getting to
[47:24] know most of you pretty well by now so
[47:27] god bless you and but the poll one got
[47:29] married last time since the last time I
[47:32] was here so if I see this is your wife
[47:33] in the front here that's good god bless
[47:36] you sister Kimberly is it alright pretty
[47:38] nice to meet you and just get to see the
[47:41] Saints again they say sometimes that if
[47:44] you want to get yourself comfortable you
[47:46] should you know say something humorous I
[47:48] thought maybe I talk to you about cancer
[47:49] for a few minutes you know just kind of
[47:53] really settle in with something like man
[47:56] so you know of course you know and I
[47:58] appreciate the prayers you know last
[48:00] last Remembrance Day weekend was the
[48:03] last time that I went a weekend without
[48:06] knowing kind of what was going on with
[48:08] the COFF that I had for about a year and
[48:09] and really hadn't been hurting me or
[48:12] really causing that much trouble but
[48:13] friends are staying with us and they
[48:15] said you know it doesn't really sound
[48:16] good but it does sound like it maybe
[48:18] could be asthma or something and and
[48:20] brother's wife had had had a very
[48:23] similar situation like that and so I
[48:24] went to the doctor thinking maybe with
[48:26] asthma inhaler would it would all
[48:29] improve and and within a couple days
[48:31] found out instead that there was you
[48:34] know some mass in my chest and I went
[48:37] they in a couple weeks a week and a half
[48:39] I guess found out that it was it was
[48:41] cancer Hodgkin's lymphoma
[48:43] about a softball sized tumor in my chest
[48:47] and lump actually I should have put the
[48:50] picture on the on the PowerPoint but you
[48:54] know we're basically from my chest up
[48:55] into my neck it's a bunch of different
[48:57] tumors and stuff there but you know by
[49:01] God's grace I would think that I was
[49:03] most thankful for and that time is
[49:04] really that you know I've said and our
[49:06] thought many times that when faced with
[49:10] something that could be life-threatening
[49:12] you really don't know what your
[49:14] reactions gonna be and you really don't
[49:16] know until you're in that place you know
[49:18] brother Bob see you in that place and
[49:19] other ones I don't know your stories but
[49:21] but what I was most thankful for is that
[49:25] there was such a peace in that time and
[49:27] and and such a confidence in the Lord
[49:29] and I didn't I think we all you know we
[49:33] all examine our lives in those
[49:35] situations to see if there's something
[49:37] there but you know that we should be
[49:38] making right or something that that you
[49:41] know hindering ourselves but but I just
[49:43] felt such a peace that you know I was
[49:47] right where God wanted me to be and that
[49:48] if does you know we are sometimes put
[49:51] conditions on what would be successful
[49:54] to us and but really I believe being a
[49:57] Christian and really walking with the
[49:58] Lord means that we're accepting of all
[50:00] outcomes you know we're we're not just
[50:02] clapping our hands this evening because
[50:04] we think we're gonna make it to the
[50:06] morning we're clapping our hands this
[50:08] evening because if this is our last
[50:09] breath or where God wants us to be right
[50:12] and so you know I was very thankful for
[50:14] that and you know as much as you don't
[50:16] think about it I do think about it as a
[50:18] real blessing in many ways because you
[50:22] know sometimes we we hide our struggles
[50:24] or we hide the things that are going
[50:26] wrong with us and then we find that you
[50:29] know the people can't pray people can't
[50:30] break because I don't know there's
[50:31] anything wrong with you people can you
[50:33] know support you and and really the
[50:35] outpouring of love from the body of
[50:36] Christ has just been just been wonderful
[50:39] and beautiful and I think that Saints
[50:41] praying is what we're supposed to be
[50:43] doing so I hope that we're all praying
[50:45] for each other and not just you know
[50:48] when we hear about a certain particular
[50:49] per case particular case but which is
[50:53] really really thankful to see that and
[50:55] myself it's it's not that you think that
[50:59] today is your last day every day
[51:01] it does make you more aware that you're
[51:04] not indestructible and that really for
[51:06] any of us you know our time could end
[51:08] any moment and so instead of wasting as
[51:11] much time as we do it just makes us a
[51:12] little more aware let's do something
[51:14] with the time that we have so as you can
[51:16] see I've lost all my hair it's been a
[51:18] very traumatic and I say that but if you
[51:22] don't know me I've had no hair for quite
[51:25] a while so my eyebrows have thinned
[51:28] quite a bit so if I if I look at you and
[51:31] I seem to be paying extra attention to
[51:33] your eyebrows it's just a little eyebrow
[51:35] Envy but look at your beard sisters and
[51:38] I and I am be them it's just you know
[51:42] it's just because mine's not growing
[51:43] very well right now but but by God's
[51:48] grace he's been so good to us and I got
[51:50] into the shower brother Adams and the
[51:53] shampoo or the body wash whatever said
[51:55] head and shoulders and I thought that's
[51:57] that's really good doesn't say hair and
[51:59] shoulders the parrot about it says head
[52:01] that it's a perfect time for me got
[52:06] everything ready for me brother I don't
[52:07] we shaved all right let's try to turn
[52:12] our attention now to the word thank you
[52:14] very much the musicians in our Bibles to
[52:17] Hebrews chapter 11 very familiar portion
[52:22] of Scripture to us
[52:30] it's Good Friday and you know telling
[52:34] our kids that we call it Good Friday and
[52:36] what happened on Good Friday they
[52:37] crucified our Lord and you know what
[52:40] could ever be good about that you know
[52:41] and and it's it you know it takes a
[52:44] little bit of Revelation to understand
[52:45] why that was a good thing you know and
[52:47] but it was good because it opened up a
[52:49] way for us that never could have been
[52:50] opened in any other way and so it's not
[52:52] just a Good Friday but possibly the best
[52:54] Friday you know that that ever could
[52:57] have happened with was when the devil
[52:59] was foolish enough to put our Lord on
[53:01] the cross and to take his natural life
[53:03] so that we could partake of his of a
[53:05] spiritual life so we want to celebrate
[53:08] that as we should every day by making
[53:11] the most of the time that we have to
[53:13] come and hear the word and to and say
[53:15] Lord whatever you have for me it's
[53:17] certainly not that the bold guy up front
[53:20] there that's gonna give it to me that's
[53:21] gonna come from Almighty God so we just
[53:23] trust in him tonight Hebrews chapter 11
[53:26] verse 1 says now faith is the ABS or
[53:28] substance all right faith is the
[53:29] substance of things hoped for the
[53:31] evidence of things not seen for by it
[53:34] the elders obtained a good report
[53:36] through faith we understand that the
[53:40] worlds which were frank worlds were
[53:42] framed by the Word of God so that the
[53:44] things which are seen were not made of
[53:47] things which do appear and then verse 6
[53:49] says but without faith it is impossible
[53:52] to please him for he that cometh to God
[53:55] must believe that he is and that he is a
[53:58] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[54:00] Him bow our heads Lord Jesus this
[54:04] evening we just are so thankful for all
[54:07] that you've done for us in our lives
[54:09] Lord and we immediately think lord of
[54:13] the blessings and the great privileges
[54:15] that we have as sons and daughters of
[54:17] God but Lord we're also so thankful that
[54:20] in your mind you had a plan for our
[54:22] lives and Lord that you're not that you
[54:26] love us enough that you're you're not
[54:28] worried about what we might feel in the
[54:30] moment or what would bring us joy all
[54:32] the time Lord but you're concerned about
[54:35] what will bring forth character from our
[54:37] lives Lord you're concerned about what
[54:39] will mold us into your image that will
[54:40] give us the same
[54:41] character and behavior that you have
[54:43] Lord and that's the highest calling and
[54:46] privilege we could ask that Lord give us
[54:48] the trials that we need lord give us the
[54:50] strength to get through those trials
[54:52] that Lord on the other side we'd have
[54:55] the character we'd have the nature we'd
[54:57] have the all the attributes that you put
[54:59] in us Lord shining forth like pure gold
[55:02] and Lord we just ask that you would come
[55:03] tonight Lord that you would focus our
[55:05] attention and that you would anoint us
[55:08] father both to give and to receive your
[55:10] word and to to do it with joy and with
[55:12] expectations and I Lord as we commit all
[55:15] things I commit myself to you in each of
[55:17] the saints here in Jesus name Amen amen
[55:20] you may be seated
[55:24] you're likely you've heard this
[55:27] scripture many many times from a
[55:31] thousand different angles you know faith
[55:34] is such a key part of the foundation of
[55:36] God's Word and we see even by the words
[55:39] that are written here in in Hebrews 11
[55:41] that it's not just conceptual it's not
[55:43] just an idea just not a theory
[55:46] but it's completely linked to our
[55:48] relationship of God you know faith is
[55:51] how we obtain a good report and faith is
[55:55] how we please God so it's very critical
[55:56] that we take heed and respond in
[55:58] particular to what this scripture is
[56:01] telling us you know but the service
[56:03] isn't you know specifically about faith
[56:05] but the part of verse six that says in
[56:08] order for us to even come to God we must
[56:10] believe that he is that he exists and
[56:13] he's a reward ER of them that diligently
[56:16] seek Him and so by God's grace tonight
[56:19] we're gonna look at this little thought
[56:21] of the true reward of course we believe
[56:25] we must believe that he is you know it'd
[56:29] be kind of foolish for all of us to keep
[56:31] coming to church and singing about a god
[56:34] that we don't believe in and praising a
[56:36] God that we don't believe in a giving
[56:38] credit to a God that we don't believe in
[56:39] for the lives that we haven't and so of
[56:41] course we must believe that he is you
[56:43] know but not just that he exists but
[56:46] that he cares
[56:47] that he has a character that's one that
[56:50] we can trust and appreciate and love
[56:53] that he's approachable that he has a
[56:56] provided way and that he will engage us
[56:59] in a relationship if we come his
[57:01] provided way you know and in order to
[57:03] have any hope of finding grace in his
[57:05] sight we must also believe that he is a
[57:07] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[57:10] Him you know wouldn't it be a little
[57:12] demotivating to say the least if if we
[57:14] could labor and toil and struggle to
[57:16] serve God our whole lives and still
[57:19] think that at the end he would reject us
[57:20] and send us to hell how many people be
[57:23] like wow sign me up for the life of toil
[57:25] and uncertainty that you know at the end
[57:27] of the road I might not make it yeah
[57:30] that doesn't sound very motivating it
[57:31] doesn't sound it doesn't sound like you
[57:33] know you'd have much chance of doing it
[57:35] that way and we see some people that
[57:37] live their Christian lives that way you
[57:39] know they labor and struggle and toil
[57:41] and press and try and try and try and
[57:43] try and yet still worried at the end
[57:46] they caught a reject them still worrying
[57:48] at the end that it wouldn't be good
[57:50] enough that it wouldn't be enough and
[57:52] that you know somehow God and all of
[57:53] that would find some reason to send them
[57:55] to hell instead of welcomed into him
[57:57] them into his kingdom there's no faith
[58:00] there that's why it says it takes faith
[58:03] to please God you know what
[58:06] use the example of the parable Jesus
[58:09] gave with the talents you know the one
[58:10] that received the one talent he was
[58:12] afraid his his master had given him one
[58:16] talent because he knew he could bring an
[58:18] increase on one talents but he was so
[58:21] afraid and when he comes to the matter
[58:23] of the master comes to him at the you
[58:25] know when he comes back and is measuring
[58:27] the increase and he says you know I was
[58:29] afraid because I knew you're a hard man
[58:30] hard to please and hard to you know you
[58:33] know you you reap where you haven't sown
[58:35] and and gather we haven't straw
[58:37] you know and so I was afraid and I went
[58:39] hid what you gave me What did he say
[58:42] that he didn't say oh no you're wrong
[58:45] I'm I'm actually really easy to please
[58:47] and I'm actually really you know I'm
[58:48] actually really easy to make happy and
[58:50] you know you're not not tonsured know he
[58:52] didn't tell him that but his role as a
[58:55] servant was to have confidence to use
[59:00] what God had given
[59:01] and what the master had given him and
[59:03] bring an increase on it and so the
[59:05] master was happy to reward those who did
[59:08] something with what he gave them and so
[59:10] you know looking at that we have to
[59:12] believe we have to have faith look at
[59:14] this man he he had one Talent and you
[59:16] think one town what's one town but if
[59:18] you look at what one town of gold was
[59:20] like 25 pounds of gold
[59:21] was itwas what a talent was that was
[59:24] like millions of dollars in art in our
[59:26] time is what was actually put in his
[59:28] hand so he was given a fair chunk of
[59:30] money you know he wasn't given ten bucks
[59:32] and said let go do something with this
[59:33] here don't spend it all on play no he
[59:35] was he was given a significant amount of
[59:38] wealth and said go do something with
[59:39] this but he had no faith and so it
[59:44] paralyzed him to do nothing without
[59:45] faith it's impossible to please God he
[59:48] had to have faith because the master
[59:50] said I'm giving this to you and I
[59:51] believe you can do something with it
[59:53] and so in order for us to please God
[59:55] today and for us to you know do that we
[59:57] have to have faith that God's given us
[1:00:00] what he's given us he's given us his
[1:00:02] word he's given us attributes he's given
[1:00:03] us a potential that if we go and labor
[1:00:06] with it it's gonna produce an increase
[1:00:08] and it's going to it's going to please
[1:00:10] the father it's going to give us a
[1:00:12] reward one day and so we can't come in
[1:00:15] you know walking through those pearly
[1:00:17] gates are wondering if we're gonna make
[1:00:19] the rap drive sold out I've given my
[1:00:21] whole life but I don't know if it's
[1:00:23] gonna be enough that's not faith that's
[1:00:26] that's hope that's you know I play in
[1:00:29] the percentages I think that's gonna
[1:00:31] work now we have to come to a place of
[1:00:32] faith where we know we're on this path
[1:00:35] we're doing God put these attributes in
[1:00:38] me for a purpose because he knew it
[1:00:40] would be enough and if i toil and i
[1:00:43] labor and I do what I'm supposed to do
[1:00:45] with what he's given me he has no choice
[1:00:48] but to let me in because he's a rewarder
[1:00:50] of those that diligently seek him the
[1:00:55] meaning of the word gospel is good news
[1:00:58] we forget that sometimes you know people
[1:01:01] think that like I'm coming to church oh
[1:01:02] boy what I'm gonna hear today how about
[1:01:04] if I get beat up today no the gospel
[1:01:07] they were supposed to be sharing is good
[1:01:08] news there's good news in and even
[1:01:11] sometimes in the worst beating we could
[1:01:13] get in church there's
[1:01:14] newse when your wounds heal and
[1:01:17] eventually you can see through those
[1:01:18] swollen eyes again then you know the
[1:01:22] Lord it's gotten more for you he you
[1:01:24] know he's he's rebuking and chastening
[1:01:27] because He loves us and that he wants us
[1:01:29] to fit the image that he has for us he
[1:01:31] wants us to be worthy of the place that
[1:01:33] he has envisioned for us it's good news
[1:01:36] to us the Word of God is full of good
[1:01:38] news and in particular three things that
[1:01:40] are more than just good God has made a
[1:01:44] lot of promises that's the first thing
[1:01:47] there's a lot of rewards in this in this
[1:01:49] gospel that God's given us then number
[1:01:52] two he keeps his promises you know it'd
[1:01:54] be great wonderful God makes lots of
[1:01:55] promises but I didn't keep any of them
[1:01:56] that would be you know awfully pointless
[1:01:59] you know he could make all the promises
[1:02:00] he wanted if he doesn't keep one that
[1:02:02] doesn't do us any good but he keeps the
[1:02:04] promises that he makes to us is even
[1:02:07] more important that he makes a lot of
[1:02:08] promises and then thirdly his promises
[1:02:11] are for you you know it's wonderful that
[1:02:14] God's made lots of promises it's
[1:02:16] wonderful that he keeps all those
[1:02:17] promises but it's got to be important to
[1:02:20] you he made them for you you know you
[1:02:24] didn't just make the promises for Adam
[1:02:27] or you know I'm Old Testament
[1:02:29] Adam alright you know or for Jacob or
[1:02:34] for Abraham or for you know different
[1:02:36] ones through the scripture he didn't
[1:02:37] just make them for Jesus or for the
[1:02:39] disciples or you know but he made them
[1:02:41] for you and and so all of the promises
[1:02:44] that God made not all of the promises
[1:02:46] that God made her for you which is good
[1:02:48] because you know some of those promises
[1:02:49] you probably wouldn't want to live
[1:02:51] throws through but the promises that God
[1:02:53] made for healing for salvation for the
[1:02:56] Holy Ghost for all of those things he
[1:02:58] made them for you and the scripture
[1:03:02] tells us that that God is immutable
[1:03:04] which means he can't change he can't he
[1:03:07] can't decide that you know what I made
[1:03:09] these promises for you but now I don't
[1:03:11] want to follow through on them he's
[1:03:12] bound by that word you know and I
[1:03:15] believe that God is not the kind of God
[1:03:17] that just like we are many times where
[1:03:19] we don't really think it through you
[1:03:21] know someone asks yeah we come help me
[1:03:23] do this you know yeah for sure
[1:03:24] these are to think like oh man busy that
[1:03:26] day do I
[1:03:27] want to help this person you know all of
[1:03:30] these things start coming to mind
[1:03:31] because we don't really process a lot of
[1:03:34] times and then we feel bad for making
[1:03:35] the commitments that we make and yet God
[1:03:38] doesn't do that God's not kicking
[1:03:39] himself today cuz he offered you
[1:03:41] salvation he's not say oh man I should
[1:03:44] have thought that through I find good if
[1:03:46] I gave that guy salvation they fell all
[1:03:47] these times I'm gonna really regret it
[1:03:49] no God knew every time you were gonna
[1:03:51] fall
[1:03:52] God knew every time you were gonna
[1:03:53] stumble God knew every time that you'd
[1:03:55] be crying out to him saying I'm not
[1:03:57] worthy I'm not worthy and yet he still
[1:03:59] chose you and he still made the promise
[1:04:01] to you and he's not trying to take it
[1:04:03] back today he's not trying to find a
[1:04:05] loophole to get out of it he still loves
[1:04:07] you just the same today no matter what
[1:04:08] condition you're in
[1:04:09] and he's gonna carry you through all the
[1:04:11] way to the finish God's rewards program
[1:04:15] is not cheap like the way the world does
[1:04:18] it you know it's not like collecting
[1:04:20] points on every purchase you know I'm
[1:04:23] getting so sick of the word rewards
[1:04:24] program because it just feels so empty
[1:04:26] most of the time when it's used that you
[1:04:28] know you go to the grocery store have
[1:04:30] you heard of our rewards program you go
[1:04:31] to the department so you know gasps you
[1:04:33] know are you part of this your
[1:04:35] membership are you you know part of this
[1:04:36] and and you know it's just over and over
[1:04:39] and over again it feels like you can be
[1:04:41] collecting points on anything you ever
[1:04:42] purchased but you're never gonna get
[1:04:45] anything for it you know what you get
[1:04:47] compared to what you spend it's just
[1:04:48] such a you know small value you know and
[1:04:51] I'm so glad that God's rewards program
[1:04:54] doesn't work like that God rewards Paul
[1:04:56] tells us are abundant above all we ask
[1:04:59] or think you know Jesus told us that you
[1:05:02] have not because you ask not not because
[1:05:05] your rewards aren't good enough you're
[1:05:07] not because you haven't labored long
[1:05:09] enough you're not because you haven't
[1:05:11] come to church you know faithfully
[1:05:12] enough but because I've given it freely
[1:05:16] you know when when my wife and I were
[1:05:18] first married we and we just passed 15
[1:05:20] years this last December and thank God
[1:05:22] for her grace as well as His grace but
[1:05:25] you know we she already had an air miles
[1:05:27] like account started and I thought oh
[1:05:29] man she's already got a air miles
[1:05:31] account started like like mom she's
[1:05:33] really doing well in and so we had that
[1:05:35] here miles account for
[1:05:36] you know our first 10 years of marriage
[1:05:38] and and we're coming up to our
[1:05:40] anniversary thought oh you know we'd
[1:05:42] like to do something special so we
[1:05:43] booked a little trip to Florida and went
[1:05:45] on a cruise and I thought oh man these
[1:05:47] air miles we were collecting these for
[1:05:48] 10 years like that we must have just
[1:05:50] been stockpiling these things like crazy
[1:05:52] you know I never looked at it before I
[1:05:54] never even you know I never knew what
[1:05:56] the numbers meant or anything at all
[1:05:58] this must be amazing so you know you
[1:06:00] know cuz we use our credit card and we
[1:06:02] even you know people would you know the
[1:06:05] church sometimes that we'd purchase
[1:06:06] things for the church and get reimbursed
[1:06:07] like oh man people talk about these
[1:06:09] rewards it must be amazing and so say
[1:06:11] the oh let's check it out so after 10
[1:06:13] years of collecting ear mouth we had
[1:06:15] enough for one ticket so my wife had a
[1:06:19] really lovely time so we both went on
[1:06:25] the ship but it turned out after all the
[1:06:29] conditions and fees and everything else
[1:06:31] all we were really saved was about a
[1:06:33] third of one ticket for one person you
[1:06:38] know just that you know we've spent 10
[1:06:40] years collecting these you know you know
[1:06:42] maybe that tells you a little we make or
[1:06:44] spend in that time but but also just
[1:06:47] thinking like what are we doing with 10
[1:06:49] years of our lives if that's all that
[1:06:51] we're producing you know and you know
[1:06:53] and I thought I'm so glad that God's
[1:06:56] rewards don't work like that I was so
[1:06:59] glad you don't have to serve the Lord
[1:07:00] for 10 years before you can redeem your
[1:07:02] points for a little bit of blessing you
[1:07:04] know I'm so glad that you know you can't
[1:07:06] you don't have to worry about redeeming
[1:07:08] your points for a little bit of healing
[1:07:09] you know it and say oh man you know here
[1:07:11] comes a disease in your life here comes
[1:07:13] a situation in your life you know you've
[1:07:14] got pneumonia let's say yeah you know
[1:07:16] well you know thankfully you know 50
[1:07:18] percent of that is covered by you know
[1:07:20] by God because you've been serving him
[1:07:22] you know here's your points that you
[1:07:23] accumulated wouldn't that be horrible
[1:07:25] horrible way to serve the Lord but God's
[1:07:28] rewards are plentiful and abundant and
[1:07:32] you know you don't have to be a
[1:07:33] Christian actually I was kind of I was
[1:07:36] gonna say that you don't have to be a
[1:07:37] Christian for 30 years in order to
[1:07:38] access them but God's rewards are so
[1:07:40] good that you don't even have to be a
[1:07:41] Christian and many times to access them
[1:07:44] that's how abundant it is you know if
[1:07:46] someone will come asking him someone
[1:07:48] will come humbling the
[1:07:49] selves gods rewards are so abundant he
[1:07:52] healed people that turned around and
[1:07:54] walked back into sin no heal people that
[1:07:56] you know that from that day where were
[1:07:59] the same person they always were but
[1:08:01] they came asking in faith and he gave it
[1:08:03] to them
[1:08:03] how much more for his children who love
[1:08:06] him and walk in his ways you know God's
[1:08:13] God doesn't hide away in fine print even
[1:08:16] though our Bibles printing some pretty
[1:08:18] small sometimes but you know his he
[1:08:21] doesn't hide away in the fine print we
[1:08:23] would say or the exclusions you know
[1:08:25] some some restrictions apply they say in
[1:08:27] every you know ad for every good thing
[1:08:29] but you know God doesn't hide away in
[1:08:32] those things he has very clear terms and
[1:08:35] conditions and that's one of the things
[1:08:37] that I appreciate most God doesn't tell
[1:08:39] you that a Christian life is going to be
[1:08:41] an easy life and God doesn't tell you
[1:08:42] that a Christian life is going to be a
[1:08:43] simple life but he tells us that he'll
[1:08:45] be with us through every step of that
[1:08:47] and so Peter came to him one day to
[1:08:49] Jesus and said then Peter said lo we
[1:08:52] have left all and followed thee and he
[1:08:55] sent it to them verily I say unto you
[1:08:56] there is no man that a left house or
[1:08:59] parents or brethren or wife or children
[1:09:01] for the kingdom of God's sake who shall
[1:09:04] not receive manifold more in this
[1:09:06] present time and in the world to come
[1:09:09] life everlasting you know a Peter came
[1:09:12] and maybe he was feeling sorry for
[1:09:14] himself that day or maybe Jesus had been
[1:09:16] talking about people that weren't
[1:09:17] willing to give enough you know people
[1:09:19] weren't willing to go the you know the
[1:09:20] full the full way and Peter wanted to
[1:09:23] tell the Lord Lord Lord we've given away
[1:09:24] you know everything we've given it all
[1:09:27] thinking that you know we've suffered
[1:09:29] well haha we've sacrificed a lot and
[1:09:31] Jesus turns around and said there's no
[1:09:34] man that gives without receiving a
[1:09:36] reward for that gift you know so
[1:09:38] whatever you know whatever you've given
[1:09:41] Peter don't worry there's manifold more
[1:09:43] in this present time and in the world to
[1:09:45] come life everlasting of God is a great
[1:09:47] mathematician but his particular
[1:09:50] specialties are adding and multiplying
[1:09:53] you know the devil is also a great
[1:09:56] mathematician by his specialties are
[1:09:57] dividing and subtracting you know and
[1:09:59] that's so that's what a descriptor says
[1:10:01] mark those that
[1:10:03] cause division among you yeah they're
[1:10:05] making it smaller right and you know so
[1:10:07] you want to we don't want to be dividing
[1:10:09] we don't want to be subtracting we want
[1:10:11] to be adding and multiply you know and
[1:10:14] God doesn't give you something for
[1:10:16] nothing you know God's Word never says
[1:10:18] you know just open your arms and I'll
[1:10:22] fill them with all sorts of blessings
[1:10:23] but God says whatever you give he will
[1:10:28] add and multiply that to give you a
[1:10:30] great great reward you know so so many
[1:10:33] times we're very carnal and we think
[1:10:35] that we hear that and we immediately
[1:10:37] think cash and prizes you know just like
[1:10:39] you know I keep the Jesus and everything
[1:10:41] was just wonderful and so you know
[1:10:43] amazing and everything just you know the
[1:10:45] milk and honey just flowed but it's it's
[1:10:50] so different from that and and so much
[1:10:52] better than that because he says he'll
[1:10:55] give us manifold more many times more as
[1:10:58] that manifold means and then what you
[1:11:00] started with both in this life and in
[1:11:03] the world to come you get everlasting
[1:11:06] life and if we really ever grasp the
[1:11:08] depth of the rewards we'd be content to
[1:11:11] never have another natural blessing just
[1:11:13] to know we have an eternal reward you
[1:11:15] know that that really is the is the you
[1:11:18] know the cake the icing on the cake Saul
[1:11:20] though you know the natural things we
[1:11:21] could possibly have that are temporary
[1:11:23] but the real cake the real meat of it
[1:11:25] all is that there's everlasting life you
[1:11:28] know a life without and you know you
[1:11:30] think this body is great when you look
[1:11:32] in the mirror maybe they go mad gods
[1:11:33] really give me a blessing here but you
[1:11:35] know but what what the real blessing is
[1:11:38] is that this bodies the cheap one this
[1:11:40] body is the lousy one then the body that
[1:11:42] come is the one that never gets sick
[1:11:44] that never gets old that never gets
[1:11:46] tired that's the one that we're striving
[1:11:48] for it so really all the blessings that
[1:11:50] you are craving on this side are nothing
[1:11:52] compared to what awaits us on the other
[1:11:54] side that's why Paul says you know the
[1:11:56] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:11:58] even worthy to be compared with the
[1:12:00] glory that should be revealed at us what
[1:12:02] a what a precious thing that is because
[1:12:04] if we ever really grasp that how could
[1:12:06] we worry about this oh I'm getting old
[1:12:09] oh I'm getting weak ah I'm getting so
[1:12:11] tired and discouraged well guess what
[1:12:13] this is the lousy part of it all
[1:12:14] the greatest part still awaits us you
[1:12:19] know that alone without anything else is
[1:12:21] is a greater thing than any offer the
[1:12:24] devil could ever make you you know Jesus
[1:12:26] said what would it be to gain the world
[1:12:28] and lose your soul that's you know the
[1:12:30] devil can offer you the world but you'll
[1:12:33] lose your soul
[1:12:34] but Jesus can offer you a life that
[1:12:36] never has you nobody it doesn't even end
[1:12:41] there you know after all of these things
[1:12:43] after all of these you know things that
[1:12:46] God's given us naturally and everlasting
[1:12:48] life on top of that there's still an
[1:12:50] abundance of blessings prosperity joy
[1:12:52] peace healing deliverance so much more
[1:12:55] on and on and on available to everyone
[1:12:59] that walks according to God's provided
[1:13:02] path mark tells the story here of Peter
[1:13:05] coming to Jesus again and should read it
[1:13:07] because there's one little difference as
[1:13:09] well maybe Luke was a little more of an
[1:13:11] optimist or maybe Mark was paying
[1:13:13] attention a little bit more but when
[1:13:16] when Mark tells the story he says then
[1:13:19] Peter began to say unto Him lo we have
[1:13:21] left all and followed thee and jesus
[1:13:24] answered and said verily I say unto you
[1:13:25] there is no man that hath left house or
[1:13:27] brethren her sisters or father or mother
[1:13:29] or wife or children or lands for my sake
[1:13:32] in the Gospels but he shall receive a
[1:13:36] hundredfold now in this time houses and
[1:13:39] brethren and sisters and mothers and
[1:13:42] children and lands with with
[1:13:44] persecutions and in the world to come
[1:13:48] eternal life but many that are first
[1:13:50] shall be last and the last first you
[1:13:54] know when mark tells the same account he
[1:13:56] also includes the one thing we forget
[1:13:58] among the terms and conditions he'll
[1:14:01] bless abundantly even a hundred times
[1:14:03] what we've given but among all the
[1:14:05] blessings there's some persecution
[1:14:07] there's some trials there's some hard
[1:14:10] times there's some there's some
[1:14:12] difficulty that comes in and the main
[1:14:14] reason that comes is that the devil and
[1:14:16] the world will not just let you receive
[1:14:18] these rewards without conflict you know
[1:14:21] the devil doesn't see you just you know
[1:14:22] reaping the rewards of God's rewards
[1:14:24] program and say oh yeah that's wonderful
[1:14:26] let's celebrate that
[1:14:27] No you know yeah oh it does this put a
[1:14:29] big bullseye on your back you know and
[1:14:31] if you ever want to see people get you
[1:14:33] know you know Church even get hostile
[1:14:35] it's you know let someone really get
[1:14:37] somewhere and you know really whether
[1:14:40] that's naturally spiritually whatever
[1:14:41] let someone be you know really blessed
[1:14:43] and that creates more conflict than if
[1:14:46] someone was going through trial you know
[1:14:48] if you're going through a tough time
[1:14:49] everybody be praying for you can
[1:14:51] everybody be supporting everybody tell
[1:14:52] we love you you know it's god bless you
[1:14:54] don't worry God will bring you through
[1:14:55] this you know and someone gets blessed
[1:14:57] and you know ends like oh that's a nice
[1:14:59] car you got there but they're like wow
[1:15:01] yeah wow you know oh yeah well that was
[1:15:05] nice that especially saying there yeah
[1:15:07] you know I you a little off there you
[1:15:09] know just whatever any time someone gets
[1:15:11] blessed and raised up a little bit we
[1:15:13] actually have a harder time with that
[1:15:14] that fallen nature starts to rise up a
[1:15:17] little bit because the devil is jealous
[1:15:18] the devil doesn't want to see you
[1:15:20] prosper with God he wants to tear you
[1:15:22] back there
[1:15:23] you know the people your neighbors are
[1:15:25] not happy that God's blessing you
[1:15:27] because that brings judgment on them for
[1:15:29] the choices they made and what's what's
[1:15:31] happening in their lives and so there's
[1:15:33] a there's an impulse there and of course
[1:15:34] we know the devil sure doesn't want to
[1:15:36] raise up a Christian life as the one
[1:15:38] that's the best life so he does
[1:15:39] everything that he can to try to tear it
[1:15:41] back down so there's conflict that comes
[1:15:43] there but I love that God doesn't hide
[1:15:45] that away you know we can see right from
[1:15:47] the Garden of Eden that you know when
[1:15:49] God rewards somebody immediately there's
[1:15:53] some hostility you know God rewards you
[1:15:56] know able and immediately Cain rises up
[1:16:01] and slays you know that that tells you
[1:16:03] how much likelihood the the Devils gonna
[1:16:05] give you a pat on the back when God does
[1:16:06] something good in your life why because
[1:16:08] there's something immediately that tries
[1:16:10] to kill that off when God gives you a
[1:16:12] reward so so be aware you know we wanted
[1:16:14] God's blessing we've got God's reward
[1:16:16] it's not going to be without some
[1:16:18] obstacles there will be battles but
[1:16:21] there will be an abundance of rewards
[1:16:23] but let me remind you as I said before
[1:16:25] God is a multiplier it's a
[1:16:30] multiplication of what you've given
[1:16:33] it's sowing and reaping so because it's
[1:16:38] sowing and reaping a lot of it falls
[1:16:42] not only what are you sewing but how
[1:16:45] much are you saying so if you haven't
[1:16:48] been reaping an abundance of God's
[1:16:50] rewards you haven't been sowing and
[1:16:53] abundance
[1:16:54] you know don't blame anyone else for
[1:16:57] that they'll blend a pastor don't blame
[1:16:59] a church don't blame your family don't
[1:17:01] be response
[1:17:01] come play with children don't play
[1:17:03] parents it's up to you whatever you sow
[1:17:06] you will reap God is a multiplier you
[1:17:10] know this is all on you you know and and
[1:17:11] so sometimes we ask I go oh man you know
[1:17:14] what
[1:17:14] what's church gonna do for me today
[1:17:16] what's God gonna do for me today what's
[1:17:17] the body of Christ gonna do for me today
[1:17:19] you know but it like like JFK said you
[1:17:21] know ask not what this country can do
[1:17:24] for you you know that's safe same thing
[1:17:25] like don't ask what's God gonna do for
[1:17:27] me today
[1:17:28] well what can I do for the body of
[1:17:30] Christ today if you want to know how
[1:17:32] church is gonna be maybe spend some time
[1:17:35] frame for you want to know how the
[1:17:37] ministers service is gonna be spend some
[1:17:39] time praying for spend some time asking
[1:17:41] God to use a minister to help you today
[1:17:43] you know spend some time praying for the
[1:17:45] saints you know not just like oh man
[1:17:47] we're so into today but praying for them
[1:17:49] because you know they're sick we're
[1:17:50] praying for them because you know
[1:17:51] they're going through a difficult time
[1:17:52] pray for them because you know they're
[1:17:53] struggling and see what happens ask what
[1:17:58] opportunities exist for you to do
[1:18:00] service for God and for others and by
[1:18:02] that God multiplies those things to
[1:18:05] bring rewards in your own life
[1:18:07] abundantly how abundantly
[1:18:10] well Malachi the prophet got the word
[1:18:13] from the Lord and he said bring me all
[1:18:15] the tithes into the storehouse that
[1:18:17] there may be meat in mine house and
[1:18:20] prove me now herewith saith the Lord of
[1:18:23] Hosts thus saith the Lord here if I will
[1:18:26] not open to you the windows of heaven
[1:18:27] and pour you out a blessing that there
[1:18:29] shall not be room enough to receive it I
[1:18:32] don't know about you our house gets a
[1:18:34] little cluttered sometime but there is
[1:18:35] still room for more blessings there's
[1:18:37] still more room for a few more good
[1:18:39] things in our lives right you know
[1:18:41] there's still room for why do we sing
[1:18:42] you know and it's tough I don't think
[1:18:44] it's about that but you know but you
[1:18:45] know so God God tells us thus saith the
[1:18:50] Lord
[1:18:51] prove me
[1:18:53] you know and sometimes we might think
[1:18:55] that's a little Cavalier or that's a
[1:18:56] little foolish but God tells us himself
[1:18:59] thus saith the Lord
[1:19:01] prove me you like to be challenged
[1:19:06] because God makes you a personal
[1:19:08] challenge right here in its word in fact
[1:19:10] it doesn't even say you have to be the
[1:19:12] bride to get it doesn't even say you
[1:19:14] have to be the elect doesn't is to say
[1:19:15] any of us think it just says prove me if
[1:19:19] you give me prove me that I won't give
[1:19:21] you an abundance that you can't even
[1:19:23] contain pay your tithes give your
[1:19:27] offering and God will multiply that to
[1:19:30] return to you a blessing that is so
[1:19:32] abundant there isn't room to contain it
[1:19:34] so if you want to obligate God give of
[1:19:37] yourself to his provided way to the way
[1:19:40] he's told us you know I'm not talking
[1:19:41] about the abuses you know brother
[1:19:43] Gerald's like Oh wonderful speech about
[1:19:45] ties tonight but that's you know that's
[1:19:48] not it
[1:19:48] God made this promise the NES gods
[1:19:51] rewards program you know and so I'm not
[1:19:54] talking about the abuses that churches
[1:19:56] have made pull in on the people you know
[1:19:58] give your life savings so the pastor can
[1:20:00] evangelize the world on a private jet
[1:20:02] you know give your life savings and
[1:20:03] we'll splash the name of this church all
[1:20:05] over the world you know give your life
[1:20:06] savings and you know I'll be on the
[1:20:07] front cover of every magazine in the
[1:20:09] country you know not that kind of
[1:20:11] nonsense I'm talking about a personal
[1:20:15] challenge from God and a promise that he
[1:20:18] will multiply what you've given you know
[1:20:21] I've gone to a couple of financial
[1:20:22] training courses and one of the
[1:20:24] principles that I've heard that I really
[1:20:25] like that is that big increases on
[1:20:28] little amounts are still small gains you
[1:20:32] know financial people always talk about
[1:20:33] percentages right you know yeah I put
[1:20:35] this money in the stock market a game
[1:20:37] twenty five percent one year it's like
[1:20:38] you know oh wow that's really good you
[1:20:40] know the banks on the offering like half
[1:20:42] of one percent or you know whatever
[1:20:43] sounds really good you know but but
[1:20:45] think about a five hundred percent
[1:20:47] return oh man that's a lot of money
[1:20:49] that's five times on ten dollars oh man
[1:20:54] you're gonna retire now aren't you you
[1:20:55] got Oh fifty dollars you know yeah five
[1:20:57] hundred percent return on ten dollars
[1:21:00] it's only fifty dollars you know it's
[1:21:01] not it sounds fantastic their returns
[1:21:04] are out of this world
[1:21:05] but the actual reward is pretty small
[1:21:08] and so you know God's rewards are the
[1:21:10] same you know just give the bare minimum
[1:21:14] that's so some people think I'll just
[1:21:15] give the bare minimum you know I'll just
[1:21:18] come to church when I really feel like
[1:21:19] it I'll just pray when I really have to
[1:21:22] I'll just read my Bible the bare minimum
[1:21:23] and there's a reason their life doesn't
[1:21:25] lack that their life doesn't have an
[1:21:27] abundance of strengthen and power and
[1:21:31] any of those things it's because God's
[1:21:32] trying to multiply even a hundredfold of
[1:21:35] nothing is still nothing I want a
[1:21:38] million times what I put in sure but
[1:21:41] you're putting in nothing so a million
[1:21:42] times zero is still zero you're not even
[1:21:44] the youngest child here probably learned
[1:21:46] that already it and so you know that's
[1:21:48] what you'd say oh man you know God's
[1:21:50] been blessing me you know surely he has
[1:21:52] you know but if you don't have anything
[1:21:54] it's because that's what you were given
[1:21:55] you know you you weren't putting it
[1:21:57] enough in for that multiplication to
[1:21:59] make a difference but what happens if we
[1:22:02] put in all we can't afford into the
[1:22:05] offering instead of just a small token
[1:22:07] and prove God not not proof you know
[1:22:12] anything else but prove God you know
[1:22:15] it's exactly what the word says in
[1:22:16] Malachi prove me you know you're 10% is
[1:22:19] God's money of course filling up the
[1:22:22] offering that's your money but what
[1:22:24] about our time our effort our prayers
[1:22:26] all of those things that we can do so
[1:22:29] much more in God's a multiplier of all
[1:22:31] of those things and so prove God and see
[1:22:34] if he doesn't take those things and open
[1:22:36] an abundance on you like you've never
[1:22:38] experienced before because he told us to
[1:22:40] do it the same way he said thou shall
[1:22:43] not he said prove me no the same way he
[1:22:46] said he's got you know mansion on the
[1:22:47] other side for you he's got a seat on
[1:22:49] his throne for you all of those things
[1:22:51] he said prove me if I won't pour you an
[1:22:53] abundance so that's the first part of
[1:22:58] this really you want to get more from
[1:23:01] God that's one of those things prove
[1:23:03] prove him by giving more of yourself not
[1:23:05] just your money your time your prayers
[1:23:08] all of those things but what God really
[1:23:11] cares about and this is where we get
[1:23:15] into the true reward for all the lowest
[1:23:17] things that God has promised to us
[1:23:18] he doesn't want us to be focused on
[1:23:21] those rewards God gives you all these
[1:23:25] rewards all of these things to motivate
[1:23:27] you and to excite you and to bless you
[1:23:29] and all of those things and for all of
[1:23:30] that God doesn't want you to be focused
[1:23:32] on those rewards the ultimate key to the
[1:23:36] way God operates and the major reason
[1:23:38] for every person who's ever failed in
[1:23:40] God's program is that none of these
[1:23:43] things even eternal life and a glorified
[1:23:46] body is the true reward God gives you
[1:23:51] the challenge to prove him but what he
[1:23:53] wants from you is your focus your
[1:23:57] attention your love and appreciation and
[1:24:00] everyone who has ever been chosen by
[1:24:03] goddess and failed has failed for that
[1:24:06] reason is that after a while they've
[1:24:09] lost their focus you know even from from
[1:24:12] Eve in the garden to Israel to the
[1:24:14] Pharisees to the early church to you
[1:24:16] today the main reason that people miss
[1:24:18] God is that they're not focused on him
[1:24:21] the brother branham tells a story as far
[1:24:24] as I could tell you only ever told it
[1:24:25] one time and he didn't tell it to a
[1:24:27] bunch of theologians he didn't tell it
[1:24:30] to the most spiritual people all around
[1:24:32] he told it to a bunch of kids that were
[1:24:34] graduating high school you know and just
[1:24:37] like Jesus parables I like brother
[1:24:39] Browns stories because there's more to
[1:24:40] it than just the story itself but you
[1:24:43] know he tells this story to a group of
[1:24:45] kids that's graduating in Tucson and in
[1:24:48] the message come follow me
[1:24:50] 1963 said little story one time I heard
[1:24:53] of a man who was all he was poor he
[1:24:58] always wanted to it's you know it's a
[1:24:59] little stick a fairy story like it
[1:25:01] always stuck with me though one day he
[1:25:03] picked a flower and the flower was magic
[1:25:06] and the flower answered him I know this
[1:25:08] is sounding very spiritual so far to the
[1:25:10] most spiritual people and brother Browns
[1:25:12] telling a story of a magic flower but
[1:25:14] stick with that he said he picked a
[1:25:16] flower and it was magic and the flower
[1:25:18] answered him and said you've been poor
[1:25:20] all your life he said now ask what you
[1:25:23] will and it'll be given to you the man
[1:25:26] said that yonder's mountain would open
[1:25:29] up and I could go over there in and find
[1:25:31] the gold in the
[1:25:32] well he said you'll have to take me with
[1:25:34] you wherever you go see you'll have to
[1:25:36] take me with you
[1:25:37] so wherever I am then you can ask what
[1:25:40] you will he walked to the mountain in
[1:25:43] the mountain opened up and he went in
[1:25:45] the shelves was full of gold and
[1:25:47] diamonds as the little fairy story goes
[1:25:49] he laid the flower down on a table or
[1:25:52] rock and he Rani grabbed a great big gem
[1:25:54] and he said I must go show this to my
[1:25:56] friends now I'm a rich man
[1:25:58] I have everything now I must show this
[1:26:00] and so the flower spoke but said you
[1:26:04] forgot the main thing so he runs back
[1:26:07] and picks up her well maybe I'll get a
[1:26:10] piece of gold I'll get a piece of silver
[1:26:12] and so he said ah I'll hurry out to tell
[1:26:14] the people how rich I am and what all
[1:26:16] I've got and he got to the door and the
[1:26:19] flower said but you forgot the main
[1:26:22] thing so he runs back again and he's
[1:26:25] sitting here we find all kinds of
[1:26:27] material so he picked up a stone he said
[1:26:29] he said I'll go take this stone and show
[1:26:31] the people what kind of stone this
[1:26:32] mountain is made out of so I can find my
[1:26:34] way back to it you know see and he
[1:26:39] started out the door and the flower said
[1:26:40] for the final time you have forgot the
[1:26:43] main thing oh he said oh shut up see he
[1:26:48] didn't want to hear it anymore forgot
[1:26:50] the main thing and he ran out the door
[1:26:52] and when he did the door closed behind
[1:26:55] him with the flower on the inside the
[1:26:58] main thing was the flower see the main
[1:27:01] thing was the flower and so my question
[1:27:04] tonight is have we forgotten the main
[1:27:07] thing the true reward because this isn't
[1:27:12] a fairy story this is the greatest story
[1:27:14] ever told you know that it's not about a
[1:27:17] magic flower
[1:27:18] it's about Almighty God who created all
[1:27:21] things and who formed you from the dust
[1:27:24] of the earth and who said that if you'll
[1:27:26] take him with you everywhere that you go
[1:27:28] he'll give you all that you could ever
[1:27:30] desire he's the main thing and have we
[1:27:35] forgotten it you know just like that man
[1:27:38] when we get what we want from God many
[1:27:41] times we just push God aside and we
[1:27:44] enjoy those temporary
[1:27:45] things that we have forgetting the one
[1:27:47] that gave us all of those things you
[1:27:51] know and when we think about it if he
[1:27:53] really is the true reward then if he
[1:27:57] took everything else away from us every
[1:28:00] blessing every thing that we enjoy every
[1:28:03] and everything that we trust in
[1:28:04] everything that we take comfort with you
[1:28:07] know in can if he could take all of that
[1:28:09] away could you still praise God could
[1:28:12] you still think God could you still
[1:28:14] serve Him if all of those things were
[1:28:16] gone because the truth is if you can't
[1:28:19] do that you don't have the right focus
[1:28:23] if you can come to church and clap your
[1:28:26] hands because you just got a raise at
[1:28:28] work you have the wrong focus because if
[1:28:31] you think if you can't come to church
[1:28:32] and clap your hands when you lose your
[1:28:34] job you've cut the wrong focus because
[1:28:37] whether God gives you at all or it seems
[1:28:39] like he's given you nothing he's still
[1:28:41] worthy of our praise because he's the
[1:28:42] main thing you know this is the absolute
[1:28:46] essence of God's character why does he
[1:28:49] why does he require all to be given but
[1:28:51] because he gave us all you know he has
[1:28:54] set the example he's you know one of the
[1:28:56] things they tell you about bosses and
[1:28:57] leadership is that you ought to be
[1:28:59] willing to do everything that you ask
[1:29:00] somebody else to do you know don't ask
[1:29:02] your employees to do something if you
[1:29:04] are willing to do it yourself and here
[1:29:06] God is the ultimate example of that
[1:29:07] because he never asked you to do
[1:29:09] anything that he hasn't already done
[1:29:10] himself he doesn't ask you to sacrifice
[1:29:13] without having sacrificed he sacrificed
[1:29:15] all for us and so he says from you
[1:29:19] that's what it's gonna cost from you -
[1:29:21] it's gonna cost your total your total
[1:29:24] focus and that might cost everything
[1:29:27] that you have to give you know and so if
[1:29:30] we take those two things I believe we're
[1:29:33] so much closer to the Lord if we
[1:29:34] recognize that God is willing to pour
[1:29:37] out an abundance on us based on what we
[1:29:39] give and then we're also recognized that
[1:29:42] God's requirement is that focus will be
[1:29:46] so much closer to the Lord every one
[1:29:49] since Adam has struggled with that focus
[1:29:51] because our greedy fallen natures are
[1:29:54] especially susceptible
[1:29:56] you focusing on the gifts and not the
[1:30:00] giver to focusing on the rewards and not
[1:30:03] on the reward err you know and even the
[1:30:06] very elect of God have struggled with
[1:30:08] that it's not doesn't it doesn't make
[1:30:09] you you know outside of God's program if
[1:30:13] that's what you struggle with because
[1:30:14] even God's very elect even some of the
[1:30:16] ones that we put the highest trust in in
[1:30:18] Scripture struggled with this very thing
[1:30:20] and I'll show you that right now
[1:30:21] you know Genesis 15 records God speaking
[1:30:24] to Abraham and God God speaking to
[1:30:26] Abraham is the first time that we get a
[1:30:27] glimpse of him sharing the true reward
[1:30:30] with somebody and he says after these
[1:30:32] things the word of the Lord came unto
[1:30:33] Abram in a vision and said fear not
[1:30:35] Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding
[1:30:39] great reward I am I am thy shield and
[1:30:44] thy exceeding great reward and Abram the
[1:30:47] very father of our faith says Lord God
[1:30:50] what wilt thou give me seeing I go
[1:30:54] childless and the steward of my house is
[1:30:56] this Eliezer of Damascus Abraham is the
[1:30:58] very father of faith he's given us an
[1:31:01] example of what it takes to please God
[1:31:03] and it tells us the scripture tells us
[1:31:06] of course that abraham believed God and
[1:31:08] God counted that for righteousness but
[1:31:10] look at Abraham's response when God
[1:31:11] tells them what the true reward is God
[1:31:14] says I am the true reward and Abraham
[1:31:17] says what will you give me well I just
[1:31:21] told you that Abram I am the true reward
[1:31:24] it's like wonderful Lord but what
[1:31:26] rewards can I expect they you know Abram
[1:31:29] just doesn't get it because you know the
[1:31:31] package deal that when God says I am thy
[1:31:33] shield and the exceeding great reward is
[1:31:36] above all that Abram can ask or think
[1:31:39] you know it's a blows his mind to such a
[1:31:42] way that when God tells him I am your
[1:31:44] reward he immediately reduces it to
[1:31:46] something that he can understand and
[1:31:48] says okay but what do I get you know
[1:31:49] what do I get out of this and God says
[1:31:51] I'm your reward I'm gonna give you
[1:31:53] everything that you could ever imagine
[1:31:55] you know and yet Abraham immediately
[1:31:57] reduces that to something what's the
[1:31:59] reward what can I have how you know
[1:32:01] where how am I gonna get a son how am I
[1:32:02] gonna get an heir all these things he
[1:32:04] immediately reduces it to his own narrow
[1:32:06] mindset and yet God's trying to tell
[1:32:10] I'm everything that you ever need
[1:32:13] that's why Jesus said I am the way and
[1:32:16] the truth of life I am the bread that
[1:32:18] comes down from heaven I you know drink
[1:32:20] this water and you'll never thirst again
[1:32:21] what he's trying to you know any you
[1:32:24] read the interactions that Jesus had
[1:32:25] telling people things like this you know
[1:32:27] and and every time he tell them they
[1:32:29] totally misunderstand you know the woman
[1:32:31] at the well even you know this is the
[1:32:32] most confusing thing somebody's ever
[1:32:34] told her in her life when when Jesus
[1:32:35] says to me you know if you knew what
[1:32:37] kind of water I could offer you you'd
[1:32:39] never thirst again and then she says oh
[1:32:40] you know give me this water so enough to
[1:32:42] come back to as well you know like she
[1:32:43] totally misses the point you know or you
[1:32:46] know Jesus said unless he you know this
[1:32:48] flesh and and drink this blood there's
[1:32:49] no life in you
[1:32:50] I'm your reward essentially is what he's
[1:32:51] telling them and they say like oh that's
[1:32:53] so gross I don't want that I'm like you
[1:32:55] hear this sicko and they all left
[1:32:56] you know everybody turned away why
[1:32:58] because they can never grasp that over
[1:33:01] and over and over again God is
[1:33:02] expressing hi and you're exceeding great
[1:33:06] reward and they didn't want that they
[1:33:11] wanted loaves and fishes not flesh and
[1:33:13] blood you know they wanted a blessing
[1:33:16] they wanted some tangible thing they
[1:33:18] wanted you know and it reminds me as I'm
[1:33:20] saying this of the the survey they did
[1:33:22] years ago asking athletes that you know
[1:33:24] if you could take some kind of
[1:33:26] performance-enhancing drug that could
[1:33:27] never be you know detected and it made
[1:33:29] you the top of your game for five years
[1:33:32] but took your life would you do it and
[1:33:35] 80 percent said they would do it you
[1:33:37] know what does that tell you he tells
[1:33:38] you that temporary gains are really
[1:33:39] important to people short-term temporary
[1:33:42] gains are very important to people and
[1:33:44] they would sacrifice anything of
[1:33:46] long-term value for a few minutes of
[1:33:48] glory well Jesus Christ is offering us
[1:33:50] an eternity of glory and so many people
[1:33:53] are still so focused on the temporary
[1:33:55] gains and so even the very father of our
[1:33:59] faith when presented with God as the
[1:34:04] true reward immediately reduced it to
[1:34:07] something tangible temporary and yet
[1:34:11] he's the father of our faith we're still
[1:34:13] the spiritual children of Abraham
[1:34:15] because that he was willing to believe
[1:34:17] God and trust in him anyway David we
[1:34:20] know the scripture records
[1:34:23] and after God's own heart he was not
[1:34:25] above natural rewards in fact he was
[1:34:28] motivated by them you know if you read
[1:34:30] David's interaction as he goes to the
[1:34:33] valley or to visit his his brothers who
[1:34:36] are waiting to fight Goliath and the
[1:34:39] troops of the Philistines and you know
[1:34:41] David shows up there with provisions
[1:34:42] from his father and asked him about the
[1:34:44] battle and all those things and he hears
[1:34:45] Goliath challenge you know you know send
[1:34:48] me out a man to fight and and David
[1:34:50] hears that at first Samuel 17 records
[1:34:53] his response and it says David spake to
[1:34:55] the man who stood by him saying what
[1:34:57] shall be done
[1:34:57] to the man that killeth this Philistine
[1:34:59] who taketh away the reproach from Israel
[1:35:01] for who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:35:04] that he should defy the armies of the
[1:35:05] Living God you know we talked about the
[1:35:07] faith that David had it you know you can
[1:35:09] feel that faith a little in the latter
[1:35:11] part of this verse rising to the
[1:35:12] challenge who is this uncircumcised
[1:35:14] Philistine but he started it by saying
[1:35:16] what's the roar like like you know you
[1:35:20] may not know that I've been anointed to
[1:35:22] be King and I have a lot of confidence
[1:35:23] in that and I'm gonna go out here right
[1:35:25] away and I'm gonna try to think of this
[1:35:26] guy but before I do that what's the
[1:35:29] reward you know just just asking like if
[1:35:32] somebody was about to do something you
[1:35:34] know like what kind of blessing could he
[1:35:36] could expect right and so you know David
[1:35:39] is very motivated by rewards you know
[1:35:41] when he hears all this it's like yeah of
[1:35:43] course I'll do this I'm in you know like
[1:35:45] what I get all of this stuff it sounds
[1:35:46] awesome and so you know he steps right
[1:35:49] up and God doesn't disapprove of reward
[1:35:51] or our desire for them that's why he
[1:35:54] gives them to us because he knows that
[1:35:55] they motivate us like I said at the
[1:35:57] beginning if you knew that you strove
[1:35:59] and strove and strove and you never got
[1:36:00] anything for it we'd be so discouraged
[1:36:02] we would never try it so God gives us a
[1:36:04] lot of rewards but he wants to be our
[1:36:07] greatest reward and the reason that we
[1:36:10] live and too often all of those rewards
[1:36:12] cloud that you know God's just so
[1:36:15] generous that we get caught up in those
[1:36:17] rewards and we forget that he's the
[1:36:19] reason that we live he's he's the reason
[1:36:21] that we exist he's the reason that we
[1:36:23] have any of these things and he's the
[1:36:25] only one that we should really be loving
[1:36:26] and trusting in and a focused on all our
[1:36:31] other ambitions and goals are to be
[1:36:32] second to that great goal of having him
[1:36:35] you know if we can keep our eyes on him
[1:36:37] we have no other path than one straight
[1:36:40] to glory you know how how could you miss
[1:36:42] something that you're staring right at
[1:36:43] the whole time you know it's it's when
[1:36:45] you look away right that's what they say
[1:36:48] about distracted driving there's not
[1:36:49] very many people that are you know
[1:36:50] consciously focused on the road and
[1:36:52] looking for obstacles all the time those
[1:36:54] aren't usually the people get an
[1:36:55] accident you know it's the people that
[1:36:56] are taking their eyes off the road their
[1:36:58] check the heater or the radio or check
[1:37:01] their phone or you know talk to somebody
[1:37:02] next to them or do all of those things
[1:37:04] at the same time you know that those are
[1:37:06] the people that are distracted their
[1:37:07] focus isn't where it should be and it
[1:37:10] doesn't take much to come along to catch
[1:37:12] them by surprise and it's the same thing
[1:37:15] if we're looking every day for the will
[1:37:16] of God if we're looking every day for
[1:37:18] what pleases him
[1:37:19] well guess what it's not that hard to
[1:37:20] find them yeah it's not that hard you
[1:37:23] know if we keep our eyes looking at him
[1:37:25] to see him you know a look and live as
[1:37:28] the scripture tells us but it's when we
[1:37:30] take our eyes off of him and God turns a
[1:37:33] corner what are you we're to God go I
[1:37:35] don't know where to find him anymore
[1:37:37] keep our eyes on him keep focused on him
[1:37:41] you know along the way we can live a
[1:37:44] life of abundant blessing and prosperity
[1:37:47] both naturally ends and spiritually and
[1:37:50] still battle everyday you know as David
[1:37:53] has said I delighted in the Lord and he
[1:37:55] gave me the desires of my heart
[1:37:57] sometimes people think that coming to
[1:37:59] Christ means that you're you're
[1:38:00] foregoing everything that you desire
[1:38:01] that's not true at all if we can keep
[1:38:05] our eyes focused on him and have the
[1:38:07] things that we desire then we can have
[1:38:08] both David's greatest sin was when he
[1:38:17] lost his focus man after God's own heart
[1:38:19] you know with this happens to this I was
[1:38:22] the good and bad elected and non-elected
[1:38:25] know he lost his focus he lost his focus
[1:38:29] and he committed more heinous sin than
[1:38:32] you could possibly imagine doing in your
[1:38:34] own life probably and you know it it
[1:38:36] came from when a man after God's own
[1:38:38] heart lost his focus the scripture says
[1:38:41] it was the time of year when Kings go to
[1:38:42] battle but this time of year David
[1:38:45] didn't go out to battle
[1:38:46] David stayed home
[1:38:48] and David had already accomplished a lot
[1:38:50] and God have given him rest rest we
[1:38:52] always say oh if God would just give me
[1:38:54] rest I'll be careful because in rest he
[1:38:56] close your eyes when close your eyes not
[1:38:57] focused when you not focus then bad
[1:38:59] stuff happens sometimes and so in this
[1:39:01] case David you know everybody else goes
[1:39:04] off to battle and David's got a little
[1:39:05] extra free time and of course this is a
[1:39:08] time when David takes Bathsheba and she
[1:39:11] finds out he was with child and has her
[1:39:13] husband Uriah killed off and so God
[1:39:16] doesn't let him get away with that
[1:39:17] although he does a pretty neat job of
[1:39:19] tidying up the loose ends it seems like
[1:39:21] but God sends Nathan the prophet too to
[1:39:24] David and Dei
[1:39:25] you know he presents a little allegory
[1:39:28] totally unrelated you know and then as
[1:39:30] soon as David gives his judgement about
[1:39:32] this this particular situation
[1:39:35] Nathan says to David for second Samuel
[1:39:37] 12 thou art the man it's you what we're
[1:39:41] talking about here that the you just
[1:39:43] gave the judgment that man should be put
[1:39:44] to death
[1:39:45] this is what you deserve he said thou
[1:39:47] art the man thus saith the Lord God of
[1:39:48] Israel i anointed the king over Israel
[1:39:51] and I delivered the out of the hand of
[1:39:52] Saul and I gave thee thy masters house
[1:39:54] and thy masters wives into thy bosom and
[1:39:57] gave me the house of Israel and Judah
[1:40:00] and if that had been too little I would
[1:40:03] have given moreover have given unto
[1:40:04] these such and such things wherefore
[1:40:08] hast thou despised the commandment of
[1:40:10] the Lord to do evil in his sight
[1:40:12] thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with
[1:40:14] the sword and has taken his wife to be
[1:40:15] thy wife and has slain him with the
[1:40:17] sword of the children of Haman what a
[1:40:20] judgment David had been a man after
[1:40:22] God's own heart he had been so focused
[1:40:24] on the Lord from a young man in all his
[1:40:26] life through his successes and his
[1:40:28] failures victories and defeats he had
[1:40:30] stayed amazingly focused you know David
[1:40:33] was one of those men you could say year
[1:40:34] after year after year in good times and
[1:40:37] bad you know as our sister I was saying
[1:40:38] you know he he had his eyes on God alone
[1:40:41] and yet when everything was going well
[1:40:44] when the battles were being won and he
[1:40:46] was established in his kingdom he lost
[1:40:48] his focus he forgot the integrity of his
[1:40:51] God he forgot the main thing he forgot
[1:40:54] the true reward and it caused David to
[1:40:57] take his own reward to make his own way
[1:41:00] here to make his own pride
[1:41:02] and when he did that he brought sin and
[1:41:04] judgment on his house you know I love
[1:41:06] what what God told David through Nathan
[1:41:08] he said I blessed you and multiplied you
[1:41:11] I gave you so much and if you would have
[1:41:15] stayed focused on me depended on me
[1:41:17] approved me I would have given you even
[1:41:19] more you know he said if this would have
[1:41:21] been too little I would have given you
[1:41:24] such and such the scripture doesn't say
[1:41:25] what maybe Nathan laid out for him all
[1:41:27] the things that God would have given him
[1:41:29] you know but I would have given you even
[1:41:32] more but you took your own prize you
[1:41:35] made your own reward you you got your
[1:41:37] own focus now you lost your focus you
[1:41:40] went outside of me to provide for your
[1:41:42] own desires you know the the positive is
[1:41:45] laid out for us all the desires of our
[1:41:47] hearts is possible but our focus needs
[1:41:50] to be right it must be subject to our
[1:41:52] greatest reward which is the love and
[1:41:54] the grace of Almighty God our Creator
[1:41:57] David brought unimaginable conflict into
[1:42:00] his life because of one lapse of focus
[1:42:04] you know you think oh man it was just
[1:42:06] one lapse of focus and then that one
[1:42:09] lapse of focus he brings such judgment
[1:42:11] down on his house sameera semeth 12:10
[1:42:14] tells the the judgment here now
[1:42:16] therefore the sword shall never depart
[1:42:18] from thine house because now it's
[1:42:20] despise me and has taken the wife of
[1:42:22] Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife thus
[1:42:24] saith the Lord behold I will raise up
[1:42:26] evil against the out of thine own house
[1:42:27] and I will take the eyewash before thine
[1:42:30] eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and
[1:42:32] he shall lie with their wives in the
[1:42:33] sight of this son for thou didst it's
[1:42:35] secretly but I will do this thing before
[1:42:39] all Israel and before the son you think
[1:42:43] wow you know David David reaped a lot
[1:42:48] for this one this was a hundredfold
[1:42:49] reaping on this particular showing that
[1:42:52] David did and and you know sometimes you
[1:42:55] might think oh man you know maybe your
[1:42:57] life is a mess of calamity and you might
[1:43:00] blame a lot of people for that one of
[1:43:03] the things that I've really changed in
[1:43:05] my focus is that I'm tired of excuses
[1:43:09] I'm tired of excuses of my own life
[1:43:11] tired of excuses in other people's lives
[1:43:14] because most of the time we
[1:43:16] really boil it down you know to our
[1:43:18] problems and our situations and
[1:43:20] everything else we can blame a lot of
[1:43:22] other people but maybe that blame should
[1:43:24] send her mostly on ourselves right on
[1:43:27] our own shoulders because we're reaping
[1:43:29] the things that we so you know the
[1:43:30] scripture tells us God is not mocked
[1:43:32] whatever so ever a man or so I thought
[1:43:35] shall you reap you know and so if it
[1:43:38] does lay on our shoulders and I'm not
[1:43:39] saying that you know extraordinary
[1:43:41] circumstances don't happen but if it
[1:43:43] lays on our shoulders as it does most of
[1:43:45] the time then the path is pretty simple
[1:43:47] like it was through David thoroughly
[1:43:49] repent and get focused on the main thing
[1:43:52] again
[1:43:53] because David refloating sowed and the
[1:43:56] scripture tells us that we will as well
[1:43:58] but what I love about God and just to
[1:44:01] show us there's never-ending grace is
[1:44:03] that if we get our focus back on him and
[1:44:06] we sow the right things God's able to
[1:44:09] bless and multiply in most cases the
[1:44:11] things that we do well to exceed those
[1:44:13] things that we've done wrong you know to
[1:44:15] exceed you know he can bless some 30
[1:44:18] some thick 60 some 100 fold as he said
[1:44:20] and so I'm so glad that some of those
[1:44:22] negative things you know get blessed a
[1:44:24] little less and those positive things
[1:44:26] get blessed a little more and most of
[1:44:28] the time if you start to put the right
[1:44:29] things in place God will multiply those
[1:44:32] things to exceed even the things that
[1:44:33] that we've done wrong so as we begin to
[1:44:38] close here tonight I just wanted to read
[1:44:40] you some of the testimonies of the truly
[1:44:42] rewarded because as I said to me one of
[1:44:45] the greatest measures if you've received
[1:44:46] the true reward and means could you
[1:44:49] really have God take all of those other
[1:44:51] things away and still be content because
[1:44:53] if he's the true reward that means that
[1:44:55] you've really still got it all and so
[1:44:57] you know could we do that and David is
[1:44:59] one of those people who had that
[1:45:01] experience that when God could take it
[1:45:02] all away you know when he was suffering
[1:45:04] that reaping and when Absalom was taking
[1:45:07] the kingdom and when this one was rising
[1:45:08] up against him when this was happening
[1:45:10] when this was happening you know he did
[1:45:11] it he didn't wonder where God was he
[1:45:13] knew exactly where God was and he kept
[1:45:15] that benefited you know he knew that he
[1:45:18] knew he had put himself in that
[1:45:19] situation but I love what David responds
[1:45:21] here he says whither shall I go from my
[1:45:23] spirit or whither shall I flee from thy
[1:45:25] presence if I ascend up into heaven thou
[1:45:28] art there
[1:45:29] if I make my bed in hell behold thou art
[1:45:32] there the David had such a confidence
[1:45:34] that God was with him
[1:45:36] that God was with his true reward that
[1:45:39] even if he made his bed in hell most
[1:45:42] people wouldn't expect God to be there
[1:45:43] you know they expect the devil to be
[1:45:45] there but they wouldn't expect God to be
[1:45:46] there but Damon had such a confidence in
[1:45:49] God being with him that he said if I
[1:45:50] make my bed in hell they are with me you
[1:45:54] know though I'm sitting here you know on
[1:45:56] the run from Absalom though I'm you know
[1:45:59] just just a rivers crossing from losing
[1:46:01] my life and yet you know I'm going to
[1:46:03] I'm going to still put my trust in here
[1:46:06] this hell that I'm experiencing right
[1:46:07] now I know God still with me that takes
[1:46:10] a great great confidence and his walk
[1:46:12] with God you know he says in another
[1:46:14] place of course Psalm 23 said though I
[1:46:15] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:46:17] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:46:20] with me you know and if you read a
[1:46:23] little further it says thy rod and thy
[1:46:25] staff they come from me rodimus staff
[1:46:27] weren't there to give him a big hug you
[1:46:29] know the shepherds were out of the
[1:46:30] Shepherd stuff we're there for some
[1:46:32] correction they were there for the odd
[1:46:34] beating they were there for a poke and a
[1:46:35] prod when he you know and the sheep's
[1:46:37] done wrong and yet David said they
[1:46:38] comfort me you know that sharp rebuke
[1:46:42] from the pulpit it comforts me because
[1:46:44] it tells me God's with me and he loves
[1:46:46] me and he wants me to draw closer to him
[1:46:48] you know size me has be closed let's
[1:46:50] hear the testimonies of some of the
[1:46:52] others who received the true reward job
[1:46:54] was one of those you know Jobe went
[1:46:56] through a great suffering so that God
[1:46:58] could show him that he was job's true
[1:47:00] reward you know Joe med had been given
[1:47:03] so many things he was such a respected
[1:47:05] man because he had wisdom and he had
[1:47:06] money and he had servants and he had to
[1:47:09] accomplish so much God took it all away
[1:47:11] and Joe proved that the character that
[1:47:14] was inside of him could still love God
[1:47:16] in spite of that you know could still
[1:47:17] trust God inside of the in spite of that
[1:47:19] and it says in job 120 it says after
[1:47:22] losing everything Joe arose and rent his
[1:47:24] mantle and shaved his head and fell down
[1:47:26] upon the ground and worshiped and said
[1:47:28] naked came out of my mother's womb and
[1:47:30] naked shall I return hither the Lord
[1:47:32] gave and the LORD hath taken away
[1:47:34] blessed be the name of the Lord in all
[1:47:37] this job sin not North charged God
[1:47:40] foolishly
[1:47:44] twelve chapters later says though he
[1:47:48] slay me yeah well I trust in him but
[1:47:51] I'll maintain my own ways before him you
[1:47:55] know job the one thing job didn't
[1:47:56] understand is that he thought God was
[1:47:58] punishing him unfairly he just didn't
[1:48:00] realize what God was trying to
[1:48:02] accomplish right but but he said you
[1:48:04] know I'll maintain my own ways before
[1:48:05] job we've got a little more confidence
[1:48:07] and B did he knew he had done you know
[1:48:09] you've been faithful he'd been he'd been
[1:48:10] true but he said though he slay me yeah
[1:48:14] well I trusted him that's a that's a
[1:48:16] pretty harsh thing you know and in
[1:48:18] amazingly enough I believe that's what
[1:48:20] you're I the hittites testimony would be
[1:48:22] one day is that though David slayed him
[1:48:24] yeah he had a it was his pleasure to
[1:48:27] serve an army of David I believe he
[1:48:29] would say and that shows a greater
[1:48:31] character in Uriah than it did in David
[1:48:33] in that moment but that's that's really
[1:48:35] the the true character of a Christian is
[1:48:38] that it's not based on what God's does
[1:48:42] to me because God's given me everything
[1:48:44] that I have and then invert chapter 19
[1:48:47] verse 25 it says for I know that my
[1:48:49] Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand
[1:48:51] at the latter day upon the earth and
[1:48:53] though after my skin worms destroy this
[1:48:56] body yet in my flesh shall I see God you
[1:49:00] know there was no written word for that
[1:49:02] job just wrote it right there you know
[1:49:04] there was no written word that said that
[1:49:06] he had that promise but he knew in
[1:49:08] himself that he would be with God
[1:49:10] because God was his true reward the
[1:49:15] Apostle Paul is a great testimony you
[1:49:18] know he Paul went through a lot of
[1:49:20] things you might say Paul had a great
[1:49:24] testimony and you know on the surface
[1:49:27] you might say yeah we would all love a
[1:49:28] testimony like Paul wouldn't we and then
[1:49:30] we start to think about what that would
[1:49:31] actually entail it doesn't sound quite
[1:49:33] so good because Paul lays out you know a
[1:49:35] couple times Paul lays out for us the
[1:49:37] extent of his testimony and it really
[1:49:39] doesn't sound that much fun he says of
[1:49:41] the Jews five times I received forty
[1:49:43] stripes save one thrice was i beaten
[1:49:46] with rods once was i stoned thrice I
[1:49:48] suffered shipwreck a night in the day I
[1:49:50] have been in the deep in journeyings
[1:49:53] often in perils of waters
[1:49:55] in perils of robbers in perils by my own
[1:49:57] countrymen in perils by the heathen in
[1:50:00] perils in the city in perils in the
[1:50:03] wilderness in perils in the sea in
[1:50:05] perils among false brethren in weariness
[1:50:08] and painfulness and watchings often in
[1:50:11] hunger and a thirst in fastings often in
[1:50:14] cold and nakedness man Paul must have
[1:50:17] been a bad guy to reap all of these
[1:50:18] things well God told him and I'll show
[1:50:24] them the things he must need suffer
[1:50:26] right beside those things that were are
[1:50:30] without that which cometh upon me daily
[1:50:34] the care of all the churches who is weak
[1:50:37] and I'm not weak who is offended and I
[1:50:39] burn not if I must need glory I will
[1:50:42] glory of the things which concern my
[1:50:44] infirmities you know Paul had a lot of
[1:50:48] things he could have been complaining
[1:50:50] about he had a lot of things that he
[1:50:52] could have been crying about you know I
[1:50:55] sure hope that God you know remembers me
[1:50:57] and all of his terrible things that I'm
[1:50:59] going through but Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:51:01] 37 tells us what what Paul really
[1:51:04] thought after going through all of those
[1:51:05] things he said nay in all these things
[1:51:08] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:51:11] that loved us for I am persuaded that
[1:51:14] neither death nor life nor Angels nor
[1:51:17] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:51:19] present nor things to come nor height
[1:51:22] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:51:25] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:51:27] God which is in Christ Jesus our what a
[1:51:33] man who had gone through all of those
[1:51:34] things to realize that there is
[1:51:37] absolutely nothing that can separate you
[1:51:40] from the love of God what a confidence
[1:51:44] you know and that's one thing I would
[1:51:45] say is that you know having to go
[1:51:47] through something I don't understand all
[1:51:49] the time or that I don't I don't know
[1:51:51] which way it's going to turn out yet I
[1:51:52] just trusting in God's faithfulness to
[1:51:55] me and and whatever way he wants that's
[1:51:57] the way I want to go but but but what
[1:52:00] you realize is when you're willing to
[1:52:01] accept God's will in all situations it
[1:52:03] doesn't matter how good things are going
[1:52:05] for you to still be able to say the same
[1:52:07] thing
[1:52:08] that I know that God's there with me no
[1:52:10] matter what what the situation is
[1:52:12] brother Brown tells us a story he's one
[1:52:15] of those ones that lent his voice to say
[1:52:17] that no matter what God does I'll still
[1:52:19] take him he says in his citizen Grand
[1:52:22] Prairie actually Alberta in 1961 it is I
[1:52:25] he said but I might not live to hear
[1:52:28] that but there's one thing I do want to
[1:52:30] hear and I believe I'll hear it it was
[1:52:32] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:52:34] enter into the joys of the Lord that's
[1:52:38] what I'm expecting to hear someday I'm
[1:52:41] sure he won't disappoint me so we could
[1:52:43] stop right there and say you know he's
[1:52:45] got faith that God is a rewarder of
[1:52:47] those that diligently seek Him
[1:52:49] but it shows you how much he sold out to
[1:52:52] the true reward by this next paragraph
[1:52:55] and he says and if he does turn me down
[1:52:57] at the end of the road I'll still love
[1:53:00] him if he sends me to hell and I can
[1:53:04] still love in hell I'll love him anyhow
[1:53:07] see because I deserve to be turned down
[1:53:10] at the beginning see and if I had 10,000
[1:53:14] lives to live this is such a profound
[1:53:17] statement if I had 10,000 lives to live
[1:53:20] and there's nothing after the end of
[1:53:23] them if there was no God no Christ I'd
[1:53:28] still take this Christian way to live
[1:53:30] anyhow there's a man that his life is
[1:53:36] made of the very fiber of God's work and
[1:53:42] that's what I'd say to you tonight is
[1:53:44] that you know compared to these ones in
[1:53:47] the scripture I'm nothing and I'm nobody
[1:53:48] but I believe that with all my heart
[1:53:50] that if you took it all away if we took
[1:53:53] everything all the blessings if there
[1:53:55] was no more rewards other than himself
[1:53:57] I still stand in praising Hebrews 11:6
[1:54:03] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:54:06] him for he that cometh to God must
[1:54:08] believe that he is and that he's a
[1:54:11] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:54:13] him but seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:54:18] six and his righteousness and all these
[1:54:21] things shall be added unto you
[1:54:23] he's a rewarder he'd be faithful to us
[1:54:26] through to the end
[1:54:27] but our attention our love everything
[1:54:30] else needs to be concentrated on him
[1:54:32] Jesus parable of the man who found a
[1:54:35] treasure in a field it says he went and
[1:54:38] sold everything he had to buy that
[1:54:40] treasure you know and God is you know
[1:54:43] God himself Jesus Christ is the example
[1:54:45] of that parable because you know he
[1:54:47] found a treasure in an earthen vessel
[1:54:49] you know he saw treasures in in our
[1:54:51] lives he saw you know deposits of
[1:54:53] himself that he put in our lives and he
[1:54:54] went and gave everything he had his very
[1:54:56] life on Calvary to obtain that treasure
[1:55:00] but that parable also applies to us you
[1:55:04] know we're digging around in this field
[1:55:05] of this earth and we found a treasure we
[1:55:08] found Almighty God we found we found in
[1:55:11] this message in this word in his life
[1:55:13] that there's there's an everlasting life
[1:55:15] there's a spirit of god there's a Holy
[1:55:17] Ghost to be found and so that the
[1:55:19] compulsion in our lives is sell
[1:55:22] everything that you guys there's one
[1:55:24] true reward it might be a bunch of other
[1:55:27] fringe benefits but there's one true
[1:55:28] reward well we sell all that we have and
[1:55:32] we might find that one treasure a man
[1:55:35] let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father
[1:55:38] you are our true reward and Lord should
[1:55:43] we suffer should we be blessed Lord we
[1:55:47] can say that through it all though you
[1:55:49] slay us yet we'll trust in you lord the
[1:55:54] Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed
[1:55:56] be the name of the Lord Lord if you take
[1:55:59] it all away if at the end of the journey
[1:56:00] you would still send us away Lord we
[1:56:03] don't believe you will because you're a
[1:56:04] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:56:06] you but Lord we'll love you anyhow will
[1:56:10] serve you anyhow Lord it father we just
[1:56:13] are so grateful for the life the breath
[1:56:16] that you put in these bodies Lord we
[1:56:18] thank you that there's an opportunity to
[1:56:20] be a reflection of your will and your
[1:56:22] way to this world and I pray father then
[1:56:25] we could see on this Good Friday that
[1:56:27] that you did not die in vain that you
[1:56:29] did not die without
[1:56:31] reward coming to you Lord but we humble
[1:56:34] people here tonight though we're part of
[1:56:37] that reaping that you sowed when you
[1:56:38] that corn of wheat fell on the ground
[1:56:40] over a part of that harvest that's grown
[1:56:43] up to be a reflection of your very
[1:56:45] character and life Lord and we're so
[1:56:47] grateful for the sacrifice you made so
[1:56:49] we could be here today praising you Lord
[1:56:51] so we could be here today living for you
[1:56:53] father make me you make us so aware that
[1:56:56] we would treasure every moment that we
[1:56:58] would look to make more of our time Lord
[1:57:01] that we would look more to make more of
[1:57:03] our walk with you Lord realizing that
[1:57:05] that's the most important thing father
[1:57:08] we just thank you for these things thank
[1:57:09] you for the lives that came here tonight
[1:57:11] and we're so attentive Lord and I pray
[1:57:13] you'd bless them abundantly Lord and in
[1:57:15] blessings and trials or whatever it
[1:57:18] takes to bring them into the position
[1:57:19] you have in mind for them Lord we commit
[1:57:22] each one into your care in Jesus name
[1:57:26] and let's stand together sing I love him
[1:57:36] I love him because he first loved me
[1:57:42] if you hadn't first loved us we wouldn't
[1:57:44] be here you know if he hadn't first
[1:57:48] loved us we wouldn't know the grace that
[1:57:49] he has but because he did and because he
[1:57:52] you know before we even started down the
[1:57:55] journey we already knew we already knew
[1:57:58] he'd gone and saved our souls we already
[1:58:00] knew you'd already have a place prepared
[1:58:01] for us it's been working on right on

[2:02:40] himself the grace of God and it was good

[2:03:18] withers in Luther's day West we stay the
[2:03:21] Pentecostal age and other revivals so
[2:03:23] there's now an A in the our that we're
[2:03:25] living and in the message that we're
[2:03:27] living under that is that the people are
[2:03:30] losing their focus on what God has done
[2:03:33] and losing their focus on what God is
[2:03:36] doing
[2:03:36] amen we need to get into the into the
[2:03:40] revelation of the ever-present God amen
[2:03:43] we believe what he has done and we
[2:03:46] believe what he's going to do but is he
[2:03:48] doing it amen let's let's let's get our
[2:03:51] focus back in line with the scriptures
[2:03:55] let's get our focus back in line with
[2:03:57] what God is doing

[2:04:43] over Israel

[2:04:51] what you mean don't tell me that the
[2:04:54] whole nation and the whole army of
[2:04:56] Israel couldn't defeat them but here

[2:05:32] with him that's good brother amen the
[2:05:35] kind of little little revelation strike
[2:05:37] home to us because it was David that

[2:06:00] what would God are expecting us amen in
[2:06:04] this hour
[2:06:04] seeing what God has done in the enemy in
[2:06:07] the Ministry of Malachi 4 and so on and

[2:06:12] doing in our lives
[2:06:14] Oh God give us that faith oh let us save
[2:06:18] that faith just think of it a young man

[2:06:34] make us look look and look foolish in
[2:06:36] the eyes of the world they want to make
[2:06:38] him look foolish you know and says you
[2:06:40] know here's old all the hell the whole
[2:06:43] nation the whole army and they can't go
[2:06:45] to defeat that that made them there
[2:06:48] because they were good they were they
[2:06:50] lost their focus on God that's the truth
[2:06:52] brother
[2:06:53] they lost their focus on God who could
[2:06:56] conquer any enemy amen David didn't
[2:06:59] hallelujah he listened that they should
[2:07:02] have realized what God had done to
[2:07:04] Israel and what God was doing with
[2:07:06] Israel as David remember what God had
[2:07:09] done with him a man he was not a king
[2:07:12] over Israel he was as as a young man but
[2:07:15] he said God delivered me out of the line
[2:07:18] out of the hand of the jaw
[2:07:19] the mouth of the lion
[2:07:21] and the paws of the bear and what about
[2:07:26] this Scalia well the bear had no sword
[2:07:29] the veteran of the berry and the lion
[2:07:32] had no shields and none of these things
[2:07:35] but still that didn't matter today but a
[2:07:37] man you know why he was because David
[2:07:41] David was identified with the covenant
[2:07:45] of abraham a mani and the token here the
[2:07:49] token and he believed God any anybody
[2:07:52] think he never lost the focus on on on
[2:07:54] the Covenant and the token a made a God
[2:07:58] that was with Abraham was was with David
[2:08:00] amen the God delivered Abraham would
[2:08:02] deliver David praise the name of the
[2:08:05] Lord God elbows rather just to think
[2:08:08] that young man he believed that David
[2:08:13] you got to be crazy we're all the net
[2:08:16] all the armies of Israel and and you you
[2:08:19] think you could go down there and we
[2:08:21] can't a man you got to go down by faith
[2:08:25] don't take the modern ways of this world
[2:08:28] because as I said Satan this again we're
[2:08:30] back to Eden again and Satan that is
[2:08:33] getting us to trying to get us to the
[2:08:35] tree of knowledge of good and evil amen
[2:08:37] that's what's going on instead of
[2:08:41] believing God trusting God good brother
[2:08:45] getting brought out about Cain and Abel
[2:08:48] amen that you've got to take your stand
[2:08:51] as Abel took in Spain but it but it's
[2:08:53] going to going to bring problems
[2:09:01] oh yeah he said God he said God God
[2:09:05] rewards someone and it causes hostility
[2:09:11] is that what you said yeah God reward
[2:09:14] somebody and causes hostility I got a
[2:09:17] reward David got a you know and David
[2:09:20] went out and gave his testimony and they
[2:09:22] became out our style toward David they
[2:09:25] were even in even his own family and so
[2:09:27] on but he stayed with the promise
[2:09:31] amen by the grace of Almighty God and it
[2:09:35] says it was like Abel and Cain God read
[2:09:38] God rewarded Abel why isn't it God God
[2:09:42] took your sacrifice and wouldn't take
[2:09:44] mine this is right Saints has got to be
[2:09:47] according to the will of God and a right
[2:09:49] spirit and a right attitude that's what
[2:09:52] God looks for anybody no matter how much
[2:09:56] we say we believe is we believe that and
[2:09:59] we believe something else you got to
[2:10:01] have the right attitude and right spirit
[2:10:03] amen because that's what brings God on
[2:10:05] the scene a man and gives us faith all
[2:10:09] brother don't please I beg of you in the
[2:10:12] name of the Lord let the holy spirit
[2:10:14] bring to your remembrance tonight let's
[2:10:17] Holy Spirit bring to your remembrance

[2:10:21] us tonight what God gave us God sent him
[2:10:24] here it was predestinated thousands of
[2:10:27] years ago God for attainted God knew was
[2:10:31] going to be brother maybe the brother to
[2:10:35] wait on the Lord to know what the breach
[2:10:36] and God already knew it a man before the
[2:10:40] brother came into existence before any
[2:10:42] must came into existence God knew what
[2:10:45] our brother Brandon was going to breach
[2:10:47] and say Amen it was God going to be God
[2:10:50] in him it was what it was faith it was
[2:10:54] his faith in God getting himself out of
[2:10:56] the way so Jesus could speak a man so
[2:11:02] god help us brother by grace to believe
[2:11:07] to have that faith that was a wonderful
[2:11:10] wonderful examples of faith
[2:11:12] a man do you have that faith order you
[2:11:16] works it out you do this you do that you
[2:11:19] planned this you planned that are we led
[2:11:22] by the spirit as David was as Abel was
[2:11:25] as the other Saints in the scriptures
[2:11:28] did Joel there's like I said we can
[2:11:34] barely do with one funeral
[2:11:36] Joel bed I said seven one time Joel bed
[2:11:39] Cain yeah you question God why God it's
[2:11:46] just like when my brother just passed
[2:11:48] away just a couple of weeks ago and and
[2:11:52] somebody they're standing at the coffin
[2:11:54] said why why did he go so young how old
[2:11:59] was he 72 and they want to know why why
[2:12:04] why would you know why would God take
[2:12:06] him at such a young age you know where's
[2:12:10] faith trusting the Lord leave it with
[2:12:14] the Lord committed to the Lord
[2:12:16] job and again I was thinking about it
[2:12:18] when when I heard that question and I
[2:12:20] was I didn't I I felt as if to say it
[2:12:22] but I didn't say anything I thought well
[2:12:25] I said lord I was your servant job at 10
[2:12:27] funerals in one time and only that all
[2:12:31] brother comes right back to what our
[2:12:33] brothers saying oh my oh my what God
[2:12:37] gives and what God doesn't give that was
[2:12:40] good that was good
[2:12:42] just think God give this 110 this whole
[2:12:46] five or five whatever and this one one
[2:12:48] Oh Lord you preferred the others over me

[2:13:03] but he can trust you with amen brother
[2:13:07] God knows what he can trust us with oh

[2:13:13] to expand it and multiply it there what
[2:13:16] was said tonight in your heart and soul
[2:13:18] and that it will humble us
[2:13:21] a man so that we are the sons and
[2:13:25] daughters of God humblest Lord to Abel I
[2:13:30] don't know if I would want that to you

[2:15:06] believe God and go on and do what you

[2:15:14] scripture says forsake not the
[2:15:15] assembling of yourselves together and
[2:15:17] much more as you see the Day approaching
[2:15:21] much more who's going in the rapture
[2:15:29] I pray God make this word and this
[2:15:33] message real to us tonight the true
[2:15:37] reward by the grace of God into our
[2:15:41] hearts and souls and God bless you
[2:15:47] and regarding Easter we don't need
[2:15:54] Easter remind us of what Jesus did Jesus
[2:16:01] said in the church the emblems of his
[2:16:06] shed blood and broken body
[2:16:08] he said do this in remembrance of me
[2:16:11] he didn't say keep Easter in remembrance
[2:16:14] of me
[2:16:15] he said do this that's why the Father
[2:16:19] God said if you don't take the communion
[2:16:20] of foot washing
[2:16:21] he said you got no part with him amen so
[2:16:27] there got serious that's serious
[2:16:29] I believe Abel took it that serious and
[2:16:32] he was willing to make that sacrifice
[2:16:34] I believe job took her that serious in
[2:16:36] and in all that situation brother losing
[2:16:39] ten children to one time he didn't say
[2:16:42] nothing about God he didn't blame God he
[2:16:47] just he said God God is just and so on
[2:16:50] god help us brother and our brother
[2:16:54] brought out it but Paul and all that
[2:16:56] Paul and went through and when he went
[2:16:58] ask God about it what did God tell him
[2:17:01] he said Lord this this and this God said
[2:17:04] Paul my grace is sufficient for you god
[2:17:08] help us
[2:17:09] this is serious I pray that that the
[2:17:13] reward is more more real to us than what
[2:17:17] God asked us to do amen what we're going
[2:17:21] to get it's going to be more real than
[2:17:25] what we do it again because Jesus has
[2:17:27] paid the price a man thank God for
[2:17:31] Calvary thank God for the finished work
[2:17:35] of Calvary
[2:17:39] that's what it's kept them all down
[2:17:41] through the ages and that's what has
[2:17:42] kept us and that's what's taking us back
[2:17:45] to glory amen
[2:17:47] let's sing god bless you be in prayer
[2:17:56] for the service tomorrow night and God
[2:17:59] bless our brother Brandon again tomorrow
[2:18:01] night
[2:18:03] listening I remember Calvary by the
[2:18:07] grace of God where he may lead me I will
[2:18:10] go for I have learned to trust him soul
[2:18:16] trust him is able trust him as David
[2:18:19] trust him as job and and as Paul and I
[2:18:25] remember twice for me it was for you it
[2:18:29] was for me that he was slain on Calvary
[2:18:32] Jesus shall lead me not me
[2:18:35] lead Jesus Jesus leading me to the great
[2:18:40] reward the true reward Jesus shall lead
[2:18:43] me night and day Jesus shall lead me all
[2:18:45] the way is the truest friend to me for I
[2:18:50] remember Calvary praise the name of the
[2:18:54] Lord God bless your listening and will

[2:23:11] amen praise the Lord Amen I was thinking
[2:23:16] you know when you've probably
[2:23:18] experienced this yourself but when I'm
[2:23:22] preparing a song service and sometimes
[2:23:24] the night before or whatever you know I
[2:23:27] wait on the Lord I do ask God by grace
[2:23:30] to help me to sing the right things you
[2:23:33] know write songs and a lot of times I'll
[2:23:35] just shout a few down for after and
[2:23:39] sometimes brother Jerry when he's
[2:23:40] preaching or another brother yourself we
[2:23:44] get out from preach and bang songs of
[2:23:47] course it's not coming you know cuz you
[2:23:48] I kind of find leave it to God and
[2:23:51] that's what happened tonight but just
[2:23:53] song after song of course after course
[2:23:55] every because based on the word it's
[2:23:57] based on and what's preached so I want
[2:24:00] to sing tonight 685 and then it's wings
[2:24:04] of faith
[2:24:06] so it's this thing that tonight because
[2:24:09] that's what this is all about it's about
[2:24:11] faith it's about God helping us to rise
[2:24:14] under wings of faith and go right into
[2:24:17] his presence
[2:24:18] Amen that's where we want to go
[2:24:20] sometimes the way down here gets rough
