[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's right amen and we thank God for grace or those that have been affected by the wind and rainstorm in the Bahamas and eastern United States Lanta Canada so we thank God for His grace to us a man in preserving us from it but we pray grace to those that have been afflicted affected by it and remembering of course the Saints down down through the United States and into the Bahamas and also to remember our brother George Smith it was supposed to be ministry in Fredericton today and of course they were also touched with the storm so he pray grace to our brother George amen and as he ministers again this morning I would assume also this evening so god bless them as they gather trusting God's grace and they'll be gathered together for the hearing of the word a man and also of course too we must consider these things not just thinking no this is just something that happened but believing that it's a sign of the end when it comes to these storms and all of us taking place a man as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in those days brother sister when when they were experiencing the judgment of God a man and hunter this that the world's experiencing God's judgment even now and as I've said before a number of times that I can see the fires falling amen the fire of judgment is falling the fire of God's wrath is falling upon a world a man that has turned him down upon a world that has rejected God and the more caught up with themselves than they are the Lord the more cut out with man and politics and and yes and even religion more they're caught up more with that than they are with this right here man the Word of God it's the truth brother it's the word of the church but they're not considering the Word of God so grace to me grace to you help us to focus more and more on the word because whatever is whatever is happening in the world today no matter where it's happening it's brother it's got to be prophecy fulfilled amen and the Bible says when you see this when you see this they see this he says look up he because your Redemption draws nigh and many are looking up amen most are still looking at out there they're looking right there oh this is happening that's happening yell but let's look at the word and have yet you see it in the word you're gonna look up because you know it's the end amen than it is the end of all things so the grace of God be with us don't it's going to have the desired effect God's effect on us and on you and me Amen brothers sister but again if it's good if what's going on in the world it's going to have the desired effect on us what God wants to have on us with there is a certain thing that we've got to have a man and we're going to get into that as we go into the word again and back to the message I have heard but now I see because there's a couple of things there that brother Bama is highlighted and not just as I preached on it hearing the way God hears it seeing the way God sees it or hearing the way God wants you to hear it are seeing the way God wants you to see it but whether barrel highlights there's another there's another thing that God is looking for in you and in me a man so I pray God brother brother we got to have it and the probability of highlighting this yeah he because why because he knew that the people who was ministering to never had it a man and he brings out this and he brings out that I wonder I like that there's a certain situation there and and they all they just didn't do it when God wanted him to do it and then and they thought old world brother bit him I want you to do this no no no he said I'm not gonna do that he said God has already told me I've already told you but he says you didn't act on it a man when you should have acted on it you didn't do this when you should have done it he says so he said I'm not going to ask God about it no more and he said I'm certainly not interested in it but but they were interested but again we'll get into it what was their motive and what was their objective and what is your motive and what is your objective for being here today a man what is your motive an objective for saying I believe the message so the father of God highlights the wrong motive and the wrong objective or they're lacking the right motive and the right objective a man so brothers and any and if there's anything that he brings out in that message is anything we ought to catch in that message is that revelation is my motive rate is my objective rate a man it's got to be for the glory of God a man not just for Aaron's selfish benefits but it's for the glory of God a man because the Prophet I brings out some things there and he said all they want God to do this for and all they wanted that for there's a certain blessing that the Prophet said go and he said and do this and look for this and then there's a blessing there but they did they waited for their time a man and they lost it a man they come back to the Prophet to do this to do that no he said I'm not going to do it he said I told yes he's her brother round you did but he said we didn't do it he said when when when you want us to do it and so they lost it oh yeah a tremendous blessing but they lost it and the people of the world got it oh yeah because they acted when the believer refused to act a man so I'll show you those things shortly a man though the grace of God be with us brother it is serious this is this is more serious than just just religion this is more serious than just oh goddess and a prophet but brother some probably brings that again in the message he said God does this and God does that he said to test you and he said bring her what she knew he made and he bring out the true anointing and true bird spiritus in the bright but he bring out the false anointing that's in the it's in the make believer and he warns us again and he did he did that in the message on lean not to your own understanding on Wednesday what that there's three kinds of believers which one you a man and it's like a Hindley like I told you about the brother that that he mailed me one time and says look he said sir he said I read the Bible three times and he said I find so many mistakes on it he said I don't believe it so he said I don't believe in this I don't believe in that and and so on and I say brother you failed I said to understand that God wrote the Bible in the way that he wrote it for a reason amen why I sister bring out I said the true believer bring out the mate believer and the make make manifest the unbeliever and I said I said which one are you I said you're you're one of them and they never come back but I trust by the grace of God he went back to the word a man so brother sister see God is testing you so what we and all that we have gone through in the last number of years what has God brought it in you a man what is God made manifest in you what has God seen in you and seen in me a man so I pray the grace of God we're gonna see whether the Prophet is emphasizing in the message I have heard but now I see so I trust a garlic God hears us a man and God sees us a man as sons and daughters of God a man not as religious people but as these sons and daughters a man that he knew before the foundation of the world and he put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen that's Bible that's the Word of God a man and in time God brings out the manifestation of sanctions a male that we are his children but not none there were not brother Branham children amen we're the seed and the children of God that the Lord sent the Prophet to get our attention a man grace Lewis brother so be in prayer as we'll get getting to end of this sermon and then end the notes and other things in just a little while but also to to remind you that the Lord willing I'd like to get into the communion service and usually of course during the summertime if the things are coming and going so maybe the Lord willing I'm not sure we'll see maybe to have communion maybe next Sunday so being prayer and the grace of God but we're gonna do what God wants us to do when God wants us to do it where God wants us to do it our God wants us to do it a man it's not my will it's his will a man by the grace of God so God elbows that we are dead to ourselves while we're alive to him but there's too many believers are still alive to themselves amen but you're the bride of Christ you're alive to him a man you're dead to yourself but a life to the Lord Jesus Christ and also to thank God for His grace to our brother Eric I believe it is and his wife that is in Nova Scotia a man and they are with our brother Ellie and sister Lily and to those that received the email from our brother Marc a man is the confirmation that all is well with them during the storm that struck Nova Scotia occur god bless them a man and God rest sister Lilia and brother Ellie they may praise the Lord and also to remind you that I did promise it and I finally got to it and this is the notes of brother Marc sermon that he preached on what keeps me and so on and so it's a it's a couple of pages I didn't put any staple in it but it's two pages so and I don't know where the stapler is right now and so there be copies for you to pick up outside a man so the grace of God be with you and the Lord bless you amen this Dana's saying only believe all things are possible only be me Oh [Music] only me all things are possible Oh Oh [Music] Oh for fainter hearts Allah only fulfill dreams first all fake man must believe that Jesus is here a man is with you is with me hallelujah hallelujah Jesus is the slaves all

we believe the English smile this Hey everything we need to believe and in the race mr. day hey Rachel doc a man now [Music] we believe that all things are possible [Music] [Applause] amen praise the Lord god bless you turn with me to the book of Proverbs chapter three the book of Proverbs chapter three amen this was the text that brother Brown use in the message on Missy yeah I have heard but now I see proverbs chapter three verse one my son forget not in my law but led by an art keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they head to thee let not mercy and truth forsake thee buying them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shalt thou find favor a man favored and good understanding a man we need the grace of God but we need understanding he said in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart a man not part of it but all of it trusts in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding amen the game was the message lean not to your understanding amen but there's too many that's leaning to their own understanding too many they're getting the glory to themselves I know this I know that I see this and I see that brother if we are the seed of God we know what God has revealed to us it's God giving us the revelation is God giving us the understanding and it says so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man but you're giving God the preeminence for giving God the glory and verse live trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding there's too many babe basing everything that they do on their own understanding no brothers sisters got to be God's understanding and the prophet of God brings that out again in the message on I have heard but now I see they didn't do it exactly the way that God wanted them to do it they didn't do it when God wanted them to do it they did it in their time they did it their way a man and really they were looking for attention for themselves but not for the Lord it is to give the glory to God and atella be sloth and it says in all thy ways this is tremendous in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths a man but how many of us are acknowledging God he and all that we do amen brother you got to consult the Lord in all things a man it's not you making a decision I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that what is God's will for your life what is God's leadership in your life a man and brother oh my if we're born again it's not me that lives this Christ liveth in me and it's Christ lives in you and it's crazy living in you then he controls your thoughts your emotions your feelings he controls everything that you do amen it's not me that lives this Christ I live within me this is a tremendous statement so be not wise in your own eyes you don't make decisions you let God make the decision amen you made the decision to accept Christ amen and receive Christ into your life but once you once he comes into your life and into your heart then it's you're not living as him a man what you do is his leadership the anointing in you by the grace of God oh my the wisdom of God in you praise the name of the Lord so he said in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path be not wise in your own eyes don't give the glory to yourself give the glory to God a man but for the grace of God we wouldn't see what we see we wouldn't know what we know a man will give the glory to him and it says fear the Lord and depart from evil a man grace was as he said it shall be health to thy navel marrow to thy bones honor the Lord with thy substance and the first fruits of all thine increase a man give the glory to God god bless you may be seated turn with me to Psalms chapter 6 no Psalms chapter our proverb from story proverbs chapter four fathers chapter four and verse five get wisdom get understanding we can have wisdom to know this to know that to know the message but brother how much understanding do we have a man if there's anything we need with the wisdom that God gives us we need understanding a man so it's going to reflect in us is going to produce the life that God wants it to produce in you and me a man they comes by hearing and hearing by the word a man but it takes more than the wisdom of the word we got to have the understanding of the word a man and faith is Revelation faith is understanding and it is not me in my in my intellectual knowledge but it's the revelation of God in my heart a man's not in our heads and again we got to make sure that we have we have the calling of God in our hearts we have the revelation of God in our hearts we have the message in our hearts but not in our heads there's so many got it in their heads but there's not in their hearts and I know that by the life that they're living and I know that because why because it's not it is not in control of their life it's not governing them to do this or to do this in God's time no no they're going to they're going they're going to make the decisions and they're going to do it in during their time doing the way they want to do it do it how they want to do it where they want to do it and when they want to do it no no if we're dead to ourselves and alive to God and we're born again and God is in us in our hearts and the Providence bringer that either in this message lean not to your own understanding or I have heard but now I see that he brings out the revelation that has got to be God in your heart and if you were born again he said is God in your heart and he said if God is not in your heart he said you're not born again a man so I trust that we are born again and the evidence of it is God in our hearts controlling the lives that we live controlling what we do and how we do it when we do it and where we do it amen so it's not me now it's Christ in me it's not you it is Christ in you amen this is absolutely a tremendous responsibility and it is - what is to die you ourselves and become alive to him amen and I die to ourselves so that it is not me making the decision since Christ in me making the decisions it's not me deciding this or deciding that is Christ in me making that decision and well god help us more that brother that you're the life that you are living and the job that you are doing and what you do it and how you do it and where you do it brother is not it's not your choice it's God in you a man praise the name of this is tremendous my brother we go back to the scriptures right again right from Genesis right on through the revelation it is God in control a man and as God Shalit challenged Cain in the book of Genesis if they do as well well they'll also be accepted but for it super-k to do well he had to submit himself to the leadership of God so that is not is not Cain and it would be God Enki amen but God wasn't in came because Cain didn't want that kind of leadership enabled it and that's the way that Abel had basically died to himself and become alive to the will of God he wanted the revelation of the will of God what is it that I what I what do I have to do Lord so I can get back in the fellowship with you again and whatever I had to do Lord from that I what I do is say can please God a man so he went out and he do this now Cain didn't agree with that a man because to him it was it wasn't a clean religion what for the glutton what kind of religion is sad to go and kill that they that lamb that doesn't make sense where brother he had a revelation of why he needed to do it a man when it comes to the shedding of blood a man he knew listen all we could get back into the original sin and brother Aeterna there's the original sin caused blood to be shed a man exactly I trust you have the understanding I don't have to say it from the pulpit but you have the understanding of the blood that was shed in the original sin monetarily they said that that a Abel he had sufficient revelation and again like I said maybe care maybe Adam and Eve had went and told him exactly what went on in the Garden of Eden and why this happened why that happened and when eventually why God put him out of the garden amen and so it so Abel walked away with a revelation a man that if that God was going to require this kind of a sacrifice it was going to require a blood sacrifice but Cain he went away and he thought well well God is going to go be satisfied with his sacrifice I did this and I did that and I know I grew I grew all of the all of these vegetables I grew maybe they need these fruits and I don't know what it what else he had there but that's what s what Cain came and offered to the Lord it was the works of his hands yeah exactly amen but what are what are we offering unto the Lord that's the old Lord you know I'm doing this for you I'm doing that for you but what do you say what is that God wants us to do amen what does God want you to do ain't may hole please in the name of the Lord I have his leadership in your heart have his leadership in your soul a man so that what you are doing in everyday living is what God wants you to do and how you do it when you do it where you do it it's what God wants a mayor's know what I didn't make the decision God made this decision a man to God be the glory a man all brothers show that you can you can truly say it's not me that lives this Christ to live within me amen and if that is the truth amen if that's us say the Lord then no matter what happens in your life God's in control amen no matter what you do God told you to do it amen if not yes not a choice you made it's not a decision made you made no no it's it's another anointing it's another life it's another influence in your life and it's in your soul a man when it comes to us this in our flesh when it comes to us making a decision we're going to do this we're going to do that and oh yeah it's all in our minds Billy and the senses of our flesh and so on and or maybe even the senses of your human spirit but if you're born again it's not me it's got in me amen amen amen and again they're part of God and I lighting this in the message I have heard but now I see if what you're doing is that God doing it or is it you doing it or is what you're doing is it is it just based on the letter of the word or is it the spiritual revelation of the word and it's God in control ain't man Oh what did you do this why did you do that that's what that don't make sense that don't make sense well I believe it with God because I'll tell you this when it comes to intellectually and when it comes to naturally what God does doesn't make sense for the truth into our human thoughts hey there's absolutely the truth because old by listen Satan is working on the senses of our flesh all you got to do this because you need this you got to do that because you need that you got to go here because you or you're gonna play what you physically need right there no but what does God want me to do where does God want me to go and it doesn't make sense to me to our natural innate human nature no no it doesn't makes it Lord will I need this we've got to be well you go do this and I'll bless you with that amen but if people think you and sing well for me to me to get this result I got to do it this way I got to do it this time I got to do it in this place no no no no no brother sister we got to do it and let God decide any man I tell you this when God makes a decision we think oh Lord I won't i won't be able to accomplish this I'm gonna do it oh yes you will I'll be there amen I'm gonna do it now you hadn't got to do it so God doesn't it in every in such a way so that we'll know that it's not us it's not it's not the devil either working in our flesh is God working in our soul because our lives will be America amen what you do how you do it when you do it where you do it is it's a miracle and people who have people would be astonished it says well how do you know this now can you do this well it's not me it's Christ in me you know and again it's like I told you about that when I was working in the retail business and and we were going to have a sale and they were looking for a certain thing that they they they were supposed to put on us as a special you know they do draw customers into the store and so on and they were looking for this looking for that a nice and some papers or something and then I was looking to but not in the way that they were looking a man because they were they were running the air running there and looking here and looking there and the finally as I said well one of the manual said mister lush are you concerned I said yes I am and they said well why aren't you looking for this I said I am and I said I'm not worried about it because I said I said wherever it is I said the lord ëletís to it and I told that to them although they they they were not some of them were not professing Christians and so on but they knew that I was a Christian they knew that I was standing with the Lord they knew that I was being led by the spirit and it's not my real father going be done and they so what are you gonna do I said well I'm just waiting on the Lord I said and he's gonna he's gonna give it to us I said before the store opens amen because we were going around looking for it and the Lord did praise the name of the Lord and we went and then here it was right there I right there Oh how'd you know that I said well I said that was in God's hands I told you he was going to he was going to find it for us I said it's not me we do this and we do this we do that but I should trust the Lord amen by the grace of Almighty God scene showing God in control not us oh my if it's arson control as human beings they're my co-workers and it was their human part that was in control because they were worried they were all mine they were all tore up because nervous but they couldn't understand why I was so calm and so on I said well I said I find it I said the Lord knows where it is and yeah you were like that I said yeah I was like that and then they couldn't understand why I was so calm and why I wasn't so worked up and what I wasn't doing like the restaurant running here running there looking here lifting this lifting that well I started just following these leadership and he'll leave me to it ain't man and that's right you got to wait on the Lord and as I said we did find it before the store open a man and I found it and then and to God be the glory amen so brother sister iske we've got it we gotta let God be in control of your I don't care what the job you're doing whether it's the sisters in the home whether sir brothers in their jobs but you got to be led by the spirit it's not what you want to do what does God want you to do a man and again there's like III one there's the Lord why do you let me here why did you lead me there why did you go walkin want me to get do this job you want me to do that job and or there's so many different jobs that I had but I believe it was the Lord wanted one of me to experience this he wanted me to experience that God was teaching me a man and God is teaching us God is raising us God has incurred while showing courage as a man so we're gonna follow his leaders by the grace of God or don't you try to figure that with your mind in your census you gotta be led by the spirit sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God and the sons and daughters of God are walking in the spirit a man your walk in the spirit if you're walking in spirit you're gonna be led by the spirit but if you're not walking in the spirit you won't be led by the spirit ain't man because you're gonna go you're going to go by the intellect not the not the leadership in your soul a man again when they say the Prophet said if you are born again God is in your soul and if you're not born again he said God is not in your soul and if God is not in your soul you're not morning no no you might be religious but not born again a man so see the importance of being born again not nothing recognizing over there that's god that's God that's his word that's his word yeah but it's got to be in you a man brother I got the revelation in my heart not in my head because the devil got it in his head and he a maybe more than that when it comes to Satan a man that's why that's whether you can have 99% of the truth amen and 1% wrong a man because you don't have it in your soul you got it in your head you got the end of the intellect of it the intellectual part of it but you don't have the spiritual revelation and we got the spiritual revelation in our hearts it's going it's going to manifest in us what God wants to be in our lives it's gonna give us God's leadership when God wants to save this our God wants us to do this and so on amen now I tell you most believers today they got it in their heads but they don't have it in their hearts hey man oh yeah oh they might grow too and they live this this kind of like they won't do this or on the Christian so I won't do that I'm a Christian I won't do that and well you you don't have to say I won't do it you're not going to do it amen because why because you're born again you got a new nature and you're governed by that new nature amen but there's too many I know there's a lot of believers that are still going by their own old nature Oh like like I said this person is a good person and that person is a good they got good ideas and good days good that they need the goodness of God any man in their souls brother there ever anything we need is the goodness of God amen so it's the job you're doing God's leadership in your heart now and knowing that I want to come to education is the education you're getting God's leadership in your heart did God want you to have that education not sometimes not necessarily it's the influence of the world amen or the sake quenette education oh yeah see that's that's a cos the devil he works on the intellect but God working on the spiritual revelation hey man well God wants you to have this one sad but God don't want you to go there and get this all our chicken because more education man gets to less trust and faith he got and God he's gone by his gun way his knowledge he's gone by what he's been trained he's going by what he's been taught amen brother sister as I said I wouldn't got a grade 9 diploma and then there was a where I was maybe in my forties when I went and took that equivalence equivalency test to see if I could get a grade 11 diploma and I took the equivalency test and I got 72% and they gave me a crate a grade 11 equivalency diploma although I never got it in grade 10 I never got in grade 11 a man and so on but the Lord taught the item must have led me to that time a man most was think I got to do is I got it I got it no follow the COTS leadership a man do what God wants you to do and when he wants you to do it how he want you to do it get the education that God wants it again no no don't go by the influence of a man out there or the influence of the teachers from the influence of the professor's and all that no that's what God wants you to have like the problem of God he had grade seven others never a grade seven others might have a grade five or six or four amen right and brothers I know there was a preacher there God use tremendously you were greedy yet great for yeah yeah greedy for that's all yeah and as I said I went and I I and I got a grade nine diploma and that was it I went on grade 10 then again I never got no diploma I'm not great never got naughty blown they may Lord all praise the Lord I was I was following these leadership Lord whatever you want me to do whatever glory whatever you want me to have a man so Lord I'm not gonna boast too much in my knowledge I said I get this diploma or that diploma I'll leave that with God amen so I followed God's leadership doing what he wanted me to do when he wanted me to do it and where he wanted me to do a man again as I say when we came to the message of the hour and in gamble they were saying old brother Gerald we want you to be the pastor I said no no no I said brother baron say you can take it or another brother that was there I said brother you could a no no no we are not the pastor we do not have the calling you take it but I didn't want it and the father I go I thank the Lord I said have caught the brother God said if you want it he said God never called you a man and I didn't want it that's the absolute truth I didn't want it and even though I I just filled it in there I said all fillion and so on and I knew it was God that was working in me because worried there was a ministry God was working on a man so it wasn't me working on that ministry was God working on that ministry it was God that led me to do them so the Scarlet led me to do that ain't man here I was in gamble here it was in Buer and here I was maybe I was out in western Newfoundland and countering the people there counselling the people in western new for a counseling the people of southern new flag counseling Iowa's yes I said Lord I said I don't know what's going on here but I'll leave that with you and counseling them in central Newfoundland and so on so I said Lord I said whatever you want to do in me through me that's up to you I'll do it hey man I'll follow your leadership amen i him sit down and try to figured out what would be the best you know and will I get more money out of this well I gave him what I high I was I was basically a pastor but I wasn't receiving no tides no no because everyone that I was ministering to was penny paste paid paying their ties to somebody else you know and and again like I said somebody went and said to another sister who's your pastor and they said well [Music] I pay my Tyson brother journal but I feel that he's the pastor I consult no they said I pay my ties to this brother but he says the brother journal is my pastor but they weren't paying ties to me they said what yeah he says I got questions I'll ask whether Journal if I'm wondering about this I'm looking for sir looking for leadership I'll ask with a journal and see what the Lord only give me through him but I'm paying my twice for this man over there and then and the sister said oh she said that's what I'm doing she says you're right is our pastor she because she said I I do the same thing I take his counsel I'm seeking his advice and his leadership amen and only that they got to the place where they got to the place where the man that they were paying their tie suit he would call me on the phone oh I I wondered about this I wondered about that he was seeking me for leadership yeah but still I wasn't looking for tithes and offerings I was looking for the will of God I was giving the glory to God hey man it's the same with the prophet of God he wasn't looking for his tithes and offerings he was giving it away of course the government stepped in there and he had to do this he had to do that make changes and so on yeah but what did he do he said he didn't he didn't want to do and do anything he wanted to take he said the 10% he said no he tell you took 90% and give it to the Lord and he would just live on the 10% yeah uh-huh but yet there are those that are so fussy and so particular about their 10% and they'll get it right down to a dime get it right down to this right down to that I said before I said for goodness sake I said don't be that fussy about it I say you give the I said the more you give the Lord and more you'll give you back a man so I said don't you do that but I've seen a lot of believer be real fussy over their tidings and they they want to make it oh yeah there's mother around one time was dealing with the same thing and they would do his brothers a I would say that over the years how would they pay their tithes they wouldn't write a check they pay their Tyson in dimes they have dimes what because that's 10% of a dollar and whatever how many dollars dude that's how many times they were put there yeah and they were put that into any to the end of the box the dimes oh yeah amazing brother and they were so fussy and so particular that's exactly my tidings well give God more and you get more back amen well yeah I mean I've experienced a lot of those things over the years a man but to me I want to come to tithing or did you give it to the Lord amen hey man here take that Lord oh well I don't require this I don't require that no once that's fine a man - brother what is our attitude my comforter your tithing and your offerings Amen let's give to God God preeminence Lord uh-huh I'll give you 90 percent now I'll just take ten deliver God's God help us brother amen again it's a right motivator Jacob for that having the anointing of the Holy Ghost in your heart and you're gonna have that attitude you're gonna have that spirit by the grace of Almighty God amen brother and the people are going to recognize you as being different oh yeah and not just religious they're gonna wreck it all your because they know religious people but they're gonna know that you're spiritual by the grace of God so are you really delicious today are you spiritual there's a religion to brought you here or is it the Holy Ghost amen brothers in religion and control your life and you're doing what you what you're doing and living the way you live because of the Holy Ghost in you or is it your natural desires and feelings god help us this believing God oh I believe God yeah but you got to show it in your life in the message works with faith experience he said Paul justified Abraham by what he saw by what God saw in Abraham not by what man sees what God sees and he said by James he justified Abraham by what man saw in Abraham so what does God see in you and what is man saying a man and he said Abraham see he said he believed God and that's what God saw him is was his faith he believed God amen and he sober then when he went to acting and so it was already done that's what man saw in him a man why he went and lived his faith and he went out acting it living that out doing this up why are you why are you doing this job whether the Lord gave it to me so I'll do it it's not what I chose is God chosen how many can say that with the work you're doing the job you're doing he's quite God chose some people choose it you know well that's good because I can get more money brother one of these days it's sister if that's the reason we're gonna be left here with our money that's the absolute truth yeah no no you're leaving all that to God by the grace of God amen Abraham didn't do it because of this and because of that he just did it for the glory of God see your right motive and your right objective is for the glory of God regardless of what it is a man is not because I do this job because I'll get more pain no no maybe God wants you to get less pain oh yeah right God want me to get less pain yes yeah or God wants you to do this job well you'll get more pay but I don't want to do that job see what's your choice we want this and God wants it oh well lord maybe I'll get more money if I do this well Lord son ah I'll give you this job Oh Lord I don't want to do that but son you'll get more money no I don't want to do that job yeah so it's man doing what they want to do how many are doing what God wants you to do how many and are in the will of God yeah and sometimes God would let's just get out of his will to test us oh yeah he will you get out as really doing testing you a man to bring out this in you to bring her that in you see what your motive is gonna be so what your attitude is gonna be see what your action and reaction is going to be a man to see if you're going to bring up the action of a real believer hey man hey oh yeah God does those things brother he did it in job probably brings that out he said what was God doing he said God was testing job Oh his wife to curse God and die commit suicide amen he said no he said we trust the Lord he said the Lord the Lord does good the Lord is eternal our loves good lord I was evil and so he says offer a reason not my real father died and be done he committed himself to the Lord and he wanted to know he wanted no white God a lot of this that's why you know when it is it so called comforters were there and trying to encourage your landing and they were condemning him oh job disc job this job this job said listen he said I want to talk to God not man I want to talk to God a man so God at it and his and it is one there to talk to him but he waited to the other three were finished then he came he said Joel he said you put yourself first but God last so he said Joel you got to get preimage to the Lord so he brought job into into contact with God a man and God challenged job's faith hey man it cause doing anything in our lives he's challenging our faith and he said Joel where were you when I laid the foundations of there when the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy amen where were you see he was testing is they job had a lot of emphasis on the natural things of life but God was God was testing Joel to bring out the spiritual brother there's too many put the emphasis on the natural things but how many are giving God preeminence in the spirit a man grace of God brother he said abraham believed God that's what God saw in Abraham and he said when he went to acting as though it was already done that's what man saw him do we believe in the resurrection and the rapture do we believe in the end that we're in the end does our life reflect that the emphasis we're putting on this the emphasis were putting on that if there's anything we ought to be putting the emphasis on is to spiritual not the natural but no it's a generation that they want to want to put the insan the natural make sure everything is in order and the lantern natural make sure everything is going to be there for them in the natural but why would you spiritual because the natural is passing away but their faith is in the natural not in the spiritual any brown faith within the spiritual god help us so brother i trust by the grace of god we're here because of faith it's not our natural being what our natural beings want its what our what's in our souls trusting by grace so that's why our brother Joshua and brother Rochelle and brother John is here Wow amazing why are they here the grace of God yeah it's gotta be it's gotta be a spiritual satisfying a spiritual hunger and a spiritual thirst in their souls amen by the grace of God so what we do is to satisfy that spiritual hunger and thirst that God has put in us amen brother God had put a - spiritual hunger thirst and job and he was hungry and thirsty oh no when I come from not the natural hey when God did this and God did that and he said the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen and so on each it was leaving it to God he said the Lord gives Lord in his way so I said we'll leave that with the Lord I don't understand that he said I don't know what's going on but I'll leave with God O God and give us that pain a man no matter what's going on your life no matter what's going on in your job in this situation let's just wish lord help me to just keep trust in you amen and he said that's the same he said as it is to us because our works Express what faith we have but if we're afraid to act on on what God said what we believe then we do not believe it he said you've got to believe it and if you really believe it in your heart you're going to act it out your life is going to reflect it a man and and the world's going to see it Abraham's works was expressing his faith he had in God's promise God elfis a man to believe the promise God have us to believe the word and we'll gloatin that God had control amen amen no matter what God wants me to do I'm gonna do it where he wants me to go I'll go oh yeah oh yes grace brother definitely the grace of God amen and again in the book of Job chapter 4 and verse 5 get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of the of my mouth forsake or not and she shall preserve the lover and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding many know the word and know the message but they don't have the understanding that they need amen that will bring them again into fellowship with God and put God in control of their lives so it's not me that lives this Christ that liveth in me this is tremendous so we whether this service today and whatever you do is it gonna be Christ in you oh it's Jesus he's going to do this and he's going to do that so on yeah but he's gonna be in your flesh yeah the word is made flesh in the right just think just think when you gloat I'll praise the name of the Lord brothers sister be on our guard so we're not going to reflect the devil no we wanna reflect Jesus oh yeah just it make sure make your calling and your election sure to make sure by the grace of God that in your actions and in your reactions it's Jesus it's Jesus living in you amen we consider Jesus living in the first two thousand years ago then it was Jesus in the disciples Jesus in in in in in his bride run all the way down through now it's Jesus in this end time right a brother's sister come on please what you did yesterday was it Jesus in your doing it Jesus ain't control what you said the conversation you had those that you were dealing with was that Jesus amen or was it or was it you for for most of the people it's just them and really is it's a false anointing amen Oh while I do this and I do that and I'll do that you know so on no no gotta be gotta be him Amen you by the grace of God whether it's whether you go here you go there even if God even do it listen the most simple thing that he might need you to do during your day he's got to be in control as I told you about sister burns and knows that she dealt with the devil for two hours they things in the house began to get darker and darker and darker and darker yeah and the devil took advantage of it and Satan started to talk to her and he started to make negative comments to her oh she was there she there wasn't an elderly couple upstairs that she was just look after and at the time they might have been in their 80s late 80s and so on and one of them was in bed bedridden and so on well she had a hard time she did and the devil guy got to talking with her when she was washing clothes I can see it in that I was that's on and to finally but hallelujah it's like he was talking to brother Branham when sister Hope died and and and the baby was dying yeah and all the dark cloud come down and the devil again sold you used you believe God God did this God did that and so on oh yeah but brother brown said the devil begin to reason and reason and reason oh yeah and he began detonate negative negative need until finally he said he struck that eternal life and when he struck that eternal life he said that he said the anointing came on the brother branham and when he was there looking at his child his baby dying and he says get thee behind me Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they said it wasn't dark no more he said everything got bright Amen even though his wife was gone she had just gone and now his child was going yeah but everything got bright there was the presence of the Lord a man but Satan was focusing on those negative and the natural things but he was God brought him to focus on the spiritual hey man brothers like sister when when sister hope was dying praise the Lord you know in the end brother Brown was there talking to her because he didn't want her to go so on and finally oh she said oh oh she said analogies watch what she said too but she's all honey or our bill she said I've got to go if she said the angels are there waiting for me hi Oh phrase the Lord who was in control it certainly wasn't sister hole it wasn't brother branham no it was the Lord hallelujah it was spiritual and it was negative it wasn't dark you know we make men we make those situations dark no no it was bright and it was light and she said all the angels are waiting for me she said the Bell she said I gotta go she said she said goodbye she said and we'll see you again and she did tell him what what he felt he felt he should do a man and then she let go and he let her go and she was gone hey man just think her body was still there but she was gone that's why I keep telling them I said don't you think I don't do believe that during that grape I said no no no that's just dust hey man I said there with the Lord there in another dimension by the grace of God brother god help us to believe it amen do we truly have that faith that's making us more and more conscious of that dimension or are we are we living in this dimension this this dimension just just a physical sense of this body brings us more and more contact with that dimension we're conscious of this one we're looking at this we're feeling this and we're thinking this and thinking that and that's got more control of the people and the Holy Ghost worse if the Holy Ghost amen you're not living and conscious all over get away I'm not gonna dwell on that nothing to dwell on that oh thank you lord hallelujah thank you Jesus amen focus on the spiritual not the natural it's like when brother Badham himself amen he stepped he stepped beyond the curtain of time as a word and oh it was it was a hope here was his daughter yeah she just died but if she said and he said who are you she's you don't know me what was her name oh yeah Sharon Rose yeah and she said you don't know me mmm no she's I'm Sharon Rose it but she just died she was only just a baby but when he got in that dimension she was a young girl she's a young girl Sharon Rose yes she said don't you believe this she's you preach this and she said oh she said her mom's just over there and she went over and sister Bannon was sitting in the chair yeah and he saw her he recognized her but she said bill she said they want to take this chair she said is paid for because just before she died apparently before all these things happen that that the were they had bought the chair and they weren't able to pay for it and they come and took it they took the chair back she said they won't take this one they said he's paid for her praise the Lord what a place we're going you know what's real I I trust by grace through the faith that God has given us and God is giving us a man through the message of the hour and the prophet of this age all that God has done brother we ought to be more and more and more conscious than any other age to that other dimension yeah if the data are waiting on us well that we got to be conscious of it yeah they're waiting for us to getting that thing we're conscious of that dimension conscious of the resurrection amen and God's waiting on us for the rapture so we got a bit like Jesus we got to get in the flesh a man not like the disciples they were sleeping a man like Jesus we get it your Jesus was in the flesh for what was he he was the Word of God made flesh now we're the Word made flesh and if we're the Word made flesh we're gonna wreck it he recognized what he had to do what was going to happen now I must add the bride to recognize what we're going to do he was going to lay his life down pick it up again but the bride is gonna pick her life huh as God revealed to us what is in this hour and this age brother got the responsibility in the bright bridegroom was one thing the responsibility and the bride is another responsibility in the bride is the resurrection and the rapture now eternity mostly just conscious of doctrines and I think brother George brought up the emphasis that people are putting on doctrines brother it's the book of Acts amen and in the book of Acts is any revelation is the resurrection and the rapture oh yeah the book of it I like I like what he brought out the book of Acts is still got ongoing amen as I said right you're going from the the Jews of the Gentiles now you're going from the Gentiles back to the Jews or what we're seeing oughta make is very very serious amen more and more God conscious more and more conscious of eternity more and more conscious of the resurrection more and more conscious of the rapture Jesus said I am the resurrection and the rapture would have rights your resurrection because of cause crisis in the bride now we are the resurrection and the rapture I pray God that we're going to have the it's going to have the results in us the effect on us that it had in Jesus when he was here and he went and he prayed and prayed and he prayed and he knew it is going to lay his life in order to manifest it he would have delay it suffer have you considered what he suffered he suffered for you for me what was where we were thee of that why did he do that what did he endure all that suffering that pain that agony and he in experienced death why because he had a revelation of his sons and daughters that he was going to redeem a man god help his brother he redeemed sons and daughters and he was laying his life down for his sons and all the things today that people will do for their natural families brother look what he did look what he did let's let's recognize it as I said there's too many of those pictures of a Christ on the cross - not exactly the way there should be why because it was nothing but blood a man you blood all over his body blood from the head right on down to the feet under finally they'd the drove the spear into his side and all the blood came out and the prophet of God said where did it go he said I went down to the earth and he said just dried up yeah but the life of the blood is what counts a man now I said the light he came back with the life of the blood and he shared it with you and me as the Holy Ghost amen praise the name of the Lord God help us to have a right motive and a right objective for what we believe and that's what the Prophet is highlighted in this message I have heard but now I see he said what is your motive and what is your objective for believing this message what is your mode of an objective for believing this and believe in this I brought it out in one of these in this message before in hearing and seen what brother Brown said concerning healing he says you can have faith to be healed what is your motive what is your objective why do you want to be healed most want to be healed because oh I just don't wanna be sick no more but he said that's the wrong motive and the wrong objective what is the right motive and the right objective for your healing it is for the glory of God you've gotta want it for the glory not because I'm sick and I don't want to sit no more no I want Lord I want you to glory for yourself in me I'll give you the glory I'll give you the praise Oh are you Lord Lord there's not me just go oh yes Oh Lord wonderful I got faith to be healed I got faith to be healed north to the west well that's what I'm thank thank you lord Vaughn and then they'll gluten and rejoice oh yeah I'm here because I have faith to be you know the prophecies you're gonna have faith to be healed to go to hell if your motive is not right your objective is not right got it and your motive and objective has got to be for the glory of God but the proud of God is highlighting here in this message there's too many their motive is not right and your objective is not right he said they have selfish reasons a man they want to be heal for this reason and they want God to bless them for this reason or that reason no no it's gotta be for the glory of God and brother in the message he said he said job he said let's take a little of his life job was a prophet and he was a man that lived back before the Bible was written and has been thought that job was one of the oldest books of the Bible because it was written before Genesis was written and he said jovi said this great warrior and prophet and no doubt he had been brought up and he had served the Lord all of his life and he said he has such a gallant life to the people and he said all IDI respects for him but he said he come to a place where he calls a near being tempted of the Lord attested of the Lord he said but I'd like to use the word tested and he said every son that cometh to God must first be tested tried and child trained and then if the testing gets hard and we think it's too hard and and won't listen and won't take heed he said then he said we become illegitimate children and not a child of God because there's nothing can move a real born-again child of God away from his parent he is part of God amen as if you're really truly born again amen and that and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's in your heart he's in your soul he's in control not just in your flesh oh yeah I've seen a lot of people with the anointing in their flesh but how many got the anointing in their heart yeah God Elvis he says you can do more no more deny it you can deny yourself were you had an experience and you've been trained and tested and now he said this man he said being a prophet he had access he said the God's grace but Jobe didn't have a Bible to read and it says but he had access to God by revelation and by vision we got the Bible but for Joel was absolutely faith revelation and vision amen and it was in his heart not his head a man and he said Satan began to accuse job and that's the way he does every inspired sermon of God Satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right now should we find out his life and trials his great faith even Jesus when he came on earth he referred to the patience of Job and he said have you not read of the patience of Job heesu faith waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled amen we don't doubt God we believe God amen and we have patience with God a man and he said he had a lovely family they were taken from him he had good health it was taken from him everything he hold in his life was take and he had us a sheep with a piece of crock scraping his boils and even to his own wave spoke against him why not curse God and die and he said thou speakest as a foolish woman God took brother-sister what if God took all what you got and remembers coming to that test oh yeah when the Antichrist reigns he's gonna come to that test where you're gonna lose everything you got you won't hold your car you won't own your your vehicle you won't own any no money no no that's coming God's gonna really test us that's right that's why I like I said I sometimes like when I go to a bank and get cash I said can I have some of that worthless money and they just laughing it worthless I said yeah it's worthless as it's just paper that's all because it's not when you consider it was all based on gold when you consider the gold that nations God it's not working because they want they want to have gold because that that'll that will justify them in putting up more and more cash it's supposed to be based on the gold that the country got but I tell you America don't have enough country to back up the the funds that they got out Canada don't have enough gold the back of the funds that they would that they got on paper no no that's why our brother George I think must have touched on it when he was here concerning the Antichrist and the Antichrist got more gold than any other nation that's why that one day they're going to have to give everything over to the control of the Antichrist amen beyond your dirt so that you're not going to give your control to the Antichrist for the sake of money no we're gonna give our chiral control to Christ amen for the sake of our faith for the sake of the resurrection for the sake of the rapture this is up serious cities brother what this is what I want that want you to get what is your motive and your objective for believing this message and the prophet of God highlights your motive and your objective why are you believing this message what what is your objective oh well it's going to give me wrapping paper going to rapture or and it comes to the message God did this God did this yes well what are we doing the Prophet did this to poverty what are we doing the responsibilities in your lap now the prophet of God was seen seeing those things about run and the people weren't living it out and that's why he he was he consulted the Lord because so the Lord he was really burdened now he was so he was so desperate and and and felt so bad that there were so few believers that I'll be honest he wanted to commit suicide that's how bad it was for him because why he was looking for more and more results in what he did and what God did in his ministry and he was getting less and less and less results yeah he said now he said there's no anointing there's not nothing like it used to be in his services one time it's just a just a dead dog he said and it's and it's like that now I did thump and he felt that way until the angel pulled him aside and the Angels her brother branham he said leave it in their lap he said just like he said when the brother he said went to look for our wife rising and he said well he said to Abraham we said what if he said she don't come she didn't want to come he said you are free he said from the responsibility you see just leave it in their lap and that's all the ministry can do is leave it in their lap it's a tremendous burden people don't understand the burden of the ministry they think it's just getting up and preaching this doctrine this idea this thought this thought oh no it's a responsibility a tremendous responsibility now and again if you ever need to pray for anyone pray for the ministry yeah the grace of God - just to sustain them and keep them grace of God because it's going to get worse and worse and worse and there's gonna get fewer and fewer and fewer that are bound for the resurrection and bound for the rapture they got the knowledge of the word they got the knowledge of the message they got the the intellectual knowledge of this doctrine and that doctrine but they don't have the right motive and a right objective for the message of the hour they leave in the man why are you believing this why are you staying there we're in the Word of God for this hour why am I in it what is the right motive objective the resurrection and the rapture it's not just being right in my doctrine no no it's having the faith that pleases God in this hour a man for the resurrection and the rapture resurrection the referring faith just consider the faith that Jesus said when he came to the end of his ministry now consider the faith that the bride got at the end of the ministry what what is God looking for God looking for the resurrection and the rapture ganda someone says I believe this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine again as our brother George highlighted the fact that people put emphasis on doctrine dr. doctrine they preach doctrine to preach doctrine yeah no no this preached the word in flesh the reserve to make drop or to manifest the resurrection and the rapture listen so I want you to notice he says sing and come up before God because he could come before God and accused the Christians or the believers all the time and notice he said the confidence that God had in a believer in other words God said to Satan you can't do it he's a just man he's justified he's a good man and there's not one like him in the holder oh what a man he said that God Himself would say to his enemy my servant is so perfect he said there's not another man like him at all on the earth oh if we could only be that kind of a man that God would could bestow that confidence upon us that no that will not twist from his word or beam away anyway stay exactly and he can put his trust in us can God trust you with the revelation that he has given you amen God will discern our our motives and our objectives why are you believing this message what is God's purpose for us to believe this message we have to have the right motive and the right objective he said job held right on and there was no turning back and he you cease when a man or a person has once really come in contact with God with that genuine revealed faith that God is there is nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from God but you seek a job with his perfect revelation of God and who God was and how God loved him he waited no matter what the circumstances he waited for his faith to be confirmed because he had a grip on God a revelation and brother he did have faith because God highlighted it in the presence of the devil and you considered my servant job God knew what was going to happen yeah the devil says yeah but that's you you're protecting him you're doing this you're doing that God said well you can go down but he said you can test them you can try try this try that but he said don't take his life and God allowed the devil to do that with you and me but do this do this do this but don't take his life amen how many would love that and I acknowledge that going on in our lives amen are we gonna be like Joel the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord as we said when God took all of his wealth God took all of his family God took all of his possessions the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord he worshiped God he gave God the glory how many are willing to do that most feel oh that's the devil yeah but God permitted the devil to do it you permitted Satan to do this for him Satan to do that brother in the name of Jesus helped us to Lord you trust God to know that you're in control not the devil Lord if this happened in your life that happen in your life you got a CO say Lord that was Satan I know but why did you allow it there's a purpose and there's a reason God hasn't turned us over to the devil with that reason God's not gonna let the devil do this and do this and do this and and just just first a we can play with you no no God got a reason God permitted him to do this with job that would joke and and there's not one of us but we're tested in one one one way or another like Joe was yeah and God and and it's fresh for a reason history he wanted to bring out the faith that was in Joe for you or your sake and for mine oh yeah they bring that the faith that was in Joel for generations to come oh yeah to bring out the revelation of the resurrection to bring out the concerning the rapture cabrillo concerning the nation and we were with him before the foundation of the world yeah where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth when the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy amen Joe don't know where he was he was back there amen Oh wonderful god help us brother jobs motive was right and his objective was right it was all for the glory of God he endured it all to God be the glory he wasn't going to he didn't blame the devil even no no he knew that God was in control but there's too many today blaming the devil for this anything negative happens the devil the devil the devil yeah but why did God allow it there's a reason brother God wants to bring out our motive and our objective God wants to bring out in your life the motive you have for believing the word for professing to believe the message the motor you have for professing to be a Christian your objective what is your objective the problem of God said there's something that no matter what the difficulty is you want to go any out because you've got an objective and he said if you take the right motive towards that objective you'll get there he said you have got to have the right motive towards your objective God looking at your mode of your objective for believing the message you consecrate your motive objective for being in this church this morning and God's going to allow this to happen that to happen to bring out test you and bring out your your motive and objective that's the truth no matter what happens what God is manifesting is your motive for for living your objective for living for this word for this truth your motive and objective for coming to church your motive objective for taking your stand for the message God wants to bring it out yeah you know you know all that God has done and tested the people he's brought out their motives and their objectives the purpose why why why are you believing it why are you staking your stand why are you separating yourself and so on what is your objective yes sir what's your reason and what is your purpose he said always remember God's words are true I believe the right mental attitude toward any divine promise of God will bring it to pass and he said you can look at it in the right way but he should remember here has been my standard in life I have tried to do this the first thing I want to find out whether it's the will of God or not the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it these are then if it's the will of God and my objective is right and my motive is right I have faith that it'll be done but you gotta have a right motive and a right objective amen because first it's the will of God and my objective is to glorify Him and my motive is to give him all the glory see there's no selfish motive about it and he said if you have a selfish motive it won't work if you got selfish motive you won't get resurrection and rap free faith no no if your motive is selfish and not for the glory of God it's got to be for the glory of God a man an decent of your objective is to make money for yourself or something he said you'll never succeed and then try to do something outside of the will of the Lord it won't work to begin with he said the first thing he said your achievement is only by motive and objective he says your motive has got to be right and your objective has got to be right in the eyes of God not selfish it's got to be for the glory of God and if you're a motive if your objective is right and your motive is wrong he said it won't happen amen you have got to have the right objective you've got to have the right motive and then take it up on the leading of the Holy Spirit in your heart and stay with it and God will bring it to pass but you got to have a right motive a right objective a right reason and purpose for believing what you're believing a right reason in the eyes of God being here in this word men this message in this church but there's too many their motives and objectives are too selfish and not for the glory of God you're just thinking about themselves but not the Lord Joe kept his mind on the Lord to Joe who was all for the glory of God no matter what happened to God be the glory amen he did not accuse God he didn't put God down no matter how hard it became for him no he's still reverenced and respected God hey man no matter what you go through your reverence and respect God a man you'll give God the glory why because you've experienced the love of God you have met God and you've experienced his love and His mercy and His grace amen to God be the glory you've got to have the right mode of an objective and God will bring it to pass he said do you remember him do you love him he said Paul said whatever you do we do we do in the spirit in all things we should remember him if there is a decision to be made let's wait remember what kind of decision we think he would make then let that be our decision let him make it and it becomes our decision if we get a ste let's remember he never was in a hurry if we get over anxious remember equals in eternity time means nothing to him it's the motive and the objective of our heart he said let's remember him hallelujah that's the important thing is to mode an objective for the glory of God and brother you'll recognize that and he'll respect it hallelujah he said we don't use the gift of God for commercial no no he could tell me where it was that but I don't have any need of it I would never faith enough to ask him for this or for that if I never need of it I believe if I'd ask him he'd tell me but first you see your motives and objectives has to be right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith on the stairs our real objective to be in the will of God and if you want to be well what do you want to be well for and if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed he said you've got to have a motive and objective and he said they have to be right according to the will of God and then it's when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in their then it's over but you got to have a right motive and a ret objective P to be healed a man it has got to be for the glory of God if not as the Prophet said you can be healed and go to hell why because the motive is not right and the objective is not right no matter what God does you got to have the right motive and right objective and in this message I'll close it more the Prophet did bringing about healing and why you want to be healed is it just for the sake you want to be healthy or do you want to give God the glory a man and what there's something else that he brings out that God had revealed to the prophet and the Prophet had revealed it to believers and it was concerning oil in Kentucky and he went and he told the believers what God had showed him and that there was oil here here and there and there and there and that they were supposed to go and dig the oil wells but they didn't respond they didn't respond I understand you got to do it in God's time and you got to do it with the right attitude and you got to have a right motive and a right objective but those believers and he named their one brother that he had told and he said he didn't go for a long time where the prophet of God said he said there's oil there does oil there and is all there and what he meant that should go and dig the oil wells but they waited too long but then there came a need and they they felt they needed this and they needed that so those brothers got together and oh brother Brown said there's oil there and oil there so they got together and they started to purchase land purchased this land and this land and they started to make agreements with one another we want you to agree with us to do this agree with us to do that and so on and and oh yeah this is this and you'll be blessed with this and you'll be blessed with that yeah but he said to the brother he said brother he said you ought to a went a long time ago because when they went finally went it wasn't there somebody else had gotten into it yeah and they got it and they were blessed by it but they weren't believers but their motive was right and their objective was right and their attitude was right it wasn't selfish no but the believers when they got into it and said oh we need this and we need that so we should do this and should do that and the power of God said you ought to have went a long time ago but they didn't do it and the brother said to brother branham he said I made a great mistake by not doing that brother branham and he said and brother Branham said brother he said if you had went down there you would haven't all the oil he said but he said they wouldn't listen to it so he said went to searching for it and said go down and tell us where the oil is now and brother Brown said no no he said we don't use the gift of God for commercial what is your motive and objective for wanting God's blessings in your life it's got to be for the glory of God amen not because oh Lord I want you to make me rich and I want you to make me this and I want you to make me that build me up Lord no no escabi for the glory of God amen what God was doing in jobs life was for the glory of God a man oh yes job went down God went up in jobs life in jobs life a man so he said don't use the gift of God for commercial no no he said he could tell me where it was but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him if I had a need of it I believe I'd ask him he'd tell me and he said but first you see your motives and your objectives as to be right why we want it just just to be rich oh just to have this just to have that Amen oh thank you Lord got no worries now you know but God loves those things to come test your faith amen and brother he told those brothers where it was so that way it would meet their needs and they would bless them but that when they finally decided what they wanted to do they wanted to turn it into a commercial thing not just a personal thing and God was going to bless them and through them God would bless others and so on no they wouldn't do it they waited too long until finally people of the world discovered the oil and they went and they started to dig the wells and then the oil that was down there became less a lot less the power God said that's your fault he said you didn't do when I told you to do it and they knew it their motive was wrong and their objective was wrong when they decided to do it a man he said I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him he said you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith honestly there's a real objective to be in the will of God and if you want to be well what do you want to be well for you want to be healed what's the reason and he said what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get ield what are you gonna do with those blessings when God blesses you be selfish or it's gonna be there to help others and to bless others most people have selfish motives and selfish objectives that's the truth now I know that somebody said do you know that there's men there's preachers around this message that are millionaires why because they take all the tithing they take it off oh yeah I know there's certain places where they have a certain box for the tides and the only one with a key to that box is the pastor he takes all the tithing yeah it's wrong motive wrong objective brother Brown just took what he needed into the tithe and he give he give the rest to the other ministers to the missions oh yeah that's what he did yeah god help us brother we need a right motive and a right objective if we got the right motor but objective we're hearing it the way God wants us to hear and see it the way God wants us to see amen he says you got have a motive and objective and they had to be right according to the will of God and thence when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over and he said to make that word true when the Brethren got down there one fellow went over and brought a bunch of stuff sold leases cheated the other one this way and he said now you just don't make the prophecy Shore within a hundred yards of where these men were digging there well some man struck the big gusher and they lost it those that the Prophet Oh lost it the other man got it why because they didn't the others didn't do it when God told him to do it and their motive was right when they decided to do it their motive was wrong and your objective was wrong and he said just don't make the prophecy sure he said within a hundred yards of where these men were digging there well some man struck the big gusher the rest of them nearly all dried up everywhere through Kentucky but he said because of the selfishness that got among it the objectives was wrong the signing up of a bunch of stuff it would be this way when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God but looked like it was for themselves not the kingdom of God and in one work no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then he said you have faith if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence and we've got to have confidence I want this to the honor and the glory of God then faith a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine faith from God that intellectual faith will get you nowhere it might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing you're looking for and that intellectual faith didn't get them the oil that they went looking for they lost it God took it and gave it to either make believers or unbelievers amazing what is our motive what is our objective their motive their objective was right but the motive of the objective of the believers that the proper told was wrong when they decided it was wrong it was selfish it was for themselves not for the Lord well God's gonna bless me so praise the Lord hallelujah I'm gonna bless others amen God gonna bless me to bless others god bless you to bless others amen but too many gets so selfish is not blessing others is blessing themselves amen brother God give us the right motive and the right objective faith moves in the channel of right motives and right objectives amen grace of God that's the way every believer no matter how bad the cancer you got and how long you been sitting in a wheelchair just if you grasp the revelation from God there then be satisfied knowing that it's going to happen because faith waste waits patiently for the promise and job knew that he was right you hear people today say I told you look at him he said that ain't altogether the truth sometimes it's God testing his people and in this case it was God testing job he said the best man there was on earth at the time God was testing him and he knew job was a prophet that had a vision from God and he had exactly done what God told him to do and God was duty-bound to keep his promise to him all Christians he said has got to be that and when the last struggle of lay comes and death rattles our in our throat we still must steady and remember that God said I'll raise you again in the last day amen and Jobe knew that regardless of what happened to him he knew that God was going to bless him raising in the resurrection amen brother if we got the right motor what objective then by the grace of God we're going to hear it the way God wants us to hear it see it the way God wants to see it we're going to act on it the way God wants us to act on it by the grace of God let's hear it and see it with the right motive and a right objective God is challenging our faith it's important that we hear and see the message the way God wants us to hear it and see it but the Lord has reminded us that we have to have a right motive and a right objective and in the message and I have heard but now I see the Prophet highlights the revelation that to hear and see it according to the will of God we have to have right motives rights of right objectives and what is the right motive right objective is that it has to be for the glory of God amen everything you do and everything you experience you want to glorify God amen pay attention to the written word pay attention to the revealed word and give God the glory don't give the glory to brother Branham you don't give the glory to your pastor the faithful ministry you don't give the glory to yourself you give the glory to God in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths and be not wise in your own eyes but peer the Lord amen the grace of God leave with us amen god bless you with a right motive and god bless you with the right objective amen all for the glory of God that is the right motive right objective it's for God's glory amen brother/sister God Elvis that what you're believing to stand
