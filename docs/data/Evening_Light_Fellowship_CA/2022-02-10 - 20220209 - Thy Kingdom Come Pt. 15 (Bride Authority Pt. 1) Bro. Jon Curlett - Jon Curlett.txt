lord that we would be able to invite you lord into our lives and into our situations lord daily lord with the promise of your word going before us each time lord god lord how fitting it is to lord start the sermon lord on this on this song lord and we just pray that you would anoint lord me to speak lord each one to hear that's here lord and live online lord we pray that you would just speak into lives and hearts and situations lord may you reset us to your word each one lord may you draw us up to it lord may you strengthen us with what's spoken we pray lord just have your way now we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it amen if you can turn in the scriptures to esther chapter 8. esther chapter 8 it's good to be back in the house of the lord once again amen certainly looking forward to sunday where we'll have uh if if not all of us certainly the majority of us here again and then certainly looking forward to that i did want to thank brother bob and the musicians that have stayed true to their commitment and they're staying at their post of duty and it's not easy i know from a preaching standpoint it's not easy to come up here when it's a much smaller crowd and we certainly like to have lots of people in the seats pulling and and doing their part it's always tougher or often it's tougher with a smaller crowd but certainly feel for the musicians because they kind of can feel alone up here i think minister always speaks alone but with the the singing and the plane they can feel a little more isolated so i certainly appreciate that from them amen amen esther chapter 8 verse 1 says on that day did the king of hajwaris give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden scepter toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king and said if it please the king and if i have favor in his sight and the things seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hemadatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king's provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred then the king ashware said unto the esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him have they hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man reverse amen god bless the reading of his word you may have your seats tonight and then we're continuing on with our regular scheduled program on the series of that kingdom come and i want to take a title uh this evening of bride authority amen bride authority and as as always we're going to be continuing to preach to the sisters but i just want to take a couple services here tonight and and no doubt sunday if the lord would will to just speak to the church as a totality to the full bride of christ the men and the women both alike amen so i want to take this this idea of bright authority and we've talked a lot about the position of women about what god says makes a godly woman about where their their beauty is and where their strength is and we've covered the respect and the consideration that these women are due when they're in alignment with the word of god and we've taken a look at what god thinks of those women that do that amen and he puts them in a high position we've talked about the right attitude of a woman and that attitude is of always of submission amendment of respect and we know that that's reflective of our walk as believers amen it is always one of submission to the word of god and it is one of respect to the god that has called us to serve him and to love him amen and we know that if we're in a relationship with god it comes with great benefits and then there's a great benefit package to the bride of christ but she's not there for the benefit package she is there for the benefactory men she is there because she loves him not because of what he has but she certainly enjoys what he has and we want to take a another service maybe as we go into some of those things but i want to review first how we got to this scripture and esther because we see here that the king gives esther great authority that esther is given the opportunity to write whatever she would want written and the king would enforce it but she didn't just get there when she became the queen and if we look in the scriptures we'll see that she did not get the authority of a queen as soon as she became queen but rather there is a period of time there that there's a relationship that's built up between her and the king before he would ever say something like what she gets here and before he ever gives her the authority to use the full power of his kingdom in something that she would require to have done amen and we know that it's no different for the bride of christ that you do not become a believer that you do not just get the holy spirit and then whatever you say and whatever you want god will do and then if we look in the scriptures we always see that there's a progression that there are tiers or levels of authority within the bride of christ within the believer's ranks and we know that god has to take us to a place where we are proven where he trusts us where he can give us full authority and we won't abuse it for our own purposes amen now we know redemptive blessings are always available to us if you are a believer then you have blessings of healing of salvation of deliverance of provision all these different things amen and that has nothing to do with your maturity as a believer that has nothing to do with your relationship except that you are a child you are a son you are a daughter of god if you are saved by the blood of christ you have access to the redemptive blessings that he gave us when he died on the cross for us amen but when we start to talk about authority now we're talking about something different this is not just because you're saved but this is because you've been brother bam speaks in the in the message on adoption but you've come to a place where you do the thing that he would do in that situation even if he hasn't told you what to do remember you have the character of christ where you have the nature of christ and in that proving comes the authority that he wants to give the bride man it's like the military we have men that are generals we have men that are colonels we have men that are captains we have men that are privates at the very bottom don't we and each and every one of them has different levels of authority but nobody steps into the army and becomes a general that day and nobody comes in but they have to prove themselves and how do they prove themselves they proved themselves by what perfect and full obedience to the orders they were given to carry out what they've been told to do and as long as they've been given the tools as long as they've been given the weapons as long as they've been given what they need to get the job done anybody that gets anywhere in the military does it and then they they achieve what the goals and the tasks that they've been given you don't get promoted in the military by being incompetent or disobedient amen and it's no different when it comes to the christians and and the kingdom of heaven you don't get to a place of full authority if you are incompetent or disobedient amen in disobedience means that you're taking things in the way that you want to take them and you're applying them in the way you want to apply them and they're doing things that you want done rather than what god wants you to do amen and we see that as we look through the scriptures as we look at great men and even great women we see that no men were given great responsibility without a time of proving without a time of training in the time of testing you look at moses we look at joshua we look at joseph joseph the closest type of christ in the bible and he put him through jail for how many years and had him unfairly accused and all these different things to test his attitude to see what he would do amen you look at david david anointed king didn't ask for it and then he has to run around for 10 or 15 or 20 years uh trying to save his life from the very one that he respected so much in and wouldn't take the life of in king sully man but what is it god trained them until the point that he could trust them to do the job that he had anointed them to do in the first place amen i was listening to the service that brother joe had sent out to the to the group on whatsapp and he was talking about the these men and and god has to bring them to a place where he knows what they're going to do before they ever do it and not just because he's god but because they've proven it time and time again amen god puts them in a position of great authority where they know what god's purpose and will is and they will do only that with that power and authority that he's given amen it reminds me of when you get married and i can say for myself and i'm sure many of us do when a man marries a woman he adds her name to the bank account doesn't he and she has full access to every cent that he has in that bank account it's a joint account if she wants to go into that bank and empty that account she does but i would guarantee that most of us when we give that card to our wife the first time or we give her the credit card the first time we say this is tied to my accounts you can buy whatever you need with it but we don't tell her she can go buy a car if she needs right we put a limit on what she can buy we say this is for you to buy groceries this is if you're an emergency and you need food or you need clothing or something but everything else i need you to talk to me about and even groceries for a while let's discuss that i have a budget i have a type of a way i need things done so let's talk that over but as she starts to grow and as the relationship starts to grow and as she spends more time with her husband and she knows the way he thinks and she knows the way he likes things and whatnot then soon that starts to relax just bit by bit and bit and pretty soon she can go out and just buy something and she doesn't have to text or call her husband before she buys it why because she has his vision embedded in her and she knows when she sees something that he would automatically say yes or no to that and based on what he would do she does the same thing so my wife if she knows i'm looking for a generator and she sees one in costco for 30 percent off and it's the last one there she knows that she can buy that and when she brings it home i'm not going to tear her head off for spending a thousand dollars why because i've told her i need to get a generator and i'm looking for a good deal she sees it and gets a great deal for me i'm gonna be happy and i'm gonna be glad that she took that initiative why because she's tied into my vision she's tied into the needs of the family and she's not putting herself above it but she's using what i've given her for the kingdom purpose and then she's using it for the good of the family and whatnot there the money is there the needs there and so my wife would buy it and so would yours i would imagine amen but on the flip side as things grow and as the relationship matures she can look for something for a long time that she would like and she can go buy it eventually and the same thing she doesn't come back and and the husband would say what are you doing with this but he knows that she would never spend the money frivolously until all the needs of the family are met and then she's not going to endanger the finances of the family she's not going to endanger the needs of the family to get what she wants him and she's not going to go out and buy gucci purses and and fancy jimmy choo shoes and and chanel numbers one two three four five six and seven for her perfume counter right if the family doesn't have groceries there he trusts what she's going to use that money for and she has full access and the greater the trust the greater that he the greater latitude he gives sir amen so it's the same thing with god with us is that he gives us a little bit and he sees if we'll use it according to his purpose his kingdom purpose or will we take it and run to create a name for ourselves to create a life of ease or luxury for ourselves if we'll try and prop ourselves up or will we give the glory to him and it based on how we use what he gives us then he decides whether to add to it or take away from it or maybe hold us steady for a while to teach us a little bit more amen it's that trusting and proven relationship brother bob that we know so well isn't it it's a trusting relationship where he knows that you are not going to abuse what he's given you amen what is it we've tempered our inclinations that are there naturally to align with what he wants us to do spiritually amen brother braham says it this way he says god has to find someone that he can trust somebody that he can have confidence in and can have confidence in god that can believe him so this is a two-way street god's looking for someone that can trust him but he's looking god's looking for someone that he can trust but he's also looking for somebody that will trust god because it's no good if he trusts you but you don't trust him and then it's a two-way street you've got to be trusting him as much as he is trusting you he says you believe that don't you sure god has to find somebody who he can put his confidence in and then when he finds such a man that he can put confidence and his power in a man that will follow the road that will stay right on the map see and go right on till he comes to the place of power faith will lead him to that because he's got faith in the word and it'll lead him to the promise he'll lead him to power and power will lead him to the promise notice there he says the power of god will lead you to the promise of god we don't run around like a chicken with his head cut off using the name of jesus christ to get ourselves out of situations to try and address every single thing that we get into where we have a need where there's a bit of discomfort or anything we don't go there flashing the name of jesus like an unlimited credit card do we that's not what he gives it to us for but we have trials we have tribulations and we have difficulties for a purpose and we aren't going around trying to use the name of jesus as a get out of jail card at all amen what we look to the word and see where our authority is to use the power of the authority that he gives us amen that's what he's saying a man that's following the leading of god a man that or a woman that god has confidence in will take whatever power authority he's given and he'll go to the word and say what does the word say that i'm allowed to do with this or what does the word say i'm supposed to do with this you get men that have a gift of healing and they'll sell it out won't they they'll go and you get this guy like peter papa of her one off and he starts selling miracle healing water for 25 for a little bit right that has nothing to do with the gift of god but maybe he's had some success in healing and he uses it to monetize it and make himself a wealthy man god's not going to honor that man for very long and he's going to go into destruction eventually amen but god's looking for somebody when they find themselves with a gift when they find themselves with authority when they find themselves being inclined to do something they go to the word and say is this right before i do it and then they'll apply it in that way brother banham says in adoption he says god knows how much he can trust you he knows how much he can trust me he says listen to this could you imagine a little mouse about that long under the great garners of egypt saying i just better eat two grains a day it may not last through the winter and then when joseph built those great big garners for the wheat that were supposed to last seven years he's saying you got a little mouse under there and he says i can only eat two grains a day otherwise i might run out when you've got tons and tons of it above he could eat every day all day and he'd never run out he says oh my he wants you to ask abundantly so that your joys could be full don't be afraid to ask god for anything for he's willing more willing to give it than you are to receive it if we just get that little shadow wiped away to know he's willing to do it you've got to have a revelation that god wants to give you what you're asking for if you can have faith in it you've got to have faith brother brahm says faith is a revelation of the will of god you've got to believe that it's god's will for you to receive what you're asking for otherwise you're asking what in doubt not in faith he says you're his children he loves you you know how you like to minister and do good things to your children that very strain of fatherhood of a parent to your children comes from god because he's the father of us all and he loves us and he wants to do for us now watch this it says if he can just get us lined up with the blessings and so forth now that's great we want to get lined up with the blessings but watch what he says next and he can trust us then the heavens is open to all of us so we got the blessings here but he says he's getting us to the place where he can trust us to actually receive the blessing again we're not talking about redemptive blessings now but we're talking about kingdom authority we're talking about the the ring of uh and the seal of god amen of the king as well amen so we read that esther had this great deal of authority in this opening scripture in esther eight but she did not get there just by marrying the king but there's something that happened along the way to bring her there and i want to go back a bit and bring us through this to set the type and this is just a type it's a shadow it's not a perfect type of shadow but it gives us an idea of how we're supposed to approach god when it comes to this thing called bright authority esther 2 and verse 12 says now when every maid's term was come to go to go into king of hegeweris after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the woman you know why he said other things is because he couldn't list them all right we know how women are with their beauty regimens don't we there's too many things to put a name on and that's why he says just all the other stuff there's a lot guys we know what went into this amen but i want you to understand that before the any woman went into the king to be presented as to whether he would choose her his queen queen she had to go through 12 months of work and the first six months were with the oil of myrrh now i looked it up and that oil of myrrh has a number of wonderful properties for for for a person's body especially for a woman it is called the world's greatest exfoliation regimen is the oil of myrrh and when they talk about this it's a it's a scraping and a rubbing that they do with this so it's not just simply they pour the mirror on and it does its work but it is scraped and rubbed over their body and it was for the women it was to help heal the dry cracked and skin that was damaged by the wind and dust in the sun so it was it was curing the issues that they had on the outside first of all and then it is anti-bacterial anti-fungal anti-cancer and it's an astringent so it cleans and it purifies and draws out all the things that are causing your skin to have problems amen so in essence the first six months was getting the woman's body to its healthiest natural state it was cleaning up all the stuff that didn't look so good when she went into the king she couldn't have skin problems she meant she couldn't have open wounds she couldn't have acne she couldn't have cracks all over the place right she had to have this natural beautiful tone the first thing they'd do was get out everything bad and then they were going to put in everything good and so for the second six months the first six months was a cleansing ritual it was getting everything out amen it was taking away your flaws but after and and that wasn't fun that's not fun when you're getting all of this stuff pulled out it's a type of sanctification right but after that is six months of pure beautification and it was meant to enhance the natural beauty of the women this wasn't cosmetic surgery but this was meant to enhance who and what they truly were in the first place so with her body in good health and her skin cleared up the focus now was to get her looking as good as she possibly could so they had massages they had hair treatments they had facials they have bubble baths with soft music every day and it was capped off every day by cleansing and perfume so that that perfume was not just something that you sprayed on but it so enveloped you that pretty soon your skin itself became perfume right she didn't have to get up after the end of six months of this of this beauty regimen she didn't have to go every morning because by then she was perfume she had been so infused with this that everywhere she went people could smell the perfume that she'd been bathing in for six months she had a natural odor a natural scent to her that was beautiful right by the time this was done was she had a completely different essence around her if we could put it she'd been completely transformed into the best that she could possibly be amen and then when it's all done she's brought to the king now listen to this it says and thus came every maiden under the king whatsoever she desired was given to her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house so when it was all said and done and she's looking as good as she possibly can she smells amazing her hair is beautiful her skin glows she says she gets to go and whatever is in the the women's house she can take she can take any jewelry she can take any shoes she can take any dresses she can take any hair clips any accessories the most beautiful purse it doesn't matter what she wants anything that's there she can take it to what try and impress the king so that he'll make her queen so every woman gets the same thing and it's her choice not the kings what she's going to wear the king will either like it or he won't but she gets to choose how she's going to present herself to this king it says now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihal the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the woman appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so esther didn't choose her style no doubt esther had a style but she knew if she was going to please the king she needed to dress the way he wanted her to dress and look the way he liked so that she would be accepted as the queen and so she didn't go and say well this is the way i think i look best she went to the king's men to the chamberlain and said what does the king like and whatever he told her the king like was what she dressed as so whatever the outfit was whatever the shoes were maybe whatever it was the accessories maybe he had a really simple taste maybe he just liked a simple tunic with no real jewelry or anything maybe he liked a natural looking woman maybe he liked one with tons of jewelry whatever it was whatever the king likes she said you tell me what he likes and i'll put that on it says when she did she obtained favor in the sight of everyone that looked on her they recognized there was something special about the way she looked brother bam says this way he says esther purged her heart before god and walked up with a meek and humble spirit why she wasn't walking up the way she thought she should she walked up the way he wanted her to and the church that's going to be the bride of christ now remember esther refused the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king what she went before the man that knew the king best and let him tell her how to do it the scripture continues it says so esther was taken under king of hajjuris into his royal house in the 10th month which is the montebeth in the seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti so out of all of them and we don't know how many went we don't know how many went in it could have been dozens could have been hundreds maybe there were thousands that went in before her but the queen loved her more than all and he made her the queen almost immediately amen so we see there's something that happens when we commit ourselves to pleasing god and god alone amen that her focus was to do what the king would love and that was it she didn't add anything she didn't take anything away she went in the way that she was told that he would love and it's no different than ourselves amen when we're more concerned about what he wants when we're concerned more about what he likes that's when we're going to find favor amen we get promoted quickly when our greatest concern is does what i'm doing please god does the life i'm living please god does the things i'm saying please god does the way i'm spending my time please god rather than sitting back and doing what we think will make us look best amen when we put the kingdom purpose first and we choose something that's going to make him smile we'll find will get promoted in authority in the in the kingdom of god a lot more quickly amen now we know shortly after this haman gets mad at mordecai esther's uncle because he refuses to bow to haman and so haman goes in and he he tricks the king and he says there's these bad people in there and they don't respect your your law and they don't respect me and they don't you know they're really we need to get rid of them the king says whatever haman i trust you and he signs into law a decree that will allow haman to kill all of the jews and then so now mordecai finds out about this and the king doesn't know esther's a jew she's been she's hidden this from him because mordecai told her to so she is her life was forfeited as well if haman knew about it as well and wanted to kill her and then it says here this is this is the law that the king signed into into law he says and the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to perish that's legalese there no one would say you can kill anybody but they said it three different ways as to how you can kill them all the jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the 13th day of the 12th month which is the month eight are and to take the spoil of them for the prey so we see the effect we know the story we've read the book of esther and as soon as this hits what do they all do they go into sackcloth and ashes they start mourning woe is me woe is me we're all gonna die and they don't know what they can do about it but then mordecai sends a copy to esther and he asks her he says you need to go to the king and get this changed you need to get it reversed and you need to save your life and you need to save our life and esther said unto them when she gets the message and she said under haytak and gave him commandments on the mordecai all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come into the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live and i have been not called to come in under the king these 30 days so if the king didn't ask you to come into his court and you showed up the king could kill you not only that the king would kill you and the only thing that would keep you from death is if he reached out with his golden scepter towards you that was the only thing that would stop him from killing you was if he reached out his scepter otherwise it was death to enter the king's inner court without an invitation and esther says look it's one thing for me to go in but he hasn't called me into his court for 30 days i haven't seen him in 30 days i haven't been in his presence for 30 days i haven't talked to him i haven't texted with him nothing i haven't been around the king for 30 days so there's some danger here because he hasn't been calling me to him there's been a separation between us it says and they told then they and then they told to mordechai esther's words and then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not within thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews in other words your jew too if they if they find out they can kill you as well for if thou all together hold us thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this sometimes we're put in tough places purely because we are a child of god and we have access to one who can change the situation and it's not always about us often it's about somebody else that has nobody to go into the presence of the king for them to ask for favor now esther she could stay nobody would know she was a jew he says look yes you may you may get away with it he says but we'll all be destroyed if we don't but he says maybe this is the very reason that you've been made a queen in the first place is so that you can save your people from an evil man like this and it's no different from us brother joe and i were talking about the opportunity and the mindset we ought to have when people meet us when we get into situations with people it is not by chance amen they have an opportunity to meet a living god when they come in and they talk to us and they see the way we live and there's an opportunity for us to intercede for those people to have an impact in their lives if we can have the right attitude in the right spirit amen we're in a special place and he's saying look esther you're in a special place and guess what this is probably the reason for it then esther bade then returned mordecai this answer she said go and gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him now i want to stop here for a second because sometimes we can get mixed up in our in in our understanding of relationship and position and authority because many of us in esther's place might have said listen this is a this is this is coming against my life i'm his wife i can just march down there walk right through those doors and go right up to him and get him to fix it i'm the queen he loves me he wants me to do this i should just walk in and do this many of us would perhaps say that wouldn't we it's mine by right he married me he put me in this place it's a threat against my life i have a right to go in and talk to him immediately maybe others of us would say what well let's go talk to the general and let's tell them we need a hundred thousand troops in the jewish quarter here and in all the cities of the land so that my family can be protected right he'll obey me because he knows i'm the queen and he knows if he doesn't he's good he's gonna get into some hot water right she could have risen up in the authority of her position and tried to force these things to go her way she could have went there and tried to say hey come on i know you're doing something right now but you need to listen to me whatever you're doing is less important than me because i'm your i'm your queen i'm your wife right and she'd force him to choose and possibly embarrass him in front of his uh of the other people and these different things but there's a reverence there's a respect there's a carefulness towards the king that esther exhibits here she doesn't just march in and it's not just because she's afraid of the law though that's certainly there but there's a carefulness because she knows that he doesn't separate himself from her for no good reason she's his wife she's the love of his life she's the one that he prefers above all the other women in the kingdom so if he's separated himself for a while it's for a purpose right and so she knows that she shouldn't just go in there because he only separates himself for a reason amen brother branham says how many times that god will step away from a situation just to see what you will do right what do we see here he separated himself now he doesn't know what's going on but there's a reason for it and esther is going to have to prove to herself that she values the relationship more than she values her own life amen she knows her husband the king does things a certain way and she's going to respect that she's not just going to barge herself but i want you to see what she does she doesn't just barge in and say all right you convinced me i got to go in so i'm going to go in but what does she do she says everybody fast and pray right they don't just fast jews don't do just fast they fast and pray there's a reason to fast and that's to dedicate yourself to getting close to god to get a focus on what you're needing an answer for to get serious to sanctify your life to get all of the distractions out and then after that time of fasting it's supposed to bring the answer that you're looking for so she gets her to so esther says i'm gonna fast my servants are gonna fast all the jews i want all of you to fast and pray for three days and then after that i'm gonna go in and what's esther doing in that time she's praying lord how do i do this how do i approach it amen how do i approach my husband the king so that he'll save our lives that's her only focus is to go in there and her life will be spared so that she can make a request to the king to do this brother abraham says it this way he says now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first you're making a decision pray about it amen there's nothing that we should have to make a decision on where we don't have time to pray first there's always time to pray and seek the will of god amen if it's god's will he'll make a way no matter how long we wait seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added i am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking and their attitude will be perfect in the sight of god that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed i want power what does he say get in line with god's word get your attitude your thinking and your soul perfect in the sight of god amen get yourself aligned don't seek power seek alignment and the power and authority will follow after that amen that's what esther did and we see the results that brought him in she didn't just step up and ask but she prayed and fasted before the approach to the king and we know that her approach was perfect so i want you to see how she does this as she goes in esther 5 1 says now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel jin just put on her nice clothes but she put on her royal apparel she dressed according to her position she put on the clothes that the king had given her she wasn't scared to go in in her position and neither are we to be amen we don't have to go into the presence of the lord pretending we're nobody if he has made us his queen we dress like his queen we act like his queen amen there's nothing wrong with going in knowing your position but in knowing your position don't forget the respect and reverence that's due him amen she stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight she didn't obtain favor by talking she got favor by waiting for his acknowledgement amen and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand so esther jr and touched the top of the scepter then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther he's reminding her of her position there it's not just esther he says queen esther he's acknowledging her position he's acknowledging that she's come in dressed in it and he's giving her respect for her position as well what will thou queen esther and what is our request it shall be given thee even to half of the kingdom now put yourself in her position you've fasted for three days you've prayed your fellow believers have all done the same you're in the presence of the king he's extended the scepter of grace to save your life he's called you forward and he's offered you everything up to half of what he has and then he trusts his queen right his relationship with her is still strong he hasn't seen her in 30 days but that doesn't mean he doesn't trust her hey man he hasn't lost his love what would you do you prayed about this situation for three days you prayed for an answer to gain grace in the eyes of the king and what would you do what would you do in that what would we say praise the lord this is what we prayed for i don't have to do anything i walk in i find grace and favor in a sight i can ask what he wants because he's telling me i can have whatever i want up to half of his kingdom isn't that what we do most of us i can say that's what i do you go into the presence of the king and you'd start asking as soon as he gives you the go as soon as the green light comes on whatever you want up to half the kingdom you say i got a i got a need i got something i need to talk to you about that's what most of us would do right what would we say lord i want the salvation of my kids i want a new job i want a new house i want a new car i want this trial to go away i want my healing whatever it is we'd start asking for that immediately as soon as the presence comes down we start asking watch her learn and listen brothers amen how often we miss the greater blessing because we're so focused on getting the blessing for ourselves esther answered if it seemed good unto the king let the king and haman come this day into the banquet that i have prepared for him lord come to my house i made a welcoming feast for you i've got the best food i've got everything that you love i've got air conditioning i've got it laid out so that you just have to come in and you can eat and relax i haven't seen you in 30 days i know that you only do that when you have things to do you're busy you're probably stressed you need a place of comfort and quiet lord i've got a place to bring you out from all of what you've been doing i have a place of rest for you prepared where you can enjoy where you can be the focus of people remember you can get away where you can have some time away and be refreshed amen in her great needs she still knew that she needed to refresh the relationship before she moved into what she was going into amen and what is she doing here she's reminding him of the very reason that he picked her in the first place and that's because she's more intent with pleasing him than she is about getting what she wants and then she's more focused on what he thinks and what matters to him than what matters to her amen the very thing of this series on thy kingdom what come is what when we look at the lord's prayer we are always looking to what he wants before we look to our own need amen we say lord thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as is in heaven and then we say give us this day our daily bread amen amen healing finances provision direction whatever it is that comes after we say lord what does your kingdom need first amen what can i do for you lord before i ask you to do something for me amen amen when we first look to his kingdom to his purpose to his will to his needs before we ask our own that's where we start to get into an authority position amen call it selfish of god if you want but he's god amen god is an object of worship god is an object of praise and he expects it from us amen and it's not something that we do out of out of rote or because we have to but we do it out of a willing heart because of who he is amen because of what he's done and then it we see the same thing and and this might sound a little crass when we compare it to god but they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach and really what that's saying is when you fulfill the need of that man he's never more willing to do something for you than when his needs been met as well amen and it's no different with god is that when you've done what he has asked you to do then he's never more willing to give you something that you've asked for as well amen brother braham said seek ye first the kingdom of god have you ever witnessed that to be the truth put god first pay your tithes first do you want financial blessing pay your tithes first don't wait for the blessing to pay your tithes pay your tithes first every time pay everything first pay god pray first morning pray all through the day give god the first place and everything and you'll be a witness what of the good things of god esther looked to her husband the king's need first and she put his needs ahead of her own even with her life hanging in the balance she still put his needs ahead of her own then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther has said so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther prepared the king was perfectly willing to drop all of his special things that he was doing to go relax with esther amen she met the need he loved what she proposed right there was something that she said there that drew him in that made him willing to leave everything behind all the rules of court and all the different needs that were there all the politicking and this and that he left all of it to go do what she wanted then the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom shall it be performed now if we were sitting next to esther we'd say this is the time esther this is what we prayed about you've done your part now now you get your part talk to him he's in a great mood he's full of food he's relaxed he's smiling he's happy he's air conditioned now now esther this is a time you've done everything you've done everything he could ever expect now's the time to ask esther save yourself esther what does esther say then answered esther and said my petition and my request is if i have found favor in the sight of the king and if it pleased the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do tomorrow as the king has said she's still looking to do something for her king before she ever asks him to come out and do what he needs she needs him to do amen though her life is still in the bounce yet she is still staying true to her purpose and that is what to do something for him before she asks him to do something for her speaking of the widow woman and the prophet elijah brother brown says this he says the widow woman said i have just enough for me and my little starving boy and i'm out here getting these two sticks i've just mixed it together and dressed it now i've got these two sticks to make a fire to make the cake and he and i will eat it and die she started to turn again and she heard a voice saying but bring me one first what do we learn here seek ye first the kingdom of god how will i meet it how will i do what i need to do how will i live lord if i give everything to you he says i can't tell you but you put god first seek ye first the kingdom of god in his righteousness and all these other things will be added but bring me one first look she didn't have to go down and get her last penny she had to go down and get her last piece of bread she didn't have to go for this or that or maybe change doctors or so forth some little insignificant thing but she had to go to the only thing that stood between her and death and her child bring me a little cake first in your hand i can see her not her head obedient that's what god requires you get the word and the spirit mixed together self-sacrifice and obedience he says when god's prophet says a certain thing do it hold on to it he says how do we get there seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things will be added how do i know brother branham how do i know the only thing i know put god first and move on sacrifice mix the oil mix the word and the spirit together lay yourself upon the cross and say here i am lord put god first in everything what about that to do to our lives amen are we always pushing ourselves to the front and claiming our position i hear it preach so often that you've got to speak the word and you're this and you're that and the other thing but how many of us have the relationship that esther's showing us behind the speaking of that word amen you can't be in a position until god puts you there and you can speak the word all day long but if he doesn't trust you by relationship he's never going to promise meet the promise of his word to you you can do it till you're blue in the face we see a million denominationals out there doing it every day and he doesn't honor his word because they're not in a relationship with him esther's proving here the widow woman proved that she would put god above all else even to the point where obedience would mean death within the next couple of days amen are we so focused on ourselves that we forget that we need to worship and praise the god that we ask so much of amen amen our actions reveal our attitude to what's first in our life and too often i fear we are number one in our own lives and by that i mean we're always asking but we're not giving right we're always requesting but we're never offering amen esther proves here the attitude to get to a place of authority and that is first by sacrifice and second by proving in a trusting relationship amen don't get me wrong this is not just for the women tonight this is for men and women like i said i'm preaching to the bride of christ collectively here we ought to look to the needs of our spouse a wife is not only obligated to look to the needs of her husband the husband is absolutely required above and beyond that to look to the needs of his wife he is the great provider amen we're all supposed to be looking at that but if we're focused on christ the truth and the principle still stands though he's supposed to look out for us there is a response that we are supposed to have and it is always to put him in a position that is first in our lives and that means he's ahead of us even amen if you want authority you're going to have to come by the way of focusing on the purpose of your husband christ rather than your own every time it's got to be that amen you don't get authority so that you can do your own thing so often that's what we want is we want a third authority that gives us permission to do what we wanted to do all along and god will never give you authority if that's what you're looking for but he gives you authority so that you can do what he wants you to do and then he's giving you the authority to use the power of the kingdom of god to achieve his purpose not to achieve your own amen there's no time that i'm so willing to spend money is when my wife comes to me with a a plan or a purpose that aligns perfectly with mine why because the purpose is supported by the cost the cost is supported by the purpose what she's asking me to spend money on what she's asking me to put time into is align perfectly with the vision that i have for the family and when she does that i have no problem spending money and god's the exact same way he's written blank checks but he honors the ones that are aligned with the kingdom amen esther 7 we see what happens it says so the king and haman came to the bank with esther the queen and the queen king said again under esther on the second day of the banker of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom then ants then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favor in thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request now i love this part because esther doesn't say lord i put so much time and effort into this i've made this beautiful spread for you i've slaved for two days to make it perfect i brought in things from all over the kingdom from all over the world to give you just the food and the feast that you wanted lord i've done all these things i'm a great christian i'm a wonderful person i've kept all the rules and i've believed everything you've said and i've gone to church every service esther does not say what i've done is worthy of my request she says if what i've done is of worth to you then give me my life she says lord you be the judge of what i've done for you she doesn't sit there and say i'm the best i'm amazing lord i'm the greatest christian in your kingdom she says if there's anything i've done that has pleased you let me have my life she says let your response be a reflection of your appreciation don't let me tell you what you like god let you express what you like based on how you answer me she says for we are sold i am my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we have been sold for bond men and bond woman i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage and the king of hashwares answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that does presume in his heart to do so show me the man that did this let me adam is what he's saying this is not a happy husband this is not a happy king and let me tell you when a king gets unhappy you don't want to be in the same room with him amen but i want you to catch here that god opens up a hedge of protection around us to train us and to teach us and to cause us to grow because the only reason that haman has access to esther is by one thing and that's the law of the king did you notice that the king is the one that gave him the law that could destroy did you know christ did the same thing he said the day you eat thereof is the day you'll die what did he do he gave power to satan to bring death on there right in the first it's the law of the king that gave satan power in the first place but when he extends the scepter of grace what is it it overrides the law doesn't it and allows her to now come back with something that doesn't undo it but it gives him a what a weapon a defense against it so that it has no effect on them anymore amen you could preach that for a service i'll tell you amen the king gave power to to haman that could potentially destroy esther but it was all for a purpose amen don't look where you are now by eyes of flesh lies of carnality by your emotions and concerns and worries look to what god has said amen i like what brother gerald read there in the last service where he says what that god is not taken by surprise god is not fooled right the devon's lesson get one over on god when we go into hard times but rather god allows it for a purpose and it is to draw us into a closer relationship with him amen and esther said the adversarian enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen i would imagine he was very very very afraid amen and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and haman stood up to make requests for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king very perceptive man then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed where esther was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the house and as the words went out of the king's mouth they covered haman's face the servants grabbed him and covered his head and prepared him for death he says will he force him he he literally climbed on her to plead for his life and the king took it as a sign that he was trying to force her it says in harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king behold also the gallow 50 cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who spoke good for the king standeth in the house of haman then the king said hang him thereon. so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai then was the king's wrath pacified now you'd think that'd be the end of it haman's dead who's going to enforce this law but the thing is this went out to all of the kingdom and everybody was told the jews are there's open season on the jews on this one day you got one day to take them out but whoever you kill you can take their property so everybody knows on that one day they get to have a heyday with the jews and they can take all of the things that they've ever gathered together they can take their houses they can take their their wealth they can take their porsche they can take their rolex watch whatever it is they've got they can go in and take it so even with haman dead the danger is still there amen and that's what brings us to the scripture that we opened up with amen but as we read it i want you to put it into the place that brought esther to the place where the king's going to give the ring of power to her because look at her mindset look at her approach look at her attitude in this it is not one of presumption it has never won a presumption it is always one of relationship and respect and reverence for her husband so we're going to read esther 8 again and it says on that day did the king of hegewears give the king of haman the jew's enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordechai remember the king had given we didn't read it but the king had given his ring to mordecai or to haman to write the other law and haman had had it until that point the king takes it back and now he gives it to mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden scepter toward his toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king now watch and learn again watch her attitude and said if it pleased the king and if i have found favor in his sight and the things seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hamadatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king's provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred amen we're so often certain of the path that we need to walk down to get things done we've got the answer and we bring it to god and we say lord this is what i'm praying for lord this is the way this needs to happen esther doesn't show us that she says look i've got an idea lord but if it pleases you and if i found favor and it's right and i'm pleasing then please do this she puts it right back on him and says lord i've got an idea i don't know if it's right or wrong you're the king you're the one that knows best i'm giving you the suggestion now you do whatever you want to do in this situation amen sometimes our prayers are too focused and that we're telling god what to do rather than saying lord here's the need and you do it the way you feel best amen sometimes we miss that perfect will because we're so insistent that we found the answer instead of letting the great god that knows all things and sees all things bring the answer our way amen what are we doing we're saying god i'm offering a solution but i'm letting you make the call that's just what she's teaching us to do amen what an attitude she's in the driver's seat he's given her everything she wants he says you can do it and she still comes back and says lord i'm gonna let you tell me if this makes sense if this is something that you're going to put your stamp of approval on and then she deferred right back to him every time it says then the king of hajj where said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him have they hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews this is the authority she gets now right ye also for the jews as it liketh you in other words you do whatever you want write whatever you want decree whatever you want put it down and i'll enforce anything that you write she's given him a solution he says you're good to go write whatever you want i'll enforce it she's got full of thing she's got full kingdom authority everything in the kingdom is behind her at this point whatever she writes the king's gonna support it he says what right ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man reverse who's writing it esther who's signing it the king it's not esther that's going to make it happen it's the king that signs it that's going to make it happen amen now she has it now she has the ring of authority she has a seal of the king she has his name behind anything she writes down and we know what she writes is that we are allowed to defend ourselves against anything that comes towards us right god couldn't undo the law but he fulfilled the law and then he gave us what by grace he gave us something to defend against every enemy that the every weapon that the enemy could bring against us amen he couldn't stop the enemy because the enemy still had the law right under sin he's allowed to attack right but he gives us grace and he gives us the holy ghost and he gives us the word to fight against him so that anything that comes against us we have a right to stand up against it amen that we can push back and keep him off of ours you'll notice and just for the sake of time i didn't put it in here when they wrote it that the jews they fought and they killed everyone that came against them but they didn't take a single thing from them it's a type for us we're not there to take anything from this world they come against us what we're doing is defending our property and then we're not going to take theirs they have nothing that we want amen but when they come for something that we have we say you can't have it and we take care of business with anybody that comes our way amen they took no spoil from them but they killed everyone that came against them amen and they hung his sons haman had nobody left after this heyman's family was completely destroyed by the time the jews got through with them brother brown says this he says when all hell turns loose what's turned loose on you what are you fighting what's the situation feels like all hell sometimes doesn't it you get to focusing on the wrong things seems like everything's weighing you down all hell's against you the prophet said when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose also he'll give you everything you need to win the victory i'm reminded of daniel when he prayed and he was looking for an answer and he got delayed by three weeks the answer took three weeks and the angel when it finally came says you got heard on the first day the answer was given but i ran into trouble i there why because it's a spiritual battle right we we think that god is all-powerful and so he just zips things around here but there is a kingdom outside of this that we don't see there's a spiritual warfare that's going on and that that messenger angel that came to daniel was delayed and he needed help to get the message through but the message was coming no matter what and the victory was coming no matter what but there was a delay between the answering and the receiving of the answer amen but what heaven was turned loose until the answer came amen when help was needed help was provided and daniel got his answer but daniel didn't run away did he daniel didn't falter back and say the answer's not here yet i guess i'm wrong i guess i i guess i should start being worried i guess i should fall back on the arm of flesh no daniel stayed in prayer until the answer came amen he trusted his god would come all the way through when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against it and these two forces is always showed at the junction it is not a natural battle we fight it is not a battle for finances it is not a battle for health it is not a one for for strong emotions for great relationships it's a spiritual battle that we fight and you've got to recognize that all of heaven is behind you to make the victory come to the bride of christ amen but you've got to have a relationship before he's going to give you the authority to use it all but ram says i said if god speaks or sends you he backs up what you say see notice if you're an ambassador from heaven all of heaven is behind you and heaven is consisted of the word take it back to the word every time if you've got a word promise if you've got a word unction if you've got a word that's pushing you then you can know that heaven is behind every one of us amen look at esther she didn't walk up and wrench authority out she didn't seduce it out she didn't manipulate it out but she showed reverence and respect for the things of her husband for the kingdom of her husband and in that she gained a position where he trusted her to do the right thing with his authority amen she humbled herself to the kingdom need and he gave her everything that her heart desired in response to that amen let's bring it down to our doorstep and we'll be closing and then this will be where we'll start the next service lord willing matthew 18 says verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven is that our scripture that's our scripture amen again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven you notice that the king had two there he had mordecai and esther he didn't have one he had two he trusted mordecai and he trusted esther put them together and he knew that they were going to come up with something good he said that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name amen you got to have the name you've got to have the seal of that name the holy spirit there am i in the midst of them one last quote as we close it says but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride the person here there here off somewhere else some other church some other denomination whatever it is she believes the word of god obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she's watching for it she's part of that word and she is watching for her life to manifest that word amen musicians if you would come amen i'm looking for this i'm looking for this with expectation i'm looking for for matthew 18 with expectation that when we ask in his name where two or three of us agreeing at that he answers amen that he gives us what we're seeking amen but i want to check up and say am i approaching it the way that esther did because if she got a response we'll get a response amen that we can't presume to venture without authority but the authority has to be given to us so that there's no presumption in our actions amen and the question i'm asking is am i seeking his kingdom or am i seeking my kingdom amen am i seeking the benefits why am i seeking the benefactor you know that song help me want the healer more than the healing help me want the savior more than the saving these different things i want to ask you is there a relationship there that's keeping you tied regardless of whether he says yes or no to your request because whether or not i say yes or no to my wife she's still going to love me isn't she and whether or not that that relationship will be built to the point where what it doesn't matter what my answer is she's still going to want to be around me and i'm going to want to be around her and then because we're loving him based on who he is not what he provides us every time amen we've got to come to the place where we have a relationship i like what brother branham said you know put him first he says what do you do first thing in the morning pray talk talk have a conversation it's not a good day when we walk out the door and don't talk to our spouse is it we want to have that quick connection say hello how did the night go how you feeling this morning give him a kiss give him a hug before you go out the door pray together as a family as the case may be what to just make that connection so that we know that we're going to be good for the day right to touch up make sure everything's okay esther had been away from the king for 30 days and she wanted to get she wanted to catch up first she wanted to get what reconnected with her relationship with her husband before she started dumping her load on him as well amen she had a concern for him as well for his well-being our attitude our motive our objective should be first and foremost for the king and his kingdom and in doing so that's when we've received the authority of the kingdom amen what are you seeking today what's your prayer been have you been praying have you been talking to god amen what's your heart's crying heart's desire one thing i would ask tonight is lay it aside let's just worship him for a bit let's just thank him let's just give him some time brother bob i appreciate the song serves you're right on the money with so many of those where it was about thanks and what he has done and what he's promised he will do and i think sometimes we don't spend enough thanking him for that and praising him for it and we keep moving on to the next blessing and the next blessing the next situation the next worry the next trial and he's saying but what about what i've done already what about that are you just coming for the gold are you just coming for the good things of god rather than of god himself let's just stand together if we would and just lay aside let's just lay aside our needs for a little bit if we would and can we just worship him a bit we're just going to sing a few songs here but can we just worship him for a bit and thank him for who he is and for what he's done for a little bit amen and then make him feel welcome amen let him know that we appreciate him let me know that we have acknowledged let him know that we acknowledge what he's doing amen that we trust him and that even though lives may hang in the balance even though relationships may hang in the balance even though finances might lay in the balance even though health might lay in the balance we're going to give him some of our time for just him now for a little bit and trust him to come and meet our needs in due time amen let's just bow our heads for a moment heavenly father lord so often we forget to be thankful lord for forgive us lord or for where we fall short and lord we just keep coming for more and more and we stop lord we don't stop to acknowledge or your goodness and grace and the many blessings you've given us heavenly father lord we want to worship you we were made to worship and praise you lord your word says that for you and by you all things were made and by you all things consist lord we were made for your glory and for your worship and lord we want to do that tonight we just want to thank you lord for how you've answered prayer lord we thank you for the promise of the word we thank you for a message that brings us clarity lord that restores us back to the faith of the original pentecostal fathers lord god and lord i believe they were in that upper room praying and worshiping lord that they were in expectation of the infilling of the presence of god in their lives and lord i believe we need a fresh anointing i believe we need a fresh infilling lord we need a renewal of our spirit to bring a spirit of praise on our lips lord that we will confess the word of god day in and day out lord that our very nature will be a spirit of praise and worship lord knowing that you do all things well and that in your time lord the answer will come our way lord just accept us now lord we pray as we draw close to you in jesus name we ask it amen let's sing that song i worship you almighty god 882. i
