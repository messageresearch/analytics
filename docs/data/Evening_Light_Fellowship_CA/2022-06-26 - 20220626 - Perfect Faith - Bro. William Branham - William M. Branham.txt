and [Music] he's my lord [Music] amen yes amen [Music] praise the lord amen [Music] yes [Music] praise the lord amen [Music] praise the lord amen we're going to have a message by the prophet and i thought i had the information here written down for a brother brother oh advisor here okay just to see now exactly oh my oh yes here it is the message is uh perfect faith amen and brother adam preached it in 1963 august the 25th and it'll be less than an hour of the portions that we're going to hear and we're praying the grace of god to be with us the grace of god be with those that are not with us amen and trusting that even though it's they're they're not here i trust by grace because it is on a sunday i trust that their spirit is is with us amen by the grace of god and no matter where you go oh my praise the lord brother ramsey one time if he went to a city and he said there was no message church there he always said he'd go look for the the pentecostal church oh yeah he said i i'll go to the pentecost church he said why to worship the lord amen so i pray the grace of god that our brothers and sisters wherever they are they'll stay mindful of the lord amen they'll stay mindful that that maybe millions around the world will be worshipping them today amen lord so i pray the grace of god that will worship him in the hearing of the word the going further the word because faith comes by hearing amen hearing the word by the grace of god and again it's the faith that pleases god so i trust that we're going to hear the word hear the revelation hear thus sayeth the lord and here it is written amen and again this again as i said the republic god brought this message in his own tabernacle in the branham tabernacle in jeffersonville august 1963 and of course it is one of the message that believers highlight oh yes there's there's a number of messages that we go through and especially if the prophet preached it in jeffersonville we put some emphasis on it because if he had the more liberty and the more freedom to preach whatever the lord laid on his heart when he was in jeffersonville amen so so pay close attention to the word amen and to what he's saying god is requiring it of us oh yes so brother sister we're going to answer for what he's preaching answer for what he has preached and brother and what he's preaching here in benham tabernacle and it's a tremendous message and for me at least anyhow because i've been through this message a number of times and as i've said before i said if you can see the message oh it's green it's orange it's yellow and it's uh underlined with the with the pen that's the different times i went through this message and one time basically the first time maybe i underlined it with pen and maybe the first time i ever read the message some years ago and then when another time it went through oh yeah and i highlighted certain things with yellow certain things with orange certain things with green and so on amen why because oh every time we go through it we we we catch certain things we never caught before amen so let's be on our guard the stoners don't assume oh it's just another message by william branham it's another message all right but it's another message by the prophet oh yes and brother there's there's messages that god ordained him to minister and to preach and especially in jeffersonville amen in his own in his own assembly and i think this is one of the most important messages that the prophet has highlighted perfect faith so i pray the grace of god challenge our faith do you have perfect faith amen oh faith is a revelation so we got the perfect revelation you better you better have it in your heart not in your head oh we got the perfect revelation of the word god said this god said that yes but is it really faith that you believe faith is that we believe amen so brother we believe thus saith the lord we believe it is written by the grace of god and the prophet of god in another message he said speak the word and he said why cry he said speak amen why i'll tell you this if the devil is going to listen to anything he'll listen to the word oh yeah he is one if there's anything that he fears it's the word of god amen so i trust by the grace of god well i pray grace that we got more faith than the devil god he's come to a great wrath as i said the other night he knowing his time is short how did you know that he knows that by the word you know that by the revelation of of of god through the ages and so on so brother what out we to know amen satan is there and oh yeah and only that he's got great wrath he's angry but he's also fearful so i pray lord that we have the fear of the lord that we're going to pay attention to the word the devil fears god and he pays attention to the word oh he knows he knows that god never said this and he's oh he might do it and he may not do it he knows god's going to do it oh yeah because he knows the word will never fail praise the lord so i trust by grace that we believe the word that we're going to keep feeding on the word by the grace of god amen so lord bless us and let's sing only believe all things are possible only believe as we go to the word and to give this to our brother oh our sister or sister amber pick this up give it to our brother do you know when to start the message where to start it rather and where to stop it amen only believe all things are possible only billy oh only believe oh only believe [Music] all things are possible yes only believe amen please in your heart in your soul

the name of our savior jesus christ amen and amen and amen god bless you you may be seated as we go to the to the message amen amen praise the lord perfect faith by the grace of god to turn to mark saint mark 11th chapter of saint martin and we're going to begin to read about the the 22nd verse of the 11th chapter of saint mark and many of you know this scripture it's very familiar it was a scripture i was thinking on uh brother russell when those when he spoke to me and said about those squirrels and they that was just the very scripture i was thinking of it's always been a puzzle he said if ye say not if i say if you say now let us read jesus answering said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those saints which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen therefore i say unto you what things forever you desire when you pray believe that ye receive them and you shall have them and when you stand please forgive if you have all against any that your father also that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespass but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now faith is based on forgiveness now and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door yeah we see it but we want to see more of it we wanted such a flow that it it'll be a help to us to flow out to others remember jesus as we had in the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was set for and you think sometimes why would a man that was so full of power like him would have ever be sick yes sir i've read and some books somewhere where when he raised up that boy for the widow's son from nan i believe that prince the house of david that he stepped on a rock and thrown with a headache he bore our infirmities bear means to pack like we have he had sickness he had temptations he had trouble he had flusteration just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator so he had to be partakers the husband and of the fruit before you even know the woman has to well and many things see if we look right into the scripture now i want to say that i believe every scripture never been up to this room thus critics today that don't want to believe that a critic once said that when jesus sent those disciples to where that cult was high or two ways met that he pre-arranged that for where that quote was time see they don't understand that god rearranges god told me other day was brother down here that i would shake his hand on the street again that's very strange i wasn't here that morning but two minutes longer or a minute longer i have not met him on the street but i stepped off the car just in time to shake his hands when he was coming in on the street he didn't know he had his glasses off he couldn't see me when he heard my voice he started crying what was it usually he doesn't do that but it was the answer to what was told him up there under the oxygen he would do it i said you were also set in the church again his heart's desire was having chicago meeting he wanted to come to that meeting his heart was part i sent him a telegram and greetings for us the children told him was praying that he could get well right quick and a loving brother who visited him said that you he just wanted to come so bad but here he says tonight see that was not pre-arranged the same god arranges he makes everything work perfectly on the dollar amen a critic once said that no wonder jesus could take five loaves and feed five thousand said the loaves were bigger in that day and he just cut each soap to feed a thousand i'll give you to understand a little boy had it in his lunch a little child packed five bowls of bread that could feed five thousand people then what about the twelve basketballs taking up action oh they just that's just critics that's awesome that doesn't change god's word it's just the same thing moves on now we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith perfect faith that's a great thing now a faith we're told in the bible faith cometh by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe is there that really nothing else will detect there but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for this prayer line in the next few minutes now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and it's impossible to to please god without faith you cannot please and if you say you believe god you have never seen him see so then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could sin it would be no more faith the anything that the census declares is no more faith it's a scientific fact see it's not no more faith but you have to accept him by faith and he that cometh to god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word of god amen you must first believe this is god's word and you must come to god by the word amen see just take the word what it says and that's right everything else contrary to it is not right abraham had to believe just what that boss told him and when he was 100 years old 25 years later he was stronger believe that he was 25 years ago when it was given to him he believed it and he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god knowing that he was able to perform what he promised that's why everyone must be that way you must come with an unfailing faith believing that god made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that faith and that's what we're going to talk about to receive that faith in hebrews the book of hebrews 11th chapter we are told that faith is the substance of things hoped far now here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for because they take faith to be something that it is not see they don't believe it it's um it's not a imagination it is a actual substance now listen closely it is not what you imagine it's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else it's just as real as my eyes says this is a piece of paper it's just as real as to say that that that is a lie it's just as real as the that i feel my coat it's just as real as the as i hear that baby talking uh there or making this noise see it's just that real it's music playing it's just as real as i taste anything in my mouth it is that real only you can't show it to somebody else you have our own amen it's yours faith is the substance amen see it's not just a myth so many people come out these are real deep lessons and i'll catch the top of it and then you dig down in it notice it is something that you possess not imagination if you really have it it's just as real to you as any other thing that could be it's just as real as as you know that that you're riding your automobile it's just as real as you know that you're studying in the church it's just as real as you hear my boy it is a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of god in that only amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god that puts it back so where your faith in is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not an organization it's not in a group of people it's in god because god is the word amen your faith is in god they promised by hearing the word of god then when god by his word not what somebody else did somebody else did but by what god's word said he said let every man's words be alive and mine be true amen now you see somebody else do something by a word act of god or promise of god and many of them say i can do that too it's an imagination and when they do you find them rigged up out there somewhere yes it's got to be a substance now that is potentially a faith that is something that would bring you to a faith it's potentially like if you ask me for an oak tree and i'll give you an acorn potato you have an oak tree but it hasn't produced itself yet but when it really brings itself out it is an oak tree and when you imagine that god does this but when it's revealed to you it's a faith thing perfect faith that cannot fail yeah that's the reason those visions are so so tremendous to me because it's been proved right every time see and i know that he promised that and he promised in his word and here he comes and promises for this day therefore you know where you're standing when he says so that gives me a faith because he never does nothing contrary to his written word see and if it was contrary to the word i couldn't have faith in it brings it right back again to the word see faith in hearing the word of god you must share the word god's word is that all sufficient word that's all you have need of is this word now faith being the substance and in there we find out in hebrews what faith was and what those did who had faith see there's many times that people have faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it the next day there's something and something else but when god wants anchors and you see us there's nothing ever going to make you move from it you're just poking reaching pursuing and pursuing this adventure without authority you're just trying this and trying this and go to this one and run here and run there you haven't got the faith yet but when that is what we call things excuse me i want you to thank you i i want you to get this now we the church has got to lift itself in the power of god how we're too close to the end now and i believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make-believe out get into something real see it's got to be something that you know if you say um uh brother branham uh that isn't the line yet i'll know it's a lie how do you know it's right i'm looking at it well how do you know what you could be wrong my side has always declared to me that that was life see and that's the reason i believe those visions because it's always declared to me the truth that comes from the word amen then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it just pass the law see because it's beyond the human thinking it's up into the realm of the large but you're standing here just as divine just as a branch producing the fruit that's in the vine see god uses now and man only god doesn't use machinery god doesn't use groups to man god doesn't use organization god uses individuals always now faith is the substance and by we understand all those things are done it's not a it's not a imagination it is a substance especially perfect faith that's what i'm talking all tonight getting to perfect faith it is not an imagination now other just people can say well i got all faith oh i sure have or are you standing here for us you can see see your your very actions prove that you haven't got what you're talking about see if you have faith in where you're standing for airlines what do you do these things for see if you had perfect faith you'd look right straight to god and believe it and walk away and you would you would have no need of coming into a crowd you'd have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so and i see what would be the use for me saying i got to put a shirt on i got a shirt on how do you know you got a shirt or i see it feel it and i know it's there well that's just how real that when perfect faith takes the whole you don't need no more great god already done you know hallelujah how do you do it faith tells me so hey man that's it see do you get it now one of these that's perfect faith not always i'm venturing out well i'll go the bible stick hold the elders let them know i want to pray over i know i'll go and you say well i'm going to be healed you're making yourself don't watch how you're going to make yourself just it's worked out then when he passed you you say oh i still don't feel see there he was you didn't have faith your genuine faithful do it right there your your 29 faith will make it so surreal to you that look at the other woman with the blood issue she said if i can only touch the border of his garment i'll be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issues stopped and she actually believed it and when she touched it the through that stopped it stopped jesus turned and said who touched me that's perfect faith and that same perfect faith tonight will touch jesus christ just as it did then a woman come with a perfect faith for that time now now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they had christ walking with him but then afterwards christ was in that amen and so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the holy spirit it has to bring it it does now you say the disciples didn't have perfect faith no or they had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil and they couldn't do it and the father seen jesus coming and he said we have brought my son to your disciples and they could not cure him and afterwards the disciples asked jesus saying why could not we cure him and jesus says because of the lack of faith and of your unbelief that's right because of your unbelief that i remember they had this house jesus had given them power the healer was sick to raise the dead and cast out devils just a few days before that yeah they had the power but not the faith to use the power now there's the brand tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is shared with the power amen but you haven't got that faith and movement amen see what it means to move it here i got a shell that i hand loaded i know what it'll do by ballistic like the word but i've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the powder the powder's got the power but it's got to have the fire to light off and the same thing that powers in the shell but it needs bait to charge it and throw it out that's what it takes the perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now since he's come upon us amen faith to ignite to see great things the faith something that presents it to you for the heart full of joy you walk into the stick room knowing exactly what you're going to say something's already been revealed and you know it when you walk in in the name of jesus christ rise up from there say up the law here you are that's a perfect faith if there's these 10 million people centered it wouldn't happen you know what's going to happen anyhow because you know it is going to happen regardless what anybody else says you're the ones got the faith could you imagine joshua he called the elders of israel together and said uh brethren we are the servants of the lord i would like for you to say uh ask the lord if it'd be all right if uh if he'd give us a little more sunlight see and hold his son no he has need of it and without prayer without anything he had need of it and he just commanded the son he said stand there amen i have need and i'm in the service of the lord and he sent me over here to do this job and i'm doing the best i don't know how and the enemy is routed and they're out in here if i let the sun go down they'll get together and cause me more trouble so stand still hang there hey man for 24 hours now if the world's turning it holds it up and the sun stays in the place and it don't run what happened then that's right now you make yourself a infidel if you say this and then if you don't you shouldn't full of science because they said the world stop and drop so now if you say god's word's not right then you're there for them yeah but it happened that's the main game i don't know the mechanics of it but it happened i don't know the mechanics of the holy ghost but i know it fell on me i can't tell the mechanics of it but i know the blessings of it that's all i i don't know about is the blessing of the holy ghost and it's mechanics keywords so much is secret this boy cannot be healed because the disciples had power jesus gave down power to heal all manner of sickness to cast out devils the cleanse the lepers and to raise the dead he gave that power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them i give you power heaven amen i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in that amen see what i mean yeah but jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen and man he said oh bring in here how long will the suffering he had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing in myself wow he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and it was in him and that giving faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here the scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what god had made him amen and if he did that then can't we rely on what god made us as believers these signs shall follow in that belief he had faith and what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in god the bible says over here you know if our uh if our hearts condemn us then we can have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith right we have confidence towards god if you want to read that found saint john 3 21. i got the scripture written down there my moment then i mean first john 3 21. uh notice if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards god but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards god so you see you can you automatically know that you're wrong you are not going to touch yourself like you're a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a believer and there's nothing between you and god you can ask what you will and know that it will be given because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are and have faith in what the word says you are and jesus had faith in the word of god that said what he was it is written of me didn't david and the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him i have the bread of life that come from god out of heaven amen i am the tree of life from the garden of eden i am all these things i am there i am and he knew that a perfect faith that he was the anointed messiah that the spirit of god was upon him he said now i myself do nothing but it's my faith in god and god presenting the word made manifest and when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest or you are a believer see and a believer is the faith of god that moves in you you like that i like when you all right before the how to what faith really is knowing who he wants without a shadow doubt he knew he was the son of god he knew it for the word identified the word of god identified who he was he said if i do not the worst of my father then don't believe me but if i don't do them works don't believe me but if i do then believe the worst for they are the manifested word prompt amen or if you just wake up to that a minute you see the word itself identify who you are and he said who can condemn this to you know what who can show me that my life and my words don't fulfill exactly what messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was and he had faith to believe that whatever he said it would happen then he turned around and said the works that i do show you also a little while the world says no more yet you shall because i'll be with you even in you take those thought what you shall say for it's not you to speak it's that father that dwells in you he's one doesn't speaking it's not me it's the father the dwelleth in me he doeth the word see what i mean now the identification of a scripture christian these words said jesus these signs shall follow them that belief now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer and deny any of this woman amen you can't do it you're not a believer therefore signs can't follow because you just accept what you want to believe and let the rest of it you want don't believe it but you've got to take the whole thing and believe amen and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs follow them they believe oh could you compare christians today with them christians of long ago how their disciples walk in the power of the spirit moved by the holy ghost to go just a prisoner as i preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and will of god he couldn't even move until god moved him would you like to see a church rise like that it's going to be identifies himself what he was and the same word identifies us if a man loves me he keeps my commandments and if he says he loves me keeps not my commandments that's all of me he's alive amen the truth's not even anything you say well i don't believe well then that you're just not a believer that's all if the bible said so that makes it right amen what the bible says is the truth notice or he said to us if he abide me in my wording you think john 15 you have you abide me see and faith in him give by me and my word abides in you then you ask what you will now see he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when he knows what he was now if he abides me and my word in you then you know who you are yeah amen that's what you will he'll be given to you wouldn't that be a wonderful night if everybody come in that prayer line and say i am a christian i have no condemnation i i know that my heart condemned or not something tells me that tonight's the end of my suffering you're going here with something no matter how much you come in emotion how much you do it won't work until that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you as the substance about when it's there then nothing's going to shake you from it if if you had cancer and the doctor told you yesterday that you'd be dead before monday morning all your heart your respiration is gone the cancers eat you up your bloodstream become completely cancer whatever it is and something comes with this substance of this genuine faith perfect faith was made of substance in you you're laughing at doctor's face you'd be like over eyes you when he walked up and down before the idols and said what you call a little louder maybe it's pursuing he knew what he was going to do because god had told him what was going to happen he said that's the god that answers the fire be god they say we'll take that proposition and they poured water upon the altars and they they've cut themselves they've done everything and called old bailout bail answers elijah is just as calm as he could be he said call aloud that said maybe he's pursuing maybe maybe on a basis maybe it's just something [Music] lord god of abraham isaac and his israel never called him his name jacob scheister he called him israel prince with god lord god of abraham isaac and of that prince jacob let me know in the days that i'm your servant and i've done this not in my desire not at my makeup but at your command i have did this your will you told me what to do you showed me these things to be here now i've poured the water up on the altar i've done all these things according to your commands i'll never be known and when he said that fire fell from the heavens amen he was just as confident as gonna fall because he had the substance why the word said so now this same bible is the same god's word and when you can receive the substance that's perfect faith substance that this promise that god made is yours how do you feel brother bryan when you stand there and you see people come in different languages and things are you afraid no sir no sir he says i've never been afraid yet because he told me and i believe that it's true amen if he told me tonight to go to the presidential graveyard and raise up george washington tomorrow morning i'll invite the whole world come see it done [Applause] [Music] that day brother ran there dead been laying there for a half hour mashed up blood running out of eyes nose and ears his little legs broke up and his little stopping his feet out to the end of the stockings his shoes gone i written i thought that ought to be that boy i said hey let's look in the back of that bible brother lord we got brother lindsay when we look back there and it shall come surpass saith the lord oh my there will be a land worth a lot of evergreen growing rocks will be left together a little boy with a crock hair cut little panty waist buttons up here and his feet your stock is pulled up high you'll have brown eyes they'll be turned back you'll be killed in an automobile accident but you lay your hands up on him and he'll come back to life that was right on there daily just waiting the word i said this boy isn't alive in a couple of minutes now that i'm a false prophet run me out of finland but if he israel hold on your faces and repent amen i said death you can't hold him i'm calling for his hand according to the word of god in the name of jesus christ oh god faith took a hold god said so there it is now that's that's god speaking in this day through vision yeah but this if that vision was contrary to this that would be wrong this is more than division if any vision is contrary to the word leave it alone of god god don't contradict his own word so if this word tells you something and you can have the same confidence then what's gonna happen there's nothing if it says they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover a brother if faith that perfect faith got a hold of that you when you pass by this prayer line you'll be jumping and shouting when you're left here it's over and it's over it's all over it's finished if you had a request in your heart believe that when that prayer was made for that it was going to be answered there isn't nothing is that's what's going to happen like the woman with the blood issue jesus had perfect faith he had it and he come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word if in my words and you my words which this word abides in you then ask what you will it'll be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you've said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and you shall have it it will be given to you time space nothing else will ever change if you know what's done it's already it's already over it now what now and he said to us if you guide me in my word and you think john here you can ask what you will they'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer see you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position is not it written that christ shall come and what all christ would do he said to the obese and then that morning isn't it written in the scriptures that they'll have to that he must suffer and then be killed and raised the third day he said why are you so slow of understanding they thought my this man speaks a little differently mother man come to find out when they got into the end it was him neither her eyes was withholding from him see they know that he kept laying to that scripture and they know it was him now you must believe what you asked for if you are a believer recognize yourself as a believer recognize that these things are for you if there's condensation in your life straighten that first amendment amen see if you've got condemnation you're uh or you might have oral robertson and a dozen more people who have faith to come here and pray over you and jump up and down and pull on you by the gallons it you know it won't move i'm not trying what falls off from aurora's meetings then i'll catch him in the prayer line you're here to say he was prayed for before a man with dark hair kind of big fella big jaws or roberts and that was at a certain city called certain certainty yes that's right see he was prayed for by such and such a man see that again but your years your troubles go make that thing right go out there and confess that sin to your husband to your wife don't do this thing it'll never do you any good no matter who you're praying for so they make that right condemnations in your heart and god will not come into that heart condemn god don't dwell in that you've got to make it right then when you do you must have faith if everything's right you must have faith and believe it don't be afraid in the book of job that said here job fear and what he feared it actually happened right what brought it is fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from us but his fear brought him brother to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now if he knows it wouldn't happen it wouldn't happen you know what i mean if you're afraid when you come to the prayer line maybe i just haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry but if you know what's going to happen it'll happen see it's a substance or something job had a fear that these things have come up on him and they did if you have a fear that your disease is going to leave you or won't leave it it won't if you have a faith that it will you ask any medical doctor the first thing he'll try to get you to do is have confidence in the medicine he's given if you haven't got no confidence in it you better leave it alone right sure what is it that's it's faith it doesn't heal amen his faith all the time peter he was doing all right so he got scared the word told him he could walk on the water he's scared first his daughter was a ghost and he said lord if it did you bit me comfy on the water he said come on no that's just the same as james 5 14. then in march 16th the same god said to come on and so it started walking down all right got in and out of the ship started walking off there's a storm on you know great white cap waves bigger these hills around here a foam breaking on top of them terrific maybe 15 20 feet foam white caps breaking that was a terrific thing for him to ask if it be you large see it looks like a they look like a shadow or a spirit he said if it's you fit me come to me on the water jesus said come on and he stepped down since the lord i just want but when he got his eyes on the wave he got scared what time in his mind first thing he was going to walk because the word said for me to walk and the next thing he looked at is um well he looked at his symptoms looked out there and seen how big that way he was and he got scared and when he did down he went see why do you fear it happened why do you believe him when he believed he could walk you off when he believed got scared in his belief then his substance left him see he still professed his face but he didn't have the substance right on top of that white captain what do i don't tell you if he had this perfect face anybody didn't have it he thought he did he did it first he's willing to venture right out why the lord told me to do it it's got to happen so he just stepped right down the board they saw him yeah man he never thought about the the the ways how contrary there was he never got that in his mind and when you get to thinking well now wait you know i've been sick so long stop you're just not going to go back to the vote but when you quit thinking about that abraham considered is not his own body nowadays neither the dead is the stanford he didn't think about that he didn't consider it it wasn't even brought into understanding he didn't even consider it all he just considered what god said and he went on as long as peter did that he was but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lives in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which you are if we live in a perfect faith of a christian what we are we're very mystic to the world yeah the people wouldn't understand you just walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you not do then the people get to say there will be a mystic person to them that's the way it is all believers there are mystics that people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand when he spoke to them they say this and they say well if you talk and riddles we don't understand this how can this be see it wasn't in the world that he lived in they couldn't understand it nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith on each substance base he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material hey you're getting into raption condition now that means for each one of us americans not just the pastors deacons trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world god alone your baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says is not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you say hold on now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never failed yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are mystic to others we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from now to resist just just simply turn down just resisting that is just walk away from him god said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him yeah your ears are against anything else but what the spirits say he that has an ear that listens see what the spirit says unto the churches the ones got the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches see what satan says well now this camp that don't have nothing well if you teach that the denomination that's going to have nothing to do with it it goes right on just a thing he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches you know when the bible's always confronting us to him that has faith that he that has an ear to hear let him hear he that has with the lady counselor numbers of the beast all these different things he that let him tell it to the rest of them that they might have and that's about faith we're talking about now faith that you've got to have that perfect faith that faith that says yes there's nothing to say no when god says yes see but he says yes yes yes nothing else can ever take it from me with his perfect faith he was very strange and the devil didn't stay around him very long we got it lester this morning when he come with that great big a fluffle of intellectual conception he fluffled up against jesus said when he kindly found out he hit a ten thousand vote wine and brought him right back again yes sir he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone you are shocked become a little softer the next time one said are you a great man you yourself up here to be somebody to get behind me oh my what he meant now shall not tempt the lord thy god see he proved himself on to satan that he was the lord god amen or it is written thou shall not tempt now if satan didn't know that that was the lord god he said wait a minute you're not that person but he knows better than to the benefit do you know what ground to stand on he says thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and that's who he was amen and satan knows better than to say that because jesus works and already proved that he was the lord thy god notice now another perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it and i just watch when you believe anything do anything and you've got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances that don't have one thing to do with it it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and a large reveal that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and belong oh it does that just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going it masters all circumstances amen well if you do this uh sword sword sort of that thing that already got it mastered faith please that god will work it out i don't know how to do it but to do it anyhow it masters all circumstances and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love yeah faith and love works together you're just like a young couple you take a young man young woman and they fall in love with one another and as they go along and begin to know one another more their hearts just begin to beat is one see they're yet they're not husband wife but their love binds them together and they have confidence in one another now if they really love one another really love and you know that this girl loves you and and she knows that you love her you've got confidence faith in one another right you got faith in one if you didn't you better not marry me notice you gotta have faith and you separate them about one extreme south one extreme north they still that love beachbody no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another and if you love the law it's not trying to dodge hell but you love the law then you have faith in god if you love him like a a young girl just happened here in louisville not all a woman she was uh she's been a christian for many years but her husband had just fell in love she fell over this man he had been a christian a couple years and so they got married they loved and had confidence in one another and they got married and so the woman said to the man says hubby it must be hard on you you're just a young christian you've had so much to go through with drinking what it was said you've had so much to go through with and said i know you're about to be tempted awfully hard and said i want you to know one thing now now if you happen to fall if you happen to to fall into temptation and as overcome don't stay away from home you come on back you come right here because i'm gonna be right here waiting for you and i'm gonna help you praise you again until you get victory i'm going to stay with you because when i married you i married you because i loved you no matter what you are i still love you you know after that he was eating his lunch with the fellows down in the boring room he was telling them about so now how could a man ever do anything wrong when somebody knows you like me there you are how how could you trespass that confidence and when we were sinners alienated without god in the world and that muck of mothers have talked about this morning god come to us amen god sought you you never saw god no man can come to me except the father draws you first and god came down in that luck what you were and sought you out and brought you out about the creator of perfect love look what you are and look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you there real genuine love of creative confidence in his word he caught me when i was nothing i'm still nothing but i'm in his hands he called me and he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when he was unlovable but he changed you yeah it's like the colored sister said that time in her testimony she said i'm not what i ought to be and i'm not what i want to be and then i'm not what i used to be she knows she'd come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if god when i was an alien from him so well because he stood down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he sees something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people don't save today look at the minions he could have tucked beside you but he took you amen lord to take your place amen your enough economy amen no one can do it that's his love to you that won't your love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is his circumstances is governed by this love and creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings to faith all right then it can't it can't keep from uh bringing out just exactly what god promised it would do now watch perfect faith is pure just as pure as love here see now when you love somebody and you got you love your husband or you love your wife now there's no need of anybody telling you you don't do it because you do do it and you know you do it now if i ask you how can you you prove you do it well i'll prove it by the way i'll answer it see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal honest husband and that proves to me that i and i love my wife or i love my husband see life proves what you are the same thing christianity does amen see your faith you have confidence in one another is pure and it's something real that you can't show it to somebody else yet you got it and your actions proven and when you got pure unadulterated faith like your love is to your companions then you prove it by the way you act amen you ain't complaining no more you know it's done you just walk along no matter what the thing looks like what anybody else says you know what's happening you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband as well as you know you lost see love and faith has to go together they're kin folks they love love produces faith when satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word like jesus did the word of god is perfect we'll have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist faith i will hurry just as quickly as you can but his faith is in his word conquer we can conquer anything both death health and the grace we know that god is god that perfect faith in god's perfect word he conquered everything that he come in contact with death cannot even stand in his presence sickness cannot stand in his presence flowing from him is like rivers of virtue going out constantly virtue going from his garments these people laid in his shadow step put their finger on his garments on the tv when that woman down there then everybody wanted to touch his garment because they seen that there was virtue going from the conflict though like rivers there he was walking walking in a world with a perfect face faith because he was the word and now if he abides me through him he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of way virtues flowing from him the rivers of god's fountains of blessings destroying out to the people see what i mean and you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it it's actually taking place and you see it if you just imagine that don't do any good but if it's really there it really happened now notice see by when he stood and he said if you destroy this body this temple i'll raise it up again in three days why he was just as satisfied he'd do that because the scripture said that he won't do it the messiah i'll not leave his soul in hell now i suffered my holy one to see corruption a prophet who the word comes to has said that would happen and he knows he was that person yeah and when though jesus himself said the prayer of faith shall save the sick or they shall lay hands over sick and they shall recover if he would have the same perfect confidence that my hands are they know me i shall recover ever because he said so he said you destroy this body and i'll raise it up because he know he was messiah i'm not suffering my holy one to see corruption he knew that he was the only one neither only he saw in hell he hit him he knowed he'd do it he had confidence that he was that uncomfortable death in hell said destroy it if you wish to i'll raise it back again in three days oh my i have power to lay my life down or i have power to take it up again he knows who he was you're a christian you have rights to any redemptive blessing that jesus died for you it's all yours it's already paid for you just have to believe it not imagine it but believe it and know that it's yours and you can be deceptive oh that's a conquering faith no uh do you do it what happened before he could predict that it would happen because he knowed it would happen and whatever he predicted come to pass now watch whatever he says god honored what he said think of that whatever jesus said god brought it to pass so you know his words were god's word now look that same scripture comes right back into us again if he stayed to this mountain oh my i just let that focus on the list because we're going to have a prayer but this missed the congregation to pray for this thing the ones that want to have to go look he knew that he pleased god he knew that there was nothing on his life god had already testified this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased you're him this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell in at the day of his baptism i'm pleased to make my abode in here there's no condemnation to him at all now when the same god comes to you as pleased to dwell in you please to honor your word what your decision is what was joshua's decision stand still son and it stood there amen amen sure what was moses decision how did he stick over the river like that and call for its opening open see whatever you ask and if you stay to this mountain be moved and don't doubt see in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you say that put you back in the word now that's not skim milk it puts you back i know it's going to jump shot over top of you because you can't answer but real genuine face catches that right now i've seen it friends there's this bible laying open before me i've seen it happen and i know it's the truth i know god in heaven or that i might not live through to finish this message but i know that it happened i've seen it myself i'm a witness of that word being fulfilled and i know it is the truth amen stand and stand there and see the creator bring a living creature into existence right in presence of your eyes you shake your head in one and then look around and see him bring another one just exactly like it because you said so and turn over here and say there will be another one there and look and there it is yeah now that's the truth oh where should we be there's perfect faith no vision just speak the word never saw the squirrels he just said the scripture what it was and speaking and don't doubt it but what you say it will be there and uh took god at his word and it was bad am i right that's just as powerful as friends as your pastor that's just as powerful as it was when joshua stopped the sun amen because the sun was already there the elements was moving and he stopped the movement but then he brought something there after i've been planted in the grain oh my god there it is my faith looks up to thee thou lamb of calvary amen if you say and don't doubt but believe that what you said you shall have what you said he believed as it happened david in the psalm spoke of him and with it he took his power and he ministered to others not only did he keep it to himself but he ministered to others by also saved others even to the uttermost and he can do the same thing now and promise the same faith to the believers in his word in john john 14 12. he said so mark 16 and also in mark 11 23 we just read now why now he has appeared to us in the same form that he did to them in the old testament and in the same as it is in the new testament and assured by the same word the same christ and i declare to you that christ is the holy ghost the word christ means the anointed one just the person that's anointed that is the crown the anointed one how many knows that's true that's good the anointing one there would be a man that would be anointed anointed with what the bible said in acts 2 that jesus of nazareth a man approved of god anointed with the holy ghost went about us and done great works tonight and god manifested through that he was in this man and now we become anointed with that same spirit anointed messiah messiahs of the last days to shine forth the resurrection of jesus christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the holy ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one already and the same sign promised by the same god in the same word is making this same manifestation there's nothing left for us to do but believe it i believe it is a substance amen and that creates a perfect faith amen just think how how numb we are just think of that just a minute now let's see has he done all things well has he ever told us anything about what happened just exactly the way he said hasn't he performed and has a great pillar of fire been among us and done just exactly like he promised to do haven't we seen it have side statement haven't been predicted what would happen go right there and have it even in the papers and magazines pack it right back and show it once told you months before it happens has it done just exactly the way he did in the old testament in the new testament just exactly the same one amen the same holy spirit comes as desire and the word of god which is quicker and sharper than a two-day sword a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart isn't that right is that the same god how about singing wrong it's not a stranger off somewhere else each year he sure does this to create a perfect faith our feelings right now i know that his spirit is here i know that he knows all things amen and i know he's forced to do something he's been doing something to create this perfection of faith in the people yeah are we going to walk into eternity like it was in the days of noah are they so safe are we going to come like lot but three out of sodom or we go to comrade in the days of john the baptist with six believers let us believe now for his worst is perfect that are manifested daily and perfectly before us showing that he is the word the worst hebrews the fourth chapter says the word of god is sharper than any two-aged source of uh even a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart think of that the word of god is that a discerner of the intent of the heart for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-day sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and our spirit and other joints and other mires and is a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word made flesh hallelujah a word operating in human flesh by physical science by material science by scriptural [Music] the devil has put everything in the world before he tried to make you keep you from believing you're bringing the meeting and trying to throw everything you can in front of you shake your eyes from him the bible says rise and shake yourself pinch yourself his spirit is here he knows you you've got one thing to do and that's to believe it you accept it you know you bleed out he knows what you are he knows what you're [Music] praise the desiring hallelujah brother we're challenged to have perfect faith if there's anything god's looking for now is perfect faith is it possible well what
