leadership in their lives so in with us we pray Lord's grace grace grace and the going forth of your word grace Lord in the receiving of the word amen to recognize the Lord that is for them father personally it is for us grace to let go and that you have your way in revealing the word grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen No all things yes they're possible amen hallelujah the

hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah thank you praise the name of the Lord God bless turn with me to Genesis chapter 2 and again as the Lord leads to try to bring more thoughts concerning leadership to make our calling and election sure to make sure that we have a spiritual and spiritually inspired leadership by the Holy Ghost not just an uninspired or religious by the Satan's anointing but by God's a 19a men to believe that God is in control of the leadership in your life amen not my will then be done that's a tremendous statement a man to make what is the will of God for your everyday living amen grace to us in Genesis chapter to find the leadership of God in Genesis again to get the revelation of those that had his leadership and those that came under Satan's leadership amen and that's why we're here today a man doing what we're doing that's why we're trying to live that life and give control to Jesus because in the beginning there was one of them they gave control to the devil a man so the grace of God to us that we have that right leadership and in Genesis 2 and beginning to read at verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight good for food The Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden the tree of knowledge of good and evil a man but God put it there for a reason and verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat amen but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it they mad as it was then so it is now there are those things that God wants us to eat but then there are other things that God doesn't want us to touch a man and it is a tree of knowledge of good and evil a man and just think of it that it's going to be so close to the real that if a if possible would deceive the very elect so the grace of God brother that the tree of knowledge of good and evil today around the message is not going to deceive you a man but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it but I turn it is the greater majority of so-called believers a day are partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen so grace to give us eyes to see ears to hear the truth they met and grace to give us the revelation what leadership we're underneath under a man is a God's leadership the God of creation or is the god of this world the devil god have mercy on us but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it oh but it's good and evil we'll just eat the good but you're not gonna leave the evil that's the deception for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die die physically now they're gonna die spiritually god bless his words you may be seated just some thoughts if we go to another scripture in Genesis 3 but just to bring greetings from our brother car in New Brunswick and our brother car is as brother market for me turn 90 the like this week and but somebody told me somebody asked him what does it like to be 90s I don't know and and I believe it because he didn't when I spoke to him on the phone he certainly did it sound like someone 90 years old not sound like a teenager and and my brother is that his words and and now he talks and his actions are the same he's still a young man I said well brother you're not you're not ninety or nine you're just nine years old so I said I believe that I said you sound like it and so on so I pray God continue to bless our brother as he ministers at 90 years old a man and he was 89 I believe was in in brother in the assembly and Grand Falls new beer old assembly our brother Minister there might have been 88 I guess or 89 and he just came down here just to visit Newfoundland and just take a tourist trip and so on but the Brethren got him to minister in central and it's not to believe that that that he was the he was that close to 90 even then of course because he had his notes but he he's a brother he said I left the notes and he began to walk around the aisles and so on I said well god bless him a man so to God be the glory and God continue to bless our brother cars ministry and know that he's not just ministering in New Brunswick he's also doing traveling oh yeah I spoke to him about two or three weeks ago and him and his wife sister car she's young and also is son-in-law of brother Carmen they traveled somewhere in other countries yeah and they were gone for about almost I guess two weeks before they came back to New Brunswick again so God God's grace to our brother car as he keeps ministry maybe he's gonna be the one of the few older folks that's gonna be here for the rapture a man and if he continues on the way he's going he could be here if the Lord tarries until he's hobbling hey man so thank God but he's there to bear witness of the truth so grace and greetings from our brother car and from the Saints there and also our greetings from our brother stride and praying grace to our brother stride he said that he had a rough time so far because apparently he fell down this past summer and of course being in his age right now he's in his 80s and being that old of course it affected his body and he still still dealing with it so the grace of God be with our brother stride in not carnival where is he Phillips head yeah I trust this st. Phillip amen so god bless our brothers strike and also to again to I believed our brother mentioned in prayer and that's to pray for Sharon our daughter who has surgery tomorrow morning at 10:15 so the grace of God be with her through that surgery and just a reminder that during Easter that brother Carmon Mills will be ministering for us Easter but he can only come he will arrive on Friday and he will even again on Sunday because he's got some commitments and not only he can only come here Friday because that that week he will be in the United States and he won't get back to New Brunswick until Thursday you get back there Thursday so he said brother be able to get two new flan until Friday so I said brother we'll have you administer for us good Friday Saturday and Sunday and and he's got it he's gonna be added to fly back to New Brunswick Sunday evening a man because his commitments so the god bless our brother Carmen as he comes to minister to us for three services during the Easter a man also to remind you concerning the storms we've had I was somewhat surprised concerning a report that I heard that that if we went around the world the storm that we had here and what we were dealing with here in the eastern new food land and it apparently had affected the thoughts of the world and because of what was going on here and to them again scientists of course are recognizing it as the climate change science knows that something is going on up there in the universe they know that and I trust that you and I got that revelation too and that understanding but don't take it lately you can look up don't look up for that look up for glory a man the kingdom of God and I don't know if you noticed it or not but during the reports on the of the storm that we had here and all the snow that we've had and so on that they refer to it as Snowmageddon I trust you understand that where that come from was Armageddon and that's why they called it Snowmageddon brothers just think the world is recognizing these things that you and I ought to have the revelation of four years the Battle of Armageddon and that's what that's what they are that's what they are comparing this past winter with the Battle of Armageddon Wyatt brother the real battle of Armageddon is coming before the nation's but brother now they're saying that we're dealing with it because of our weather rather we're closer to the end than we think it's over we better get more serious with what we believe a man we get it more serious with the promise concerning the resurrection how serious are you but it is just too many that are more serious with their families and caught up with their natural family whether they're certainly not caught up with the with the word and I caught up with their spiritual families no no so I pray grace that we're going to if we got the Holy Ghost of course we will be caught up with our spiritual family in prayer concerned and so on why because of the hour that we're living well this when we see this happening in our storms and so on brother sister we'd better look up get out of here amen they're recognizing the change in the world I trust we're recognizing his change not not just naturally but spiritually see it's having spiritual leadership not natural leadership if it's natural leadership and oh well I'm a mess I'm a believer so you and you'll go on and still keep me living the life you want to live kills to do what you want to do when you want to do it how you want to do it where you want to do it no it's got to be God in control a man trusts him by grace that it was the leadership of God for where our our sisters here from the United States that ended up to married to Newfoundlanders and so on and to move here raised there's a family here and so on so the grace of God be with them that that was God leadership in their lives a man to God be the glory amen so brother we need to get more and more spiritual by the grace of God amen so let's let's consider yes Snowmageddon but we're not gonna look for more snow we're looking for the Battle of Armageddon now and then who over over used Snowmageddon that's what was in their mind was the Battle of Armageddon and they feel oh the Bible says this the Bible says that about Armageddon oh this is what we're experiencing in the in the natural a man so grace to us is my prayer and God bless sister Kimberly and and the baby Michael and she's I guess they're home today and also sister Kimberly statistically splittin family a man so god bless them amen so well we're looking for a change well it's always started brother Paul's like a man he's experiencing a change a definite change and you want to know what it's like ask ask your other brothers or ask your mother or father ask your aunts and uncles they can tell you what it's like a man it's the change so the god bless our brother Paul and sister Kimberly and Michael a male so God be with us oh yes and of course brother Bob I would say I mentioned in prayer and that's remember our brother Ron Spencer amen the grace of God - brother Ron amen Lord blesses turn with me to Genesis chapter 3 Genesis chapter 3 I want to share with you again subscriptions concerning leadership and also some quotes and it's amazing again that I have highlighted by the round ministry on leadership in December the 7th shortly before the Lord called of all but to highlight also some other very significant messages that the Lord laid on his heart to minister and again it was the invisible union of the bride and again November 1965 and Christ is revealed in his own word August 1965 but I discovered some other messages as well the anointing was at the end time of course and god of this evil age they man and another one right here is Satan's Eden it's a warning to the bride it's a warning to the believers of what we're going to be dealing with before the resurrection and before the rapture we're going to be dealing with the god of this world were of this evil age and we're going to be dealing with it in Satan's eaten so I pray the grace of God that we're not going to be eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and again it said there's a warning there that it's really not of good and evil in these last days is going to be so close to the real it would deceive the very elect if possible oh yeah it's going to it's got you the tree of knowledge of good and evil is gonna be testifying or what testifying of the entire message testifying of the prophet tends to find of that oh yeah and that's like you'll be kept you got to be careful what you're looking at on online and on the internet most definitely because brother it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil don't because only that brother is a message preacher that was the message preacher makes no difference brother will come when it comes to message preachers brother the God had to deal with that in the in Genesis and Abel had to deal with the Cain had to deal with it and it comes on down so no doubt no and Enoch had to deal with it Noah had to deal with it and it comes on down through the prophets and so on and there's are many other examples that I could give you when it comes to leadership you're either under the leadership of God or you're under the leadership of Satan and again if you're you can be under the leadership of God stay with the word stay simple stay humble under the leadership of the devil a man oh yeah you're going to preach the message but again so close to a deceive the elect and we are warned Paul warned it before he's going I'll be may be Peter warned to say before the Lord took him home and brother again the problem of God has warned us in these last days and Jesus also warned us concerning deception and brother that's the Satan has been there since the Garden of Eden and brother he's still there in Satan's eating a man has gone from God's Eden to Satan's Eden a man and God is going to take his elect and his sons and daughters and his right out of here a man and brother well when God creates a New Eden as it were is doing there's gonna be no sin there's going to be no tree of knowledge of good and evil it's gonna be perfect by the grace of Almighty God so God Elvis brother again I ministered at on a certain message some time ago and it might have been god of this evil age and then I finished by asking you these questions and that is who are you are you Adam with Adams attitude Adams leadership are you Eve yeah so are you able or are you Kane well yeah Kane talk to God Kane I fellowship with God yeah okay a fellow sir was able and it killed him yeah so are you able or you Kane if you're guilty of killing somebody killing there's their spirit or attitude Kelly they're there their motives under objectives Kelly they're in their nature a man but there can be you can have the spirit of Cain let's make sure we don't have the spirit that Yvette to make sure we don't have the spirit that Cain had a man so are we Enoch or Noah both thumbs grace with God they may it but he Locke was raptured Noah went through the flood a man and I really am are we locked whose spirit do you have whose attitude do you have the attitude of Abraham or the attitude of lot and again it is Jacob and Esau do we have jingo spirit or a soul spirit oh yeah and yet Jacob was our Esau brother was entitled to the birthright but yet his spirit and his attitude wasn't right his motive an objective was right the reason they why he wanted it wasn't right a man so he was under he was under a false leadership and but Jacob oh he wanted that knowing knowing the significance of it knowing what it meant he wanted that birthright same thing with the Bride of Christ we want the birthright a man and it said Joseph are you Joseph or his elder brothers that betrayed him there are a lot of believers that are Joseph's elder brothers because they betrayed a lot of believers oh yeah now you Moses are you days and Cora will read that about them in a moment so I trust God the grace of God where Moses we're not dating we're not Korah no because the Bible warns us in the last days now yeah there's this these are going to be deceived that's going to be to see why because they got Dayton's spirit and chorus spirit and there's ministering Brethren with those spirits and deceiving the people and it says are you Jesus or are you Judas oh yeah there's nowhere that Judas stood out in the word as the disciple that he was false and he was dis and he was cruel and so on no no that didn't come out until until Jesus Camus was going to enter the third pole of his ministry then what was in Judas began to come out and what's in the believers today is coming out caught Elvis see it's more serious than what we think we just want a preacher to come and preach an old make us happy and oh we're glory hallelujah praise the Lord amen yeah the devil can do that and then blind people to the fact that they're under a deceiving spirit and I was thinking about it yesterday last night and I woke seven o'clock this morning and I couldn't go to sleep again it's just I couldn't get it get away from that anointing concerning leadership you know it's been on my thoughts I asked the Lord God help us and brother if you got a position in the church a position of leadership make sure you're calling an election is sure definitely so I urge you Jesus or Judas well Judas went on he was numbered with those that went out and prayed for the sick raise the dead healed the sick yeah Jesus anointed them and they come back as oh we did this we did that they didn't say Judas was separate none of the other disciples mentioned Judas saying he was this and he was that no the other side mentioned he's he negative of Jesus only when he betrayed Jesus or bro Judas rather only when he betrayed Jesus god help us as I said Jesus had more trouble with Peter than you did with Judas because Peter was constantly questioning God Peter was constantly stopping this don't do this don't do that the father Jesus said get that behind me Satan yeah repeat he was referring to the spirit that was influencing Peter was he under Jesus leadership or Peters leadership oh Jesus constantly asked him after resurrection lovest thou me more than these lovest thou me more than these oh yeah Peter was referring to human love Jesus did use human love but then he referred to define law my copy amen now figlio no divine love that's what God's looking for in you and me amen praise the name of the Lord brother I told you feel your love is one thing but I tell you a couple love is another amen what does couple love or old mine you lay down your life for your brothers and sisters as Christ lay down his life for us what motivated him divine love amen he loved us is there anything in you that he loves is there something there about you that that Jesus loves who did he laid his life down for who did he die for was it you then he loved you and he's looking to restore you and he's looking to do to become United with you in an invisible union of the heavenly bride bridegroom and the earthly bride god help us so are you Jesus or Judas many are Judas to betray the word of course you've betrayed the word with a kiss yeah oh my god grace to us that we be not deceived hey man that's right so are we wise virgins why are we foolish virgins oh yeah virgins but you're either wise or you're foolish are you wise believers or foolish believers some are foolish yeah and the problem of God did highlight he said now he said the wise and the foolish virgins remember he said they're all virgins you know but he said there's wise get wisdom but get understanding the Bible say it concerning what God has done what God is doing we need the wisdom of God the leadership of God and brother God leads us with anything as his wisdom hey man and he'll lead us with his understanding praise the Lord sure you ride why is virgin are you the foolish virgin are you sheep or goats are you believers non-believers make believers again for challenge that there are three kinds of believers in every Church that's what the problem of God said they're unbelievers there's make believers and there's believers but the believers got no question it stays with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth hey man and it's not your will it's his will you're not interested in what you want to do you want to you're interested in what he wants to do in you and through you hey man not my will father die and be done amen he got that control of your life that you're conscious of him you're totally under his control and no matter what's going on in your life through the day lord I need your help here lord I need your wisdom here lord I need you I need some leadership here Lord please help me Lord that so that what I'm doing it's according to your will not my will amen I don't care whether senior you're in your home with us in your job in your in your work whether in your education your school or university a man it's the will of God amen again like I said concerning with places that I worked and they they always you wanted to know what I thought why oh well you do it differently I did I was just doing it to do by the nature that God had given me but they were doing it by their worldly nature they were born with it yeah I was born again with it with another nature no birth is to change our nature hey man Lord bless the food for the nourishment of our natural body the Lord I pray you bless us a fetus with the word to nourish our spiritual bodies a man to make us what more and more new creatures in Christ oh yeah praise the name of the Lord sir brother god help us that we're gonna make sure that we have his leadership is not Satan leadership going by our feelings but no it's called leadership going by our faith amen but again there's too many that are controlled by their feelings but not faith a man why do you do this well does the world want me to do it I feel I had that revelation in my heart I'm just doing what God wants me to do amen you're so under control in your life no matter what you're doing what you're thinking it's all him amen you're under his leadership to the extent that he's the one that's in control and he's the one that's there that's leading you amen brother Brown preach leadership I don't know if you're aware of it he preached it again or before he preached it here in Indiana it is the same or rather in another church there he preached it in Prescott Arizona leadership what was it it was a message to young people he was preaching to young people young brothers and sisters yeah why to encourage them to make their calling an election sure by making sure that they have the right leadership in their lives and that's where he highlights the fact you know that when you're born and you're under this leadership you under that leadership you're on the moms leadership you're under dad's leadership and then you under the teachers leadership but he said what leadership are you under now a man and he's bringing that to the attention of the of the young people to let him know that there's a leader in their lives a man and they need to make sure that it's it's Christ and in that message to the young people he said you've got a you've got a face one thing and he said eternal life and there's only one person who can give it give that to you he said mama can't give it to you pop okay give it to you your pastor can give it to you you're the leader can't give it to you he said everybody that gets eternal life as to come to Jesus Christ he is the only one who can give that part eternal life he said your teacher can give you education and teach you and you have to learn it your mother can teach you to walk and you had to learn to walk your faith father can teach you how to be a businessman and what you have to learn but he said only Jesus can give you eternal life oh yeah he said your priest your leader or so forth can teach you your religion and you can learn the message that we are trying to teach yeah you can learn that but the message but who's in control of your life amen why are you here today because you decided to come or was it the leadership of the Holy Ghost Christ in you and he said you can learn the message that we are trying to teach you can learn it oh yeah but still he said that one give you eternal life he said you got to accept the person Jesus Christ you got to know him not know about him and he says you understand that he said all of you he said got to accept the person Jesus Christ to have eternal life now and he said but sometimes other leadership in your life other leadership sin your life get so much influence on us till we don't know what to do when that time comes so what's influencing you today and I said what a fatal thing what a fatal thing it is to reject the leadership to eternal life amen brother is not just we're not looking for leadership Oh leadership to this revelation that revelation that revelation we're looking for leadership to the faith of the resurrection and the rapture that's eternal life that's Christ amen he said I am the resurrection believe us now this a man god help us to believe not to doubt and and again not make sure you're eating you the tree of life not the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen the tree of eternal life but there's too many believers that are still eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen oh no that's not messiest yes it's in the message it's right there and many are many as he end that brother that I was talking to on the phone a little while ago and he was interested in the message and he had met a believer but there were certain things about that believer that he questioned and I saw I understand you I said Jesus said the same problem I said the prophets have the same problem the ministry said the same problem as you're dealing with believers make believers non-believers oh yes he said that's right that's right he just felt that the word was right but something to do with that spirit of that brother wasn't right what he discerned the Spirit of Christ in you or just a religious spirit Amen sister that's right I've discerned sometimes the religious spirit in believers yeah but not the Spirit of Christ why they were in control of the religion but Christ wasn't in control of them that's the truth a lot of believers are in control the message and then they allow this they allow that they lots of Mel well I can't do this because that you know I read the message I've read the message yeah but where's that where's the light that is totally separated unto the Lord amen and you're not living for yourself you're living for Jesus amen so that your pity your children can see Christ in you hey well that's not just mom that's just not dead just not my grandma and grandpa no what do they see they see it something more in control of you the way you act the way you talk and how you counsel them and how you're encouraging them and so on hey man if Christ is in you your your yes your spiritual they'll recognize that in your life but it was just too many that are not spiritual just when they get in church and again they're not spiritual they're religious because of your spiritual it's in you now it's in you outside the door it's in you in your home it's in you no matter where you are even when you're working Alleluia its Christ in you anybody in crisis governing you oh this is serious we better make our calling and election sure make sure that we the right leadership a man so it's a man it's not not the devil no no the false scent of Christ is the true head of Christ that's leading me the Triad a crisis controlling me my thoughts my words my deeds my mother sent objects is what I want to do again when we're and out rather you repeating a lot of things yes because Peter said I got to repeat it because you're forgetful ears and he said I need to okay I used to know what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep bringing this to your remembrance a man god help us Genesis 3 here with me amen in Genesis 3 and verse 7 no sorry verse 1 now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman he got her attention yay and God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and remember he wasn't a snake in the tree of knowledge of good and evil I seen pictures of but what they thought you know or a tree of knowledge good and evil and they had a serpent a snake in the tree and he was going to talk to Eve no he was an operator creature like a man yeah he was so close to man that they would mix yeah but when God cursed him all his legs come off his arms come off and he went down like a snake yeah that was the curse this thing caught for that understanding brother sister and we're dealing with the serpent even in this hour but the Bible tells us that even his angels are ministers even his angels have positions of leadership in the church Satan is not worried about out there they're born and seen a man with a sinful nature Satanist is after those who are looking to God and he wants to deceive them a man that's right brother so he was more subtil as he was then so he is now than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay and God said he quoted the word like people quote the message they quote the word they quote the word and then they'll add a word or they will take away word god help us yes God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die remember was Satan's going to deceive us he's gonna he's going to do it on the basis of the word with the word a man with the word all people think Satan's gonna deceive me and get me to do this get me to do that no he's gonna get you to believe this and believe this and believe that he's focusing on what you believe he knows faith comes by hearing the word he knows so he's not gonna go there and do that to deceive you he's gonna be right he's gonna take what you're certain we were professing to believe and deceive you yeah you know take it and he misinterpreted you'll add to it you take away from it but again notice this again I keep reminding you that's gonna be so close it would deceive the very elect impossible grace that you're not deceived into doing what you're doing contrary to the will of God don't be deceived to do what you want to do no no Satan to do that well you believe the message you believe that yeah if God said yes God said yeah yeah okay a man a man a man and he was saying amen to what the serpent said amen that's what God said yeah if God said but he added a word to it so rather when when when you're dealing with the devil he'll quote the word he'll quote the message yeah yes God said but don't worry about that don't worry about this it's alright everything's fine you're good yeah I keep reminding you of what my father used to say two kinds of good he constantly reminded us of that his children he says you either good or good for nothing so he said what are you yeah he was challenging our faith let's be good for something this should be good for God hey man and there's none good but one praise the Lord as I said about that couple we met in a store there a few days ago amazing and we were sort of seemed like two others we were in line there to get checked out in a store and this lady and I was moving around and moving back and she spoke to something and she bought it oh my she said what a world were living in she says her and she said oh we don't have to worry with this natural foods natural this natural that she said every we bit we're blessed but she said people don't want to mind they don't mind talking about there's time with that but she said they don't want talking about Jesus I said I struck me I said that's right I said you're right I said they don't want Jesus they want this they want that but they don't want Jesus and when we discovered that she was a Christian I was a Christian whoa and her husband was there oh she said what church do you attend and I told her whoa we might be there sometime good she said because she said we go to this church over here just the one there on the corner of topsail Road and Paradise Road yeah I said well you go there yes she said yeah Oh ice appraised the Lord God bless you Oh wonderful to meet you stand when she saw sister Betty she went over and knocked her and put her arms around her and I said well Lord I said praise the Lord I said your will be done amen so the will of God be done that she said well we might come out that way sometimes she said and drop into your service well it got the Lord blessing ain't man she they were all mine she was right there to talk with the Lord hey man she was right there to bring Jesus into it Oh everything was busy busy busy I guess everybody was afraid that we're gonna have another storm and this was going happened that was going to happen so they were there to get these groceries these groceries and so on and when she should we leave it with the Lord she said EEPROM I said yes I said Lord will provide yes she says he's certain certainly will a man I said god bless her faith Lord a man her brother I trust a man she's following Jesus leadership oh yes she was she was he I prayed god bless her a man and again this be on our guard and verse three but of the fruit of the tree of life fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it hmm solar separation don't eat it don't touch it just say I just want to look at it no don't touch it see yes God God requires that separation see it's like it's like when that brother we need two brother rounds office and he had a certain book there by a certain evangelist and he said brother I look at this yeah I said okay and he laid it on brother Browns Bible and went out and left and the angel said take that away don't put that on too on the work yeah and brother Brown removed it from the Bible and laid it aside yeah because it was false teaching and again another time when brother Manuel was there in being Jeffersonville many years ago maybe 1968 and he was in a brother's home and it was it was his wife the sister she was there she was the one to use to make brother branham's pot cherry pies that he liked and she was make pies for brother ran and so on and so they were sitting there in his home having fellowship when just all of a sudden the brother got up on the chair he moved over to where brother Manuel was and he reached to the end table there and there was there was a pan or something laid on the Bible and he took at me later the side took it off the Bible always said brother he said brother Brown would never never put anything on his Bible nothing and so he said I always keep my Bible clear oh I so that's good praise the Lord a man and I got the picture of that brother and his wife and and and a son a man don't thank God for their testimony brother you shall eat of it neither we shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she died we want to compromise a little here compromise there sometimes this family or friends or neighbors no don't compromise for them no no you take your stand and and if they got a right spirit they'll appreciate it oh yes they will it's like like I'd like with our neighbors oh yeah they've really appreciated your your spirit and your attitude we know you're doing things right so we've got no worries with this no worries with that and so on oh yeah and again one of our neighbors are saying where we moved at a paradise all my shoes I miss you I miss you you being living over there yeah grace of God to us grace of God to them but listen Saints let's have is leadership in our lives not my will that I am be done amen and the servants said unto the woman see he was pretty was the first evangelist he was first preacher yeah and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil Oh know this and know that listen just know what you want to know know what you need to know not what you want to know amen if you're under God's leadership he's going to reveal to you what you need to do here you'll give you what you need anyway oh the devil's there to give you this to give you that make it bigger make it bigger know gotta be God in simplicity see and after the opening of the word the OB the seven sales the problem of God said now he said listen he said leave it the way it is he said don't add to it don't take from it he said don't make it any bigger than what it is and he said don't make it any smaller than what it is but there are believers today that are taking the word and they're making it bigger than what it is others wrote they're making it smaller than what it is leave it the way that it is it's ordained to give us resurrection rapturing faith hey man let's get out of here and into eternity hey man how many really want to get out I'll tell you they love us I like Joshua and Caleb they wanted to go in they wanted to possess the lane oh yeah there was times in their battle-ax there's that time when Joshua really felt oh my i need help i need help and he went off to the lord he said lord please he said don't let the day and yet and that's when the Sun Stood Still on one side and moon stood still and the other side yeah it was a need Joshua knew God had promised him to give him the land he said I'll give you the land he's going to possess it he said every place to solve your foot your trade I'll give it to you yeah maybe others would say we afraid maybe others would oh well we better go back with it with the with those that are in the wilderness yeah not stay with Joshua on Caleb well because not all Joshua Kilowog oh my we got such a battle on our hands and and now the Sun is setting please Joshua what are we going to do so Joshua went aside and met the Lord he meant and gods and he spoke and the Sun Stood Still and the moon stood still and yeah not only that scientists scientists vindicated that the science is saying to this regarding time there's this happen and this happened and that happened and we know that the Sun Stood Still for almost 24 hours but there was there was a time when what was the name of the main izakaya yeah and the Prophet when when I went to him and any and he asked he wanted this staff and wanted that to happen so it's time Stood Still and when they put that together with what Joshua did they came up with the full day that was missing in space yeah scientists well that explains it Oh with Joshua did this boy an izakaya did that oh that explains it yeah that's the full day because they were missing the day and that was it oh praise the Lord father God seen control a man if God is in control when it comes to scientific leadership what about your leadership you need him I tell you this you need him very much don't think I know this and I know that you know nothing as you ought to know it without him hey man you need you need him for this wisdom and this understanding this leadership get wisdom get understanding by the grace of God yes that's the will of God let me read it to you again a man is tremendous it says he taught me also and said unto me let I nod retained my words keep my Commandments and live they stay under his leadership you'll do what you want to do don't do what your family wants to do you do what God wants you to do and it says get wisdom get understanding therefore the says wisdom is the principal thing Holy Ghost wisdom amen and it says get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding and it says take fast soul of instruction letter not go keeper for she is thy life amen and amen how many you want to come under and make sure that you're under God's leadership now make sure oh well God's leading me cause me know me out but he God's going to lead you through the fivefold ministry it's like the brother when mother Branham told the brother that he you know you need need to be sit under a minute teaching ministry to be taught the word oh he said I don't need no teacher he said I got the Holy Ghost he teaches me the word well the problem of God said you're right but he said the Holy Ghost uses the teacher because he felt he didn't need the teacher because the Holy Ghost was gonna do it the scripture said this scripture said that the prophecy that's right but he said the Holy Ghost doesn't he does it through the ministry a man and yet there's so many believers out there living for themselves they don't feel they got any it didn't need for any ministry as I said when I knelt at that altar years ago and that person next to me said old thank you Lord for bringing us out of the denomination and now we don't have to be under any man that was the mistake and I said Lord I said they don't have the revelation I said have mercy that's right they feel that we don't have to be subject to this ministry that ministry God has set in the church these god help us that's that's the false teaching of Christianity or you know now you're free it's just you and Jesus you and Jesus I tell you if it's you and Jesus Jesus is with you in the ministry see a teacher yes said in the church the fight for ministry god help us brother but he instead of coming under her husband's leadership she came under the Serpent's leadership and the servants it out of the woman you shall not surely die and God doesn't know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil now he's putting the question on God God knows but he hadn't told you this God's told us what we need to know well we don't need to know he don't eat he's not gonna tell us where's faith faith is believing the revealed word what God reveals what we need to know amen and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise just think of it and she took out the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and it's the same thing in this day an hour brother that many are under the deception of Satan's leadership but yet so close to the word that it would deceive the very elect amen just to bring to your remembrance again and this is the truth he said take heed that no man deceive you be careful oh that's a message preacher that's a message Pragya but be careful they could preach 99% of the message and 1% not the message they could preach a hundred percent of the message and still add one percent add this to add that to it I'll tell it as many many believers are being deceived take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many amen and again he said and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold didn't say there was no love but it's cold it waxes cold the believers don't have the love they used to have not back years ago no not there very very few believers have it please let's be on our guard by eternity if you got his leadership in your life you got his love if he's in control you got I pray I'll tell you this he if he's in control love is his nature God is love praise the Lord because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold Nick woody unbelief doubt you know not saying they're guilty of this like I did like I preach you're going to hell not because of what you did because of what you didn't do that's right and Jesus highlighted that I preached on that going to hell because of what you didn't do jesus said in it's just as much you didn't do it to the least of my brethren you didn't do it to me he said therefore he said depart from me and durable lasting fire they went to hell because of what they didn't do their spirit wasn't right their attitude wasn't right amen but he said he that shall endure he endure these things to the end the same shall be saved it's a lot to endure it's not not easy oh no it's not it's not going to be getting getting better and better better it's going to get harder and harder and harder listen as it was for Jesus so it's going to be worth for us it's gonna get harder and harder and harder you know the probably God said it's in the church age book and he said he said now we're gonna stay here the Lord is gonna leave us there for a season four little yawns ooh we're gonna witness some of that Great Tribulation what for he should to try the testing and the trial of your faith to prove your faith the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world as a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come but he said except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened and praise the name of the Lord go with me to Jude the book of Jude right next to Revelation there's and don't it's only one chapter praise the Lord verse 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance amen another place he's saying oh I going to bring this back to your remembrance though ye once knew this how they're the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not amen and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day and even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner he said giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set for an example suffering the Vengeance of eternal fire as I said before concerning all this going on in the earth I said the fire is falling fire small yeah likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise the minion speak evil of dignities and the dignities are the glorious glorious ones or the glorified ones and they speak evil yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses he Durst not bring against him a Radian accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee keep your attitude rate your spirit rate and even Michael the Archangel kept his attitude and his spirit right toward the devil yea he rebuked him but the Lord he said the Lord rebuke thee a man it's in the hands of God but these be evil of those things which they knew not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in these things they corrupt themselves god elvis wall unto them for they have gone in the way of cain a man yeah he's talking about believers professing believers a man they got in the way of cain what oh yeah there's a lot of believers would would with challenged God as Cain challenged him thou shalt disbelievers as Cain challenged God you know it's the way of Cain and they says they have ran greedily and the way of Cain is opposing God's thoughts god's ideas cause leadership and it says and they have run greedily after the error of Balaam for reward yea the error of Balaam human reasoning a lot of people playing human reasoning to the word they are and that's why they're doing this to do this do this do that your mother we don't reason see we believe with a complete belief and there's no question no doubt no reasoning now if you got faith let's not be guilty of the way of Cain let's not be guilty of the error of balaam human reasoning for reward and perished in the gainsaying of korah denying god's authority and those spirits are still working among believers yeah they're opposing God's leadership in certain areas of their lives they and and they're denying and said we don't well I don't think lore don't mind this I don't think the Lord mind that let's forget it don't have to think just ignore it amen let's not deny God's authority in Gaza leadership in all circumstances and let's not give ourselves over to human reasoning as did Balaam and these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you and feeding themselves without fear yeah feeding themselves without fear where's the fear of God in your life where's the fear of God in your heart your soul today that people are fearing made more than if you're God that's right there brother I'm sick of this whole world and sick of the politics of this whole world it's not normal no more absolutely not normal back years ago the politicians were normal and this was normal that was normal Anat anymore it's all insane the world has gone insane and the problem God warned us that the world was going insane and it is insane I pray God you recognize it don't let that spirit of insanity get you a man and there are believers who have their spirit and sanity on them God have mercy bear with me there's a lot of scriptures that I had but we won't get to them all go with me to numbers the Book of Numbers chapter 27 I just give you a couple of scriptures and then some quotes not here - sir - people with emotional preaching but err to get you to get the Holy Ghost to you with the revelation of the word a man there sometimes preachers did or they can stir you emotionally but not spiritually yeah if we get stir it up stir it up stir it up as all emotion yeah but why would the Holy Ghost is he stirring you and he stirs you by faith by revelation hey man grace in numbers 27 and verse 15 and God spake unto the Lord Moses speak unto the Lord saying let the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation which may go out before him and which may go in before him and which may lead them out and bring them in he said that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd if she got anything it's a leader and it's following leadership oh yeah so it says again said a man over the congregation a man yeah led and it says this man it says which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and bring them in that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd brother as it was in the Old Covenant source in the New Covenant God had shepherds oh yeah they were sheep then were sheep now she bad shepherds then the Sheep got shepherds now and the Shepherd was to lead them according to the word then and the Shepherd's to lead us according to the word now amen and the Lord said unto Moses take the Joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thy hand upon him and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight the responsibility of the will of God and thou shalt but some of them some of them honour upon him that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient and he shall stand before Eliezer Eliezer rather the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord and his words shall they go out and his words shall they come in a man praise the Lord both II and all the soldiers are with him and even all the congregation amen and Moses did as the LORD commanded him and he took Joshua the son they set him before Eleazar the priest before all the congregation praise the name of the Lord and he laid his hands upon him and gave him charge as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses praise the Lord brother God sets man over them and God is using man to lead them so the man is not doing doing it his own way he's doing it God's Way you another scripture Deuteronomy chapter 8 Deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse one all the commandments which I command thee this day shall you observe to do that she may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear under your father's but only Joshua Caleb was getting to the revelation a man of possessing the land only the true bride is getting into the revelation of the Resurrection and the rapture amen not in the head but in the heart closer you get to it you won't be able to do anything else you won't be able to think anything else just morning noon and night it's the resurrection of the rapture no matter what you're doing in your job no matter what you're doing in school at home still it's in your heart the resurrection the rapture you know you're looking for it amen verse 2 it says thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness to Humble thee well God is am Leyna God is allowing this cause allowing this God is producing this producing that 1:40 to Humble you because you when you get down your look up amen God wants us to get down then look up to him they made and he said God has done this he said to Humble thee and prove thee yea God's gonna bring out what's really in you cause bringing up what's really in your heart your spirit your mind a man is it God's leadership or is it human leadership it's the Satan's leadership amen brother let's not be found left in the Satan's Eden no and let's not be under the control of the god of this world the god of this age humbly to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thy words keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make they know that man does not live by bread alone bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord does man live amen are we living by the word come on living by the word so this is the word in you the word in me the wording in your family the word in your home it's just the word the word the word yeah let's be fanatics Jesus was considered a fanatic amen let's be like Jesus are you is God reflected in everything you do oh that brother that sister there honest oh maybe they're religious in all her spiritual the world recognized their religion or not spirituality oh yeah so brother got God have mercy on us is it Jesus they're seeing or is it you no no I'll tell you this if you're a Christian I don't care where you are who you are and who you associate with they don't know there's something different about you oh they will oh yeah they will cus because because the nature you're manifesting how you talk how you act how you react you know what you say and how you say it they know you're different what what makes you different it's Christ it's his leadership is it and not listen it's just not yielding to his leadership well I got Lord I want you to leave me there leave it it's just automatic if you're born again and it's Christ in you it's not you that leaves as Christ that lives in you then then it's just all out of me amen it's just automatic to do this I'll make fun of this all of us yeah the way you act the way you talk the way you order you respond yeah it's just how to make sure it's not used Jesus he's in control but for a lot of believers Satan God is not in control I'll tell you Devils in control because your your your natural birth you're born in sin so Satan's in control of your own nature your feelings and so on but with Jesus you got to be born again amen and that puts Jesus in control by the Holy Ghost hey man I'll tell you you can you you you won't do this you won't do that it's what Jesus creates in us I hate for those things yeah grace he said bursaries again and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed them with manna which thou knewest not and neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord does man live by Raymond wax not all upon thee neither thy foot swell these forty years and thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man tasted his son so the LORD thy God chaste knit date amen therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways and to fear him god help us that were under that leadership that brings us under his control a man with his wisdom in the message on choosing a bride he should remember now he said a man in his way for one he said will you join yourself to a person like that if you would it would certainly kind of disappoint my faith in you then all about God joining himself to something like that a regular denominational prostitute he said do you think that he would do it he said having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof he would never do it he said she must and his character in Earth man must have his character in her and the real true born-again Church must have the character that was in Christ amen so what am I looking at brothers he's a brother Jesus sister Jesus why because the character I've seen is it's a character of Jesus it's not dad's character mom's character the grandmas and grandpas know their new creatures they were like mom and dad but they're not laid no more wood they used to act like mom and dad my mom and dad and no not anymore why now it's Jesus you know mom and dad was our leader but with yeah the teacher was a leader but now it's Christ oh yeah well we would respond to the wave what no we mom and dad would want us to respond or the way that the the teacher want us to respond not now now it's Jesus he's taking control amen and he said the character the real true born-again Church must have the character that was in Christ because the husband and wife are one amen and he said if Jesus did only that which please God and he said kept his word and manifested his word see not just to keep the word manifest to work he said his right will have to be the same kind of character as the breakroom this is amazing he said that it's too bad that we ever get away from real leader he said the real leader he said that God left us to lead the church he never said state procedures he never said a bishop a cardinal a priest or a pope he said he sent the Holy Ghost for the church to lead the church and when he the Holy Ghost has come he will lead you into all truth he will reveal these things to you that I've told you and bring them to your remembrance and we'll show you things that is to come amen these are the people of today he said choosing modern denominations and he said what it does it only reflects their poor understanding of the word get wisdom and get understanding but the right understanding and the way that they're acting today reacting today amen approach they have poor understanding of the Word of God and there's a lot of message believers they don't understand the message the way they should message is not in control the message is not in not their leaders no no it's the reveal word and this will be your leader oh it's the Holy Ghost is my leader but he's gonna lead you according to the word it's the poor understanding of the word and he said I don't mean to hurt but I mean to let it go deep enough so that you will look at it and amen god help us there with me just a couple folks these were made for Christ Christ wasn't made for us we are made for him and that is what we try to do today in our text books is try to make the word which is Christ suit us instead of us trying to make ourselves to suit the word amen he says be in Christ oh yeah I said make the word which is Christ suit us there Amen that's right let God be in control it's not you it's God in control it's not you well I'll do that the words that says I'll do this I'll do that no no if it's Christ in you it's not you doing it it's him doing it and that's what the problem is bringing out and he said it's it's Christ in you he should bring you in line with the word it's not you bringing yourself in line with the word then once you've been born again he takes over by the grace of God a man a man and a man praise the Lord listen he said this is exactly where the church stands today sold or word given character to Satan for our scientific man-made religion when she had the light at the right as the Church of God to stay with the word and have the Holy Ghost working amongst welding the body together with the word welding the body together with the love of God a man and a man and a man remember he said the true Church of Christ the bride his soul sold out to him and his promised word tell every mind that is in Christ is in you the modern church world church also that the spiritual church are both pregnant to give birth to sons one of them a denominational birth is going to give one of these days at World Council of Churches which will produce to the world the Antichrist through a denomination brother let's not oh yeah it's amazing that the spirit of Antichrist is around the message oh no oh yes it is because I tell you a lot of believers got the same spirit as they do out there in denominations and the probably God I lighted that he and there's a quote summer I don't know where it is but the problem of God said he so yeah he said they he said the professing Christians professing this professing that but at the same time he said they got the spirit he shoved the World Council of Churches it's the same spirit we got we better make sure we don't have that spirit and hey you gotta have a right spirit and right attitude but it's the right spirit and right as you the stays with the word the word not Church not Church and enduring you don't just come back to doctrine dot just adjust the doctrine ears this doctrine that doctor no no brother-sister it is Christ in the word Christ in you you love Jesus amen by the grace of God you had to be pregnant by the word and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ amen so I pray grace
