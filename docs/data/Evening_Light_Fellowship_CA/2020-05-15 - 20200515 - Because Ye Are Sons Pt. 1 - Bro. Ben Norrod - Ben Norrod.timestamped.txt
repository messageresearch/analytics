[39:09] I don't know if we ever dreamed that we

[39:16] is even to our brother bid Nora it would
[39:19] be a something of a surprise that that

[39:33] back together again because I'll be
[39:36] honest true there's something else has
[39:37] been a burden on my heart and that I
[39:39] feel that we should be doing and it's
[39:42] been quite a while since we've done it
[39:44] and that's to have communion and as the
[39:46] Lord I said I pray grace that you're
[39:48] going to provide the way I said too for
[39:51] us to have communion again they may so
[39:54] be in prayer for that as well and I
[39:56] trust that by the grace of God if you
[39:58] got the Holy Ghost that you also have
[40:00] have felt the same thing and maybe
[40:02] looking for the same thing once again to
[40:05] get together with the brothers and
[40:06] sisters amen and to partake of the of
[40:09] the bread and wine amen and the foot
[40:12] washing by the grace of God but again we

[40:19] closer to the end of all things amen
[40:22] well the hour is coming when it won't be
[40:24] justice this
[40:26] disease or whatever is going around the
[40:29] world whether the hour is coming when
[40:31] maybe even the even the government's
[40:33] will will try to stop us from getting
[40:35] together amen oh yes they will that
[40:39] hours coming amen so brother it happened
[40:42] in history it's going to happen again at

[40:58] believe in the last service let's
[41:00] consider that sixty-eight million laid
[41:02] down their lives
[41:04] brothers sister and not just to lay down
[41:07] their lives or to to the natural things
[41:09] of life and and they they they forsook
[41:12] that for so fat no no they they they
[41:15] just willingly allowed themselves to be
[41:17] killed murdered for the Gospels sake
[41:21] they did it for Jesus sake amen well
[41:24] they were more than willing as ice wall
[41:25] smoking mode that that sister that was
[41:28] challenged back there many many many
[41:31] years ago and they and they threatened
[41:33] and they said listen lady if you don't
[41:35] forsake this and and what you're
[41:38] believing and all of these things they
[41:41] said we're going to kill your child
[41:43] might even a daughter or her son and
[41:45] she said I can't forsake it I can't give
[41:49] it up and they said well we're going to
[41:51] kill your child she said killed him and
[41:53] she said I'll meet them in glory a man
[41:56] just think she had to make that choice
[41:58] what would be our decision if we had to
[42:02] make a choice like that a man what would
[42:04] be our decision if we got to make
[42:05] choices about but even our jobs and then
[42:08] our homes and our vehicles and all that
[42:10] oh I pray the grace of God we're going
[42:12] to stay with the word amen so we'll lay
[42:16] down our lives and I and all that we're
[42:18] looking for in this world all that the
[42:20] world wants in this world that will be
[42:22] more than willing to sacrifice it for
[42:24] Jesus sake when we consider what he did
[42:27] and we consider what others have done
[42:29] brother god help us a man that will lay
[42:33] down our lives for the Gospels sake for
[42:36] the kingdom of God's sake will lay down
[42:37] our lives for one another amen so the
[42:40] Lord blessed us and we want to welcome
[42:42] our brother Ben nor odd to Newfoundland
[42:45] and a trustee said joy maybe the weather
[42:49] in Tennessee and we want we want to ask
[42:51] him to after weather or dewford land a

[43:10] brother bein as he comes to bring the
[43:12] word to us tonight amen hallelujah and

[49:50] all right how about now brother Matt I
[49:53] we had a technical difficulty can you
[49:57] hear me
[49:59] praise the Lord all right well now III
[50:03] did all that talking I'm gonna have to
[50:05] repeat myself Anna anyhow I said thank
[50:08] you for the opportunity and the
[50:10] privilege of being here and being able
[50:13] to join you by way of the satellite and
[50:16] very thankful the Lord to have this
[50:18] opportunity I want to say thank you to
[50:20] brother Gerald especially for allowing
[50:23] us to arrange this he wrote me sometime
[50:26] back and said can we get a couple nights
[50:28] out of it and I I was so happy to do so
[50:30] I said I was just thankful the Lord to
[50:33] get the opportunity to do it and but I
[50:36] was telling the Brethren when they
[50:37] contacted me about the matter I said
[50:39] well I don't mind doing this but one
[50:42] thing has got to be perfectly settled in
[50:45] my contract it must state that after
[50:48] this is all over with I get to make
[50:49] personal physical visits to Dupin land
[50:52] after all this over with a bet I said
[50:54] that's got to be that way because I I'd
[50:56] rather be on a plane and they're hugging
[50:58] the neck and and seen you face to face
[51:01] ash or miss that but you know I think
[51:04] it's we're seeing some things taking
[51:07] place that we don't know but what this
[51:09] is possibly the phasing in of something
[51:12] we don't know you see how quickly the
[51:14] whole world shut up over one little
[51:16] virus and brother bream talked about we
[51:18] come to a spot to where meetings like
[51:20] what we've experienced will be a fond
[51:22] memory one day and we're seeing that
[51:24] more and more and more it behooves us of
[51:27] course to be ready at any hour at any
[51:29] time that we don't know what time Jesus
[51:33] would come people say well it could be
[51:35] years from now I think this virus has
[51:37] proven to us that just like that things
[51:39] could wrap up just as quickly as like
[51:41] flipping a light switch and the light
[51:43] coming on but anyhow we thank you
[51:45] brother Gerald we love you and sir good
[51:47] to see Bob is singing there in that
[51:48] platform and and I heard I heard Paul

[51:56] and I heard something back there
[51:58] squalling I just a little I
[52:01] didn't think that was sister back there

[52:05] there it is well praise the Lord look at
[52:07] that a man that's beautiful oh just
[52:10] beautiful how did you get something that

[1:01:02] the Lord so thank you again kindly for
[1:01:04] the opportunity to come and and speak
[1:01:07] the word of the Lord now you got your
[1:01:09] Bible Ephesians chapter one let's look
[1:01:10] at verse nine and I want to drop down
[1:01:13] through verses 9 10 11 and 12 then 4
[1:01:16] verses if we can and and by the help of
[1:01:19] the Lord we're going to try to speak
[1:01:22] this evening I want to try to speak upon
[1:01:24] the mystery of his will the mystery of
[1:01:28] his will Paul speaking here in just a
[1:01:30] little bit about the mystery of God's
[1:01:32] will now how many knows that the will of
[1:01:35] God could not be revealed to us until
[1:01:38] this last day to this last time we're
[1:01:39] living and the will of God was something
[1:01:43] that was hidden in the mind of God for
[1:01:45] many many years it was hidden in the
[1:01:47] mind of God but now God's will has been
[1:01:50] made known to us and especially in the
[1:01:52] last day now of what God's mind is for
[1:01:55] us in this last time now let's read
[1:01:57] ephesians 1 pick it up verse 9 having
[1:02:00] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:02:02] will according as to his good pleasure
[1:02:06] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:02:07] hath purposed in himself that in the
[1:02:11] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:02:14] notice that times plural he might gather
[1:02:17] together all right now Paul's telling us
[1:02:19] what this mr.zhou about right here in
[1:02:21] this verse gather together in one all
[1:02:24] things in Christ both which are in
[1:02:27] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:02:31] him all right so the mystery of God's
[1:02:33] will was to gather everything together
[1:02:36] in one in Christ Jesus in whom also we
[1:02:40] have obtained an inheritance
[1:02:42] everybody say I've got an inheritance
[1:02:45] amen praise the Lord being predestinated
[1:02:48] according to the purpose of him who
[1:02:51] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:02:55] his own will of his own will all things
[1:02:59] are working according to the counsel of
[1:03:02] his own will that we should be to the
[1:03:05] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:03:09] Christ amen now let's let's ask the Lord
[1:03:13] to help us in the reading of the word if
[1:03:15] you just bow your head me just a moment
[1:03:17] let's pray together Heavenly Father what
[1:03:20] a privilege it is Lord to be able to
[1:03:21] come father into this place Lord as I
[1:03:25] was thinking about it just momentarily
[1:03:27] you said we're two and three are
[1:03:29] gathered you never told us exactly where
[1:03:32] that place was you just said if they
[1:03:34] were gathered together Lord some met in
[1:03:37] caves and catacombs some meeting great
[1:03:40] big buildings some meet little small
[1:03:42] churches some meet out in the country
[1:03:44] some meet in the city Lord and some of
[1:03:46] them will meet through these ethernet
[1:03:48] waves out of here virtually on these
[1:03:50] little places like Skype and zoom and
[1:03:53] all these other little programs and what
[1:03:55] more that's been made available for the
[1:03:56] world to communicate while sitting in
[1:03:59] their own home but Lord if that is a
[1:04:01] gathering place Lord and you promised if
[1:04:04] we gather two and three in your name you
[1:04:06] promised to be right here now father I'm
[1:04:09] amazed that when I sat down here and
[1:04:11] heard the music playing and brother Bob
[1:04:13] started the service already I felt the
[1:04:16] presence of the Lord right here in this
[1:04:19] little spot what it tells us Lord is
[1:04:22] that the third pool that real true move
[1:04:24] of God in the last day has nothing to do
[1:04:27] with being in a church building it's
[1:04:28] being in Christ and knowing who we are
[1:04:31] all about how we longed to assemble
[1:04:33] ourselves together as well so father
[1:04:35] we're praying that whatever the mind of
[1:04:36] God is for this hour and this time we're
[1:04:38] living in that you'll help us with it
[1:04:40] now and that you'll give us the strength
[1:04:42] that we need to be able to get through
[1:04:44] these trying times
[1:04:45] now father for tonight service may the
[1:04:47] Holy Spirit use me to speak to this
[1:04:49] audience and may the hearts of the
[1:04:51] people be open to receive that which the
[1:04:53] Holy Spirit will say we love you we
[1:04:56] thank you we pray you'll bless your word
[1:04:57] bless all that are listening and
[1:04:59] gathered together online and what more
[1:05:01] and maybe those that might hear it
[1:05:03] afterwards may the Holy Spirit in this
[1:05:04] blessing be with them in Jesus Christ's
[1:05:07] name as we commit the service now both
[1:05:09] speaker and listener in Jesus name Amen
[1:05:12] and amen amen god bless you you may be
[1:05:15] seated may the Lord bless you real good
[1:05:18] somebody asked me they said have you
[1:05:20] been doing a lot of preaching I said yes
[1:05:21] and no I said you know some of the
[1:05:24] shutdown has grounded me altogether and
[1:05:27] I haven't been able to preach and travel
[1:05:29] and things in different places but I've
[1:05:31] been doing a lot of virtual preaching
[1:05:32] just like this and somebody asked me the
[1:05:34] day brother Joe they say can you do it I
[1:05:36] said my goodness I'm an old dog I
[1:05:38] preached on the radio many many a year
[1:05:40] this is just old hat to me the only
[1:05:42] difference is I'm looking you in the
[1:05:43] face rather and look at it a microphone
[1:05:45] that's the only difference so III go
[1:05:47] back I might be young in the face but I
[1:05:50] I'm one of these old timers in that way
[1:05:52] I've done the old way of doing things
[1:05:54] and and and so I'm at home I'm at home
[1:05:57] so I don't want you to be nervous I'm
[1:05:58] not going to be nervous we're going to
[1:06:00] receive from the word of the Lord and if
[1:06:02] you pull remember your faith don't need
[1:06:05] a passport I can feel it sitting right
[1:06:06] here in my little place of worship while
[1:06:09] you're receiving out there in your
[1:06:10] little place of worship and remember
[1:06:13] this is in the days of the voice not the
[1:06:15] body not the presence but in the days of
[1:06:17] the voice that something would be
[1:06:19] accomplished in the last day and so here
[1:06:22] we are gathered under the voice of God
[1:06:23] in these last days now I'm a preacher
[1:06:27] you understand I'm a preacher and and my
[1:06:30] mouth is awful close to this mic so I'm
[1:06:32] gonna try not to shout you out of the
[1:06:33] building but you know maybe maybe the
[1:06:35] Lord will help me just to get the right
[1:06:37] tone but you know you're gonna hurt my
[1:06:39] feelings if you holler glory to God and
[1:06:41] hallelujah a man either and just be
[1:06:43] ready to worship the Lord because I
[1:06:44] think that's why we've taken the
[1:06:46] opportunity to gather like this so we
[1:06:49] can hear from the presence of the Lord
[1:06:51] and and I believe it's a wonderful
[1:06:53] opportunity what an age a golden age if
[1:06:56] you will time that we're living in and
[1:06:58] yes it's difficult lots of folks
[1:07:00] suffering and hurting and lots of things
[1:07:03] going on around us but remember Jesus
[1:07:06] taught us that in the last day it would
[1:07:08] get darker before the light would ever
[1:07:10] begin to shine and we don't look for
[1:07:13] this world to have any hope our hope
[1:07:14] isn't in trudeau our hope isn't in trump
[1:07:17] it's in the last Trump but not this
[1:07:19] Trump a man and it's not in any other
[1:07:21] thing our hope is in Jesus Christ in him
[1:07:24] alone and I'm so glad to be gathered
[1:07:26] together with the Saints of God under
[1:07:28] the auspice of this word of God I was
[1:07:30] laughing the other day by the jail I
[1:07:32] told a group when they were preaching
[1:07:33] sitting in their home I said I used to
[1:07:35] worry about preaching a long time I said
[1:07:37] but now you're in your Barcalounger and
[1:07:38] sitting there probably in your pajamas
[1:07:40] and I don't have to worry about you
[1:07:41] getting tired you already read relaxed
[1:07:43] and rested so we can take our time
[1:07:44] tonight a man but I just want to tell
[1:07:47] you how happy I am to be a Christian and
[1:07:50] I can't think of a better time to live
[1:07:53] in than this right now and somebody said
[1:07:55] to me the other day brother Ben how you
[1:07:57] holding out what's going on with you you
[1:07:59] know you're living and the money you
[1:08:01] make and things comes from the ministry
[1:08:02] and all that I said my goodness this has
[1:08:04] been the best vacation the Lord could
[1:08:06] ever give a guy Amen I had a wonderful
[1:08:08] time and I our needs are met God has
[1:08:12] been blessing us greatly they had just
[1:08:13] been paying our tithes and offerings
[1:08:15] like he told us and everything's falling
[1:08:16] right in our lap just the way we needed
[1:08:18] a man the Lord has blessed us greatly so
[1:08:20] we we want to thank you for your prayers
[1:08:22] for us and our family I made it through
[1:08:25] school I want to thank you for the
[1:08:26] prayers about that and and I said now
[1:08:29] the only person allowed to call me
[1:08:30] doctors my wife it's the only reason
[1:08:32] I've done it in the first place anyhow
[1:08:33] is whenever I want to put the hammer
[1:08:35] down I make her call me dr. Amen that's
[1:08:37] the way that goes but anyhow we we thank
[1:08:39] the Lord and and we appreciate God and
[1:08:42] what he's done for us and and this is a
[1:08:44] beautiful age a time that we're living
[1:08:46] like no other and I want to try to
[1:08:48] introduce to you if God will helped me
[1:08:50] for I don't know maybe 45 minutes to an
[1:08:52] hour we'll just kindly set a pace and
[1:08:54] see how the Lord will take us but I I
[1:08:56] want to try to dig in just a little bit
[1:08:59] if I can on what the mystery of God will
[1:09:01] is now before we go to what it is today
[1:09:04] remember Jesus Christ is the same
[1:09:07] yesterday today and forever how many
[1:09:09] believes that say Amen all right now if
[1:09:12] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:09:13] forever then if we want to know what he
[1:09:16] is today if we want to know what he's
[1:09:17] gonna be tomorrow it's a good indication
[1:09:19] if we look into the past to see what he
[1:09:22] was if we know what he was we know what
[1:09:25] he is and we know what it will be
[1:09:26] because Malachi 3 I am God and I changed
[1:09:30] not he doesn't change so his way of
[1:09:32] doing things he has an unchanging method
[1:09:35] and remember what brother Branham said
[1:09:37] in the church age book he said the very
[1:09:38] reason that we could choose he said the
[1:09:41] messengers of each age was based upon
[1:09:43] the foundation that God never changes
[1:09:46] once he does one thing one time he holds
[1:09:49] that pattern all the way out through the
[1:09:50] ages but now remember as I preach to you
[1:09:53] many times before God slowly unfolded
[1:09:56] the mystery of God slowly unfolded the
[1:09:59] mystery of God letting out just little
[1:10:01] bits and pieces of what he thought of
[1:10:03] what his will was and if we go all the
[1:10:06] way back to the beginning we see that
[1:10:08] the will of God was housed in the words
[1:10:11] and it was cased in the words the day
[1:10:14] you eat thereof is the day you died the
[1:10:16] first time we find God declaring his
[1:10:19] will to the people upon earth Adam and
[1:10:21] Eve as they stood there on planet Earth
[1:10:24] God is
[1:10:25] evoking and he's impressing his will
[1:10:28] upon humanity said the day you eat is
[1:10:31] the day you die don't touch it and then
[1:10:33] don't have nothing to do with the tree
[1:10:36] of sexual desire stay away from that the
[1:10:39] tree which is in the midst that is the
[1:10:40] first inkling that we get in the Bible
[1:10:43] is Moses roaded of the will of God for
[1:10:46] Humanity now we see that and we claim
[1:10:49] that as being the will of God but I want
[1:10:52] to submit to you tonight that there was
[1:10:54] an even greater will behind that will
[1:10:57] because remember the Prophet tells us in
[1:10:59] spoken words original seed and don't
[1:11:01] forget this quotation because this will
[1:11:03] help you throughout tonight as you begin
[1:11:05] to see the message come together a
[1:11:06] little bit brother Branham teaches us
[1:11:08] that it was genuinely God's will and
[1:11:11] predestinated Eve to fall in the very
[1:11:15] now we've been through it sometimes
[1:11:16] they're the last three or four years of
[1:11:17] the church and taking that fall and
[1:11:19] really dissected it but just suffice to
[1:11:21] say tonight just to get the picture in
[1:11:23] your mind that it was God's will for her
[1:11:25] to fall so when God placed his word out
[1:11:29] there before him the day you eat thereof
[1:11:30] is the day you die we see presented
[1:11:33] God's mind for that situation but behind
[1:11:36] the words was a will that God wanted to
[1:11:40] see manifested even though him knowing
[1:11:43] they could not keep the word that was
[1:11:44] presented and the word that was
[1:11:46] presented would not be the thing that
[1:11:48] they would keep and God knowing that all
[1:11:50] along he placed the word out there as an
[1:11:53] instrument to work out the will that
[1:11:55] hung behind those words are you
[1:11:57] following what I'm saying this far
[1:11:58] alright now remember whenever he
[1:12:01] predestinate Siebe he predestinate sure
[1:12:04] that she would fall all right once she
[1:12:06] falls in the Garden of Eden then God's
[1:12:09] will is set in motion remember the
[1:12:11] Prophet said in Jesus Christ or in
[1:12:13] Almighty God we should say Amen because
[1:12:15] Christ wasn't created yet or Jesus
[1:12:17] wasn't created yet but in Almighty God
[1:12:20] Jehovah God Elohim was the attributes to
[1:12:23] be a savior to be a father to be a
[1:12:25] redeemer to be all of these things but
[1:12:29] remember there was nobody not one person
[1:12:31] anywhere that had the ability to
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:36] God being a healer there was nobody sick
[1:12:39] so he couldn't there's nobody had the
[1:12:40] ability to be healed from a sickness
[1:12:42] when there was just perfection he's a
[1:12:44] resurrector so there was nobody dead so
[1:12:47] how could he resurrect when there's
[1:12:48] nobody dared not even a leaf withered in
[1:12:50] the Garden of Eden so God's will was
[1:12:53] that man would fall in the beginning
[1:12:55] that was God's desire in God's will so
[1:12:58] that all of the attributes that laid
[1:13:00] inside of him could be expressed are you
[1:13:03] with me so far all right now if you
[1:13:05] notice the way that this comes together
[1:13:07] then the Lord God would then reveal bits
[1:13:10] and pieces of his will as he would go
[1:13:13] out through time and down through the
[1:13:15] stream of time you would find that he
[1:13:17] would reveal bits and portions of his
[1:13:19] will so see in the Garden of Eden we see
[1:13:22] the serpent standing there he is a part
[1:13:24] of the original sin his arms and his
[1:13:27] legs are taken off of it and he's taken
[1:13:29] to his belly then we find many years
[1:13:31] later there's Moses standing there they
[1:13:33] standing with the children of Israel
[1:13:34] standing there in the wilderness and
[1:13:36] he's got a serpent on a pole a brass
[1:13:38] serpent on a pole which brass represents
[1:13:40] judgment showing forth that sin had
[1:13:43] already been judged in that serpent on
[1:13:46] the pole and God just slowly unfolding
[1:13:49] part of this mystery in bits and pieces
[1:13:52] then we come along a few thousand or a
[1:13:54] few hundred years later I should say and
[1:13:56] we find Isaiah saying that a virgin
[1:13:59] shall conceive in the last day is that
[1:14:01] right and then if she is to conceive in
[1:14:04] the last day in the last time remember
[1:14:06] it would come in the hour that Peter
[1:14:08] would describe in the last days when
[1:14:10] Jesus showed up it was the last days of
[1:14:13] all that Old Testament time you know
[1:14:16] when I was a boy my grandmother she
[1:14:17] loved to do puzzles and it was one of
[1:14:20] the greatest things to her she lived her
[1:14:22] life doing one puzzle after another and
[1:14:24] if you've ever done a puzzle you know
[1:14:25] that you don't get the full picture
[1:14:26] right away I know some people would like
[1:14:29] to see it happen that way just pour in
[1:14:30] the box out and there it is but you got
[1:14:32] to work at a little bit and what you
[1:14:34] have to do is you got to take one piece
[1:14:36] put it with another one put another with
[1:14:37] another with another spin them around a
[1:14:40] little bit do some investigation for a
[1:14:42] while find the colors that match the
[1:14:44] lines the spots that match and
[1:14:46] eventually the picture begins to come
[1:14:49] together now remember God had laid his
[1:14:51] puzzle pieces out through those Old
[1:14:54] Testament time periods through those Old
[1:14:56] Testament ages he would drop a puzzle
[1:14:58] piece here drop a puzzle piece here drop
[1:15:01] another piece here drop another piece
[1:15:02] here but then when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:05] shows up then the picture of all these
[1:15:08] things is beginning to come together
[1:15:10] look at these little parts that was
[1:15:12] unfolding he said that a virgin shout
[1:15:15] conceived I never come right out and
[1:15:16] told us you know word verbatim what it
[1:15:19] was in the Garden of Eden but I say as
[1:15:21] words declare to us hallelujah what it
[1:15:24] was that took place in the Garden of
[1:15:26] Eden if a virgin needed to bring forth
[1:15:29] the Messiah then it must have been an
[1:15:31] unburden like act in the garden that put
[1:15:33] us in this mess in the first place can
[1:15:35] you say man now when we look at the
[1:15:37] puzzle piece begin to come together we
[1:15:39] look at the mystery of God's will
[1:15:41] notice that when in Exodus 20 the
[1:15:44] children of Israel stood there crying
[1:15:46] out give us a law give us along now we
[1:15:48] know God's original will had nothing to
[1:15:51] do with the law had nothing to do with
[1:15:54] keeping of law washing of pots and pans
[1:15:56] none of that was in the mind of God but
[1:15:59] God's Way was grace grace provided a
[1:16:02] prophet grace provided manna grace
[1:16:04] provided water from the rock grace
[1:16:06] provided the cloud grace provided the
[1:16:08] pillar of fire grace provided the quail
[1:16:10] grace provided everything they had need
[1:16:12] of but now here is man crying give us a
[1:16:16] law hmm in that right wanting something
[1:16:19] to do oh you know man ain't changed too
[1:16:20] much he's still in the same boat doing
[1:16:22] the same old things he still wants to
[1:16:24] try to make something happen in order to
[1:16:26] consider himself to be righteous but
[1:16:28] remember the law could never bring forth
[1:16:31] the true mystery of God's will because
[1:16:35] the law was even though the law coming
[1:16:38] from God had to be perfect this is why
[1:16:40] when Jesus showed up Jesus himself said
[1:16:42] that I didn't come to destroy the law of
[1:16:45] course not how could he destroy
[1:16:46] something that was perfect how could he
[1:16:48] destroy something that was already in
[1:16:50] God's mind as being a perfect thing
[1:16:53] anything that comes out of God is
[1:16:55] perfect even though man himself couldn't
[1:16:57] live it hmm even though man himself
[1:17:00] couldn't manifest it but yet if it come
[1:17:02] from God it was perfection as it come
[1:17:05] from God so then it would take one the
[1:17:08] Lord Jesus Christ then to come and
[1:17:10] complete the puzzle of it all now watch
[1:17:13] him when he shows up the mystery of
[1:17:15] God's will is that pillar of fire hung
[1:17:17] there between them cherubims and and
[1:17:19] those those wingtips come together and
[1:17:22] the pillar of fire would rest in between
[1:17:23] those wingtips and then here the priests
[1:17:25] would walk in sacrifice in his hand step
[1:17:29] in there with the blood and what more
[1:17:30] and the smoke of God and the fire of God
[1:17:32] would come down the people would say all
[1:17:34] the Lord has accepted us and if not
[1:17:36] they'd start crying for God's mercy God
[1:17:38] have mercy God help us Lord and be with
[1:17:41] us they only knew enough about God to
[1:17:44] know that God was merciful by the
[1:17:46] sacrifice that he was a judge that there
[1:17:50] was justice to be measured out if they
[1:17:52] did wrong and remember they knew him by
[1:17:54] the washing of pots and pans tastes not
[1:17:57] touch not handle not keeping a day's
[1:17:59] Sabbath moons all of that but remember
[1:18:03] the will of God had not been fully
[1:18:05] revealed in that Old Testament because
[1:18:08] the puzzle was still coming together
[1:18:10] yeah amen there was still pieces that
[1:18:13] had to be put together are you with me
[1:18:15] so far now notice when Jesus comes in
[1:18:18] here then the Lord Jesus Christ is going
[1:18:22] to become a
[1:18:24] master portion of this puzzle a lot of
[1:18:29] the picture is going to come together in
[1:18:31] the fulfillment and in the manifestation
[1:18:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ but remember
[1:18:36] Adam was called the first man Adam by
[1:18:39] the Apostle Paul and Jesus was called
[1:18:41] the last man Adam notice he wasn't
[1:18:43] called the second man Adam because there
[1:18:45] had been a second there could have been
[1:18:46] a third but Jesus was called the last
[1:18:48] man Adam showing that after the first
[1:18:51] Adam fell in Eden that Jesus would be
[1:18:54] the last Adam well just like the first
[1:18:56] Adam he had an Eve as part of his
[1:18:58] picture a woman that come from him now
[1:19:00] Jesus Christ has a woman that is drawn
[1:19:04] from him in the last day the bride of
[1:19:06] Jesus Christ so Christ would make up all
[1:19:09] of the picture all of the puzzle pieces
[1:19:12] that would make up all of that Old
[1:19:15] Testament remember brother Brennan told
[1:19:16] us a masterpiece that he was building up
[1:19:19] the body in those ages and building it
[1:19:21] up through the prophets and he talked
[1:19:22] about the four corners of that pedestal
[1:19:24] that the statue sat on he talked about
[1:19:27] Joseph being perfection and Abraham
[1:19:29] being grace and all these others and he
[1:19:32] talked about how the prophets would
[1:19:33] build that body up but then here comes
[1:19:35] the Lord Jesus Christ who is the
[1:19:38] headstone hallelujah of all that was
[1:19:41] laying in that Old Testament hey man and
[1:19:43] now he sits down on the rest of the body
[1:19:45] completing that portion of the puzzle
[1:19:48] but there's still some things missing
[1:19:50] there's still some pieces missing in
[1:19:53] this great masterpiece because remember
[1:19:56] no matter how much the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:57] and all of his Grace and all of his
[1:19:59] mercy manifested himself remember even
[1:20:02] jesus said the son can do nothing but
[1:20:04] what the father shows him
[1:20:06] not even the Sun knows the day nor the
[1:20:08] hour at the returning of the Son of Man
[1:20:10] there were many things that Jesus could
[1:20:12] have said but was it permitted to say it
[1:20:14] because the mystery of God's will was
[1:20:17] not yet being revealed just yet remember
[1:20:20] even him coming he said I came not to
[1:20:22] destroy but I come to fulfill I come to
[1:20:24] set at variance father and mother and
[1:20:26] families and sister and brethren what
[1:20:28] more I come to bring a sword am i they
[1:20:31] must have thought well yeah that's what
[1:20:33] we want them Israelites looking for a
[1:20:34] fight all the time gets him Romans they
[1:20:36] thought the a break him sword Jesus
[1:20:37] that's what we want not realize them
[1:20:40] that the sword he was bringing was not a
[1:20:42] division from one of the other but it
[1:20:44] was a division between those that were
[1:20:47] God's seed and then the rest of the
[1:20:49] world that was the true division look at
[1:20:51] your own household some of y'all are
[1:20:53] believers and got family members when he
[1:20:55] walk across the street to go to church
[1:20:57] you know here we sit here tonight we're
[1:21:00] enjoying the presence of the Lord set in
[1:21:02] the house of God this little shutdown
[1:21:04] probably didn't disappoint too many
[1:21:05] folks around this message
[1:21:07] because they didn't go to church when
[1:21:09] they had the doors open you know I'm
[1:21:11] talking about but yet here we said we
[1:21:13] loved it we we just enjoy being gathered
[1:21:18] in the presence of the Lord because we
[1:21:20] love this word and we love what it
[1:21:22] stands for what it means to our hearts
[1:21:24] it goes to prove that God's will God's
[1:21:28] life was made up in Jesus Christ that's
[1:21:32] true but not everything was revealed
[1:21:34] when Jesus showed up now here comes Paul
[1:21:37] telling us that the mystery of God's
[1:21:40] will I want you to think about that a
[1:21:41] minute the mystery of God's will he said
[1:21:44] is now being made known to us all right
[1:21:48] well what was that mystery of his will
[1:21:49] all right first of all we know where the
[1:21:51] BAM tells us in the last day that there
[1:21:53] are two phases to God's will he tells us
[1:21:56] that there is a permissive will of God
[1:21:57] he tells us that there is a perfect will
[1:22:00] of God and he tells us that the
[1:22:02] permissive will will always wrap around
[1:22:05] somehow another until it comes back to
[1:22:07] God's perfect will so no matter how far
[1:22:10] we might stray little things that might
[1:22:12] come along one thing we can be confident
[1:22:14] of is that God's will will be done and
[1:22:18] life in my life no matter what may be
[1:22:20] sitting out there in front of us no
[1:22:22] matter what naysayers might say this or
[1:22:25] that the will of God will be done in you
[1:22:27] and I no matter what the world says
[1:22:29] about it God desires that we would be a
[1:22:32] people that would fulfill the very mind
[1:22:35] and the will of God now if he makes
[1:22:38] known to us what is the mystery of his
[1:22:40] will look at it again in verse 9
[1:22:42] according to his good pleasure
[1:22:44] which he hath purposed in himself well
[1:22:48] what was it that pleased God
[1:22:50] his purpose his purpose was pleasing to
[1:22:54] him and what was his purpose I certainly
[1:22:58] don't think God wanted to stir well
[1:23:00] between them cherubims and come and
[1:23:02] Thunder the mountain and shake the
[1:23:03] mountaintops and speak through prophets
[1:23:05] and things like that surely you don't
[1:23:06] think that's the only thing God had in
[1:23:08] his mind
[1:23:09] if you do you're missing the purpose of
[1:23:12] it because the real purpose of God
[1:23:14] wasn't to come and shake the mountain
[1:23:16] and scare the people to death and show
[1:23:18] that he's some kind of powerful being
[1:23:20] his purpose was so he could reveal
[1:23:23] himself to you in an intimate way in a
[1:23:26] way that you couldn't experience with
[1:23:29] the shaking of the mountain and the
[1:23:30] Thunder and the lightning you see I
[1:23:32] think that's one reason we get in such
[1:23:34] trouble around the ranks to the message
[1:23:35] we chase all these little old things and
[1:23:37] all of this supernatural fandangled
[1:23:39] everything and we miss the real genuine
[1:23:41] purpose of God which was Christ becoming
[1:23:45] intimate persons with us
[1:23:47] that was his whole purpose from the very
[1:23:49] beginning the whole reason glory he let
[1:23:52] Eve fall in the beginning
[1:23:54] was to become intimate persons with us
[1:23:57] so that we could have a relationship and
[1:24:01] then that relationship would bring us
[1:24:04] into a unity and bring us into an
[1:24:06] intimacy that could not be expressed
[1:24:08] through the washing of pots and pans
[1:24:10] taste not touch not handle not oh it's
[1:24:13] it's a beautiful thing when you look at
[1:24:14] it now talking about the mystery of
[1:24:16] God's will there is a
[1:24:18] permissive well that's what God was
[1:24:20] telling him when he told him don't eat
[1:24:23] well he knew they were going to do it
[1:24:25] anyhow Peter that he was going to do the
[1:24:28] things she done and act the way she
[1:24:29] acted he knew it matter of fact he
[1:24:32] planned for it to be just that way he
[1:24:34] allowed things to fall into the
[1:24:36] permissive side so that it could wrap
[1:24:39] back around to his perfect will because
[1:24:41] when this is all said and done and you
[1:24:43] and I are gathered in eternal bodies
[1:24:45] just imagine that we won't even need
[1:24:47] Ethernet hallelu we travel like a
[1:24:49] thought rather they think their internet
[1:24:51] is fast they never had God thought power
[1:24:53] before that's that's the fastest speed
[1:24:54] there is a hallelujah
[1:24:58] to be able to travel like a thought oh
[1:25:01] yeah that's coming to us one day yes sir
[1:25:03] this little measly thing we got down
[1:25:06] here on the earth it's only a type of
[1:25:08] what's getting ready to come down the
[1:25:09] way
[1:25:10] but God when we gather there it'll all
[1:25:13] right back to his perfect wheel because
[1:25:15] looky here but about him when he met
[1:25:17] them beyond the curtain of time there
[1:25:19] was no sex glands in the body then women
[1:25:20] were hugging him and crying precious
[1:25:22] brethren he didn't feel one sensation
[1:25:24] showing that the permissive was wrapping
[1:25:26] right back around into the perfect will
[1:25:28] of God the way God intended in the
[1:25:30] beginning however expressing all of his
[1:25:33] desires down here in time making himself
[1:25:36] a savior and a lord and a deliverer and
[1:25:38] all the things that he was so that we
[1:25:41] could come together in the newness of
[1:25:43] life and
[1:25:44] in the new birth as intimate persons
[1:25:47] with Almighty God now listen this and
[1:25:49] the adoption this paragraph 75 76 is
[1:25:52] part four but the mem said now look he
[1:25:54] has predestinated us unto his
[1:25:56] inheritance he said if I am a right
[1:25:59] inheritance of something he said if God
[1:26:02] is knocking at my heart and saying
[1:26:04] William Branham I called you a long time
[1:26:06] before the foundation of the world to
[1:26:08] preach the gospel I have an inheritance
[1:26:10] and inheritance of eternal life he said
[1:26:12] now God sent Jesus watch now to make
[1:26:16] that inheritance real to me how do they
[1:26:19] do you
[1:26:20] that was the purpose of Jesus showing up
[1:26:23] my inheritance was given to me before
[1:26:26] the foundation of the world I didn't
[1:26:29] come to the altar and all of a sudden
[1:26:30] get saved and get an inheritance no that
[1:26:32] was given to me before the foundation of
[1:26:35] the world
[1:26:36] but it wasn't real to me why wasn't it
[1:26:39] real to me cuz I didn't know what the
[1:26:41] will of God was I didn't know what the
[1:26:43] plan of God was how can you tap into the
[1:26:46] richness of God's way if you don't know
[1:26:49] what the will of God is for your life
[1:26:51] and Prince let's be honest that's where
[1:26:52] a lot of people struggle in this last
[1:26:54] day is what is the will of God
[1:26:56] well it's very simple the will of God
[1:26:58] isn't about having great supernatural
[1:27:00] visions and great big tent meetings and
[1:27:02] the thousands getting healed and and all
[1:27:04] that's wonderful thank God for every
[1:27:06] thing has been done to help humanity but
[1:27:08] the real plan and purpose of God was so
[1:27:11] you and him could become one they been
[1:27:14] somebody save
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:16] you and him become one one persons with
[1:27:19] Jesus Christ that you could become amen
[1:27:22] a partnership this is a co partnership
[1:27:25] amen I'm a joint heir with him I'm not a
[1:27:28] slave I'm not a subordinate we're
[1:27:30] co-heirs Co II that's right he is my
[1:27:34] Lord that's true but he's made me equal
[1:27:37] to everything now Jesus sent was sent to
[1:27:39] make that inheritance real and I watch
[1:27:41] he said there was nothing I could do to
[1:27:44] inherit it oh
[1:27:46] I'd like to get that through the heads
[1:27:48] of some of these people around here
[1:27:50] running around saying well I live good
[1:27:52] and I believe the message and I do thank
[1:27:54] you you may do every bit of it brother
[1:27:56] and you might preach and you might have
[1:27:57] the biggest Church in the message but
[1:27:59] there's nothing you or me or anybody
[1:28:00] else could have done to inherit this
[1:28:02] eternal promise of God
[1:28:04] if it could have been that way then the
[1:28:07] law was all we needed we should have
[1:28:08] stopped at the law
[1:28:10] but the law could not reveal the true
[1:28:14] will of God
[1:28:16] the law was a schoolmaster remember what
[1:28:19] Paul told us in the book of Galatians he
[1:28:20] said that we were trained like children
[1:28:22] under the schoolmaster the law was a
[1:28:24] schoolmaster
[1:28:25] teaching us to be obedient teaching us
[1:28:28] to reverence teaching us fear of God but
[1:28:32] all of those that was able to fear God
[1:28:35] yet some of them are the very ones when
[1:28:38] Jesus said would you walk off - from
[1:28:40] that time they walked no more with him
[1:28:41] they just kept going that's st. on 666
[1:28:44] by the way
[1:28:46] that ain't no tattoo or some microchip
[1:28:48] in your wrist neither
[1:28:50] rejecting that word of God that's what
[1:28:51] that true mark is and people set right
[1:28:54] in the Pew sit right in the church that
[1:28:57] same mindset well I'll do I'll do all
[1:29:00] right if you believe this prophet of God
[1:29:01] right here he said there's nothing I
[1:29:03] could do to inherit that promise of God
[1:29:05] it was solely on the grace of God Oh
[1:29:09] church are you thankful for the grace of
[1:29:11] God or what are you
[1:29:13] that goes to prove Amen and and this is
[1:29:17] what I love otherwise so now watch this
[1:29:18] this is beautiful right here because
[1:29:20] there was nothing he said it was blank
[1:29:22] it was valid he said
[1:29:26] Mithen I could do but in the fullness of
[1:29:29] time God sent his son in his own good
[1:29:33] time glory Jesus the lamb slain from the
[1:29:37] foundation the Lord his blood was shed
[1:29:39] oh oh I like this brother bomb he said
[1:29:42] now that I may go to my inheritance to
[1:29:44] be what what inheritance everybody ready
[1:29:48] say many of you are
[1:29:50] to be a sonship
[1:29:53] to be a son of God a
[1:29:56] brother we get all hung up on on what
[1:29:59] the Sun gets I'd rather be the Sun first
[1:30:03] huh we hung up on what possessions does
[1:30:08] the Sun get you hear preachers preaching
[1:30:10] that day in this state all the bride's
[1:30:11] got the bride gets the bride has yeah
[1:30:14] that's wonderful thank God for every
[1:30:16] possession God gives to me but I'd
[1:30:18] rather be a son first and it free about
[1:30:22] what I get later
[1:30:24] because I Got News for You brethren I've
[1:30:27] said it a Newfoundland before and let me
[1:30:28] say to you Newfoundlanders again if I if
[1:30:31] heaven ain't nothing but a mud Shack
[1:30:33] Alleluia and the River of Life ain't
[1:30:35] nothing but a little trickle of water
[1:30:37] down a little muddy bank
[1:30:39] to be a son
[1:30:42] to be born again
[1:30:44] to be his child that's enough if I never
[1:30:47] speak the word with the big about that
[1:30:49] nowadays speak the word speak the word
[1:30:51] if I never speak a word
[1:30:54] amen brother Gerald if I never raise the
[1:30:56] dead
[1:30:58] huh now some of you and the invisible
[1:31:01] audience in your living rooms are where
[1:31:02] you are you better holler a man -
[1:31:03] because Amen it might get a little quiet
[1:31:05] in this church as I keep going here
[1:31:09] we have to thank church a lot of times
[1:31:11] we Gentiles remember Jesus talked about
[1:31:14] a wicked adulterous generation they run
[1:31:16] after signs but our inheritance is not a
[1:31:20] sign Church our inheritance is a sonship
[1:31:25] please
[1:31:27] that son son that is the mystery of
[1:31:31] God's will they had all of these virtues
[1:31:35] in how am I going to get this revelation
[1:31:37] of my sons how am I going to get the
[1:31:40] revelation of my sons now we're coming
[1:31:42] to the meat of what I want to talk about
[1:31:43] here and I hope you're followed my
[1:31:45] thought on this but how are they going
[1:31:47] to come to the revelation of mark 16 lay
[1:31:49] their hands on the sick and they shall
[1:31:51] recover if they don't recognize they're
[1:31:53] a son and a son has the attributes of
[1:31:56] his daddy and if his daddy was a healer
[1:31:58] that puts them in a healing position
[1:32:00] where they can lay their hands and be
[1:32:01] healers of
[1:32:03] course we know it is in our flesh or
[1:32:05] something like that course not but it's
[1:32:07] the it's the healing power that's on the
[1:32:09] inside of us remember how book of Acts
[1:32:12] declared it and let's not mince words I
[1:32:14] say it like the Bible said it the Bible
[1:32:15] said the disciples went around healing
[1:32:17] well where did they get that attribute
[1:32:19] from they were sons as sons and
[1:32:23] daughters the healing attribute of the
[1:32:25] Holy Ghost laid inside of them who I
[1:32:28] should have built me a little bit of
[1:32:29] bigger room in this little cubby I'm
[1:32:30] sitting in here I'm about to go shouting
[1:32:32] around a little bit
[1:32:34] hallelujah
[1:32:36] son to have sonship glory to God it puts
[1:32:40] us in a position brother don't worry
[1:32:43] about what we got worry about who we are
[1:32:46] first
[1:32:48] what Jesus said in Matthew 6:33 he said
[1:32:51] seek first the kingdom of God everything
[1:32:52] else would be added but seek first that
[1:32:54] kingdom
[1:32:56] you man and the kingdom of God came not
[1:32:58] in meat and drink and new wines and New
[1:33:01] Moon's and but it's the kingdom of power
[1:33:03] and sonship that's what we are Jesus
[1:33:06] come to make that sonship real to you
[1:33:09] and I oh
[1:33:11] yeah in that one hallelujah even you
[1:33:15] sisters can holler Amen on that son part
[1:33:17] because you part of a son someone
[1:33:18] another sure enough amen and at that son
[1:33:21] ain't sitting next to you he that's the
[1:33:22] son of God in heaven sure enough maybe
[1:33:25] some widow woman sitting out there well
[1:33:26] what son of my part of the Son of God
[1:33:28] amen the son the Esso in of God that's
[1:33:30] right don't not even the sisters out in
[1:33:33] this we talked about sons but don't
[1:33:35] forget daughters of God are part of this
[1:33:37] as well that's right to be what in and
[1:33:40] he said what inheritance to sonship to
[1:33:43] be a son of God watch this paragraph 76
[1:33:45] now this may choke you to death thank me
[1:33:48] I hope after all these years we still
[1:33:50] ain't getting choked on this
[1:33:52] but did you know that men that are sons
[1:33:55] of God are a mature God's if you believe
[1:33:58] it say Amen
[1:34:00] how many ever knowed that how many knows
[1:34:02] Jesus said so the Bible said Jesus said
[1:34:05] did not the law itself say ye are gods
[1:34:09] and if you called them God's whom the
[1:34:11] word of the Lord come to him and he said
[1:34:13] which God said in Genesis 2 that they
[1:34:15] were God's because they had full domain
[1:34:18] dominion over the world praise the Lord
[1:34:21] he given dominion over all things he
[1:34:24] lost his God ship thank you that he lost
[1:34:29] his sonship he lost his domain Satan
[1:34:32] took it over but brother were waiting
[1:34:36] for the manifestation of the sons of
[1:34:39] color
[1:34:41] what is that manifestation alright if by
[1:34:44] losing it he loses his God ship loses
[1:34:47] his sonship loses his position loses his
[1:34:50] domain then cry let's just be very
[1:34:53] simple about it quite simply if if I've
[1:34:57] got these papers in my hand and I lose
[1:34:59] them what is the matter station that
[1:35:02] I've got of my work it's back in my
[1:35:05] hands
[1:35:07] you understand what I'm saying if I lose
[1:35:11] something what is the manifestation that
[1:35:14] I've received it it's back where it
[1:35:16] belongs
[1:35:18] that's what the manifestation of the
[1:35:20] sons of God is that's why a prophet in
[1:35:22] this last day spoke squirrel's that's
[1:35:24] why I spoke to storms that's why he
[1:35:25] controlled nature so I done this that
[1:35:27] and the other to prove to us that man's
[1:35:30] domain as a god was coming right back
[1:35:33] into him and his position was being
[1:35:35] restored through the revelation of the
[1:35:37] word
[1:35:40] absolutely
[1:35:41] now imagine this God knew before there
[1:35:45] was a star that there be a coronavirus
[1:35:48] God knew before there was a son that
[1:35:51] there'd be the bird flu God knew that
[1:35:53] there'd be the hog flu
[1:35:56] God through that time lasas gonna be
[1:35:59] everything from a horse flu to a you
[1:36:02] name it
[1:36:03] it ain't gonna get better it's gonna get
[1:36:05] worse the Bible tells us so
[1:36:08] prophesied to us he said little bride
[1:36:10] it's gonna get darker before it starts
[1:36:12] getting lighter
[1:36:14] and remember in the last hours when them
[1:36:16] plagues begin to fall don't forget
[1:36:19] little sons who was sitting there in the
[1:36:21] daylight while the rest of the world was
[1:36:23] dark
[1:36:23] [Laughter]
[1:36:27] why the red stuff why the rest of him
[1:36:30] was sitting out there in darkness
[1:36:32] lorry the sons of God was sitting over
[1:36:35] in Goshen and beautiful daylight
[1:36:38] and what far from there the other day
[1:36:41] that
[1:36:42] January we were sitting there in Egypt
[1:36:43] we was about an hour or something like
[1:36:45] that I think it was from the Fertile
[1:36:47] Crescent right up there in Goshen and
[1:36:48] and I thought as we were crossing
[1:36:50] through that land come and saw the
[1:36:51] pyramids and doing mission work there in
[1:36:53] Egypt and as I stood up and looked at
[1:36:55] the top of that Great Pyramid up here
[1:36:57] and didn't have no capstone on it I
[1:36:58] thought oh yeah that's true ain't she
[1:37:01] ain't got no capstone Enoch wasn't
[1:37:03] permitted to reveal the mystery of the
[1:37:05] will then know there were seven steps in
[1:37:08] the King's Chamber there were three pole
[1:37:09] pulls hiding in there there was all
[1:37:11] these different little places they tell
[1:37:13] me if you make another little turn
[1:37:14] there's a queen chamber in there as well
[1:37:16] oh yes all the mystery of that word was
[1:37:19] wrote right there in that pyramid but it
[1:37:21] had no capstone because it wasn't
[1:37:23] permitted to be revealed in that hour
[1:37:25] but all a little bride don't you realize
[1:37:28] where you're sitting right now
[1:37:29] you're sitting in the revelation of the
[1:37:32] capstone message
[1:37:34] the message that is revealing to us what
[1:37:37] that capstone was what is a capstone it
[1:37:41] is a stone a perfect stone in its
[1:37:43] perfect position where it belongs and
[1:37:45] where it was predestinated to be
[1:37:47] what is it for you and I it's the same
[1:37:50] thing as sons of God we have a position
[1:37:53] remember you don't get that position by
[1:37:55] going to the altar and jabbering in
[1:37:57] tongues or shouting a little bit or
[1:37:58] Haughton glory glory glory I believe the
[1:38:00] message for the RAM is a prophet that
[1:38:01] ain't where your positions determine
[1:38:03] your position was established if your
[1:38:04] bride before the world ever began now
[1:38:07] you just have to recognize what that
[1:38:09] position is all about that's right he
[1:38:12] lost his God ship lost his sonship lost
[1:38:14] his domain Satan took it over but
[1:38:17] brother we're waiting for the
[1:38:18] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:38:20] lorry who will come and take it back
[1:38:22] over again amen
[1:38:25] waiting for the fullness of time
[1:38:27] remember Paul said times plural right
[1:38:30] here's the other fullness of time the
[1:38:31] bride fullness when the pyramid gets to
[1:38:34] the top listen to this when the full
[1:38:37] sons of God will be manifested when the
[1:38:40] power of God will walk out hallelujah
[1:38:43] says and take every power that Satan's
[1:38:46] got back from him yes sir it belongs to
[1:38:49] him that's right
[1:38:51] the full manifestation of sons alright
[1:38:54] let's talk a while what is those sons
[1:38:57] what does that look like what what is
[1:38:59] the manifestation of sons now friends I
[1:39:01] want you to get it out of your mind that
[1:39:05] our life's mission down here at this
[1:39:07] fulfilling of this age is to come to a
[1:39:09] spot to where if a storm is bothering us
[1:39:11] we can holler at it go away and it goes
[1:39:13] away
[1:39:15] get it out of your mind that God wants
[1:39:17] you to walk out into a field of a
[1:39:20] forest of a bunch of trees and start
[1:39:22] creating squirrels get it out of your
[1:39:24] mind that that's the purpose for your
[1:39:25] life
[1:39:27] now let me say to this this way to you
[1:39:29] this we will do if God permit sure
[1:39:32] baptized repentance laying on a hands
[1:39:35] break into the bread communion brother
[1:39:37] gerald these things like you spoke up a
[1:39:39] little bit ago of sharing the cup of the
[1:39:41] blood of Jesus Christ and fellowship
[1:39:43] that cleanses us amen as we walk in the
[1:39:46] light what more wonderful this will do
[1:39:48] if God permit but get it out of your
[1:39:49] mind that those are the things that we
[1:39:51] seek for
[1:39:53] give this expression it sounds rude but
[1:39:55] I think you all know me well enough to
[1:39:57] know I got no sense to be nice
[1:39:59] amen amen but any hypocrite can come up
[1:40:03] and take the bread in the cup any
[1:40:04] hypocrite can get baptized any hypocrite
[1:40:07] can set in church amen and partake of
[1:40:09] the blessings and the gift of God
[1:40:10] Hebrews 6 tells us so
[1:40:13] what is the manifestation of those sons
[1:40:17] what is that manifestation it's when you
[1:40:21] recognize your true position and
[1:40:24] then by recognizing that position you're
[1:40:28] not looking for any certain thing you
[1:40:31] just know as a son you have a confidence
[1:40:33] as a son that whatever comes your way
[1:40:36] you've got dominion over it
[1:40:40] be it cancer it's tuberculosis be it
[1:40:44] some other Alzheimer's some other kind
[1:40:46] of disease be it some kind of plague
[1:40:48] friends let's just be honest brother
[1:40:50] Brandon told us what these things would
[1:40:52] be he opposed it a quote here there
[1:40:54] today on the internet a few months ago
[1:40:56] when this all first started brother ben
[1:40:57] talked about these plagues falling said
[1:40:59] somebody would run down in their
[1:41:00] basement some would ride in a bomb
[1:41:01] shelters he said they would lock himself
[1:41:03] in their house put a mask on and put
[1:41:06] some disinfectant on it he said still
[1:41:08] won't make no difference you got to be
[1:41:09] born again
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:12] thrown off on brother branham he saw a
[1:41:14] lot more of that little kentucky and saw
[1:41:16] a lot more than what they gave him
[1:41:17] credit for
[1:41:18] and he told us in the last day that they
[1:41:20] would break this germ warfare out on the
[1:41:22] people of god
[1:41:24] so what is our ambition to rally up the
[1:41:27] spiritual muster to be able to go out
[1:41:29] there and say glory to god we're gonna
[1:41:31] take over coronavirus in the name of
[1:41:33] jesus it goes away
[1:41:36] well that'd be wonderful to you get your
[1:41:38] name on the front page CNN fox the rest
[1:41:41] of night might might tell your story
[1:41:43] right they might do it just by chance
[1:41:45] they might tell the truth about your
[1:41:47] story it may be
[1:41:51] but the fact of the matter is that's not
[1:41:54] what we seek for
[1:41:56] seek for the revelation of sonship is
[1:42:01] my position in the body of Christ and
[1:42:05] what does that look like and as a son
[1:42:07] when something comes to me or crosses my
[1:42:11] path in some way as a son or a daughter
[1:42:13] of God I've got authority over that
[1:42:15] thing
[1:42:16] [Applause]
[1:42:17] cancer comes in my body I can dismiss it
[1:42:20] I just miss you in the name of Jesus
[1:42:22] Christ leave my body
[1:42:24] huh that's what brother Brent
[1:42:27] all right so the mystery of God's will
[1:42:30] was in sonship right to understand what
[1:42:34] we are everything travels in threes
[1:42:36] right everything runs in threes and I
[1:42:39] remember he comes the first time to
[1:42:41] redeem he comes the second time to claim
[1:42:44] he comes the third time to
[1:42:49] restore this iteration takes place in
[1:42:53] the aged by the word but for the
[1:42:55] Millennium the righteous will walk out
[1:42:57] on the ashes of the wicked and the third
[1:42:59] coming everything dies during that time
[1:43:02] of the tribulation everything goes down
[1:43:04] and the sons of God will step back upon
[1:43:07] this earth in psalm 37:11 the meek shall
[1:43:11] inherit the earth
[1:43:13] and that tells us that our inheritance
[1:43:16] then of what we gain of what we are
[1:43:18] given watch us now it isn't that I'm a
[1:43:22] son because I've got the earth
[1:43:25] listen to me this is what the Lord
[1:43:27] showed me a little bit ago and I tell
[1:43:29] you like to torment on pieces it's not
[1:43:31] that I've got the earth that I'm a son
[1:43:33] but because I'm a son I've got the earth
[1:43:39] it's not that I've got healing that
[1:43:42] makes me a son it's because I'm a son
[1:43:45] I've got healing
[1:43:47] talked about it he said any prostitute
[1:43:50] could walk up through the prayer line
[1:43:51] and it was simple faith believe God and
[1:43:53] be healed walk off maybe a greater thing
[1:43:55] would come on and later many of those
[1:43:56] people walk to brother Mannis pray line
[1:43:58] didn't always stay healed friends some
[1:44:00] of the people lost their faith went
[1:44:02] right back out into sin and everything
[1:44:03] else in the world not everybody kept
[1:44:04] their healing but don't forget brother
[1:44:06] sister the Spirit of God that lives and
[1:44:09] abides inside of your heart it is not
[1:44:12] healing or salvation or whatever that
[1:44:14] makes you a son because you are sons
[1:44:17] will Riddick garden hallelujah and
[1:44:19] hallelujah he said he sent forth spirit
[1:44:22] into your heart crying Abba Father
[1:44:25] because you are son
[1:44:29] soulful weaken an ultra generation goes
[1:44:31] around looking for signs well they're
[1:44:33] gonna be in trouble
[1:44:36] a
[1:44:38] lot of trouble
[1:44:41] so well glory to god I've got healing
[1:44:43] power look here look here oil running
[1:44:45] from my hands
[1:44:47] they said it said brother man talk about
[1:44:50] blood running from their forehead I
[1:44:52] didn't have nothing to do with sonship
[1:44:54] common faith can produce them things
[1:44:58] sure can common faith can produce divine
[1:45:01] healing
[1:45:02] or God honors faith are you it
[1:45:07] odd honors faith God will honor your
[1:45:09] faith anybody's faith don't matter who
[1:45:10] it is if they believe God he'll honor
[1:45:12] their faith that'll make him a son
[1:45:16] mmm that'll make him a son right now

[1:51:27] and you you understand it wasn't the
[1:51:32] blessings that made Abraham Abraham it
[1:51:36] was Abraham that made the blessings
[1:51:41] I've said this many times about a son of
[1:51:44] God and the daughter of God going
[1:51:45] through troubles they say oh I'm going
[1:51:47] through the greatest battle I've ever
[1:51:48] been in my life
[1:51:49] what am I going to do I said remember
[1:51:51] that you were a son and a daughter going
[1:51:53] through the greatest battle you've ever
[1:51:55] gone through in your life
[1:51:56] you're a son going through a fight it
[1:52:00] everybody going through a battle you're
[1:52:02] a son going through a battle and when a
[1:52:05] son goes through a battle the devil's
[1:52:07] got something on his hands now
[1:52:09] well yeah we get weak we get discouraged
[1:52:12] we get does all that kind of stuff like
[1:52:13] that you get depressed you get worried

[1:52:36] mannequin
[1:52:38] how about I get talking this way and
[1:52:40] it's just hard to hold back
[1:52:43] yes sir he got his position after the
[1:52:46] battle was over all right the mystery of
[1:52:48] his will
[1:52:49] all right look in that verse 9
[1:52:52] remember in the dispensation of the
[1:52:54] fullness of time now watch but them said
[1:52:56] now we learn the fullness of time is
[1:52:58] waiting for what the fullness of all
[1:53:02] time is the time that sin will cease
[1:53:05] death will cease sickness will cease
[1:53:08] time will cease and I can't wait for it
[1:53:12] to get there
[1:53:15] somebody said I run out of time I said
[1:53:17] that's the whole purpose of serving God
[1:53:19] one of these days I'm hoping to run
[1:53:20] completely out of time into eternity
[1:53:21] heaven
[1:53:24] the time on all perversions and
[1:53:26] perverted things that the devil
[1:53:28] perverted will cease when time itself
[1:53:31] shall cease and inheritance somebody had
[1:53:34] to leave you something in order for it
[1:53:37] to be an inheritance he said now I
[1:53:39] didn't have any myself but God left me
[1:53:41] an inheritance when he put my name on
[1:53:43] the Lamb's Book of Life for the
[1:53:44] foundation of the world now Jesus come
[1:53:46] to purchase that inheritance he that's
[1:53:48] the logos that went out of God was the
[1:53:51] son of God made man that little God
[1:53:53] that's right he said then he said now he
[1:53:58] said I made you a god Moses he said
[1:54:00] Aaron's your prophet he said who I may
[1:54:02] act like a religious crepe but I'm not
[1:54:04] he said when your eyes come open to see
[1:54:07] those things he said all right he made
[1:54:10] man of God
[1:54:11] see a God in his domain and his domain
[1:54:15] goes from sea to sea from shore to shore
[1:54:18] he has control of it and
[1:54:21] Jesus proved it
[1:54:24] when the winds blow D said peace be
[1:54:27] still
[1:54:29] when he come to the trees said no man
[1:54:31] shall eat from you verily that's little
[1:54:33] gods you say to this mountain be moved
[1:54:36] on doubt in your heart believe what you
[1:54:37] said it shall come to pass and then
[1:54:39] maybe I could get a rebirth Brennan said
[1:54:41] Jesus when he was here on earth he was
[1:54:42] an example of what God will be when he
[1:54:45] returns in his son Christ Jesus when
[1:54:47] Jesus returns that's right
[1:54:51] then you have an idea if you know what
[1:54:53] he was then oh my then you have an idea
[1:54:57] of what he's gonna be today
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:01] example a pothead
[1:55:05] that's right when he was on earth as the
[1:55:07] son of God he was the first indwelling
[1:55:10] with the holy spirit did you know that
[1:55:12] Jesus was the first mortal to end well
[1:55:15] the Holy Spirit
[1:55:18] well that quad was poured into Christ
[1:55:21] not to gods
[1:55:22] no no not to but God manifests in the
[1:55:25] flesh Saint John 3:16 parallels and
[1:55:30] manifests first John 1st Timothy 3:16
[1:55:32] for God so loved the world he gave
[1:55:35] parallels and connects completely with
[1:55:38] 1st Timothy 3:16 for God was manifested
[1:55:41] in the flesh
[1:55:43] well who else was it God
[1:55:45] the fullness of Godhead body was in him
[1:55:48] so if Jesus by his sonship Oh once you
[1:55:53] don't don't fail this what I'm getting
[1:55:54] ready to say to you this is a beautiful
[1:55:55] little things will stick out here now if
[1:55:57] Jesus when he comes there in mark
[1:55:59] chapter 4 verses 36 through 39 if you
[1:56:02] want to look at it later when the great
[1:56:03] storm arises Jesus stands out on the bow
[1:56:06] the ship rebukes the wind and the wind
[1:56:10] ceases and there's a great calm in mark
[1:56:13] chapter 11 that's verses 12 13 and 14
[1:56:16] and then verses 19 through 23 he comes
[1:56:21] to this tree and curses it I noticed the
[1:56:24] focus of this revelation wasn't upon the
[1:56:27] miracle of the act that Jesus did why
[1:56:30] did the wind obey Jesus oh
[1:56:34] I hope you're here man
[1:56:38] cos he was a son
[1:56:44] and not just a son but these hallelujah
[1:56:50] why did that tree go out there and speak
[1:56:53] to that tree right now what Renekton the
[1:56:55] church go speak to tree slap it on the
[1:56:57] side of the Barkers and I curse you
[1:57:00] my little trees say look you you might
[1:57:03] thank you something but I listening
[1:57:07] it doesn't obey this part this part a
[1:57:09] what we're talking about no no but why
[1:57:12] did the tree the chemical reaction the
[1:57:15] chemistry of that tree changed
[1:57:20] son of God why Jesus was a son
[1:57:26] it comes with the son's life
[1:57:29] spoke power spoken were thority that
[1:57:32] comes with the sons life
[1:57:35] healing dynamics to raise the dead that
[1:57:37] comes with the son's life that's just a
[1:57:42] sight that's what a human does speech
[1:57:46] that's what a human does
[1:57:48] reproduction that's what the human life
[1:57:50] does eat it's what humans do sleep
[1:57:53] that's what humans do cast out Devils
[1:57:56] it's what sons do a
[1:58:00] Medic part of the son life
[1:58:03] and it's not because I do these things
[1:58:05] that makes me a son it's because I'm a
[1:58:08] son that these things follow me
[1:58:12] well I love this in queen of sheba
[1:58:15] brother brems said now what does he do
[1:58:19] yeah he doesn't give man power to heal
[1:58:22] neither to save no man can forgive your
[1:58:25] sins it's already said forgiven you just
[1:58:27] have to accept your pardon no man can
[1:58:29] heal you
[1:58:30] God has already did it you just have to
[1:58:33] accept it so that tells us that it's not
[1:58:35] in the flesh of this thing oh you said
[1:58:38] well I was born a Branham or I was born
[1:58:40] a coffee or born in nor odd or born a
[1:58:41] lush or whatever I was I because I come
[1:58:44] from a good family because I've got a
[1:58:46] church background that ain't got nothing
[1:58:48] to do with nothing we know that we know
[1:58:50] that that's not the part that does the
[1:58:52] healing this is only the instrument that
[1:58:55] packs the Esso in around
[1:59:00] let me see the real me
[1:59:04] you're looking at my face of what you
[1:59:06] say has been Nora but the real me is a
[1:59:08] whole lot different than what this look
[1:59:10] on the outside is
[1:59:12] and me ain't got no bald spot on the
[1:59:15] back of his head that's one thing I'm
[1:59:16] thankful about this camera look at me in
[1:59:17] the face you don't get to see my bald
[1:59:19] spot this time around hallelujah praise
[1:59:20] the Lord for that I think I kind of like
[1:59:23] that hey hey man I used to have hair I
[1:59:27] don't know where it went though hey man
[1:59:29] I had nieces I guess and children
[1:59:32] all right now the Pool of Bethesda
[1:59:34] brother Brennan said now our Heavenly
[1:59:36] Father you said whatsoever you bind on
[1:59:38] earth will be bound in heaven
[1:59:39] you believe that
[1:59:42] whatever you loose on earth will be
[1:59:45] loosed in heaven Lord that's in your
[1:59:46] word whatever sins you remit they're
[1:59:49] remitted
[1:59:50] whoever sins you retain they are
[1:59:52] retained that's what you promised
[1:59:55] you said now in obedience to your word I
[1:59:58] lay my hands upon my sister and bless
[2:00:01] her and to loose her
[2:00:04] from this trouble
[2:00:06] now that that sounds good that
[2:00:11] how comes sickness is obeyed
[2:00:15] why were they obeying the voice of a
[2:00:18] little Kentuckian all the branham's died
[2:00:21] with their boots on so what what
[2:00:22] difference did this Brenda make from
[2:00:24] another Branham
[2:00:25] hmm
[2:00:27] one was the Sun and
[2:00:30] one recognized his sonship may remember
[2:00:33] that when Jesus said whoever sins you
[2:00:35] remit their remitted whoever sins you
[2:00:36] retain their retain we have been given
[2:00:39] the ability to remit sins you know where
[2:00:41] that happens don't you in the baptismal
[2:00:43] pool
[2:00:44] and when we bury him in the water
[2:00:46] brother Gerald we lay them down and say
[2:00:48] i baptize you according to Jesus in the
[2:00:50] name of the Father the Son the Holy
[2:00:51] Ghost which revealed to us by Simon
[2:00:53] Peter is the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:55] Christ i baptize you for the remission
[2:00:57] of your sins
[2:01:01] and what does that a son
[2:01:04] even but she tells us in spoken words
[2:01:07] original seed that life is passed
[2:01:10] through the body
[2:01:12] did you know you have the ability to
[2:01:14] pass eternal life from one person to
[2:01:16] another
[2:01:18] that's right you eat that big apple or
[2:01:21] that orange or that banana whatever you
[2:01:22] get where do you all reckon that come
[2:01:24] from it comes from the body
[2:01:27] when I was down to Nicaragua my first
[2:01:29] time I saw them big old banana trees and
[2:01:31] in boys climbing up there barefooted and
[2:01:33] I'm big hatchet on their back and they
[2:01:35] climbed at the top men whacking big
[2:01:37] stalks of bananas they drop down
[2:01:39] somebody catching them at the bottom
[2:01:40] with a big net like this and I looked at
[2:01:43] that big old tree they were climbing up
[2:01:45] through there and I thought yeah that's
[2:01:46] right that's the body that the life had
[2:01:49] to pass through that body in order for
[2:01:50] us to be able to enjoy that banana
[2:01:53] where does he turn a life pass today
[2:01:56] comes to you I
[2:01:58] listen why
[2:02:00] because you are a son
[2:02:03] that's where life comes from o
[2:02:06] all-praised
[2:02:09] amen if a dog produces a dog and a cat
[2:02:12] produces a cat tell me what a son
[2:02:14] produces
[2:02:16] and what God produces
[2:02:19] Jesus Christ I
[2:02:22] Paul said the Christ be formed in you
[2:02:25] amen I hope I born you
[2:02:31] a
[2:02:32] mat now watch now and in in st. John
[2:02:36] chapter 9 verse 1 Jesus passes by and
[2:02:39] sees a man blind from birth all right
[2:02:42] the disciples asked him who sinned
[2:02:46] they said neither not the man not the
[2:02:49] parents but that the works of God should
[2:02:53] be made manifest in him now watch this
[2:02:54] in verse verse
[2:02:56] 4 he said I must work the works of him
[2:02:59] that sent me
[2:03:01] while it is day the night cometh when no
[2:03:04] man can work as long as I am in the
[2:03:07] world I am the light of the world now
[2:03:10] watch what Jesus is saying the reason
[2:03:13] that this miracle is getting ready to
[2:03:15] take place is because as a son I am here
[2:03:20] to spread light sunlight in a dark age
[2:03:24] that's why it was doing the things he's
[2:03:26] doing look the lame didn't leap like a
[2:03:28] heart and the blind eyes come open and
[2:03:30] that's what made Jesus a son it's
[2:03:32] because Jesus was a son that the lame
[2:03:34] leap like a heart blinded eyes come open
[2:03:36] he was the light of the age
[2:03:39] Amen I think you're understanding the
[2:03:41] point I'm trying to bring to you right
[2:03:44] now now we see now that then the Holy
[2:03:47] Spirit I'm just gonna go just a little
[2:03:48] bit further we're gonna quit and save
[2:03:50] some of this for tomorrow night because
[2:03:52] we got we got a whole lot more here a
[2:03:54] lot of hay on the fort well I've been
[2:03:56] doing a lot of study and then get ready
[2:03:57] for this and I'm really excited about
[2:03:59] the next couple of days amen but now
[2:04:02] perfect strength he talks about now you
[2:04:04] Catholic people that's what remission of
[2:04:06] sin is you say the church has the power
[2:04:08] to remit sins he said how did the church
[2:04:11] remit sins Jesus didn't tell the church
[2:04:14] whoever sins you admit their remitted
[2:04:16] whoever you retain the root end retained
[2:04:18] but how did they remit the first the
[2:04:20] sins in the early church they called
[2:04:22] them to repentance and they baptize them
[2:04:26] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:04:27] mission of sins not under a confession
[2:04:29] booth
[2:04:31] but they repented before God in their
[2:04:34] heart and when they were standing there
[2:04:36] they believed and what did the Bible say
[2:04:41] to as many as believed are you already a
[2:04:47] v-power
[2:04:48] [Applause]
[2:04:53] to come the sons of God
[2:04:56] right that's how the church remit sins
[2:05:00] if I want to remit your sins I give you
[2:05:03] the power to become a son of God that's
[2:05:05] how I bring you to remittance
[2:05:07] now the Catholic people they bring them
[2:05:09] in a booth and set them down and say now
[2:05:11] my son tell me your wrongs and how many
[2:05:14] video games did you play this week and
[2:05:16] how many cuss words did you say and how
[2:05:18] many cigarettes did you smoke and what
[2:05:20] all did you do they matter whatever it
[2:05:21] might have been some little thing all
[2:05:24] right say 100 Hail Marys and go on about
[2:05:25] your way your sins are remitted
[2:05:28] but all of that is nice as it may sound
[2:05:30] to the human conscience it doesn't give
[2:05:33] power Amen it doesn't get power to
[2:05:36] become a Sun
[2:05:38] what does the elect of God do for those
[2:05:42] that are sons
[2:05:43] give other sons the power to become sons
[2:05:47] oh
[2:05:49] it's just as perfect just as plain as
[2:05:52] the nose on your face if you want to see
[2:05:56] that's what all this preaching is about
[2:05:58] this is the reason we preach the way we
[2:06:01] preach it's not to stand up here and
[2:06:03] educate people the purpose of preaching
[2:06:05] is to give sons the power to become a
[2:06:08] son
[2:06:10] the neck
[2:06:12] not not you said well we'll play a tape
[2:06:15] that might be all right the tape was
[2:06:17] given as as a support as a voice for us
[2:06:23] to take that voice and start breaking it
[2:06:26] down into a manner that we can give the
[2:06:28] sons the tools they need to win it if we
[2:06:31] leave them to their own devices let them
[2:06:33] try to figure it on their own rather
[2:06:35] let's just be honest you can hand some
[2:06:37] people a tent give them instructions
[2:06:40] give them a box give them poles give
[2:06:42] them steaks ask him to set it up in 45
[2:06:45] minutes they've tangled up and they got
[2:06:47] their head wrapped that thing's wrapped
[2:06:48] around their head that they're choking
[2:06:50] to death they've done messed it all
[2:06:51] can't follow the directions and
[2:06:54] then we're gonna hand people's push play
[2:06:56] on a tape recorder and expect people to
[2:06:58] figure out how to become sons
[2:07:01] well some people can't walk and chew gum
[2:07:03] at the same time come on somebody
[2:07:06] huh come on preach to me a minute
[2:07:09] [Applause]
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:11] some people can't even tie their
[2:07:12] shoelaces and yet we're gonna just play
[2:07:15] them a tape and all of a sudden they're
[2:07:16] gonna become sons hogwash nonsense trash
[2:07:20] on me right at the devil lies
[2:07:23] that's why the fivefold ministry brings
[2:07:26] the word in such a manner that we can
[2:07:28] take that voice that voice of God now
[2:07:31] not compromise that our muddy it up say
[2:07:33] it like you said it but take the word
[2:07:35] and apply it to the son's life where
[2:07:37] they can have power themself to become a
[2:07:40] son look sister you sitting out there
[2:07:42] you're not interested in the quotes
[2:07:45] about Rick Etta you're not interested in
[2:07:47] the quotes about rock and roll strip
[2:07:48] teasers and things like that you can
[2:07:50] hear brother branham say those things
[2:07:52] but and you can say man to them but they
[2:07:54] don't apply to you in 2020
[2:07:58] though them sons getting up and just
[2:08:01] reading them quotes like that well I'm
[2:08:02] just gonna read it we've got a lot of
[2:08:04] good professional quotas in this message
[2:08:06] they go their professional quotas
[2:08:09] they sure are they know how to break
[2:08:11] quote that word boy what good does it do
[2:08:14] you if you don't give the people the
[2:08:15] power to become a son I
[2:08:18] like that I like that I don't matter to
[2:08:22] me what y'all think I like it they
[2:08:25] love you but I like it I do okay I don't
[2:08:29] know so much about that well you might
[2:08:31] be disagreeing that's all right maybe
[2:08:32] not you hear the invisible audience hear
[2:08:34] me you may not agree with some of that
[2:08:36] well brother been the real voice of God
[2:08:38] as I heard some poor fellas saying here
[2:08:40] the other day we these preachers he said
[2:08:42] need to have the strength to let the
[2:08:45] voice speak in the platform well that's
[2:08:46] what I do every time I preach I
[2:08:49] let the voice do some talking every time
[2:08:52] I talk
[2:08:53] that's why we pray and bow our heads say
[2:08:55] father bless the speaker and the
[2:08:57] listener because we're hoping the voice
[2:08:58] the voice
[2:09:00] gives us the power to become sons I
[2:09:06] mean what good does it do us to throw
[2:09:09] all these quotes and scriptures together
[2:09:11] if what we're reading and what we're
[2:09:12] talking about doesn't give you the power
[2:09:14] to become the son
[2:09:16] I
[2:09:17] think about a church let people get sick
[2:09:20] in the hospital
[2:09:21] what we gonna do walking in with a
[2:09:23] sealed book laid on their arm and say
[2:09:25] praise the Lord the first horse rider
[2:09:26] was the devil I rise and be healed
[2:09:30] I'm not throwing off but those are just
[2:09:33] words and
[2:09:35] remember there was a warning brother
[2:09:37] branham give every one of us that the
[2:09:39] Word of God must be positioned in its
[2:09:41] right place we can't disjoint it
[2:09:44] so just reading it word verbatim and
[2:09:47] saying exactly what the Prophet said
[2:09:48] that's wonderful thank God for it we
[2:09:50] want to listen to that voice and hear
[2:09:52] what that prophet said no preacher in
[2:09:54] this message is ever gonna have the
[2:09:56] authority above this message but our job
[2:09:59] is to give you power how delue you to
[2:10:01] become a son of God and if you're the
[2:10:04] ability to take that sonship and make it
[2:10:07] work in your daily life
[2:10:10] yes sir
[2:10:12] all right that day on Calvary what is he
[2:10:15] turn a life he said the life that he
[2:10:17] lived the life that was in him impart
[2:10:19] that to others
[2:10:21] can a man do that oh
[2:10:24] brother man I wish you had this quote to
[2:10:26] put up where everybody could see this I
[2:10:28] I should have give it to you somehow
[2:10:30] another but anyways he said a son of God
[2:10:33] can
[2:10:37] what is eternal life the life that he
[2:10:40] lived
[2:10:41] the life that was in him impart that to
[2:10:45] others
[2:10:46] I'm gonna get it again just so you catch
[2:10:48] it can a man do that
[2:10:50] big question mark a son of God Kenny
[2:10:54] says
[2:10:57] Jesus said whoever sins you remit to
[2:11:01] them they are remitted whoever sins you
[2:11:03] retain to them they are retained
[2:11:06] he said that's where the Catholic Church
[2:11:08] I mean these others made their big
[2:11:09] mistake go out and say I forgive sins
[2:11:11] that wasn't it well then what was it
[2:11:13] rather random it was to be able to go
[2:11:16] out and call them to repentance
[2:11:18] take them to the water and baptize them
[2:11:21] in Jesus name and to them that believed
[2:11:24] Givi power to become the sons of God
[2:11:28] give you power to become sons that is
[2:11:31] the purpose of the Ministry of Malachi
[2:11:33] for that was the purpose of the message
[2:11:35] of the hour all together was to give us
[2:11:37] the ability to become sons
[2:11:41] what good the opening of the seals that
[2:11:43] the opening of the seals doesn't
[2:11:45] position you as a son right
[2:11:48] Peter answered that question on the day
[2:11:50] of Pentecost about how they get their
[2:11:52] sins forgiven the Bible what can we do
[2:11:54] to be saved he laid down the
[2:11:56] prescription repent every one of you be
[2:11:57] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he
[2:11:59] said there's the greater works
[2:12:02] I
[2:12:03] hope you didn't miss that
[2:12:06] there's the greater works that's what
[2:12:09] the preachers business to do
[2:12:12] well if you want to know what kind of
[2:12:14] business I'm in I'm in this business
[2:12:17] giving sons power I'm in the son given
[2:12:21] power business
[2:12:23] son given power to other sons
[2:12:25] incorporated
[2:12:30] praise the Lord
[2:12:32] yes sir that's right for them to repent
[2:12:35] to be baptized for the remission of
[2:12:37] their sins a little bit father won't
[2:12:38] quit alright because we've been going
[2:12:39] whole service beginning being here a
[2:12:41] couple hours and I don't want to wear
[2:12:42] yak because I know you got one time
[2:12:44] tomorrow alright whoever sins you
[2:12:46] forgive I'll forgive them to whoever
[2:12:47] sins you do not forgive
[2:12:50] hold it against them I'll hold it
[2:12:53] against them to that's what Jesus said
[2:12:55] that's right so in other words now watch
[2:12:58] coming to the third pool preach into the
[2:13:00] eternal Lost
[2:13:01] the church has the power to hold the
[2:13:04] sins against them how
[2:13:06] when they're called to repentance and
[2:13:09] they won't repent
[2:13:12] the church holds it against them
[2:13:16] what do y'all think is going to happen
[2:13:18] on the day of judgment consider this for
[2:13:21] a minute when they stand up around the
[2:13:23] day of judgment and we're called to the
[2:13:25] attorney box and the voice is played of
[2:13:27] repentance and preaching going forth to
[2:13:29] get himself right with God are you go
[2:13:32] Walker so no Lord they didn't mean to do
[2:13:33] it no no because they rejected truth in
[2:13:37] the hour of mercy that they had to
[2:13:39] receive it to receive mercy received the
[2:13:41] Lord in the time that you're supposed to
[2:13:42] be able to receive because they rejected
[2:13:44] him at that time then the church holds
[2:13:46] the sin against them I
[2:13:50] can't give you power to become a son of
[2:13:53] God you will repent
[2:13:57] you see it
[2:14:00] now you see what a place this third pool
[2:14:02] is will will preach to those that can
[2:14:04] not be saved you see why it is
[2:14:06] because the father's business of the
[2:14:09] last days gives sons power to become
[2:14:10] sons those that will not receive that
[2:14:13] power we hold that unbelief against them
[2:14:15] remember you have to be a guardian to
[2:14:18] the Tree of Life you have to guard the
[2:14:20] Word of God you cannot stand out there

[2:14:43] whoever sins you retain their retained
[2:14:45] [Applause]
[2:14:47] that's right now that's hard I know we

[2:14:54] one line or preaching bride's bride and
[2:14:55] gonna make it in heaven hallelujah new
[2:14:57] glory to God but there's a Judgment Day

[2:15:20] and be all right
[2:15:24] hallelu just blame it on a power outage
[2:15:26] or something like that you know I I
[2:15:27] don't know
[2:15:29] if you want to do baby watch here in
[2:15:33] Acts chapter 5 verse 1
[2:15:35] but a certain man named Ananias and
[2:15:38] Sapphira
[2:15:40] mmm-hmm see where we're gone
[2:15:44] sold a possession and kept back part of
[2:15:46] the price
[2:15:47] his wife is also being privy to it
[2:15:51] brought a certain part late at the
[2:15:52] Apostles feet but Peter said Ananias why
[2:15:55] has Satan filled thine heart to lie to
[2:15:57] the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of
[2:15:59] the price of the land why is it remained
[2:16:02] was not a tyonne and after it was sold
[2:16:04] was it not thine own power why stop
[2:16:07] conceived as staying in nine heart now
[2:16:09] it's not lied unto men but unto God in a
[2:16:13] nice here in the words brother member
[2:16:14] sakhi that was so great it caused him to
[2:16:16] have a massive heart attack right on the
[2:16:17] spot
[2:16:20] very soon the whole
[2:16:24] and he fell down and gave up the ghost
[2:16:29] now watching great fear came on all of
[2:16:32] them that heard those things then verse
[2:16:35] 9 how is it they have agreed together to
[2:16:37] tempt the Spirit of the Lord behold the
[2:16:40] feet of them which have buried thy
[2:16:41] husband at the door and they would carry
[2:16:42] the out straightway she yielded up the
[2:16:44] ghost
[2:16:46] all right now that's the son that's a
[2:16:49] son in action retaining the sin you
[2:16:53] won't repent you wouldn't do right now
[2:16:55] if you read the verses right before that
[2:16:57] fifth chapter there you'll find out that
[2:16:59] there's a man right there in the Bible
[2:17:01] right just right before these verses
[2:17:03] kick in within and Isis of Sephora right
[2:17:05] where Luke the writer drops right into
[2:17:07] that about look at them last verses
[2:17:08] right before that chapter where the man
[2:17:11] that he refers to
[2:17:12] III was trying to think of his name
[2:17:14] anyhow I was looking at the other day
[2:17:16] but he goes in and says how that he's
[2:17:18] sold and says it a couple of times I
[2:17:20] sold and gave his possession out for the
[2:17:22] disciples and then immediately here
[2:17:25] comes this in chapter 5 with Ananias and
[2:17:27] so far they kept a part of it back
[2:17:30] showing that whatever sin was retained
[2:17:32] it would be retained alright next
[2:17:35] chapter 13 verse 7 they're in the
[2:17:38] country the deputy of the country is
[2:17:40] sega's paulius a prudent man who called
[2:17:43] for Barnabas and Saul and desired to
[2:17:44] hear the word of God but elements the
[2:17:46] sorcerer for so was his name my
[2:17:47] interpretation withstood them seeking to
[2:17:49] turn away the deputy from the faith then
[2:17:52] Saul who is also called Paul filled with
[2:17:54] the Holy Ghost watch now said eyes on
[2:17:57] him amen the Sun set his eyes on another
[2:18:00] one
[2:18:01] and said all full of all subtility and
[2:18:05] all mischief now child of the devil
[2:18:08] well what have they been sitting there
[2:18:10] with her video camera their telephone in
[2:18:13] her hand taking this and putting it on
[2:18:14] Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and
[2:18:16] all the rest and there'd be millions of
[2:18:18] YouTube comments who gives this man a
[2:18:20] right to call him a child of the devil I
[2:18:22] tell you we'd give him a ride he was a
[2:18:24] son
[2:18:25] and as son he was promised by Jesus
[2:18:29] whoever sins you retain they are
[2:18:30] retained
[2:18:33] seed our child of the devil verse 10 now
[2:18:35] enemy of all righteousness well thou not
[2:18:38] cease to pervert the right ways of the
[2:18:40] Lord and now I behold the hand of the
[2:18:43] Lord is upon thee and thou shall be
[2:18:44] blind not seeing the Sun for a season
[2:18:48] and
[2:18:49] immediately there fell on a mist in a
[2:18:51] darkness and it went about seeking some
[2:18:53] to leave him by the hand and the deputy
[2:18:54] when he saw what was done believed being
[2:18:56] astonished at the doctrine of the Lord
[2:19:00] what did it a son retained
[2:19:05] son retained the sins and then Paul says
[2:19:09] again in first Corinthians chapter 3
[2:19:10] verse 21 therefore let no man glory and
[2:19:13] men for all things are yours praise Lord
[2:19:16] whether Paul or Apollo's are safe Cephas
[2:19:19] or the world or life or death or the
[2:19:21] things present or things to come I like
[2:19:23] that all are yours
[2:19:26] and here we go and ye are Christ's and
[2:19:31] Christ
[2:19:32] is God
[2:19:34] [Applause]
[2:19:34] [Laughter]
[2:19:41] praising
[2:19:43] everything who's he talking to brother
[2:19:47] Gerald son
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:19:53] sons with full power you see this is the
[2:19:56] hour that the mystery the will of God is
[2:19:58] being revealed to us what was the
[2:20:01] opening of the seven seas let me say
[2:20:02] quickly and then is quit the opening of
[2:20:05] the seven seals very simply put was
[2:20:07] showing the position of the true
[2:20:11] manifested sons of the last day
[2:20:15] position in the word you
[2:20:18] remember last time I was there we talked
[2:20:20] about all those positions and things
[2:20:22] remember we talked about the future
[2:20:23] events last year and if you recall
[2:20:26] remember I told you at the opening of
[2:20:28] the seals you probably remember me
[2:20:29] remarking if you don't let me repeat it
[2:20:32] briefly but you remember remarket how
[2:20:34] that when the seals come open look how
[2:20:35] everything found its position now
[2:20:38] brother Brenham tied a lot of loose ends
[2:20:40] together Charles taze Russell
[2:20:41] talked about you know the hundred and
[2:20:44] forty-four thousand and these other
[2:20:45] things like that but yet when the seals
[2:20:47] come open look how brother bran plays
[2:20:49] 144,000
[2:20:50] it was them Jews
[2:20:53] that remnant that's left here in the
[2:20:55] tribulation that will received a message
[2:20:56] than two prophets look at the foolish
[2:20:58] Spurgeon I call you no more Church he
[2:21:00] said I call you bride there's a church
[2:21:01] and then there's a bride
[2:21:04] even those kind and good to the Brethren
[2:21:06] even those living outside the city the
[2:21:09] nation's that stand for Israel they got
[2:21:11] a place and look at all these positions
[2:21:13] starting to fall in their place well if
[2:21:16] Israel knows who she is brother Gerald
[2:21:18] and if the rest I don't know who they
[2:21:20] are by the bomb then shouldn't also in
[2:21:22] the revelation of the will of God
[2:21:24] shouldn't there also be the revelation
[2:21:26] glory to God a
[2:21:28] food then sons are as well I
[2:21:33] tell you yen a man
[2:21:36] position of the sons has been revealed
[2:21:39] so you see it's like a great puzzle
[2:21:42] God in his way
[2:21:45] slowly unfolded the mystery of it Jesus
[2:21:48] made up a portion of the puzzle and all
[2:21:51] the pieces that made up his hour
[2:21:53] but then God finished it off by allowing
[2:21:57] the sons to find their position in the
[2:21:59] great economy of God and because you are
[2:22:02] sons will open with that tomorrow night
[2:22:04] the Lord will unless he changes my heart
[2:22:05] on it will open tomorrow night because
[2:22:07] you are sons
[2:22:08] he sends in his spirit crying Abba
[2:22:11] Father I want to take that and go a
[2:22:12] whole different direction try to expound
[2:22:14] and get a little deeper on some of these
[2:22:16] things because as you know Friday night
[2:22:17] we just lay the foundation on a couple
[2:22:19] of things to get the get the motor
[2:22:21] running and get the engine hot hey
[2:22:24] hallelujah
[2:22:26] but because you are sons
[2:22:29] Amen why does the church retain what
[2:22:32] gives me the right to stand at judgment
[2:22:34] say thus and though and though and
[2:22:35] though what gives me the right I'm a son
[2:22:39] you walk into a business and that man
[2:22:41] walks over and says you're fired get
[2:22:43] your stuff and get out of here well
[2:22:45] somebody could retort back what gives
[2:22:46] you the right he's the owner of the
[2:22:48] business
[2:22:50] it's business he owns it he's got a
[2:22:53] right
