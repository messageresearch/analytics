[45:59] the righteous run into it and they are
[46:01] saved
[46:03] and Lord we know there's no name given
[46:05] on Earth or under Heaven by which men
[46:07] can be saved except that of the Lord
[46:09] Jesus Christ
[46:10] and Lord we're gathered here in that
[46:12] name today
[46:14] Lord as Christians we're identified with
[46:16] Christ we are christ-like and it's
[46:18] because of your goodness and your grace
[46:20] Lord your life-changing power Lord that

[46:30] Lord and then you did a work in our
[46:32] lives that made us live a life that was
[46:34] pleasing to you
[46:36] but Lord we're not out of here yet
[46:39] and so we've come in once again Lord to
[46:41] hear your word

[46:45] correct us Lord to draw us closer to you
[46:47] Heavenly Father Lord to make the very
[46:50] shine and draw of this world just fade

[47:09] turn to Second Timothy chapter four
[47:13] and we welcome sister Delfina back from
[47:15] her trip to Alberta
[47:17] for the Chad's here on a Wednesday night
[47:19] praise the lord it's a rare treat it's
[47:21] funny Wednesdays usually is when we have
[47:23] our least and I think that's the most
[47:24] we've had in a while just with the
[47:26] different things travel and sickness and
[47:28] whatnot so it's good to have him here
[47:30] and then of course we've got sister
[47:31] Betty sitting back there as well so
[47:33] praise the lord it's good to see her and
[47:35] brother Gerald with her amen I believe
[47:37] they announced that brother Dwayne Fair
[47:39] will be here next weekend and it's his
[47:41] anniversary weekend he or week he's
[47:43] coming in on his anniversary and he was
[47:44] hoping to get somewhat of a break
[47:47] so I said how many are you willing to do
[47:49] how many services will you preach he
[47:50] says I'm your servant I'll preach as
[47:52] many as you want and I said you'll
[47:53] preach three services
[47:55] so I took full advantage of that it's
[47:57] been about six months since we've been
[47:58] able to bring somebody in so I believe
[48:00] the Lord will bless us with a visiting
[48:02] minister so pray keep him in prayer he's
[48:05] got a lot going on this weekend and then
[48:06] of course he flies out Monday and he's
[48:08] gonna or Tuesday and he'll spend a
[48:10] couple days with his wife here alone and
[48:11] then he'll he'll meet up with us and
[48:13] come Minister but keep him in prayer
[48:15] keep the services in prayer amen that
[48:17] God will just bless and anoint them amen
[48:20] I meant second Timothy 4 verse 2.
[48:24] this is Paul speaking to Timothy he says
[48:26] preach the word be instant in season out
[48:29] of season
[48:30] reprieu reprove rebuke exhort with all
[48:34] suffering and Doctrine for the time
[48:36] shall come when they will not endure
[48:38] sound Doctrine but after their own lust
[48:41] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[48:43] having itching ears and they shall turn
[48:46] away their ears from the truth and shall
[48:48] be turned unto fables amen God bless his
[48:51] word you may be seated amen welcome my
[48:53] friend Roy sitting back there as well it
[48:56] meant good to see him again amen I
[48:58] wasn't quite sure if we were going to
[48:59] take another service on on this little
[49:01] mini-series I've been doing and I had
[49:03] lots of notes but I just wasn't sure and
[49:04] so anyways as I sat down and was praying
[49:07] about it and and just started reading
[49:09] through it I said I just felt led to go
[49:11] in it so we're going to continue this
[49:12] this this and this will be the final
[49:14] service on the characteristics of a
[49:17] seduction and the characteristic
[49:19] characteristics of a seduction and I
[49:21] know last service I shared a lot of
[49:22] things about myself about the calling of
[49:24] the ministry and the the pressures and
[49:26] the influences that can come along those
[49:28] ways and I share those things why so
[49:31] that you understand we're not above it
[49:33] we're not above the seduction of Satan
[49:35] we're not above the seduction of men
[49:36] that were not above these influences
[49:38] that are out there that are trying to
[49:39] get us away from the will and the word
[49:42] of God and he'll do it to each and every
[49:44] one of us and so if he'll do it at the
[49:46] at the minister level he'll do it at the
[49:47] father level he'll do it at the mother
[49:49] level he'll go all the way down to the
[49:51] children he has no no mercy for age or
[49:53] for gender he's looking for every single
[49:55] one that professes who is a Christian
[49:57] and he's going to go for them and he's
[49:58] going to try and get them to get out of
[50:00] that will of God and we know Satan
[50:02] doesn't have to go looking for where we
[50:04] are does he
[50:05] all he has to do is he has to come look
[50:07] where the preaching of the word is and
[50:09] there he knows that in some somewhere in
[50:10] there there's going to be a believer it
[50:12] might not all be Believers but he knows
[50:14] if you're sitting under the preaching of
[50:15] the word somewhere then you're looking
[50:17] to become a Christian or you're looking
[50:18] to be a Christian and so he knows where
[50:20] to place his attack amen listen he
[50:23] doesn't have to wonder who's in and
[50:24] who's out he'll know just by the very
[50:27] attribute of where you're sitting
[50:28] tonight whether you profess to be a real
[50:30] Christian or not it's that simple if
[50:32] Christian will sit under the hearing of
[50:33] the word they've got to because that's
[50:35] how they're fed that's how they they
[50:36] grow in Grace and these different things
[50:39] but I want you to understand something
[50:41] that when you come in these doors
[50:42] potentially this is where you'll face
[50:45] some of the biggest attacks
[50:47] Satan is here in every service trying to
[50:50] distract you trying to get you to twist
[50:52] something trying to get you offended at
[50:54] something trying to get you bothered by
[50:55] something trying to distract you from
[50:57] getting what God has for you in each and
[50:59] every service the prophet of God will
[51:01] put it this way he says remember today
[51:02] that every person leaving this door this
[51:05] back door out here either leaves with
[51:07] the mark of God or the mark of the end
[51:09] the apostate Church you say Oh Brother
[51:12] Brad him I go he says that doesn't have
[51:14] to do one thing to do with it the devil
[51:17] goes to church he's very religious the
[51:19] Bible said so in fact it says in the
[51:21] scripture that at the end he sits in the
[51:23] temple of God being worshiped as God by
[51:26] people that think they're worshiping God
[51:28] in the first place so Satan is not only
[51:30] trying to take the place of God but he's
[51:32] in a religious place and he is a
[51:34] religious spirit that's trying to infect
[51:36] the Believers that's what he is is he's
[51:38] a religious spirit we're talking about
[51:40] seduction and a seducing Spirit as far
[51:42] as we're concerned is a religious spirit
[51:44] that is the greatest deception we'll
[51:46] face it's not something physical it's
[51:48] not something mental but it's something
[51:50] religious that's trying to get us away
[51:52] from what it means to truly be a son or
[51:54] a daughter of God and listen one of the
[51:56] simplest seductions that Satan has is he
[51:58] says because you've showed up to church
[52:00] today you're good
[52:02] as if somehow showing up here is the
[52:05] check mark that proves that you are a
[52:06] son or a daughter of God and that's all
[52:08] you really need to do this week but
[52:10] listen going to church sitting under the
[52:12] preaching of the word wherever that
[52:13] might be is our reasonable service
[52:16] that's just Basics that's just Basics
[52:19] that's no different than reading your
[52:21] Bible and praying and these different
[52:22] things that is expected of a child of
[52:24] God so the fact that you do it does not
[52:27] make you a child of God but a child of
[52:28] God will do it it's just the nature of a
[52:31] Believers to sit under the hearing of
[52:32] the word because it does something for
[52:34] them that they can't get from anything
[52:35] else there's something special that
[52:37] happens when the word of God is going
[52:39] forth
[52:41] he says listen here men and women now my
[52:44] friends and Christian friends if the
[52:46] only thing that you know about is just
[52:48] simply coming to church you stop that
[52:50] right now
[52:51] stop just thinking you're all right if
[52:54] you've got an imaginary mind and say
[52:55] well I believe I'm saved and you see
[52:58] that you're always picking fusses or
[53:00] you're always griping about something
[53:01] there's something wrong with you if you
[53:04] see you just can't keep enmity out of
[53:06] your heart he says if you see there is
[53:09] something like that
[53:10] he says there's a seducing Spirit
[53:12] there's an enticing Spirit there's a
[53:14] problem if all you're saying is I'm
[53:16] going to church and I'm okay and then he
[53:17] says you're just causing trouble every
[53:19] time else you come to church and you're
[53:21] a Christian and you walk out the door
[53:22] and you're no longer a Christian
[53:24] what happens
[53:26] something isn't happening in church
[53:28] that's happening in your life it's
[53:29] supposed to be consistent in these
[53:30] things
[53:32] I was talking to a brother about this
[53:34] topic this week and he said I guess
[53:35] you're going to spiritual seduction next
[53:37] and I said yes that's exactly where
[53:39] we're going because that's all that's
[53:40] left and I want to repeat to you
[53:41] spiritual seduction means that a
[53:43] religious spirit will try and get on a
[53:45] child of God
[53:46] and if he can do that it makes you think
[53:48] that you're doing what you're supposed
[53:49] to be doing it makes you think that
[53:51] you're more than you are it makes you
[53:52] think you're right with God and you're
[53:54] actually walking away from God on a
[53:55] daily basis whether it's one step a day
[53:57] or five steps a day or whether you're
[53:59] running it doesn't matter a religious
[54:00] spirit it twists your mind to make you
[54:02] think that you're okay with God
[54:04] listen I read that quote because brother
[54:07] Brown's warning us he's saying don't
[54:08] relax just because you're in church
[54:10] don't relax because you're in a good
[54:12] church don't relax because you're
[54:14] sitting under a good Ministry that stays
[54:15] with the word he's saying keep your
[54:17] guard up because that is not what's
[54:19] going to make you a believer
[54:21] a Believer will do it but that's not
[54:22] what it's all about you've got to be on
[54:24] your guard
[54:25] because Satan will now come in here and
[54:27] you sit under the hearing of the word
[54:28] and what he's trying to do is he's
[54:30] trying to intercept it between it hit
[54:32] the time it hits your ear and it goes
[54:33] through your mind and gets to your heart
[54:35] if he can stop it here and put a Twist
[54:37] or add a word or take it away or just
[54:39] make it not quite the way it's supposed
[54:41] to be then by the time it comes down to
[54:43] your heart it loses its power because
[54:45] it's not original it's not pure it's not
[54:48] complete you need the full word of God
[54:50] to have the full Victory we're looking
[54:52] for a full restoration of the word in
[54:54] this hour and that's what came to us
[54:56] because we needed a full restoration to
[54:58] have the full effect because through
[55:00] 2000 years since Christ died what
[55:02] happened was he built up the church
[55:04] under the the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[55:06] on the day of Pentecost and then they
[55:08] fell from their first love and they went
[55:09] down down down and the power went out of
[55:12] the church not just to live it but to
[55:14] prove it
[55:15] they lost everything and there were only
[55:17] a few Witnesses in the Dark Ages and
[55:19] these different things but now through
[55:20] Luther and Wesley and coming back into
[55:22] Pentecost and now the bride age what
[55:24] he's doing is he's restoring the
[55:26] fullness of the word so that he can have
[55:28] the fullness of the word where in our
[55:30] lives if Satan can stop it right here
[55:34] and never let it get here so that it
[55:36] comes out of your life you're under a
[55:38] religious spirit and he's got you fooled
[55:40] because you're saying amen but amen amen
[55:42] means so be it that means it's got to
[55:44] come out of you not just into you
[55:47] amen is not saying I agree with that a
[55:50] man is saying I agree with it enough to
[55:51] let it have an effect in my life that's
[55:53] what we're looking for these days amen
[55:56] the word we read before in in previous
[55:58] Services is an All or Nothing
[55:59] proposition you're either in or you're
[56:01] out if you're half in you're out
[56:04] if you're three quarters in you're still
[56:07] out you've got to be all in or all out
[56:09] like we said there's no drunk sober man
[56:11] you're either drunk or you're sober and
[56:13] there is no middle ground
[56:15] there is no middle ground in these
[56:17] things
[56:18] listen we had to have this Bible opened
[56:21] up to us because Christ said I am the
[56:23] way the truth and the life and what do
[56:24] they do on the day of Pentecost they
[56:26] showed them the way
[56:27] and when they accept they saw the way
[56:29] they accepted the truth and that truth
[56:31] LED them into life and that's what we've
[56:33] got to do is we've we have a message
[56:34] we've been given an end time message and
[56:36] we look at it and we say that's the way
[56:38] and then we say that's truth and I
[56:40] believe it but will it become life
[56:41] because if it doesn't become life we're
[56:43] under a religious spirit
[56:46] no I'm not saying that if you don't have
[56:48] life today that you're not a child of
[56:49] God I'm just saying there's more for you
[56:51] and there's more for me
[56:53] that's where we're at amen is we've got
[56:55] to look at our lives and say are we
[56:56] being restored back to what it really
[56:58] means to be a full child of God a son or
[57:00] a daughter of God listen it's all Christ
[57:04] he said I'm the way the truth and the
[57:05] life it's all Christ whether whether
[57:07] he's revealing himself to you as an
[57:08] unbeliever as a new believer or as a
[57:11] fully seasoned believer it's all Christ
[57:12] and he's restoring us back to reflect
[57:14] him to reflect the word that he's given
[57:16] us in this agent in this time
[57:18] but I want us to see how Satan seduces
[57:21] us spiritually because I want to bring
[57:23] it right home you know me even if we're
[57:26] preaching on Mysteries we want to bring
[57:28] it back to where it affects us we don't
[57:30] just want to have an intellect of it an
[57:32] intellectual conception of it but we
[57:33] want a reality in our lives every single
[57:35] day so I want to talk about our personal
[57:37] walk today and and just maybe shine up
[57:41] the armor and sharpen up the sword a
[57:43] little bit this evening to just see
[57:44] where we're at because I don't want this
[57:46] to be a service where we look around at
[57:48] everyone else
[57:49] amen I want to look at myself and
[57:51] believe me in studying this and reading
[57:53] through it in that you do a lot of
[57:54] introspection because that's what the
[57:56] word is supposed to do you understand
[57:58] even in communion the idea is that you
[58:01] judge yourself so that nobody else has
[58:02] to jump you judge you so that God
[58:04] himself doesn't have to judge you
[58:05] because you're taking the word and
[58:07] you're running your life through it as a
[58:08] filter and then you say that needs to be
[58:10] adjusted that needs to be changed and
[58:12] that's what the preaching of the word is
[58:13] doing is showing us where we need change
[58:15] sometimes it's affirming and that's good
[58:17] but we're mostly here to be corrected to
[58:19] be told what's right so that we can come
[58:21] to God for those changes
[58:26] so Paul starts with Timothy and he says
[58:28] preach the word be instant in season out
[58:31] of season
[58:32] what does that look like brother John it
[58:35] says reprove rebuke exhort with all
[58:38] long-suffering and Doctrine and Paul's
[58:40] talking to Timothy says Timothy you've
[58:42] got to be focused you got to know what
[58:44] it means to be a minister and this is
[58:46] what it means to be a minister Timothy
[58:48] this is what I need you to do until you
[58:50] can't do it anymore and he's saying
[58:52] preach it and preach it straight preach
[58:54] it all don't leave anything out he says
[58:56] and go until they've got it that word
[58:58] reprove means to convict
[59:00] to tell of one's fault to bring to light
[59:03] and to expose
[59:06] how many of us want that
[59:09] no we don't want that do we
[59:12] but if you want to be right with God
[59:13] you've got to go for it
[59:15] you've got to be willing to sit under
[59:16] preaching that will do that
[59:18] rebuke we think of that as what we do to
[59:21] our children we they do something or
[59:23] they're not acting right and we rebuke
[59:24] them we're we're sharp with them and the
[59:26] word means to censure or admonish
[59:28] sharply or to correct
[59:30] he says Timothy you've got to convict
[59:33] them and then you've got to admonish
[59:35] sharply you've got to correct them
[59:37] then he says exhort so this now switches
[59:39] it and that means to beseech to entreat
[59:42] to plead to beg
[59:45] so the preacher can't be beating you all
[59:47] the time
[59:48] he's got to be begging he's got to be
[59:50] pleading he's got to be standing in the
[59:52] Gap he's got to be pulling you to the
[59:54] word as well
[59:55] sometimes he's got to use a carrot and
[59:57] sometimes he's got to use a stick
[1:00:00] but it can't be all stick and it can't
[1:00:01] be all carrot because it's got to be
[1:00:03] reproved and rebuke and exhort all of
[1:00:06] it's got to go together
[1:00:08] how long Timothy how long do you do this
[1:00:10] he says with all long-suffering that
[1:00:13] that means with patience with endurance
[1:00:15] with constancy with steadfastness with
[1:00:18] perseverance do it and do it and do it
[1:00:22] and do it he gives him no else for if
[1:00:25] you're tired if you're worn out if
[1:00:26] you're weary if you're offended if
[1:00:28] you're sick he says do it and do it and
[1:00:31] do it and do it because that's what a
[1:00:32] preacher does is he preaches the word
[1:00:35] keep going Timothy keep going
[1:00:37] how or with what what do you preach
[1:00:40] about he says with all long-suffering
[1:00:42] and all Doctrine in other words teach it
[1:00:45] all Timothy don't leave it out preach
[1:00:48] the Mysteries preach Faith preach
[1:00:50] Deliverance preach healing preach
[1:00:53] correction preach all of these things
[1:00:55] don't leave it out give them the full
[1:00:57] package and lay it in their laps so they
[1:00:59] know what they're supposed to do
[1:01:00] he says don't ever slack because it's
[1:01:02] unpopular
[1:01:04] stay with it
[1:01:06] I pulled this up in the Amplified Bible
[1:01:08] and this is great because the standard
[1:01:10] scripture is often not so easy to
[1:01:12] understand but in the Amplified it says
[1:01:14] preach the word
[1:01:16] keep your sense of urgency stand by be
[1:01:19] at hand and ready whether the
[1:01:21] opportunity seems to be favorable or
[1:01:23] unfavorable
[1:01:25] in other words whether it is convenient
[1:01:27] or inconvenient whether it is welcome or
[1:01:31] unwelcome you as a preacher of the word
[1:01:33] are to show people in what way their
[1:01:36] lives are
[1:01:38] wrong
[1:01:40] correction shows you what's right and
[1:01:42] now it's up to them to compare that to
[1:01:44] where they are I'm not here to tell you
[1:01:46] where your life's wrong I'm here to tell
[1:01:47] you what's right and then you can judge
[1:01:48] yourself where your life is whether it's
[1:01:50] right or wrong
[1:01:51] he says and convince them rebuking and
[1:01:54] correcting warning and urging and
[1:01:56] encouraging them being on flagging and
[1:01:59] inexhaustible impatience and teaching
[1:02:04] that's a preacher
[1:02:06] that's a man I want to hear somebody
[1:02:08] that'll give me the straight goods and
[1:02:09] give me the whole package and leave
[1:02:11] nothing out
[1:02:12] whether he knows I'm going to like it or
[1:02:14] not
[1:02:15] that's how you know he's a real preacher
[1:02:17] is he'll tell you whether you'd like it
[1:02:19] or not
[1:02:20] but it's got to be the truth
[1:02:21] it's got to be in the right context and
[1:02:24] it's got to be with the right attitude
[1:02:26] the right motive and objective
[1:02:29] that's what it's about and Timothy was
[1:02:31] was a favorite of Paul's and Paul Paul
[1:02:34] had ordained Timothy and he was a
[1:02:36] special one to him but he's saying
[1:02:37] Timothy you got to do it all or you're
[1:02:39] not going to be effective
[1:02:40] and you can't die out you can't you
[1:02:43] can't quit you can't slow down for any
[1:02:45] reason he says you've got to go go go
[1:02:49] but I want to jump back because that's
[1:02:51] second Timothy 4 if we look at second
[1:02:53] Timothy 3 he tells him why you've got to
[1:02:56] do the whole package
[1:02:57] and he says here in verse 16 of second
[1:02:59] Timothy 3 he says all scripture is given
[1:03:02] by inspiration of God that is our
[1:03:04] absolute and that's why it's our
[1:03:06] absolute set we believe that everything
[1:03:07] in here is correct
[1:03:10] it's that simple
[1:03:12] and that is our absolute and so whether
[1:03:14] you're from the coffee family the
[1:03:16] curlette family from the the Collins
[1:03:18] family or the Walsh legger family it
[1:03:20] doesn't matter when we come together
[1:03:21] this is our absolute not what I think
[1:03:24] and not what you think this is what we
[1:03:26] go back to and where there's conflict we
[1:03:28] go back to this
[1:03:30] not to whose friend is is whose friend
[1:03:32] or who's got influence or who's in an
[1:03:34] office this is where we go back to
[1:03:36] resolve conflict if there's a difference
[1:03:38] of opinion this is the absolute
[1:03:41] so he says Timothy all of scripture is
[1:03:43] given by inspiration of God he says and
[1:03:45] it's profitable
[1:03:47] that means it's good for growth it's for
[1:03:49] our benefit it's good for us
[1:03:51] what is it profitable for what's it good
[1:03:53] for for Doctrine now we love Doctrine
[1:03:56] because of times it's attached to
[1:03:57] teaching it's attached to the Mysteries
[1:04:00] it's attached to all these things and
[1:04:01] it's easy for us to absorb
[1:04:03] intellectually
[1:04:04] Doctrine is simple for most Believers to
[1:04:07] accept
[1:04:08] but then he says it's also profitable
[1:04:11] for reproof
[1:04:13] now that's not so fun anymore because
[1:04:15] doctrine's a whole lot easier to take
[1:04:17] but he says it's it's anointed its
[1:04:20] purposes for reproof as well and for
[1:04:22] correction
[1:04:24] you know what happens when people don't
[1:04:26] want correction they keep saying preach
[1:04:28] the doctrine
[1:04:30] but don't look at my life
[1:04:32] but it's good for correction too
[1:04:33] brothers and sisters
[1:04:36] he says them for instruction and
[1:04:38] righteousness now that sounds wonderful
[1:04:39] instruction and righteousness I'd love
[1:04:42] to have a class on instruction in
[1:04:43] righteousness 101 but you know what that
[1:04:45] word means it means if you look at it in
[1:04:48] the original word it means nurture
[1:04:51] instruction and chastisement it is the
[1:04:55] whole training of children
[1:04:58] so it will this word is given it's
[1:05:01] inspired and it's profitable to take you
[1:05:03] from a nobody in Christ to a fully
[1:05:06] mature adult in Christ it's good for the
[1:05:08] whole thing so whether you're a babe in
[1:05:10] Christ whether you just come to him
[1:05:12] whether you've been with him for 20
[1:05:13] years or whether you've been on with
[1:05:14] them for your entire life and you're
[1:05:16] ready to cross over to the other side
[1:05:17] this word is good for you from start to
[1:05:19] finish and it'll keep you growing and
[1:05:21] moving forward
[1:05:24] he says why that the man of God may be
[1:05:27] perfect
[1:05:28] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:05:31] good works listen if you'll take the
[1:05:33] doctrine if you'll take the proof if
[1:05:35] you'll take the correction if you'll
[1:05:37] take the instruction in righteousness
[1:05:38] then you'll be perfect meaning mature
[1:05:41] and you'll be furnished you'll be built
[1:05:43] up you'll be you'll be blessed with
[1:05:45] you'll be given the things that make you
[1:05:47] able to do what God wants you to do it
[1:05:49] says you'll be thoroughly furnished unto
[1:05:51] all good works
[1:05:54] good works are not things that we think
[1:05:56] are good because there's only one good
[1:05:58] and that's God good works meaning you're
[1:06:00] doing his will
[1:06:02] not what you think is good but what he
[1:06:04] wants you to do that is good
[1:06:07] and that doesn't always look good to the
[1:06:09] world
[1:06:11] but it's in his eyes that we it's him we
[1:06:13] answer to not to the world we don't
[1:06:15] answer to social media we don't answer
[1:06:17] the world opinion we don't answer to
[1:06:19] politics we answer to the word of God
[1:06:21] Amen
[1:06:22] I read that quote in this first series
[1:06:25] on this service where brother Bram said
[1:06:26] that if we come to church for anything
[1:06:28] less than the growing God we've misled
[1:06:30] ourselves and we fooled ourselves into
[1:06:32] why we're here
[1:06:34] listen I want to say if something
[1:06:35] touches you today and it's an area of
[1:06:38] your life that's sensitive or it's
[1:06:40] private or you don't think that I ought
[1:06:42] to be saying anything about it let me
[1:06:44] just say that's what we're here for
[1:06:47] and anything I say today if it touches
[1:06:49] you that way I'm not picking on anybody
[1:06:51] I've got enough to deal with on myself
[1:06:53] to try and go pick on somebody but I do
[1:06:55] have to preach the full word
[1:06:57] and that means it's going to be
[1:06:58] uncomfortable for me at times it's going
[1:07:00] to be uncomfortable for you at times but
[1:07:02] I've still got to preach the full word
[1:07:03] like he told Timothy do amen
[1:07:06] so I want to read that quote again he
[1:07:08] says that's what we come to church for
[1:07:09] is to find out where our faults are and
[1:07:12] the things that we might better
[1:07:13] ourselves by if we come to church for
[1:07:16] any other objective than this I'm afraid
[1:07:18] we won't get too much out of coming to
[1:07:20] church we must come to find out our
[1:07:22] weaknesses find our bad places and see
[1:07:25] how little we are
[1:07:27] and then I said he says and put our
[1:07:30] trust in somebody that's strong that's
[1:07:32] what takes the sting out of it
[1:07:34] amen I've said it many times don't run
[1:07:37] from conviction conviction is of god
[1:07:40] conviction tells you what is right it
[1:07:43] shows you where you're wrong and then it
[1:07:45] shows you how to get from wrong to right
[1:07:47] God always gives you a way of Escape he
[1:07:50] always shows you the path he always
[1:07:52] opens the door for you to go from wrong
[1:07:54] to right Satan on the other hand will
[1:07:57] give you condemnation condemnation tells
[1:07:59] you where you're wrong how it's your
[1:08:01] fault how you can't do anything about it
[1:08:03] and it leads you to a place where you
[1:08:04] quit
[1:08:05] that's what condemnation does is because
[1:08:07] it doesn't give you a way out it doesn't
[1:08:09] show you the grace of God it doesn't
[1:08:11] show you the mercy of God it doesn't
[1:08:12] show you that there's power to change
[1:08:14] you from wrong to right but conviction
[1:08:17] will do that and it's there to tell us
[1:08:19] that we need to go someplace else
[1:08:21] that's what it's there for amen listen
[1:08:24] Satan wants us to quit conviction is
[1:08:26] there to tell you I care about you
[1:08:28] enough to let you know that there's a
[1:08:30] higher plane than where you're at today
[1:08:32] but at the end of this when Paul is
[1:08:34] telling Timothy to preach the full word
[1:08:36] he says here's why Timothy he says for
[1:08:39] the time will come when they will not
[1:08:41] endure sound Doctrine but after their
[1:08:44] own lusts they shall Heap to themselves
[1:08:47] teachers having itching ears and they
[1:08:49] shall turn their ears turn away their
[1:08:51] ears from the truth and shall be turned
[1:08:53] into fables so we have two things
[1:08:55] happening here and it's forming the
[1:08:57] perfect seduction because the perfect
[1:08:59] seduction is when somebody wants what
[1:09:01] the other person's offering
[1:09:04] it's the perfect sales job is when your
[1:09:07] product sells itself listen when it's 25
[1:09:09] or 30 degrees in the middle of August
[1:09:12] you don't have to work to sell ice cream
[1:09:15] you say I've got ice cream and people
[1:09:17] will hand you money they'll throw their
[1:09:18] money at you to get your ice cream why
[1:09:21] because you're offering what they
[1:09:22] already want you don't have to convince
[1:09:24] them that ice cream will cool you off
[1:09:26] that it'll feel good that it'll taste
[1:09:27] good they're going to buy it
[1:09:29] now more likely in Newfoundland what
[1:09:31] you're looking for is a hot latte
[1:09:33] because it's cold and it's windy and
[1:09:35] it's raining it's wet and guess what in
[1:09:37] the middle of the winter Starbucks does
[1:09:39] a booming business because everyone
[1:09:41] wants their hot drink
[1:09:43] they don't have to work to sell in
[1:09:45] Starbucks in the winter because
[1:09:46] everybody wants to be warm and so the
[1:09:49] perfect seduction here is that people
[1:09:51] want ministers they want teachers they
[1:09:53] want speakers to say what they want to
[1:09:56] hear and those men are perfectly willing
[1:09:59] to do it
[1:10:00] so it's a perfect seduction the problem
[1:10:01] is one of them doesn't know that what
[1:10:03] they want is going to hurt them and the
[1:10:05] other one's already damned in the first
[1:10:06] place
[1:10:08] so they want what the other person has
[1:10:10] but they don't realize the damage it's
[1:10:12] going to cost it's going to cause them
[1:10:13] amen
[1:10:14] so it says that what's going to happen
[1:10:16] to these people and these are not people
[1:10:17] out in the world these are professing
[1:10:19] Christians
[1:10:20] this is the word it's for believers it's
[1:10:22] for professing Christians it's not
[1:10:24] talking about the world it's saying that
[1:10:25] people that want to be Christians are
[1:10:28] going to go there and they won't take
[1:10:30] the full of the fullness of the word of
[1:10:32] God
[1:10:33] they'll only go so far into it and then
[1:10:35] they'll say that's far enough and
[1:10:37] they'll take enough to make them feel
[1:10:38] that they're a Christian and satisfy
[1:10:40] their religious inclination or
[1:10:41] obligation that's all it is is it's just
[1:10:44] scratching an itch but it's not solving
[1:10:46] the actual problem they won't take
[1:10:48] enough to change them they won't get
[1:10:50] uncomfortable
[1:10:52] that's the problem with it and that's
[1:10:54] how you recognize it is if you'll stop
[1:10:56] short of the word of God because you're
[1:10:57] uncomfortable then a religious spirit
[1:11:00] has seduced you and made you stop
[1:11:03] this is a highly uncomfortable Christian
[1:11:05] walk listen Jesus said they're going to
[1:11:07] throw you out of their their synagogues
[1:11:09] you're going to be beaten you're going
[1:11:10] to be bruised you're going to be kicked
[1:11:11] out of here you're going to be rejected
[1:11:13] and in the end they're going to kill you
[1:11:15] that was the promise to the to the
[1:11:17] apostles
[1:11:19] and do we think it's going to be any
[1:11:20] different the scripture says if we're
[1:11:22] going to reign with him we've got to
[1:11:23] suffer with him and we're going to face
[1:11:25] persecution and we're going to lose
[1:11:27] opportunities and our jobs will be
[1:11:28] affected in our relationships and even
[1:11:30] things within families will be effective
[1:11:32] because we've taken a stand for the word
[1:11:34] of God because it's something that's
[1:11:35] inside of us
[1:11:37] what's the driving force for these
[1:11:39] people their own lust their own desires
[1:11:42] their own preferences their own mindsets
[1:11:43] they're seeking an affirming voice
[1:11:45] rather than a correcting voice
[1:11:48] that's always the problem is if you're
[1:11:50] going to listen to people that agree
[1:11:51] with you you're never going to change
[1:11:53] and you're never going to really find
[1:11:54] the truth either
[1:11:56] listen if they can get a minister to say
[1:11:58] you're all right brother
[1:11:59] you're all right sister you're just fine
[1:12:02] where you are here's the hook God
[1:12:04] understands
[1:12:07] that's one of the greatest seductions
[1:12:09] you're ever going to hear church God
[1:12:11] understands where you're at God
[1:12:12] understands but he won't leave you in
[1:12:15] that condition
[1:12:16] listen he he's a he's a high priest he's
[1:12:19] an intercessor that can be touched by
[1:12:21] the feeling of our infirmities he knows
[1:12:23] what it's like to be faced with
[1:12:24] temptation
[1:12:26] but he doesn't leave us in that place he
[1:12:29] doesn't give us an excuse for our
[1:12:30] weakness he says I can help you with
[1:12:32] that I can make a change in your life so
[1:12:35] God understands your heart he
[1:12:36] understands where you're at but he won't
[1:12:38] leave you there he's always drawing you
[1:12:40] to what he says in his word is the
[1:12:42] correct place to be
[1:12:44] listen to this he says are you born
[1:12:47] again
[1:12:48] are you born again tonight he says does
[1:12:51] your life cope with his word now that
[1:12:53] cope we don't mean like a coping
[1:12:55] mechanism something that that allows you
[1:12:57] to endure something or deal with
[1:12:58] something that word cope is if you look
[1:13:00] oh we don't have any Trim in here but if
[1:13:02] you're ever doing trim work you cope it
[1:13:04] you've got to cut it at a certain angle
[1:13:05] so that the two pieces will fit together
[1:13:07] perfectly he says does your life fit
[1:13:09] perfectly into the word does it dovetail
[1:13:11] with the word
[1:13:12] he said Do Your Action does your action
[1:13:16] does your life does your dressing does
[1:13:19] your behavior does your spirit does your
[1:13:23] faith all cope with the word of God he
[1:13:26] says then that shows the life in you is
[1:13:29] living Christ
[1:13:31] what is one of the greatest seductions
[1:13:33] you'll hear is God sees your heart and
[1:13:36] it's said in a way that makes you think
[1:13:38] that whatever you do is okay as long as
[1:13:40] what's in your heart is good
[1:13:44] we talked about Saul didn't we
[1:13:46] Saul had good intentions
[1:13:49] but he didn't obey the word of God fully
[1:13:51] and it cost him his kingdom amen
[1:13:54] listen
[1:13:55] the scripture says that God looks at the
[1:13:57] heart of a man he judges by our heart
[1:13:59] but he tells us he says buy your fruit
[1:14:01] you will know them
[1:14:04] because what's in will always come out
[1:14:05] I've read it in my devotions this
[1:14:07] morning where Jesus said what goes into
[1:14:08] US is not what defiles us but what comes
[1:14:11] out because he says out of the inside of
[1:14:12] you what's inside of you that's what
[1:14:14] causes you to do murderers and
[1:14:16] adulteries in line and all these
[1:14:17] different things he says there's
[1:14:18] something inside of you that's pushing
[1:14:20] you to do those things it's not the food
[1:14:22] you eat that's gonna going to cause you
[1:14:23] to fall away from God it's the thing
[1:14:25] that's in your heart already
[1:14:27] that's what's going to hurt you
[1:14:29] and James he says does a fountain send
[1:14:32] forth at the same place Sweet Water and
[1:14:34] bitter
[1:14:35] can your life produce Christ in
[1:14:37] something else simultaneously it can't
[1:14:39] it's got to be one or the other you're
[1:14:41] either in or you're out you're either
[1:14:42] Christian or you're not you're either a
[1:14:43] Believer or you're not
[1:14:45] so you can't say my heart is right and
[1:14:47] my actions are not something's wrong
[1:14:49] there Something's Happened to twist you
[1:14:51] into thinking that because you had a
[1:14:53] good intention then everything you do is
[1:14:55] going to be okay listen if God's in your
[1:14:57] heart God's going to come out of your
[1:14:58] life
[1:14:59] if disobedience is in your heart then
[1:15:01] Rebellion will come out of your life
[1:15:02] it's what we saw with Saul listen we
[1:15:04] think Rebellion means you're actively
[1:15:06] working against God
[1:15:08] listen Saul was 95 in compliance with
[1:15:12] the word of God
[1:15:14] I I picked that number
[1:15:16] listen he killed all of the the people
[1:15:18] except one
[1:15:20] and he killed all of the animals that he
[1:15:22] was ordered to except the good ones he
[1:15:25] just kept a few
[1:15:27] but he said but Samuel when he came to
[1:15:29] when the prophet came to him he said
[1:15:30] Saul you are in Rebellion because you
[1:15:33] didn't go all the way you did most of it
[1:15:35] but you didn't do all of it and that's
[1:15:37] where Rebellion lies in US is when we'll
[1:15:39] only go so far and say the rest doesn't
[1:15:41] matter and then God sees my heart that's
[1:15:43] what Saul said don't you understand why
[1:15:45] I did this don't you see my heart Samuel
[1:15:47] I did it so that we could sacrifice to
[1:15:49] God
[1:15:50] and Samuel said God doesn't want
[1:15:52] sacrifices God wants obedience
[1:15:54] God just wants obedience you're making
[1:15:57] this Grand gesture but he didn't ask for
[1:15:59] a grand gesture he just wants you to do
[1:16:01] what he asks you to do hey man
[1:16:04] listen in Saul's Rebellion he decided in
[1:16:07] his head that God didn't require full
[1:16:09] obedience to what God had said
[1:16:12] that's literally what he said that's
[1:16:14] literally what he thought and that's
[1:16:15] what he acted on is God didn't really
[1:16:16] mean it that way he's leaving it up to
[1:16:19] me he's giving me the option as to what
[1:16:20] I do here
[1:16:23] listen Jeremiah says the heart is
[1:16:25] deceitful Above All Things
[1:16:33] but John my heart's right
[1:16:36] your heart's not right this is right
[1:16:40] that's how you know your heart's right
[1:16:41] is what does the word say about what's
[1:16:42] in your heart
[1:16:44] but he says the heart is deceitful above
[1:16:46] all things and desperately wicked who
[1:16:49] can know it in other words who can
[1:16:51] really know it who can really say what
[1:16:53] it is or it isn't listen you can have
[1:16:55] good intentions and still be wrong I've
[1:16:57] done it
[1:16:58] I'm sure we all have I've done it where
[1:17:00] you do something with the even the right
[1:17:02] motive and objective but it was
[1:17:03] categorically wrong according to the
[1:17:06] word
[1:17:07] maybe not a hundred percent wrong but
[1:17:10] just five percent Wrong five percent
[1:17:11] wrong is still wrong
[1:17:14] but you keep saying if you keep saying
[1:17:16] well look at my heart look at my heart I
[1:17:17] didn't mean it I meant well
[1:17:20] I meant well as if that excuses us from
[1:17:23] doing something that's wrong no wrong is
[1:17:26] still wrong it is what it is
[1:17:28] listen I was reading in Leviticus last
[1:17:30] night I don't know if anybody's read
[1:17:32] Leviticus lately but it's a it's a tough
[1:17:34] read
[1:17:36] but you know why it's a tough read is
[1:17:38] because it's so repetitive
[1:17:40] and it's repetitive because it's going
[1:17:41] into the offerings for everything that
[1:17:43] you have to do if you do something wrong
[1:17:46] and it didn't matter how rich or how
[1:17:47] poor you are there was always an
[1:17:49] offering you could make there was
[1:17:50] already always an offering you could
[1:17:52] afford to make things right between you
[1:17:54] and God
[1:17:55] but I was reading in Leviticus 5 and
[1:17:57] it's talking about the trespass offering
[1:17:59] now the trespass offering is what you do
[1:18:01] when you do something ignorantly
[1:18:04] you did something and you didn't know it
[1:18:06] was wrong
[1:18:07] or you did it without knowing you did it
[1:18:09] in the first place because back then
[1:18:10] they had issues where if you touch
[1:18:11] certain animals or certain things you
[1:18:14] could be defiled and you had to make
[1:18:16] that right it was very complex
[1:18:18] very stressful I'm sure
[1:18:20] but literally the trespass offering is
[1:18:22] before when you realize that you had
[1:18:24] messed up
[1:18:25] no matter your good intentions or your
[1:18:28] ignorance or your your you weren't doing
[1:18:30] anything on purpose it said you still
[1:18:32] had to go make it right and it starts
[1:18:34] out and it says you you know you can do
[1:18:36] a a bull or you can do a lamb or a goat
[1:18:39] and all these things but it says at the
[1:18:40] lowest end it says if you can't afford
[1:18:42] any of that it said take some fine
[1:18:45] flower
[1:18:47] it says and you've got to take that and
[1:18:48] you've got to go burn it as an offering
[1:18:51] but it says you can't add oil to it and
[1:18:55] you can't add frankincense to it now if
[1:18:57] you look in the other offerings if you
[1:18:59] look at the the the the wave offering
[1:19:01] that the offering if you if you wanted
[1:19:03] to give something to God he would say
[1:19:05] add oil to it add frankincense to it
[1:19:07] what he was saying was something you've
[1:19:09] given to me I'm going to add myself to
[1:19:12] it and it will be a blessing and the oil
[1:19:14] always represents the Holy Ghost it
[1:19:16] represents deity and frankincense is a
[1:19:19] sweet smell
[1:19:20] but when it comes to a time where you
[1:19:22] made a mistake and you didn't know it he
[1:19:24] says when you come to make it right
[1:19:26] don't try and spiritualize it
[1:19:28] don't try and add God into it don't try
[1:19:31] and say well the Lord led me to do it
[1:19:32] and that's why I did it
[1:19:34] and I was fooled no he says leave me out
[1:19:37] of it
[1:19:38] don't try and make it look better than
[1:19:40] it is don't try and cover it up don't
[1:19:42] try and make it sound or smell okay he
[1:19:45] says just let it be what it is and burn
[1:19:48] it and get it over with it is what it is
[1:19:51] don't try and blend God into your
[1:19:53] mistake
[1:19:54] so often as Believers that's what we'll
[1:19:56] fall back into is we'll try and blend a
[1:19:58] certain element of spirituality into
[1:19:59] what we did why because we're trying to
[1:20:01] get ourselves off the hook
[1:20:03] wrong is wrong if it's wrong by the word
[1:20:06] we're wrong no matter what we can't add
[1:20:08] God into our mistake he's outside of it
[1:20:10] he's outside of it amen listen I
[1:20:12] remember in Edmonton I think I was told
[1:20:14] this story many times but for the sake
[1:20:16] of Good Intentions bad actions one of my
[1:20:18] children wrote the word love l-o-v-e on
[1:20:21] the side of my car
[1:20:22] with a rock
[1:20:26] good intentions
[1:20:28] wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
[1:20:35] sometimes
[1:20:36] we think we're loving
[1:20:40] and it ain't love
[1:20:42] it's just something we think
[1:20:44] it's just a feeling it's just an emotion
[1:20:46] it's not according to the word
[1:20:49] and then we sit back and say well my
[1:20:51] intention was right listen if it's wrong
[1:20:54] it can't be of God
[1:20:55] it can't be of God and it's that simple
[1:20:57] and we have to be able to do that we
[1:20:59] have to be able to just say I was wrong
[1:21:02] do you know what the sermon of my title
[1:21:04] of my first sermon was
[1:21:06] I am wrong
[1:21:07] that's the way I started my Ministry
[1:21:08] with I am wrong because remember brother
[1:21:10] Bradham said he said that the spirit of
[1:21:13] the laodicean age the final age is to
[1:21:15] repent
[1:21:16] because they have a religious spirit
[1:21:19] and that's what we're on guard against
[1:21:21] in all of this and that's what we're
[1:21:22] coming to in the service today amen
[1:21:25] but Paul said to Timothy he says lust
[1:21:27] desires preferences whatever you want to
[1:21:28] call it that's what get us in trouble
[1:21:30] because we can't pick and choose the
[1:21:32] word
[1:21:33] so you know what we do is we'll leave
[1:21:35] where the full word is preached
[1:21:38] and we'll go find a preacher that will
[1:21:39] only preach what we want to hear
[1:21:41] because we can't say I don't want to
[1:21:43] hear that
[1:21:45] so what we do is we go find somebody
[1:21:47] that won't preach it so that we don't
[1:21:49] have to just flat out say I don't want
[1:21:50] to hear that kind of preaching that's
[1:21:52] what we do that's how you pick a teacher
[1:21:55] that's how you show you have an itching
[1:21:56] ear is that you will refuse to hear
[1:21:58] somebody that preaches the full thing
[1:21:59] and go and pick somebody that preaches
[1:22:01] what you like
[1:22:03] but that's not the full word it's got to
[1:22:05] be the whole thing it's got to be the
[1:22:07] whole thing amen listen like I said we
[1:22:09] know better than to say yeah I don't
[1:22:10] like the fact that he's preaching from
[1:22:12] the whole scriptures
[1:22:13] so we just go find a minister that
[1:22:15] focuses on the things that we like and
[1:22:16] believe me there's plenty of it out
[1:22:18] there amen some people just want to hear
[1:22:19] about the promises of God
[1:22:21] some people just want to hear the
[1:22:22] Mysteries some people just want
[1:22:24] practical preaching
[1:22:27] some people just want Doctrine some
[1:22:29] people just want a minister that shouts
[1:22:31] the whole time some people want
[1:22:32] Evangelical Services all the time some
[1:22:35] people just want Lonnie Jenkins up here
[1:22:36] all the time
[1:22:38] not a single one of those is wrong in
[1:22:41] and of itself but if that's all you're
[1:22:42] getting out of it then you're going to
[1:22:44] be stunted in your growth because you're
[1:22:45] not taking the full word of it amen and
[1:22:48] you can look back and say well I like
[1:22:49] this church I like this ministry or this
[1:22:51] is the way it used to be or no no no
[1:22:52] you've got to take the full package
[1:22:55] and that's why we have a five-fold
[1:22:56] Ministry not a one-fold ministry that's
[1:22:59] why we bring in other Ministries so that
[1:23:01] you'll get something that I can't give
[1:23:02] you
[1:23:03] and I've got to be okay with the idea
[1:23:05] that I can't give you anything
[1:23:07] and then a pastor is to feed you day to
[1:23:09] day week to week but there's an entire
[1:23:11] fivefold Ministry out there that's here
[1:23:13] to bring us everything that we need and
[1:23:15] God has anointed them to bring it to us
[1:23:17] not just me not just the pastor not just
[1:23:20] the the team that's here amen listen I
[1:23:22] love a good shouting service
[1:23:24] I love a service where it's all worship
[1:23:26] and and praise and the and the people
[1:23:28] are enthusiastic and they're feeling
[1:23:30] blessed and and they're worshiping and
[1:23:32] thanking God for good things
[1:23:34] listen I love having Joe Adams up here
[1:23:36] and he preaches faith and faith and
[1:23:38] faith and Faith until you think you
[1:23:39] could walk on water
[1:23:41] and we've seen the benefits of that
[1:23:44] but we can't have Joe Adams all the time
[1:23:47] then you put up ilani Jenkins now I know
[1:23:49] he can't come up anymore but you put on
[1:23:50] Alani Jenkins and you're enthralled with
[1:23:53] the depth and the greatness of the word
[1:23:55] of God and and the carefulness of how he
[1:23:57] put things together and that teaching it
[1:23:59] just solidifies you and you understand
[1:24:01] finally who you are and why you are the
[1:24:03] way you are in these different things
[1:24:06] but then you go sit down in a brother
[1:24:08] Ron Spencer meeting
[1:24:09] and he preaches on battles and he
[1:24:11] preaches on Victory and when you're out
[1:24:13] there you're looking around for that
[1:24:14] demon that's been bugging you for the
[1:24:15] last year and you just want to punch it
[1:24:17] until it can't talk
[1:24:19] and you're ready to go and you're all
[1:24:20] fired up and then maybe you go to camp
[1:24:22] and brother Danny steaman's there and he
[1:24:24] preaches a service that's so completely
[1:24:26] takes away your barriers that are
[1:24:29] holding you back and you find yourself
[1:24:30] at the altar weeping and repenting and
[1:24:33] getting cleaned out and scoured out and
[1:24:34] you don't care about it you don't care
[1:24:36] that you're bubbling snot out of your
[1:24:38] nose and your face is red and all these
[1:24:40] different things why because the word of
[1:24:41] God is being preached in its fullness
[1:24:43] across the entire Spectrum
[1:24:45] that's why we have all these different
[1:24:47] men that's why we don't focus on one
[1:24:49] style or one Ministry or one church and
[1:24:52] these things is because God's got a full
[1:24:53] group of men that are anointed to defeat
[1:24:56] us to bring us to that Perfection to
[1:24:58] bring us to a resurrection and a Rapture
[1:25:00] amen listen this word is full of so many
[1:25:02] good things
[1:25:04] so many good things why were we limit it
[1:25:06] to just the one thing or two things or
[1:25:07] or things that we like there's so much
[1:25:10] in there and it's all good for us it all
[1:25:12] has an effect listen I'm excited when I
[1:25:14] get to sit there
[1:25:15] I haven't sat down yet in this church
[1:25:17] yet
[1:25:19] I'm excited to have a minister come
[1:25:21] because I can sit there and he can
[1:25:23] preach at me
[1:25:25] because I've got to listen to myself
[1:25:26] preach most of the time
[1:25:28] but if I can sit there and he can he can
[1:25:30] touch my life and God can get personal
[1:25:32] with me and God can walk into that
[1:25:34] service and say all right son I see
[1:25:37] you've got some complexes building up I
[1:25:39] see you've got some pride working in see
[1:25:41] you've got some issues in your
[1:25:42] relationships I see you got some knots
[1:25:44] in your fishing line
[1:25:46] and if I can sit there and receive it
[1:25:48] he'll resolve those things that's what
[1:25:51] makes him personal that's what makes him
[1:25:53] a personal God is when he gets personal
[1:25:55] with me
[1:25:57] that's what I want I don't want a God
[1:25:59] that just stands around and talks to
[1:26:00] everyone else I want a God that works in
[1:26:03] my life I want a God that comes and sits
[1:26:05] next to me in my Pew and says I think
[1:26:08] you're important enough to send a man
[1:26:10] from three or four thousand kilometers
[1:26:12] away to talk to you about this today
[1:26:15] that's the kind of God that I believe in
[1:26:17] that's the kind of God that I serve is
[1:26:18] he's personal because he gets personal
[1:26:21] because he doesn't leave me unchecked
[1:26:23] because he doesn't leave me unchanged he
[1:26:25] doesn't leave me unchallenged but he
[1:26:27] comes in and he looks at me and he says
[1:26:29] that's not going to work
[1:26:31] you got to come up to a higher plane
[1:26:33] amen listen it's not all going to be
[1:26:35] shouting services
[1:26:38] listen we like our our pizza and we like
[1:26:40] our burgers and our Pops and our chips
[1:26:42] but sometimes I've got to sit there and
[1:26:44] I've got to eat spiritual cauliflower
[1:26:46] and broccoli and worst of all brussels
[1:26:48] sprouts
[1:26:50] but that's what's going to keep me
[1:26:52] growing that's what's going to keep me
[1:26:53] healthy is not the stuff I like it's the
[1:26:55] stuff I don't like that's usually going
[1:26:57] to do me the most good
[1:27:02] so often we're looking for what tastes
[1:27:04] good going down
[1:27:06] no it's what's got something packed into
[1:27:07] it that's going to do the body good when
[1:27:09] it's finally digested amen
[1:27:11] listen we can't be here to satisfy our
[1:27:13] taste buds
[1:27:14] we've got to say what does the body need
[1:27:17] not what does the mouth want
[1:27:20] because otherwise we're being led by
[1:27:21] lust rather than what is actually
[1:27:24] supposed to be in our body
[1:27:26] listen we have a pregnant lady in our
[1:27:28] midst
[1:27:30] I guarantee you she's eaten some weird
[1:27:31] things in the past eight months
[1:27:33] you know why because God has built into
[1:27:36] her
[1:27:37] the ability to Crave what her baby needs
[1:27:40] what her body needs I had a friend in
[1:27:43] high school that she wasn't pregnant in
[1:27:45] high school but when she she finally got
[1:27:47] married and had a child she liked
[1:27:49] pickles dipped in chocolate pudding
[1:27:53] now you say what in the world could she
[1:27:55] have needed maybe it was the salt
[1:27:57] content maybe who knows but that was
[1:28:00] needed for her and it was the only thing
[1:28:01] that would satisfy and while she was
[1:28:03] pregnant she liked it but as soon as she
[1:28:05] was done pregnancy she didn't want
[1:28:07] pickles and chocolate pudding but for
[1:28:09] the moment that was exactly what she
[1:28:10] needed and she would eat it and she
[1:28:12] would enjoy it and it would have the
[1:28:13] effect that she was looking for in our
[1:28:15] life
[1:28:16] church I say that to say this don't run
[1:28:19] from God
[1:28:20] don't run from the preaching of the word
[1:28:22] don't run from the personal portion of
[1:28:24] your service tonight
[1:28:27] run to it don't run away from it let's
[1:28:30] not have shame or pain or embarrassment
[1:28:32] listen only you really know
[1:28:35] only you really know I think sometimes
[1:28:36] people think that whoever's preaching
[1:28:38] knows something I think most of the time
[1:28:40] we don't have a clue we don't even
[1:28:41] realize what we're saying sometimes you
[1:28:43] know my wife will tell me after service
[1:28:46] who
[1:28:47] so-and-so is probably not feeling very
[1:28:49] good that was a that's like I don't even
[1:28:51] know don't even realize it most of the
[1:28:52] time don't even realize it so nothing's
[1:28:54] personal here from my side of things
[1:28:57] but look at this the prophet would say
[1:28:59] the Holy Spirit guarded the tree of life
[1:29:01] until the atonement was made and now the
[1:29:04] holy spirit is running people to the
[1:29:06] Tree of Life Adam and Eve was trying to
[1:29:08] get to the tree of life he says now
[1:29:10] their children are trying to stay away
[1:29:11] from the Tree of Life the Holy Spirit
[1:29:13] was guarding it but now it's bringing
[1:29:15] them to it he says and they refuse they
[1:29:18] refuse to hear the holy spirit's voice
[1:29:20] because the same adversary that caused
[1:29:22] them to sin in the beginning is keeping
[1:29:25] them away from the Tree of Life he says
[1:29:27] in Jesus Christ is the Tree of Life
[1:29:28] notice they refuse
[1:29:31] refusal is a choice
[1:29:34] it's a choice
[1:29:37] scripture says choose life
[1:29:39] that you may live
[1:29:41] behold I put before you now
[1:29:44] a choice
[1:29:46] living or dying choose life that you
[1:29:47] might live
[1:29:48] we sing that song many times amen and
[1:29:51] Satan has seduced them to hear a
[1:29:52] different voice
[1:29:54] and what is it he's wanting you to get
[1:29:55] to the place where it only affirms you
[1:29:58] but it never corrects or changes you
[1:30:01] if all you want to do is come in and
[1:30:03] have us Pat you on the back you're not
[1:30:05] going to grow
[1:30:06] you're not going to change and you're
[1:30:08] going to get left behind in your
[1:30:09] Christian walk amen I love it when the
[1:30:11] older folks will come up after a service
[1:30:13] and say that touched my life you know
[1:30:15] why because it tells me that they're
[1:30:16] still growing they're still Towing the
[1:30:18] line they're still battling they're
[1:30:20] still in it to grow
[1:30:22] because we grow until we're gone we grow
[1:30:24] until we're gone there's no point where
[1:30:26] we get to sit down and say that's it I'm
[1:30:28] done listen Paul only said that just
[1:30:31] before he died he says I have run my
[1:30:32] course I've finished my race he says and
[1:30:35] now I'm ready for the for the for the
[1:30:37] for what awaits me on the other side
[1:30:39] and until that point Paul was continuing
[1:30:41] to push Paul is continuing to press
[1:30:44] second Corinthians 3 says now the Lord
[1:30:46] is that spirit and where the spirit of
[1:30:49] the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:30:51] Church what does liberty mean to you
[1:30:53] tonight
[1:30:54] freedom to do anything
[1:30:56] freedom to be yourself
[1:30:58] that's what the world says today be
[1:30:59] yourself
[1:31:01] don't be yourself please
[1:31:03] otherwise you'll look like what the
[1:31:05] world looks like today and it ain't
[1:31:06] pretty don't be yourself that's what
[1:31:08] this Liberty is Paul says this Liberty
[1:31:10] this is what it does this is what it
[1:31:12] says it is but we all with open face
[1:31:15] beholding as in a glass the glory of God
[1:31:18] are changed into the same image from
[1:31:21] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[1:31:25] the Lord the Liberty he's talking about
[1:31:27] changes you into the image of Christ
[1:31:30] it sets you free this is a liberty that
[1:31:33] sets you free from influence it sets you
[1:31:35] free from your DNA it sets you free from
[1:31:37] your Traditions it sets you free from
[1:31:39] your pains from your hurts from your
[1:31:40] offenses it sets you free to grow it
[1:31:43] sets you free to change it sets you free
[1:31:45] to surrender to the word so that it can
[1:31:47] develop you into what you're meant to be
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] in Isaiah 28 scripture says Whom Shall
[1:31:54] he teach knowledge
[1:31:55] and whom shall we make to understand
[1:31:57] Doctrine them that are weaned from the
[1:31:59] milk and drawn from the breasts he said
[1:32:01] for precept must be upon precept precept
[1:32:04] upon precept line upon line line upon
[1:32:07] line hear a little in their world little
[1:32:09] so in other words it's a building
[1:32:11] process and once he's got one thing
[1:32:13] established once he's got you grounded
[1:32:15] in One Thing Once he's got it where it
[1:32:17] won't move then he adds the next bit to
[1:32:19] it and then when that's established he
[1:32:20] does the next bit and it's one thing on
[1:32:22] top of another we talk about the stature
[1:32:24] of a perfect man and we start at the
[1:32:26] bottom with faith and knowledge and
[1:32:27] virtue and these different things
[1:32:28] brother Mark really helping with that
[1:32:30] when he said it's not it's not building
[1:32:32] you up in a pyramid it's building you
[1:32:34] out like a tree so you're expanding in
[1:32:36] in diameter as you grow up and you're
[1:32:39] adding those things and as you add them
[1:32:41] they help you to grow taller and taller
[1:32:42] they help you to mature to the point
[1:32:44] where you can bear and support fruit
[1:32:47] that's what the word of God is doing is
[1:32:48] it's growing us out and it's growing us
[1:32:50] up at the same time
[1:32:53] what is getting you to the place where
[1:32:54] you're going to be able to be used of
[1:32:55] God to be able to produce the fruit of
[1:32:57] the Holy Spirit love joy peace patience
[1:32:59] kindness all these different things
[1:33:02] look at Philippians 3. this is Paul he's
[1:33:05] speaking to of himself and he says
[1:33:07] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:33:09] apprehended another this is the prophet
[1:33:12] of the age okay in other words he's
[1:33:14] saying I'm not there yet I don't have
[1:33:16] everything I'm supposed to have in my
[1:33:18] life I'm not everything I ought to be
[1:33:20] the prophet of the age is saying that so
[1:33:22] we ought to be able to say the same
[1:33:24] thing I'm not what I ought to be yet
[1:33:26] but I'm on the road there
[1:33:28] but I'm on a path I'm on a journey to go
[1:33:31] there
[1:33:32] but what does he do he says but this one
[1:33:34] thing I do
[1:33:35] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:33:38] and reaching forth under those things
[1:33:40] which are before
[1:33:42] getting those things which are behind
[1:33:44] burning all the bridges not watching
[1:33:47] your back Trail forsaking the things of
[1:33:49] the world
[1:33:51] even forgetting what happened in your
[1:33:54] Christian walk yesterday so that you
[1:33:56] don't hold on to it and keep yourself
[1:33:57] from going and for what he has today
[1:34:00] sometimes you've got to let go of that
[1:34:01] experience so you can have a new one
[1:34:04] because God wants to have a daily walk
[1:34:05] he wants to have a daily relationship
[1:34:07] not just a once a life once a week
[1:34:09] meeting and then he's looking to keep
[1:34:11] you moving and growing but Paul he says
[1:34:13] after all those things after I forget
[1:34:14] those things he says I press toward the
[1:34:17] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[1:34:19] of God in Christ Jesus the prophet of
[1:34:21] the age says I press
[1:34:23] once I've stopped forgetting I press
[1:34:26] Paul what are you doing today I press
[1:34:28] Paul you've got signs and wonders you've
[1:34:30] healed the dead you you you you've
[1:34:32] healed the sick you've raised the dead
[1:34:34] you've been almost killed multiple times
[1:34:37] you've been delivered out of this you've
[1:34:38] been delivered out of that Paul you're a
[1:34:40] great believer and yet I press
[1:34:42] I press and I press and I press why
[1:34:45] because there's something inside of me
[1:34:47] that says there's more
[1:34:49] there's something inside of me that says
[1:34:51] come up higher there's something that
[1:34:52] says you've got to keep going you can't
[1:34:54] stop you can't rest on your laurels
[1:34:56] you've got to keep moving forward and he
[1:34:58] says what am I going forward to the
[1:35:01] prize of the mark of the High Calling
[1:35:04] brother Branham would say he said he it
[1:35:07] is the highest ambition of a Christian
[1:35:08] is to do this and he says it's living
[1:35:11] for that great event the resurrection
[1:35:13] and the rapture
[1:35:15] Paul says until I have a resurrection
[1:35:17] until I'm a part of that Rapture
[1:35:19] nothing's going to stop me from pushing
[1:35:21] forward and a seducing Spirit the grand
[1:35:24] seduction will stop you from pressing
[1:35:26] it'll say you're good
[1:35:28] you're okay you don't have to try
[1:35:31] anymore you don't have to give up
[1:35:32] anymore you don't have surrender you
[1:35:33] don't have to Humble anymore you can
[1:35:35] stay where you're at you're at the peak
[1:35:37] of Christianity don't do anything else
[1:35:39] and it's a religious spirit
[1:35:42] you've got to keep pressing and pressing
[1:35:45] and pressing and pressing listen
[1:35:48] why your current condition is not
[1:35:52] raptured
[1:35:54] and the condition of the prize of the
[1:35:55] mark of the High Calling is raptured so
[1:35:58] until you're raptured or until you go on
[1:36:00] a resurrection keep pressing
[1:36:02] that's how we know we got to keep
[1:36:04] pressing we ain't raptured yet we
[1:36:06] haven't taken a body change we haven't
[1:36:07] gone to the other side amen
[1:36:10] that prize is to what to go in a Rapture
[1:36:12] of Resurrection
[1:36:14] seduction is always tied to satisfaction
[1:36:16] we speak of it physically where somebody
[1:36:19] wants intimacy from somebody else and
[1:36:20] they'll do whatever they want to get it
[1:36:22] but Paul said this perfect seduction is
[1:36:24] happening when the people have an inch
[1:36:26] and they want the ministry to scratch it
[1:36:28] so let me let me
[1:36:30] get you to realize this
[1:36:33] the grand seduction comes through the
[1:36:35] ministry
[1:36:36] that's the scary thing we're talking
[1:36:38] about here a religious spirit will come
[1:36:40] through the ministry
[1:36:42] and that's why you have to hold every
[1:36:43] Minister that comes up here accountable
[1:36:45] to this
[1:36:46] not to his gift
[1:36:48] he may see visions and dreams and he may
[1:36:50] he may heal the sick and do all the
[1:36:52] things that we have seen at different
[1:36:53] times perhaps but he is held accountable
[1:36:55] to this no matter what he's got to be
[1:36:57] held accountable to this
[1:36:59] listen you talk about slick and Sly
[1:37:01] basically the grand seduction of of
[1:37:03] Satan is to put the man up here
[1:37:05] under a spirit to tell you what you want
[1:37:07] to hear
[1:37:09] and if he can if he can pollute this up
[1:37:11] here then he'll pollute the rest of
[1:37:12] everybody that's listening to it
[1:37:14] that's why he targets the ministry so
[1:37:16] much because the influence that they
[1:37:18] have the impact they have is so much
[1:37:19] greater than most people will have on
[1:37:20] believers
[1:37:22] who do you trust more than a minister
[1:37:25] you'll tell things to a minister you
[1:37:27] won't tell to anybody else
[1:37:30] and Satan wants to get in there and
[1:37:31] break that trust and get that man to say
[1:37:33] something that he's not supposed to say
[1:37:35] or refuse to say something that he
[1:37:36] should say
[1:37:38] prophet of God says your church puts up
[1:37:40] with it your preacher is afraid to say
[1:37:42] anything afraid you won't pay your
[1:37:44] tithes anymore that's the reason that's
[1:37:45] the trouble he says my goodness how are
[1:37:47] you going to preach to a bunch of
[1:37:48] buzzards unless you get them converted
[1:37:50] and right with God to begin with they'll
[1:37:52] root their nose in dead stuff all the
[1:37:53] time what you need is a dumping out an
[1:37:56] old-fashioned Revival sweep from coast
[1:37:57] to coast and get men and women right
[1:37:59] with God let loose the things of the
[1:38:01] world let loose the petty soft soft
[1:38:04] pedaled preaching he says amen preach
[1:38:06] the gospel God said so if you love the
[1:38:09] world or the things of the world the
[1:38:11] love of God is not even in you
[1:38:13] that scripture is all you need to figure
[1:38:16] out where your heart is at it's so
[1:38:18] simple
[1:38:20] what do you love
[1:38:21] what do you love to do and where do you
[1:38:23] put your time
[1:38:24] and if it's something of the world then
[1:38:26] there's a problem
[1:38:28] he says people can jump up and down and
[1:38:30] shout all night long and speak in
[1:38:31] tongues like poor and peas on a dry
[1:38:33] cowhide and then walk right out the next
[1:38:35] morning with enough temper to fight a
[1:38:37] buzzsaw go right on out and tell
[1:38:39] something in the church that'll cause
[1:38:40] the whole church to be broke up
[1:38:43] it's nothing in the world but an
[1:38:45] enticing demon Spirits he says you want
[1:38:47] to come back to the word where God is
[1:38:49] Purity God is Holy amen he says that's
[1:38:52] right it's enticing Spirits versus the
[1:38:54] word of God
[1:38:55] what is it if a man won't preach the
[1:38:57] whole counsel of the word of God if he
[1:38:59] won't preach the full word of God if he
[1:39:00] won't give Doctrine and reproof and
[1:39:02] correction and nurturing and
[1:39:04] righteousness the people will always be
[1:39:06] stunted in their growth
[1:39:08] that's the effect because you need it
[1:39:10] all to be at all
[1:39:11] you need it all to be at all amen it
[1:39:13] keeps them from going into full maturity
[1:39:15] that's what Paul was saying to Timothy
[1:39:17] he says and they shall turn away their
[1:39:18] ears from the truth and shall be turned
[1:39:20] unto fables the other scripture says
[1:39:22] elsewhere that they'll believe a lie and
[1:39:24] be damned by it
[1:39:25] having their conscience here with a hot
[1:39:27] iron the people will turn away their
[1:39:29] ears from the church truth they refuse
[1:39:31] to hear it they may get offended they
[1:39:33] may get tired they may get weary and
[1:39:34] when they get weary they get sick of it
[1:39:36] and then they go find somebody that'll
[1:39:37] tell them what they want to hear or the
[1:39:39] way they want to hear it sometimes it's
[1:39:41] not the content it's the delivery
[1:39:44] scripture doesn't talk a whole lot about
[1:39:45] how you're supposed to preach it just
[1:39:47] tells you what you're supposed to preach
[1:39:48] if you look around at the ministry
[1:39:50] that's why we have so many very gifts so
[1:39:52] many different ways of delivering it is
[1:39:54] because God has a beautiful garden of
[1:39:55] ministers that are out there to meet the
[1:39:57] needs of all of us and there's things
[1:39:59] that I might not be able to say to you
[1:40:01] that another Minister can come in and
[1:40:02] you can hear it from him and that's
[1:40:04] God's grace to you through that man that
[1:40:06] man is a gift to you to do those things
[1:40:09] listen don't get me wrong we need a
[1:40:11] balanced diet I spoke of that a few
[1:40:13] Services ago where I said I'm pretty
[1:40:14] good if you just tell me what to do I'll
[1:40:15] do it
[1:40:16] I'm okay with orders
[1:40:19] but not everybody's okay with just
[1:40:20] orders we need a lot of encouragement
[1:40:22] and and we need soothing and all of
[1:40:24] these things amen that's why we have to
[1:40:26] bring in these outside Ministries and
[1:40:27] that's why I've got such a focus on
[1:40:28] bringing in fivefold ministries because
[1:40:30] I know I can't do it on my own I'm not
[1:40:33] anointed to do it on my own more to the
[1:40:35] point
[1:40:36] I'm here to feed you day to day but
[1:40:38] we've got men out there that are meant
[1:40:39] to come in and make a difference as well
[1:40:41] now just as we start to close here
[1:40:43] tonight I want to I'm just going to
[1:40:44] touch on a few things that that we can
[1:40:46] kind of look out for and it's a pretty
[1:40:48] wide net that I'll cast here and and
[1:40:50] it's just to show you the varied
[1:40:52] approach that Satan takes
[1:40:55] and again we're not focused on anybody
[1:40:57] here
[1:40:59] as in I'm not personally he says now
[1:41:01] another thing that has taken place I
[1:41:03] believe and think that any man that's
[1:41:05] got an experience with God or a woman is
[1:41:07] bound to get a little emotional
[1:41:11] I just believe it that's right he says
[1:41:13] but you know what they've adopted
[1:41:15] emotionalism for the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:18] Ghost they just get a lot of noise and
[1:41:20] there's nothing in it he said you live
[1:41:23] just as holy as you live noisy then
[1:41:25] you'll be all right
[1:41:28] emotions is certainly all right then he
[1:41:30] says Bali exercise profit of little but
[1:41:33] enticing Spirits has got over into the
[1:41:35] Holiness group of people and they've got
[1:41:37] them to just resting upon because they
[1:41:39] can shout or because they can dance or
[1:41:41] because they can make emotion
[1:41:43] then he talks about that the the false
[1:41:45] prophets that came before aab and he
[1:41:47] says that old fellow down there the
[1:41:48] chief of all of those prophets the
[1:41:50] preachers he was so sure he was right he
[1:41:52] made himself a pair of horns and danced
[1:41:54] all around and make a bigger commotion
[1:41:56] and he was going to push the other
[1:41:57] Assyrian army right out of the country
[1:41:59] but it was a lie it was God's word it
[1:42:03] said different amen see you can be
[1:42:05] emotional right he says but you got the
[1:42:08] right kind of emotion moving your
[1:42:10] emotion
[1:42:11] in other words God's got to be inspiring
[1:42:13] your emotion
[1:42:16] David danced before the Lord and his
[1:42:18] wife laughed at him and God looked down
[1:42:20] out of heaven and said David you're a
[1:42:22] man after my own heart
[1:42:23] why his motives were right his life was
[1:42:27] right behind it
[1:42:28] so just because we can be emotional
[1:42:30] don't mean we're saved because we go to
[1:42:33] church don't mean we're saved he says
[1:42:35] don't believe those enticing spirits
[1:42:38] a real spirit of God a real word of God
[1:42:41] is the truth of God which is a seed of
[1:42:43] God which will produce God in your life
[1:42:45] and you'll be Godly saintly and holy
[1:42:49] now listen don't look at your life and
[1:42:51] say I'm not all of those things yet
[1:42:53] therefore I'm wrong no a seed when it
[1:42:56] starts to grow go through a process
[1:42:59] so the idea is are you different today
[1:43:01] than you were yesterday are you
[1:43:03] different this week than you were last
[1:43:04] week are you different this month than
[1:43:06] last month are you different this year
[1:43:07] than last year what matters is are you
[1:43:10] changing in the right direction not are
[1:43:12] you perfect not are you fully mature yet
[1:43:14] but are you going in that right
[1:43:16] direction seed implies a process and so
[1:43:19] that means changes will be seen
[1:43:22] if a seed is growing there's an effect
[1:43:24] that's happening and it's changing how
[1:43:25] that looks now listen us Canadians so
[1:43:28] you Americans you don't have to listen
[1:43:30] you for the next few seconds we're not
[1:43:33] done to be a shouting group this service
[1:43:34] to the to a contrary uh
[1:43:37] testimony this morning
[1:43:39] or this evening
[1:43:41] but Canadians aren't known to be a
[1:43:42] shouting group so I think we're okay to
[1:43:44] say this okay so brother Brown was
[1:43:46] saying live live as holy as you live
[1:43:48] noisy
[1:43:50] as loud as you shout he says let your
[1:43:51] life be as holy as as Sanctified to God
[1:43:54] as your shouting is
[1:43:56] okay we don't generally have to we don't
[1:43:59] we're not a big focus on shouting we
[1:44:00] have it we don't have it it is what it
[1:44:02] is you know but I'll let me take it to
[1:44:04] where we we do live
[1:44:06] and that is let's talk
[1:44:09] like we live
[1:44:11] let our conversation be a true
[1:44:13] reflection of where we're at
[1:44:16] he said actions speak louder than words
[1:44:19] no matter what you're saying your life
[1:44:21] speaks so loud till they can't hear your
[1:44:24] testimony
[1:44:25] as I said this morning said just jump as
[1:44:28] high as you live
[1:44:30] see your actions speak louder than your
[1:44:32] words and you might as well just come
[1:44:34] out and say it because your own words
[1:44:35] speak your own life speaks your words no
[1:44:38] matter what it is your actions speak of
[1:44:40] what you are so I'm not here to say
[1:44:42] don't shout I believe we need more
[1:44:44] shouting listen you get the Holy Ghost
[1:44:46] you'll shout at some point listen you
[1:44:48] get the Deliverance you're looking for
[1:44:50] you'll shout some time you see the
[1:44:52] provision of God you see the healing of
[1:44:54] God you see the grace of God in your
[1:44:55] life in a moment it'll cause you to
[1:44:57] shout it's got to happen
[1:45:00] listen it will come along with it
[1:45:02] because with relationship always comes
[1:45:03] emotion but he's saying let's not
[1:45:05] pretend the relationship is so high that
[1:45:07] the emotion is
[1:45:08] is where it's at today
[1:45:10] let's live let's have our emotions
[1:45:12] reflect where we are in our relationship
[1:45:14] amen listen if you're if you're waiting
[1:45:17] for my preaching style to make you shout
[1:45:19] that's not going to do it
[1:45:21] if you're responding to my voice or the
[1:45:23] way I deliver it that's not what it's
[1:45:24] about but it's when you realize that God
[1:45:26] is here and he's talking to you
[1:45:28] personally that ought to make us shout
[1:45:29] that ought to make us say Amen that
[1:45:31] ought to make us say praise the Lord
[1:45:33] because that's what is Supernatural is
[1:45:34] not my delivery it's God coming in and
[1:45:37] touching your life
[1:45:38] that's what we shout about that's what
[1:45:40] we praise about in these things what is
[1:45:42] it because in that that's the power of
[1:45:43] God through the Holy Spirit quickening
[1:45:45] the word to come in and touch your life
[1:45:47] personally
[1:45:48] that's what makes a show because it's
[1:45:49] what the shout of the king and the camp
[1:45:51] we recognize his presence by what's
[1:45:53] happening
[1:45:54] in the worship in the preaching and all
[1:45:56] of these things
[1:45:57] that's the personal God that we're
[1:45:59] looking for
[1:46:00] but he takes us and he's talking about
[1:46:03] highly emotional worship and he's
[1:46:04] talking about churches full of it and
[1:46:06] that's why I say I don't feel like I'm
[1:46:08] pointing this at us but it's a caution
[1:46:10] for us
[1:46:11] because he'd say amongst a lot of people
[1:46:13] where we find emotions and so forth
[1:46:15] there become tattalings and backbitings
[1:46:18] and all kinds of ungodly things why
[1:46:20] because people that are susceptible to
[1:46:22] emotion in here are susceptible to
[1:46:24] emotion out there too
[1:46:25] and emotion will often lead us to say
[1:46:27] and do things that we ought not to do so
[1:46:29] he's saying if you're emotional without
[1:46:31] the anointing here you're going to be
[1:46:32] annoyed you're going to be emotional
[1:46:33] without the anointing out there and it's
[1:46:35] going to cause problems
[1:46:37] he says brother that's sulfuric acid in
[1:46:40] the church it's demon power he says it's
[1:46:42] the spirit of men and women who get
[1:46:44] among one another
[1:46:46] it's a natural human spirit it's not as
[1:46:48] Godly Spirit he says and try and push
[1:46:50] off and say this is not right and that's
[1:46:52] not right and that's not right he's
[1:46:53] talking about people that are going
[1:46:54] around calling out other people now
[1:46:57] same well brother so-and-so is not right
[1:46:59] and brother sisters or sister so-and-so
[1:47:01] is not right and look what she's wearing
[1:47:02] and look what he's doing or not doing in
[1:47:04] these different things
[1:47:05] he says if you'll Chase it down nine
[1:47:08] times out of ten times it's the very
[1:47:10] person making the stir that's not right
[1:47:14] he says amen God hates Discord among
[1:47:16] brethrens so I'm not telling you go look
[1:47:18] for who's causing problems I'm saying
[1:47:20] when you're causing problems stop and
[1:47:22] say am I doing it to get the light and
[1:47:24] the spotlight off of me
[1:47:27] because what he's saying is so often
[1:47:29] what happens is you've got an issue in
[1:47:31] your life and you don't want anyone to
[1:47:32] find out about it or focus on it so you
[1:47:34] go find somebody else's issue to put in
[1:47:36] the spotlight in hopes that you won't
[1:47:38] have to deal with yours and he says it's
[1:47:40] a what it's a religious spirit it's
[1:47:42] Satan it's sulfuric acid working on us
[1:47:44] that tries to get us to hide
[1:47:47] from the light
[1:47:50] so don't go around looking for the
[1:47:51] people causing problems go around and
[1:47:53] say am I causing problems am I acting up
[1:47:55] what causes me to do this why did I get
[1:47:57] so worked up today or why did I do that
[1:47:59] or why did I say that is there something
[1:48:01] that's inside of me that's off I can say
[1:48:04] that when I'm troubled internally when
[1:48:07] when something's off and I know I've got
[1:48:09] to deal with it I'm harder on the people
[1:48:10] around me
[1:48:11] why because I'm refusing to deal with
[1:48:14] what God's trying to fix inside of me
[1:48:16] and I turn harsh with other people
[1:48:18] and he's saying that's the tendency
[1:48:22] be reverent be holy love God and stand
[1:48:25] by him and as long as you know your life
[1:48:28] is divvying up with the Bible this is a
[1:48:30] long list now with purity of heart
[1:48:32] purity of thought love towards your
[1:48:35] brother trying your best to up build the
[1:48:37] kingdom of God doing all those things
[1:48:39] dressing right living right talking
[1:48:42] right going right places then you can
[1:48:46] have all the emotions you want to and
[1:48:48] everybody will believe it
[1:48:50] that's it
[1:48:52] but like I said don't not shout don't
[1:48:56] stop shouting because your life isn't
[1:48:58] perfect
[1:48:59] shout when he makes the change
[1:49:01] shout when you see growth shout when you
[1:49:03] see the answer shout when you see him
[1:49:04] working in your life
[1:49:06] listen sometimes we need to shout
[1:49:08] because we need change
[1:49:10] that's a part of worship
[1:49:13] Praises is is thanking him for what he's
[1:49:16] done worship is is is dwelling on what
[1:49:19] he is
[1:49:20] and sometimes we've got to worship for
[1:49:22] who he is and what he's promised to do
[1:49:24] before he ever does it and you can shout
[1:49:27] in the storm you can shout in a downtime
[1:49:29] you can shout when it seems like things
[1:49:31] aren't going right because you're
[1:49:32] believing the promise and you're
[1:49:34] thanking him for what he's done even
[1:49:36] though you can't see it amen
[1:49:38] let's look at another seducing Spirit
[1:49:40] now I've seen this one a lot and we have
[1:49:41] it in natural life not just in spiritual
[1:49:43] life it's human nature to do this done
[1:49:45] on myself many times
[1:49:46] he says how do you let go
[1:49:48] because this is what the Christian walk
[1:49:49] is about is Letting Go amen it's about
[1:49:51] letting the letting God have preeminence
[1:49:53] in your life he says how do you let go
[1:49:56] so many people are wondering today
[1:49:58] saying well brother Branham how do you
[1:49:59] let go I know you've heard a lot of
[1:50:01] theology on it let go a lot of people
[1:50:03] just work up a sweat trying to let go
[1:50:06] if I'm with this and and somebody says
[1:50:09] let go
[1:50:11] it's supposed to be that simple but he
[1:50:13] says you're sitting there and you're how
[1:50:15] do I let go how do I let go tell me
[1:50:18] brother how do I let go
[1:50:19] let go
[1:50:21] it's supposed to be like that but he
[1:50:23] says you put so much work into trying to
[1:50:24] do it
[1:50:26] just do it
[1:50:27] he says but look at what he says it
[1:50:29] looks like
[1:50:31] he says many people this is people
[1:50:33] working up a sweat trying to let go many
[1:50:35] people come around and say I was going
[1:50:37] to go on a 40-day fast so I can do
[1:50:39] something
[1:50:41] he said you don't need a 40-day fast you
[1:50:44] need to let go of the world and all
[1:50:45] these devilish things and take God's
[1:50:47] word in your heart
[1:50:49] you got to be taught how to do that you
[1:50:51] don't do it by jumping up and down
[1:50:52] neither do you do it on a 40-day fast
[1:50:54] you do it by a surrendered heart to
[1:50:57] almighty God
[1:51:00] what is it he says seek ye first the
[1:51:02] kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:51:04] not the kingdom of God and a little
[1:51:06] noise not the kingdom of God and a
[1:51:09] little emotion not the kingdom of God
[1:51:11] and a little this or that but God and
[1:51:13] his righteousness and all these other
[1:51:15] things will be added to you he says put
[1:51:18] it first
[1:51:20] so often what happens if you go to camp
[1:51:22] meetings or youth meetings or special
[1:51:24] services many times something happens in
[1:51:27] a service and people come out and they
[1:51:28] start to make these big promises and
[1:51:30] these big commitments and I'm going to
[1:51:32] do this and I'm going to do that and
[1:51:33] it's going to be this way and it's going
[1:51:35] to be that way and they start to do all
[1:51:37] of these things
[1:51:38] and you come talk to them a week or two
[1:51:40] or three or a month later and nothing's
[1:51:42] there they come out and because they
[1:51:45] want big impact or they believe in big
[1:51:47] impact or they want big changes or a big
[1:51:49] Ministry or something that really stands
[1:51:51] out and is noticeable they go and they
[1:51:53] do something big and impactful they make
[1:51:55] an extreme change and they say that's
[1:51:57] what's going to make the difference
[1:51:59] amen they look for extreme expressions
[1:52:01] of spirituality 40-day fast
[1:52:04] my wife did a a water fast one time for
[1:52:06] 21 days I think or something
[1:52:09] do you know what it takes to do a 40-day
[1:52:10] fast
[1:52:12] you can't do it physically very easy you
[1:52:15] need to be driven to it you need to be
[1:52:16] called to do something like that
[1:52:18] but he says we'll do these extreme
[1:52:20] things
[1:52:22] will commit to fasting for a few days or
[1:52:24] commit to doing more of this and more of
[1:52:26] this and we'll do these big grand
[1:52:27] gestures for God but we won't read our
[1:52:29] Bible and pray every day
[1:52:32] the results do not come from grand
[1:52:34] gestures
[1:52:35] the results come from consistent
[1:52:37] obedience
[1:52:38] consistent surrender that's what gets
[1:52:40] you there
[1:52:41] anything in life your spiritual walk
[1:52:43] with Christ that's how you get there if
[1:52:45] you want to control your weight it's
[1:52:47] consistent obedience you want your
[1:52:49] relationships to go well it's consistent
[1:52:51] focus on it it's doing the right thing
[1:52:53] constantly that's what gets you the
[1:52:55] results it's not a one moment thing
[1:52:58] now there's a one moment change the new
[1:53:00] birth is an experience in a moment but
[1:53:02] from then it's this constant thing
[1:53:04] that's going on and on and God works in
[1:53:06] those things and God does those things
[1:53:07] but he does it through a surrendered
[1:53:09] heart not through grand gestures if God
[1:53:12] wants you to go on a fast he'll tell you
[1:53:14] to go on a fast if God wants you to go
[1:53:16] somewhere and do something he'll open
[1:53:18] the door you don't have to sit there and
[1:53:19] say I'm going to do this for you and I'm
[1:53:21] going to do that for you just say Lord
[1:53:23] I'm willing to do whatever you ask me to
[1:53:24] do
[1:53:25] and pretty soon you'll find that that's
[1:53:27] what gets you into action it's because
[1:53:29] you're willing and surrendered not
[1:53:30] because you're the one that's making the
[1:53:32] grand gestures
[1:53:33] you don't have to put anything on you
[1:53:35] just have to surrender and be obedient
[1:53:36] and be willing and the rest will follow
[1:53:38] that's what he says seek ye first the
[1:53:40] kingdom of God the kingdom of God is the
[1:53:42] will of God for you here and now
[1:53:45] that's it seek that and everything else
[1:53:47] will be added everything else will
[1:53:48] follow through
[1:53:51] in Acts 13 or acts 4 verse 13 now this
[1:53:54] is after the day of Pentecost
[1:53:56] and this is the priests looking at Peter
[1:53:58] and John it says and when they saw the
[1:54:00] boldness of Peter and John and perceived
[1:54:02] that they were unlearned and ignorant
[1:54:04] men they marveled and they took
[1:54:07] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:54:08] with Jesus
[1:54:10] they noticed they were unlearned
[1:54:12] and they were ignorant
[1:54:15] and then they took notice that they had
[1:54:16] been with Jesus why
[1:54:19] am beholding the man which was healed
[1:54:21] standing with them they could say
[1:54:23] nothing against it
[1:54:25] why because the proof that they have
[1:54:27] been been with Jesus was right there the
[1:54:29] proof was in the pudding it was not in
[1:54:31] their delivery of their sermons but it
[1:54:33] was in the power of the Holy Ghost to do
[1:54:34] what Christ did in his ministry and it
[1:54:36] was standing in front of them and they
[1:54:37] could not say anything against it
[1:54:39] because the evidence defeated anything
[1:54:40] they could say they had a man there that
[1:54:43] had been healed that everybody knew had
[1:54:45] been lame for all of his life
[1:54:47] he was standing there what made the
[1:54:49] difference for Peter and John
[1:54:52] it wasn't Seminary it wasn't theology it
[1:54:55] was a new birth
[1:54:56] it was an experience with God that
[1:54:58] changed their life instantaneously
[1:55:01] listen Paul said what I I'm worried that
[1:55:04] you'll be beguiled away from the
[1:55:05] Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:55:07] it's not rocket science it's simple
[1:55:11] consistent obedience to the word of God
[1:55:14] that's it
[1:55:16] obedience will lead you to what God has
[1:55:18] for you every single time simple
[1:55:20] obedience
[1:55:22] like I said our inclination is to make
[1:55:24] the grand gestures rather than simply do
[1:55:26] what God asks us to do
[1:55:29] that's that's the human mentality
[1:55:31] let's make a big let's make a big thing
[1:55:33] out of it rather than just do the little
[1:55:35] things that he's asked us to do
[1:55:37] listen Peter and John weren't smart men
[1:55:39] they weren't educated they they aren't
[1:55:41] polished as far as we know but they were
[1:55:43] real Believers and they were real men of
[1:55:45] God because they had a new birth
[1:55:47] brother Brown said you're not even
[1:55:48] converted until you have the Holy Ghost
[1:55:51] that's what it is you're changed and
[1:55:54] you're changed and nothing of the old
[1:55:55] man is left you're a new creature you're
[1:55:57] a new creation in Christ
[1:55:58] Prophet God will put this way as as
[1:56:00] we're closing he says this
[1:56:03] let me be a brother
[1:56:05] let me live the example of what Christ
[1:56:08] said a man should be
[1:56:09] let me be a brother to a brother a
[1:56:12] brother to a sister let me be a minister
[1:56:14] to the ministers let me be an example of
[1:56:17] examples
[1:56:18] let me show to the world that this word
[1:56:21] is Christ he says the only way I can do
[1:56:24] it is to come into him because I can't
[1:56:26] do it myself and you can't do it but let
[1:56:28] the word in you become one then it lives
[1:56:32] itself out you are a walking Epistle of
[1:56:35] Jesus Christ when he's got total control
[1:56:38] of you to make every word
[1:56:41] if he comes this way and says I want to
[1:56:43] do this and you say no no I don't
[1:56:45] believe that see you're not in the word
[1:56:46] yet
[1:56:47] see full now watch fully now fully
[1:56:50] obedience to the whole word of God
[1:56:52] entitles us to the token when we pay
[1:56:55] when we pray we must have the token to
[1:56:59] present with our prayer amen God bless
[1:57:02] you if you stand
[1:57:09] Church we're not going anywhere without
[1:57:11] the Holy Spirit
[1:57:12] we're not achieving anything without the
[1:57:14] Holy Spirit we can sit under the
[1:57:16] preaching of this message all day every
[1:57:17] day and an angel could come in and blow
[1:57:19] a trumpet in our ear and we still
[1:57:21] wouldn't go in a Rapture if we don't
[1:57:23] have the Holy Ghost he's coming for a
[1:57:25] bride that's got oil in her vessel he's
[1:57:26] coming for a bride that's ready that
[1:57:28] she's prepared amen Jesus said my sheep
[1:57:31] know my voice
[1:57:33] and I know them
[1:57:34] and they follow me
[1:57:36] and a religious spirit is trying to get
[1:57:38] you to tune into another voice
[1:57:40] it's trying to get you to recognize
[1:57:42] something that isn't the word of God as
[1:57:44] if it is the word of God how do you
[1:57:46] fight that
[1:57:47] how do you fight that how do you know
[1:57:49] what's God or not how do you know when
[1:57:50] the holy spirit's truly leading you
[1:57:52] you've got to know what that voice first
[1:57:54] said
[1:57:54] you've got to know what he's already
[1:57:56] said to hear what he's saying today so
[1:57:58] you've got to get to the place where
[1:58:00] this becomes the first thing that rolls
[1:58:02] off of your lips
[1:58:03] and that puts a filter up in your mind
[1:58:05] whenever anything comes across your way
[1:58:07] you've got to know this inside and out
[1:58:09] you've got to be able to say it is
[1:58:11] written in every situation you're facing
[1:58:14] so that you can try every spirit
[1:58:17] every leading every unction every urge
[1:58:20] you have if you can pull it through this
[1:58:22] from front to back you know that's the
[1:58:25] Holy Spirit and if you can't it's a
[1:58:27] religious spirit trying to make you
[1:58:28] think it's God and it's leading you to
[1:58:30] destruction it's leading you to death
[1:58:32] it's leading you to a place that'll
[1:58:33] stunt your growth amen
[1:58:36] listen I'm not here to look at you I'm
[1:58:39] here to look at myself
[1:58:41] and tonight what I'm saying is look to
[1:58:42] yourself
[1:58:43] look inwardly that's what we're supposed
[1:58:46] to do we're supposed to judge ourselves
[1:58:47] we're not supposed to be looking around
[1:58:48] at other people we're supposed to look
[1:58:50] in and say Lord
[1:58:51] what needs to change
[1:58:53] has a religious spirit got in and told
[1:58:55] me it's okay to live with this thing
[1:58:58] has a religious told me it's okay to
[1:58:59] have this Habit to have this friendship
[1:59:01] to go these places to do these things to
[1:59:03] dress this way whatever it might be
[1:59:05] as something got in and told me
[1:59:07] something and this has clearly told me
[1:59:09] not to do it
[1:59:10] that's how you know a religious spirit
[1:59:12] has access into your life and we're all
[1:59:14] fighting it we're all fighting it none
[1:59:16] of us is exempt from it
[1:59:18] and remember we've got to know what did
[1:59:19] the voice say the first time
[1:59:21] all scripture is given by God it's
[1:59:23] inspired by God this is where we go back
[1:59:25] to amen not what I say not what an elder
[1:59:28] says we go back to this
[1:59:31] and that's how we know whether we're
[1:59:33] listening to the right voice amen
[1:59:34] let's bow our heads together
[1:59:37] Heavenly Father
[1:59:39] Lord we're thankful Lord that you sent a
[1:59:41] warning to us
[1:59:42] Lord that you gave us a filter that you
[1:59:44] gave us a a compass that points due
[1:59:47] north every time
[1:59:49] and Lord the scripture says that the the
[1:59:51] way is so easy that even a fool won't
[1:59:53] air in it Lord but we've got to be
[1:59:55] dwelling on your word we've got to be
[1:59:57] seeking it we've truly got to want to
[1:59:59] see your truth Heavenly Father
[2:00:00] Lord I'm praying your grace to keep us
[2:00:02] Lord from being seduced Lord from a
[2:00:04] religious spirit Lord that would let us
[2:00:06] stay in our current condition
[2:00:08] Lord may we not just be here to be
[2:00:10] petted or told we're good Lord but may
[2:00:12] we rise to the challenge of the
[2:00:14] preaching of the word Lord May Faith
[2:00:16] take hold Lord and may we be honest with
[2:00:18] ourselves
[2:00:19] Lord may we stand before you Lord if
[2:00:21] we've done it ignorantly Lord may we not
[2:00:23] make excuses and Lord if we've done it
[2:00:25] willfully may we repent Lord and ask
[2:00:27] your grace to not do it again
[2:00:30] Lord It's So Sly it's so slick out there
[2:00:33] Lord we pray that you will guard and
[2:00:35] keep us each one
[2:00:37] Lord let our hearts be tender towards
[2:00:39] the word
[2:00:39] Lord let our let our let our minds be
[2:00:42] quick to take on the mind of Christ Lord
[2:00:43] to surrender our will and and Desires in
[2:00:46] these things Lord that your word would
[2:00:48] have full effect we pray
[2:00:49] Lord bless us now we pray in Jesus
[2:00:51] Christ's name
