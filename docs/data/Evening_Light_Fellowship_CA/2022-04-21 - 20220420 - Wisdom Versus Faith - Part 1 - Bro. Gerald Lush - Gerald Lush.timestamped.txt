[1:07:41] praise the lord

[1:09:36] gets cold and it just fades away no no

[1:10:48] to have divine love
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:51] not filial
[1:10:53] but a copy
[1:10:55] for a greater love has no man
[1:10:59] than this
[1:11:00] that a man lay down his life for his
[1:11:03] friends god help us
[1:11:05] ye are my friends
[1:11:07] if

[1:11:30] same love for one another amen he's
[1:11:32] looking for us what to lay down our
[1:11:34] lives so brother sister it's not me

[1:11:39] doing this and doing that it's true oh
[1:11:40] my lord help us amen that is jesus doing

[1:11:51] one helping that one and again oh
[1:11:52] brother sister you're not doing it as as
[1:11:55] humans would do it for one another we're
[1:11:56] doing it as god would do it for us amen
[1:12:00] oh brother i pray grace that we have
[1:12:01] laid down our lives to that extent and
[1:12:04] that jesus has got control of our lives
[1:12:06] to that extent so that the life we live
[1:12:09] amen and the attitudes and and all that
[1:12:11] we have and all we're manifesting by the
[1:12:14] grace of god that it it's not our nature
[1:12:16] it's his nature amen it's not my life
[1:12:19] it's his life praise oh this is
[1:12:21] tremendous
[1:12:22] brother if i if i'm going to love you
[1:12:24] with his love this is going to be
[1:12:25] tremendous
[1:12:27] hallelujah because rather the devil is
[1:12:29] not going to be able to challenge that
[1:12:31] love and and to weaken that love not by
[1:12:33] any means no brother sister because if
[1:12:36] we got the love of god amen and we've
[1:12:38] got the love of god for one another
[1:12:40] brother i'll tell you this it's going to

[1:12:43] going to get stronger and stronger and
[1:12:45] stronger amen and brother that love do
[1:12:48] we have that love for one another to the
[1:12:50] extent that jesus had it for us
[1:12:52] amen in that in the bible according to
[1:12:54] the love of god the bible says that he
[1:12:56] laid down his life for us amen it was
[1:12:59] divine love in action
[1:13:01] amen that's what caused him to do what
[1:13:03] he did for us amen that's what causes
[1:13:06] him to do what he's doing for us amen it
[1:13:09] is divine love it is the love of god
[1:13:11] amen brother that brought him down to
[1:13:14] redeem us it is the love of god with us
[1:13:16] and in us amen with one another to take
[1:13:19] us back praise god oh brother i pray
[1:13:23] amen if there's ever anything that we
[1:13:25] need it is divine love

[1:14:01] love of god if the same love that that
[1:14:03] god showed us in jesus we're going to
[1:14:05] have the same attitude that jesus had
[1:14:08] we're going to have the same nature that

[1:14:13] life for us

[1:15:39] doctrine or that doctrine no brother it
[1:15:42] is uh it is the spirit that we have that

[1:19:46] highlighted it some years ago that there
[1:19:48] was one church age that he didn't do
[1:19:50] anything
[1:19:51] he couldn't
[1:19:53] and and they they wouldn't they wouldn't
[1:19:55] listen to him for that amen but he would
[1:19:58] say yea as god said but yea as god said
[1:20:02] but amen in all the church ages
[1:20:05] yeah you just go go into the book of
[1:20:07] revelation there chapter two chapter
[1:20:08] three and the different church ages and
[1:20:11] you'll see what what the enemy did in
[1:20:13] each age oh yeah
[1:20:15] and in another age there he he did
[1:20:18] certain thing and that's and that was
[1:20:20] basically that was around the third age
[1:20:22] right here and that's that's when he
[1:20:23] started to bring in organized religion
[1:20:25] denomination and so on oh yeah he tried
[1:20:28] to to change their doctrines and
[1:20:31] and a little here little there in the
[1:20:32] previous ages but he got a little
[1:20:34] further there amen and he was taking
[1:20:37] everything out from under the control of
[1:20:39] god and put it under the control of man
[1:20:42] yeah
[1:20:44] that was denominationalism
[1:20:46] amen they're coming under man's
[1:20:48] authority not god's authority amen oh
[1:20:51] yes
[1:20:52] maybe we and maybe we should go to go
[1:20:53] through that again sometime and show you
[1:20:55] what god did in the first stage what god
[1:20:58] did in the second age and the third lay
[1:21:00] on down and show you where the enemy
[1:21:02] came in brother as he came into adam and
[1:21:04] eve in the garden of eden there amen so
[1:21:07] he is coming to the to the church amen
[1:21:10] father down through the church ages and
[1:21:12] and he injected this and he injected
[1:21:14] that amen so
[1:21:16] and god
[1:21:17] there was there was an age there that
[1:21:18] god never never asked them to repent
[1:21:22] because they never listened to the devil
[1:21:24] amen but in all the other ages god said
[1:21:26] repent amen repent
[1:21:29] amen radar down truth to the church the
[1:21:32] last church age amen he said as many as
[1:21:35] i love i rebuke
[1:21:37] and chasten they zealous therefore and
[1:21:40] repent amen
[1:21:43] god called for repentance to this age
[1:21:44] this age there was two or three ages he
[1:21:46] didn't
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:48] he didn't call for repentance because
[1:21:50] because they didn't they didn't go off
[1:21:52] like all the other ages did into a false
[1:21:55] teaching the way the way that they did
[1:21:58] and he said remember therefore from
[1:21:59] whence the first age is to remember from
[1:22:02] whence thou art fallen and repent
[1:22:06] amen and
[1:22:08] show your repentance

[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:20] brother the prophet of god preached on
[1:22:21] wisdom versus faith you can have the
[1:22:23] wisdom of the word amen because the
[1:22:26] enemy is there the devil he got the
[1:22:28] wisdom of the word he knows the word you
[1:22:30] know what the bible says he knows what
[1:22:31] god said amen but he'll say but
[1:22:34] yeah i say unto thee but
[1:22:36] amen he'll get you to add he'll get you
[1:22:39] to to take away amen oh and he'll get
[1:22:42] you to put the answers on this but not
[1:22:43] on that oh yeah
[1:22:45] what is he doing he's using the word
[1:22:48] brother all down through he's used the
[1:22:50] word
[1:22:51] right from the beginning to the end
[1:22:53] satan is there to use the word
[1:22:55] god help us brother bro and he and
[1:22:58] there's the true prophet and then
[1:22:59] there's the false prophet
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:03] and the false prophet
[1:23:05] he's going to teach the word
[1:23:07] but he's going to add to it or take from
[1:23:09] it
[1:23:10] don't add to the word don't let the
[1:23:12] devil add to it in your life don't let
[1:23:14] the devil take away from it in your life
[1:23:17] leave it the way god put it
[1:23:19] amen and let god control your life by
[1:23:22] the word amen
[1:23:24] it's not you controlling the word god
[1:23:26] control the word controlling you
[1:23:28] amen but there's too many right brother
[1:23:31] it's too many it's controlling the word
[1:23:33] oh yeah all done true as did the enemy
[1:23:35] come in
[1:23:36] in all the ages there and and did this
[1:23:38] did this what for to get man into
[1:23:40] control not god trust man not god amen
[1:23:45] yes god said but i say unto you amen and
[1:23:48] he anointed them oh yeah he anointed
[1:23:50] them to do this you anointed to preach
[1:23:52] this teach this amen
[1:23:54] and that's why it all
[1:23:56] down through the ages that's why we see
[1:23:58] what happened when it comes to
[1:23:59] denominations
[1:24:01] organized religion
[1:24:04] and he said there in in that first
[1:24:05] church age he said nevertheless he said
[1:24:08] i have somewhat against me he
[1:24:09] acknowledged the good that they did he
[1:24:11] acknowledged oh yeah this is good that's
[1:24:13] good i appreciate this appreciate that
[1:24:15] but he said but i said nevertheless i
[1:24:17] have somewhat against thee or you did
[1:24:19] this you did that wonderful that's good
[1:24:21] but there's something you shouldn't have
[1:24:23] done
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:25] he said because thou has left thy first
[1:24:28] love
[1:24:30] or they're still religious
[1:24:32] they're still professing to be the
[1:24:34] church
[1:24:35] oh yeah they're still believing that
[1:24:36] jesus was their savior
[1:24:38] but he wasn't in control
[1:24:45] they were not expressing his love
[1:24:47] so he said remember therefore from
[1:24:49] whence thou art fallen
[1:24:51] and
[1:24:52] repent
[1:24:54] amen
[1:24:55] repent
[1:24:56] and brother and there's several churches
[1:24:59] there ages rather that that had to
[1:25:01] repent repent repent amen but there was
[1:25:05] one church age that didn't have to
[1:25:06] repent
[1:25:08] two maybe two
[1:25:12] yeah maybe two two that didn't have to
[1:25:14] repent
[1:25:15] i've gotten into that before
[1:25:18] so he said
[1:25:19] remember therefore from whence thou have
[1:25:22] fallen and repent and do the first works
[1:25:26] brother there's a generation of
[1:25:27] believers that are there to condemn
[1:25:28] denominationals oh you need to repent
[1:25:31] because your denomination you're this
[1:25:32] you're that well there's believers that
[1:25:34] need to repent
[1:25:36] amen brother because they've come they
[1:25:38] come out of that they come into the word
[1:25:40] the message of the hour and that they
[1:25:41] acknowledge this they acknowledge that
[1:25:43] amen but brother as as man did it back
[1:25:46] here under satan's influence change this
[1:25:48] added to this took away from that that's
[1:25:50] what many about so-called believer many
[1:25:52] even a preacher amended this adding to
[1:25:54] the message taken away from the message
[1:25:56] amen putting the emphasis on that and
[1:25:59] and and and taking away taking away the
[1:26:01] emphasis on something else god help us
[1:26:05] our faith is being challenged to believe
[1:26:08] the word

[1:26:11] believe the message of the hour amen
[1:26:14] because brother what god has done what

[1:37:28] believers are coming up and around the
[1:37:30] altar and praising the lord and and
[1:37:32] praying and so on and then

[1:37:37] ear and because there was a two
[1:37:39] believers came up they were adults and
[1:37:42] then as and they were

[1:37:46] praising the lord and so on
[1:37:48] and i said lord

[1:37:58] discernment the lord gave me and i felt
[1:38:00] it i didn't say anything to anybody i
[1:38:02] just left it and i just said lord i'll
[1:38:04] leave it with you and i move on and just

[1:38:08] left the message and they were gone back
[1:38:10] into the world
[1:38:12] what yeah they read those
[1:38:16] they were adults

[1:44:42] and then and after just after just a
[1:44:44] couple of minutes i was looking and
[1:44:46] looking and looking and then it faded
[1:44:50] it wasn't my imagination
[1:44:54] no no
[1:44:55] it was something that god did for a
[1:44:56] reason
[1:44:57] i was just a young man
[1:45:01] it wasn't in my thoughts
[1:45:03] no no
[1:45:05] i was just looking forward to going into
[1:45:06] the cottage meeting with brother sister
[1:45:08] burns and because we used to go in at
[1:45:10] that time and uh i wasn't ministering we
[1:45:13] were in and we just put out play a tape
[1:45:17] and i went in and i just explained to
[1:45:19] them what i saw oh my
[1:45:22] they thought they knew they felt it was
[1:45:24] the lord
[1:45:25] i said yeah i believe it's a god i said
[1:45:28] showing me something
[1:45:31] god help us
[1:45:33] i've had a number of those experiences
[1:45:35] done through the years
[1:45:37] for one of the days where there's it's
[1:45:38] not going to be just a vision
[1:45:41] no no we're going to go right on to you

[1:45:57] going to be
[1:45:59] amen god give us the faith
[1:46:01] that really really
[1:46:03] that's that's taking the taking the
[1:46:05] reality this whole world away from us
[1:46:08] and giving that the reality of heaven
[1:46:11] the reality of the new heaven and new
[1:46:12] earth it will get more and more real
[1:46:18] brother
[1:46:19] god help us
[1:46:20] just think
[1:46:23] i don't have the time to go and go into
[1:46:25] these thoughts on on faith
[1:46:27] concerning faith
[1:46:29] and i was just thinking about it and i
[1:46:30] said oh my
[1:46:32] by faith abel
[1:46:34] offered unto god a more excellent
[1:46:36] sacrifice
[1:46:38] faith
[1:46:40] yeah
[1:46:42] what did he do
[1:46:44] oh where did he get that
[1:46:47] well somewhere
[1:46:49] what what what where did where did abel
[1:46:51] get the attitude that he had and where
[1:46:53] did cain get the attitude that he had
[1:46:57] abel must have been thinking different
[1:46:59] he must have been under a different
[1:47:01] conviction
[1:47:02] it had to be a conviction
[1:47:04] to do what he did
[1:47:06] to offer the sacrifice he offered and it
[1:47:08] was the more excellent sacrifice
[1:47:11] as i said consider you know what cain
[1:47:13] offered
[1:47:14] but no let's see what abel offered where
[1:47:18] did he get that what was he thinking
[1:47:20] about
[1:47:22] what was his conviction
[1:47:25] but it was by faith
[1:47:26] so let it be a conviction
[1:47:29] in his heart in his soul
[1:47:30] amen that no doubt he mine where'd he
[1:47:34] get the revelation of the garden of eden
[1:47:36] where'd he get the revelation of what
[1:47:38] happened to adam and eve
[1:47:40] in the garden
[1:47:46] and brother
[1:47:49] what happened to adam and eve well the
[1:47:51] lord that must have took him
[1:47:53] and and and abel was out there and he
[1:47:55] was going around maybe outside the
[1:47:57] garden
[1:47:58] and no doubt he had because he was the
[1:48:00] seed of god amen because he was a son of
[1:48:04] god he had that conviction
[1:48:07] no doubt in his heart and in his soul
[1:48:09] oh yeah
[1:48:11] and but now cain was different king just
[1:48:13] went went and did this and he planted
[1:48:15] this and planted that oh this is
[1:48:16] wonderful this is wonderful
[1:48:18] yeah thank you lord
[1:48:20] yeah
[1:48:21] but but abel was different
[1:48:24] he must he had lambs and lambs and sheep
[1:48:27] and whatever
[1:48:28] so he just if the burden was there that
[1:48:31] he would that he would take one of the
[1:48:32] lambs and slay them
[1:48:36] now where did he where did he get that
[1:48:38] conviction
[1:48:42] cain never read it
[1:48:44] cain condemned abel for doing it
[1:48:47] cain felt that abel shouldn't have done
[1:48:49] what he did in killing that lamb
[1:48:54] cain felt that he was he did the best
[1:48:56] you know he didn't kill anything he just
[1:48:58] took he took what he had grown and and
[1:49:00] just laid that on the altar
[1:49:02] he gave this to the lord that to the
[1:49:03] lord but
[1:49:05] abel's faith was different abel's
[1:49:08] revelation was different
[1:49:12] luther's revelation was different
[1:49:14] wesley's pentecostal others down through
[1:49:16] the ages that god did god used
[1:49:19] oh yeah
[1:49:21] so different that it brought total
[1:49:23] separation
[1:49:25] from the rest of the world
[1:49:29] and brother what god has done for us is
[1:49:31] bringing a greater and greater
[1:49:32] separation god help us
[1:49:36] amen not to compromise
[1:49:39] stay with the word
[1:49:42] and brother
[1:49:43] oh they consider us fanatics because we
[1:49:46] left denominations to believe the word
[1:49:48] yeah to believe the message and we get
[1:49:50] together and we believe this doctrine
[1:49:51] this doctrine you know but now
[1:49:54] brother sister there ought to be a
[1:49:55] greater and greater separation because
[1:49:57] what for for the resurrection and the
[1:49:59] rapture
[1:50:02] god separated them all down through the
[1:50:04] ages and what for to bring forth the
[1:50:06] message
[1:50:07] for luther to bring forth the message in
[1:50:08] wesley the pentecostals and yes even the
[1:50:11] salvation army as i said that the
[1:50:14] prophet of god said that god raised up
[1:50:15] william booth where he had read out
[1:50:17] salvation because the why he said
[1:50:19] because pentecost it organized so
[1:50:21] quickly
[1:50:23] after the pentecostal revival he said he
[1:50:25] had to raise up william booth
[1:50:28] red-hot salvation
[1:50:30] god help us
[1:50:32] and where are we now
[1:50:35] where are we now
[1:50:37] after the what it's been what 60 years
[1:50:39] since the prophet of god has been gone
[1:50:41] i'm close to it
[1:50:47] where's our faith
[1:50:49] what faith do we have
[1:50:51] what are we living for
[1:50:55] what's controlling us now
[1:50:57] in our thoughts and our words indeed
[1:50:59] what's what's governing us are
[1:51:01] motivating us
[1:51:02] when it comes to church
[1:51:04] going to church and doing this and doing
[1:51:06] that what's our testimony what's our
[1:51:07] witness
[1:51:10] oh
[1:51:12] lutheran then they went and testified of
[1:51:14] justification other sanctification the
[1:51:17] baptism of the holy ghost they give to
[1:51:18] the spirit but even even has gone from
[1:51:21] them now
[1:51:23] they certainly lost lost the influence
[1:51:25] of it
[1:51:26] gone
[1:51:28] but brother what about the bride of
[1:51:30] christ
[1:51:32] concerning what god has done in the last
[1:51:34] days

[1:54:01] looking for in the last stage and
[1:54:04] brothers response god's looking for in
[1:54:05] the bride

[1:54:08] done through the message of the hour
[1:54:10] through the messenger of the hour amen
[1:54:13] brother is to humble us to repentance
[1:54:16] i tell you
[1:54:18] if
[1:54:19] when it comes to going in the
[1:54:20] resurrection rapture oh praise the lord
[1:54:22] we're going home

[1:54:48] amen i write spirit and right attitude
[1:54:50] toward what god has done and is doing
[1:54:54] and there's a reason
[1:54:57] to get us to look up he puts us down
[1:55:00] praise the lord
[1:55:02] and he said
[1:55:06] oh god elvis
[1:55:10] oh brother that's the lava to see an age
[1:55:12] don't worry about that well but it's a
[1:55:14] spirit that goes right on through
[1:55:16] religion and there's many have come out
[1:55:19] but they've still got that spirit that
[1:55:20] they came out of
[1:55:22] from denominations
[1:55:25] even message believers yeah even messy
[1:55:26] believers
[1:55:29] brother branham was dealing with that
[1:55:32] from his own pulpit
[1:55:36] i can i just go so far with that
[1:55:39] concerning certain things that providers
[1:55:41] said certain things that he has preached
[1:55:43] from his own pulpit
[1:55:47] and why in the world
[1:55:51] would so-called believers leave
[1:55:54] brother branham's church
[1:55:58] and
[1:55:59] go to another brother's church
[1:56:02] oh yeah many believers did professing
[1:56:05] believers because the probably god
[1:56:06] preached this he preached that for the
[1:56:08] most part he was always traveling
[1:56:11] but there's a few times eventually that
[1:56:13] he had to stay he had to make sure that
[1:56:15] he went into his own church and he would
[1:56:17] minister this and minister that
[1:56:23] he would you would correct them with the
[1:56:25] word and they couldn't take correction
[1:56:29] that's why many of them left the church
[1:56:32] still professing to be believers
[1:56:34] but they moved out moved on what
[1:56:38] this was the prophet
[1:56:40] you believed them to be a prophet
[1:56:43] they believed him to be a prophet
[1:56:45] and wouldn't stay under his ministry
[1:56:49] they went into another brothers ministry
[1:56:50] that's the other brother that they went
[1:56:53] to he believed brother brown was a
[1:56:54] prophet and he preached it that way
[1:56:57] god help us
[1:56:59] this is how sincere it is
[1:57:01] and this is how confusing the age that
[1:57:03] we're living in is
[1:57:04] don't be diseased be not deceived
[1:57:10] don't let the devil deceive you into
[1:57:11] thinking well you're a believer you
[1:57:13] believe this you believe that don't
[1:57:14] worry about it
[1:57:16] let's make your calling and your
[1:57:17] election sure
[1:57:20] amen
[1:57:22] settle all the questions
[1:57:24] amen
[1:57:27] again
[1:57:29] let me read it
[1:57:31] concerning this age
[1:57:33] and we're dealing with those we're not
[1:57:35] in denomination but we're still dealing
[1:57:36] with those spirits
[1:57:39] yep
[1:57:41] and unto the angel of the church of the
[1:57:43] laodiceans right
[1:57:46] these things saith the amen
[1:57:50] the faithful and true witness the
[1:57:52] beginning of the creation of god
[1:57:55] i know thy works
[1:57:58] that thou art neither cold nor
[1:58:02] hot
[1:58:04] are you cold
[1:58:06] are you hot
[1:58:09] or lukewarm
[1:58:12] if you're not cold you're not hot you're
[1:58:13] lukewarm
[1:58:21] he said i would
[1:58:22] that thou were cold
[1:58:24] or hot
[1:58:28] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[1:58:31] neither cold or hot i will spew thee out
[1:58:34] of my mouth
[1:58:37] let's get into a relationship with jesus
[1:58:40] that's hot
[1:58:43] amen not lukewarm
[1:58:46] amen not cold
[1:58:48] but hot
[1:58:51] and he said because thou sayest
[1:58:54] i am rich
[1:58:55] and increased with goods
[1:58:57] and have need of nothing
[1:58:59] and knoweth not that thou art wretched
[1:59:02] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:59:05] naked
[1:59:08] i counsel thee to buy me gold
[1:59:11] tried in the fire
[1:59:13] that thou mayest be rich and wait
[1:59:16] raymond that thou mayest be clothed
[1:59:19] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:59:22] not appear
[1:59:23] and a night thine eyes with i said that
[1:59:26] thou mayest see
[1:59:28] amen god help us
[1:59:32] as many as i love i rebuke
[1:59:35] and chasten
[1:59:37] be zealous therefore and repent
[1:59:41] for behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:59:45] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:59:48] door i will come into him and will sub
[1:59:51] with him and e with me amen
[1:59:54] he's knocking through the preaching of
[1:59:56] the word through the ministry of the
[1:59:59] word he's knocking
[2:00:00] open the door let him in
[2:00:02] amen let him in
[2:00:05] amen and be there to read it ready to
[2:00:07] receive what he's what he's trying to
[2:00:08] teach you
[2:00:10] about yourself
[2:00:12] amen see apply the word to yourself
[2:00:16] in the ministry of the word apply it to
[2:00:18] your own life
[2:00:19] don't think oh praise the lord that's
[2:00:21] wonderful brother keep preaching amen
[2:00:25] but it's all intellectual knowledge it's
[2:00:27] like doctrine and so on
[2:00:29] no no
[2:00:31] it's got to be a personal relationship
[2:00:32] between you and god

[2:00:38] as an individual god is working on you
[2:00:41] god is god is what for working on your
[2:00:44] faith what for he wants to
[2:00:47] take out the unbelief and bring more and

[2:03:50] believers in the ukraine
[2:03:53] and he's been of course he's been there
[2:03:55] even recently to poland and maybe the
[2:03:57] ukraine
[2:03:59] to visit believers
[2:04:01] there to encourage believers
[2:04:04] keep them in prayer
[2:04:06] because i tell you the hour's coming
[2:04:08] when it's going to get worse and worse
[2:04:10] and worse around the world
[2:04:15] look up
[2:04:16] our redemption is drawing near
[2:04:20] the rapture
[2:04:22] by the grace of god the bible warns us
[2:04:24] when you see this see this see this this
[2:04:27] going on that's going on don't look down
[2:04:29] look out
[2:04:31] don't get discouraged encourage
[2:04:33] with the word
[2:04:35] the promise of the resurrection the
[2:04:36] promise of the rapture is getting closer
[2:04:40] it's right there
[2:04:42] god help us
[2:04:45] amen
[2:04:49] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[2:04:51] sit with me in my throne even as also i
[2:04:54] also overcame and am set down with my
[2:04:57] father in israel
[2:04:59] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:05:01] the spirit saith unto the churches
[2:05:04] led i pray god that you'll hear what the
[2:05:07] spirit is saying to the bride of christ
[2:05:09] amen get ready look up
[2:05:11] because the our redemption has come by
[2:05:14] the grace of god
[2:05:16] it's one thing to have wisdom another
[2:05:18] thing to have faith
[2:05:20] you can have the wisdom of even to know
[2:05:22] the the knowledge of the bible to know
[2:05:24] the knowledge of the message and all
[2:05:25] that but what about the faith that it's
[2:05:27] ordained to give us
[2:05:30] there's a lot of people know the message
[2:05:32] oh they know this message they know that
[2:05:35] message they know the bible and someone
[2:05:37] comes in but they don't have the faith
[2:05:39] that that it that it's ordained to give
[2:05:42] why because they got it in their head
[2:05:44] but not in their
[2:05:46] heart the bible says thy word have i hid
[2:05:49] in mine heart
[2:05:52] not your head
[2:05:53] your heart
[2:05:54] he says lord that i might not sin
[2:05:56] against you
[2:05:57] disbelieve you lord or doubt you
[2:06:00] put it in the heart so the word is in
[2:06:02] control
[2:06:04] by the grace of god
[2:06:05] and that we are controlled by the word
[2:06:07] of god amen
[2:06:10] by the grace of god
[2:06:13] there are thoughts here i want to
[2:06:14] express but we'll leave that for another
[2:06:16] service concerning wisdom versus faith
[2:06:20] amen
[2:06:21] it's one thing to have wisdom another
[2:06:23] thing that faith
[2:06:24] the grace of god
[2:06:28] the faith that believes god yes
[2:06:30] but the faith that trusts god yes
[2:06:33] and faith that obeys god
[2:06:37] amen it's one thing to believe in god
[2:06:39] and to believe in god
[2:06:42] another thing they well i trust god do
[2:06:44] you
[2:06:46] you can say you trust him
[2:06:48] but do you obey him
[2:06:50] amen
[2:06:52] because your your obedience is going to
[2:06:54] be a testimony of your trust
[2:06:57] by the grace of god
[2:06:59] so god help us brother
[2:07:01] is my prayer
[2:07:02] to believe god trust god and obey god
[2:07:06] amen especially concerning the hour that
[2:07:08] we're living in
[2:07:10] for the resurrection and the rapture
[2:07:12] god help us
[2:07:13] we thank the lord for the word but lord
[2:07:15] help us to move on to the faith that the
[2:07:17] words ordained to give
[2:07:20] not just to have the wisdom of this of
[2:07:22] the doctrines the wisdom of this
[2:07:23] teaching and that teaching but brother
[2:07:25] let's have the faith
[2:07:27] that god is looking for
[2:07:29] in this age
[2:07:35] thank god for the faith in all the other
[2:07:37] ages
[2:07:38] but now brother god's looking for the
[2:07:40] faith in this age
[2:07:42] and
[2:07:43] oh my if he's looking for anything else
[2:07:45] it is the baptism of divine love
[2:07:52] and he he's allowing this to go on and
[2:07:54] on and on he's allowing this to happen
[2:07:57] that to having what he's going to bring
[2:07:58] out the love that the bride's got for
[2:08:01] one another
[2:08:02] one thing the love that they got for him
[2:08:05] but if you've got love for him like i
[2:08:06] said you would have love for one another
[2:08:09] and he wants to bring that out
[2:08:14] lovest thou me
[2:08:15] more than these

[2:09:26] and
[2:09:29] they were wondering what
[2:09:32] what does he mean

[2:09:37] the resurrection is on
[2:09:39] the rapture's on
[2:09:41] no
[2:09:42] he's leaving the impression he's been
[2:09:44] resurrected and he's been raptured

[2:09:53] there was maybe three or four hundred
[2:09:55] people there

[2:09:58] the pastor he was sitting there sitting
[2:10:01] on the right side there and he just
[2:10:03] turned around looked at his audience and
[2:10:04] he
[2:10:05] he's shaking his head
[2:10:08] i said lord you don't agree with it

[2:10:15] revelation of it to explain what i meant
[2:10:17] by i am resurrected and i am raptured
[2:10:21] oh
[2:10:22] then the pastor turned around
