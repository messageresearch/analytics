[42:55] World world we pray Lord be with us now
[42:58] forgive us Lord forgive me where I fall
[43:01] short Lord we want you Lord we want you
[43:04] to have preeminence Lord we want you to
[43:07] have your way in our lives Lord let us
[43:10] surrender a new to you we pray in Jesus
[43:12] Christ's name we're asking it amen amen
[43:16] God bless you amen wonderful song
[43:18] service this morning praise the Lord for
[43:20] that amen it's good to see sun shining
[43:24] out amen it's cold cold and it's windy
[43:27] but the sun is shining and you know what
[43:29] sometimes we need just that sun no
[43:30] matter what amen God bless you this
[43:32] morning good to see sister Elise Columbo
[43:34] with us amen God bless you Sister amen I
[43:37] got a a message from Brother Andrew Dodd
[43:39] last night and he confirmed with me he's
[43:41] booked his tickets for February 23rd
[43:43] through the 25th and he said he'll bring
[43:45] his wife Melissa with him as well so
[43:47] we're thankful for that we always
[43:48] appreciate it when the ministers bring
[43:50] their wives and we find they enjoy it
[43:52] more and they're more relaxed and and
[43:54] the wives talk to my wife and you know
[43:56] lets us know what they want and what
[43:57] they like and these things and so we
[43:59] kind of have a go between that makes
[44:00] everything go smoothly so I I was
[44:02] excited to get that text when I woke up
[44:04] this morning so just trusting that God
[44:06] will bless those Services amen God bless
[44:09] you if we would turn to Matthew chapter
[44:10] 11 Matthew chapter 11 this
[44:14] morning verse 28 says come unto me all
[44:17] ye that labor and are heavy laden and I
[44:20] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[44:23] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[44:25] in heart and ye shall find rest unto
[44:28] your souls for my yoke is easy and my
[44:32] burden is light amen God bless you you
[44:34] can have your seats this morning we took
[44:36] a bit of a detour last service on the
[44:38] series on manifesting time but I want to
[44:41] come back to that thought on that we
[44:42] read about in second Peter chapter 1 for
[44:45] so long ago when we talked about add to
[44:47] your brotherly kindness charity amen we
[44:49] know that's Divine love it's agape love
[44:51] it's it's the the Holy Ghost itself and
[44:54] we spoke on many things about it we know
[44:55] know it's the Capstone we know it's the
[44:57] seal we know it's the finishing work of
[44:58] the believer's life and it's nothing
[45:00] less than the holy spirit it's a life of
[45:03] Christ in us and we talked about
[45:05] perfection and we talked about freedom
[45:07] and we talked about light and we talked
[45:08] about fearlessness but I want to take it
[45:10] to another direction again this morning
[45:12] and we're talking about this charity
[45:13] we're talking about what the Holy Ghost
[45:16] is and what it does and I want to take a
[45:18] a thought this morning on you shall find
[45:20] rest amen you shall find rest and we
[45:22] know that the nature of the holy spirit
[45:24] is rest and I want to walk you through
[45:26] the scriptures mostly this morning and
[45:28] then on the next service maybe we'll go
[45:29] more into the quote side of things but I
[45:31] want to just set a foundation for this
[45:33] thought on rest and you shall find rest
[45:35] this morning and if we go back into
[45:37] Isaiah chapter 28 it says Whom Shall he
[45:40] teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make
[45:42] to understand Doctrine he says it's them
[45:45] that are weaned from the milk and drawn
[45:48] from the breast now we know that that's
[45:49] what babies
[45:51] eat so you can stay where it's easy and
[45:54] you can stay where everything's provided
[45:56] or you can step up into where a place
[45:58] where it's a little bit more difficult
[46:00] where you've got to eat more solid food
[46:02] you've got to chew your food it doesn't
[46:04] maybe slide down our throat so easily
[46:05] it's not quite so easy to digest and to
[46:08] work into our system but he says that's
[46:10] what it's going to take to move into
[46:12] what he's talking about in Isaiah 28
[46:15] amen we've got to be able to take what
[46:16] God has for us we've got to be able to
[46:18] grow as he provides and ask us to do
[46:20] these different things and we have to
[46:22] come into maturity and you'll find with
[46:24] the believer it's a willful maturity
[46:26] we've got to be willing to move forward
[46:28] amen we've got to be willing to take a
[46:29] little more work to get our nutrition
[46:32] because it's at a higher level and it'll
[46:33] take us to a greater place he says for
[46:36] precept must be upon precept precept
[46:38] upon precept line upon line line upon
[46:41] line here a little and there a little
[46:43] it's not fast but it's simple amen it's
[46:46] just a little bit every day it's a
[46:47] little bit of growth it's a little bit
[46:48] of maturing it's a little bit of the
[46:50] word becoming real to you we'll see as
[46:52] we go through this amen but it's also a
[46:54] little bit of letting go every day it's
[46:56] a little bit of trusting every day it's
[46:58] a little bit more believing every day
[47:00] amen and it's that little steps as we
[47:02] talked about last service that's little
[47:04] steps every day get you further than one
[47:06] big step occasionally amen it's that day
[47:08] after day after day and what Isaiah is
[47:10] talking about here and it's the Lord
[47:11] speaking is he's speaking of the word
[47:14] amen the word feeds and grows us and
[47:16] it's a little bit by a little bit amen
[47:18] we don't tend to take big leaps those
[47:20] are circumstances and those are
[47:22] experiences we have with God but every
[47:24] day is not that way every day it's just
[47:26] a little bit here and a little bit there
[47:28] but then he says for with stammering
[47:30] lips and another tongue will he speak to
[47:33] the people so catch this now this is
[47:35] looking to the Future where there's
[47:37] going to be a supernatural event and he
[47:39] says you'll recognize the event by what
[47:41] happens with the way that the people are
[47:43] talking and he says it's going to be
[47:44] stammering lips and it's going to be
[47:46] with with with unkown another tongue
[47:48] that he speaks to the people and watch
[47:50] what he says this is he says this event
[47:53] not the tongues not the language but
[47:55] this event he says to whom he said this
[47:58] is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
[48:01] weary to rest and this is the refreshing
[48:05] he says yet they would not hear he's
[48:07] looking forward to the future he says
[48:09] there's a rest coming he tells them how
[48:11] they're going to know it's there and
[48:13] then he says but they won't accept it
[48:15] it's an amazing thing that everything
[48:16] they're looking for is coming they have
[48:18] a sign of what is going to be and yet he
[48:21] says they're going to turn it down amen
[48:24] he says they're not going to Hear It
[48:25] They'll they'll reject it but I want to
[48:27] focus on two words here in verse 12 he
[48:29] says that this is the rest and then he
[48:33] says this is the refreshing so the rest
[48:36] means a resting place and a quietness
[48:39] but I want you to see that refreshing
[48:41] means rest Repose and a place to rest so
[48:45] rest is a place to rest and refreshing
[48:47] is a place to rest amen Isaiah says
[48:50] there's a there's a rest that's coming
[48:52] to the weary and it will also cause a
[48:55] refresh refeshing so there's a rest that
[48:57] comes first and there's a refreshing
[48:58] that comes after it amen first we're
[49:01] weary and that word weary means faint
[49:04] exhausted tired out and that's us before
[49:07] the New Birth man that's what we are
[49:09] we're working we're weary amen sometimes
[49:12] we don't even realize how worn out we
[49:13] are and then we come and we realize
[49:16] we've been carrying a burden you know
[49:18] Paul bunan wrote that book Pilgrims
[49:20] Progress remember and he didn't realize
[49:22] the burden that was there until he
[49:24] started walking and as soon as he went
[49:26] on a journey he realized what that
[49:28] burden was and it wasn't until he came
[49:30] to Calvary that he lost that
[49:32] burden but Calvary is not the new birth
[49:36] that's just the starting point he says
[49:38] there's a rest that comes after all of
[49:40] that that's not the rest that's a relief
[49:42] but it's not the rest that we're talking
[49:44] about and even as professing Christians
[49:46] we're believing unto something until we
[49:48] get the new birth and there's a
[49:50] weariness that can come with that
[49:52] because you're believing unto something
[49:54] but you don't have it you're trusting
[49:56] the word of God you're expressing your
[49:58] faith in the word of God you're living
[50:00] by the word of God but you don't have
[50:02] that reality inside of you yet until you
[50:04] get the Holy Ghost and that can be
[50:06] wearing that can be tiring because
[50:09] you're believing for something you don't
[50:11] yet have and that's the the work the
[50:13] labor so often for the professing
[50:15] Christian and we'll see even for the
[50:17] real Christian is that we're believing
[50:19] for something we don't have and we can
[50:21] get tired and we can get worn and we can
[50:23] get depressed and we can get all these
[50:25] things
[50:26] as we're waiting for what we're
[50:27] believing for amen but then the new
[50:29] birth comes and that's when we're first
[50:31] at rest see first we experience rest
[50:35] that's the first thing that comes is
[50:36] rest is you finally get what you've been
[50:39] believing for all of this time and as
[50:42] soon as you do it you have rest why
[50:44] because it's a sealed work it's a
[50:46] finished work brother Brandon would
[50:47] teach us that that Holy Ghost when you
[50:49] get that Holy Ghost it's done it's done
[50:52] your soul is sealed to the day of
[50:54] redemption and you don't have to worry
[50:56] anymore so there's a rest on your soul
[50:58] right there but we know that once the
[51:00] soul is sealed there's still a work that
[51:02] has to go on in in the spirit and In the
[51:05] Flesh and there's a rest that has to be
[51:07] able to come and progress throughout
[51:09] your body throughout your your nature
[51:11] throughout your personality and these
[51:12] things and that's the refreshing that's
[51:14] going to come after that as we'll see as
[51:16] we go through amen but the first times
[51:18] it comes as a rest and it changes our
[51:20] attitude it changes our approach it
[51:22] changes our Outlook and we can finally
[51:24] go
[51:27] and you you just let your load off and
[51:28] you just you're you're so the F when you
[51:31] first get the Holy Ghost it's an exper I
[51:33] don't even know how to explain it but
[51:35] you're just
[51:36] satisfied and it's like you're content
[51:38] it's like you don't have a worry in the
[51:41] world but then worries come don't they
[51:44] and works come and and struggles come
[51:47] and labors come and Trials come and
[51:48] that's why we need not just a rest but
[51:51] we need a refreshing that comes after
[51:53] the rest amen this this this taste that
[51:56] we get the new birth the Holy Ghost on
[51:58] us that first in filling it gives us a
[52:00] taste of rest to know what is available
[52:03] to know what is possible to the believer
[52:05] on a daily basis amen because brother
[52:08] Ron would say he says there's one
[52:10] infilling but there's many
[52:12] refilling that means there's a rest and
[52:15] then there's a bringing back to rest
[52:17] that's available to the believer amen
[52:19] when we're at rest we're at peace and
[52:21] we're satisfied we're content we're
[52:23] quiet we're relaxed we're not or
[52:25] harassed nothing is is bothering us when
[52:28] we're at rest somebody's that that's at
[52:30] rest doesn't want to be brought out of
[52:32] resten if there's anything I would want
[52:35] to do it's rest that's what we're
[52:37] seeking is it is rest amen but then
[52:40] Isaiah says there's going to be a
[52:42] refreshing that follows this rest now
[52:44] that refresh means anything you put re
[52:46] in front of means make what you had
[52:48] again so refresh means I'll make you
[52:51] fresh again I'll make it like it was the
[52:54] first time I'll give you the experience
[52:56] of the first time amen and you you used
[52:59] to be fresh you used to be energetic
[53:01] those of us that are not young anymore
[53:03] we're tired
[53:04] now and then we work and we work and we
[53:07] work and then what do we do we rest
[53:09] every night and we wake up and we're
[53:11] refreshed we're ready to go again we're
[53:13] rejuvenated we have the energy that we
[53:15] had the day before but the problem in
[53:17] this flesh is that we lose a little bit
[53:19] every night we wake up and it's infant
[53:22] in infantes smal it it's just a tiny bit
[53:25] less but every day we lose a little bit
[53:27] of what we've got and we wake up and we
[53:30] say well I'm ready to go but we can do a
[53:32] little bit less every day than we did
[53:33] the day before why cuz this body is
[53:35] dying it's going away but what Isaiah is
[53:39] saying is that after this rest comes
[53:40] there's a refreshing that's always
[53:42] available to the believer amen it's a
[53:44] place of Refuge a place where you can be
[53:46] at peace and rest and you can charge up
[53:48] again amen and there's no limit to the
[53:51] refreshing you know what I love I love
[53:54] finger foods
[53:57] you know I love the brisket brother B
[53:59] Matt makes and I love burgers and that
[54:01] but I love when it's just a bunch of
[54:03] little things that you can just go take
[54:05] all the time they call them Refreshments
[54:07] don't they because you can eat them all
[54:09] day long I love
[54:11] Refreshments but I love
[54:14] refreshing and man when I go hunting for
[54:16] 5 days and I come back and I haven't
[54:17] showered yet you know what's refreshing
[54:19] a shower just to get cleaned up again
[54:22] you know brother bam talks about he says
[54:24] that scoured out feeling the first time
[54:27] God does a work and and he cleans out
[54:29] your life that scoured out feeling and
[54:32] you know what happens is sometimes we
[54:33] don't get we don't stay quite so clean
[54:36] and then what happens is we get an
[54:37] evangelist roll through or maybe the
[54:39] pastor shifts out of his regular gift
[54:41] and he preaches an Evangel Evangelical
[54:43] sermon and what happens is it brings
[54:45] what a sweeping of the holy spirit in
[54:47] and it scours us out again and we get to
[54:49] feel again what we felt the first time
[54:51] he cleansed us of our sins then Jesus
[54:53] talked about we're walking through life
[54:55] that's why we wash our feet only because
[54:57] we walk through a dirty world and things
[54:59] dirty us up sometimes we need that
[55:01] scouring up but you have to get the
[55:02] first one before you can get the ones
[55:04] that follow behind it that keep you
[55:06] because you know what that feeling is
[55:07] amen it's like the vehicles they have
[55:10] today we've got plug in hybrids and
[55:11] electric vehicles and guess what they
[55:14] run out of battery but all you have to
[55:16] do is plug them in overnight and the
[55:17] next morning they got everything they've
[55:18] always had and you can go on a trip
[55:21] again that's what's available to the
[55:23] believer if you've ever gotten it it's
[55:26] always available again amen you remember
[55:29] David said restore to me the joy of my
[55:31] salvation he hadn't lost his salvation
[55:33] but he lost the joy that accompanied it
[55:36] and sometimes that's all we need is we
[55:37] need the feeling of what we actually
[55:39] have we need feelings we we need to know
[55:42] we need to be have things associated
[55:45] with us so that we know that God's with
[55:46] us but it's not in the feelings but
[55:48] don't lose the feelings anden I know my
[55:51] wife loves me but God help me if I don't
[55:52] feel like she loves me that's when
[55:55] trouble's going to happen isn't it I've
[55:56] got to feel that she loves me not just
[55:58] know it but there's something that comes
[55:59] with it amen so there's available to a
[56:01] Believer not just a rest but a
[56:03] refreshing a restoring to that rest on a
[56:06] daily basis and Isaiah says it's going
[56:08] to come through a supernatural
[56:10] experience and we know that was what
[56:12] that was and it's in Acts 2 it says and
[56:14] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[56:16] they were all with one Accord in one
[56:18] place and suddenly there came a sound
[56:20] from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind
[56:23] and it filled all the house where they
[56:24] were sitting and there appeared unto
[56:26] them clothing tongues like as of fire
[56:28] and it sat upon each of them and they
[56:31] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[56:33] began to speak with other tongues as the
[56:37] spirit gave them utterance notice this
[56:39] is inspired speaking not desired
[56:43] speaking because you can have a gift of
[56:45] tongues and you can choose to use that
[56:47] or not use that we had a sister back in
[56:49] Texas she would go into a prayer closet
[56:51] she could speak in tongues anytime she
[56:53] wanted she'd pray in tongues that was
[56:54] that was a gift that God had given her
[56:56] and that was subject to her like every
[56:58] gift is it's subject to the spirit of
[57:01] the Prophet it's subject to the person
[57:03] that it's on but this is not that but
[57:05] rather as the holy spirit gives these
[57:07] people the ability to speak then they
[57:09] would speak in unknown tongues and they
[57:12] would speak in tongues so they would
[57:14] speak in unknown languages meaning
[57:17] speaking a Heavenly language and then
[57:18] they would also speak in unknown
[57:20] languages that they were never taught so
[57:22] you might have had you know a Jew and
[57:23] he's speaking Persian and another one
[57:25] Speaking Greek and they never went to
[57:27] school and learned it but as the Holy
[57:29] Spirit fell on them they were able to
[57:30] speak and share the gospel to those that
[57:33] are around them that are from different
[57:34] countries and and know different
[57:36] languages it says in verse 5 and there
[57:38] were there dwelling at Jerusalem Jews
[57:41] devout men out of every nation under
[57:43] heaven and now when this was noised
[57:45] abroad the multitude came together and
[57:46] they were confounded because that every
[57:49] man heard them speak in his own language
[57:52] so these people are going around they've
[57:54] received the infil of the Holy Ghost and
[57:56] they're walking around and they're
[57:57] sharing what's going on with all these
[57:58] people and then everyone comes together
[58:00] and they say are you hearing what I'm
[58:01] hearing yes I'm hearing what you're
[58:03] hearing well how come you can hear it
[58:04] and I can hear it at the same time and
[58:05] they're only speaking once it's the holy
[58:08] ghost moving in the people what is it
[58:09] they were yielded to the holy spirit for
[58:12] the first time in their lives amen and
[58:14] this is Isaiah 28 being fulfilled to the
[58:16] letter stammering tongues and in another
[58:19] language amen and they don't actually
[58:21] know what they're doing they understand
[58:24] the effect but they don't know how it's
[58:25] happening inside of their lives they've
[58:27] never been taught how to do these things
[58:29] but under the anointing of the Holy
[58:30] Spirit they're literally preaching the
[58:32] gospel they're speaking the gospel
[58:34] they're sharing what's happening they're
[58:35] sharing that it's Isaiah 28 they're
[58:37] sharing that it's Joel 2 as Peter starts
[58:39] to tell them about and they're saying
[58:41] this is what he's talking about not the
[58:42] tongues the Holy Ghost how do we get the
[58:45] Holy Ghost we listen to what Christ said
[58:47] he said go up in a room and stay there
[58:48] until you're endued with power from on
[58:50] high this is it this is what it's all
[58:52] been talking about this is the rest that
[58:54] Isa spoke about it's not speaking in
[58:57] tongues that's not it it amazes me that
[59:00] Pentecost is so focused on speaking in
[59:02] tongues because it's very clear here
[59:04] that the speaking in tongues is not the
[59:05] rest it's the Holy Ghost that's the rest
[59:07] anden the rest for the believer is the
[59:09] holy spirit in us doing the works of God
[59:12] Amen the rest is when we're filled with
[59:14] the spirit and yielded to the spirit so
[59:16] that he can work through US amen it's
[59:18] the Dynamics making the mechanics work
[59:21] because remember you've been built up by
[59:23] the word precept upon precept precept
[59:25] upon precept line upon line line upon
[59:28] line here a little there a little it's
[59:29] like an engine that they build and they
[59:31] put into a car they build it up bit by
[59:33] bit piece by bit stage by stage and they
[59:35] put it in the car and everything's
[59:37] perfect but brother Braham says you've
[59:39] got to put gasoline in there to make it
[59:41] run they've been taught by Jesus for
[59:44] three and a half years they've been
[59:45] given the word they've been told what to
[59:47] do and then he says go and wait because
[59:49] if you try and use it of your own will
[59:51] you'll make a mistake and we see they
[59:53] did it up in the upper room room cuz
[59:55] they picked the wrong disciple Christ
[59:57] chose Paul later and they chose mitias I
[1:00:01] believe brother BR would say he said
[1:00:03] they were up there and they're said well
[1:00:04] surely we have it now and they said no
[1:00:06] we'll know when we have it because it
[1:00:08] matches what the word says it's going to
[1:00:09] look like amen we can't go by by
[1:00:12] emotions we can't go by feelings we have
[1:00:14] to go by what the the word says our our
[1:00:16] experience is supposed to be
[1:00:18] amen and we see here that they were at
[1:00:21] total rest even when their lives their
[1:00:23] health their welfare their reputation uh
[1:00:25] their livelihoods whatever it was
[1:00:27] whatever was put in Jeopardy it didn't
[1:00:29] matter we see Peter Peter was two-faced
[1:00:31] Peter was a coward before this and as
[1:00:34] soon as he gets the Holy Ghost he comes
[1:00:36] out and he starts preaching the gospel
[1:00:38] and he won't shut up no matter what they
[1:00:39] do Peter goes to jail he gets hauled in
[1:00:41] front of the priesthood he gets hauled
[1:00:43] in front of the magistrate he gets
[1:00:44] whipped he gets beaten he gets put in
[1:00:47] jail they're going to kill him Nothing
[1:00:49] Stops Peter why cuz he's at rest he's at
[1:00:53] rest he's received the rest of the holy
[1:00:55] spirit inside of his life he's lost his
[1:00:57] worries he's lost his fears Peter is no
[1:00:59] longer concerned about
[1:01:01] self-preservation he's completely lost
[1:01:03] all fear amen all he cared about was
[1:01:05] what was going on inside of him and all
[1:01:07] he was doing was being yielded to the
[1:01:09] holy spirit amen brother Brown would say
[1:01:12] this and why are people so tossed about
[1:01:13] he says the Christian faith is based
[1:01:16] solidly upon rest he says that's right a
[1:01:19] Christian is not tossed about a
[1:01:21] Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:01:22] place a Christian doesn't fuss fume and
[1:01:25] worry about things a Christian rests
[1:01:27] it's all over it's all finished for the
[1:01:30] believer at Calvary he says that's right
[1:01:33] oh sickness may come and disappointments
[1:01:35] but the Christian is at rest knowing
[1:01:37] this that God is able to keep that which
[1:01:40] he has promised arrest is not looking at
[1:01:44] circumstances it's looking at the god
[1:01:45] that's behind the circumstances that
[1:01:48] says my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:01:50] knowing that that no matter what the
[1:01:52] thing is and how it looks there's
[1:01:53] neither sickness sorrow death there's
[1:01:56] not starvation or anything that can
[1:01:58] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:01:59] in Jesus Christ we're at rest he said
[1:02:03] Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she
[1:02:05] wants to The Anchor Holds now Paul would
[1:02:08] take us over in Hebrews 4 and he starts
[1:02:11] to expand on this thought of rest
[1:02:13] because Jesus only gives a couple of
[1:02:15] verses about rest and then Paul comes
[1:02:17] the anointed messenger for the age and
[1:02:19] he starts to show us what this full rest
[1:02:22] really looks like and we have today
[1:02:23] people that are f focused on the Sabbath
[1:02:25] you'll see of course the Jews are but
[1:02:27] even like the seventh day Venice and
[1:02:28] they'll say well that's his rest that's
[1:02:30] the day of rest but Paul takes us there
[1:02:33] and he says no no no the rest for the
[1:02:35] believer the Sabbath for the believer is
[1:02:37] the Holy Ghost it's your position it's
[1:02:39] your placing in Christ amen and so Paul
[1:02:42] would say in Hebrews 4 he says let us
[1:02:44] therefore fear that doesn't mean fear
[1:02:47] like be worried it says be
[1:02:49] careful lest the promise being left us
[1:02:52] of entering into his rest any of you
[1:02:54] should seem to come short of it to fall
[1:02:56] short of it to be in want to be
[1:02:58] destitute of this rest in other words to
[1:03:00] not be at rest he says if it's available
[1:03:03] be careful that you
[1:03:04] don't you you never come into it he says
[1:03:07] For unto us was the Gospel preached as
[1:03:10] well is unto them but the word preached
[1:03:13] did not profit them why I was listening
[1:03:16] to brother bradam yesterday morning he
[1:03:18] was said you'll hear the same word as
[1:03:20] the one next to you and you'll get it
[1:03:21] and they
[1:03:22] won't the preaching of the word is not
[1:03:25] what makes the difference it's the
[1:03:26] hearing of the word that makes the
[1:03:27] difference you got to hear it you got to
[1:03:29] accept it you got to believe it he says
[1:03:31] it didn't profit them not being mixed
[1:03:34] with faith in them that heard so in
[1:03:36] other words if you don't believe what
[1:03:37] you hear it won't do you any good it's
[1:03:40] God's grace that gives us Faith to
[1:03:42] recognize it the first time whenever
[1:03:44] that first time is people can hear the
[1:03:46] word many times but when God finally
[1:03:48] quickens it to their heart it's his
[1:03:51] grace that gives them Faith to believe
[1:03:52] it and accept it and act on it amen if
[1:03:55] you believe the words I'm preaching
[1:03:57] it'll have an effect if you don't
[1:03:59] believe the words I'm preaching it won't
[1:04:01] have an effect it has nothing to do with
[1:04:04] me it has everything to do with if God
[1:04:06] quickens it to you now I'm going to read
[1:04:09] this
[1:04:11] quote it says there's a reason your
[1:04:13] pastor can't do nothing for you you've
[1:04:16] got to have faith in him and confidence
[1:04:19] in him as a man of God point one but
[1:04:23] watch what he says
[1:04:24] and know that all things work together
[1:04:27] for good to them that love God you got
[1:04:29] to have confidence in the god behind the
[1:04:31] man not just confidence in the man you
[1:04:33] got to trust that God's working no
[1:04:35] matter what because I'm going to fail
[1:04:37] you I'm going to disappoint you but
[1:04:40] God's the one that you're looking to not
[1:04:42] to me he says that's right but I know
[1:04:44] this you've got to have confidence in
[1:04:46] the man you're dealing with or won't you
[1:04:48] do you any good to do any dealing that's
[1:04:50] true you've got to believe your pastor
[1:04:52] now he's talking about brother Neville
[1:04:53] now he says he's a good god- saved man
[1:04:56] preaching the gospel stand behind him
[1:04:58] with everything you've got but he says
[1:05:00] if he isn't go somewhere where they do
[1:05:03] do
[1:05:04] it he says that's right now that clears
[1:05:07] it up for both sides now remember this
[1:05:09] if he preaches the gospel stay with him
[1:05:11] help him cuz he's a man sent from God
[1:05:14] ordained of God to feel your feed your
[1:05:16] soul I'm not saying this to prop myself
[1:05:18] up I'm saying if you don't have
[1:05:20] confidence that I'm supposed to be here
[1:05:22] I won't do you any good
[1:05:24] and that has nothing to do with me and
[1:05:26] nothing to do with you that's just the
[1:05:28] way it is listen you're here not
[1:05:30] someplace else and if God has led you
[1:05:33] here then God is God is obligated to
[1:05:35] feed you here but you can't say God led
[1:05:38] me here but God isn't feeding me here it
[1:05:40] doesn't work that way because the grace
[1:05:42] of God will always keep you wherever he
[1:05:43] takes you amen so if you're not being
[1:05:45] fed here don't go find another Ministry
[1:05:49] go to God and say Lord where will I get
[1:05:52] fed that's the key
[1:05:54] the key is is not just to up and leave
[1:05:56] the key is to say Lord where is my
[1:05:58] pastor Lord where is the ministry that's
[1:06:00] going to feed me that's all that's
[1:06:02] needed and then when you go then God go
[1:06:05] with you we've had many people leave
[1:06:06] here wonderful Believers and we Lov them
[1:06:09] while they were here and then they moved
[1:06:11] on not what is it God leads each one and
[1:06:15] he leads them to a place where they can
[1:06:16] feed if they're sincere in their seeking
[1:06:19] amen and they go and they Thrive and
[1:06:21] it's a wonderful thing I'm not meant for
[1:06:23] everyone I've been I've been in other
[1:06:25] ministers under other ministers or been
[1:06:27] in other churches and services and I I
[1:06:30] would sit there and say I don't think I
[1:06:31] could sit under this man all the time
[1:06:32] that's okay he wasn't meant for me but
[1:06:36] don't don't put down the people that sit
[1:06:37] under his ministry either CU if he's
[1:06:39] feeding them that's what matters that's
[1:06:41] all that matters in these things
[1:06:43] amen but coming back to what Paul said
[1:06:47] he says for we which have believed do
[1:06:49] enter into rest amen we've got to have
[1:06:52] faith in the word it says as he said as
[1:06:54] I have sworn in my wrath if they shall
[1:06:55] enter into my rest although the works
[1:06:58] were finished from the foundation of the
[1:07:00] world so catch this thought now he's
[1:07:01] saying it's already been decided who's
[1:07:03] going to get the rest who's going to
[1:07:05] come into a place of rest and who will
[1:07:07] accept it and who won't accept it amen
[1:07:09] and it's not based on natural family or
[1:07:11] Ministry or church or lineage or
[1:07:13] anything of this it's based on the
[1:07:15] foreordained predestinated thoughts of
[1:07:17] God
[1:07:18] Amen because what all that came out of
[1:07:21] Israel were not Israel all that came out
[1:07:23] of Israel were not Abraham's seed and we
[1:07:25] know that only two of the original group
[1:07:28] went into the promised
[1:07:30] land they all came out but only two went
[1:07:34] in and God said they're not all going in
[1:07:37] but notice now our rest is in the fact
[1:07:39] that it's a finished work from the
[1:07:41] foundation of the world Amen the rest is
[1:07:43] on the basis that he's already decided
[1:07:45] it he's already declared it he's already
[1:07:48] made a path for it as I said before like
[1:07:50] brother Hank Snow said the the the
[1:07:52] film's already done and we you just got
[1:07:54] to walk through it it's already there
[1:07:56] the pictures already been taken amen
[1:07:58] it's not on the basis of performance
[1:07:59] that I'm going to make it to Heaven I'll
[1:08:01] make it because I'm a part of his word
[1:08:04] and he already declared that I'm going
[1:08:05] to make it amen there it's not just you
[1:08:08] and I as individuals but the even the
[1:08:10] path that we're on is is the plan of God
[1:08:12] it's the works of God and he took all of
[1:08:14] his plans and he put them into this and
[1:08:17] he showed us what it's going to look
[1:08:18] like so we can have faith as we hit the
[1:08:21] way points that we in his will cuz it
[1:08:23] matches up with the experience that the
[1:08:24] word says we're going to have just like
[1:08:26] Joel 228 just like Isaiah 28 just like
[1:08:29] they had in Acts 2 we can go and we can
[1:08:30] say it's God because his word is meeting
[1:08:33] up injunctions of my life and I can see
[1:08:35] what he's doing amen we mess up we make
[1:08:38] mistakes we step back we get out of
[1:08:39] shape and it doesn't phase God one bit
[1:08:42] not one bit you know who it does it
[1:08:44] phases you and I cuz we think somehow
[1:08:48] we're going to hold God back and we
[1:08:50] can't it's a finished work that's our
[1:08:53] rest as that it's a finished work no
[1:08:55] matter what I do if I'm great if I'm
[1:08:58] good then that's great but if I'm not so
[1:09:01] great it's not going to change God's
[1:09:02] work it's already a finished work and
[1:09:04] that's the rest amen and we we we sit
[1:09:06] there and we we do something we ought
[1:09:08] not to we think something we react the
[1:09:10] way we don't and what do we do we think
[1:09:11] we're going to stop God and we pull back
[1:09:13] and we cringe away and we we don't go to
[1:09:16] him in prayer and we we think he's so
[1:09:18] mad at us or he's so disappointed in us
[1:09:20] he's sitting there saying son daughter
[1:09:22] what are you worried about I've already
[1:09:24] made you over there you're already there
[1:09:26] you're not going to stop it the only
[1:09:28] thing you're hurting is Yourself by
[1:09:30] pulling
[1:09:31] away you just have to come back and make
[1:09:33] it right that's it that's all there's
[1:09:36] nothing to lose here there is a place of
[1:09:40] rest and brother Bram in studying this
[1:09:41] and for the sake of time I didn't put
[1:09:43] all these quotes in but he said the rest
[1:09:45] is there is therefore no condemnation to
[1:09:47] them that are in Christ that you can do
[1:09:49] something and he we read the last
[1:09:51] service where he said there's an
[1:09:52] atonement there there's a price paid and
[1:09:55] you go back to the price paid and say
[1:09:57] I'm sorry and I'm claiming the price
[1:09:58] paid and you are put back to right where
[1:10:01] you were
[1:10:02] before you never moved in his eyes
[1:10:05] because he sees you through the blood
[1:10:06] you only moved in your eyes your
[1:10:08] repentance is as much a restoration of
[1:10:10] you to your position than anything in
[1:10:12] your own eyes cuz you never you never
[1:10:14] moved it never moved out of it in God's
[1:10:16] eyes cuz he's seeing you through the
[1:10:17] blood it's a finished work amen God's
[1:10:20] already decided we're going to make it
[1:10:21] over there it's already done so it not
[1:10:23] to face us because it doesn't face him
[1:10:26] brother says this he says God himself
[1:10:28] came down in the form of a lamb don't
[1:10:30] look at yourself God don't look at you
[1:10:32] he looks at the lamb he looks at Christ
[1:10:34] and there was no fault in him and God
[1:10:37] accepted the offering you put your hand
[1:10:39] upon the lamb Christ Jesus confess your
[1:10:41] sins as being a sinner and the lamb has
[1:10:43] died for you the spirit that comes out
[1:10:46] of the Lamb comes back to the believer
[1:10:48] amen he says and you stand perfected
[1:10:51] because the one who died the innocent
[1:10:54] one the powerful one the overcoming one
[1:10:58] the accepted one in his own person
[1:11:00] returned in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:03] and brings the believer into rest he
[1:11:05] says there it is it's not you him God
[1:11:08] don't even see you he sees him you don't
[1:11:11] have to die he died in your place he was
[1:11:13] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:11:15] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:11:17] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:11:19] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:11:21] there's the foundation we're coming into
[1:11:24] the idea of rest and he says don't look
[1:11:26] to yourself he's the innocent one he's
[1:11:29] the powerful one he's the overcoming one
[1:11:31] he's the accepted one that's your rest
[1:11:34] in is that he's what everything God
[1:11:36] required and when he's in you then
[1:11:38] you're everything that God expects
[1:11:40] that's your rest amen the Lamb of God
[1:11:43] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:11:44] world the Book of Revelation says and
[1:11:46] therefore the price was paid and so your
[1:11:48] righteousness your peace your joy Your
[1:11:50] Grace your mercy whatever we have need
[1:11:52] of is guaranteed and provided under the
[1:11:55] atonement that was finished before you
[1:11:57] ever came into existence that's our rest
[1:12:00] amen it's part and parcel with the
[1:12:02] finished work of Calvary Paul continues
[1:12:04] he says for he spake in a certain place
[1:12:06] of the seventh day on this wise and God
[1:12:09] did rest the seventh day from all his
[1:12:11] works and in this place again he says if
[1:12:14] they shall enter into my
[1:12:20] rest seeing therefore it remaineth that
[1:12:23] some must enter there
[1:12:24] in I'm glad that he said there some are
[1:12:27] going to enter in he said some aren't
[1:12:29] going to take it most are going to
[1:12:30] refuse it but some are going to take it
[1:12:32] he says and they to whom it was first
[1:12:34] preached enter not in because of
[1:12:36] unbelief now he's pointing to the type
[1:12:38] and Shadow of Israel coming up to the
[1:12:40] Canaan land they left Egypt they went
[1:12:43] through justification they walked around
[1:12:44] the desert sanctification then they come
[1:12:47] up to the to the promised land and they
[1:12:49] refus to go into the land of promise why
[1:12:52] because they disbelieve what what God
[1:12:53] said because they were looking at
[1:12:55] themselves relative to the
[1:12:57] competition they disbelieved because
[1:12:59] they were so looking at themselves that
[1:13:01] they couldn't see the promise of God
[1:13:03] even though everything over there was
[1:13:05] exactly as God described they ignored
[1:13:07] the blessings and looked at what who was
[1:13:10] going to try and hold them back and they
[1:13:12] said we can't do it and they disbelieved
[1:13:15] the promises of God Amen and because
[1:13:17] they're looking at themselves they limit
[1:13:19] the effect of God in their lives and
[1:13:20] they never got anywhere with it and they
[1:13:22] died in the wilderness they died in
[1:13:23] their sins amen then in verse 7 he says
[1:13:26] again he limited limith a certain day
[1:13:28] saying in in David today after so long a
[1:13:31] time as it is said today if you will
[1:13:33] hear his voice Harden not your hearts
[1:13:36] the scripture says God won't always
[1:13:38] strive with men but while he's striving
[1:13:41] there's Mercy there's Grace there's
[1:13:42] opportunity in these things amen God
[1:13:44] terries and waits far longer than we
[1:13:46] ever
[1:13:47] would his mercies are new Every Morning
[1:13:49] amen he his desires that All Flesh would
[1:13:52] be saved
[1:13:53] God wants to preserve life but there
[1:13:56] comes a day where he turns it down and
[1:13:58] you don't want to be here when he says
[1:14:00] the door is closed cuz after that all
[1:14:02] that's left is judgment and that's
[1:14:04] tribulation and you know what
[1:14:05] tribulation looks like tribulation is a
[1:14:07] time when everybody wants to die and
[1:14:09] they can't that's how bad it's going to
[1:14:10] be we don't want to be over there it
[1:14:14] says for if Jesus had given them rest
[1:14:16] then would he not afterward have spoken
[1:14:18] of another day so in other words he's
[1:14:20] saying if if Christ had given them rest
[1:14:21] through their Sabbath why would even
[1:14:23] spoken of another
[1:14:25] rest amen it was just a shadow of what
[1:14:27] was coming in verse 9 he says there
[1:14:30] therefore remain there remaineth
[1:14:32] therefore a rest to the people of God so
[1:14:34] in other words there's a different rest
[1:14:36] than the Sabbath there's a different
[1:14:38] rest than the law there's a different
[1:14:40] rest than I've done everything the law
[1:14:41] told me to do cuz in the end they didn't
[1:14:44] Jesus came and he says you can you can
[1:14:46] say you didn't do it but if you even
[1:14:48] think about doing it it's the same as if
[1:14:49] you did it and then all of a sudden
[1:14:51] we're like well in their Hearts they
[1:14:53] knew then that they were
[1:14:55] condemned even if they' never acted on
[1:14:57] lusting after a woman he says you
[1:14:59] thought after her and it's the same as
[1:15:01] you thought about doing it and so it's
[1:15:02] the same as doing it your your thoughts
[1:15:05] are not Sanctified so you're in sin
[1:15:07] before God and therefore you have to die
[1:15:09] outside of a shed
[1:15:11] blood but brother R would say this he
[1:15:14] says here is the rest in the message it
[1:15:16] says he picks up the Bible it says this
[1:15:19] is the rest that you can cause the weary
[1:15:21] to rest he says this is it amen it'll be
[1:15:24] precept upon precept and line upon line
[1:15:26] in other words you don't just get this
[1:15:28] rest but God builds you up to this Rest
[1:15:30] by what letting you see what's available
[1:15:33] in his word he lets you read his word he
[1:15:35] lets you believe his word he lets you
[1:15:37] have faith in his word he lets you act
[1:15:38] on his word and then what he comes is he
[1:15:41] vindicates his word in you amen the word
[1:15:43] of God brings you to the promises of the
[1:15:45] word which is Christ in you that that's
[1:15:48] the whole goal of all this is to get
[1:15:50] Christ in you and then Jesus stood in
[1:15:52] front of them and they turned down the
[1:15:53] word in flesh and then today brother
[1:15:55] Braham says the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:15:57] they turn it down because they don't
[1:15:58] want it in their flesh but it's got to
[1:16:00] be the same thing he said here is the
[1:16:03] rest what is the Holy Ghost the rest
[1:16:07] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[1:16:09] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:16:11] what is he he is the one that comes in
[1:16:14] you and gives you peace he's your sign
[1:16:17] you're comforter you're comforted you're
[1:16:19] at rest you're sealed he says it's a
[1:16:21] sign the world knows something has
[1:16:23] happened to you what is it it's a
[1:16:25] comforter what is it a seal you're at
[1:16:26] rest it's your Advocate if something
[1:16:29] happens to you there's something there
[1:16:30] to make an advocate for you right quick
[1:16:32] see it's making intercessions it's the
[1:16:35] spirit of the Living God in the church
[1:16:38] prophesied exactly what it would be when
[1:16:40] it come he says it will be an
[1:16:43] everlasting Eternal rest so this is not
[1:16:46] a temporary thing this is not just a a
[1:16:48] have it now and gone tomorrow type thing
[1:16:50] amen but this is the original rest amen
[1:16:53] it's life in Christ that's what he's
[1:16:56] talking about he says it's the Holy
[1:16:57] Ghost that's why Jesus said come unto me
[1:16:59] and learn of me because it's precept
[1:17:02] upon precept you got to come to Christ
[1:17:05] you got to sit under the word and the
[1:17:06] word leads you to Christ himself in
[1:17:09] other words it leads you to the Life of
[1:17:10] Christ himself and he's talking about
[1:17:13] and what he's making here is a reference
[1:17:14] to how they teach a young Ox to pull a
[1:17:16] load and they partner it up with a
[1:17:18] mature one a well-trained one a powerful
[1:17:21] one that knows how to pull a load and so
[1:17:23] a young Ox can pull I I preached on this
[1:17:25] at brother John Andes a little over a
[1:17:27] year ago and a young Ox can pull 2,000
[1:17:30] lb
[1:17:31] roughly a mature Ox can pull 5,000 cuz
[1:17:35] he knows how to do it but you take that
[1:17:37] mature one and you put him with a young
[1:17:39] one and let them work together and he'll
[1:17:41] bring that young one up to a 5,000lb
[1:17:44] limit he'll give him two and a half
[1:17:45] times more pulling power than he had
[1:17:47] before just by teaching them how to move
[1:17:50] just by teaching them how to walk how to
[1:17:52] place his feet how to set his shoulders
[1:17:54] into the Yoke the younger learns from
[1:17:57] the older and that learning makes them
[1:17:59] more
[1:18:00] effective because what they're leaning
[1:18:03] they're yielding to what that other one
[1:18:05] has to say work harder not work smarter
[1:18:09] not harder is what this is about you can
[1:18:12] sit there and you can pull all day but
[1:18:13] if you don't know how to pull you're not
[1:18:15] going to move it in the old in the old
[1:18:18] days back in up in Alaska and whatnot
[1:18:20] they used dogs to to pull sledges and
[1:18:23] they taught the dogs how to break them
[1:18:24] out cuz when the sledges the sleds were
[1:18:26] were on the ice and they'd leave them
[1:18:28] overnight and they'd freeze and so they
[1:18:30] teach the dogs to yank right and then
[1:18:32] they'd yank left and yank right and yank
[1:18:33] left and it would break the runners free
[1:18:35] so that the slides could go but if they
[1:18:38] never taught the dogs how to do that
[1:18:40] those dogs could pull a load that they
[1:18:41] could otherwise pull and they'd never
[1:18:43] get it moving they had to teach him how
[1:18:44] to get it moving once they got it moving
[1:18:46] it went a lot easier but they had to
[1:18:48] teach him how to break those things out
[1:18:49] and this is what's Happening Here amen
[1:18:51] is he says you got to get yolked up and
[1:18:53] you know what a yoke does it takes away
[1:18:55] your
[1:18:56] Independence see now you're tied in with
[1:18:59] something you can't move independently
[1:19:01] Christ is saying you can't do this on
[1:19:03] your own the road you're walking the
[1:19:06] load you're pulling the battle you're
[1:19:07] fighting you can't do this on your own
[1:19:09] you got to come to a place where you say
[1:19:11] I can't do it because he says you've got
[1:19:14] to come to me and yield to my yoke I'm
[1:19:16] not just going to slap it on you I'm not
[1:19:18] going to lassu you and pull you up and
[1:19:20] force you into it but he says you got to
[1:19:22] come to me and say I'm willing to try
[1:19:23] your way cuz I've been doing my way and
[1:19:25] it's not working so I'm going to go your
[1:19:28] way now cuz youve said your load's light
[1:19:30] mine's too heavy for me to pull but if
[1:19:32] I'm with you you said it's going to be
[1:19:34] light if I can do it amen what do we do
[1:19:36] we've got to be able to lay down
[1:19:38] everything we've got and say Lord you
[1:19:40] teach me cuz my pulling ain't working so
[1:19:44] I've got to step into your yoke amen
[1:19:45] we've got to learn we've got to listen
[1:19:47] we've got to grow wisdom Revelation amen
[1:19:50] come to a place where we say Lord I've
[1:19:51] tried so hard on my own
[1:19:53] and I have nothing to show for it now
[1:19:56] I'm willing to try your way that's the
[1:19:58] place where God wants us to be amen you
[1:20:00] know what happens we get sick and tired
[1:20:01] of being sick and tired anybody ever
[1:20:04] feel that way where you're going you're
[1:20:06] going you're going You're trying you
[1:20:08] know whether it's our our businessmen
[1:20:10] and they're putting in quotes and
[1:20:11] proposals and quotes and proposals and
[1:20:14] nothing's coming in and we're burning
[1:20:17] ourselves out trying to get business
[1:20:20] rather than saying Lord you provide
[1:20:23] I'm going to settle
[1:20:25] down I'm going to settle down and trust
[1:20:27] you you give me leadership of where to
[1:20:29] put my time where to put my effort and
[1:20:31] I'll trust you to bring the bacon home
[1:20:33] every day we're trying for a promotion
[1:20:35] at work whether it could be anything it
[1:20:37] can be for our health it can be for
[1:20:39] weight it can be whatever we're going
[1:20:40] through and say Lord I need you because
[1:20:42] I've tried and I've tried and I've tried
[1:20:44] and nothing's working nothing sticks
[1:20:46] nothing
[1:20:47] holds amen there's a place of rest
[1:20:49] there's a place of refreshing amen when
[1:20:52] we get sick and tired of being sick and
[1:20:53] tired that's a great place to let go and
[1:20:54] let God have his way amen rest comes
[1:20:58] when we lay it down you know if you ever
[1:21:00] tried to lay down with a backpack
[1:21:02] on doesn't work you just go to one side
[1:21:06] or the other and it's pulling on you
[1:21:07] this way or that but if you can take the
[1:21:09] load off and lay it aside now you can
[1:21:12] have rest you can sit down you can lay
[1:21:14] down and everything's nice and comfy but
[1:21:16] we've got to lay it down and it comes
[1:21:18] with laying down our ambition it comes
[1:21:19] down with laying down our wisdom our
[1:21:20] education our knowledge our need for
[1:21:22] control whatever it might be our way of
[1:21:24] doing things and saying Lord I'm going
[1:21:26] to let you do it remember we spoke last
[1:21:28] service where Paul said forgetting those
[1:21:30] things that are behind letting them go
[1:21:33] he says that's how we progress and we
[1:21:34] get towards the prize of the high
[1:21:35] calling in Christ
[1:21:37] Jesus Paul continues he says for he that
[1:21:40] has entered into his rest he also ha
[1:21:43] ceased from his own
[1:21:45] works as God did from his amen his own
[1:21:48] works and I want to spend some time on
[1:21:49] this for the last half of this service
[1:21:51] because this is the key to this whole
[1:21:53] thing about rest amen is about what is
[1:21:56] ceasing from your own Works amen we've
[1:21:58] got to stop we've got to let go of how
[1:22:00] we want things done we got to let go of
[1:22:03] what we want to come out of it even
[1:22:05] sometimes we're so insistent on how it
[1:22:07] comes out and God's saying but that's
[1:22:09] not the way I've ordained
[1:22:10] it we want everybody in we want everyone
[1:22:14] a certain way I said last service we're
[1:22:15] not carbon copies our walk is not the
[1:22:18] the the Walk of the person next to us
[1:22:19] the way we get there is not always the
[1:22:21] same but it's up to God to do of his
[1:22:23] good pleasure amen it's up to God to do
[1:22:25] his good will it's for us to pull back
[1:22:27] and say Lord I'm just going to let you
[1:22:28] lead me amen we'll start with another
[1:22:31] scripture in Hebrews
[1:22:33] 61 Paul says therefore leaving the
[1:22:36] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[1:22:38] us go on unto Perfection that's charity
[1:22:41] that's the Holy Ghost he says not laying
[1:22:42] again the foundation of repentance from
[1:22:44] dead works and of Faith toward God now
[1:22:47] we think dead works is what we did
[1:22:49] before everything before we became a
[1:22:51] professing Christian brother says that's
[1:22:53] not it at all listen to this quote he
[1:22:55] says we believe that there's a baptism
[1:22:57] we believe in the resurrection of the
[1:22:59] Dead absolutely we believe Jesus died
[1:23:00] and rose again we believe that laying on
[1:23:02] the hands for the sick that's what it
[1:23:04] said these signs shall follow them that
[1:23:06] believe if they lay hands on the sick
[1:23:07] they shall recover he says we believe
[1:23:09] that but what is that Paul said it's all
[1:23:12] dead works why because it's something
[1:23:15] that you
[1:23:16] do dead works is something you do he
[1:23:20] says now let's go on to Perfection he
[1:23:21] says oh my work coming into the
[1:23:23] Tabernacle now not the foundation the
[1:23:25] Tabernacle itself that's the foundation
[1:23:28] the law and righteousness and joining
[1:23:30] church and being baptized and lay on of
[1:23:32] hands those are all orders of the church
[1:23:34] but he says but now let us go into
[1:23:36] Perfection and there's only one that's
[1:23:38] perfected that's
[1:23:39] Jesus I've said this before Judas did
[1:23:42] everything brother brandham just talked
[1:23:44] about he laid hands on the sick and they
[1:23:46] recovered he cast out demons he went to
[1:23:48] church he was associated with Christ he
[1:23:50] was baptized he he did all of those
[1:23:53] things amen but he said there's only one
[1:23:55] one way to get into Perfection and
[1:23:57] that's to come into Christ and that's
[1:23:59] when the word is made flesh inside of
[1:24:01] you by the Holy Spirit and Judas stopped
[1:24:03] short of that why because he tried to
[1:24:05] control the
[1:24:06] situation amen there'll many be many
[1:24:09] that hear this message sit in a message
[1:24:11] church and never go in a Rapture why
[1:24:14] because they love the letter but they
[1:24:15] don't love the spirit because the spirit
[1:24:17] would force them to lay down something
[1:24:18] that they don't want to lay down they
[1:24:20] want control and so they refuse to
[1:24:23] yield they want results and so they
[1:24:25] refuse to take their hands off the
[1:24:27] wheel right they want a reputation and
[1:24:29] so they refuse to Humble themselves and
[1:24:32] God can't do that God can't work with
[1:24:34] that and what is it they're literally
[1:24:35] shutting out the spirit because they
[1:24:37] love the letter there's a lot to love
[1:24:39] about the letter of this message it's a
[1:24:40] tremendous message intellectually it's
[1:24:43] tremendous the when the word is opened
[1:24:46] and the understanding is there it's an
[1:24:48] amazing thing to see the word as it was
[1:24:50] meant to be seen but it still kills if
[1:24:52] you don't have the spirit to make it
[1:24:53] live inside of you amen it's all dead
[1:24:56] works and people will do things in in in
[1:24:58] his name and all these things but it's
[1:25:00] dead Works unless he knows you unless he
[1:25:01] has an intimate relationship with you
[1:25:04] Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 12 he
[1:25:06] says for as the body is one and had many
[1:25:08] members and all that members of that one
[1:25:10] body being many are one body so also is
[1:25:13] Christ so he says Christ is the body of
[1:25:15] Christ that that mystical Body of Christ
[1:25:18] as brother Brown would call it's all
[1:25:19] different parts but it's all one unified
[1:25:21] body you look at your hand I've got
[1:25:23] fingers but even my fingers aren't the
[1:25:26] same I've got five fingers here there of
[1:25:28] different lengths different strengths
[1:25:29] different purposes then I go over here
[1:25:31] and they're the same but they're not the
[1:25:32] same because they're in another place
[1:25:34] then we've got all of our organs we've
[1:25:35] got our skin we've got our muscles and
[1:25:37] they're all different he says they're
[1:25:38] all different don't try and be the same
[1:25:41] but you still have to be unified you
[1:25:43] still have to be able to work together
[1:25:44] and sometimes our differences are the
[1:25:46] things that are separating us rather
[1:25:47] than drawing us together like I said in
[1:25:49] the in the last service or two it's our
[1:25:51] it's our strengths that ought to bring
[1:25:53] us together not our weaknesses that hold
[1:25:54] us apart Amen Brother Paul's got things
[1:25:57] I don't have but I've got things that
[1:26:00] brother Paul doesn't
[1:26:01] have but that doesn't mean he puts me
[1:26:03] out or I put him out because of what we
[1:26:04] don't have but we can Fellowship
[1:26:06] together because he strengthens me where
[1:26:08] I'm weak and I strengthen him where he's
[1:26:09] weak because we're part of this big body
[1:26:11] and together we can do more amen so
[1:26:13] that's what's happening now is the
[1:26:15] unifying of the Saints under a five-fold
[1:26:17] Ministry it's the perfecting of the
[1:26:18] Saints until we come into the unity of
[1:26:20] the faith which is the rapture that's
[1:26:21] the one thing we're all looking for amen
[1:26:24] but he says for by one Spirit are we all
[1:26:26] baptized into one body we're speaking on
[1:26:28] you shall find rest now he says for by
[1:26:30] one Spirit are all baptized into one
[1:26:32] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[1:26:34] whether we be Bond or free and have been
[1:26:36] all made to drink into one Spirit
[1:26:39] brother says by the Holy Spirit baptism
[1:26:41] we're baptized into that body and are
[1:26:44] free from sin that means I don't bring
[1:26:47] it up about you and you don't bring it
[1:26:48] up about me either Braham says if you
[1:26:51] bring it out from under the blood you're
[1:26:52] responsible for
[1:26:54] it he says God don't see you no more he
[1:26:57] only sees Christ and when you're in that
[1:26:59] body God can't judge that body he's
[1:27:01] already judged it he took our judgments
[1:27:03] and invited us in and by faith through
[1:27:06] Grace we walk and accept our pardoning
[1:27:08] and the Holy Spirit brings us into this
[1:27:10] fellowship with him he says and we walk
[1:27:12] no more after the things of the world
[1:27:14] but we walk in the spirit quickened the
[1:27:17] word came to us he died in my stead and
[1:27:20] I made alive here I am who was once dead
[1:27:22] in sin and trespasses be made alive now
[1:27:25] watch the effect this is rest he says
[1:27:27] all my desires is to serve him all my
[1:27:31] love is to him all my walks want to be
[1:27:33] in his name that wherever I go where
[1:27:37] whatever I do I glorify him now listen
[1:27:41] to what he says here he doesn't say if
[1:27:44] I'm
[1:27:45] preaching if I'm baptizing if I'm
[1:27:48] fellowshipping he says if I'm hunting if
[1:27:51] I'm fishing if I'm playing ball whatever
[1:27:54] I'm doing I must be Christ in me in such
[1:27:57] a life that will make men long to be
[1:28:00] that way not tattling backbiting and
[1:28:03] fing fussing about your churches you get
[1:28:06] it in the fun times as well as the
[1:28:09] serious times it's still got to be
[1:28:10] Christ in me wherever I go it ought to
[1:28:12] make people salty I ought to be salty to
[1:28:15] make people thirsty for what's inside of
[1:28:17] me brother BR would continue in another
[1:28:19] message he says that's how by one Spirit
[1:28:21] we're all baptized into one body and are
[1:28:24] at rest he says oh what can the world do
[1:28:27] that's where we lose our rest so often
[1:28:29] as we look at what the world can do well
[1:28:32] I can lose my job I can lose my health I
[1:28:34] can lose my finances I can lose my
[1:28:36] reputation people are going to make fun
[1:28:37] of me people won't accept
[1:28:40] me take my home it's getting to the
[1:28:43] point where they're going to be able to
[1:28:44] take our
[1:28:46] children that's what they did in the
[1:28:47] first acts didn't they pull people out
[1:28:50] separated them killed them
[1:28:53] said but for you know for your sake
[1:28:54] we're killed all the day
[1:28:56] long but he says what can the world do
[1:28:58] when you're at rest in Christ what can
[1:29:00] the world
[1:29:01] do if I go today it'll be the happiest
[1:29:04] day of my
[1:29:06] life but we say well brother John you're
[1:29:08] going to be suffering you're going to be
[1:29:09] this what can the world do if I'm at
[1:29:12] rest in Christ if I know I'm sealed to
[1:29:14] the day of my
[1:29:16] Redemption he said I'm so glad God got a
[1:29:19] hold of me before the church did with
[1:29:20] all of its Doctrine I found a resting
[1:29:22] place all that sweet Abiding Place where
[1:29:25] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:29:27] to them that are in Christ Jesus that's
[1:29:29] found Eternal
[1:29:32] rest you can't rest when you're
[1:29:36] working amen and Paul's trying to get us
[1:29:38] to see that you'll stop from from doing
[1:29:41] those dead works when you recognize that
[1:29:44] what you can achieve has no Eternal
[1:29:47] value what you can achieve on your
[1:29:49] own is nothing for God you can't do it
[1:29:53] you can't do it that scripture I
[1:29:55] referred to so many times they'll say to
[1:29:57] him in the end and they say did not we
[1:29:59] do this and that and I I'll do many
[1:30:00] wonderful works in your name he says no
[1:30:03] get away from me I never knew you it
[1:30:05] didn't add up to a hill of beans in the
[1:30:07] end it's not that it didn't do anything
[1:30:09] it's that it had no Eternal purpose in
[1:30:11] the kingdom of God anden the greatest
[1:30:13] limitation in my life is
[1:30:15] me I don't care how smart I am I don't
[1:30:18] care how disciplined I am I don't care
[1:30:20] how hard I work how hard I study the
[1:30:21] greatest limitation I have is me because
[1:30:24] compared to God I'm
[1:30:25] nothing I if this was a scale of me to
[1:30:28] God I'm not even on the surface I'm
[1:30:30] embedded in the surface I'm nothing
[1:30:32] compared to him that's the greatest
[1:30:34] thing as a Believer we have to recognize
[1:30:36] is that compared to him we bring nothing
[1:30:38] to the table that's why we've got to die
[1:30:41] so that Christ can live in me amen when
[1:30:44] you come into him the works are not just
[1:30:46] greater but they're lasting and they
[1:30:49] have real purpose they have real benefit
[1:30:52] brother says anybody can be wrong he
[1:30:55] says you don't know he says I Die daily
[1:30:57] from my wrongs and try to live before
[1:30:59] Christ that's all we can
[1:31:01] do Die daily and try and live before him
[1:31:05] he says and anybody that's big enough
[1:31:06] and got enough spirit of God to walk up
[1:31:08] and admit their wrong and say I want the
[1:31:10] right thing he said I've got a lot of
[1:31:12] confidence right there for that's truly
[1:31:14] Abraham's seed they want to know
[1:31:19] it you'll cease from your dead works
[1:31:21] when you realize that this is a work of
[1:31:24] his choosing not yours see what happens
[1:31:27] is we think we're making the choices
[1:31:29] we're making the decisions we're making
[1:31:31] things happen you know what was so
[1:31:33] wonderful about sister Leah's healing
[1:31:34] the other day had nothing to do with
[1:31:37] me nothing to do with me I didn't pray
[1:31:41] for her I didn't lay hands on her and I
[1:31:43] had no clue what was happening sister
[1:31:45] Leah why because he does all things
[1:31:49] well and the thing is you know what
[1:31:52] sister Leah learned that day that she
[1:31:54] doesn't have to come to Brother John for
[1:31:57] prayer he touched her I didn't touch you
[1:32:01] I didn't do a thing you know what she
[1:32:03] said she said I'm going to church no
[1:32:04] matter what and God recognized her faith
[1:32:08] and healed her supernaturally right
[1:32:09] there in her seat he did
[1:32:11] it that's a Vindication of your faith
[1:32:14] sister Leah and has nothing to do with
[1:32:16] me nothing to do with me I couldn't have
[1:32:19] made that happen if I wanted to couldn't
[1:32:21] have made it happen if I wanted to but
[1:32:23] God comes down and he touches her right
[1:32:25] there where she's sitting why because
[1:32:27] faith comes by hearing amen that's all
[1:32:31] it is it's so simple it's so simple and
[1:32:34] then the sovereignty of God moves in and
[1:32:36] something happens that is completely
[1:32:37] Supernatural and she can walk out a free
[1:32:39] woman completely healed amen what a
[1:32:42] wonderful thing it is when we realize
[1:32:43] this is his doing not mine I didn't
[1:32:46] choose him he chose me I didn't reach
[1:32:48] out to him he reached out to me he
[1:32:51] called me he ordained me he
[1:32:54] predestinated me this is all him amen it
[1:32:57] it reminded me as I was I was studying
[1:32:59] this you know we have these the these
[1:33:01] little parks for our kids and you ever
[1:33:02] see they've got the the cars there and
[1:33:05] they have a steering
[1:33:07] wheel and it's a steering wheel that you
[1:33:09] can spin forever and the kids go in
[1:33:11] there and they turn it or they'll spin
[1:33:12] it they'll spin it they'll spin it but
[1:33:14] what happens to the front wheels nothing
[1:33:16] cuz it's not
[1:33:17] connected sometimes we're like little
[1:33:19] children we're in there and and we're
[1:33:21] playing with our lives and we're making
[1:33:22] this and we're doing that and making
[1:33:23] decisions and I'm going to affect this
[1:33:25] and I'm going to affect that and all it
[1:33:26] is is we're at the park and God's
[1:33:28] sitting there laughing at us because the
[1:33:30] wheel doesn't work that we've got in our
[1:33:32] hands cuz why we're already ordained to
[1:33:35] make
[1:33:36] it and all we do is change our
[1:33:38] circumstance a little bit we change our
[1:33:39] attitude a little bit but it doesn't
[1:33:42] change the big picture the car ain't
[1:33:43] going anywhere cuz God's in control it's
[1:33:46] brother Mark's fond say run a boat to
[1:33:48] China and you can do all you want but
[1:33:50] the boat's going to go to China no
[1:33:52] matter what you say no matter what you
[1:33:53] do whether you like it whether you don't
[1:33:55] whether you appreciate it whether you
[1:33:56] don't it doesn't change a thing the
[1:33:57] boat's going to China and you're going
[1:33:58] to make it cuz you're on that boat amen
[1:34:02] God's got the whole thing already
[1:34:03] ordained it's already figured out it's
[1:34:05] already planned in all our little turns
[1:34:07] and stops and indecisions and failures
[1:34:08] and faults they don't have a a single
[1:34:11] thing to do with whether we're going to
[1:34:12] make it or
[1:34:13] not brother Bram says this he says
[1:34:15] that's the way it is in any life it
[1:34:18] takes God it isn't what you do it's what
[1:34:21] God does see you say I sought God I
[1:34:23] sought God you're mistaken no man seeks
[1:34:26] God God seeks the man see it's not you
[1:34:28] seeking God it's God seeking you Jesus
[1:34:30] said you haven't chosen me but I chose
[1:34:32] you see you were chosen before the
[1:34:34] foundation of the world or you weren't
[1:34:36] chosen at all he just came to redeem
[1:34:38] that name and all whose names are on
[1:34:40] that Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:34:42] foundation of the world are the only
[1:34:44] ones going to be there anyhow see he
[1:34:47] says you were chosen in him before the
[1:34:49] foundation of the world we're talking
[1:34:50] you shall find rest this is the Keystone
[1:34:53] Revelation for the believer is that
[1:34:55] you're all there as far as God's
[1:34:58] concerned it's a finished work and youve
[1:35:00] got to come into the same place he said
[1:35:02] when the lamb was chosen when you were
[1:35:04] chosen with him before the foundation he
[1:35:06] says and you are as I said last night an
[1:35:09] attribute of God's thinking see that's
[1:35:11] the only way you can be Eternal and the
[1:35:13] only form of eternal life there's only
[1:35:15] one form of eternal life and that's God
[1:35:17] so that's all he's the one that's
[1:35:19] Eternal he says now we find out that the
[1:35:22] seal means that it is a finished work
[1:35:24] with God it's already settled and every
[1:35:26] believer was sealed with this promise
[1:35:28] from the very beginning because before
[1:35:30] the foundation of the world we were
[1:35:32] predestinated unto the adoption of sons
[1:35:35] before the world ever began he says oh
[1:35:37] what a hope that makes us steadfast and
[1:35:41] sure church when things aren't going
[1:35:43] right when it things seems like things
[1:35:45] are going all wrong when it seems like
[1:35:46] you can't get anywhere you need to come
[1:35:48] back to this thought that he said I'm
[1:35:50] going to make it he wrote my name in
[1:35:53] that book and he's calling the names out
[1:35:55] and this is the time for the Redemption
[1:35:57] and the adoption of Sons and Daughters
[1:35:58] of
[1:35:59] God that's the reminder we need to have
[1:36:01] that's the rest that's the refreshing is
[1:36:04] that he said I'm going to make it and
[1:36:06] he's going to make my life produce it
[1:36:09] he'll bring us subject to what the word
[1:36:10] has already said about us he said an
[1:36:13] anchor to the soul that's not tossed
[1:36:14] about here and there but it's Anchored
[1:36:16] In Christ to hope that sure he said he's
[1:36:19] predestinated us before the foundation
[1:36:21] of of the world to the adoption of sons
[1:36:23] by Jesus Christ he says oh how wonderful
[1:36:25] I love that it's a finished work with
[1:36:28] God God's not worried and if we're in
[1:36:31] Christ then why are we
[1:36:33] worried if he's satisfied it's done then
[1:36:36] why are we unsatisfied why are we out of
[1:36:38] rest why are we unwell why are we
[1:36:40] worried it's a finished work that's the
[1:36:43] rest is it's a finished work so
[1:36:46] understanding that what is our labor cuz
[1:36:47] Paul said you got a labor to get into
[1:36:49] this rest what is is our labor what is
[1:36:52] our work what is our striving to do let
[1:36:54] go of the wheel let go of the wheel and
[1:36:56] trust God Amen get into Christ by the
[1:36:58] baptism of the Holy Spirit and let him
[1:37:01] take control and Trust his leading trust
[1:37:03] his provision TR trust his guidance
[1:37:05] trust his
[1:37:07] goodness trust his Fellowship trust his
[1:37:13] feeding Paul said in Hebrews 4 let us
[1:37:15] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[1:37:18] lest any man fall after the same example
[1:37:20] of unbelief and many he's talking about
[1:37:22] in Israel you come so far and then you
[1:37:24] stop because you won't let
[1:37:26] go you know when in our in our life
[1:37:29] today Labor what why do we labor food on
[1:37:33] the table roof over our head vehicle in
[1:37:35] the driveway closeth on our
[1:37:38] back and then we labor all the more to
[1:37:40] pay off the mortgage to maybe get a
[1:37:42] vacation now and again to be able to
[1:37:45] retire hopefully before we're 65 or 70
[1:37:48] and have some comfort and ease of Life
[1:37:50] as we close things out
[1:37:52] I was reading on CBC there that they
[1:37:54] said people are laboring now just to
[1:37:56] survive they're working two and three
[1:37:58] jobs 18 hours a day six and seven days a
[1:38:01] week just to pay their
[1:38:03] bills and some of them are barely making
[1:38:05] it one man said I go I cry myself to
[1:38:08] sleep at
[1:38:09] night cuz he's striving to make
[1:38:13] it that's not our labor Church remember
[1:38:16] what we said he said seek ye first the
[1:38:18] kingdom of God and all these things will
[1:38:20] be add to he says you're father knows
[1:38:22] what you have need of he says he knows
[1:38:24] you know you need all of these things
[1:38:26] everything you have need of he knows you
[1:38:28] need it but he says seek Him First and
[1:38:30] everything else will be taken care of
[1:38:32] listen I I've shared the story how Blanc
[1:38:34] and I came to church and we were $10 in
[1:38:36] the negative I think or a dollar in the
[1:38:38] negative on our bank account and we had
[1:38:41] a an an insurance bill coming out the
[1:38:43] next morning that was going to be
[1:38:46] $100 and we had no money and there was
[1:38:48] no way of making it and of course then
[1:38:50] you get ding and you go into overdraft
[1:38:52] and then they charge you $35 for that we
[1:38:54] were poor students had no money nothing
[1:38:56] and we prayed before service Lord we
[1:38:59] need the $100 to make our our insurance
[1:39:01] payment and after service brother Bob
[1:39:03] handed me an envelope and I opened it it
[1:39:05] was a check for $110 and it was a rebate
[1:39:08] that had been owed to us and he'd been
[1:39:09] holding our mail since we've been in
[1:39:11] Halifax God knew all along now we could
[1:39:15] freak out we could get worried we could
[1:39:16] be we could sit there and not hear a
[1:39:18] word that brother Gerald preached or we
[1:39:20] could go in and say say Lord we're
[1:39:21] trusting you that you know we have need
[1:39:23] of this and so not only did we do that
[1:39:25] but we went and we went we we we paid
[1:39:27] our bill and then we were able to go to
[1:39:28] Mary Browns and get a 10 piece for
[1:39:30] $9.99 and it was a good
[1:39:33] day and then we're down to a cent or 10
[1:39:35] cents in our bank account but all our
[1:39:36] bills are paid so what do we need to
[1:39:38] worry about he owns the cattle on a
[1:39:39] thousand
[1:39:40] hills I've shared the testimony I've
[1:39:43] never missed a day at church to study
[1:39:45] for an
[1:39:46] exam didn't mean I got straight A's but
[1:39:50] I passed every exam Church do I get jobs
[1:39:53] because of my grades do I get jobs
[1:39:56] because I'm a an amazing person I
[1:39:59] believe I've gotten jobs because God has
[1:40:02] opened the door he's our provider I find
[1:40:06] favor where no one else finds favor I've
[1:40:09] worked in companies where I felt that my
[1:40:12] coworker deserved it more than I did and
[1:40:14] my boss couldn't stand him just couldn't
[1:40:17] get along with them they were constantly
[1:40:18] butting heads and and the guy who was
[1:40:20] that my boss bunny hwith was a was a
[1:40:22] calm quiet easygoing guy like everybody
[1:40:26] liked him and somehow he could never
[1:40:27] please my boss they just never seem to
[1:40:29] work out and yet I walk wal in I'm not a
[1:40:32] Texan I'm in Texas right I'm a
[1:40:35] northerner right
[1:40:37] Yankee and I get along great with him
[1:40:39] and I get promotion after promotion and
[1:40:41] bonus and recognition after recognition
[1:40:43] why God's grace nothing I did my buddy
[1:40:47] was just as talented harder working many
[1:40:49] times did a great job and God gave me
[1:40:53] favor God provides amen we're not
[1:40:56] getting there because of our Perfection
[1:40:59] we don't have what we have because we're
[1:41:00] such hard workers or we're so smart or
[1:41:02] intelligent or educated we have them as
[1:41:04] Believers because God has given us what
[1:41:06] we have need of amen and as we honor him
[1:41:09] he honors us that's just the way it
[1:41:11] works and I can say that in every aspect
[1:41:13] of my life when I've given up
[1:41:15] opportunity he comes back and he gives
[1:41:17] me more than I would have ever gotten
[1:41:19] because he meets my spiritual needs and
[1:41:22] He blesses me naturally as well but my
[1:41:24] rest is not in the natural I've given up
[1:41:26] great jobs and I've taken lower pain
[1:41:29] jobs and I've done the the dirt work and
[1:41:32] I've done the fun work and it doesn't
[1:41:33] matter in it all Christ is with me
[1:41:35] because what I put him first amen you
[1:41:38] young people as you're searching these
[1:41:40] things and these different ones
[1:41:41] recognize that he's the one that's going
[1:41:43] to provide he's the one that's going to
[1:41:45] lead he's the one that's going to get
[1:41:46] you where you need to go and without him
[1:41:48] it'll be pointless anyways cuz you won't
[1:41:50] have a bit of contempt
[1:41:52] you won't have a bit of
[1:41:54] contentment Paul says let us labor
[1:41:57] therefore to enter into that rest what
[1:41:59] he said don't be like the children of
[1:42:01] Israel don't don't let the sight of
[1:42:03] what's coming hold you back from the
[1:42:04] promise that's attached to it don't let
[1:42:07] the battle that's coming keep you back
[1:42:09] from what's beyond that battle the
[1:42:10] victory that's there amen don't let
[1:42:12] circumstances or hardships hold you back
[1:42:14] your rest is not in your skills or gifts
[1:42:16] your rest is that he's called you to go
[1:42:18] there and he's wrote your name on the
[1:42:21] deed for that piece of property and you
[1:42:22] can go get it cuz he's with you he goes
[1:42:25] ahead of you the captain of the host is
[1:42:26] with you brother says this he says you
[1:42:29] have an intellectual conception you have
[1:42:31] a theological experience but when it
[1:42:34] comes to a time that you really when you
[1:42:36] really find the real thing you just sell
[1:42:38] out everything else and you close
[1:42:40] yourself to this Paul knew what it was
[1:42:42] he found out that he was harnessed to
[1:42:44] something like we put a horse in a
[1:42:46] harness it's to pull something and Paul
[1:42:47] knew after this experience and three and
[1:42:50] a half of typing the experience he had
[1:42:52] with the Bible he realized that God had
[1:42:54] chosen him and had harmonized him by the
[1:42:57] Holy Spirit the experience that he had
[1:42:59] to pull the gospel in the presence of
[1:43:01] the Gentiles he said the spirit itself
[1:43:03] harnessed him you're saying this is rest
[1:43:06] Jonathan this is
[1:43:08] rest he says and today as Servants of
[1:43:11] Christ we become harnessed hooked up we
[1:43:14] can't go we're logged in with it
[1:43:16] harnessed to the word no matter what
[1:43:18] anyone else says you're harnessed to it
[1:43:19] there's something about about it that
[1:43:21] you just can't get away from it you've
[1:43:23] been yolked up with it by the Holy Ghost
[1:43:25] and it has yolked you to the word no
[1:43:27] matter what anyone else says it's the
[1:43:28] word that's always harness up with it
[1:43:30] put in the Yoke with it to the word by
[1:43:32] the spirit he was harnessed he had
[1:43:34] learned on the backside of the Arabian
[1:43:36] Desert there when all his former things
[1:43:38] and experiences and ambition that he had
[1:43:42] been stripped of those things stripped
[1:43:44] of those things he says that's what we
[1:43:47] find today that we must be stripped
[1:43:49] first he said and people don't want to
[1:43:52] be
[1:43:52] stripped the Methodist brother wants to
[1:43:54] hold to a little bit of his Methodist
[1:43:56] teaching uhhuh the Baptist brother wants
[1:43:58] to hold to a little bit of his Baptist
[1:44:00] teaching see but you've got to
[1:44:02] absolutely be stripped of everything and
[1:44:04] just born again
[1:44:07] fresh he says and he take up from there
[1:44:09] and let the Holy Spirit lead you can't
[1:44:11] say well now my daddy said when he got
[1:44:13] in he went in the church he shook hands
[1:44:15] with the pastor he's a good loyal member
[1:44:17] church we got people still doing that in
[1:44:19] the message they're good loyal m MERS to
[1:44:21] their local congregation they're
[1:44:23] associated with the ministry but they're
[1:44:25] tied to family and habits and traditions
[1:44:27] rather than the life in Christ it's
[1:44:30] become a community rather than an
[1:44:32] experience it's become a habit rather
[1:44:35] than a life amen we ought to be good
[1:44:37] loyal members of a local
[1:44:40] body but that's not where it's at but
[1:44:43] that's the attribute of a Christian amen
[1:44:46] is that we support each other amen we
[1:44:49] don't come in just selfishly
[1:44:52] we come in to help the person next to us
[1:44:55] men we come to help pray them through we
[1:44:57] come to worship to to to to invite God
[1:44:59] into our presence so that his atmosphere
[1:45:01] so that his presence can do a work that
[1:45:03] none of us could do on our own that's
[1:45:05] why we come in and set an atmosphere
[1:45:07] amen he says that might have been all
[1:45:09] right for his race but we're another
[1:45:10] race see now we must come back to the
[1:45:13] Bible times for this day he says people
[1:45:16] don't want to be stripped you don't see
[1:45:18] this in the pictures but Christ was
[1:45:19] crucified naked he was stripped of
[1:45:23] everything he was punched he was slapped
[1:45:26] he was spit on he was bruised he was
[1:45:28] beaten to to almost to death and then
[1:45:31] they took all of his clothes off and
[1:45:33] made him walk
[1:45:34] through the streets people looking at
[1:45:36] him he took the literal embarrassment so
[1:45:38] we don't have to cuz that's what we
[1:45:40] deserved that's what we deserved was to
[1:45:42] be stripped
[1:45:44] bare amen but there's still a stripping
[1:45:46] down that has to happen to us doesn't
[1:45:48] have to be public in and of itself but
[1:45:50] it still has to happen amen that we've
[1:45:53] got to be broken down and it's a
[1:45:55] stripping of our self well and our pride
[1:45:56] and our ambition and our desires and it
[1:45:59] all the way down to our control that's
[1:46:01] the thing that he's looking for is to
[1:46:03] let us give our control over to him Paul
[1:46:06] would say this in Galatians he says I'm
[1:46:08] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:46:10] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:46:13] in the Life which I now live in the
[1:46:15] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:46:17] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:46:19] Paul said crucify with Christ and
[1:46:22] there's a literal portion of that and
[1:46:23] there's a there's there's a metaphorical
[1:46:25] part because brother Braham says we were
[1:46:27] in Christ and so we were crucified with
[1:46:30] him because we're in him when we when he
[1:46:33] took all that pain when he took all that
[1:46:34] suffering when the sins of the world
[1:46:36] were laid on his shoulders and he was
[1:46:37] judged we were judged with him then and
[1:46:39] so we don't have to come into the
[1:46:41] Judgment now but then there's a daily
[1:46:44] dying out that Paul talks about as well
[1:46:45] there's a daily crucifixion a daily
[1:46:48] struggle and that's the labor to enter
[1:46:50] into rest it's the dying out that we're
[1:46:53] doing and when we die out then we can
[1:46:55] rest amen there's a daily laying down
[1:46:57] cuz Satan's always here trying to get us
[1:46:58] to take the reins back in our hands say
[1:47:01] the situation is too dire you got to
[1:47:03] take control you got to step
[1:47:06] in and God's saying wait wait wait I
[1:47:09] thought you were yoke to me I thought I
[1:47:11] was the one leading Satan wants us to
[1:47:13] pick it up and God's trying to keep us
[1:47:15] with our hands off of it amen Paul said
[1:47:18] I'm not living Christ is the one living
[1:47:19] through me I died so that Christ could
[1:47:22] live but he says every day this old self
[1:47:26] wants to rise up again and I got to keep
[1:47:29] dying I got to keep killing it every
[1:47:30] single day Paul said I protest by your
[1:47:34] rejoicing which I have in Jesus Christ
[1:47:36] Our Lord I Die
[1:47:39] daily then he said but I keep my body
[1:47:41] under subjection lest that by any means
[1:47:44] when I have preached to others I myself
[1:47:46] should be a cast away every day he says
[1:47:48] I've got to keep this thing under
[1:47:49] control
[1:47:51] Jesus said you must be born again he
[1:47:53] said in order to be born again it's
[1:47:55] letting yourself go and die and the
[1:47:58] spirit of Christ come into you then
[1:48:00] you're no more yours it's Christ in you
[1:48:02] see the Holy Spirit Paul said I Die
[1:48:05] daily yet I live not I but Christ liveth
[1:48:09] in me so we see what this this rest
[1:48:12] means and this rest is a union it's a
[1:48:15] marriage it's a resurrection of Christ
[1:48:17] inside of us amen it's a joining of you
[1:48:19] and I with him and we read earlier that
[1:48:22] he's the overcoming one he's the
[1:48:24] accepted one he's the powerful one and
[1:48:26] our lives then are just a reflection of
[1:48:27] him our rest is that his attributes his
[1:48:30] person his life is what makes us and
[1:48:33] takes us through not me not you it's him
[1:48:37] and US amen we start to rest because we
[1:48:40] can see it's his doing not my
[1:48:43] doing that's why it was so beautiful
[1:48:45] when sister Leah got healed it wasn't my
[1:48:49] doing but it shows that he's
[1:48:52] here whether I see him or not whether I
[1:48:55] feel him or not it doesn't matter he's
[1:48:58] here and he's doing the works that he
[1:49:00] promised to do in our lives each and
[1:49:02] every one amen it's his Perfection not
[1:49:03] ours it's his acceptance not mine it's
[1:49:05] his power not mine brother darl Ward I
[1:49:07] love what he said he said the the the
[1:49:09] the requirement of the ministry he says
[1:49:12] is to pray the prayer of faith to
[1:49:15] believe he says it's up to God to do the
[1:49:17] healing no man heals no man delivers
[1:49:21] it's the holy spirit that does the work
[1:49:22] but it's up to us to believe and act by
[1:49:25] faith on what he tells us to do by the
[1:49:27] word of God Amen this is the key to all
[1:49:29] of it is to let go and let God have his
[1:49:32] way amen it's Christ in you Christ in me
[1:49:34] doing the works that he promised and
[1:49:36] it's the pleasure of his Good Will in us
[1:49:38] and not my will and not my desires amen
[1:49:41] the musicians could come as we close on
[1:49:43] this last
[1:49:44] quote brother Bram says it's written
[1:49:47] over in St John about the 15th chapter
[1:49:49] if you abide in me me and my word in you
[1:49:52] see the word abides in you see then ask
[1:49:55] what you will and it'll be done because
[1:49:57] it's not you it's the word that's in you
[1:49:59] this is the rest and brother B would
[1:50:00] talk about he says you've got to have
[1:50:02] thus sayeth the Lord every day you've
[1:50:05] got to know that what the word says is
[1:50:06] Christ speaking to you so that when you
[1:50:09] speak it it comes forth it produces
[1:50:11] because it's the promise of God being
[1:50:12] quickened by the Holy Spirit he says the
[1:50:14] word is God see God in you God is the
[1:50:17] word because in the beginning was the
[1:50:19] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:50:21] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:50:22] dwelt Among Us he said now in the return
[1:50:25] of the Holy Spirit bringing the word in
[1:50:28] us and it abiding in there then it's not
[1:50:31] you that speaks it's the word itself
[1:50:34] coming out so it the word will perform
[1:50:39] the work amen God bless you yet
[1:50:43] stand we put this pressure on
[1:50:47] ourselves and there's no place for it
[1:50:50] there's no place for it because God
[1:50:51] never put pressure on us to do God put
[1:50:54] pressure on us to
[1:50:56] believe our only requirement is to
[1:50:59] believe to have faith in what he says
[1:51:02] and then he comes behind and he
[1:51:03] vindicates it and what is it what is it
[1:51:06] that that gives us that refreshing it's
[1:51:09] when we've believed and then God
[1:51:11] vindicates it by bringing it to
[1:51:13] pass they sat up in that upper room for
[1:51:15] 10 days 10 days and nothing happened we
[1:51:19] don't really know how it felt in there
[1:51:21] we don't know if there was a maybe there
[1:51:22] was a tremendous atmosphere in there
[1:51:24] maybe there wasn't maybe it was hot and
[1:51:26] sweaty and stinky we don't know maybe it
[1:51:28] was crowded maybe they were fearful we
[1:51:31] don't know but they stayed there until
[1:51:34] something
[1:51:35] happened and that's what was the rest is
[1:51:40] when something happened that was
[1:51:41] according to the word that they were
[1:51:43] believing and every day we're believing
[1:51:45] aren't we every day we're trusting
[1:51:46] whether it's for healing for provision
[1:51:48] for salvation for guidance
[1:51:50] for grace for a better attitude for
[1:51:52] forgiveness whatever it might be we're
[1:51:54] believing and then what is the rest the
[1:51:56] rest is when it happens that what you
[1:51:59] believe for is finally there and you can
[1:52:00] say there it is and you rest but the
[1:52:03] struggle is to believe it until it
[1:52:04] happens and then what happens is God
[1:52:06] gives you the next little bit of word
[1:52:08] and he brings you up a little bit higher
[1:52:10] and maybe it's a higher Faith it's a
[1:52:12] it's something you've never seen before
[1:52:13] you've never experienced before and so
[1:52:15] what do you do you labor to come into
[1:52:17] the reality of that and it's by faith
[1:52:20] it's by holding yourself to the word of
[1:52:21] God it's by saying Lord you promised it
[1:52:23] and I'm going to stay here until you
[1:52:25] give it and I'm not going to move I'm
[1:52:28] not going to back away I'm not going to
[1:52:30] let Satan push me around but I'm going
[1:52:31] to hold fast until you bring me this
[1:52:33] rest this refreshing of your word coming
[1:52:36] to pass in my life because I can't do it
[1:52:39] I can't do it so I can rest from my
[1:52:42] work and now all I've got to do is trust
[1:52:44] and believe that you're going to come
[1:52:45] through for me that's the rest and then
[1:52:48] what happens is he starts to work in US
[1:52:50] and then when he's done that work then
[1:52:51] he starts to work through us and now we
[1:52:53] start to be effective in the kingdom of
[1:52:55] God Amen that's where we'll go next
[1:52:57] service God bless us amen God bless you
[1:53:00] each one let's just bow our
[1:53:02] heads Heavenly
[1:53:06] Father Lord there's a place of rest
[1:53:09] there's a place of
[1:53:11] Peace Lord there's a place of
[1:53:13] satisfaction and contentment that's
[1:53:16] available to every child of God lord and
[1:53:19] it comes by resting on your word Lord
[1:53:21] that's the foundation for everything
[1:53:23] that we have hoped for and dream for
[1:53:26] Lord all that we believe for is found in
[1:53:27] your
[1:53:28] word and Lord when we don't see it
[1:53:31] happening when it seems like nothing's
[1:53:32] going on Lord help us to rest Lord let
[1:53:35] our faith rise up Lord May the standard
[1:53:37] of the Holy Spirit come up Lord and may
[1:53:40] we just stand there and believe Lord May
[1:53:42] our confession be that your word is yay
[1:53:44] and amen Lord that no matter what we see
[1:53:47] or hear Lord no matter matter what these
[1:53:50] five senses would tell us Lord May that
[1:53:52] Faith super sense rise up and say We
[1:53:55] believe We believe We
[1:53:58] Believe Lord we're resting on your word
[1:54:00] this morning Lord we're resting on the
[1:54:02] leadership of your Holy Spirit Lord the
[1:54:04] great power that you've placed into the
[1:54:06] church Lord to do in us what your word
[1:54:08] says we're supposed to do Lord I pray
[1:54:10] you help us to lift our eyes up a little
[1:54:12] higher Lord that we believe in a way we
[1:54:15] haven't believed before Lord that we'd
[1:54:17] see your Sovereign Grace in our life
[1:54:19] Lord and that we trust that the work
[1:54:21] that you started you'll not you'll not
[1:54:23] Lord rest until you finished it like
[1:54:25] Boaz with Ruth Lord Lord that you'll go
[1:54:27] and you'll go and you'll go that word
[1:54:29] will work and work and work Lord until
[1:54:32] it produces that finished element in
[1:54:33] each one of us we pray Lord you see the
[1:54:36] needs you see the hearts you see the
[1:54:39] bodies you see the finances you see the

[1:54:52] you give each one peace and rest this
[1:54:54] morning Lord not just in this service in
[1:54:56] your presence Lord but as they walk out
[1:54:58] Lord and face the challenges of this
[1:55:00] life Lord day by day may they feed on
[1:55:02] your word Lord may it produce Lord that
[1:55:05] rest that we're looking for Lord if
[1:55:07] they've never experienced it Lord I pray
[1:55:10] you fill them with your spirit Lord give
[1:55:12] them that great rest give them that
