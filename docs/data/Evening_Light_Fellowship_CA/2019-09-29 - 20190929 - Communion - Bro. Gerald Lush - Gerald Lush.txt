Laurie dream show me Kyle worry open mine and warm aha and show me Cal Lori a man preach the Lord God blesses a man we think of for this opportunity to come once again interpret a cup the communion and we have missed it for quite a while we pray the Lord forgive us but again we thank the Lord for the word that is off to if you do it a man but again you don't have to do it once a month you don't have to do it you know and so often what as oft as you do it and by the grace of God he should do this in remembrance of me so we thank the Lord for this opportunity to come and partake of the wine to partake of the bread but grace to us to give us the revelation of what it means grace to give us the revelation of what it represents your many gonna take it but it's just a form of godliness amen and they're going to take it as as the Bible indicates in Corinthians they're gonna take it casually you know and many many will take it casually why it's just it's just a tradition they've done it so often it become common to them but for the true believer brother it brings it brings us to Calvary a man the reality of Calvary in our hearts a man by the grace of God so we're not going to join to a tradition it's just not just always just a bring cup cup of wine and and it's just some unleavened bread no brothers sister in our hearts it's revealing a revelation of what it represents I was reading the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ and what he did to redeem us what he did to bring us here tonight today Amen by the grace of God to fellowship one with another with a hope not not just a religious form but it is the Blessed hope of eternal life why because we've been redeemed hey man I've been redeemed you a man we want to show the Lord we appreciate it a man by doing this in remembrance of him by the grace of God so God be the glory so by trust that your heart will be in it not your head but your heart not just your hands and your mouth but your heart a man we're going to predict of the natural bread the natural wine my brother it's going to want to have a revelation in our hearts by the grace of God we're going to tell you with understanding we're going to take it with revelation we're going to tell you with an experience with with the one that it represents that I've had an experience with Jesus a man and the life of the blood that He shed is in me and the life of the blood that He shed is in you by the grace of God that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the life of the blood coming in to us amen so I trust we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I trust we have the evidence of the Holy Ghost believing believing God believing the word walking in the light a man representing reflecting Jesus Christ so that it's not you the lives is Christ that liveth in you he said I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you as I said that brother one time a certain pastor and he was trying to prove to me a Trinity and again he gave me that verse in John and he said I pray the Father this is what he quoted he said one and he Jesus was one he said I pray the Father - he said give you another comforter three and that was his evidence as far as he was concerned it proved that God is in three persons it is a Trinity until finally I went back and I said brother you should have went on a little further a man you should have read I said a few more verses I stood the whole truth nothing but the truth a man man shall not live by bread alone but the word of all the Word of God and I said don't add to it and don't take from it so I said now go on down and Jesus said I'll not leave you comfortless and he said I will come to you a man and so I said then he said you will I said there'll be a relationship there have been experience he said you'll know that I'm in the father the father of me I you you and me a man so praise the name of the Lord is not three persons is one and he's just moving one to the other because Phillips had show us the father he said you mean you don't know me he said he that sees me sees the father a man so thank God for the word brother it's basic it's simple so we think of for bringing us to the revelation Oh the guardian a man so that when we brother were going from time to eternity we know who to look for amen we know who we're going to see and it's Oh what it's going to be the father and there's gonna be the son that gonna be the Holy Ghost well it's gonna be Jesus it's gonna be our Lord our Savior Jesus Christ amen so he said I and the father 1:3 brings in it brings us into a oneness with him as well by the grace of God so thank God for the revelation a man so help us to be sincere help us to appreciate what God has done but appreciate what God's doing amen for if you recognize what he's done you'll recognize what he's doing a man truly honestly sincerely by the grace of God so let's be in prayer every going to the word and going from the word to the communion and I'll try not to be too long and I was thinking of going into doing God a service without his will because I felt that was going from hearing and seeing the word I have heard but now I see but here at God's Way see it God's Way and I said you've got to have a right motive a right objective and so on if not God doesn't recognize it a man and I'm going from there to doing God a service why are why are we going to do this where are we going to do to do that we're hearing this we're seeing that and we got this motive and this objective and brother why why are you here why do you believe this why are you living this why are you taking this this stand for the Word of God a man brothers good you got to have a right motor right objective and the right motive and the right objective in our hearts is for the glory of God amen you know what it is is to give him the glory for what he's done for what he's doing a man don't take it casual don't take it for granted by the grace of God amen but just just take it really serious and and let let our lives reflect that we've got the experience of Calvary in us they met that as he died laid down his life so we lay down our lives for him a man and he gave us his life to pick up amen to go from time to eternity by the grace of God so I trust that it's real to us that it's just not religion it's just not a doctrine it's not a fairy tale oh it's a nice story and so on no no it's a reality it's a revelation a man of God we're dealing with a real God we're dealing with the real Lord Jesus Christ brother is not history he's not back there 2,000 years he's here a man he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you so that same Jesus brothers sisters that laid down his life the same Jesus that suffered what he suffered and endured what he endured sirs for our salvation he's here amen because what he did he's here to make it flesh in you and me amen so again again and again through the Scriptures is not me or you that lives is Christ that's living in you so the life that you have lived this week was it Jesus in you was that Christ living in you was a Christ using your mind your thoughts your feelings brother amen so that they're looking at you and say well that's not natural that's not that's not them no no it's another power is another anointing and that's why we have the attitude that we have we have the spirit that we have we have the we react the way we react or act the way we act why because it's another life on the inside of us it's another life in our souls and again forget mom and dad and grandma and grandpa we don't want their natures we want the nature of Christ amen by the grace of God and brother the communion is causing us to go back and remember how that we get the nature of Christ amen now that I am what I am by the grace of God man to God be the glory so the Lord bless you we're going to sing only believe all things are possible as we go to the word and welcome our sister Cardella a man god bless her a man praise the name of the Lord they gotta make her blessing to us with her presence thank God for what he's done for her and we thank God for what he's doing Alleluia come on let's believe with a complete belief Amen no question no doubt let's believe that God as Ealdor a man and going and it's continuing on from the natural to the spiritual to heal you physically and to heal you spiritually amen and by the grace of God and again we're experiencing a spiritual healing and we're going to have physical healing amen even to the change of our bodies even to a glorified body like is glorious body and brother were longing for it we're hungry for it we're thirsting for it I don't know how much longer it's going to go on because I know like I've expressed it to before everything is changing and everything is getting worse people are getting worse and whether probably God have brought out in this message right here again we're in an insane world and the people are insane they are they're not normal anymore they don't think normal they don't act normal they don't dress normal no no there's nothing normal anymore but brother fr how much further the Lord's going to let it go I don't know and I have been talking to the Lord about it I'm thinking on it and meditating on it Lord I said where we want to go now because you said if you didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved so Lord we want you to shorten now Lord we maybe if well we could say it go on for another 10 years another 20 years 30 I don't know but I may go on for another day or two a minute because why because what the prophet of God and what the Bible forecast whether Bible prophesied and what the father told us about brother we see it it's made flesh now among its everywhere out there in that world because again as I said it's not the world I lived in fifty years ago and it's certainly not the world I lived in now just a few days ago because everything has changed change change change and brother we never heard of murders like we're hearing a mur today we're never heard of what's going on in the world this is going on that's going on they're doing this they're doing that where brother is on such a scale now oh my brother I trust that it's the prophecy fulfilled even now Lord that you will bring it to an end amen sorry and his talk to her the love of many waxing coal well we're that we know that's there and he said this is going to happen that's going to have we know all those things are coming to pass amen we see it brother is here and it's in other parts of the world as well and so we thank God for the for the revelation of the word to give us hope a man hope unto eternal life hope to the resurrection and the rapture I pray God we believe in the resurrection I pray God we believe in the rapture a man we believe that that brother's sister is already in progress we are on our way home by the grace of God so God blesses as we go into the word God bless there we go into the communion amen brother that will truly identify with his death burial but thank God for his resurrection and brother that we experienced death burial but thank God for the resurrection and the rapture amen God make it I pray God make those promises more real than the seat you're sitting in God made those promises more real than the person sitting next to you a man let Jesus be more real a man to us not history but to the present tense dick that he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age praise the Lord let stand and sing only believe all things are possible oh baby only be all things a man only Billy a

more of the anointing of the Holy Ghost father truly the power of the Holy Spirit that our Lord it is eternal life it is the resurrection father is the power for the rapture father it is the baptism

[Music] all things are possible [Music] [Music] now now believe us know this now Hey praise the name of the Lord Alleluia now I believe raise the name of the Lord Amen hallelujah turn with me to st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 26 a man you can keep it in mind to see what the Lord will do in Israel today because it's the today they're going to have a Feast of Trumpets a man and the prophet of God said that the seventh seal is for the bride for the Gentiles he said the seventh trumpet assists for Israel a man so god blessed them as they observed this Feast of Trumpets a man to God be the glory a man it is later than we think and in verse 26 of Matthew 26 and as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins thank God that he's got he's taking our sins away thank God that he's cast our sins into the sea of his forgetfulness and verse 29 but I say unto you I will not drink it's worth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom and he's drinking he said of this fruit of the vine praise the Lord this is what his life produced this is what he did in his life to redeem us a man and when they had sung and him they went out into the Mount of Olives god bless his words you may be seated turn with me to first Corinthians chapter 10 first Corinthians chapter 10 and as I indicated I was maybe thinking of going further with a message of doing God a service without his will wrong motive wrong objective not hearing and seen the word the way that God would want us to hear and see it so we end up doing God a service but not according to his will not according to his word the will of God is the word of God they met but we'll get to build we'll get back to that in another service but so it's not to take too long this afternoon that I want to share with you again some thoughts from again the last message that brother Branham preached and it was communion and really it wasn't a sermon that he preached because brother Perry Greene had preached and brother Branham was asked to come up because they were going to have communion and brother Han came up and made some comments and some thoughts concerning communion this was after our brother Perry Greene had ministered in Tucson Tabernacle but this was December the 12th 1965 and it was six days later that brother Branham experienced the accident when he was on his way from Tucson to Jeffersonville six days after he spoke concerning communion it's amazing that the last message it didn't have to do with the seals it didn't have to do with the the church aegis it didn't have to do with that he was ministering to the bride a man who had come out of all these things and was entering in more and more into the Word of God a man by the grace of God so he ministered on communion and again as I said I want to highlight that God still requires us to take communion a man I know that there are believers who don't take communion and they feel that we don't have to take communion and they feel that we have entered by the opening of the word and the revelation of the seals that we have entered into a spiritual communion and we are feasting spiritually on the word and drinking the word brother than eating the word but again nowhere are we instructed to stop taking the bread and the wine while we are yet in this less a man well we're yet in this flesh and where we are yet experiencing sin and unbelief even in our flesh and all around us we need to take this representation a man of our deliverance from the influence of sin from the influence of the world the flesh and the devil a man brother we're gonna as I've said as for as long as we are in this body been in this flesh that was born in sin as shaped in iniquity we need communion we need to remind ourselves a man of what God has done a man to redeem us of what God has done to take away our sin and what God has done to cast our sin into the sea of forgetfulness what God has done to bring us to a place where as the Providence said or the Bible says that no man can lay a charge against God's elect why is because of what he did 2,000 years ago and because of we're going to remember a man through the bread and the wine and the same God for a man this is our Redemption praise the name of the Lord we're not going by just by the letter of the word by going by the spirit of the word and brother the Holy Ghost reveals to us yes what God has done and what God is doing what God will do but the Holy Ghost is revealing to us our redemption through Calvary a man oh what I'm redeemed there I'm redeemed there but again there's no redemption without Calvary there's no redemption without what Jesus did a man this in the third pull of his ministry a man he came and he did this he did that just thing his ministry was only three and a half years a man and then he then he had come to the third pole and he knew he knew what he had to do and brother there was a change in in Jesus when he was in flesh and brother they ought to be a change in the bright as long as we are in this race as we approach the third pole brother of the word of God for this hour burger that the world autumn's knew a change in us our families ought to see a change in us brother we ought to see a change in one another we ought to know that something is about to happen as brother they'd they they saw a change in Jesus the disciples saw a change in Jesus brother he even the scribes and the Pharisees and the Jews and those that Jesus administered true they saw a change in him when he was approaching the third pull of his ministry a man but there's not just settling in and say yeah I believe God did this I believe God did that so yeah it's all over now we're just waiting for the resurrection waiting with the rapture but as I said God is waiting for you God is waiting on me amen because why'd the resurrection rapture is in me as well as it was back then we're waiting on Jesus the whole world was waiting on Jesus the father was waiting on Jesus ain't mad buff and the Holy Spirit as they were waiting waiting for this to happen but it had to happen there was no other way that it could be done amen and Jesus went in and he said as the worse he sweat as it were great drops of blood a and yet cemani he was so stressed with what with the revelation of what he knew was going to happen so stressed with the revelation of what he knew that that he had to experience a man not just in not just on Calvary but on his way to Calvary even he was going to suffer much brothers for the Bride of Christ in this are we're going going to experience that stress a man for the resurrection that stress when the rapture and getting at a time into eternity because I turned to this for that to happen in our lives we're gonna live that we're gonna have the yield amen to the prophecy a man of this hour in this age a man listen it's going to be so serious that he said if he didn't shorten time there be no flesh say and it's going to be so serious that Jesus said he said when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth a man oh yes brother we got faith we believe in what God has done no no no no no there are many and I would say most belief so-called believers today are under under under Malachi 4 they don't really believe the message they don't really really believe what God has done they don't really believe what God is doing but then it's gonna get fewer and fewer and fewer as I say there's something like 2 million or more around the world that say they believe Malachi 4 that say they believe God has sent a prophet and so on but like I said so does the devil but again the devil is not going to live it but brother Jael impersonate it a man and he's going to head to it he's going to take away from it and brother we were I have seen that experience brother after fit over 50 years identified with this word 53 years identified with this word identified with this message brother I have seen a tremendous change a man so the way and I have seen the Holy Spirit is pulling away pulling away pulling away father and brother everything is

gone brother when the current when it comes to our relationship here but it is convinced fleshly but there is spiritual amen and there it is to eternal air is coming by time there's coming by eternity a man a man a man you try the old glorified body by the grace of God then when Jesus came back he came back in a glorified body anybody but now he could eat and drink but he didn't need no bathroom or

real to us amen so that we get we get to eternity time is gone a may there's no knowledge of time there's no thoughts of military nothing just grace of God to us Amen we're in eternity were with our father a man a man father father father that's what it means there in the in the Epistle of John the love the father that God had bestowed upon us that we can call him we've recognized our Father and

believing by the grace of God that may be my Grob my grandparents will be there a Maya because again they they they did they serve the Lord they love the Lord and I remember somebody saying recurrence Ernie my mother's father my grandfather Goldie and he oh yeah it you know he couldn't he wouldn't go to read this book but he read this one oh yeah they they there's no good to give him any any any other books he wouldn't be to read them he couldn't read but they says he would spend all day reading the Bible oh yeah and I remember when I was there one time and where he was living you any of course he was sister Goulding's mother father-in-law and so on and I was there and he came out and I would see I could see him now and he was leaning on and on a stove on the oven and then he said Earl I got a question and he said it's in the Bible and he said he was just reading in the Bible and he says it refers to God as being terrible and any and he said is God terrible I said yes he is but I said that that terrible doesn't mean I it doesn't mean I said what we think it means I said in the English I said when it comes to the bio it means he's great and that means a he's powerful he says he's a high above all the rest and I said that means he's so terrible in in his power so terrible in his strength and so on means it's great and big and high oh he said that explains that thank you very much and he went back to reading his Bible a million and again even my grandfather lost and I remember were there one time and I was talking to my grandpa my grandmother lost and my grandfather was in his living room and he was sitting down with the Bible in his lap and he was reading and and my grandmother said oh she said Jo she said you watch she says it won't be long now she said nearly crying and because she said every song he sits down with the Bible starts to read she said just a little short while later the tears begin to fall hey Mae and he was starting to cry and and started to worship God a man so praying by the grace of God that they were going to meet up my grandfather's there and my grandmother's by the grace of Almighty God you're going to meet yours there but they're

around 20 years old they're not gonna be just teenagers no not by any means any man because the glory by belly is from eternity the glorified body is created by God amen in the beginning God created it and the body and were and he's waiting for us to come and get into it a man is represented by that by the theophany you get into a theophany and the part of God said they're all there and they're fellowshiping oh yeah and he said those he said when Luther showers fellowshiping with those in that age and I and he said the others in that age and he said and those are the believers from this hour their fellowship II Amen well with another by the grace of Almighty God how do I know you till one day after the resurrection rapture we all come together as one body amen as the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God brother because we're looking for a resurrection of the break and then brother we aware there's an invisible union of the Bride of Christ the the earthly bride and the heavenly bread there is an invisible union going on now are you one with Christ that's the question that but that's a challenge to our faith are you one with Jesus are you one with Christ amen so that it's not you that lives us Christ I live within you your thoughts your words your deeds your actions your reactions that it's not you it's Jesus in you amen brother where they were that the world looks at you they're going to see Jesus that I'm Minister person answers to Burns's funeral I said listen I said lord I pray grace of one of these days that we're gonna meet her as a young woman and I say oh yes she was a witness she was a testimony I've heard of those that she lived with she was a testimony to those that lived in their necks lord of her I said you get up there and you say you're gonna say oh I didn't know this I didn't know that and I said I said the guy said the Lord is going to show you on a picture of sister burns and he said well I was made flesh and I live next door to you I was made flesh and I live right there I was made flesh and I and I was called truly I was made flesh it was called milking burns or so on Isis or sorcerer and brother I trust by the grace of God that we are that kind of a witness so that God can tell those your neighbors your family your friends and says I was made flesh a man here look that's me oh that's my brother no that's me the life that he lived the life day my sister lived the life that my mother father day man that's me and them they they didn't live their life a Mary they couldn't live that life it was okay with me in them through the Holy Ghost amen me living that life Oh brothers a tremendous challenge to our faith is it Christ in you when it comes to your thoughts your actions and your reactions amen are they negative or positive is it Christ in you or as air is it just your worldly nature and and you're born with that and then it's Satan influencing you oh yeah Satan influencing our trailer the battle is on we're in a battle man we're in a battle between the the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ the spirit of the devil because the devil is using our thoughts and our emotions and our feelings and God is using in our hearts using our faith so I hold hallelujah if you're living out of your heart it's just faith your spiritual amen sons and daughters of God you think like God you act like God you talk like God old brother I pray grace for such for such an experience with Jesus amen I pray grace for such a oneness with Jesus amen that there's no way that the devil can influence me it's Christ in control brother amen and when the enemy comes him with with the wrong thoughts and and he's moving in our feelings and our senses amen the Holy Ghost is in our souls and he'll go to remove on up through our spirits and what do they do you quote the word because Satan is moving on thoughts and feelings by God is in the soul coming forth to Satan it's written get me honey amen oh it's in the flesh it's in our thoughts but brother or new creatures in our souls we're born again in our souls Alleluia by the grace of Almighty God amen and that's where the East there Theresa was standard against the enemy he's there should always speak the word by the grace of God amen so when was the last time you rebuke the devil amen when was the last time I tell you if you had the Holy Ghost senior and Satanist there with it with his country thoughts its negative thoughts it's country and negative fairings brother the Holy Ghost is there to keep reminding you of the word keep reminding you of God keep reminding you of Jesus amen hallelujah to keep reminding you and that you're a son and daughter guarding and to bring forth what's he doing he's bringing forward your nature as a son and daughter of God amen that's right praise the Lord now if you're at work or if you're among family your friends or neighbors no matter what it is you're still Jesus amen oh yeah no matter what drew Jesus came in contact with he didn't it didn't matter him he just went and lived the life he talked it he acted it a man oh they did they didn't like it think they said he was he was born of fornication see there's nothing else they couldn't he couldn't lay a charge against him personally to say that he was this and he was this and he was that no no I don't know now he said your your your seat of the Satan he's your sons of the devil hey babe yeah your father's the devil he said but they looked at him and said you're born of fornication that's the only thing they could have used against him fornication why because of his birth a man because to them they didn't believe in the virgin birth they believed that she was she she was with a child before she and Joseph got married that's why they you're born of fornication yeah as we were born out of out of wedlock and so on no it was virgin born a man it had nothing to do with the fresh earth or Joseph but it was God amen by the grace of God it was God that was forming that body by the grace of God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah brother sister God Elvis God give us that revelation that we are we're not born of fornication amen I'm born again by the Word of God I'm born the end and where they come from come from eternity and that's why it's pulling me back to eternity amen it's pulling me away from time and getting me to think and act more more more eternal by the grace of God oh my brother's sister again as I said the prophet saw this back years ago but he saw it he saw it getting fewer and fewer and fewer believers relieved like believers they activate the believers the life was what was a different life you know and from from the rest of the world out there no no they were absolutely different Eden this was where they worked you know or in their homes they were totally different and brother it wasn't a put-on it was a new nature because they were born again now it was the son of God living his life in that flesh as it was in Jesus so now it's in you and me praise the name of the Lord amen brother sister thank God for what he did at Calvary thank God that he laid down his life and picked it up again so that we could lay down our lives and pick it up again by the grace of God amen so that we have access to eternity we got the passport amen oh yeah you you want it we got the life of the blood oh yeah come on see it's like again it's like good I know the Prophet mention it and about you know oh yeah and about you know this one going up to the door to heaven and say what's the password Oh I'm a Lutheran I'm this and I'm that Oh what oh that's not the password good over go over there and think about it Oh next one or what I want what's the password oh I'm a Methodist I'm this nine that oh yes no you better go over there it's not the password and went on I'm Pentecostals and and I got this and I got no yes but that's not the password you get if you don't know the password go over there with there with the others and think about it until finally the young boy came up yeah and they said okay my son why does the password he said password he said I trust in Jesus blood he wasn't professing to be this church or that church or I believe this and I believe that no he said I trust in Jesus blood my Redemption and brother the angel didn't have to do it the got the door opened automatic hey man the door open the angel said enter my son enter in to the joys of the Lord amen brother we got to have the right password and it's not William Brennan and it's not just so over the seven seals it is not this or that read this revelation of what God has done don't other agents are done in this age and God has revealed this and God has revealed that no brother I tell you regardless of his Luther's age it was justification in Christ his faith was in Christ Wesley Christ amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Christ yes a man and now the oatmeal the word that mighty angel descending from heaven with a shout its Christ our faith is not just in what they did it's in the word amen because they're under the control of the word and brothers sister I trust what we got the Passover got the past word rather by the grace of God amen as we go into the communion God grace Passover listen brothers is serious and if there's anything very serious I think when it comes to brother Brennan was communion he did say to our brother from Africa one time and he said well he said maybe this church is better than us he said because they take communion every month or take me and every Sunday rather and he said we only do it once a month maybe we should take it every Sunday he said you know and so on why because he recognized the significance and the importance of the communion God forgive us for delaying it as long as we have if we need to be reminded more and more and more of the price that was paid we got see if you're going if you're gonna live in humility brother is the constant revelation of what he did to redeem us that humble you amen Lord I was born this way but you had to do this to get me back you did it Lord to show your love now lord help me to do it to show my love for what you did to show my love for you amen to show our love for one another by the grace of God so brother let me say again six days after he exhorted on this was the accident and we know that sister Branham was killed in the accident she died but just think the proper God he told his son brother Billy Paul he said put my hand on her he couldn't do it himself but Billy Billy Paul reached out and got brother Browns right hand and he laid it on her and he prayed and she came back to life yeah Billy Paul told the round she's gone she's not breathing and she did but he prayed God bring her back I don't doubt what brother Brown felt in himself that he was going a man because six days after after this sermon is the accident at six days after the accident the prophet went home to be with the Lord amen so I don't think these thoughts right here are just coincidence or just so that just happened just before he died that's all no no I believe it was for a reason amen because when he had come to the end of all things he needed communion amen he needed the life of the blood that was represented in the wine a man we needed a life of the blood of the body that's represented in the bread please God help us to believe he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed even unto the change of our bodies the prophecy if you can't believe for divine healing how can you believe for the rapture and the devil is getting us more and more caught up with natural things than spiritual Satan is getting getting us caught up with those things what for it is to weaken and do away with our faith for healing you know we want to heal ourselves now more and more and more Peter getting caught up with that yeah brother sister I tell you the more and more the devil put your emphasis on this and this and this and this that's the less and less and less faith we have because we got this much faith and the devil saying no this okay this my straight no and and faith is getting less and less and less no wonder Jesus said when he can't really find faith on the earth and you know what our brother Scofield said that faith was he said faith he said belief in the whole body of revealed truth I let be honest there's not many I believe in it the whole body of revealed truth they're gonna believe concerning the seals but they won't believe communion it's amazing they're gonna believe concerning the seal but there and believe all I see it and I hear it and so on no no they're not hearing it or seeing the way God wants them to if they hear it and see it the way God wants you to hear and see it you're gonna produce the life that God wants to see grace to us he said I believe he said I want to say this before we start the communion and I believe that we are we have seen enough in our day that we live in that we ought to really give all of our being to God don't just give him your time for Sunday and Wednesday and oh your prayer and the more your your your grace at the table no no you got to give it all to him 24/7 morning noon and night it's Christ leading you sons and daughters are gotta led by the Spirit of God not just Sunday and Wednesdays amen constantly and he said we ought to really give all of our being to God and we should really serve God okay are you serving him oh yeah well if you don't serve the body you now serve me yeah so I talked about being friendly and being friendly it's not just oh hi oh he's friendly no he's not No courteous but not friendly we're friendly you go and you do this for them you do that for them you do this you do that your friendship is what you do not just oh hi oh nice to see you okay see you later no no you're living for one another that's that's what that's what that's what being friendly is you're living for one another a man-god Elvis brother I'll tell you this if a lack of friendliness is going to keep us out of heaven not running if not many gonna get there that's true god help us he said I believe that he has blessed us with a direct answer to Scripture he said we are not blind we are here we've arrived and he said we can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leaving the people oh my what would he say today he said that we can't stay too much longer he said we be in a complete insane institution and we would it's like I said when someone that I know went into the Waterford hospital and they were nervous they're going to visit somebody they said oh he said I can I go with I want something with me to protect me and she saw two people going up the aisle dressed a certain way oh he said to their Christian they belong to a certain church so she went up and got between them and walked down the aisle only to discover that they were also two patients but she didn't know that yeah I'll tell I'll tell them she got down the aisle somewhere and they did someone identified them as two patients what oh yeah they were dressed the way they were because of something wrong with their minds yeah so brother-sister we're living in an insane as an institution yeah I see that insanity like I said everywhere would no matter where I go and again we were even at a supermarket the other day and I saw saw this lady go by while she's dressed like the world but I never seen it before the way she had her hair personally I don't think it was her hair she me she was leaving the impression that it was you know the way it was everything was done on her head but I'll tell you it was way up and I said what in the world is that never seen it before I said that's insane and it is oh yeah it was back here like that and it looked like her hair was all you know were platted and and wrapped here and here and there sticking up there sticking up there and goodness that's the Lord I said the world is insane I said want me it is not going to be it is oh yeah he said we being in a complete and sane institution the whole world would be we are at the end time and he says brother green ended up there seeing these things are true and they are true they're not a myth he said they are not just something that we imagine there's something that's been directly given to us by the Word of God and manifested publicly before us and we know we are here we are at the time a man it is the time of insanity and brother that shows the devil's taking control grace to us he said anything as a beginning as an end but he says that which had not a beginning has no end and we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred and he said I call on a few days ago but some very fine Christian gentleman that's never had this and he understood that we take communion literally and they take it what they call spiritual communion yeah just believers that feel that they're taking spiritual communion but they want take it literally they don't feel we got to do that now but again let me say as long as we're in this flesh we got to take it long as we're fighting sin and an unbelief we got to take communion amen because our faith is in the finished work of Calvary we got the victory through Calvary and he said that reason I'm saying this so that you would understand what you're doing and he said you walk into into anything blindly and you don't know what you're doing if you can't even have a confidence if you don't know what you're doing but you must understand that you are doing what you are doing and why you are doing it you must understand what you're doing not just a tradition or a church thing no no it's the reality to me is Lord this represents you what you said represents your blood and the bread were ever sending your body and brother I'll tell you it was beaten as I said before when it comes through pictures of the crucifixion most pictures the crucifixion are not the way they should be because he was totally red with blood remember he shed his blood and brother not being satisfied with all the all the everything on his but on his body where where they whipped him and whipped him and whipped him and he bled and bled and bled brother they went and drove that spear into his side so that the blood wasn't just on the cross but the province of the blood went down to the earth he said to redeem there and he said the he said the life of the blood comes back to you and me how many really recognize the life of the blood in you and they really appreciate it and they are really grateful with the reality of the life of the blood cardi Alice he said you must understand why you're doing it and why you are doing it you must understand not just tradition it's not a church tradition but to a lot of people's tradition yeah and if we take the Word of God isn't that God that we are taking and I said exactly right sir that's true but we read here Paul taught taking the literal Lord's Supper this do in remembrance of me this do not this or this or this he said this a man well I gonna take the word yeah but this was what the word did the word was in the beginning was the word the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us by the grace of God so he said we are to take it but Paul said the thing in order and he was a prophet of the New Testament see he said right there we are taken and this is the last instruction he gives to the bride how can we walk away from it we can't do it under there they had the sacrificial lamb and that Israel kept that for a memorial and it was actually used one time coming out of Egypt but then they kept that as a memorial all down through the age well if the law being a shadow of things to come they took it now he said I do believe that communion is the Lord's Supper and we only have three physical divine orders left to us communion feet washing water about he said that's the only three that's perfection and he said that's the only three orders we have and now he said we would say communion should be just taking the word yeah he said I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord's Supper until they have taken the word into his heart a man so he said because I'll read something in a few moments Ethan on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army and they said they do not believe in any form of water baptism they said we don't need it and now he said we don't need what about Chisolm why are we baptized said the water can save you and the blood saves you I agree the blood saves you not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inward work of grace has been done amen so we must we also beyond the communion when we have taken the Lord our sacrifice into us as a matter of spiritual birth into us his body we live by him by the word we also should symbolize it because it's a commandment repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you see there are three things we must do as symbols the Lord's Supper people washing water baptism now he said the salvation army takes it from the point the dying thief when he died he wasn't baptized Jesus said he would be in heaven that's exactly the truth but you see he only recognized Jesus right there in the hour that he was dying and he said that's the only opportunity he was a thief he was always out and he was out and he said he as soon as he seen that light he recognized it Lord remember me that was true but you can't use that as an excuse to say I don't have to be baptized I don't have to take you know I don't have to do this what brother there's a lot of things that we would say we didn't have to do if we wanted to use that as an excuse brother praise the Lord brother we've been on that long we've been on the go for a long time beyond what the when it comes to Jesus the arm what the thief knew he was he was judged by what he knew he was judged by history Israel his reaction to what was going on and to the Christ that was him crucified a man oh I believe if he lived he would have been baptized if he lived he would have took communion most definitely amen oh yeah he'd have a greater maybe a revelation of appreciation for it than a lot of so-called believers today considering what he saw and considering what he experienced amen the other thing just cast Jesus down but that one brother what a revelation seed of God for him to look at Jesus they didn't listen this done this man has done no no no bad thing he said we deserve this he said to the other thing we deserve this but he said he won't but he did it he did it for him he did it for you he did it for me what are we willing to do for him life you don't want to do nothing they just want all he's gonna bless me he's gonna give me this he's going to give me that now that he did that I don't have suffer night well we got identify with him in his suffering but in the Fellowship of his suffering but not only in his death that's right there that's like brother be like I said always said when we're in Pentecost he said we only we only took the first part of the verse to identify it with him and he in his in his death where he laid down his life for us picked it up again but the Bible but he said go on and he said and that Fellowship of his suffering they want the first but not the less grace to us just a few moments he said but to you I you know that we should be baptized and refused to do it that'll be between you and God the same thing in the communion you know you should do it if you don't he said between you and God and when we take this communion it isn't just a thing saying I'm coming up here and I'm going to eat some bread and I believe I'm a Christian but if you notice the Bible said he that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord and that word on worldly means casually if you drink it and eat it on just casually like a tradition no he said you're guilty of the blood and the body of the Lord and instead of redeemed you will be condemned your attitude got me right your spirit can't be right your motive got to be right your objective got to be right for the glory of God see you've got to live a life before the people and before God and the people and that shows that you are sincere now just a moment longer and he's in the Old Testament when the sacrifice or a statue or ordinance he's the soy's water baptism and ordinance so his feet washing and ordinance so is the Lord's Supper an ordinance he said blessed blessed is he that does all his ordinances and keeps all of his statutes and all of his commandments that he might have a right to enter into the Tree of Life amen he said he died in our stead he did but we're how many of dog did since then yeah did physically but not spiritually and if Jesus didn't do what he did all the seed of God be dead cut off from God completely but thank God God from the beginning started with blood is able oh yeah blood sacrifice blood sacrifice blood sacrifice and their faith recognized greed they needed redemption through the true ritual blood and they knew that God was gone one day said the perfect sacrifice the lamb slain before the foundation of the world yeah if he wasn't slain before the foundation of the world and God had to wave it all off and start again but it was before the foundation of the world in the mind of God hallelujah but he said when I come to communion he said they kept on going under finally it become a tradition and it is and he said there's no sincerity there's no understanding and he said we don't want to take communion like that we want sincerity and understanding hallelujah we must come with this deep conscience of what we're doing not just because it's in it's an order he says you go to church many times you give out an old soda cracker something break it up like bread break it up people who smoke drink and everything else because they are member of the church and they're come and take the Lord's Supper he said that's filthiness before God he even the sacrifice your holy days your sacrifice become a stench in my nose saith the Lord yet he ordained them to make that sacrifice but the way they treated it it become a stench and he said that's the way we take the word to many Christians he said does that a man and it's a stench in the nostrils of God I pray that what we do today will not be a stench in the nostrils of God a reverence and respect your spirit and your attitude when you take of that bread and drink of that car so he said you don't take the Lord's Supper by a tradition you take it because it's the love of God in your heart my lord and mercy amen in keeping the commandments of God and he said that's what you take it for and he says you've got to be sincere and God wants the depths of your heart you remember the very God that brought you here on earth and that is the one that you are serving and if you're doing this because he said so because it's his order and then we want to come up with deepness of sincerity knowing that by God's grace we have been saved and we are and we love him and we feel his presence and we see it change our lives and we're different people we don't live like we used to and we don't think like we used to he said like in the Bible and the spot he said there was talking I said the two books becoming one the book of life the first book of life coming up when you were born he said that was your natural birth but there's then there's a spiritual birth a man he was talking about being borne by his natural parents he said what was it that was there was another William Branham and he said a little spot of eternal life down there the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there a man the natural William Branham was born in sin but there was a spiritual William Branham had the seed of God in his soul but he said once he said I looked up and I said I am NOT the son of Charles and Ella Branham he said there's something calling like my little eagle he said oh he said I'm not a chicken there's something yonder all great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home amen there's something in me calling and then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it and then it began to grow and he said brother been around snaps his fingers and they said that uh that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to never be remembered against me no more and now we just stand justified as though we had never seen that's tremendous that's a tremendous faith that you stand before God as if you've never seen amazing thank God thank God old brother when you consider that how can you not love him with all your heart no yeah thank God he that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be never remembered no more against me we just stand justified as though we had never sinned in the presence of God amen he said in this communion just something I go up for an order and say well the rest of them take this I will do it's a revelation that I am part of him and I'm part of you and I love you and I love him and we'll and we're taking this together as a symbol of our love to God and our love and fellowship to one another amen I'll tell you that's the tremendous that's the challenge to our fee love God love one another well you love one another as you love Jesus hey man if God sees the love you're manifesting to one another does he really see it as the law that he's expecting you to look to manifest to Jesus amen that's tremendous that is I tell you this message anything is a challenge to our faith believe us now this well I believe that I believe that yeah believe it's out of this I believe that doctrine best doctrine they don't believe yourself this it all comes down to this grace grace he said in this communion just something I go up for it an order and say well the rest of them take this I will too he said it's a revelation that I am part of him and I'm part of you amen yeah I love you and I love him we're taking together as a symbol of our love to God our love and fellowship to one another as tremendous why is he ministering those things because he's seeing less and less of it it's getting less and less and less as I said he didn't the Saints were no longer feeling bad when they good service come to an end and their fellowship ended and that's why they cried he said oh I won't see you now into Sunday Wednesday and Wednesday they cry again I want to see you now to Sunday and so on yeah he felt he said that and now he said also he said he felt something else taking place he saw it what was it it was the older Saints that used to be on fire and filled with the power of God the anointing of God the love of God and now he said dirge right he said they're dry right dry sit now it's just okay god bless you go on that's it grace I'll finish he said what are you he said you're a Christian the Bible says let a man examine himself and so leader media let'em eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for either eight of them drink it unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body and he said you're a Christian you live before everybody as a Christian and he would take that and don't live as a Christian you're not discerning the Lord's body you're putting a stumbling block in somebody else's way and I tell you if we get into this message here on doing God a serve without as well oh he's challenging the faith not of those out there he's challenging the faith of those in Panem tyreq oh he's challenging the faith of those who profess to believe his word and believe the message oh yeah because he sees that they are depending on this - depending on that they're leaning on theirs leaning on that and they judge themselves by this oh yeah I got this I got this I had this I have that no do you have do you have the will of God yes you can do God a service without his will oh yeah and there's many today that are doing God's service we're come to believers they do this do this oh yeah I'm doing this for the Lord no but do you have his will there's like I said hearing seen the way that God wants you to hear and see having the right motive and the right objective for what you do and so on probably God said you can do something but had the wrong motive and wrong objective amen but by the grace of God he said you can do this you can do this you can do this for God for God for God for God but he said is it the will of God there's many doing a lot of things but it's no there's not for the will of God grace brother grace when we take this it shows to the church that I believe every word of God I believe he is the bread of life they come down from God out of heaven and I believe every word that he says is the truth and he said I do not swear I do not curse I do not dare do those things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows it bears me record amen remember when Israel was the type of this they had journeyed 40 years in the wilderness and their clothes never wore ever wore out oh my and they come out with one people one among them without one people one among them and he said with two million as a type of this Oh as I said two million professing to believe this message around the world and he's there with two million as a type of this well what will the anti-type do the body of a sacrificial animal did that for them what would the body of Jesus Christ Immanuel do for us brother yeah if they threw a lamb in Egypt and put the water over the doors over the door all over the fence posts and so on they had to go this way and that way like a cross you know her brother if that if the blood of that lamb brought God on the scene and bless Israel and did this and did that all the power the anointing what ought the blood of Jesus do for us man look what a dud for them probably Gossard they came out and they drank the water out of the rock they came out did this they came out and did that yeah they went through the river on dry land yeah how those tried to do it and got drowned they weren't being the plan of God hey man so brother we got to make sure we're going to do it according to the will of God amen the communion according to the will of God in your life and in whatever else we do for the Lord make sure it's according to his will is not just a religious spirit on you it's the Holy Ghost in you controlling you oh my again it's amazing how the Prophet brings this out to his own church to his own people because why because he witnessed a lot of people that were doing things but it wasn't according to the will of God they were doing doing God a service but they never had the will of God so you want to do something for God make sure it's the will of God in your life well I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that I'll tell there's not many believers today they're doing the will of God no they you know I find a lot of a lot of excuses I can't do this and I can't do that and I can't do that because because because well you change it for this one you're changing for that one why not change it for the Lord oh yeah oh people make plans for this make plans for that plan for that yeah yeah I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this but you know comfort of doing something for the Lord oh I can't do this I can't do this yeah God give us the Holy Ghost brother to be spiritually minded they were gonna make sacrifices for him as he made for us by grace amen God bless your listening hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord as we approach the communion the sing number 29-yard there is a fountain filled with blood brother

after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me they mad grace wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily or casually shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord yes amen god help us to examine ourselves in the light of the

amen grace grace grace and he revealed himself in this day and in this hour that's why we have that that often said of Christ why because the prophet of God said that was as close as anyone that looked like what he saw in in his garden when he saw the division of Jesus standing there and looking at him he said this was as close as he could get to anybody and of course they say also that our brother Tom Brown that he also looked like the Jesus that Jesus saw at the girth a man so thank God that he revealed himself in this day in this hour that he's real he's not a he's not a fairy tale and not just a 2000 year old story it's the reality of Christ down through the ages and in this last stage he revealed himself to his bride hallelujah hallelujah there sing again I love him brother barber leaders true [Music] a heavenly father Lord with the deepness of sincerity is the Prophet taught us Lord we approach father as part of the service - thank you Lord for your grace to us horn -

the glory praise the Lord in John 13 now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come a man that the bride would know her hours come it says that he should depart out of this world on to the Father but having loved his own which are in the world he loved them unto the end thank God and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded and then cometh II to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto Him Lord dust thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto Him what I do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto Him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me and Simon Peter saith unto Him Lord not my feet only but also my hands my head and jesus saith to him he that his wash needed not saved to wash his feet but it's clean every whit and year clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and were set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you he called me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you very verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if he do them God bless his word to our hearts happy moved to the foot washing saving my soul thank you Lord for making me hold thank you Lord for giving

[Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you you you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen praise the Lord God wishes may the blessings continue with us beyond the end of the service can we attend you with us through this day and through another week maybe we never lose the revelation of Calvary a man we need to keep be mindful constantly praise the Lord that I not that I will be redeemed I am redeemed by the grace of God and he testimony of grace is Calvary he laid down his life but picked it up again in the book of John it's written when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said unto them concerning the temple and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover in the feast day many believed in his name and when they saw the miracles which he did but Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and he knows you and he knows me he will commit himself unto those that have committed to him they may but he knows whether or not we have committed ourselves in our souls to him he's not in our physical beings and religious lives no but it's in the new creatures in Christ a man we have committed all things unto Him not my will father thine be done not my will Lord Jesus your will that's what we're living for the will of God the will of Christ but to those that emit after his resurrection 2000 years ago it says they believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did but the faith wasn't based on the Word of God it was based on the works but as believers our faith is based on the word we believe the word we're not putting the emphasis on the signs and wonders but we're putting the emphasis on him the word it is if word made flesh if what God promised God was doing in Christ through Christ redeeming us amen remember again that the angel told would have items' to stop using those signs he said you're causing the people to lean on a signpost he was ordained he was predestinated to use the sign but then to get them to believe the word yeah but they kept believing believing the sign and that's why they they constantly pulled on the signs that's what they wanted to finally he wouldn't do it even in the prayer lines if I told you this he said would you believe see God is testing our faith God wants us to believe his word they man it's not just signs and wonders and that man got assigned that man God's got wonders and so on he'll do this and you'll do that there they were more into brother Branham than into Jesus that's why he did ask the Lord that question he's a lord and he's in the hotel he said Lord they want to come to the hotel he said his is to see me or see you they want to come to see with him realm they want to talk to him breath they wanted me to run to pray for them they want to be healed but again he's like he brought out him in the message either hearing I heard but now I see but I think was the other message that we brought out too and went through me and concerning don't have it there see inside it was another message concerning the motives and objectives you know but their motive wasn't right their objective wasn't right and he said even in that book you know he said he said why do you want to be heel for what do you want God to do this for he said just because you're sick and you want to meet well oh no no that's not your right motive not your right objective the right moral objectives is for the glory of God if you want to give the glory to Jesus amen by the grace of God so no matter what we want to do whether we want it for the glory of God amen you want God to do this for you oh yes oh I'll be better no get you have your vote of change your motives change your objective Lord I'll give you the glory amen I'll testify and give you the glory thank you thank you thank you amen so we'll give give the glory to Jesus you might you have we all got needs we've all got needs so when the lord meets that need give him the glory amen praise the Lord no matter what it is give him the glory amen we'll give the glory to Jesus and tell of his wonderful law but and brother if he knows your motive is right your objection was right your spear is right then eat on the heel healed acknowledge you yeah you'll commit you'll commit himself to you if you commit himself yourself to him you got to commit yourself to him he'll commit he'll commit himself to you yeah oh yeah because he can trust you he knows you're gonna be there too to be his witness his testimony amen so Jesus did not commit himself unto those that believe because they saw the miracles because he knew all men and needed not that any should justify all men for he knew what was in man you knew it then he knows it now he knows what's in you now amen so we pray the grace of God that he what he sees in us is acceptable in his presence what he's recognized in you and me a man it's again it's a reflection of His grace and His mercy and his love and his Redemption amen because why because we have a right attitude and a right spirit and it's free it's revealed in us it's made flesh in us amen he never said he recognizes that that we're living to serve Jesus amen give him the glory god bless you this thing what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus all precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other fount I know nothing but the blood of Jesus and we'll turn to our brother balm God blesses and God's grace to
