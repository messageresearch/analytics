why don't we stand and U let's just sing here we are in your presence it's 572 praise the Lord I believe he's here tonight so let's let's just yield to him tonight and let the word come forth in power and demonstration right into the heart and pull pull from the Throne of Heaven tonight amen now let's just sing that here we are in your presence lifting holy hands to you here we are in your presence lifting holy hands to you here we are yes Lord amen praising Jesus for the things he's brought us through here we are amen praise the Lord to you oh here we are is in [Applause] Jesus for the things he's brought us through sing it one more time oh here we are in your presence lifting holy hands to to [Music] you oh here we are praising Jesus for the things he's brought us through amen and God bless you just wanted to welcome each one here here and we've added a couple and we've lost a couple so we're just trusting the Lord amen I thought it was beautiful just that was a wonderful special sister Morin and a wonderful anointing and you know where uh I was thinking as I was sitting there you know and not everyone shows up and it's special services and you want everyone there but listen we come for him amen amen we worship to him and if it was only two of us here and a preacher he's here the same as whether there's 30 or 50 or 100 or a th000 amen and I thought that was a good reminder that we're here for him we're here to lift his name we're here to praise His name we're here to feed on his word and we're here to to to worship him and to thank him for the good things he's done for us amen amen I trust you've come expecting and been fellowshipping a little bit with Brother David he's you know studying a bit and fellowship a bit in these things and you know I'm just trusting for good things tonight and you know you think about what he was talking about last night and I was talking to him and I said you could have gone so many ways and so many directions and what he's preaching is a bride message because remember what brother Bram said he says when the bride recognizes who she is the rapture will go and you know what he was telling us is he says you're written in the word and the word is coming out through your life whether you realize it or not whether you can place it or not in the moment God has orchestrated Our Lives to produce the word amen and whether we understand it and whether we we we're in the moment or not yet God is doing it and whether it's in David's life whether it's in in Jonah's life Jonah looked like he was all out of kilter but brother bam says God knew his prophet he knew what he would do and he orchestrated events to turn that disobedient that unhappy Prophet into a sign and a Wonder for the message that he was supposed to give to a people and they received him because of his Disobedience not despite it amen it's a wonderful thing amen I want to come higher into into Christ amen I want to step out of this world I want to step out of this flesh and say Lord let your word live in my life let me see it but regardless let me have faith that when you're working in my life that it is you that's working and it's not just happenstance or circumstance amen amen I I want to apologize to Brother David we had told him 620 we were going to leave for church and just a bit of a brain fart so we put him under a bit of pressure there and so we gave him a bit more extra time tonight but there's no pressure brother there's no pressure we're coming expecting the good things and God will answer and he'll come on the scene every time amen so let's just keep him in prayer as he comes I'm going to ask us to sing that song 11:29 I need you Lord I need you Lord right now amen as we invite him to the pulpit I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I lift my [Applause] hands to worship at your throne I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I need you Lord I need you Lord right I need you Lord I need you Lord right my hands to worship your I need you Lord I need you Lord do we know that song in his time do you know that song let's just go ahead and do that as we prepare to meet with our lord Jesus tonight gracious heavenly father in his time in his he makes all things beautiful in his son Lord please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you'll do just what you say in your time in your time in your time you make all things beautiful in your time Lord my life to you I bring May each song I have to sing be to you love in your time gracious Heavenly Father you have heard through song which has been said to be prophecy you have heard these people prophesy tonight Lord that all things are made beautiful through your time and how that in their lives they want to express in the song of Our Lives Lord God we want want to express you we want to express your love your command Lord as it were Lord over all the Ws of the devil all over over all of the the sins of the flesh over anything Lord that would stand between us and you that's my prophecy tonight Lord that's the prophecy of this congregation who has come sacrific their Time Lord sacrificed their lives to be here this evening that they might hear something from you so I'm asking you just get me out of the way Lord Jesus just get me out of the way that they might hear something that if you would grant us the time that we might leave again these doors their lives would go out emanating Christ to a dying generation to a Dying World that you might be honored and glorified with every heart and every Life In The Name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord I love you and I'm not afraid to say it and uh thank each and every one of you tonight I uh for coming out we uh understand there's the the sniffles going around and the flu and whatever it is and but God knows all about those things and he has reasons for it and I must admit that I thought we were going to go a certain direction as we were talking last night there about the seed of David and and mentioned the Seed of Abraham but we may have to wait for that one brother for at least until tomorrow we'll see but I I as we felt the Lord start to pull us a different direction I thought it was interesting cuz uh a sister there at home mentioned the prophet Jonah and then as uh brother Jonathan gets up the two that he mentions the second one was of course Jonah and I'm going well Lord you know what you're doing and so here we are and let's turn as it were get back on the right page here but let's turn first to the prophet Isaiah and it's the seventh chapter and we'll read the 10th through the 14th verse Lord willing do you love the Lord tonight I know you do and that was Sister a beautiful testimony in that song and in this particular verse that we shall read first uh it's a king and he's of course ruler over a nation and and the God and and God challenges him to do something and I'm sure you've heard these things before they're not new to you and uh starting there with the uh 10th verse and moreover the Lord spake again unto ahaz saying ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and he said hear ye now oh House of David it is a small thing or is it a small thing for you to weary men but will you also weary my God therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse evil and to choose good so then let's turn on over so he's God has challenged him to a sign and he said I'm not going to I'm not going to do it but God says that's all right I'm going to give you one anyway so it really doesn't matter sometimes whether we respond or whether we don't and so then in Matthew the 12th chapter and this is a place where uh he's been speaking to the scribes and Pharisees and uh they're not always the most kind people to him of course and at this point he comes down in the 38th verse they're kind of demanding to him it says then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and an adulterous generation seeks after a sign and there shall be no sign given it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth gracious Heavenly Father we've read your word Lord you know what direction you're wanting to go with this and I'm standing here as your representative and so what I'm asking is you get me completely out of the way that you speak to your people for your honor and glory and for our service to thee in Jesus name amen please be seated and before we start it's kind of along the same theme that we were speaking about last night and and how that every scripture there's different levels there's the fleshly level there's the spirit level there's the the soul level or the nature that's behind the scripture and then there's also a life that comes from that that's displayed through that nature and I like to give this as an example we have this there's many places in the scripture where you'll find then it when it talks about the scripture it'll say the scripture can be transitive and intransitive or intransitive and it comes from the original uh as it were the the text of the word trans which means simply to move we use it for transportation for uh you know a lot of different ways that we use it transition which means you're moving in or through a certain thing and and so that word is used a lot and so when we're talking about scripture and if it's transitive it means it contains something in that scripture that's going to be moved or it can be moved and it can be moved from one place to another as I move the water from there to there and we can move it over here so the water is [Music] moving and so but it's being carried in this bottle and that's kind of like the the natural part of the scripture we are carrying a certain thing within us if we're born again again Christians we are carriers of whatever is inside of us and if you're born again Christ is inside of us so we can move this it's transitive I'm moving it all over the place but if we take the lid off we can take it and we can take part of the contents it's good thank you brother now I moved the contents from the bottle into me but where did it go I mean really where did the contents go well brother it went into you but there's more than that because now the contents that I consumed have become a part of me those contents and you know just because it tastes so good and I kind of need it for a dry throat those contents have be become part of me and I have become part of them because the human being cannot live without water there's another thing and even another level then that goes with that because not only did I consume the contents of the water but the life that is provided into Waters through into human beings came with it so the life that is behind this water was just moved where it became transitive to me and the life came with it you can't see it I can't really even feel it but that life came into me without feeling without I mean yeah I tasted the water that part of it but the life behind it is the Unseen portion and many many things in the scripture are that particular way let's look at because it became transitive so let's look at this according to Isaiah there uh we'll go to Luke the first chapter and watch how God moves his life from the scripture into human beings and if we were to the brother asked me last night for a title on last night's message we just the seed of David I suppose and tonight I would give it a name just so it can jog into your memory the greatest sign never seen and how that uh he also mentions in Isaiah Behold a virgin shall conceive and that's or that's the one that we read and there's another place in Isaiah that it talks about it but in Luke the 1 chapter we start down about the 26th verse because it takes on a carrier just like the bottle is a carrier of this water and so there there in verse 26 and it says and in the sixth month Luke 1 and 26 in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto the city of Galilee named Nazareth so now God has given a particular bottle to be the carrier of his word so God is sending this Angel as it were uh Gabriel to Galilee which is named Nazareth to a virgin esposed to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David so we see like we talked about last night that the that bloodline ran up to a certain place and it comes up to the house of Joseph but that Joseph had no physical part in the birth of Jesus he was just he also was a carrier of the seed or of the promise that was unto Judah and so as the carrier of that God comes to this and he sends this Angel uh to a virgin that has been espoused or to be the wife of Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name wasy Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women so this Angel is now delivering the life of God that's in the carrier of Gabriel and he's delivering this life he's delivering these words to her and uh highly favored among women so on and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation is this so she's got things going in her mind like whoa what's happening now that's would be you know the modern way of saying what just happened here and she's listening to this Angel it's not you know probably wasn't a real common thing for her to be seeing Angels it's most people don't catch him very often and and so she is being troubled in her mind about this it says she was trou L and when she at this saying and that's that's that's going on in her mind and what what is the Sal what is this all about but watch what the angel recognizing her being troubled at this he recognizes it as fear because he immediately says unto her uh and the angel says unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God so we see immediately that the the Discerning Spirit of the Holy Ghost is in the in this Angel because in Hebrews 4 the holy spirit is the discerner of the thoughts and intense of the heart all it said that that she was troubled but the real thing behind the troubling was that she was afraid she was in fear of this Angel and what does he do remember God is a Creator in the beginning God created we talked about the light behind that when he speaks to her fear not what's happening God is speaking the fear out of existence for that sister she's our sister you'll get a meter one of these days and so he's speaking the fear away and uh fear not you found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus and then he begins to give a description of the power of creation the power of God that's going to come forth to her in her womb and this power of creation is going to bring forth he says you're going to conceive in your womb you're going to bring forth a son his name was Jesus and and he'll be great he's the he's called the high the son of the highest the Lord God uh or and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David so he's prophesying these different things and even as David was we talked about last night when the anointing came and created him as king God in him as king it took many years many struggles many trials before he actually took that throne and so here it is and he shall reign over the house he's going to take the Throne of his father David he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever the kingdom of his iners shall be no away and so he's giving this description these different pieces of what the word of the Lord is going to place in her womb he said it's the greatest it's the greatest sign and yet it's going to be so small and Mary said unto him you know he says H H how can this be how shall this be knowing I don't know a man I don't I don't I've never been with a man that I can receive this in the normal way and the angel answered her and said the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so what again what just happened here we see that God sent a special carrier a Gabriel and he has within him the word of the Lord and this Angel messenger that comes forth from Heaven is going to open the bottle as it were on the word of God and said hey Mary he brought it to the right people friends we have heard from an angel messenger and it came with a special message that's in a bottle that we call the word of God and part of that bottle you know this is uh we were talking I think last night I've been accused of I don't read enough quotes So I you know I kind of thought wow I really don't read very many I I listen to them and a lot of times I don't even write them down I'll just write maybe the tape that they were on and y'all have the tape so you can go back and listen and so on the next place I went to Brother Rich Cobbs and I told him I said I got accused of not reading any quotes so tonight I'm going to read 13,000 quotes they all you everybody's like I said seriously and so I just opened one of the message books and read the word Bible because brother brandham used that word 13,000 times and if you run it up want to run it up over 16,000 add the word the little letter S on the end Bibles so that should tell us what the carrier of the message of the hour is and it came through a special vessel but what's in the vessel was the carrier brought to us so that the life can can come into us by means of the I'll in this case I'll use the carriers because God the word of God comes to the prophet and he opened the lid said after the seals this is a new book and every scripture can somehow point us to Jesus Christ there's tons of them I couldn't even begin to tell you how it does it I read it and read it and scratch my head and go I don't know Lord but the life is there and so he has come and he's said these things to Mary and the life now think about this this is you know the great sign that's spoken of by Isaiah and he's he you know Behold a virgin con shall conceive and I think it's the 53rd chapter and he where he talks about all the different things that come with that anointing that and that come with that and how that here is this great tremendous sign from God and nobody can see it not even Mary and she received it how many things do we receive from God that we can't even see nobody could see it because it was in the womb her natural womb and we've heard brother bandam talk about how the great Jehovah God and all the things he made and all this he said he became so small he became as it were a single cell in the womb of a woman and this is the greatest sign that there would ever be and nobody can see it not even the carrier now as that seed began to man manifest and those cells began to multiply and pretty soon Mary couldn't even hide it anymore in fact they're saying that she's a bad woman because look at that stomach and that's not normal to and that's how rumors get started as people start looking at you know by eyesight and uh they were looking at her and wow she's had not been with her husband it was probably a soldier all the things that went it there is a reproach for bearing the unseed word friends so if you're suffering maybe on the job or maybe from your neighbors or maybe even within your own family sometimes it's a reproach for the word of God for a word that they can't even see but they're starting to see a manifestation in your life it's like I remember I was hadn't been serving the lord too long and uh I was in college at the time and I'd been taking a a psychology class and this teacher oh I was the big antagonist you know I was the rock and roll bum and and the the hippie and so forth and so I had all this well in the meantime but you know over a certain amount of time there the Lord came and manifested himself to me and I got saved what we call got saved and that last term in college he goes what in the world has happened to you and it began to be because he he got very antagonistic because that the change was so dramatic between fall and spring he goes you are like Dr Jackal and Mr Hyde I said all I know is I got saved and so there was a reproach with that and even some of my my friends uh remember we went to a concert one night and there was a young woman and I I had graduated from high school with her but I hadn't seen her for a long time and we went to a folk concert and she was there and after the concert everybody was clearing out and she just stopped and looked at me and she goes what happened to you and I said you know what are you talking about she goes she goes I was sitting here looking around and she goes you are the only person in this entire Auditorium that has peace in your life and I said well it's Jesus because it was and it becomes evident because I wasn't I hadn't even said anything to her about the Lord but she could feel that presence and there was a reproach but in her case she said tell me about it so I mean you have different ways but even though that life is growing and it's growing we we we bear a reproach for many of those things and how did uh it comes unseen it's the greatest sign that ever was and yet it comes in an unseen fashion in in something that can't see it can't taste it can't hear it can't smell it but it's a life that begins to come forth from the interior of the believer because just like the Holy Ghost overshadowed her in her womb and it brought forth Christ so does the holy ghost in your life there will be times when friends I got to be honest I don't feel it sometimes there's that you know those things that go through our heads because that's the Battleground well how can you even be saved look what you just did it's like H well that's when we have to go back to the very word that we came Born Again by and say all I know is he said he will never leave me nor forsake me that's all I can say Satan he will never Le me nor forsake me because I know I came according to his sacrifice I like to think of of job because uh job you know he was he had words over his life that God had spoken he's perfect he hates sin and the different things that God had spoken about him and how then Satan came and took away his life and his F you know his his family and his oxen and all this stuff and he comes down and and then the second time when Satan comes back he takes away his health his health just becomes so miserable and so terrible even his friends when it says said they St saw him they stood a far off they couldn't even recognize him there will be times in your life when your Christian brothers and sisters may not even be able to recognize you because of something that God has allowed to come in your life and it'll be a reproach because he was reproached for us and some of us have to be exposed to reproach ourselves to understand the gospel living in us and but the thing that he did and this always amazed me for a long time I wondered why you know if it was me and I had think about this boils from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet so he's having trouble walking right oh said he had him everywhere he couldn't even and so he goes to the ash Heap I'm just thinking is a natural man I would be looking for a creek to get into something cold with some nice you know maybe some mud to get rid of the the problem but job went to the ash sheep did you ever think about what those ashes represented and why did job go there because job knew he had made the sacrifice he knew that he had met God's requirement if you have met God's requirement you have said Lord here am I take my heart who soever calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved that's the word of the Lord to you and he had made that sacrifice over himself over his family his children all of those those things and the the end of the sacrifice if you remember we don't it doesn't really show up until Leviticus but after the sacrifice was all completed the priest would change his garments and take the ashes from the sacrifice outside the gate and they had a special place where they would dump those ashes out job went to the only thing that he had left the only thing that he had left that showed him I have met God's requirement and the only thing sometimes we have left is the word of God that he spoke to us and job laid down in those ashes and in those ashes it said he pickpick picked up a a broken piece of a pot and he began to scrape those sores who is the broken pot it's Jesus Christ and he's scraping his sores with the broken vessel with the ashes that he said I know i' met God's requirement and here is my evidence it's all Jesus Christ friends and so we see this sign and how it's manifested and it's it's the greatest sign and it's not even seen we see the evidence of it that comes forth after the fact if you you want to put it that way you know cuz she here she re the Holy Ghost overshadows her and it brings forth an Evidence in her life that nobody can see and they still couldn't see it until the actual birth came about and then it's like here's this baby and and it's it's a baby and they're looking for a messiah brother brand said that those priests and stuff were looking for the Messiah to come down in a great you know Cloud out of the sky and roll out the carpets and all those things and here it comes forth as a baby it's just a simple child and she's holding it in her arms and wraps it in those swaddling clothes like we talked about the sword last night and she wraps that baby and here is the sign this is the sword of the Lord as a child and how that I stand amazed and how that the Shepherds came and wonder what she thought about that here she's just had this baby and now she's got a house full of company that just not even her house it's a barn and here these people are showing up and you know they want to look at her baby and it's like dude I don't know about you sisters but but what are you guys doing here and I'm just that's the natural side my thoughts on it and how that it was the sign of God for salvation unto Mankind and it was his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and she's holding it in her hands just a little baby you think they could see it as the potential is what it really was no they had to look at it as wow it's just it's just a little kid but because the angel had spoken to them in a certain way they realized you know they went there looking for a potential and they they went wow that's the Messiah and even when they went to have the baby circumcised a blind propheus I believe it was it was the e was what either the prophet or the prophetess well I think it was the prophetes was blind they she was in the temple that day and and here they come with this baby it's only 8 days old and they come down to the temple and as they're they're in the temple the one the the male prophet he God had directed him to the T there's hundreds of people in there and they're getting their babies dedicated and everybody's doing their thing and and this one fellow God arises him by the by the Holy Ghost to go and see to look upon on this child This Little Child because God had had showed him he he said that he would see the Lord's Redemption before he died he was an old man and he held the little child said this is my Redemption just think of the reality of that and yet he knew and he so much that he said let your servant depart in peace because he had seen the potential behind every word spoken in that old Torah concerning the Messiah to Israel and he said okay let your servant depart in in peace I have seen the salvation of our God and here's a blind prophetes brother manam talked about she's feeling her way along the wall and she turns and there's the child never could even see it with her natural eyes but in her heart she knew God had answered the prophecies the life had come to pass in a tiny little vessel what about our vessels we sang that song last night and a lot of people thought I I wrote that song uh let your word be born in in in my heart because I used to always you know sing it in services and but here so here she gets to see this vessel and she gets to see and to understand even she can't see it with her eyes but she perceives it with her heart this is the Salvation of Our Lord this is the life of the prophecy now being manifested for my Redemption wow greatest sign never seen and so we think about it and then when Jesus as he grows and he's growing into those prophecies that were said about him wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father and there's countless prophecies concerning what the life of Jesus Christ would be with his stripes we were healed he hasn't met that one yet but he will and and so he's gone through life and he's you know testifying and he's fulfilling these other scriptures and other his life becomes a fulfillment of scripture that they can look at but they're not they can't really see it and so they're asking they they're Lord we we we know nobody can do these things that you're doing except they be sent from God and Nicodemus when he came to him he said Master nobody can do this stuff unless they're sent from God and and Jesus said you must be born again can't even see it unless you're born again and so these other scribes and Pharisees they're they're going you know this wow this sure looks a lot like we think the Messiah should be but wow where's the where's the red carpet where's all the trumpets where's the uh the troops the the Lord of hosts if you ever you're reading in the Bible sometimes and I'll just drop this in because it becomes important in certain places sometimes it'll say the Lord sometimes it'll say the Lord of hosts sometimes it'll say the Lord thy God and each one of those has a specific life behind it the Lord of hosts is god with his armies because he is the Lord over the host of heaven and it's God with his armies and so they're looking at these things and they're looking at these scriptures because they knew this this was things out of Hebrew out of the the Torah and they're looking at Jesus and going wow he doesn't even have a house to live in a and he just didn't fit the picture they they couldn't see and so they're asking him Lord show us a sign where's the pillar of fire where's the the cloud by day the different things that God had talked about them you know through that Ministry of Moses and through the prophets and all those things and they're saying Lord just give us a sign we'll we we'll catch it but he said a wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign but he said the only sign you're going to get to see is this sign of the Prophet Jonas imagine what they're thought their heads are thinking about that the sign of the Prophet Jonas what are they must have walked away scratching their heads and a little bit confused about things and he just called us a wicked and a generous you know a wicked generation because all we want to see is a sign and so so when we think about this greatest sign that was never seen and they maybe they even went back and you know pulled it out and they're reading about Jonas they're reading about it and they don't understand the life that's in the vessel that's being poured out there is a life in the vessel that's being poured out to them because this is the manifestation of what the word said about their Messiah so let's look at Jonah and there's parts of it that are again easily seen that oh this is Christ he was in the whale belly three days and stuff and Jesus even told us that's what I'm going to be and so but let's go back to where it all starts and that's Jonah the first chapter first verse and watch how God brings the life of Jonah to pass now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amiah saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto tares from the presence of the Lord and he went down to J and found a ship going to tares and he paid the fair thereof and went down to it to go with them unto tares from the presence of the Lord we're familiar with this I think you know all the from Little Sunday school kids on up they can tell you about this part and most people look at Jonah as well that rebellious little twit or whatever word you use it's like what God comes to Jonah go down to Nineveh no man I'm not going forget it it's not my deal that's a bunch of Gentiles and what people don't realize is where God ninev was the capital of the entire Gentile kingdoms of all the kingdoms of the Gentiles at that time and he's telling this Jewish Prophet because it says there in verse 9 when they asked him what are you doing he said oh I'm a Hebrew which actually has a meaning of I am from Beyond or one from Beyond so here is Jonah this Hebrew prophet and and he's I'm not going down there I don't even know their language man why why would I want to go there and so it looks like he's in full Rebellion when he does this and he goes down to tarses because he does not want to go to Nineveh and but where does it start well the word of the Lord the word of the Lord comes to Jonah and behind the word is a life there's water in here that carries life and behind the word there is life in every word that somehow points us to Jesus Christ and so the word of the Lord comes to Jonah and there is a life behind that word and that life that comes to Jonah what's the first thing it says arise and go to Nineveh well Joseph I mean Jonah he gets off probably off his bed or wherever he was sitting or stand and stands up and goes I'm not going forget it no not my deal go find a different Prophet but the word was arise Jonah goes his way and he takes this boat to tarses and when he's kind of caught in his problem and uh they asked ask him you know what's your occupation where do you come from what's your country what people are thou you know they had they were full of questions cuz they're in trouble they're getting bounced around and it looks not too good for anybody and when they get in trouble they go to the Hebrew the one from Beyond and they say to him you know uh who are you and he said I'm a Hebrew and I fear the lord god of Heaven which hath made the Sea and the dry land he knows God made this and if God made this God is probably behind the reason it's being troubled and so he said I I'm I'm you know I believe in Jehovah and when he says this it says they are exceedingly afraid it's like oh man this is not good we've got God's prophet and he's going to the wrong place and we're the ones taking him this is not good and so they asked he why hast thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told them and they said unto him what shall we do with thee that the sea may be calm to us for the sea rod and was temptu and he said unto them take me and cast me up or take me up cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm for you for I know that for my sake this Tempest is is upon you they didn't want to kill him he's a prophet and they have recognized him as a prophet because they were afraid it's like oh Lord what are we going to do and and so they don't want to kill him and it says nevertheless they rode hard to bring him to the land but they couldn't do it for the sea was rot and temptu against him and they Cried unto the Lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this man's life lay not Upon Us innocent blood for thou oh Lord Hast done as it pleased thee and they took Jonah up cast him forth into the sea and the Sea ceased it's raging and his testimony the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offered sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows his running from God converts these guys on the boat because now they're sacrifices it's like oh don't let his blood be on us and it says the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights we understand that testimony but when it says cast him forth into the sea and I I couldn't find the notes where I had written down these uh some of these definitions but one of the if I remember correctly one of the where it says they cast him into the sea it also carries the meaning of like a basin filled with liquid because that's essentially what a sea is It's a Great Basin of land that holds the water within it so now the word of the Lord has come to Jonah and the command was to arise Jonah said I'm not going and now here these things have befallen them but they do as the prophet told them to do cast me into the sea so they cast him into the Basin into this liquid filled Basin greatest sign never seen and it's a part of Jonah that has become an amazing part to me let's look at uh Exodus the 12th chapter we will find what were when Jesus said the only sign you're going to see is the sign of the prophet Jonah well there's more than just Jonah being in the whale's belly for three nights because he's cast into the Basin he's cast into the sea and in Exodus that 12th chapter watch what Jonah's life or the soul the expression of God the nature of God is behind even this little scripture on Jonah in the 12th chapter and about the 22nd verse I think it is uh yes and he's given him Moses here is giving them the Commandments for the the Passover Lamb and in the 21st verse Jonah or Moses calls for the elect Elders of Israel and says unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of hisp and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin that's where it's in the Basin it's in a captured something where they're going to capture the liquid that comes from this lamb and he said and take and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin so what's just happened as they kill this lamb this Passover Lamb this Ram that we know represents the Lamb of God they're going to capture the blood in a basin you're going to dip it in the blood that's in the basin and you're going to strike the lentil in the two side posts with the blood that's in the Basin and none of you shall go out at the door of the house until the morning so what's going on here and we could take this all the way back to Genesis if you want to because he's saying you're going to take this lamb to the door and you're going to slice the the throat on the lamb and you're going to to catch the blood in a basin and from this Basin you're going to go find some hsip which was as we heard in the message you know it's it's just a weed it grows everywhere in Israel and he said it represents just common everyday Faith like the faith that when you get ready to go out of here I hope you all have faith that when you turn that key your car is going to start it takes Faith to do that and that's the kind of faith that God God said that's how you apply the Blood Simple Faith you just believe it and so here they have the Basin and it's laying at the lentil or the opening place of the door who's the door Jesus Christ so here's the blood from the lamb at the lentil of the door and they're to take just common faith and and dip it in this Blood that's laying at the the the door at the threshold of the door and they take from the threshold of the door and they just splatter the blood on the and we know this all represents Christ and they splatter it on the side post of the door and they also were called to Splatter it on the top of the the lentil at the top of the door and we know that if they splatter it there it's going to drip and it's going to make a cross with the blood and so we see it's Jesus Christ and and here it's it's on the lentil but and if you get you know that you can go a whole another Direction with that and it's uh the strong and mighty one is the posts of the door Mel Michael the the Archangel the strong and mighty one as the post of the door and from the threshold to the side post to the lentil it's all by the blood of Jesus Christ who was slain at the threshold you say slain at the threshold when Cain offered as it were the fruit you know it was an excellent sacrifice Bible said it was an excellent sacrifice but it said that Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice why if it was an excellent sacrifice why didn't God accept it and God even told Cain if you don't go back and repent then sin lith at the door at the door what happened Cain's sacrifice was the first fruits an excellent sacrifice but you can't have the first fruits of the Harvest until you've had the death Jesus could not become the first fruits of the Resurrection until he had been slain and Abel had that Revelation there has to be blood slain because my blood has been corrupted through the action of that serpent with his mother that's tough and you get right down to it that's pretty tough but Abel had the right Revelation Cain's Revelation it was an excellent sacrifice but it was out of order you cannot have the first fruits of the Resurrection until there's a death of the blood and that death came when God told him if you go back and repent you know it'll be well but if you don't then sin lieth at the door what is God talking about what's the nature of God behind what he said to Cain the Bible said that Jesus Christ became sin for you and I you understand and he said if you don't go back and repent sin lieth at the door and the lamb was slain at the door and the blood was taken from the Basin to give us that that sign of the cross if you would and the life that was in the lamb is expressed in the blood and we know the life that was in the blood of Christ is expressed unseen to you and I so wow and we see that so the blood was there it was caught in a basin and here Jonah is telling him cast me into the Basin because he has a life in him and that life is arise that was the word to Jonah arise Jonah and go to that crazy bunch of Gentiles can you imagine now just think about this these are Israelis they're I mean they're Jews they're Hebrews and Jesus is telling them the only sign you're going to get is a prophet going to the Gentiles that's what he's telling them because that's what Jonah was was all about arise Jonah and go to the Gentiles you understand can you understand why Israel might have been a little upset with this Prophet named Jesus what the only sign we're going to see is a prophet that gets spit out of the whale and goes to the Gentiles that's what he's telling them hey you bunch of Jews your sign is going to be a a prophet to the Gentiles where we at brother sister you see how it's not only all the way back in the garden now it's in the Deliverance in Exodus and now as it goes through history it comes again at the end time a prophet to the Gentiles what a God we serve what a life behind these words so he's told them cast me into the Basin and we know what happens and he sinks and God has a special fish it says in one place and in another place it calls it a whale and this fish takes up Jonah and it's pretty easy to follow the Life of Christ from that point on and how wow there's another place we'll mention the threshold just because it's another jump in history and that from from the blood in the Basin at the at the threshold that word begins to again move through history and you'll find different places I forgot what word it actually used now and I looked it up earlier today but it means to intertwine well immediately when you see that what do we think of of the crown of thorns because the life was intertwined and placed on the head of Christ and so we think of this word intertwining itself going through history and it comes to down to this Prophet now named Ezekiel and we can read it if you'd like it's the 47th chapter uh of Ezekiel yes I love the word I just I love the Lord Jesus and he said there in 47 verse one afterward he brought me again to the door of the house and behold the waters issued out from under the threshold of the house Eastward how Lord they might think I'm crazy but we're talking about the Seven Seals from the threshold of the door where the lamb was slain where the token was supplied the water begins to issue out from the threshold and it goes to the East and we think about remember the sign to them is the a prophet to the Gentiles and this Prophet comes to the Gentiles and he said now that's that's not brother Bill brand that's the angel of the Lord told you that that was God speaking to you and in one place I just listened to it the other I he said now this might offend you but I I'm the voice of God to you and and he said now I realize some were offended but then he says it again I when he speaks he said I'm the voice of God to you and he said that time I said it under inspiration in other words God told him to tell him that and we had a prophetic message going going going out to the Gentiles out to the Gentiles the blood being expressed the blood being ex stress the token over this message of the hour and it came to a certain place where he went as far west as he could possibly go into the Western Gentile World sunset Mountain and he tell and God tells him now go back to the east to open the Seven Seals go back to the East and from the threshold the water begins to flow to the East and he goes back to the East and he begins to preach the Seven Seals and now he says you have a new book what caused that what caused this water that we're partaking of and the life therein to be revealed to us tonight well as the word of the Lord came to the prophet said go back I have a job for you to do I have something that you ever think about how many times have we heard in the message when brother brandham he'll start into the prayer line and he'll tell people wow your sister so and so you're from such and such a place and uh you know this is your address and whatever it is and one place I remember he talked about he said if people stick around long enough or come he said some people can receive it in immediately this was Christ and they're healed and they walk off the platform but he said if they stick around long enough he said to where he would step into that again and he gave the example of a brother I can't remember what the brother's name was but he said it's like when he would step into that discernment he would look into that person's life from the past and then he would bring it up he said he would step out and that's that's why he would always ask him is that the truth why was that so important to him is that the truth well yeah it's the truth how could they deny it if they denied it they'd have died because it was the truth and then he would step back into the vision and he said and I see you I see you with this doctor you know on a certain certain day and he's told you this and if they could receive it there that's fine and praise the Lord but he said if I step back once more or step into it once more and I can look out into the future and see brother so and so holding a chain or bouncing a baby or a child on his knee he said then I can say thus sayeth the Lord you're healed because this was received by faith in what was said but that is God saying that's the destination of that that man and he would always you've heard I know you've heard these things and he said was well is that the truth is that why was that so important and why was it so important when it comes to the Seven Seals brother he said to preach because that Discerning gift it was so important to him that that never failed because when it came to the Seven Seals and by his own confession he said I went and I started looking up the stuff and he goes I was going to preach it a certain way he said but that angel of the Lord came down and said take a look at it this way now the angel the word of the Lord through an angel Messenger to an angel messenger is now speaking you need to look at this in a a Different Light brother sister he was Discerning the heart of God this time he wasn't Discerning somebody else's heart the angel said look at the word this way and he began to explain oh the first seal is this second seal is this and he comes back and said that's thus sayeth the Lord because now he knows that's a gift that never fails and God has allowed him to look into the heart of God and he comes back and said that's thus sayth the lord well praise the Lord I hope you still love me after tonight I guess it's not too late to change my tickets I don't know do you understand because it's the life behind the word coming forward from Ezekiel coming forward from the blood that was in the Basin coming forth from sin liath at the door Jesus Christ became sin for us and he paid that sacrifice because the sacrifice was the day ye eat thereof ye die and he partook of sin that we could be free from it absolutely free brother brandham gave another example about Sin he said if you took all your sin and you put it in an ey dropper and he said there's a big bucket of bleach I love this and he said you took all of your sin past present future which we could go a whole yeah past present future and you carry that every sin that you'll ever do in that little eye dropper and you drop it into that bucket of bleach he said that bucket of bleach breaks down the chemistry of that ink to where it's as though it never existed your sin in the blood of Jesus Christ never existed and the devil he comes along said I don't believe that stuff man I saw what you did but it's called the bleach blood of the forgetfulness or the it's blotted from the memory of God and but but he knows all things he knows what you did no God can't even remember something that never existed because he's the one that said I exist if you have cast your sins into the blood of Jesus Christ they never existed and not even God will remember them in his memory I hope this sets you free tonight to realize who you are and what hour we're living in and we know that from under that that uh altar there with Ezekiel and I like Ezekiel because he's called son of man several different places God says oh son of man calls calling Ezekiel son of man and how his life started with a vision and so that and when the waters flow out and he starts talking about it you know there's water that you can here's those levels again there's Waters that you can you know up to the ankles or you can weigh out a little deeper and they're up I guess it's the thighs I don't remember what uh you know and then it's the chest and finally he said there's Waters to swim in I hope we're swimming tonight because there's waters for everyone if thou wilst believe and so he that dis with that Discerning gift he discerns the heart of God and reveals to us the whole plan is salvation first seal second seal third seal fourth seal and then you know I I was CH we spoke about this at the house a brother challenged me one time time cuz he said well the seals can't be open because the tribulation not here and was it the fifth or sixth seal one of those was uh tribulation he said they can't be open and as the he had quotes and finally he read a certain quote out of the seals and uh I said Lord I'm just praying as they're cuz they're being very attack full a attack attack full they're attacking me and uh I just said Lord I don't know what to do I don't know what to say you promised that you'd give us to say and the Lord said tell him to read that quote again slowly so I just said brother will you read that once more just real slow and so he starts reading and it's about the Great Tribulation and such and right in the middle of it brother brandham said that's what's happening here tonight the life that's unraveling or going to unravel the G the Great Tribulation was released at that moment that he spoke that seal but just like the word that came to Mary took time to manifest that child so does the life behind the seal that we call the Great Tribulation takes time and what's happened in the last 60 years the whole world's falling apart friends they're over there blasting each other tonight tonight probably over there it's daytime blasting each other to bits preparing and we look at Canada we look at the United States and you look at all the things and and we talk about the the seven visions that were given to brother brandham in 1933 and you know know in in America we just had an election here 3 years ago and and brother brandham said the Democrats would sell their souls for dirty voting machines and that there would be a woman in purple I I I could bring it up how there's actually a Russian brother put together a bunch of these quotes with pictures and the woman that became the vice president because brother bandam said she might be a president president might be vice president she'll be dressed in purple and when they went to be sworn in she was in a purple dress so if and I I don't I can't say that the fullness of The Sixth Seal has been fulfilled but if that was the start friends then there's only one Vision left that'll have to be fulfilled and that's the judgment on he said America he saw ashes and fire over the whole country I'm I'm talking about my own country and what brought the ashes and the fire in the days of Sodom you tell me you understand so what's going to bring the fire to fulfill the seventh seal or the seeven I'm sorry the seventh Vision we know you know and for the sake of this is is going public I won't say it but you know what I'm talking about they think the first six were a fluke I don't think so and neither was the seventh well better finish up with Jonah so let's go back to Jonah and in this particular case like I said it's pretty easy to see the life of Jesus Christ through this part he's been cast into the sea he's in the belly there it says three days three nights it says Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly and he said I cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou he heardest thou heard my voice how did he know God heard him how did he know he couldn't see it he's sitting in the dark I'm thinking he probably probably didn't smell real good in there you know all of his senses are telling me this is insane what am I doing in this fish's belly it's cold it stinks I can't see anything you know it's and yet he said I cried by reason of my Affliction and the Lord heard me he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and he heard my voice Jesus Christ the Bible says in Peter went to hell and preached to the souls in prison out of the belly of hell I cried and God God heard that voice we know Jesus Christ went to hell and preached to those souls in prison and God heard that voice when did he hear the voice Jesus had already prophesied to them that uh tear this Temple down in three days I'll raise it up that was the prophecy he concerned his own life with and laid that in the hands of God and he knew that God heard his voice so we see Jonah being an expression of the life or the soul of God and how that he continues there and he said he cast me into the deep into the midst of the Seas the floods compassed me about the Billows and thy waves passed over me uh and I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple and in verse uh 7 jumping from 4 to 7 he says when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thy Holy Temple and he but he continues there from five the waters compassed me about even to the so the depths closed about me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the Earth with her bars was about me forever yet thou Hast brought up my life from corruption where do we find this word corruption here is Jonah a prophet well after the days of David and yet it was David in the Psalms that said thou wi not leave his soul in Hell nor suffer his holy one to see corruption and here is Jonah using the very prayer that David had spoken in the Psalms concerning and we know it was the life or the soul or the nature of God in David we covered that last night and he from the soul or the nature of God David said you'll not leave his soul in Hell nor suffer the Holy One to see corruption and here is Jonah and he's crying out to God I know he heard my prayer I know that he heard me he has a job to do a Jew a prophet has to go to these Gentiles wow he said you brought up my life from corruption the life of God that was sent into hell is now being brought forth out of corruption why wow and my soul fainted within me when I remembered the Lord his very Soul fainted within him as he thought about the Lord and there's that time frame those two little dots again and he says my prayer came up unto thee into thy Holy Temple and we know that he's in reference there to Solomon where the pillar of fire came came down in the temple and Solomon pronounced the blessing that if any man look towards this Temple but the temple he's really talking about is the temple of God not just necessarily the physic there's a physical aspect and maybe somehow he wiggled around in the whal and thought H my little Compass tells me that's where the the temple is but he said when I looked toward thy Holy Temple by prayer came in unto thee wow there's significance to that little word in also but we another day another time and then he calls in verse 8 they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy this to me is a is a a maybe the highlight of the scripture concerning the sign that it's never seen because Jonah is still in the W's belly probably not having the best time of his life but he realizes that all of this around him is a lying vanity we talk about Rapture and if Jonah is a sign of the Resurrection they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy what's he telling us the nature of God is telling telling me us to look to what the word of God says and not look towards your circumstances don't observe all these lying vanities don't get Carri it away with wow this world that could blow itself all apart by tomorrow morning praise the Lord Brother bradam said we'll be taken into the presence of God I hope we're there tonight because it'll be an easy transition to those who recognize the presence they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy maybe the Lord will take us I I'm not telling you what he's going to take you to tomorrow cuz I don't have a clue but and they that observe vanities forsake their own Mercy but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord so he refuses to recognize the condition that he's in and he's already stated that he believes that God heard his prayer even when he was in the Affliction and as he he uh and now he begins to sacrifice with Thanksgiving even in that condition he's still there he's still in the whale's belly and still stinks still wet cold all those things but he starts to thank the Lord what's he thanking the lord for I will sacrifice unto thee with a voice of Thanksgiving you want to sacrifice to the Lord just tell him thank you it's a sacrifice because of the conditions we live in but he's saying Thank You Lord thank you Lord I'm I I'll go now I'm gonna pay my vow well I'm I'm going to go but Salvation is of the Lord and so we see the next thing and God was pleased with that and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon dry ground but now watch the start of what we call the third chapter and the word of the Lord came unto Jonah a second time saying what's the first word arise and go to Nineveh you see when God said arise clear back at the first that power behind that word was going to bring Jonah out of the fish that he didn't even know he was going to go into the power was in arise and this time when it comes it says arise and go to Nineveh and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee and so he rose and went and we kind of know from there some of the things that happened with Nineveh they repented they say it's because that uh they worshiped the fish in Jonah or or in in that country and at that time period And when Jonah walked out of the fish they went his God is greater than our God which is the fish so when he walks out onto the shore and we don't know if he had time to put a nice suit on or not we don't really don't know I might have been kind of E look at that guy but whatever it was he arose and he came forth out of the fish according to the life behind the word that had spoken to him in the first place was arise and go to Nineveh go to the Gentiles but he could not go to the Gentiles until he had experienced death burial and Resurrection so we see it's all Jesus Christ Christ and after that this Prophet goes to the Gentiles and brings repentance do you love him he's he's all of it you know if I got you know something mixed up that's he pray for me but that's how I see it it's all Jesus Christ and it's all in perfect order according to God's word and we wonder when we talk about well close Lord willing with this because he spoke as it were you know in a way his own Resurrection when he said they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy he's telling us that I'm not going to believe in my surroundings I'm not going to believe in the condition that I'm in I'm not going to believe in any of that but I'm going to praise the Lord oh thank you Jesus and Jesus spit him out where he was supposed to be and so it is with us regardless of what we see our Earthly conditions around us the Earthly condition of these frames that we live in it's all lying vanities and it becomes the life of God that's in that this water that we're drinking tonight will Deliver Us from this world and from these vanities in which we live and how that uh well let's read Luke the 12th chapter excuse me everybody's got stuff going on I guess yes Luke the 12th chapter thank you Lord and sometimes I deliberately deliberately don't Mark in my Bible where stuff is because I want you to be able to catch up so so you can read it and if I just flip to it people are so 12th chapter and the 32nd verse uh he says fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom that's the word of the Lord he is desirous he's it's his pleasure to give give you the kingdom he wants you to have it and in the seventh chapter of Luke in the 21st verse he comes back and he says it like this uh well let's read from the 20th and when he was demanded of the Pharisees now they're getting pretty rough with him hey you think you're Messiah whatever you you they're demanding that he tell them when will the kingdom of God come because they're looking at him and this is nothing like what they're expecting they're expecting their Messiah to be totally different and so they're demanding from him but watch his answer the kingdom of God comes with not not with observation so we're entering the greatest sign the greatest gift the kingdom of God and you can't even see it no observation because the life moves when the water moves the kingdom of God comes without observation and neither shall they say low here or low there for Behold The King kingdom of God is within you I can't see it directly who can but I can see the evidence of it because you're here tonight hopefully you're not angry with me or upset at the word of God just doing my best to speak as he would have us to speak but you can't see it but it's there the kingdom of God is within us and as the last scripture back in Matthew the 12th chapter he gives us another clue to this greatest sign the greatest thing we could desire is to enter into the kingdom of God can't even see it but in Matthew the 12th chapter or the 17 12th chapter I'm sorry got my and in vers 34 and through 37 he says a good man out of The Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned does that make us think about what the third pull really is he said by your words by my words we shall be justified and if we were to go to the Book of Romans he that is Justified is Sanctified and he that is Sanctified is glorified or placed into the kingdom of God that we yet cannot see I'm just telling you what the scripture says it's the greatest sign and it lives in you it lives in me and yet they cannot see it and you know if you want to go to the types and shadows there's an Enoch a guy named Enoch wow just said they looked for him and they couldn't find him where did Enoch go where did Elijah go that's another type I think the Lord just picked him up and spit him down over on those rocks and Elisha says dude you guys are you know in the Spanish mu loo you guys are crazy don't go they said well but we want to okay go ahead and go you understand it's a l life and it's a a kingdom that comes by our words that justify by our confession by our voice of Praise by our voice of Thanksgiving that helped take us into his word into his life that we can enter an unseen Kingdom as Sons and Daughters of God do you love him I love him Lord Jesus we have spoken tonight from your word I had no clue father when we started this service what way you desired to go and the things that you wanted said to this people they are a mature audience or they would not have sat through this and for that I'm grateful it's not often that we get to preach into some of these things that we've channeled into this evening God lead us into this unseen Kingdom lead us by an unseen sign by a new birth where in your life is expressed in Us in such a way that people can see the results of it but the life itself can only be seen by you because it's your life in us I thank you Lord I praise you for this audience I thank you Lord Jesus that our brother Jonathan would have us come and I trust that above in all things and all things we said or did you would receive honor glory and may our love go out to you as your love has been expressed to us through Jesus Christ and through your words whose name we ask it in Jesus name amen praise the lord well as they say sometimes it's it's another one that are it's in the books praise the Lord and uh Lord willing I what time will be back tomorrow morning brother 11 o'clock okay I uh I love the word of God I love the Lord Jesus who delivers to us these words and I know as many we're not always men women we're not we we look at the Flesh and we see the problems and the struggles that we have in this flesh but we know this he overcame the world if you'd like I could do one other song Or Another Song simply because the like I said the sisters were a little upset with me because I haven't been singing but I'm not sure what I did with it here uh well somewhere I had it here I might be able to remember it without the words I like this one because uh my daughter actually helped me write it I said if I can find it and well we'll try it without and if I make a mistake you won't know because we wrote it praise the Lord and sister I'm sorry to bump you from your position but God bless you I enjoyed the song service very much and I was trying to feverishly look a few things up uh but we just love the word of God and the Lord Jesus [Music] wondering out in the dead of night I could not find my way I was lost and torn apart alone and so afraid words of prayer couldn't come comfort me I find no Comfort there became my company and I'm not going to be able to do it huh let me go back and look one more time I think you'll enjoy it I know I I'm sure I brought it out this is the uh flesh part did you that we talked about out the part where we kind of missed the praise the Lord I'm sure I brought that out okay thank you patience is one of those virtues that we were talking about right praise the lord well brother would you mind looking back in the office to see if I left it laying there on the o ah I got it one inside of another yes praise the Lord he has ways of humbling people we just when you think you're going oh man we got this down right no no no no okay praise the Lord like I said this one is special to me cuz my w daughter actually helped write it so okay I better put these other little I got these new peepers they gave us the they put new lenses cuz of cataracts I thought the whole world had turned yellow and brown and if I look at you funny it's cuz I'm wondering what color is that I haven't seen that for a while and everything's so bright so I've even wearing these kind of halfway sunglasses to ah praise the Lord wanding out in the day dark of night I could not find my way I was lost and torn apart alone and so afraid tears became my company I my friends had all withdrawn words of prayer just seemed to fall I found no Comfort there then a lot of voice of friend lifted me somewhere where I've seen his glory in the holy of holies I have seen him face face to face there I found my Rapture by his word in captured I am pardoned by his grace standing in the presence of the king of kings standing in his presence on I am living in his presence standing in his presence I am [Music] changed now I walk much differently child of God I'm found his word reveal inside of me it's Christ my Lord's come down priest the judge the Conqueror the Mighty God is he his glory Reigns with mesty Christ Jesus is the [Music] king wow praise the Lord his glory Reigns lifted by his presence near into eternity where I've seen his glory in the holy of holies I've seen him face to face there I found my Rapture by his word and captured I am pardoned by his grace standing in the presence of of the king of kings standing in his presence I am lifted by his presence standing in his presence I am Chang praise the Lord God bless you thank you can we do that song once more as we get ready to close uh in his time I it's kind of been a special song to me I first time I ever heard it I was in the on the island of maius at brother uh nanded and I went wow that's kind of something to think about that song prayerfully and uh I was actually happy when my daughter who had waited and prayed and prayed you sisters don't think just because you didn't get married at 16 or 17 you're not viable beautiful sisters God bless you and uh there's one there she's in her 40s when she got married and uh this was the song she said Dad I want you to walk me down the aisle singing this song with me because all things are beautiful in his time God bless you this evening I'm you're beautiful beautiful people God bless you I can't he said that's the greatest thing I could say to you so let's just stand and sing it prayerfully to him as the brother comes God bless you in his [Music] Tong in his T beautiful sister he makes all things beautiful every day you're teaching [Music] me you do just what you say in your time drink the life [Music] in he makes all things beautiful in his time Lord please show me [Music] prise the [Music] Lord that you do just what you say in your I trust tonight that these things we talked about were in his time for you there's things we could not have spoken about even a couple of years ago because that life is transitioning from the life of an Angel messenger from the life within the word from the life that's in the message and it's moving moving moving to take us into that unseen Kingdom Glory to God I love you I wouldn't even be here so let's sing it once more as our brother comes in his time God bless everyone of you thank you thank he beautiful in his time Lord please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you'll do just what you say in your [Music] time you know he started with the angel that came to Mary and a messenger came to her and he said the power of the highest shall overshadow thee not a power not some power not a great power he said the that is the only power the power of the highest shall overshadow thee brother BR remember he said this age is the first age he says where the mystery is revealed that you can receive the Holy Ghost without sensation because that is exactly what happened when the first the the the the the second Adam the the the first fruit of us came was he came without sensation there was nothing natural it was completely Supernatural what happened and when you're born of Christ when you're born of the word it is completely Supernatural we're not saying you can't feel something we're saying that what he does is of of him and it is not of man it is not of you it is not your emotion that brings you into a birth it is not a sensation that brings you into birth but it is the almighty power of the highest that brings us into life in this age amen and I it just struck me as he was talking about that how that job went to the ash heap of his sacrifice and said I did my part I did what you told me to do brother brandham says when you've done all that he requires of you you stand there in faith and impatient expectation that he'll do what he said having done all to stand stand you do your part and the word has been released then there's no barriers there's nothing holding it back that'll keep God from fulfilling what he said Allah said you can't have the first fruits of the Harvest unless there's been a death first you can't get the true blessings of God unless there's been a death first you accept his death and burial and resurrection and the and the blood of Calvary and these things but you've got to die to yourself before you can ever get the first fruits of this amen I loved how he talked about the opening of the seals allowed the word to move forward the word is moving the word is always moving but we have a messenger that came and took the the top off the bottle of that word and he said now is the time now is the season we're in the Rapture season and that word went out and it came to a bride and it's Chang ing her and it's washing her by the water of the word and there's a life in it now there's a life in it and there's a people there's a woman to receive the life and now it's producing something and it's the very thing it's the very Christ that went down in the first place but what I love so much about this was when he read that verse eight of Job chapter 2 or Jonah chapter 2 and he says they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy you know what a lying vanity is anything that is contrary to the word of God remember Abraham called those things that were not as though they were to do that you have to call those things that are as though they are not that's right you have to be able to deny what your eyes see what your your mind thinks what you smell what you feel what you hear and say thus sayeth the Lord is what I'm going to focus on Amen If You observe the line vanities if you go by what your five senses say you'll forsake your own Mercy because there's nothing there that's going to save you but if you can go to the word and you can believe the word and you can confess the word then now you've got something that'll take you out of your situation Jonah was in a bad situation but he get he confessed and he testified and he praised God and God took him out of that situation and then what happened is the word had never died the word had never stopped and it said arise again sometimes we arise and we fail but the word keeps saying arise what did it say in the scriptures arise Shine for thy light you've got a light you've got a word you've got a place you got a position I love that I wrote a I put a star in my notes next we glorified means to be placed into the body of Christ because if you're there you can never die you can never fail you can never fall and that's where this word takes you when you arise and you shine your light it's because you're being placed in the body of Christ and you are his word for this day for all men to see amen that was beautiful Brother David I appreciate that let let's testify against these line VES let's sing that song the Healer and we're not just talking about physical healing we're talking about life situations we're talking about family situations we're talking about finances we're talking about mind battles whatever it is you call it a ly vanity and you say Thy word is truth I'll take thus sayeth the Lord over whatever my senses are saying and I'll confess that and I'll testify of that until the day that I see it come to pass in my life because there's a life behind the word and if you'll only stay there it'll come the way he wants it to come in your life amen let's sing this song and we'll turn it over to brother Bob amen I don't like to preach afterwards but I love to speak of the inspiration I get you know there's something about listening to preachers makes you want to preach but I was telling the brothers the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet so I won't preach amen but it was good and we should dwell on these things amen let's sing this you hold my every moment you come my R you are with me through and healed all my disease I trust in you Lord I trust in you I believe
