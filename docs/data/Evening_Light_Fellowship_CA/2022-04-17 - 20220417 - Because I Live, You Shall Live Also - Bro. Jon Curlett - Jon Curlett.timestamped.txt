[36:20] m
[36:50] sheep are funny little creatures in one
[36:52] way here's another thing we might learn
[36:56] of sheep tonight
[36:58] when the weather is real hot
[37:01] did you ever see sheep
[37:04] they won't separate themselves and one
[37:06] be at one place and one another
[37:09] but right in the heat of the day
[37:12] the sheep will all stand together
[37:15] you know what they're doing
[37:17] they're making shades one for the other
[37:21] they're having fellowship
[37:24] and wouldn't it be good if all god's
[37:26] sheep when the heat was all would stand
[37:28] together
[37:29] [Applause]
[37:33] and the trials are real hard and the
[37:36] heat is on
[37:38] and everything going on everywhere if
[37:40] all of god's little sheep would just
[37:43] stand together we'd have the coolness of
[37:46] the shade of each other
[37:49] the comfort
[37:50] to lean upon each other
[37:54] now someone says
[37:56] is that necessary brother branham it
[37:58] certainly is
[38:00] there's nothing like having a real good
[38:04] dependable friend
[38:07] that when the troubles are blazing the
[38:10] heat song
[38:12] you can go to this friend and sit down
[38:16] and just explain it to them
[38:19] talk it over and personal confidence
[38:23] and then kneel down and pray together
[38:27] and know that this person is a good
[38:30] god-saved man or woman
[38:32] that you can put confidence in
[38:35] or it's good to do that
[38:39] come let us reason together saith the
[38:42] scriptures
[38:43] or come let us stand together

[1:05:58] last week we prayed for
[1:06:01] brother and edmonton brother lowell
[1:06:03] beaton uh i've told you about that him
[1:06:06] and i were in
[1:06:08] constant contact
[1:06:09] and he called me last night and he was
[1:06:11] pretty emotional
[1:06:14] if you recall he
[1:06:16] had cancer up here in the cheekbone as i
[1:06:20] was talking about he's got a hole came
[1:06:21] into that
[1:06:23] into that bone
[1:06:24] and it was cancer it's cancerous and he
[1:06:27] had gone to the doctor the doctor said
[1:06:29] look there's only one way we can deal
[1:06:30] with this and he said that is through
[1:06:32] surgery and he had gone through a
[1:06:34] similar surgery in the past he said i'm
[1:06:36] not doing that again and so he told the
[1:06:38] doctor forget it i'm not doing it
[1:06:40] and
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:41] he so he said okay what he said i'll see
[1:06:43] if i can work up some radiation maybe
[1:06:45] that will help
[1:06:46] and
[1:06:48] he said okay well let me know
[1:06:50] and
[1:06:51] that's where it ended and that's where
[1:06:52] we prayed and i know there were a lot of
[1:06:54] other believers praying for him
[1:06:57] so he he called me uh he called me last
[1:07:00] night and he said remember we were
[1:07:01] talking about this last week i said yeah
[1:07:03] i said i've been praying for you and i
[1:07:04] said i brought it to the church and the
[1:07:06] church has been praying for you
[1:07:07] and he said yeah when he said god has
[1:07:10] answered prayer
[1:07:11] and so his story is this that
[1:07:14] he was on the way home a couple of
[1:07:16] nights ago and he's he said they had
[1:07:19] uh he was he was coming home from work
[1:07:21] he stopped at a restaurant to pick up
[1:07:22] some food for him and his wife and while
[1:07:24] he was in the lineup waiting he felt
[1:07:27] something funny in his mouth and he
[1:07:28] wiped his hand over his mouth like that
[1:07:30] and it was all blood
[1:07:32] and
[1:07:34] he got afraid he said what's what's this
[1:07:36] all about so he got out of the lineup
[1:07:38] and he went into the washroom
[1:07:40] and
[1:07:41] he he wiped his mouth again and it was
[1:07:43] all blood
[1:07:45] and uh
[1:07:46] he then he felt something really strange
[1:07:48] in his mouth
[1:07:49] and uh
[1:07:50] he he tugged on it he said it was just
[1:07:52] like flesh
[1:07:54] and he he ended up spitting it into the
[1:07:56] into this into the sink
[1:07:59] and he said it was a four inch long
[1:08:01] piece of flesh by an inch and a half
[1:08:03] wide he figured
[1:08:05] and he said he kept bleeding he flushed
[1:08:07] that down the toilet he kept believing
[1:08:09] he went up and got in his car
[1:08:10] went over to another part of the parking
[1:08:12] lot
[1:08:13] now in the meantime one other one other
[1:08:15] step there that i just remembered is
[1:08:18] that
[1:08:19] he told me last week he said the doctor
[1:08:21] said the pain would would increase and
[1:08:23] he said your pain would be constant and
[1:08:25] it was and he said we got a prayer
[1:08:26] service tonight
[1:08:29] that
[1:08:30] during the week and he said uh he wanted
[1:08:33] to go to the prayer service or should he
[1:08:34] go to the hospital so he went over to
[1:08:36] another part of the parking lot where
[1:08:37] there was no people around
[1:08:38] and he took a glass a bottle of water
[1:08:40] and he just started swishing it around
[1:08:42] and he said
[1:08:45] the bleeding stopped
[1:08:47] and
[1:08:49] he said
[1:08:50] what he noticed was that the pain was
[1:08:51] gone
[1:08:53] and he said
[1:08:55] he said it's gone
[1:08:57] he said i feel 100 better so he went he
[1:09:00] said do i go to the hospital or do i go
[1:09:02] to church for the prayer meeting guess
[1:09:04] what he went to church for the prayer
[1:09:06] meeting
[1:09:07] and
[1:09:08] so
[1:09:10] i said well you know that's an absolute
[1:09:12] miracle because the doctor said we can't
[1:09:14] do anything for you unless you take
[1:09:17] surgery so
[1:09:18] he had cut that off right he said i'm
[1:09:19] not doing it
[1:09:21] so
[1:09:22] so then he sends me a quote he said i
[1:09:24] came across this quote and i i thought
[1:09:26] it was really appropriate
[1:09:28] um
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:30] and this applies to everyone it doesn't
[1:09:31] apply only to cancer in my opinion it's
[1:09:34] this applies to everything that we that
[1:09:37] we
[1:09:37] we go through we suffer through
[1:09:40] here's the quote it comes out of
[1:09:42] awakening jesus it was a 1963 message
[1:09:47] he said let us remember that he created
[1:09:49] our bodies
[1:09:50] he said won't our bodies obey his
[1:09:53] command
[1:09:54] he said spit out that cancer
[1:09:56] he said
[1:09:58] to them he said to the body
[1:10:01] and away it goes he said you just take
[1:10:03] that word and plant it here
[1:10:06] and he said
[1:10:08] see what happens he said
[1:10:10] our bodies have to obey his command
[1:10:14] and that's something
[1:10:16] perfect confirmation
[1:10:19] and i thought you know wow
[1:10:21] we could spit out our arthritis we could
[1:10:24] spit out our headaches and our back back
[1:10:26] problems
[1:10:27] i think because with god in us
[1:10:31] our body has to obey that command
[1:10:34] right it has to go
[1:10:36] that's what happened on calvary right
[1:10:38] that's why jesus went to the cross
[1:10:40] that's why he took those stripes on his
[1:10:42] back brother john made that pretty clear
[1:10:43] the other night
[1:10:45] and that's that's what this is about the
[1:10:47] victory is ours we just got to remember
[1:10:49] that right
[1:10:51] brother branham said in the same message
[1:10:53] he said
[1:10:54] he said we have the authority to talk to
[1:10:56] the devil
[1:10:59] depart get away from me right leave us
[1:11:01] alone
[1:11:02] right
[1:11:04] i thought it was just a real blessing
[1:11:05] and i
[1:11:07] i will hold on to that
[1:11:09] by the grace of god
[1:11:11] amen let's sing it he's ever interceding

[1:28:18] preaching of the word and we trust that
[1:28:20] god will move in the service amen amen
[1:28:23] amen i was up late last night i got not
[1:28:26] feeling so well this morning got quite a
[1:28:27] headache going on we stayed up late
[1:28:29] watching the camp services in louisiana
[1:28:31] and and whatnot and it's a wonderful
[1:28:33] time and we're so thankful for god amen
[1:28:35] moving down there the way that he did
[1:28:37] but we don't want to leave it in
[1:28:39] louisiana camp amen the same god that's
[1:28:41] theirs the same god that's here
[1:28:43] i don't have to be ron spencer or donny
[1:28:45] reagan amen you don't have to be a youth
[1:28:48] all we're looking for is believers that
[1:28:49] will hear the holy spirit speaking and
[1:28:52] act on it amen that's what we're here
[1:28:54] for this morning john 14 and verse 16
[1:28:56] says and i will pray the father and he
[1:28:58] shall give you another comforter that he
[1:29:00] may abide with you forever even the
[1:29:03] spirit of truth whom the world cannot
[1:29:05] receive because it seeth him not neither
[1:29:08] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[1:29:11] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:29:14] and i will not leave you comfortless i
[1:29:17] will come to you yet a little while in
[1:29:19] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[1:29:22] and because i live
[1:29:24] ye shall live also amen may god bless
[1:29:26] his word this morning you may be seated
[1:29:29] i want to take a resurrection title this
[1:29:31] morning of because i live you shall live
[1:29:34] also amen and then setting up this scene
[1:29:37] here in the scriptures we want to
[1:29:38] remember when this was said and this is
[1:29:40] jesus and he's sitting up in the upper
[1:29:42] room and they've they've gone through
[1:29:43] the passover meal and he's already
[1:29:45] washed their feet and he's already told
[1:29:47] judas go and do what you're going to do
[1:29:49] and then he had to clear the room of
[1:29:51] unbelief is what he had to do he had to
[1:29:52] get that man out so jesus could share
[1:29:54] some truth of what's coming down the
[1:29:56] road not only for him but he's also
[1:29:58] sharing the promises of the believer
[1:30:00] with the believers amen and if we go
[1:30:02] back to john 14 and start at verse 12 we
[1:30:05] see that wonderful promise so hold your
[1:30:07] scriptures there if you would in john 14
[1:30:09] because jesus is what we call in the
[1:30:11] vision right now amen he's he he's
[1:30:13] tapped himself into the word he knows
[1:30:15] the events that have to happen and he
[1:30:17] knows that he's got to prepare his
[1:30:18] disciples for what's coming and so he's
[1:30:20] giving them the gospel now before it's
[1:30:22] ever made manifest before they ever know
[1:30:24] the reality of it yet he's giving them
[1:30:26] the good news and that's that i'm not
[1:30:28] going to leave you comfortless i will
[1:30:30] come to you amen and they have no idea
[1:30:32] what that means i i marvel so often that
[1:30:35] that the disciples could have what we
[1:30:36] would call
[1:30:37] plain speech given to them and yet they
[1:30:39] had no understanding of what it meant
[1:30:41] and it reminded me of what brother
[1:30:42] marcus said you know that that it takes
[1:30:44] the the manifestation of the god for you
[1:30:46] to understand what the word of god
[1:30:48] actually meant amen he brings it to pass
[1:30:50] and then he says this is that what i was
[1:30:52] talking about amen so this is the good
[1:30:54] news that jesus is sharing with them and
[1:30:56] in john 14 verse 12 it says verily
[1:30:59] verily i say unto you he that believeth
[1:31:01] on me the works that i do shall he do
[1:31:04] also and greater works than these shall
[1:31:06] he do because i go into my father and we
[1:31:09] read the quote yes on friday night and
[1:31:11] the prophet of god is quick to tell us
[1:31:12] that doesn't mean we're going to do more
[1:31:14] amazing works than jesus christ but he
[1:31:16] says because i'm going because my
[1:31:18] ministry is only three and a half years
[1:31:20] you're going to do more you're going to
[1:31:21] do more by number you're there's there's
[1:31:23] there's dozen of you and then there's
[1:31:25] going to be hundreds and thousands and
[1:31:27] we look even at the ministry of brother
[1:31:28] branham you know over 30 odd years no
[1:31:30] doubt that he had more miracles than
[1:31:32] jesus did we look at some of these these
[1:31:34] uh these campaigns he went through and
[1:31:36] they bring out you know wheelchairs and
[1:31:38] crutches by the truckloads and just
[1:31:41] truckloads of people that were healed
[1:31:42] just walking through these these prayer
[1:31:44] lines and the things that they did so
[1:31:46] jesus ministry was cut short but he says
[1:31:48] my ministry is not going to stop when i
[1:31:50] leave amen but it's going to be evident
[1:31:52] in the lives of the believers because
[1:31:54] you're going to do the same works that i
[1:31:56] do even here amen but the key to this is
[1:31:59] founding in what believing on christ
[1:32:02] amen it is not found just on believing
[1:32:04] in a prophet because he's a
[1:32:05] representation of christ he's bringing
[1:32:07] the word of christ but you have to make
[1:32:08] sure that you're moving into a life with
[1:32:10] christ not just receiving the word of
[1:32:12] malachi 4. because eliezer introduced
[1:32:15] rebecca to isaac amen that's who we were
[1:32:17] supposed to fall in love with so we've
[1:32:19] got to move past that message and let it
[1:32:21] come into us so that we can have a
[1:32:23] relationship with the one that sent the
[1:32:24] message in the first place amen because
[1:32:26] the message was to call a bride to jesus
[1:32:28] christ amen it wasn't just cause her to
[1:32:30] stand up and take notice but it was to
[1:32:32] bring her to her bridegroom this morning
[1:32:35] amen
[1:32:36] amen believing in brother branham won't
[1:32:38] work
[1:32:39] we don't pray to him
[1:32:41] and then believing in a prophet is not
[1:32:43] enough you've got to believe that he was
[1:32:45] a word prophet and you got to see
[1:32:46] yourself in the time that you're in so
[1:32:48] that when he says awake awake the
[1:32:50] bridegroom's coming you wake up and you
[1:32:52] get yourself ready and guess what makes
[1:32:54] you ready the voice of the angel in your
[1:32:56] age that's what's going to get you to
[1:32:57] get ready the right way amen but you've
[1:32:59] got to grow in grace with christ not
[1:33:01] with a prophet
[1:33:02] amen and that's where we see so many
[1:33:04] today especially you know in
[1:33:06] jeffersonville and that is they're
[1:33:07] growing into a relationship with a
[1:33:09] prophet and they're tied to a prophet
[1:33:11] and christ is nowhere in it because
[1:33:12] they're too busy looking at the voice
[1:33:14] rather than the one that was behind the
[1:33:16] voice amen amen but if you truly believe
[1:33:18] in jesus christ then jesus himself says
[1:33:21] the works of christ must come through in
[1:33:23] your life it's not optional but it must
[1:33:25] come through in your life and in verse
[1:33:27] 13 he says and whatsoever you shall ask
[1:33:29] in my name that will i do that the
[1:33:32] father may be glorified in the son so a
[1:33:35] notice of future tense it's coming but
[1:33:37] it's not here yet is what he's saying
[1:33:39] amen be ready look for it
[1:33:41] be an expectation
[1:33:43] and so we want to be an expectation if
[1:33:45] we recognize what's coming our way man
[1:33:47] if you recognize that this is the time
[1:33:49] for something to be fulfilled be an
[1:33:51] expectation for that to be fulfilled
[1:33:53] amen don't put your head in the sand
[1:33:55] don't don't dull your ears but rather be
[1:33:57] ready and waiting and expecting for god
[1:33:59] to move in your situation and in your
[1:34:01] life in the way that he said it but i
[1:34:03] love how jesus says what that the father
[1:34:05] may be glorified when you ask things in
[1:34:08] his name the glory is supposed to go to
[1:34:09] god it's not supposed to go to me it's
[1:34:11] not supposed to go to you but the father
[1:34:13] is supposed to be glorified so it's our
[1:34:16] prayer to raise ourself up there's our
[1:34:17] prayer to raise christ up and keep us
[1:34:19] down where we belong humble at the feet
[1:34:21] of calvary amen
[1:34:23] he says if you love or if you ask
[1:34:25] anything in my name i will do it he's
[1:34:28] pointing to the future he's telling them
[1:34:30] this is coming there's coming a day
[1:34:32] where you're asking my name and i'll do
[1:34:34] anything you ask me amen
[1:34:36] it's an amazing promise and it's not
[1:34:38] just to them it's but to everyone that
[1:34:40] believes and receives the comforter that
[1:34:41] he promised he says if you love me keep
[1:34:44] my commandments and remember jesus said
[1:34:46] it all hinged on two commandments love
[1:34:48] the lord thy god with all thy heart soul
[1:34:50] and mind that's where we start is that
[1:34:52] we place him in the highest place amen
[1:34:55] that he is our worship he is our praise
[1:34:57] he receives the glory out of our lives
[1:34:59] but he says the second one is that you
[1:35:00] love your neighbor as yourself and let
[1:35:03] me tell you if you'll put god first and
[1:35:05] you love your man and the and the woman
[1:35:07] next to you the same way that you love
[1:35:08] yourself you'll come true every time
[1:35:11] because selfishness cannot exist when
[1:35:12] you love god first and you love
[1:35:14] everybody else equally to yourself it
[1:35:16] will take education out it will take
[1:35:17] self-preservation out it will take
[1:35:19] selfishness out and it'll move you into
[1:35:21] a channel where god can use you amen
[1:35:23] what is it when you'll come out every
[1:35:25] time because when you love god and you
[1:35:27] love your neighbor as yourself it kills
[1:35:28] selfishness dead in his track every time
[1:35:30] it kills carnality amen you can't do all
[1:35:33] those things if you're loving god and
[1:35:35] loving the other person as much as
[1:35:36] yourselves amen it's impossible you
[1:35:38] can't even be drawn away by your own
[1:35:40] lusts when you love the person next to
[1:35:42] you when you love your neighbor when you
[1:35:44] love your brother and sister as much as
[1:35:46] yourself because what you're doing is
[1:35:47] you're saying that's lust is for you
[1:35:50] right you can't be drawn of lust when
[1:35:52] you're looking out for the believers
[1:35:53] that are around you amen and you're
[1:35:54] giving first place to god
[1:35:56] verse 16 says and i will pray the father
[1:35:59] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:36:01] that he may abide with you forever
[1:36:03] even the spirit of truth
[1:36:06] we've got a lot of truth floating around
[1:36:07] in the world don't we the spirit of
[1:36:09] truth is not the woke movement is it
[1:36:12] but the spirit of truth catch this is
[1:36:14] not the anti-walk movement either
[1:36:16] right because everybody's there and
[1:36:17] they're trying to say we're right you're
[1:36:19] wrong we're right you're wrong they're
[1:36:20] trying to prove each other wrong and
[1:36:22] that has nothing to do with anything
[1:36:23] amen that's just a movement and an
[1:36:25] anti-movement but the spirit of truth is
[1:36:28] something else him and the spirit of
[1:36:29] truth is a life
[1:36:31] right it is not words it is a life and
[1:36:33] we're sitting there and how many words
[1:36:35] are going out through our lips sometimes
[1:36:37] and it has nothing to do with the spirit
[1:36:39] of truth amen because a spirit is alive
[1:36:42] it is living it is not just the words
[1:36:44] that come out of your mouth amen even
[1:36:47] the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:36:49] cannot receive if the word is receiving
[1:36:51] your message it is not from the spirit
[1:36:53] of truth it cannot be the spirit of
[1:36:55] truth because the world cannot receive
[1:36:58] it because they don't have the spirit
[1:36:59] that you have within you and if your
[1:37:01] spirit is linking up with their spirit
[1:37:03] it is a spirit from hell i will say it
[1:37:07] straight if your spirit is joining with
[1:37:09] their spirit two of you have the wrong
[1:37:10] spirit because the world cannot receive
[1:37:13] the spirit of truth amen because it
[1:37:15] seeth him not neither doesn't know him
[1:37:18] amen but ye know him for he dwelleth
[1:37:20] with you and until he dwells with you
[1:37:22] you don't know him you know him by
[1:37:24] intellect you know him by church
[1:37:26] experience you know him by emotion but
[1:37:28] you do not know him until you see him in
[1:37:31] your life and you say this is that amen
[1:37:34] that this is what he was talking about
[1:37:36] and it is not just in my head and i
[1:37:38] don't move from side to side from day to
[1:37:40] day but this is that which he spoke and
[1:37:42] i'm anchored to eternity amen hallelujah
[1:37:46] amen the spirit of truth will dwell
[1:37:48] within you it is not just in your mouth
[1:37:50] but it is in your everyday life amen
[1:37:53] amen the spirit of truth was right there
[1:37:55] with him it was veiled in jesus christ
[1:37:58] showing the life that they were supposed
[1:37:59] to be living amen
[1:38:01] he says i will not leave you comfortless
[1:38:04] i will come to you that's a personal
[1:38:06] pronoun you can't fit this through the
[1:38:08] trinity because he said the father's
[1:38:09] going to be with you the father's going
[1:38:11] to buy with you forever then he says
[1:38:13] then the spirit of truth is going to
[1:38:14] come which is the holy spirit and then
[1:38:16] he says i'll be with you you've got the
[1:38:18] father holy spirit and jesus christ all
[1:38:20] saying they're going to be there how do
[1:38:21] you fit three into that it's all one in
[1:38:24] the same person isn't it you can't fit
[1:38:26] the trinity through that he says i will
[1:38:28] not leave you comfortless i will come to
[1:38:30] you and yet a little while and the world
[1:38:32] sees me no more why because the corporal
[1:38:35] body's gonna go
[1:38:36] but you see me
[1:38:38] that is ever present you see me now you
[1:38:42] will see me tomorrow and you will see me
[1:38:44] all the way until you leave this earth
[1:38:46] because i live you shall live also
[1:38:50] not there today he's pointed the future
[1:38:53] he says you might think you're alive
[1:38:54] you've had power over demons you've had
[1:38:56] miracles following your ministries maybe
[1:38:58] you've converted people but he says
[1:38:59] you're not even alive yet but you're
[1:39:01] going to be alive at some point amen and
[1:39:03] it's because i live that you're going to
[1:39:06] live as well amen and jesus we have this
[1:39:09] beautiful finish he says because i live
[1:39:11] you shall live also and they had no clue
[1:39:13] what he was talking about i'm sure their
[1:39:16] ears perked up that's amazing
[1:39:18] what is that going to look like what is
[1:39:19] that going to mean
[1:39:21] why don't we have it right now we've
[1:39:23] spent all this time with them we've
[1:39:25] taken the persecution we've been
[1:39:26] associated with them we've had signs and
[1:39:28] wonders following what more could he
[1:39:30] give us
[1:39:32] but we see what happened as as christ
[1:39:34] was going through all of the
[1:39:35] tribulations before he went to the
[1:39:37] crucifixion and they ran away scared
[1:39:39] didn't they they ran away they denied
[1:39:41] him so the life couldn't be there
[1:39:43] because it cannot deny itself he can't
[1:39:45] deny us we can't deny him
[1:39:47] amen
[1:39:48] oh sometimes i wonder if we aren't the
[1:39:50] same way it's so often black and white
[1:39:52] and yet we don't know what's going on
[1:39:55] amen amen
[1:39:57] god interprets his word by bringing it
[1:39:58] to peace and we have the knowledge today
[1:40:01] we have all the knowledge we'll ever
[1:40:02] need
[1:40:03] amen but what we're looking for is a
[1:40:04] word that can come to pass to us by what
[1:40:07] the spirit of truth living inside of us
[1:40:09] amen
[1:40:10] like peter on the day of pentecost he'd
[1:40:12] step out and he'd say this is that which
[1:40:14] was written in joel they didn't know
[1:40:15] what that meant in joel nobody had a
[1:40:18] fulfillment of that in joel and then
[1:40:19] peter comes out and he says this thing
[1:40:21] that you think is us being drunk
[1:40:23] he says this is that what you were
[1:40:25] talking about paul said what the thing
[1:40:27] that is called heresy
[1:40:29] is the thing that is the truth
[1:40:31] right this is that amen but paul would
[1:40:34] do things that nobody else could do why
[1:40:36] because he had found the truth and even
[1:40:38] though they recognized it as heresy he
[1:40:40] said this is the truth and it has an
[1:40:42] effect on my life that i never had while
[1:40:44] i was under the truth reading the
[1:40:46] scrolls i was a pharisee among pharisees
[1:40:48] but until he got the spirit of truth
[1:40:50] inside of him he was dead in his sins
[1:40:51] amen amen amen the prophet of god says
[1:40:54] something about this scripture that just
[1:40:56] brought it to life to me brother brahm
[1:40:58] says this he says all of his teaching
[1:41:00] all of his works
[1:41:02] all of his miracles died with them if he
[1:41:05] didn't raise from the dead
[1:41:07] because what that was to pay a price
[1:41:11] but the thing is after the price is paid
[1:41:13] that doesn't give us the ability to live
[1:41:15] the life that just means the price is
[1:41:17] paid but we can't move forward from
[1:41:19] there you're stuck in limbo your price
[1:41:21] is paid he doesn't see any sin but you
[1:41:23] can't overcome
[1:41:25] amen he says what but if he's risen from
[1:41:28] the dead friends you people will see
[1:41:30] someday that the very chief cornerstone
[1:41:32] has been rejected by the builders that's
[1:41:34] right jesus has risen from the dead and
[1:41:37] if he's here tonight he can do just the
[1:41:39] same he works through people
[1:41:42] do you want him to work through you
[1:41:44] he says now he can't unless you believe
[1:41:47] a minister said to me said brother
[1:41:49] branham i don't care what would take
[1:41:50] place i wouldn't believe it i said it's
[1:41:54] not for unbelievers it's for believers
[1:41:57] amen
[1:41:58] what did paul say he said if after the
[1:42:00] first or second admonition they don't
[1:42:02] take it reject he says don't waste your
[1:42:04] time
[1:42:05] move on to the next one because maybe
[1:42:07] the next one will he says they didn't
[1:42:09] believe jesus and they surely won't
[1:42:11] believe a servant can you imagine jesus
[1:42:12] is walking through nain and they've got
[1:42:14] a funeral procession and he walks up and
[1:42:16] he raises a man from the dead he goes to
[1:42:19] lazarus and raises him from the dead
[1:42:20] though he's been dead for three four
[1:42:22] days raises him up out of the tomb and
[1:42:25] yet they still could not believe that
[1:42:26] that was god in flesh they couldn't
[1:42:27] believe it was the true messiah so
[1:42:29] brother rahm says if they won't believe
[1:42:30] that then how are they ever going to
[1:42:32] believe you unless the spirit of god is
[1:42:34] in them to be quickened in the first
[1:42:35] place
[1:42:36] he says see these signs shall follow
[1:42:38] them that believe not unbelievers
[1:42:41] believers what did jesus say these signs
[1:42:44] shall follow them that believe the test
[1:42:46] for the ages will you believe what is
[1:42:48] brought to you
[1:42:50] and then will you act on it
[1:42:52] not just say it in your head but belief
[1:42:54] did what did james say show me your
[1:42:56] faith by your works
[1:43:00] if your faith doesn't bring any works
[1:43:02] with it it's dead
[1:43:03] right so you've got to act on what you
[1:43:05] believe so the thing is we are not to
[1:43:07] say amen
[1:43:09] only but we are to be amen amen because
[1:43:13] when you say amen you're saying so be it
[1:43:15] in me so you're not just saying now amen
[1:43:17] brother john amen brother jail amen
[1:43:19] brother mark amen brother ron amen
[1:43:21] brother donny but you're saying be in me
[1:43:23] what he's saying is what you're saying
[1:43:25] when you raise your hands and say amen
[1:43:26] right you're saying let it be in me not
[1:43:28] just in my brother not just in my sister
[1:43:30] but amen is for me amen let me live out
[1:43:33] the word let me live by the word let me
[1:43:35] live through the word let me reflect the
[1:43:37] word
[1:43:39] talk is cheap anybody can sit here and
[1:43:41] say amen anybody can sit under the
[1:43:43] hearing of the word of god and say that
[1:43:45] sounds good amen but i've learned a long
[1:43:47] time ago that those that talk a lot
[1:43:49] rarely walk the walk because what
[1:43:53] remember what james talked about the
[1:43:54] tongue he says a man that can't bridle
[1:43:56] it his religion is vain
[1:43:58] right when all you can do is talk
[1:44:00] you can't hear
[1:44:02] and so often today silences they say
[1:44:04] silence is golden and you know what it
[1:44:06] takes to be quiet to recognize that
[1:44:08] somebody else has something more worthy
[1:44:10] to say than you do
[1:44:11] and then when you meet god you'll
[1:44:13] realize that you bring nothing to the
[1:44:14] table when it comes to words
[1:44:16] amen you bring nothing to the table in
[1:44:19] terms of wisdom in terms of bringing
[1:44:21] people to a reality amen when you walk
[1:44:23] the walk it has a way of humbling you
[1:44:25] it has to humble you amen brother braham
[1:44:28] said humility is power with god and how
[1:44:29] are you going to move on into the power
[1:44:30] of god if you lack humility amen i've
[1:44:33] had to learn that so many times the hard
[1:44:35] way and i'm still learning today man but
[1:44:37] if there's anything the word does to a
[1:44:38] believer is it humbles you
[1:44:40] amen that's the first thing he's got to
[1:44:42] do because you've got to humble yourself
[1:44:43] and repent how can you repent if you
[1:44:46] don't think you're wrong right that's
[1:44:47] the first humbling is repentance because
[1:44:49] i've lived the wrong way thinking or
[1:44:52] wanting to do that way
[1:44:53] amen
[1:44:54] what is it the greater the influence and
[1:44:56] control of the word in your life the
[1:44:58] more you realize how truly insignificant
[1:45:00] you are compared to him
[1:45:02] in your flesh
[1:45:04] in your flesh right does anyone anyone
[1:45:06] go up to god and give him advice
[1:45:10] anybody done that recently
[1:45:13] no
[1:45:14] sometimes we do when we tell them how to
[1:45:15] answer our prayers but we don't go up
[1:45:17] and say god you know and in this
[1:45:19] situation i feel you should really do
[1:45:21] this
[1:45:22] how arrogant will we consider ourselves
[1:45:24] if we did that
[1:45:25] but yet we talk all the time
[1:45:27] and many times what we're doing is we're
[1:45:29] keeping him from speaking and flowing
[1:45:30] through our life amen
[1:45:32] you realize that very quickly as a
[1:45:33] believer you can't do what you need to
[1:45:35] do in this life and so you need to be
[1:45:37] quiet and let him do the talking in it
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:39] but jesus promised that he would rise
[1:45:41] again and in that resurrection the true
[1:45:43] church would live by the very same life
[1:45:45] that he lived his life by and the life
[1:45:47] that he continues to live his life by
[1:45:49] amen but the life of christ had to cross
[1:45:52] over to us and this is where we get into
[1:45:53] where brother mark was trampling all
[1:45:55] over the sermon amen as brother mark
[1:45:57] pointed out the blood of an animal
[1:45:58] couldn't pay the price because the blood
[1:46:00] of an animal doesn't carry the life of a
[1:46:02] human
[1:46:03] that's why it was no good it could cover
[1:46:06] for a year but it could not pay the
[1:46:08] price and more importantly that life
[1:46:10] could not transfer to us that was the
[1:46:12] purpose of death was that life could
[1:46:13] come to the one that received the price
[1:46:15] paid amen
[1:46:16] but when christ died he was human just
[1:46:18] like us and so the the blood the the
[1:46:20] life of the blood could cross over in
[1:46:22] john 19 33 it says but when they came to
[1:46:25] jesus and saw that he was dead already
[1:46:27] they break not his legs but one of the
[1:46:30] soldiers with a spear pierced his side
[1:46:32] and forthwith came out there blood and
[1:46:34] water
[1:46:35] so there's only in debt that life can be
[1:46:37] transferred when it comes to sin if the
[1:46:39] sacrifice doesn't die then there's no
[1:46:41] transference of life there can't be
[1:46:42] right one has to die that another can't
[1:46:45] live but this wasn't a blood covering
[1:46:47] only now amen this was a price paid
[1:46:50] forever because the lamb that was killed
[1:46:53] the bulls that were killed the turtle
[1:46:54] doves and these different things they
[1:46:56] were just taking our place temporarily
[1:46:58] but when a light for like sacrifice is
[1:47:00] made then the price is paid forever if
[1:47:03] it's a worthy sacrifice and we know of
[1:47:05] course that christ was a worthy
[1:47:06] sacrifice and so it would erase the debt
[1:47:08] forever erase the debt forever
[1:47:10] past present and future when he died he
[1:47:13] erased all sin
[1:47:14] that was it the price was paid and all
[1:47:16] that's left for us to do is to accept it
[1:47:18] amen the record doesn't even exist
[1:47:21] that's how that's how complete this was
[1:47:23] was the record didn't doesn't even exist
[1:47:25] when they covered it with the blood of a
[1:47:27] land for 4 000 years all they did was
[1:47:29] they kicked the sim bucket down the road
[1:47:31] and the bucket kept getting bigger and
[1:47:33] bigger and bigger and bigger it never
[1:47:35] resolved it it just kept moving it down
[1:47:37] the road amen
[1:47:39] amen so you say as we said last service
[1:47:42] god can do anything god can't remember
[1:47:43] your sins that are under the blood of
[1:47:45] christ amen he can't remember them
[1:47:48] because they don't even exist that's how
[1:47:50] complete the blood of christ works amen
[1:47:54] so when you talk to him
[1:47:55] and say i did it again lord i'm sorry he
[1:47:58] says did what again
[1:48:00] well i did such and such he says you've
[1:48:01] never done that before
[1:48:03] yeah i did i did it last week no no you
[1:48:06] didn't what are you talking about
[1:48:08] he can't remember it
[1:48:10] the god that knows all things can't
[1:48:12] remember your sin when it's under the
[1:48:14] blood so don't remind him about it
[1:48:16] put it under the blood and move on don't
[1:48:18] remind him of your brother or sister's
[1:48:20] sins either because they're supposed to
[1:48:21] be under the blood as well amen if we
[1:48:23] can put it that way
[1:48:24] amen can you imagine though the
[1:48:26] frustration of satan because satan under
[1:48:28] the blood of bulls and goats he can go
[1:48:30] before christ he can go before god and
[1:48:32] he can what accuse the brethren
[1:48:35] because there's only a covering there
[1:48:37] god knows there's sin under there
[1:48:39] but he can't do anything about it but
[1:48:41] satan can remind him and god can't check
[1:48:43] him from that god can just say the price
[1:48:45] has been paid there there's a covering
[1:48:47] for it so i'm not going to do anything
[1:48:48] and satan can keep saying well he did
[1:48:50] this and she did that and god says they
[1:48:52] did but the blood covers it so i'm not
[1:48:54] going to do anything about it but when
[1:48:55] christ died now satan comes up and he
[1:48:58] says brother john did such and such and
[1:49:00] and christ and god says
[1:49:02] no he didn't
[1:49:04] yes he did i saw him with my own eyes no
[1:49:07] he didn't do it
[1:49:08] what do you talk about i have video of
[1:49:10] it no he didn't do it check your video
[1:49:12] he looks at the video there's nothing on
[1:49:14] it why because the blood of jesus christ
[1:49:16] cleanses us from all sin it doesn't just
[1:49:18] cover it wipes it away and we stand
[1:49:20] spotless in christ righteousness amen
[1:49:22] satan is getting so frustrated because
[1:49:24] he keeps trying to remind god of our
[1:49:26] sins and there's nothing there
[1:49:28] he has no proof
[1:49:29] and if there's no proof then there can
[1:49:31] be no penalty amen why when god looks at
[1:49:33] us all he sees is the righteousness of
[1:49:35] christ we are sinless perfect right now
[1:49:38] in the eyes of god
[1:49:40] amen we go to what brother mark was
[1:49:43] talking about on the new birth and
[1:49:44] nicodemus in john 3 3 says jesus
[1:49:46] answered and said unto him verily verily
[1:49:48] i say unto thee except a man be born
[1:49:50] again he cannot see the kingdom of god
[1:49:52] nicodemus saith unto him how can a man
[1:49:54] be born when he is old can he enter the
[1:49:57] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:49:58] be born jesus answered verily verily i
[1:50:01] say unto thee except a man be born of
[1:50:04] water and of spirit he cannot enter the
[1:50:07] kingdom of god now we know the new birth
[1:50:09] requires two things water and spirit to
[1:50:11] be the new deal you can't just have one
[1:50:13] and you can't just have the other and
[1:50:15] you can't get one without the other
[1:50:16] either if i could put it that way you
[1:50:18] can't get the spirit unless you go
[1:50:19] through water baptism amen there's a
[1:50:21] process for going through these things
[1:50:23] amen remember we're preaching on because
[1:50:25] i live you shall live also amen and that
[1:50:27] means the source of life that we're
[1:50:28] living by has to be the same as his
[1:50:31] right as brother brahm said if he isn't
[1:50:33] alive we wouldn't be alive either as
[1:50:35] believers we couldn't live as believers
[1:50:38] right we'd be flawed humans we'd stay as
[1:50:40] flat humans but now we've got a life
[1:50:41] that allows us to overcome things that
[1:50:43] they could never
[1:50:44] overcome before
[1:50:45] but says when jesus died at calvary what
[1:50:48] elements came from his body water blood
[1:50:51] spirit is that right now any minister
[1:50:53] any believer knows that that's what
[1:50:54] constitutes the new birth is that right
[1:50:56] that constitutes a new birth saint john
[1:50:59] first john 5 7 there are three that bear
[1:51:01] record of water blood and spirit and
[1:51:03] when they pierced aside water and blood
[1:51:05] came forth came out and he said into thy
[1:51:08] hands i commit my spirit he put it for
[1:51:10] safe keeping in the hands of the father
[1:51:12] those elements went from his body and it
[1:51:15] takes those same elements to bring you
[1:51:17] to his body that constitutes the new
[1:51:20] birth now we just read where john 3 says
[1:51:23] that he's got to be born of water and
[1:51:24] spirit but then brother brown says but
[1:51:26] there's got to be blood as well
[1:51:28] scripture doesn't say blood but what
[1:51:30] part does blood have in the new birth
[1:51:32] the new the the blood makes a way where
[1:51:35] there was no way
[1:51:36] right
[1:51:37] and then it covers everything that you
[1:51:39] do
[1:51:40] right but it makes a way where there was
[1:51:41] no way it's the open door that we needed
[1:51:43] was that blood that made access now to a
[1:51:46] place where we could what receive repent
[1:51:48] and receive the very life of christ amen
[1:51:51] the blood pays the price the blood is
[1:51:53] the redemptive token
[1:51:55] amen when you remember in goshen what
[1:51:56] did he say when i see the blood i will
[1:52:00] pass over you that was the redemptive
[1:52:02] token that was what took your place amen
[1:52:04] you were already judged in christ at
[1:52:06] calvary and now you stand perfect
[1:52:08] unblemished with his righteousness as
[1:52:09] your covering
[1:52:10] that's it so don't beat yourself up
[1:52:12] about what you do amen you have a
[1:52:14] besetting sin you've got something that
[1:52:16] keeps messing you up then you go to god
[1:52:17] and you say god burn that out of me as
[1:52:19] we talked about last summer burn it out
[1:52:21] with your love let me fall so in love
[1:52:23] with you brother ron spencer that's what
[1:52:24] he he tells people he says they want to
[1:52:26] get closer to god he says fall in love
[1:52:28] with jesus amen let the love of god
[1:52:31] overcome any other loves that you have
[1:52:33] in your body that's when you put him
[1:52:34] first in your life is when you love him
[1:52:36] above all else and though this flesh
[1:52:38] might love many things that are
[1:52:39] completely unholy yet the spirit that's
[1:52:41] inside you wills you pass it says but i
[1:52:43] love him more amen and so i will not do
[1:52:45] those things amen but the life is in the
[1:52:47] blood that's what the blood has to do
[1:52:49] with it is the life that you're going to
[1:52:51] receive through his spirit comes through
[1:52:52] the blood so without the blood you have
[1:52:54] no holy spirit you have no life amen i
[1:52:57] can lose a lot of things i can lose
[1:52:58] limbs i can lose organs if i lose blood
[1:53:01] i can't live amen i can get things
[1:53:04] amputated off me i can have surgery to
[1:53:05] remove things that most would consider
[1:53:07] essential and they can keep me alive but
[1:53:08] if i lose my blood i'm dead amen the
[1:53:11] life is in the blood and that's what
[1:53:12] they did at calvary is they pierced his
[1:53:14] side so that the blood could drain out
[1:53:15] and that was representing the life that
[1:53:17] would go out and be available to the
[1:53:19] believers amen
[1:53:21] and the old testament when a man sinned
[1:53:22] he put his head on the sacrifice as they
[1:53:25] killed it he put his hand on the head of
[1:53:27] the bull as they slit the throat and
[1:53:29] drained the blood out and that was
[1:53:30] identifying with his sacrifice
[1:53:33] i'm sure that was a somber moment
[1:53:35] i i don't know
[1:53:36] anybody that really loves to see things
[1:53:38] killed
[1:53:40] but when you walk up and you have a
[1:53:42] perfect animal there that's never done
[1:53:44] anything wrong to hurt you and you lay
[1:53:46] your hands on as they cut the throat and
[1:53:47] the blood comes out that had to be a
[1:53:49] sobering moment and i'll bet you for a
[1:53:50] couple weeks after that they were really
[1:53:52] good christians you know if i can put it
[1:53:54] that way but then what happened they
[1:53:56] fell back into their old way of life
[1:53:57] didn't they because there was no life
[1:53:59] coming from that blood it was guilt that
[1:54:01] kept them pure for a while
[1:54:03] guilt is not the way god keeps us pure
[1:54:05] brothers and sisters guilt is the way
[1:54:07] satan tries to mess us up amen but god
[1:54:09] gives us always a place of remedy for
[1:54:11] these things
[1:54:12] but when christ died something else
[1:54:14] happened brother braham says a man put
[1:54:16] his hand on the head of jesus christ and
[1:54:18] confess his son feeling the pains and
[1:54:21] agony of calgary
[1:54:23] we don't get to feel it we can only
[1:54:24] imagine it in our head
[1:54:26] but he says when you put your hands on
[1:54:27] his head as he's dying what sin what he
[1:54:30] had to pay to redeem a man from sin and
[1:54:33] the holy spirit out of the blood of
[1:54:35] jesus christ comes cleansing that man he
[1:54:39] goes out a new creature and it's once
[1:54:42] for all he goes out a different person
[1:54:44] he goes out with all the sin problems
[1:54:46] settled forever for by one sacrifice
[1:54:49] says the scripture here he has perfected
[1:54:51] forever them that are sanctified and he
[1:54:53] said the holy ghost bears record of the
[1:54:55] same so david and joseph and moses and
[1:54:58] and joshua they never got to experience
[1:55:00] the new birth what they got to
[1:55:02] experience was an anointing upon them to
[1:55:04] do a job
[1:55:05] but they did not experience the new
[1:55:07] birth like you and i have it amen they
[1:55:09] were anointed but they never changed
[1:55:13] how powerful was that anointing to make
[1:55:15] them live the lives that they did and
[1:55:17] they don't even have what we have access
[1:55:19] to today which is the holy spirit on the
[1:55:20] innermost being
[1:55:22] what's our excuse if they can do that
[1:55:24] with a simple anointing on them what are
[1:55:26] we to be able to do with an anointing in
[1:55:28] us of the eternal god amen what's
[1:55:30] holding us back it certainly isn't
[1:55:31] what's inside of us amen something else
[1:55:34] has to give amen they were anointed with
[1:55:36] purpose and they surrendered to it
[1:55:38] and that's all god's asking us to do
[1:55:40] it's the same thing
[1:55:41] surrender to the anointing that is
[1:55:42] within you amen
[1:55:44] amen but the price was paid there
[1:55:48] but now what the price is paid like i
[1:55:50] said you stand in limbo if there's no
[1:55:51] new life you stand there a sinner
[1:55:53] forgive him but you're still going to
[1:55:54] keep going on with the same desires and
[1:55:56] the same wills and the same issues in
[1:55:58] your carnality that you have before amen
[1:56:00] we have to be born of water and spirit
[1:56:02] bubram says now you see his secret what
[1:56:05] too to restore fallen eve as she was a
[1:56:08] prefigure of the church and now notice
[1:56:11] as god opened up the side of adam and
[1:56:13] took out eve by his own flesh and blood
[1:56:15] and divided his spirit from masculine
[1:56:17] and feminist to feminist to put it in
[1:56:19] eve he took the rib from under his side
[1:56:21] and made eve out of it so god did the
[1:56:23] same thing taking out of the side of
[1:56:25] christ the blood in the water and christ
[1:56:28] is the word and taking the word and
[1:56:30] making up his church eve see he's back
[1:56:33] to himself again redeemed by the blood
[1:56:35] that was come from his body you see it
[1:56:37] now so
[1:56:39] you can picture satan sitting there
[1:56:40] gleefully and remember satan had the
[1:56:43] keys to death in hell
[1:56:44] right and so he sees jesus on the cross
[1:56:47] and satan's just sitting there saying
[1:56:48] it's just about time
[1:56:50] just about time i'm going to get him now
[1:56:52] he's beating me all the way but he can't
[1:56:55] beat death because he's saying nobody's
[1:56:57] ever beaten death
[1:56:58] once it touched them we had enoch go we
[1:57:01] had elijah go but death never touched
[1:57:03] him but he says he's staying there and
[1:57:04] i'm going to touch him with death
[1:57:06] and he's saying i'm going to finally win
[1:57:08] i can finally beat this guy and you know
[1:57:10] what jesus is doing he's saying come in
[1:57:12] a little closer come on come on you can
[1:57:15] do it you can do it and what's he doing
[1:57:17] he's setting a trap
[1:57:19] he's saying sting me once
[1:57:21] just do it just do it oh make it make
[1:57:24] yourself think you're gonna win sting me
[1:57:27] sting me come on do it that's what's in
[1:57:29] his head sting me give it to me give it
[1:57:30] to me give it to me because he knows as
[1:57:32] we read on friday if he sticks it in
[1:57:34] there he's never getting that stinger
[1:57:35] back again amen satan is walking into a
[1:57:38] trap amen
[1:57:39] amen what is it satan's satan couldn't
[1:57:42] have stopped himself even if he knew
[1:57:43] what was going to happen because satan's
[1:57:45] anointing is to steal kill and destroy
[1:57:48] and so if he sees an opportunity to
[1:57:49] steal kill and destroy he's going to do
[1:57:51] it regardless of whether or not if he
[1:57:52] stopped to think he'd say that might not
[1:57:54] be the best idea amen look what it did
[1:57:56] to job he steal stole killed and
[1:57:58] destroyed job's life and what did it do
[1:58:00] gave job a resurrection and then he had
[1:58:02] more than he ever had before after that
[1:58:04] amen game of revelation that surpassed
[1:58:06] anything that job could could hold on to
[1:58:08] in this world amen
[1:58:09] amen he's claimed a life there but he
[1:58:11] couldn't hold it and the keys went right
[1:58:13] out of his belt and into those of christ
[1:58:15] amen and that's why we have resurrection
[1:58:17] life today is because he he drew satan
[1:58:19] in he said come on sting me and then
[1:58:22] satan couldn't sting anybody else
[1:58:23] anymore
[1:58:24] but listen to this he says when the
[1:58:26] blood cell was broke
[1:58:28] in jesus christ
[1:58:30] god was released
[1:58:33] god was released that's what happened
[1:58:35] there he said see he was god that blood
[1:58:37] wasn't jewish that blood wasn't gentile
[1:58:39] that was a creative blood cell god
[1:58:42] himself and now through that blood
[1:58:44] making a propitiation for our sins he
[1:58:46] cleanses a believer takes all of his
[1:58:48] sins away from him as if he never had
[1:58:51] sin god puts them in the sea of
[1:58:52] forgetfulness and the same god that was
[1:58:55] upon jesus christ continues in the
[1:58:58] believer doing the same works that he
[1:59:00] did here for it's the same spirit amen
[1:59:04] amen you've got to come by water and
[1:59:06] spirit acts 2 peter says this now when
[1:59:08] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:59:09] their heart and they said to peter and
[1:59:11] the rest of the apostles men and
[1:59:12] brethren what shall we do then peter
[1:59:15] said unto them repent and be baptized
[1:59:17] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:59:18] christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:59:21] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:59:23] be baptized that's water
[1:59:26] right you've got to be born of water and
[1:59:28] of spirit amen you've got to be the
[1:59:30] first thing in the birth is always water
[1:59:32] amen the water breaks inside the mother
[1:59:34] and then you know something's going to
[1:59:36] happen from there until the water breaks
[1:59:37] it's not coming
[1:59:38] you can you can be two weeks past your
[1:59:40] due date but until that water breaks
[1:59:42] nothing's going to happen amen
[1:59:44] so what you've got to be baptized in
[1:59:46] water in the name of jesus christ peter
[1:59:48] tells us not titles and in the name but
[1:59:50] what leads you to the water in the first
[1:59:51] place why don't you go sign your name on
[1:59:53] a church roster why don't you just raise
[1:59:55] your hand and say the prayer sinner's
[1:59:57] prayer why do you go to the water
[1:59:59] because the word tells you to
[2:00:01] amen and that's the first water that
[2:00:03] ever touches you is the washing of water
[2:00:05] of the word amen the word tells you to
[2:00:07] go to the water the word tells you to do
[2:00:09] what you're supposed to do the word
[2:00:10] quickens you to walk the way that will
[2:00:12] bring you into newness of life and then
[2:00:14] the first act of the word of the god is
[2:00:16] to get you to where god can do something
[2:00:18] with you so he's got to wash you clean
[2:00:20] amen he's got to get you dying out and
[2:00:22] the first dine out is to yourself before
[2:00:24] you go down and baptism amen
[2:00:26] the old man has to die and the first
[2:00:28] work of the word is to get you dead so
[2:00:30] christ can live in you now the thing is
[2:00:32] you go down to that water and it's
[2:00:34] figurative when you come up
[2:00:38] did does jonathan curlette change in and
[2:00:40] of himself does his flesh change no this
[2:00:43] flesh comes up just wet
[2:00:45] but the inner man has been changed and
[2:00:47] it doesn't matter if i feel it or don't
[2:00:49] feel it
[2:00:50] it's changed because i've obeyed the
[2:00:52] word amen and he's cleansed me from that
[2:00:54] but after that what is it god does a
[2:00:56] progressive work of killing jonathan
[2:00:58] corlett all the way until we go into a
[2:01:00] rapture amen or resurrection as as it
[2:01:02] might be amen in ephesians 5 he says
[2:01:05] husbands love your wives even as christ
[2:01:07] also loved the church and gave himself
[2:01:09] for it that he might sanctify and
[2:01:11] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[2:01:13] the word
[2:01:15] so it's not just a washing of water in
[2:01:17] baptism but it is a continual washing of
[2:01:19] the believer by the word
[2:01:21] with what purpose that he might
[2:01:23] presented to himself a glorious church
[2:01:25] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[2:01:27] thing but that it should be holy and
[2:01:29] without blemish
[2:01:31] because what the spirit has to come into
[2:01:33] something that's clean for service if
[2:01:35] it's full of filth then the spirit can't
[2:01:36] work there amen but that washing of
[2:01:38] water by the word is a sanctification
[2:01:41] process that makes you fit for service
[2:01:44] and this is happening constantly and as
[2:01:45] i said on friday sanctification doesn't
[2:01:47] always mean getting out bad things
[2:01:49] that's initial that's what starts in the
[2:01:51] beginning you get rid of the books and
[2:01:53] you get rid of the alcohol and the and
[2:01:55] the smoking and the drugs and
[2:01:57] you know living you know common law
[2:01:58] whatever that might be
[2:02:00] and that's making you fit for service
[2:02:02] but then what happens is you still have
[2:02:04] things in that cup and what he's doing
[2:02:06] is he's shaving out more of that so he
[2:02:08] can put more of him in and that's what
[2:02:09] sanctification is oftentimes is it's
[2:02:11] cutting out bits of you that neither
[2:02:13] good nor bad if i could put it that way
[2:02:15] not that there maybe is such a thing but
[2:02:16] you know it might be hobbies it might be
[2:02:19] things we focus on and whatnot and he
[2:02:20] says that's got to go because i need
[2:02:22] more of you
[2:02:23] i need more of you and so that means
[2:02:25] something in you's got to go jonathan
[2:02:26] curlett right and that's all he's doing
[2:02:28] is he's cutting out more of the things
[2:02:30] in my life that have nothing that are
[2:02:31] that are for his good
[2:02:33] amen water and spirit
[2:02:35] amen how many people are sitting in
[2:02:37] church today and they've got the water
[2:02:38] part down and they think they're going
[2:02:39] to heaven
[2:02:41] that's not it
[2:02:42] that's the start of it amen
[2:02:45] what you must be born again you've got
[2:02:47] to have the spirit you've got to have
[2:02:48] the token life amen you've got to have
[2:02:50] the proof that god has recognized your
[2:02:52] repentance amen that you actually have
[2:02:54] repented if you've if you've gone and
[2:02:57] you've gotten baptized and you've
[2:02:58] repented and you don't have the holy
[2:02:59] ghost then the only thing that's holding
[2:03:00] it back is you're asking for it
[2:03:02] if it's a true repentance the only thing
[2:03:04] that's waiting is is for god to say he's
[2:03:06] serious enough or she's serious enough
[2:03:07] and she wants it and now they're going
[2:03:09] to get it that's all there is it's
[2:03:11] always if your repentance is true amen
[2:03:13] but the word never stops washing
[2:03:15] ephesians 5 26 this is a constant
[2:03:18] washing amen i think every believer in
[2:03:19] here could raise their head and say i'm
[2:03:20] still being washed by the water of the
[2:03:22] word that's why we come to church isn't
[2:03:24] it that's why we listen to services it's
[2:03:25] why we read our bibles it's why we pray
[2:03:27] is so that the word can come in and wash
[2:03:29] us and give us a new mind and give us a
[2:03:31] new perspective and quicken the faith
[2:03:33] quicken the very life of god that's
[2:03:34] inside of us amen what is it it keeps
[2:03:36] you clean so that when you go down to
[2:03:38] pray you're not sitting there wondering
[2:03:40] does he hear
[2:03:42] because you know what you've been washed
[2:03:44] by the water there's no barrier between
[2:03:46] you and him now the blood's supposed to
[2:03:48] do that but brother brown says when you
[2:03:50] get into something you're not supposed
[2:03:51] to get into when you sin when you
[2:03:52] disbelieve he says that holy spirit
[2:03:54] pulls away from you
[2:03:56] right it's the presence you don't lose
[2:03:58] the life inside of you but that presence
[2:04:00] of the holy spirit pulls away because he
[2:04:02] can't be where sin is
[2:04:04] right and then you repent say lord help
[2:04:05] me not to do it again and now he can
[2:04:07] come back in if your life's clean
[2:04:08] there's no reason to expect him not to
[2:04:10] hear you amen
[2:04:12] what does it do it keeps the word of god
[2:04:14] fresh in our mind engraved in our hearts
[2:04:16] and that's what should be coming out of
[2:04:17] our mouth then throughout the week
[2:04:19] first john 5 says who is he that
[2:04:21] overcometh the world but he that
[2:04:23] believeth that jesus is the son of god
[2:04:25] simple question simple answer
[2:04:28] but why do you believe in jesus christ
[2:04:30] as the son of god
[2:04:31] because he's working in you the same way
[2:04:33] he was in christ
[2:04:34] right it's not just this mental
[2:04:36] intellectual thing that i believe in
[2:04:38] christ and therefore i'm an overcomer no
[2:04:40] you overcome because you believe in him
[2:04:42] in the works that he does you do also
[2:04:44] that's why you're overcoming is because
[2:04:45] the life of christ is inside of you
[2:04:47] this is he that came by water and blood
[2:04:49] even jesus christ not by water only but
[2:04:52] by water and blood and it is the spirit
[2:04:54] that beareth witness because the spirit
[2:04:56] is truth for there are three that bear
[2:04:58] record in heaven the father the word and
[2:05:00] the holy ghost and these three are one
[2:05:02] and there are three that bear witness in
[2:05:04] earth the spirit the water and the blood
[2:05:06] and these three agree in one in earth
[2:05:08] that's me
[2:05:09] right this is earth right this is dust
[2:05:12] this is dirt and then so in me those
[2:05:14] three the water the spirit and the blood
[2:05:16] are supposed to agree what in these
[2:05:18] earthen vessels this mystery that's
[2:05:19] hidden this treasure that's hidden in
[2:05:21] these earthen vessels is to bear witness
[2:05:23] of christ
[2:05:24] in you and i and it's all supposed to
[2:05:26] say the same thing so you can have
[2:05:29] something in your life that is different
[2:05:30] from the word and it be the spirit of
[2:05:32] god that's anointing it because they
[2:05:33] have to bear witness of the same thing
[2:05:34] brother brahm says they say the same
[2:05:36] thing they act the same way they do the
[2:05:38] same way so if you've got a witness in
[2:05:40] your life that isn't in line with the
[2:05:42] holy spirit or the word then something's
[2:05:43] wrong
[2:05:44] there's a witness that isn't being given
[2:05:46] properly amen they have to do the same
[2:05:48] thing to take you wide to a common goal
[2:05:51] they're taking you to the same place and
[2:05:52] they can't be saying two different
[2:05:53] things do contrary things amen
[2:05:56] brother brahman says this he says the
[2:05:57] token for the believer today is the holy
[2:05:59] ghost not a blood a chemistry but it is
[2:06:02] the holy spirit of god this is the token
[2:06:05] that god requires of the church today
[2:06:07] god must see the token he must see it in
[2:06:10] every one of us amen amen it's
[2:06:13] interesting when you when you see you
[2:06:14] know special meetings are going on and
[2:06:16] and everyone's shouting and dancing and
[2:06:18] raising their hands
[2:06:19] it's like brother braham said that's the
[2:06:20] rain falling on the just and the unjust
[2:06:22] right when you're in the presence of god
[2:06:24] most people can actually feel something
[2:06:26] as in they know something's different
[2:06:28] and it can cause a supernatural effect
[2:06:30] on you it'll cause you to do things you
[2:06:31] didn't do but he didn't say the token on
[2:06:33] you
[2:06:34] in other words coming to church and
[2:06:36] having great services is not the token
[2:06:38] he's looking for but he's looking for a
[2:06:40] token life in you
[2:06:42] amen so that when the meeting's over
[2:06:43] when the service is over you don't act
[2:06:45] any different out there than you did in
[2:06:46] here amen amen amen
[2:06:49] therefore as the evening shadows are
[2:06:51] appearing and the wrath is ready to be
[2:06:53] poured out from on high upon the ungodly
[2:06:55] nations and upon the ungodly believers
[2:06:57] upon the professors without a profession
[2:07:02] catch that
[2:07:04] people that are saying they've got it
[2:07:06] but they don't have a possession sorry
[2:07:09] professors without a possession i've got
[2:07:11] it i've got it i'm identified with it i
[2:07:13] go to church and this that and the other
[2:07:15] thing he says and they don't have a
[2:07:17] possession
[2:07:18] upon these things is the wrath can be
[2:07:20] poured out amen under the original law
[2:07:22] all god looked at was the blood
[2:07:24] that's all he was looking at him in it
[2:07:26] like we said in goshen if you have proof
[2:07:27] of that sacrifice if it was over the
[2:07:29] door then that's what he was going to
[2:07:30] look at right
[2:07:32] but it wouldn't pay the price but it
[2:07:33] would push the payment of the price down
[2:07:35] so that you didn't have to pay it that
[2:07:36] year
[2:07:37] brother probably in the message the
[2:07:39] token he says and i've tried to unfold
[2:07:41] myself and live right among it to see
[2:07:43] where it was standing before i said
[2:07:44] these things so he's preaching the token
[2:07:46] and then 1963 and it's such a burden on
[2:07:49] him and he's telling the people don't
[2:07:51] miss it whatever you do don't miss it
[2:07:53] but he says before i ever brought this
[2:07:56] to you he says i've tried to unfold
[2:07:58] myself and live in it
[2:08:00] as in to see is this the right is this
[2:08:02] the way it's supposed to be what is it
[2:08:03] doing in my life and then i'll bring to
[2:08:05] you what it's doing right he's making
[2:08:07] proof of it in his own life in his own
[2:08:09] ministry before he comes to you and says
[2:08:11] you've got to have the same thing
[2:08:13] right god's working on his prophet in
[2:08:15] his life before he can speak it he's got
[2:08:17] to live it and then he's preaching
[2:08:19] something that is absolutely essential
[2:08:20] to the believer he says i've made proof
[2:08:22] of this myself
[2:08:24] he says now we are living in the shadows
[2:08:26] and the wrath is ready to strike and god
[2:08:28] is requiring a token that you yourself
[2:08:30] have received his token the holy ghost
[2:08:33] it's the only way and the only sign that
[2:08:36] god will ever pass because
[2:08:38] it is the literal life of jesus christ
[2:08:42] returned back into the believer this is
[2:08:44] not a representation this is not a
[2:08:47] similarity this isn't a clone this is
[2:08:49] the exact same life that was in christ
[2:08:51] jesus is now living in the believer when
[2:08:53] they receive the holy ghost the only
[2:08:55] difference between you and he is that he
[2:08:57] had it in the fullness we have it in
[2:08:59] measure he had a sinless body we have a
[2:09:01] sinful body amen
[2:09:02] so what do we do we say my body's sinful
[2:09:05] my body is carnal my body drives me nuts
[2:09:08] i'm constantly fighting my body what's
[2:09:11] up with this
[2:09:12] i thought i was a believer i thought i
[2:09:14] had the holy ghost
[2:09:15] and why am i fighting day in and day out
[2:09:17] day in and day out
[2:09:20] romans 8
[2:09:22] says so then they that are in the flesh
[2:09:24] cannot please god so if you're dwelling
[2:09:26] in the flesh if you're focused on the
[2:09:28] flesh if you're giving yourselves into
[2:09:29] the lust of the flesh the desires of the
[2:09:31] flesh the things that make you feel good
[2:09:33] rather than the things that make you
[2:09:34] grow in god you cannot please god and
[2:09:36] you'll feel a separation
[2:09:38] and the problem often is is that we keep
[2:09:40] doing those things trying to close the
[2:09:42] separation and you're in your flesh
[2:09:45] amen that's harsh words and maybe that
[2:09:47] would support us when we say i'm in this
[2:09:49] flesh and it seems like i'm never
[2:09:50] winning i'm always fighting
[2:09:52] in romans 7 just before this paul said o
[2:09:55] wretched man that i am who shall deliver
[2:09:58] me from the body of this death
[2:10:00] this is the prophet of god anointed
[2:10:03] angel for the age he's got the holy
[2:10:05] ghost in a way that most people will
[2:10:06] never experience and he's saying who
[2:10:08] will deliver me from this body of flesh
[2:10:10] so there's a battle to be fought for
[2:10:12] each and every one of us because we're
[2:10:13] in the body of this death amen paul knew
[2:10:16] what it was to be a flawed human i'm so
[2:10:17] glad he brought us the book of romans so
[2:10:19] that we can see that there is a battle
[2:10:21] and it is okay to realize that you're
[2:10:23] not everything that you ought to be
[2:10:25] amen but i'm so glad he takes us into
[2:10:27] romans 8 and he says there is a remedy
[2:10:29] for being wretched there is a remedy for
[2:10:31] being dead there is a remedy for the
[2:10:33] battle that you're fighting and it is
[2:10:35] not to stay in it amen but he takes us
[2:10:38] into a place where what we can have a
[2:10:40] new birth and we're now not focused on
[2:10:41] this body while we're bringing it under
[2:10:44] a subjection because we are not a
[2:10:46] modified creature amen we are not a
[2:10:48] modified creature i didn't go into the
[2:10:50] water as jonathan corlett and come up as
[2:10:52] a similar jonathan curlette but jonathan
[2:10:55] corlett died there and christ is
[2:10:57] reigning supreme in my heart and he's
[2:10:58] bringing this body into subjection amen
[2:11:01] we are not an upgraded member of our old
[2:11:03] self
[2:11:04] i'm not jonathan corlett 2.0 jonathan
[2:11:07] curlett has to die he has to die in the
[2:11:10] water and come up so that christ can
[2:11:12] live
[2:11:13] and in romans 8 then paul says what
[2:11:15] there is therefore now no condemnation
[2:11:18] to them which are in christ jesus who
[2:11:20] walk not after the flesh but after the
[2:11:22] spirit so there's a spirit effect that's
[2:11:25] supposed to be happening in our lives
[2:11:27] and it's going to supersede the walk of
[2:11:29] the flesh he says for the law of the
[2:11:32] spirit of life in christ jesus hath made
[2:11:35] me free past tense continuous and
[2:11:39] forever it started at calvary and it
[2:11:40] goes on forever the spirit of the life
[2:11:43] in christ jesus has made me free from
[2:11:45] the law of sin and death what's the
[2:11:48] spirit what's the law of the spirit of
[2:11:50] life
[2:11:52] what does that look like in a believer
[2:11:55] let's read this
[2:11:56] paul said then with my mind and i have
[2:11:58] the mind of christ you see he said with
[2:12:01] my mind i serve god but with the flesh
[2:12:03] the law of sin what is it this is the
[2:12:06] law of the flesh my flesh says tonight
[2:12:09] you're too tired your throat is too sore
[2:12:11] you've been out in the wind today you
[2:12:13] shall not go up to church tonight this
[2:12:15] is in questions and answers so he knows
[2:12:16] he's going to go up he's going to be
[2:12:18] facing all these questions he's going to
[2:12:19] be have to be quick on his feet you know
[2:12:21] these different things and he says my
[2:12:22] body's telling me you don't need to go
[2:12:24] to church tonight
[2:12:26] to do your duty
[2:12:28] as a prophet to the age
[2:12:29] that's the law of the flesh
[2:12:32] you might as well just call them up and
[2:12:34] tell brother neville to send the
[2:12:35] questions down and tell him to answer
[2:12:37] them but you see i promised to do that
[2:12:40] see
[2:12:42] he says now my mind on the inside the
[2:12:45] holy spirit said you keep your promise
[2:12:48] but the flesh said you're too tired see
[2:12:51] now the flesh will say now there's no
[2:12:53] need you pretty little thing you're the
[2:12:54] prettiest little thing in school now
[2:12:56] don't you pay any attention to that holy
[2:12:58] rolling mother of yours or that fanatic
[2:12:59] father see you're the best looking girl
[2:13:01] in school you're the best looking boy
[2:13:03] the best built you're the most popular
[2:13:05] there is in the city you see you yield
[2:13:06] your members to that and where do you
[2:13:08] come out at the little end of the horn
[2:13:09] every time see
[2:13:11] paul said my flesh wants always to yield
[2:13:15] to that
[2:13:16] there's always a battle
[2:13:18] there is always a battle
[2:13:20] that's why we're called overcomers is
[2:13:21] because we battle amen your flesh does
[2:13:25] too see but the law of the spirit of god
[2:13:28] in the heart overcomes the flesh and
[2:13:30] makes the body obey what the heart says
[2:13:33] do
[2:13:33] hallelujah look then
[2:13:35] catch this if that will if it will do
[2:13:38] that for a sinner
[2:13:40] then won't that work for sickness too
[2:13:43] the law of the spirit of god in the
[2:13:45] heart that knows that by his stripes we
[2:13:47] were healed they stand with their power
[2:13:50] and make that sickness in that body obey
[2:13:53] them because it's a devil there you are
[2:13:56] phew he says that's it see what is it
[2:13:58] there's a progressive effect on the
[2:13:59] believer the faith that comes from the
[2:14:01] indwelling holy spirit what does it do
[2:14:03] it gets you to the water it gets you to
[2:14:05] repent then you get filled and then what
[2:14:08] does it do it takes you now from faith
[2:14:10] to believe for salvation to faith to
[2:14:12] push out what disease
[2:14:15] oppression whatever's in there he says
[2:14:17] the same spirit that gets you to that
[2:14:18] point just keeps moving on just keep
[2:14:20] pushing things out that aren't supposed
[2:14:22] to be in that body because what we're in
[2:14:23] a restoration redemption process amen
[2:14:27] what is healing healing is the earnest
[2:14:28] of the resurrection amen without healing
[2:14:30] we don't have the resurrection why do
[2:14:32] you think brother branham focused so
[2:14:33] much on healing because it was what was
[2:14:35] pointing us to the greatest healing
[2:14:37] we're ever going to get which is a new
[2:14:38] body amen
[2:14:41] he says now the law of sin and death
[2:14:43] works in your flesh but the law of the
[2:14:45] spirit of life works in your heart so
[2:14:48] your spirit
[2:14:49] your spirit in your heart will make your
[2:14:53] body
[2:14:54] obey what it says do
[2:14:57] that's exactly right that's what paul
[2:14:59] said
[2:15:00] how wonderful is that the law of the
[2:15:01] spirit of life in your heart will make
[2:15:03] your body obey what it says do so the
[2:15:05] question is what spirit is working in
[2:15:08] you
[2:15:10] it's a simple question
[2:15:11] if you look at the effect that'll tell
[2:15:13] you what spirit's working amen so if the
[2:15:16] spirit is saying move
[2:15:18] then it's going to move if the spirit is
[2:15:19] saying hey nice to have you here it's
[2:15:21] going to stay here amen if we've got a
[2:15:23] spirit of fellowship with a demon then
[2:15:24] what's going to happen that demon's
[2:15:26] going to have influence in our life
[2:15:27] isn't it but if we have a spirit of life
[2:15:29] we have a spirit of healing what's it
[2:15:31] going to do it's going to push that out
[2:15:32] you getting in with a with a spirit of
[2:15:35] depression what's going to happen you're
[2:15:37] going to get get depressed you get close
[2:15:39] to the spirit of deliverance and that's
[2:15:40] going to move isn't it you get into a
[2:15:42] spirit of worship and it's not going to
[2:15:43] matter if it's brother mark brother bob
[2:15:45] myself up here leading songs it's not
[2:15:47] going to matter who's playing and how
[2:15:48] well they're playing you're going to
[2:15:49] worship no matter what amen why because
[2:15:52] the spirit of worship is not is in you
[2:15:53] it's not in them as in it is not
[2:15:55] dependent on them it's in you and it's a
[2:15:57] wellspring coming up within you and
[2:15:59] nothing's going to stop and it's no
[2:16:00] different than the spirit of healing as
[2:16:02] it rises up it's going to push out
[2:16:04] whatever was holding it back amen all
[2:16:06] it's doing all that's doing all that
[2:16:07] disease is doing is it's building up the
[2:16:09] pressure of the holy spirit in your life
[2:16:10] before boom it can't sustain it anymore
[2:16:13] amen some things hold on a little harder
[2:16:14] than others
[2:16:16] amen
[2:16:17] the good thing is is that all of the
[2:16:18] good things we're looking for are in one
[2:16:20] spirit
[2:16:21] but you're gonna fight many spirits of
[2:16:22] the bad things amen but you only need
[2:16:24] one spirit to defeat them and that is
[2:16:25] the spirit the law of the spirit of life
[2:16:28] in you which is the spirit of life in
[2:16:29] christ jesus
[2:16:30] amen we can have the holy ghost and
[2:16:33] still have a demon influence in our life
[2:16:35] absolutely because what the holy spirit
[2:16:38] is in our soul it's sealed to the day of
[2:16:39] redemption but in your spirit realm
[2:16:41] you're open to any influence that's out
[2:16:43] there and all you're looking for is he
[2:16:44] says he's just saying that's what's in
[2:16:45] your heart the spirit in your heart work
[2:16:48] in your body in your mind in these
[2:16:49] different things to push those out but
[2:16:50] you can absolutely be under a demonic
[2:16:52] influence and have the spirit in your
[2:16:53] holy spirit in your life
[2:16:56] romans 8 says but ye are not in the
[2:16:58] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[2:17:00] the spirit of god dwells in you now if
[2:17:02] any man have not the spirit of christ
[2:17:04] he's none of his yeah i believe the
[2:17:06] message brother john
[2:17:07] so
[2:17:08] the devil does too that's why he's
[2:17:10] fighting it
[2:17:11] amen but that's only a starting place at
[2:17:14] best because you've got to become the
[2:17:15] message not just believe the message
[2:17:17] amen the bible says without the holy
[2:17:19] spirit you're not a child of god
[2:17:21] now
[2:17:22] does that mean if i don't have it today
[2:17:24] i'm not a child of god no child of god
[2:17:26] you're known by predestination the seed
[2:17:27] is in there but until that seed is
[2:17:29] quickened by the holy spirit you don't
[2:17:30] know if you're actually a child of god
[2:17:31] but that's the proof in you is the holy
[2:17:33] spirit but if christ be in you the body
[2:17:36] is dead because of sin but the spirit is
[2:17:38] life because of righteousness but if the
[2:17:40] spirit of him that raised up jesus from
[2:17:42] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[2:17:44] christ from the dead shall also quicken
[2:17:47] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[2:17:50] dwelleth in you now we look at that
[2:17:51] scripture we keep pointing to a
[2:17:52] resurrection and a rapture
[2:17:56] paul has just talked about a completely
[2:17:57] different thing going on what is it
[2:17:59] you've got to you don't have to wait for
[2:18:00] a theophany to be quickened you're being
[2:18:02] quickened in this right now today day in
[2:18:05] and day out that's been quick into what
[2:18:07] let you know who you are to let you know
[2:18:09] that the spirit of god is in you to do
[2:18:10] the works that he did also amen you got
[2:18:13] to be quick in here before you can be
[2:18:14] quickened into a theophany and that's
[2:18:16] what we're here to go through amen we're
[2:18:17] not waiting to be put into the theophany
[2:18:19] bodies to be quickened amen but we're in
[2:18:20] a battle in this body but we've been
[2:18:22] made alive the minute that you died and
[2:18:25] christ came in you've been made alive
[2:18:26] and nothing can ever take that away
[2:18:28] brethren says you can't kill eternal
[2:18:29] life
[2:18:30] right eternal life doesn't end once you
[2:18:32] got it you have it forever amen
[2:18:34] so the question is what needs to be made
[2:18:36] alive in you today
[2:18:39] what needs to be made alive what holds
[2:18:40] us back
[2:18:41] what's going on in our lives that isn't
[2:18:43] alive
[2:18:44] joy peace all these things
[2:18:47] this is all readily available to the
[2:18:48] holy ghost filled believer because it's
[2:18:49] the fruit of the spirit amen that's all
[2:18:52] available to us
[2:18:53] so if you lack it it's not because you
[2:18:55] don't have the holy spirit it's because
[2:18:56] you've got something blocking it up or
[2:18:58] maybe because you don't have the holy
[2:18:59] spirit i can't say you do or you don't
[2:19:01] it's not my thing but potential is not
[2:19:04] the problem event brother brahma as we
[2:19:06] said last time brown says when you get
[2:19:07] the holy ghost he says you have power in
[2:19:09] you potential in you to create a world
[2:19:11] and go live on it but he says the thing
[2:19:13] that stops you is the law of god which
[2:19:14] says that's not the purpose of the holy
[2:19:15] spirit but the the the potential is
[2:19:17] there to do it power power's not the
[2:19:19] problem
[2:19:20] because all power belongs to him
[2:19:22] authority is not the problem because he
[2:19:24] says he's given all authority to the
[2:19:25] church through christ our head right so
[2:19:28] that's not the problem the seals are
[2:19:29] open the names on the lam's book of life
[2:19:31] are being read
[2:19:32] right
[2:19:33] do we lack an opening of the word no
[2:19:35] so what's holding us back
[2:19:38] there's two things holding us back
[2:19:40] maybe three or four
[2:19:42] faith
[2:19:43] but faith comes by revelation and
[2:19:45] revelation comes from god so you don't
[2:19:47] get that by yourself so that's not your
[2:19:48] problem that's god's problem right
[2:19:50] revelation to give you faith to do what
[2:19:52] god wants you to do amen god has a
[2:19:54] purpose and a plan he has a timing for
[2:19:56] everything so that's up to him he
[2:19:57] controls the throttle on the engine how
[2:19:59] fast or how slow we're going to go amen
[2:20:01] but we're walking the road and it's god
[2:20:02] that gives and god that takes and god
[2:20:04] that puts the brakes on and then god
[2:20:05] that speeds us up
[2:20:07] but what holds us back we've got the
[2:20:08] doctrine we've got the full truth we've
[2:20:10] got a revelation of the plan of god
[2:20:11] there's nothing that's hidden to us in
[2:20:14] terms of the scriptures being revealed
[2:20:15] as far as i can tell brother bob said
[2:20:17] the only thing that's left is the
[2:20:18] rapture and the resurrection that tells
[2:20:20] me that everything's open right
[2:20:21] revelation 10 7 is done
[2:20:23] right the mystery of god is supposed to
[2:20:25] be finished so that's just now mysteries
[2:20:27] and earth and vessels that's waiting to
[2:20:28] be fully revealed because the words have
[2:20:29] all been revealed to us amen
[2:20:32] i believe there's only one thing left
[2:20:34] for us to do
[2:20:35] and this is where we have a play this is
[2:20:37] where we have a part
[2:20:38] galatians 2 20 says i am crucified with
[2:20:42] christ
[2:20:43] nevertheless i live
[2:20:45] yet not i but christ liveth in me and
[2:20:48] the life which i now live
[2:20:50] in my head
[2:20:52] in my mind
[2:20:54] no he says the life i live in the flesh
[2:20:57] i live by the faith of the son of god
[2:21:00] who loved me and gave himself for me
[2:21:03] amen we need to be crucified
[2:21:05] that's the only thing holding us back is
[2:21:07] a crucified life amen we surrender our
[2:21:09] will when we go down in baptism but when
[2:21:11] we come up now we've got to open up all
[2:21:13] the doors of our of our house don't we
[2:21:15] amen we don't just need to die out for a
[2:21:17] moment
[2:21:18] right so often that's what we do is
[2:21:20] we'll
[2:21:21] we'll sit under the preach of the word
[2:21:22] we'll go to special meetings we'll we'll
[2:21:24] have a certain thing in and and we'll
[2:21:26] we'll only open up one door
[2:21:29] right but we've got 73 others that need
[2:21:30] to be opened as well and god's just
[2:21:32] waiting for us to surrender and open up
[2:21:33] those doors as we go bit by bit amen
[2:21:35] it's not just in church that we have to
[2:21:37] surrender it's in our day-to-day
[2:21:38] devotions it's in our day-to-day prayer
[2:21:40] life as we start to make decisions and
[2:21:42] different things we surrender and say
[2:21:43] lord what would your will be not mine
[2:21:45] amen
[2:21:46] what we need to die out so completely
[2:21:48] that god has a path to work within our
[2:21:50] lives that has never been done since the
[2:21:52] book of acts that's what we're looking
[2:21:54] for
[2:21:55] brother branham's gift remember was to
[2:21:57] get himself out of the way so what am i
[2:22:00] looking for
[2:22:01] get jonathan curlette out of the way
[2:22:05] amen
[2:22:06] i've said it before i hear people
[2:22:08] talking about power and authority i see
[2:22:10] very people very few people talking
[2:22:11] about a dead people first you've got to
[2:22:14] die out before you can ever be in power
[2:22:16] and authority amen
[2:22:17] and then i'm looking for people that
[2:22:19] walk the talk not just talk the talk i'm
[2:22:20] looking for people that can say like
[2:22:22] paul
[2:22:23] it's not i that live it's christ that
[2:22:25] lives within me jonathan colette is
[2:22:27] crucified jonathan corletta is dead and
[2:22:29] the only thing that's left is jesus
[2:22:30] christ because jonathan curlette has
[2:22:32] realized there's nothing in him that's
[2:22:34] worth taking out of this world
[2:22:37] right i've got to come to the place
[2:22:38] where i think so little of what's in
[2:22:40] this flesh that i won't even entertain
[2:22:42] the thought much less act on it amen
[2:22:44] that's the sacrifice that we're looking
[2:22:46] for that's the crucifixion my mom shared
[2:22:48] this with with a bunch of us in the
[2:22:50] family and it fit in perfectly as i was
[2:22:52] closing out the service and he said
[2:22:55] brother bram says what kind of a people
[2:22:56] would it be this morning in this
[2:22:58] tabernacle this morning if this
[2:23:00] tabernacle this morning was so filled
[2:23:02] with the presence of god while you
[2:23:04] didn't even use your own mind didn't
[2:23:07] even use your own thoughts didn't even
[2:23:09] have no motive or input of your own but
[2:23:12] just to be led by the spirit and they
[2:23:14] that are sons of god are led by the
[2:23:16] spirit of god then when the human
[2:23:19] element goes out and the spirit of god
[2:23:21] fills that vacancy where you empty
[2:23:23] yourself amen then will be when the
[2:23:26] church and its power of the resurrection
[2:23:28] of the lord jesus will walk in his steps
[2:23:31] in his power in his thoughts in his
[2:23:34] being in his moving
[2:23:36] it's not just speak the word it's get
[2:23:38] yourself out so that the words that you
[2:23:40] speak are in his will and in his time
[2:23:42] amen you see what i mean then your
[2:23:45] thoughts will become words what when
[2:23:47] you've emptied yourself of all of yours
[2:23:49] then your thoughts will become words
[2:23:51] words that can be acted on and words
[2:23:53] will become material that's when the
[2:23:55] church
[2:23:56] is in its power i believe it's on the
[2:23:59] road
[2:24:00] amen this is in 1954.
[2:24:04] if it was on the road in 54 and we're in
[2:24:06] 2022 where is it
[2:24:07] it's got to be here
[2:24:10] i believe it's on the road that when the
[2:24:12] church will be so wrapped in christ the
[2:24:14] holy spirit and mankind sow away from
[2:24:17] their cells that they don't see
[2:24:18] themselves they don't have no desire but
[2:24:21] to serve god
[2:24:23] what are we wrapped up in
[2:24:25] what is it that consumes our time our
[2:24:27] free moments where do you spend your
[2:24:28] energy is it pointing to christ
[2:24:31] he says
[2:24:32] their thoughts move on
[2:24:36] that's my prayer
[2:24:38] my thoughts
[2:24:39] move on amen amen they refuse the things
[2:24:43] of the world
[2:24:45] amen can we say that we're refusing the
[2:24:47] things of the world they just move in
[2:24:49] the spirit live in the spirit move in
[2:24:52] the spirit walk in the spirit and so
[2:24:54] fulfill the law of christ then the love
[2:24:57] of christ in the human heart moving in
[2:25:00] the holy ghost that great wonderful
[2:25:02] church will go forth with power and
[2:25:05] deity because deity will be revealed in
[2:25:08] human beings by the holy spirit bringing
[2:25:11] to pass the thoughts of their mind
[2:25:14] what a place empty yourself of your
[2:25:16] thoughts and then he says it'll be your
[2:25:17] thoughts that bring it why because it is
[2:25:19] the mind of christ in you that's
[2:25:20] thinking the thoughts for you to speak
[2:25:22] act on expect and manifest
[2:25:25] he says our thoughts run different our
[2:25:27] carnal thoughts a lot of times we walk
[2:25:28] up and say how do you do brother and you
[2:25:30] don't mean it in your heart a lot of
[2:25:32] times we say i'm this and that i'll do
[2:25:33] that and you don't mean it in your heart
[2:25:35] see i don't mean it in my heart but when
[2:25:37] you can become so dead to the things of
[2:25:40] the world that christ is first
[2:25:42] christ is first christ is all then your
[2:25:46] entire makeup is of the spirit of the
[2:25:48] lord jesus christ he has full control
[2:25:51] that's when your thoughts will be clean
[2:25:54] your thoughts will be pure
[2:25:56] your heart
[2:25:57] that's why i say silence is golden
[2:25:59] because so often we're speaking so much
[2:26:01] and we're talking so much and we have so
[2:26:03] much to share and the question is is it
[2:26:05] the lord speaking remember what we
[2:26:07] talked about where brother brown says
[2:26:09] the bride will have the word and shall
[2:26:10] know what to do with it shall have thus
[2:26:12] say it the lord or she'll keep silent
[2:26:16] amen
[2:26:17] especially with social media these days
[2:26:20] everybody's got something to say i'm
[2:26:21] noticing and listening to messages
[2:26:23] lately how brother brown would often go
[2:26:25] and he just sit away quietly
[2:26:26] get away from everything he didn't go
[2:26:28] out and try and preach to everybody he
[2:26:30] just went and he got aside until god
[2:26:32] would come and tell what he was supposed
[2:26:34] to do and then he'd come out and do it
[2:26:36] and then he wouldn't get himself caught
[2:26:37] in the affairs of life he had to get
[2:26:39] quiet so he could get what leadership
[2:26:41] direction peace rest all these different
[2:26:43] things and then he moved from there he
[2:26:45] wouldn't go try and find it with other
[2:26:46] people he'd go to a place of quietness
[2:26:48] and find a theory man
[2:26:50] men and james paul said or in james
[2:26:53] james said religious a religious man
[2:26:56] bridleth not his tongue and his religion
[2:26:58] is vain
[2:26:59] amen
[2:27:01] but the jail talks about this quote many
[2:27:03] times and i looked it up the other day
[2:27:05] because i wanted to see the full quote
[2:27:06] brother joe he quotes one thing and i
[2:27:07] want to see the whole quote i mean i
[2:27:09] wanted to see the context i wanted to
[2:27:10] see what the prophet of god was talking
[2:27:12] about and it's in the message what was
[2:27:13] the holy ghost given for and he says now
[2:27:16] but now when we need it the spirit of
[2:27:19] god raises a standard do you have a need
[2:27:22] do you have a need this morning
[2:27:24] it says the holy spirit raises a
[2:27:26] standard what is that standard he says
[2:27:29] what is it
[2:27:31] he is pouring in his spirit
[2:27:35] what is it when the spirit raises the
[2:27:37] standard it's more of the spirit right
[2:27:39] to what meet the challenge that you're
[2:27:41] facing and then
[2:27:43] those who are resting out yonder in the
[2:27:45] grave are under the altar of god as the
[2:27:46] scripture says are crying how long lord
[2:27:49] how long how much longer god is waiting
[2:27:52] on me and you
[2:27:55] but he says the church is waiting on me
[2:27:57] and you
[2:27:58] what is he waiting for
[2:28:00] adoption time when god can pour into us
[2:28:03] his fullness his power his resurrection
[2:28:06] that when the church and christ become
[2:28:08] so close together till christ becomes
[2:28:10] visible among us and raises the dead and
[2:28:13] we go into the rapture
[2:28:14] so they're waiting for us
[2:28:16] but what are they waiting for adoption
[2:28:18] time
[2:28:19] when god can pour his spirit into us for
[2:28:22] the full manifestation of the sons and
[2:28:24] daughters of god amen
[2:28:29] amen they're waiting on full adoption
[2:28:30] that's the final element of the rapture
[2:28:32] before we go is that there's that quick
[2:28:33] short work
[2:28:35] where we know it
[2:28:36] they know it we have that fellowship
[2:28:37] with the saints and then off we go amen
[2:28:40] but the son doesn't choose his adoption
[2:28:42] day
[2:28:43] they're waiting on us but the son
[2:28:45] doesn't choose his adoption day the son
[2:28:47] doesn't say all right let's go on the
[2:28:49] rapture this morning right what does the
[2:28:51] sun do he is submitted to the tutor and
[2:28:54] then the tutor goes back and says he's
[2:28:55] ready
[2:28:56] so when they're waiting on you and i are
[2:28:58] they waiting on brother bob to catch
[2:29:00] faith for the rapture no because brother
[2:29:02] bob can't give himself faith for the
[2:29:03] rapture that can only come from god so
[2:29:05] that's not up to brother bob to have
[2:29:06] faith for the rapture what does brother
[2:29:08] bob have to have faith for
[2:29:10] to surrender to the word and trust that
[2:29:12] that's going to bring him to the rapture
[2:29:13] amen so the only thing that's looking
[2:29:15] there in the believer's life for them to
[2:29:17] do is surrender keep your life clean you
[2:29:20] know what friends you have you know what
[2:29:21] you're feeding on you know where you're
[2:29:22] spending your time you know where you're
[2:29:23] spending your energy that's all the
[2:29:25] stuff that we can control
[2:29:27] that's the only thing we can do to bring
[2:29:28] the rapture closer is feed on the right
[2:29:30] things be around the right people and do
[2:29:32] what the word of god tells us to do and
[2:29:34] be led by the spirit that's all we can
[2:29:36] do everything else after that is up to
[2:29:37] god because like i said you're not
[2:29:39] getting off this planet in a rapture
[2:29:41] because you decide to do it
[2:29:42] what you're doing is you're making a
[2:29:44] decision every day for the rapture
[2:29:45] right every decision you make is yay for
[2:29:48] the rapture or yay for staying here a
[2:29:49] while longer what by what you allow into
[2:29:51] your life it's like an engine that makes
[2:29:53] a thousand horsepower
[2:29:55] right but what controls that engine is
[2:29:57] what a gas pedal that's linked to a
[2:29:58] throttle and a fuel system and guess
[2:30:01] what you can be capable of a thousand
[2:30:03] horsepower but until the driver pushes
[2:30:04] that gas pedal to the floor you can't
[2:30:06] make a thousand horsepower you're
[2:30:07] capable of it but it's up to the driver
[2:30:09] to tell you and it's the same thing with
[2:30:10] god god's up there and what's he doing
[2:30:12] he's throttling everything he's balanced
[2:30:14] it out he knows what's got to happen
[2:30:15] when it's got to happen and when we need
[2:30:17] to move then he gives us a shot of the
[2:30:18] gas but guess what sometimes he lets off
[2:30:21] and says whoa
[2:30:22] something's not sounding right in that
[2:30:23] engine let's tune it up a bit right
[2:30:25] let's do a flushing of the fuel system
[2:30:28] oh it sounds like there's some carbon on
[2:30:29] the valves we need to get that cleared
[2:30:30] out otherwise we'll blow up if we try
[2:30:32] and use a thousand horsepower right now
[2:30:34] amen what's he doing he's making sure
[2:30:35] that that engine is perfect before he
[2:30:37] puts the full power into it amen
[2:30:40] but mark was talking about the world
[2:30:41] being shaken and guess what it is being
[2:30:43] shaken amen but it's not just the world
[2:30:45] that's been shaken because what that
[2:30:47] engine's got to get clean that bride's
[2:30:48] got to get ready for the fullness of the
[2:30:50] power of god inside of her amen and
[2:30:52] that's got to shake off a lot of
[2:30:53] clingers right a lot of things that are
[2:30:55] just hanging onto us that we've let go
[2:30:56] on for way too long and then we've got
[2:30:58] to let go and let god have his way
[2:31:00] brother braham says this and we're
[2:31:02] closing he says why you're baptized in
[2:31:03] the word that's right by one spirit
[2:31:06] we're all baptized into one body and
[2:31:07] that body is christ is that right yes
[2:31:10] sir by one spirit all baptized into the
[2:31:12] body of god then you're baptized into
[2:31:15] god you're fortified with god his word
[2:31:17] is your fortress and he's a mighty tower
[2:31:20] the name of the lord is a mighty tower
[2:31:22] the righteous run into it and are safe
[2:31:24] he's my fortress my buckler my shield my
[2:31:27] shoes my hat my coat my heart my all in
[2:31:30] all god all in all god wrapped up in him
[2:31:33] dead to the world rolls with him in
[2:31:35] resurrection not i live anymore but
[2:31:38] christ that lives in us can you say he's
[2:31:40] my all in all
[2:31:42] or do we run to the arm of flesh so
[2:31:43] quickly when things get tough
[2:31:45] because when he's our all in all we have
[2:31:47] rest
[2:31:48] amen when we truly give him everything
[2:31:50] then we have rest in what he's going to
[2:31:51] do
[2:31:52] he says now as soon as we got big enough
[2:31:55] that we could get off the corner and get
[2:31:57] off the little mission somewhere we're
[2:31:58] trying to build churches that's bigger
[2:32:00] than the next fellow we want to outshine
[2:32:02] the methodists the presbyterians the
[2:32:04] baptists he says that's not your
[2:32:08] purpose that's not why you are what you
[2:32:11] are
[2:32:13] god already had that
[2:32:16] he didn't raise you up for that he
[2:32:18] raised you as an example that he might
[2:32:20] place his power in you
[2:32:22] to show forth his glory
[2:32:25] amen god bless you let's stand if you
[2:32:27] would this this morning
[2:32:33] he raised you as an example that he
[2:32:34] might place his power in you to show
[2:32:37] forth his glory guess what we're not
[2:32:38] here to prove ourselves
[2:32:40] we're not here to prove anything
[2:32:42] it's not up to us to do the proving it's
[2:32:43] up to god to do the proving in us amen
[2:32:46] we're not here to develop a great
[2:32:48] reputation we're not here to be known
[2:32:50] for gifts and all of these different
[2:32:51] things but we're here that he could do
[2:32:52] what show forth his glory in us amen
[2:32:55] amen my desire for this year has been
[2:32:57] less of me
[2:32:59] amen less of jonathan corlett less of my
[2:33:02] thoughts less of my words and more
[2:33:04] quietness and more looking to him to do
[2:33:06] the things in our lives that we need to
[2:33:07] amen not just as a minister as a father
[2:33:10] as a husband as a member of the
[2:33:11] community whatever it might be that i
[2:33:13] would be a greater witness for him and
[2:33:15] the only way i can be a greater witness
[2:33:17] is is if there's less of me amen i've
[2:33:19] got to surrender i've got to die i've
[2:33:21] got to crucify everything that's inside
[2:33:23] of me day in and day out as we said take
[2:33:26] my hands off the steering wheel and then
[2:33:28] take my hands off the steering wheel and
[2:33:29] say lord you're the one that's in
[2:33:30] control and even when it feels out of
[2:33:32] control you're still in control amen
[2:33:35] amen we need to be more sincere
[2:33:38] you know we need to be more honest with
[2:33:39] ourselves like i said not in
[2:33:40] condemnation when we look at the word
[2:33:42] and we see we don't match up but we say
[2:33:44] lord we're looking to you to draw us to
[2:33:45] a higher plane and then we sing that
[2:33:47] song a higher plane than i have found
[2:33:49] lord plant my feet on higher ground you
[2:33:51] can't get there if you don't think
[2:33:52] you're if you already think you're on
[2:33:53] that plane you've got to recognize where
[2:33:55] you're at amen and then say lord bring
[2:33:57] me to a higher level i want to grow
[2:33:59] i want to grow not just up but out amen
[2:34:02] not in the natural body remember in the
[2:34:04] spiritual body to where that fullness
[2:34:05] can be inside of me amen
[2:34:08] amen lord take it all out and replace it
