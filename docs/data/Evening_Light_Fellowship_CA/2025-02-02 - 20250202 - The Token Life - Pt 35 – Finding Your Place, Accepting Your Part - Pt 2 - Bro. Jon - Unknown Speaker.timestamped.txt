[49:02] Lord we can be whole if we want to be
[49:04] whole we can be at rest if we want to be

[49:14] pray you break chains this morning Lord
[49:16] I pray you set us free to worship you

[49:56] name we pray amen amen God bless you
[50:00] turn if you would to Psalm

[50:05] one this morning good to see some
[50:06] sunshine outside amen good to see Sister
[50:09] Mary Beth back with us amen glad to see
[50:12] she's doing better certainly want to
[50:14] welcome brother Lloyd and his daughter
[50:15] as well God bless you brother and then I
[50:18] sure appreciate that special sister
[50:19] Becky amen God bless you beautiful amen
[50:22] we want the dove to lead us you've got
[50:25] to have a sheep nature you've got to
[50:27] have the right kind of nature to allow a
[50:29] dove to lead you amen and it takes the
[50:31] right attitude the right Spirit to allow
[50:33] him to do that Psalms 127:1 says this
[50:37] except the Lord build the house they
[50:40] labor in vain that build it except the
[50:42] Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh
[50:45] but in vain amen God bless you you can
[50:47] have your seats this morning and we're
[50:49] continuing our series on the Holy Ghost
[50:51] and I want to take a second service on
[50:53] finding your place and accepting your
[50:55] part and last spirit last service we
[50:57] spoke mainly about the the gifts in the
[50:59] church we talked about the nine
[51:00] spiritual gifts that are available in
[51:02] the Church of God and we spoke of the
[51:04] different offices and the
[51:05] administrations and these different
[51:07] things and they're all there for either
[51:09] children of God to be used in or those
[51:10] things to use children of God but one
[51:13] thing we learned last service is not
[51:14] everybody has them all amen not everyone
[51:17] has them all and there's only one
[51:18] example that had it all and that was
[51:19] Christ that was the fullness of the
[51:21] godhead bodily and flesh and he had
[51:23] everything in him that there was but
[51:24] each one of us just has a portion
[51:27] and that means that we need each other
[51:29] that's what it means because remember
[51:30] the word now has been distributed the
[51:33] life has been distributed and so each
[51:34] one of us has a portion and you don't
[51:36] have it all and I don't have it all and
[51:38] even if we think we do we don't and so
[51:40] we need every single one that's a
[51:42] portion of that word this morning and if
[51:44] we see a Believer off by themselves I'll
[51:46] tell you today whether they'll they'll
[51:48] accept it or not they're unhealthy
[51:50] they're unhealthy because they're not
[51:52] giving what they have and they're not
[51:54] receiving what others have and they're
[51:56] they become an island and a person under
[51:58] themselves and that's not the way God
[51:59] has built us he's built us to be part of
[52:01] a body of Believers we're here with a
[52:03] purpose and our purpose is found when
[52:05] we're joined together in that body now
[52:07] last service we spoke how we've been
[52:09] placed into that body of Jesus Christ
[52:11] that's the bride of Christ and we know
[52:13] that it's the work of the holy spirit
[52:14] that does it the placing is always by
[52:17] the holy spirit it's not by your
[52:18] choosing it's not by your preference so
[52:20] that means where we are and what we do
[52:23] is up to him not to us amen it's his
[52:26] decision that does that we don't get to
[52:28] pick our decision but our purpose is to
[52:30] find our place and stay there that's the
[52:34] purpose for the believer and we read
[52:36] this in our opening scripture that if we
[52:37] decide where we want to
[52:39] go then the house is built in vain if we
[52:43] decide how it works if we decide what
[52:45] goes into it and it's in vain but if
[52:47] we'll let him do it if we'll let the
[52:49] Lord build the house then he will set
[52:51] the bride in order and so we see this in
[52:53] 1 Peter 2 Peter says this ye also as Li
[52:56] stones are built up a spiritual house a
[53:00] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[53:03] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[53:05] Christ he says but ye are a chosen
[53:08] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[53:11] nation A peculiar people that word
[53:15] peculiar that that phrase peculiar
[53:17] people means a people that are chosen
[53:19] for his possession for his acquisition
[53:23] and for his preservation so in other
[53:25] words you are his he will find you he'll
[53:28] prepare you and he'll keep you you're
[53:30] the you're the you're the the children
[53:32] of his body you are the word that came
[53:34] out from him he says and why are you
[53:36] this way that you should show forth the
[53:38] Praises of him who ha called you out of
[53:40] Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which
[53:43] in times past we not a people we are
[53:45] Gentiles scattered all over the Earth
[53:47] but now are now a people of God which
[53:50] are had not obtained Mercy but now have
[53:53] obtained mercy so we're not what we were
[53:57] today we were something else but we are
[54:00] something else today and it's his mercy
[54:02] and his grace that changes us but I want
[54:04] to spend some time this morning before
[54:06] we get into our main message because I
[54:08] said something at the end of service and
[54:09] I didn't really explain it I just left
[54:11] it hanging there and I felt the Lord
[54:13] tell me to come back and and dwell on it
[54:15] this morning I said this one thing I
[54:16] said a willing heart does not mean we
[54:19] are gifted or called and I said that and
[54:22] that doesn't sit well with people
[54:24] sometimes because we feel if we want to
[54:25] do it and we've got something in our
[54:27] heart to do it that means we ought to do
[54:29] it but see we have to clarify what the
[54:32] difference is between a willing heart
[54:34] and a heart's desire see they are two
[54:36] very different things see a willing
[54:38] Heart is Open to leadership a heart's
[54:41] desire has a something that it wants to
[54:43] do a willing Heart is Open to what is
[54:46] needed to be done so I want to take us
[54:48] back to the scriptures to talk about
[54:49] that this morning because so often we
[54:52] take our willing heart as an openness to
[54:54] go and do something and that is not the
[54:56] way it works in the scripture and in
[54:58] Exodus 35 just for the sake of time I'm
[55:00] going to just tell it to you rather than
[55:02] read it to you Moses lays out a list of
[55:05] all the things that are required for the
[55:07] Tabernacle of God so catch this idea now
[55:10] God designs the
[55:12] Tabernacle Moses doesn't design it man
[55:15] doesn't design it God designs it and he
[55:17] gives those plans to
[55:20] Moses in other words he gives the word
[55:22] to Moses of what this Temple this
[55:24] Tabernacle is supposed to look like and
[55:26] so Moses takes that list at that design
[55:29] and he breaks it down into what we would
[55:31] call a bill of materials right brother
[55:32] Matt somebody has to take that design
[55:35] that's in the Master's head and they
[55:37] break it down into a list by an item by
[55:39] item list of everything that's going to
[55:41] be needed there needed for the
[55:43] construction needed for the the the
[55:45] everything that's that's built inside
[55:47] that Tabernacle and then Moses takes
[55:49] this and he comes to the people with it
[55:51] and it says and Moses spake unto the
[55:52] congregation of the children of Israel
[55:54] saying this is the thing which the Lord
[55:56] commanded saying take ye from among you
[55:59] an offering unto the Lord and whosoever
[56:02] is of a willing heart let him bring it
[56:05] an offering of the Lord gold and silver
[56:08] and brass and then it would continue
[56:10] another 14 verses of all the things that
[56:12] are needed and it talks about precious
[56:15] stones and oil excuse me spices goat
[56:19] hair cloth furniture and all sorts of
[56:22] things all sorts of of parts and
[56:24] components that are needed so in other
[56:26] words there was a need in the body there
[56:28] was a need to do what God wanted to do
[56:31] and God never ordered anyone to meet the
[56:34] the need he says take an
[56:37] offering that means you have to give it
[56:39] out of your own free will he did not
[56:41] command them to give but he gave them an
[56:44] offering a t an opportunity to give an
[56:47] offering so a willing heart is tied to
[56:49] an
[56:50] offering it is not tied to a heart's
[56:52] desire it's tied to an offering it's not
[56:55] tied to commandment church we do what
[56:57] God says whether we feel like it or not
[56:59] that's what we ought to do now our heart
[57:01] ought to be in line with the word of God
[57:03] but even if we're feeling a little bit I
[57:05] don't want to do that yet we should do
[57:06] it because it's a commandment but when
[57:08] he gives an opportunity now that's where
[57:10] a willing heart comes in God gives us an
[57:13] opportunity to go above and beyond what
[57:15] he requires and that's where the Willing
[57:17] heart comes in because a willing heart
[57:19] is meant to respond to a need not to
[57:22] drive a personal desire amen so God
[57:26] given Moses a list Moses shares a list
[57:28] with the people but imagine now if
[57:31] you've got something that you want to
[57:33] give but it's not on the
[57:35] list imagine you have this beautiful
[57:38] Arabian horse pair that you took from
[57:41] the
[57:43] Egyptians but guess what there's no
[57:45] horses on the list but you come up to
[57:47] Moses and you say Moses I want to give
[57:49] you my
[57:51] horses what's Moses going to
[57:53] say Moses is going to look down over the
[57:56] the list and he's going to say I'm sorry
[57:57] there's no horses on the
[58:00] list and what have we done now we put
[58:02] Moses in an awkward position because
[58:04] you're coming up and you're saying I
[58:06] want a help and he's saying but that's
[58:08] not the kind of help I
[58:10] need and so then what happens when Moses
[58:13] turns us down is that's when we really
[58:16] figure out do we have a willing heart
[58:17] because do we go away and say well he
[58:19] should have taken it CU that's all I've
[58:20] got to
[58:22] give no that's a personal desire that's
[58:25] not a a willing heart cuz a willing
[58:27] heart will come with what is needed not
[58:30] just with what we have there's a very
[58:32] big difference there amen so what is it
[58:35] we can't force ourselves to meet a need
[58:39] that we
[58:40] create that's the way it works and we
[58:42] can see this on a very practical side
[58:44] when brother Paul and sister Kimberly
[58:46] set up the camp what did they do they
[58:48] have a master plan and then what do they
[58:50] do they say here's where we have a need
[58:53] will people come help and so when you
[58:55] come to help you don't come and say I'm
[58:58] here to vacuum you say what do you want
[59:01] me to do with a willing heart when the
[59:04] trustees come and we've had a big dump
[59:06] of snow and they say will you come and
[59:08] help clean uh clear the the walkways and
[59:10] whatnot we don't come and say I'm here
[59:12] to sweep with a broom we say what would
[59:15] you have me to do and they say well we
[59:17] want you to shovel the the sidewalk or
[59:19] we want you to go around back and clear
[59:20] out the stairwell or something like that
[59:22] we don't come in and say Here's what I'm
[59:24] going to do we come in and say Here's
[59:25] what I'm I'm here I'm here use me as you
[59:28] would have me to do it when the sisters
[59:31] sister Amber and sister Priscilla or
[59:32] even my wife are doing a fellowship if
[59:35] they leave it open to you to bring what
[59:37] you want then bring what you want but if
[59:39] they say well we need somebody to bring
[59:41] mashed potatoes then guess what don't
[59:43] say I'll bring
[59:44] carrots the Willing heart is to say
[59:47] potatoes not carrots cuz that's what we
[59:50] need is potatoes amen and watch how
[59:53] Israel responded to this it says the
[59:55] children of Israel brought a willing
[59:57] offering unto the Lord every man and
[59:59] woman whose heart made them willing to
[1:00:01] bring for all manner of work which the
[1:00:04] Lord had commanded to be made by the
[1:00:07] hand of Moses so Moses didn't accept
[1:00:09] every offering Moses only accepted that
[1:00:11] which was needed based on what the Lord
[1:00:13] had required that's the way that this
[1:00:15] works amen so we couldn't come to Moses
[1:00:18] with what we thought would work with
[1:00:20] what we thought would look good which
[1:00:22] what we thought would match his idea no
[1:00:24] he says this is what we need that's it
[1:00:27] and you either brought it or you didn't
[1:00:30] but we can't put Moses in a t position
[1:00:32] by making him turn down what we've
[1:00:34] brought because it's not on the
[1:00:36] list same thing with brother Paul and
[1:00:38] sister Kimberly same thing with sister
[1:00:39] Amber and sister Priscilla same thing
[1:00:41] with the trustees whoever's asking for
[1:00:43] help we go based on what they need not
[1:00:45] what we want if we say I need a round
[1:00:48] Peg and somebody jumps up and says hey
[1:00:50] I've got a square peg I've got a square
[1:00:51] peg pick me pick me guess what we're not
[1:00:52] going to pick the square peg because we
[1:00:54] need a round one so don't come up and
[1:00:56] say I've got a a square Pig he clearly
[1:00:59] needs a round one give him a round Peg
[1:01:00] or don't give him anything at all we see
[1:01:03] the same thing when it came to building
[1:01:04] the Temple by Solomon and watch what
[1:01:06] David says here David says moreover
[1:01:08] because I have set my affection to the
[1:01:10] house of my God and I have of my own
[1:01:13] proper good of gold and silver which I
[1:01:15] have given to the house of my God over
[1:01:17] and above all that I have prepared for
[1:01:18] the holy house so David has a bunch of
[1:01:20] things that he's gotten of himself he
[1:01:23] says even 3,000 talents of gold of the
[1:01:25] gold of of oir and 7,000 talents of
[1:01:28] refined silver to Overlay the walls of
[1:01:30] the house with all and the gold for
[1:01:32] things of gold and the silver for things
[1:01:34] of silver and for all manner of work to
[1:01:36] be made by the hands of artificers and
[1:01:39] who then is willing willing to
[1:01:42] consecrate his service this day unto the
[1:01:44] Lord David says here's what we need
[1:01:47] who's willing to
[1:01:49] give it says then the chief of the
[1:01:51] fathers of the priests of the tribes of
[1:01:53] Israel and the captains of thousands and
[1:01:55] of hundred with the rulers of the king's
[1:01:57] work offered willingly and gave for the
[1:02:00] service of the house of God of gold
[1:02:03] 5,000 talents and 10,000 drams and of
[1:02:05] silver 10,000 talents and of brass
[1:02:08] 18,000 talents and 100,000 talents of
[1:02:10] iron so the need was for all these
[1:02:13] Metals precious and otherwise and so
[1:02:16] that's what they gave and they with whom
[1:02:18] precious stones were found gave them to
[1:02:20] The Treasure of the house of the Lord by
[1:02:22] the hand of jahil the Gite ganite
[1:02:26] not everybody had precious stones but
[1:02:28] those that did gave
[1:02:30] them okay then it says then the people
[1:02:34] rejoiced for that they offered
[1:02:38] willingly because with perfect heart
[1:02:41] they offered willingly to the
[1:02:44] Lord and David the king also rejoiced
[1:02:47] with great joy so their willing heart
[1:02:50] was that they gave what was asked for
[1:02:53] not just what they felt would work amen
[1:02:56] the Willing heart is always tied to a
[1:02:58] need not just a personal desire if our
[1:03:01] desire is to meet the need that's
[1:03:04] great but if our desire is to do our own
[1:03:07] thing that's not a willing heart that's
[1:03:09] actually a selfish heart it seems weird
[1:03:12] to say it that way but it's a selfish
[1:03:13] heart because you're doing it for you
[1:03:14] not for them that's the way that these
[1:03:16] things work amen if I have a desire on
[1:03:19] my heart then I'm going in with an
[1:03:21] intent a willing heart doesn't come in
[1:03:23] with an intent except to serve to help
[1:03:26] to support to meet the
[1:03:28] need watch now Solomon comes back so
[1:03:31] David's talked here and then Solomon
[1:03:33] comes and talks and he's saying and the
[1:03:34] Lord said unto David my father whereas
[1:03:37] it was in thine heart to build an house
[1:03:39] unto my name thou did well that it was
[1:03:41] in thy heart God never goes to us and
[1:03:44] says it's wrong to have a good
[1:03:46] desire he's saying David it's good that
[1:03:49] you want to build the house of the Lord
[1:03:52] it's good to have a desire to do
[1:03:54] something good but the question we have
[1:03:56] to ask then is is that desire his will
[1:04:00] God never chastises David for having the
[1:04:02] desire but if David insisted on trying
[1:04:04] to build it chastisement would have
[1:04:06] followed amen remember what Jesus said
[1:04:10] in Matthew 7 he says in that day they're
[1:04:11] going to come to me and say did not we
[1:04:13] do this and did not we do that and we
[1:04:15] cast out demons and we healed the sick
[1:04:16] and did prophesy and did many wonderful
[1:04:18] things in your name and he says no
[1:04:20] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[1:04:22] never knew you you didn't do what I told
[1:04:24] you to do and you went and did something
[1:04:25] of your your own desire you had a desire
[1:04:27] in your heart but it wasn't according to
[1:04:29] my will you didn't check it with the
[1:04:31] word of God so God comes to David he
[1:04:33] says David you do well to want to do
[1:04:36] something good but verse 19 says
[1:04:38] nevertheless Thou shalt not build the
[1:04:43] house you w David you're not allowed to
[1:04:46] build this house it's your desire it's
[1:04:49] your idea not your job though he says
[1:04:52] but thy son that shall come forth out of
[1:04:54] thy loins he shall build the house unto
[1:04:56] my name so dropping back to David's
[1:04:59] speaking and just before Solomon started
[1:05:01] to build we're kind of going back and
[1:05:03] forth here it says now then David the
[1:05:05] king stood up upon his feet and said
[1:05:06] hear me my brethren and my people as for
[1:05:09] me I had in my heart to build an House
[1:05:11] of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:05:13] the Lord and for the foot stol of our
[1:05:15] God and had made ready for the building
[1:05:18] but God said unto me Thou shalt not
[1:05:21] build an house for my name because thou
[1:05:24] Hast been a man of war and has shed
[1:05:26] blood so why is David unsuited to build
[1:05:28] the temple he's unsuited because of the
[1:05:31] way that God made him God's purpose for
[1:05:35] David was to go and win Wars to bring
[1:05:38] the land to a time of Peace because it
[1:05:40] was a king of peace that has to build
[1:05:42] the temple not a man of blood not a king
[1:05:46] of war and bloodshed it has to be a man
[1:05:48] of Peace so David is Built For War and
[1:05:51] victory and that makes him unsuited to
[1:05:54] build the temple
[1:05:56] the way he's built is unsuited for the
[1:05:58] work that he wants to
[1:06:00] do but he's got a willing
[1:06:03] heart he's got a willing heart we'll see
[1:06:05] it's not just a desire but it's a
[1:06:06] willing heart amen and so the test of
[1:06:09] our heart is always what happens when
[1:06:11] God says
[1:06:12] no that's when we're going to find out
[1:06:15] is this me or is it him am I really
[1:06:18] serving or am I trying to drive the
[1:06:20] process somehow see David could have
[1:06:22] stomped around and got mad and said God
[1:06:25] this is the way you built me this is
[1:06:27] your doing God you made me this way and
[1:06:29] I've got a desire and now you're saying
[1:06:31] I can't do
[1:06:32] it but David didn't do that David said
[1:06:36] that's okay I'm going to help in every
[1:06:39] other way that I can so that when my son
[1:06:41] comes to build this he's got everything
[1:06:43] he needs and David did everything he got
[1:06:46] as close to the edge as he could without
[1:06:48] crossing over the word out of the desire
[1:06:51] of his heart a willing heart to do what
[1:06:54] God had asked him to do amen I have come
[1:06:57] to the realization that just because I
[1:07:00] can doesn't mean I
[1:07:03] should and I've learned that in my work
[1:07:05] I've learned it in my family I've
[1:07:07] learned it in churches and everything
[1:07:08] listen if we put our mind to it most of
[1:07:10] us can do just about
[1:07:12] anything and most of us have enough of
[1:07:15] an understanding to do just about
[1:07:17] everything but not all of us can do
[1:07:18] things well and more to the point not
[1:07:21] all of us can do things as well as those
[1:07:23] who are gifted and called
[1:07:25] amen so we've got to make sure that
[1:07:27] we're in the place that we're supposed
[1:07:29] to and there are things frankly where if
[1:07:31] I get involved they go downhill not
[1:07:33] uphill they get worse not better and
[1:07:36] I'll give you some examples amen I might
[1:07:38] have a desire to help but my help is not
[1:07:41] going to make things any better I have a
[1:07:43] way of talking I have a way of
[1:07:44] responding I have a way of planning I
[1:07:46] have a way of laying things out I'm a
[1:07:48] pretty black and white person as most of
[1:07:49] you know and when I set things in motion
[1:07:52] it's going to be my way or the highway
[1:07:54] and some people can work with me and
[1:07:56] some people
[1:07:58] can't amen that's good when people are
[1:08:01] in agreement with me but it's not so
[1:08:03] good when people are in disagreement
[1:08:04] with me now if we flip those tables and
[1:08:07] somebody else is in charge and I come
[1:08:09] along and I think they're not doing
[1:08:11] something the way it ought to be done
[1:08:14] that's a test of am I there with a
[1:08:15] willing heart or am I there trying to
[1:08:18] lead because if I'm not there can only
[1:08:20] be one leader and if I'm not the leader
[1:08:23] I have to subject myself to them whether
[1:08:26] they're wrong or right as long as it's
[1:08:28] not a word issue you understand what I'm
[1:08:29] saying
[1:08:30] amen that's when we're going to find out
[1:08:32] if brother John has a Personal Agenda or
[1:08:35] if he's there with a willing heart is
[1:08:37] what happens when I'm there and
[1:08:39] something happens that I don't agree
[1:08:41] with and listen sometimes when that's
[1:08:43] happened I've had to humble myself and
[1:08:46] let it go and that person had to learn
[1:08:49] that they were wrong but guess what
[1:08:52] sometimes it worked out that brother
[1:08:53] John had to realize hey I was
[1:08:56] wrong humility goes a long ways Church
[1:09:00] it keeps us in the right attitude Moses
[1:09:02] had a desire in his heart and a call of
[1:09:04] God to deliver the children of Israel
[1:09:05] and we know how much trouble that got
[1:09:07] him into because he tried to do it of
[1:09:10] his own strength and we know that God
[1:09:11] took him out on the backside of the
[1:09:13] desert for 40 years and he beat that
[1:09:15] desire out of Moses when God finally
[1:09:17] called Moses Moses wanted nothing to do
[1:09:20] with deliverance and that's exactly
[1:09:23] where God wants us that's exactly where
[1:09:24] God wants us
[1:09:26] but we're talking about a willing heart
[1:09:27] just for this next little bit listen to
[1:09:29] this this is Moses coming up to the to
[1:09:32] the the burning bush it says Moses Drew
[1:09:34] up with a willing heart to
[1:09:37] understand Moses didn't come up with an
[1:09:39] idea an agenda or a plan Moses came up
[1:09:42] wanting to understand and God spoke to
[1:09:45] Moses and said take off your shoes for
[1:09:47] the ground that you stand on is Holy
[1:09:48] Ground Moses removed his shoes and God
[1:09:51] talked to Moses Moses learned more in 5
[1:09:54] minutes time in the presence of that
[1:09:56] fire than he had learned in 40 years of
[1:09:58] education he knew more about God with 5
[1:10:01] minutes in the presence of that light
[1:10:03] that he did in 40 Years of studying and
[1:10:06] schooling see the Willing heart comes in
[1:10:09] and it's open willing to learn willing
[1:10:12] to be led willing to be taught willing
[1:10:14] to be shown then he says this he says
[1:10:17] now if you have a mind and not a selfish
[1:10:20] mind but a willing heart to learn the
[1:10:23] holy spirit will teach you these things
[1:10:26] so a willing heart it leads us to a
[1:10:28] place of seeking to understand to obey
[1:10:32] and to follow not to drive lead and push
[1:10:36] that's what a willing heart looks like
[1:10:38] amen it's a it's a heart that's willing
[1:10:40] to be placed willing to be used
[1:10:42] according to need it's one that's
[1:10:44] subject to the needs of the body not
[1:10:46] subject to our own heart's desires okay
[1:10:49] no matter how spiritual we make it so we
[1:10:52] can spiritualize our desires all day
[1:10:54] long remember I told you that
[1:10:56] story of that sister in our
[1:10:59] church back in Texas and she she just
[1:11:02] brought in an organ and she wanted to
[1:11:03] play the
[1:11:04] organ she had a desire in her heart to
[1:11:08] help with
[1:11:09] worship but she couldn't
[1:11:12] play but you when when I went to talk to
[1:11:14] her remember what she said my daddy had
[1:11:16] a dream that I was in the church playing
[1:11:19] and this is the Fulfillment of that
[1:11:21] dream therefore I must be allowed to
[1:11:24] play see she had had a desire in her
[1:11:26] heart to play and she spiritualized it
[1:11:29] based on a dream her father had and so
[1:11:31] therefore we had to acquest to that and
[1:11:34] the answer was no you don't have a gift
[1:11:37] you're interfering with the music you're
[1:11:38] interfering with the worship which
[1:11:40] interferes with the service setting
[1:11:41] itself up you can't do it but see we can
[1:11:44] spiritualize our desires because they're
[1:11:47] good but they're good doesn't mean
[1:11:49] they're right and it doesn't mean it's
[1:11:51] God's will in our life okay that's it
[1:11:56] that's that's our start for this morning
[1:11:57] but I just felt to drop that in because
[1:11:59] we're talking about the body we're
[1:12:00] talking about finding our place and
[1:12:02] we've got to make sure that our will is
[1:12:05] according to his desire not just our own
[1:12:08] amen we go back to our original
[1:12:10] scripture we're speaking again on
[1:12:11] finding your place and accepting your
[1:12:13] part he says except the Lord build the
[1:12:15] house they labor in vain that build it
[1:12:18] except the Lord keep the city the
[1:12:19] Watchman worketh but in vain so the
[1:12:22] temple is the of the Living God is what
[1:12:24] it's the body Christ it's the bride of
[1:12:26] Christ and we see here that it takes God
[1:12:28] to prepare a place for his dwelling it
[1:12:31] takes God to do it it's a placing it's a
[1:12:34] positioning of the Holy Spirit and if we
[1:12:36] have the same Spirit we will find our
[1:12:39] place and will be content in our
[1:12:42] position if we've got the Holy Spirit
[1:12:44] and we've come into where he wants us
[1:12:46] rather than what we want so we're going
[1:12:48] to go back to 1 Corinthians 12 this
[1:12:50] morning where we finished last service
[1:12:52] and Paul said for as the body is one and
[1:12:54] had many members and all the members of
[1:12:56] that one body being many are one body so
[1:13:00] also is Christ and he says for by one
[1:13:02] Spirit are we all baptized into one body
[1:13:06] I've said it before I will keep saying
[1:13:07] it if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:13:10] you're not going to be able to fit into
[1:13:11] a body of real Believers it's going to
[1:13:13] take the Holy Spirit to unify us amen he
[1:13:17] says whether we be Jews or Gentiles Bond
[1:13:19] or free we have all been made to drink
[1:13:21] into one spirit so he says for the body
[1:13:24] is not one man M but many so we look at
[1:13:27] our natural bodies if I was to Stand
[1:13:28] Here you'd say how many parts do you
[1:13:30] have well just we've got you know we've
[1:13:32] got our extremities of our of our for
[1:13:34] limbs we've got our head we've got our
[1:13:35] torso and these different things but
[1:13:37] then we have all the things that are
[1:13:38] hidden as well we've got external
[1:13:40] members and internal members and the
[1:13:43] smallest things it's funny because they
[1:13:45] didn't really know a whole lot about the
[1:13:46] body in these times but the smallest
[1:13:48] things in your body are the things that
[1:13:50] maintain your health but it takes every
[1:13:53] single thing there you even look at your
[1:13:55] hands you say well I'm a hand and he's a
[1:13:57] hand yeah but you're not both the same
[1:13:59] hand you're
[1:14:00] mirrors left hand and right hand are not
[1:14:03] the same they have the same number of
[1:14:04] fingers but this hand and this hand are
[1:14:06] not the same
[1:14:07] see that's the only way you can make
[1:14:09] them the same but then it's not the same
[1:14:11] because one's backwards the other one's
[1:14:12] frontwards and guess what this hand on
[1:14:14] me is bigger than this one because I'm
[1:14:16] right hand dominant so even if you're a
[1:14:19] hand and I'm a hand if you're the right
[1:14:20] hand and I'm the left that means you're
[1:14:22] the dominant hand that means even as a
[1:14:24] hand are things you do better than I do
[1:14:26] even though I'm a hand listen we have in
[1:14:29] the church we have leads and we have
[1:14:31] backups don't we we have brother Bob
[1:14:33] leads a song service well if he can't
[1:14:36] make it then who is it now we lost
[1:14:38] brother Josh unfortunately so now we've
[1:14:40] got brother Joe that'll come up and if
[1:14:42] brother Joe doesn't take it then brother
[1:14:44] Mark takes
[1:14:45] it we've got the same thing for
[1:14:47] musicians if Sister Morin's not here
[1:14:49] then sister Priscilla steps in if Sister
[1:14:51] Priscilla is not here nobody
[1:14:53] plays right
[1:14:56] but I can guarantee you sister Priscilla
[1:14:58] doesn't think she's the lead piano
[1:15:00] player nor does she presume to be in
[1:15:02] that position why sister moren's the
[1:15:05] strong right hand for now and sister
[1:15:07] Priscilla is the backup and that's okay
[1:15:11] she's in her position they're both in
[1:15:13] their position amen it's okay to be a
[1:15:16] backup until you come into the dominant
[1:15:18] or primary position that's how you get
[1:15:20] to the first chair remember in the
[1:15:23] orchestra you got the first chair
[1:15:25] violinist they lead the whole Orchestra
[1:15:27] after the after the conductor don't they
[1:15:29] when you go in to the arts and culture
[1:15:31] center to watch uh a symphony play who
[1:15:33] gets up it's the first chair it's the
[1:15:35] lead violinist that gets everybody in
[1:15:37] tune and in order but guess what to get
[1:15:39] to the first chair you got to go through
[1:15:41] fourth chair third chair check second
[1:15:43] chair and first chair and it's all based
[1:15:45] on Merit it's based on how well you
[1:15:47] do same thing with the body he says now
[1:15:50] if the foot shall say because I am not
[1:15:52] the hand I am not of the body is it
[1:15:55] therefore not of the body and if the ear
[1:15:57] shall say because I am not the eye I am
[1:15:59] not of the body is it therefore not of
[1:16:02] the body see we all have things we like
[1:16:04] and appreciate and unfortunately our
[1:16:06] human nature is to like what other
[1:16:07] people have rather than what we
[1:16:11] have it's just the way we are you look
[1:16:14] at you you have your the sisters and
[1:16:17] they'll look at a sister oh she's got
[1:16:18] the greatest
[1:16:20] hair yeah but she's heavier than you
[1:16:23] yeah she's got a a perfect nose yeah but
[1:16:26] she's got a double chin see they'll
[1:16:28] focus on what she has without the things
[1:16:30] that she that are good and not the
[1:16:32] things that are so
[1:16:34] great well she can cook so well yeah but
[1:16:37] you can clean like nobody's business
[1:16:39] everybody's got something that's
[1:16:41] wonderful and great about them but we
[1:16:42] tend to focus on what's not great on us
[1:16:44] that the other person has because we all
[1:16:46] want to be the perfect
[1:16:48] human and Paul's saying listen if you
[1:16:50] say well because I'm not like brother
[1:16:52] Chad I'm not a part of this body he says
[1:16:54] is that really true no it's not true but
[1:16:58] he's saying watch your attitude because
[1:17:01] you'll put yourself out before anybody
[1:17:03] else does because you think I'm not as
[1:17:05] good as them or I'm not as noticeable as
[1:17:07] them or I don't do this or I don't do
[1:17:08] that or I don't have no he's saying
[1:17:10] you're here because you're a part of the
[1:17:12] body and you have a purpose and you have
[1:17:14] a place
[1:17:15] amen don't let
[1:17:18] comparisons put us out of the body of
[1:17:21] Christ and and he says here's why he
[1:17:24] says if the the whole body was an eye
[1:17:26] then where's the hearing and if the
[1:17:28] whole body were hearing where is the
[1:17:30] smelling if we're all the same we're
[1:17:32] going to be a pretty ugly
[1:17:35] body it's a horrible thing it'd be a
[1:17:39] modern day
[1:17:41] Frankenstein 17
[1:17:44] arms no that's not the way that it works
[1:17:48] if all we can do is see but we can't
[1:17:50] hear yes we might be alive but we're not
[1:17:52] functioning and if all we can do is hear
[1:17:54] but we can't can't smell then we are of
[1:17:56] all men most miserable you can't taste
[1:17:58] without your
[1:17:59] smell right we need every part to be in
[1:18:03] its place and working and he confirms it
[1:18:05] he says but now hath God set the
[1:18:07] members every one of them in the
[1:18:12] body how as it has pleased him some of
[1:18:17] you are here by chance nope every one of
[1:18:23] them I don't play any part every one of
[1:18:28] them I don't see what value I bring as
[1:18:31] it has pleased
[1:18:33] him you're pleasing to him and you have
[1:18:36] value based on him that's why he's put
[1:18:38] you there amen every single person it
[1:18:41] says has set has appointed placed and
[1:18:45] established and fixed you where you are
[1:18:48] for purpose remember this scripture we
[1:18:50] read a little bit earlier Peter said ye
[1:18:52] also as Lively Stones as living stones
[1:18:55] are built up a spiritual house a holy
[1:18:57] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:18:59] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:19:02] Christ and ye are a chosen generation a
[1:19:05] royal priesthood a holy nation of
[1:19:07] peculiar people why that you should show
[1:19:10] forth the Praises of him who has called
[1:19:12] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[1:19:15] Light the purpose of a living stone is
[1:19:18] to show the Praises of God is to show a
[1:19:21] difference between what you were and
[1:19:23] what you are and the refence is him his
[1:19:26] work his Spirit not just talk about it
[1:19:29] show it remember what Moses got Moses
[1:19:32] got stone tablets that were dead now God
[1:19:36] has living tablets living tablets that
[1:19:39] are the exact same word showing that the
[1:19:42] power of the Spirit by the word can
[1:19:44] produce a word image again that's what
[1:19:46] he's doing it's living tablets but I
[1:19:49] want to take you back to how those
[1:19:50] stones were prepared we're talking about
[1:19:52] the body of Christ and it's a temple
[1:19:55] that the scripture tells us and if we go
[1:19:57] back to how the stones were were
[1:19:58] prepared in Solomon's time it says and
[1:20:00] the King commanded and they brought
[1:20:02] great Stones big Stones large Stones I
[1:20:05] did some research on this because you
[1:20:07] can go today to the Temple Mount and you
[1:20:08] can see the original Stones 3,000 years
[1:20:11] old and the biggest ones are they they
[1:20:14] say that I saw two estimates between 40
[1:20:18] and 44t long that's a big Stone Church
[1:20:22] that's about twice as long as our
[1:20:24] longest pew
[1:20:25] almost and the biggest ones weigh over a
[1:20:28] million
[1:20:30] pound a million pound of stone one stone
[1:20:35] so he says they have great Stones they
[1:20:37] have costly Stones this means rare
[1:20:40] precious or expensive and they have huge
[1:20:43] Stones so these are stones that are
[1:20:45] crafted and sized for their details and
[1:20:47] features and at that time they were only
[1:20:50] used for expensive or important
[1:20:52] structures because nobody could afford
[1:20:54] to have every stone perfectly
[1:20:57] cut but I want to stop here because we
[1:20:59] look at that and we say well brother
[1:21:00] John there's three types of stones
[1:21:01] there's a great Stone a costly stone and
[1:21:03] a huge Stone that's not what it says and
[1:21:05] we know that by observation when we go
[1:21:07] to the Temple Mount we see that some are
[1:21:09] bigger and some are smaller so not all
[1:21:12] are
[1:21:13] great okay not all are great but when
[1:21:16] you go every single one of them is
[1:21:19] costly every one of them is of Great
[1:21:22] Value because every sing single Stone on
[1:21:25] the temple is hued every single one is
[1:21:29] shaped for its purpose without exception
[1:21:34] without exception amen every single
[1:21:37] Stone there was hu it says in verse 18
[1:21:39] and Solomon's Builders and Ham's
[1:21:40] Builders did heue them and the stone
[1:21:42] squares so they prepared Timber and
[1:21:44] stones to build the house so every
[1:21:47] single Stone in that Temple had to be
[1:21:49] hued it had to be shaped it had to be
[1:21:51] cut it had to be fitted can I say this
[1:21:54] way no stone was Naturally Fit for the
[1:21:59] temple none of us can fit into the body
[1:22:03] of Christ in our original Natural State
[1:22:07] not a single one amen you cannot be put
[1:22:10] into the temple of God without the
[1:22:12] master Craftsman working on you
[1:22:15] impossible impossible amen you cannot be
[1:22:18] a part of the body of Christ without
[1:22:19] some molding and some shaping in your
[1:22:21] life you cannot fit together with the
[1:22:23] people of God God unless you've gone
[1:22:25] through the same process they've gone
[1:22:27] through that's what it's going to take
[1:22:28] amen you might have the raw gifts the
[1:22:30] raw talents the raw personality the raw
[1:22:33] strength the wrong the raw Charisma we
[1:22:35] talked about everything that you need is
[1:22:38] there but in your original condition you
[1:22:41] are not fit for the temple of God you
[1:22:44] might have the right stuff but you've
[1:22:45] got to be submitted to the master
[1:22:47] Craftsman's tools amen you cannot enter
[1:22:51] this body on the merits of your own you
[1:22:53] have to be touched
[1:22:55] by the master Craftsman it says in verse
[1:22:58] or in the in the next chapter it says
[1:23:00] and the house this is the temple when it
[1:23:03] was in building was built of stone made
[1:23:07] ready
[1:23:09] before before it was brought thither so
[1:23:13] that there was neither Hammer nor axe
[1:23:15] nor any tool of iron heard in the house
[1:23:18] while it was building church you can be
[1:23:20] in church church you can be in church
[1:23:21] all your life you can be raised in a
[1:23:23] Christian home can come from the the
[1:23:25] best of the
[1:23:26] best but you can't enter this body of
[1:23:29] Believers until you've gone through the
[1:23:32] process of Christ working in your life
[1:23:35] you cannot do it amen listen some of us
[1:23:38] take longer than others some of us take
[1:23:40] longer because we resist and some of us
[1:23:43] take longer because we've got a bigger
[1:23:45] job and God's got to make sure that your
[1:23:48] character is ready to handle the load
[1:23:50] that's about to be placed on you
[1:23:53] amen but we all need that Master
[1:23:55] Craftsman we've all got our odd angles
[1:23:58] our little bumps and protrusions we've
[1:24:01] all got our
[1:24:02] imperfections and listen we may look
[1:24:05] perfect but we are not perfect when
[1:24:07] we're compared to where we have to
[1:24:11] fit because he's got a plan he's got a
[1:24:14] master template he's got a design that's
[1:24:16] laid out and you've got to fit that and
[1:24:19] that's going to take some work listen to
[1:24:21] this he says God gave you the Holy Ghost
[1:24:25] with your
[1:24:26] peculiarities God gave me the Holy Ghost
[1:24:29] with my peculiarities and God gives
[1:24:31] those the Holy Ghost who obeyed him now
[1:24:34] who obeyed him who children of his he
[1:24:37] says see there you are we just draw
[1:24:38] these little straws and things and
[1:24:40] that's what the devil wants Church what
[1:24:42] did they straw draw straws for to assign
[1:24:47] guilt who's the problem remember when
[1:24:50] they had an issue with uh at AI when
[1:24:53] Joshua went there they just destroyed
[1:24:55] Jericho a wonderful Supernatural Victory
[1:24:57] then they go to AI Joshua doesn't check
[1:25:00] up with the Lord he just sends a few men
[1:25:01] over cuz it's a small town will beat
[1:25:03] them easily and they lost 36 men if I
[1:25:05] remember and they said we've got to
[1:25:06] figure out who the problem is and they
[1:25:09] drew lots and then it went down and God
[1:25:12] supernaturally F LED it all the way down
[1:25:14] to the person that was at fault which
[1:25:15] was Ain he says you know what we do we
[1:25:17] sit here and we draw
[1:25:20] straws oh it's her fault because she's
[1:25:22] this way oh it's his fault because he's
[1:25:24] that way it's her fault because she
[1:25:26] didn't do this it's his fault because he
[1:25:27] did that he says no no no no no no
[1:25:30] that's not the way the church
[1:25:32] Works he says that's what the devil
[1:25:34] wants but I believe my brethren that
[1:25:37] there is coming an hour when a real rank
[1:25:40] persecution will run us together then we
[1:25:42] will be one the church will come
[1:25:44] together he says I believe it's all in
[1:25:46] the making of God after painting this
[1:25:48] picture to you when Solomon's Temple was
[1:25:51] built it was cut out all over the world
[1:25:56] and one block was saw this way and one
[1:25:59] that way but when they came together
[1:26:01] every stone went to its place without
[1:26:05] the sound of a hammer or the buzz of a
[1:26:07] saw he says and it was the Church of the
[1:26:11] Living God okay catch that thought
[1:26:14] because the stones were perfected before
[1:26:17] they were
[1:26:19] placed so if we're in a
[1:26:22] situation and we keep
[1:26:24] causing friction somebody's not shaped
[1:26:29] right
[1:26:30] okay if I can't fit next to you then one
[1:26:34] of us is out or both of us is
[1:26:37] out we've got to be able to what see
[1:26:40] that we're in position perfectly and if
[1:26:43] there's friction we've got to go back
[1:26:45] out and let the Craftsman work on us a
[1:26:46] little bit more that's what it's going
[1:26:48] to take amen but all the temple work it
[1:26:51] was silent in terms of striking and
[1:26:54] shaping tools there was none on site if
[1:26:57] they went and they put it in and it
[1:26:59] didn't fit perfect they took it right
[1:27:01] back out of the temple work site and
[1:27:03] they took it back and they finished the
[1:27:04] work and then they brought it in and
[1:27:05] test fitted it again and if it was
[1:27:07] perfect they left it if it wasn't they
[1:27:09] did back and forth back and forth that's
[1:27:10] why it took so long it had to be perfect
[1:27:12] for every single one of them by the time
[1:27:14] they got there the stones were silent
[1:27:18] the stones were
[1:27:19] perfect listen to this every man that
[1:27:22] comes to Christ must first be child
[1:27:24] trained for the purpose that God has
[1:27:26] ordained you for and remember he says if
[1:27:30] you can just keep
[1:27:34] quiet what is it we resist his plan we
[1:27:38] resist his idea that ain't going to work
[1:27:40] I don't want to do it I don't like it
[1:27:42] that way I want my way I never
[1:27:45] envisioned myself
[1:27:47] here I don't want to be here doesn't
[1:27:51] matter you're the stone he's the master
[1:27:54] Mr Craftsman he says just keep quiet let
[1:27:56] him do the work he knows the plan he
[1:27:59] knows the vision remember if he has
[1:28:01] called you for this there is nothing can
[1:28:04] keep it from happening there are not
[1:28:06] enough devils in torment but what God's
[1:28:08] word will be made manifest you're born
[1:28:10] for a purpose and nobody can take your
[1:28:13] place you might have impersonators and
[1:28:16] everything else but they'll never take
[1:28:19] your place that means we don't have to
[1:28:21] fight for position
[1:28:24] because God has a place ordained for you
[1:28:27] and only you can fit it somebody else
[1:28:30] may impersonate you somebody else may
[1:28:32] say well that's my spot but if God has
[1:28:34] ordained you for it he'll get you there
[1:28:36] and he'll make sure they're moved out in
[1:28:38] time
[1:28:39] amen he says you might have
[1:28:42] impersonators and everything else but
[1:28:43] they'll never take your place why God's
[1:28:46] word will Triumph it cannot fail there
[1:28:49] is where every Christian ought to stand
[1:28:51] knowing that and trials will come up and
[1:28:54] seem every way to you but remember God
[1:28:57] has a purpose and it will work out it
[1:28:59] will all work right I was listening to
[1:29:03] uh uh spoken words The Original Seed
[1:29:05] this morning and he was talking about
[1:29:06] how we were made in His image and he
[1:29:08] says he says when when when what is he
[1:29:11] says what is God he says God is the
[1:29:14] word he said and he said we in the
[1:29:16] beginning he said let us make man in our
[1:29:18] image he says what were we made in we
[1:29:19] were made in a word image it was
[1:29:23] reflective of the thoughts and
[1:29:24] intentions of God it was pure deity
[1:29:28] coming into reality it was a very part
[1:29:32] of God Amen and so what happens now is
[1:29:35] that we are born not in a a a word image
[1:29:38] in a god image we're born in man's image
[1:29:41] and so we come to this world and we've
[1:29:44] got a man's image but we need a new
[1:29:45] birth so we can be born into a word
[1:29:48] image and that's where we get the new
[1:29:49] heart and the new spirit that can get
[1:29:51] along with his spirit so he can pour it
[1:29:53] into us and changes from what man has
[1:29:55] made us into what God has determined for
[1:29:58] us that's what the new birth is supposed
[1:30:00] to do amen the new word the Holy Spirit
[1:30:02] brings the word image that was eternal
[1:30:05] from the thoughts of Mind thoughts of
[1:30:06] God's mind into reality amen and I was
[1:30:10] amazed as I was studying this that the
[1:30:12] the the the temple that Solomon built is
[1:30:15] 100% dry construction just like the
[1:30:19] pyramids there is no mortar in the
[1:30:22] temple everything is perfectly fit they
[1:30:26] don't need anything to bind them and
[1:30:27] hold them why because they've been
[1:30:30] placed by the
[1:30:32] spirit amen they've been placed by the
[1:30:35] spirit each one of them is set perfectly
[1:30:37] and 3,000 years after we can go there
[1:30:40] and you can't fit a razor blade between
[1:30:42] them they are that
[1:30:45] perfect that's what God's trying to do
[1:30:47] here amen the strength of the stone is
[1:30:52] not in the Stone it's in its preparation
[1:30:55] and fit for where it goes because if you
[1:30:59] take a stone structure and you leave any
[1:31:01] sort of slot brother Matt Aaron may have
[1:31:03] shown you his garage Aaron James he's
[1:31:05] got a garage and it's got It's Made of
[1:31:08] uh uh concrete
[1:31:10] bricks well guess what it's starting to
[1:31:13] pull because it used mortar and it was
[1:31:17] imperfectly
[1:31:18] done and so he's got this little fine
[1:31:20] Gap going right through the wall of his
[1:31:21] garage you'd think it's a Concrete
[1:31:23] structure it shouldn't no it has pulled
[1:31:25] apart why it was imperfectly
[1:31:28] fitted but when you go to the temple
[1:31:31] it's perfectly fitted and nothing moves
[1:31:33] the strength is not in the stone itself
[1:31:35] it's how it's put together and if you
[1:31:37] leave any bit of slop There When Trials
[1:31:40] come when earthquakes come when hard
[1:31:43] times come what happens those stones
[1:31:45] will move and they'll start to pull and
[1:31:48] then eventually something will get to a
[1:31:50] place where it's got a big enough Gap
[1:31:52] that it'll just snap in the middle
[1:31:56] it takes the hand of God to set us to
[1:32:00] where we can stand whatever comes our
[1:32:02] way and not move out of
[1:32:06] position that takes the hand of God Amen
[1:32:08] that takes the preparation of God that
[1:32:10] means god builds us to handle certain
[1:32:12] things you know they have what's called
[1:32:14] a keystone if you go look at some of
[1:32:17] these older churches and that they have
[1:32:18] these great um
[1:32:20] arches and the key to an arch is always
[1:32:22] the Keystone that they drop in at the
[1:32:24] top and it equalizes the force going in
[1:32:26] either direction so that the the arch
[1:32:28] doesn't cave in on
[1:32:29] itself but you got to cut that stone
[1:32:31] just at the right
[1:32:33] angle otherwise it all falls apart
[1:32:35] they've got to support that Arch until
[1:32:37] the Keystone drops in and as soon as
[1:32:38] that Keystone drops in that structure is
[1:32:40] self
[1:32:42] self-supporting but that Keystone has to
[1:32:44] be perfect because if it's tapered just
[1:32:46] a little bit it'll push it back if it's
[1:32:48] tapered this way it'll push it forward
[1:32:49] and it'll fail over time it has to be
[1:32:51] perfectly square perfectly straight
[1:32:53] perfect ly
[1:32:55] angled amen we can't make ourselves what
[1:33:00] we ought to be it takes him to do it
[1:33:02] takes him to place us we can't make
[1:33:05] ourselves gifted if we're not we can't
[1:33:07] make ourselves strong in a way that
[1:33:09] we're not intended to be strong in amen
[1:33:11] we can not we can't change our strengths
[1:33:13] and
[1:33:14] weaknesses God can change us but I can't
[1:33:17] change
[1:33:18] myself same thing within the church we
[1:33:21] can't make ourselves what we aren't we
[1:33:22] can't declare ourselves to have
[1:33:24] something that we don't have amen
[1:33:25] certain positions in this church based
[1:33:28] on the scriptures alone have certain
[1:33:30] requirements and we can't change those
[1:33:32] some things require time to develop
[1:33:34] improve and other things are dependent
[1:33:35] on the absolutes of scripture we can't
[1:33:37] have deacons that are single because the
[1:33:39] scripture says he's supposed to be the
[1:33:40] husband of one wife and have his family
[1:33:42] in order his household in order you
[1:33:43] can't be single and be a deacon that's a
[1:33:45] scriptural absolute same thing for a
[1:33:47] pastor cuz his first church is his
[1:33:49] family if you can't prove him by his
[1:33:50] family how can he be over the household
[1:33:52] of God the family of God you can't do it
[1:33:54] you can be the most spiritual woman in
[1:33:56] this church but you still can't be a
[1:33:57] preacher the scripture declares you
[1:34:00] can't do it amen those are absolute
[1:34:03] requirements but then we also have what
[1:34:05] we would call soft skill requirements
[1:34:07] you'll see this in jobs where you might
[1:34:09] be an engineer but if you're going to be
[1:34:10] the lead engineer you got to be able to
[1:34:12] work with people you've got to be able
[1:34:13] to communicate and if you can't do that
[1:34:15] you can't be a lead
[1:34:17] engineer and so those things are not
[1:34:20] absolute from a scriptural standpoint
[1:34:21] but there's a practical standpoint that
[1:34:23] comes through and we've got to look at
[1:34:25] that and I'll use myself as an example
[1:34:27] when it comes to Artistic things like
[1:34:29] music or drawing or creative aspects I'm
[1:34:31] not strong there I can copy really well
[1:34:34] I won um drawing contests when I was
[1:34:37] younger by copying things and blending
[1:34:39] them together to make up my own creation
[1:34:41] but I had to have somebody else's work
[1:34:44] to be
[1:34:45] perfect you catch that I can't come up
[1:34:48] with it myself but I can take what they
[1:34:50] do and I can mimic it very very
[1:34:52] well okay so I can't come up with those
[1:34:54] things so if it's coming to music or
[1:34:57] plays or these sorts of things I'm no
[1:34:59] good at that and we have sister
[1:35:00] Priscilla that does that in the church
[1:35:02] but if you want somebody to schedule the
[1:35:04] practices make sure everybody's on time
[1:35:06] make sure that they've learned their
[1:35:07] lines make sure everybody's behaving
[1:35:09] make sure we've got the music and the
[1:35:10] and the the sound all ready to go I'm
[1:35:12] your guy I can do that but I'm not here
[1:35:15] to create plays because that's not my
[1:35:17] gift and so what sister Priscilla does
[1:35:19] is she comes up with a play and then she
[1:35:22] sends it over to me and says is this
[1:35:26] okay and then what do I do I do a quick
[1:35:28] review over it and then I give her I may
[1:35:30] give her a couple pointers but generally
[1:35:32] it's okay and I don't mess with the
[1:35:34] concept because that's not my
[1:35:37] strength that's not my strength amen my
[1:35:39] ability to criticize her work cannot be
[1:35:42] my
[1:35:43] strength amen I'm here to help adjust
[1:35:46] maybe we have correction and these
[1:35:48] different things at times but my gift is
[1:35:50] supposed to edify her not crucify her
[1:35:54] me gifts of tearing down don't exist in
[1:35:56] the church that's reserved for prophets
[1:35:59] with thus sayeth the Lord that's who can
[1:36:01] tear down is a prophet that has a direct
[1:36:03] word from God to set a situation right
[1:36:06] amen we're here to provide something to
[1:36:08] support something not to take away from
[1:36:11] itam says it this way he says your
[1:36:13] position in Christ is revealed to you by
[1:36:15] the Holy Spirit and then if you want to
[1:36:18] know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not
[1:36:19] find out whether He blesses what you're
[1:36:21] doing or not if he blesses it then
[1:36:24] that's him but count he doesn't say it
[1:36:27] here but let me add this in If He
[1:36:28] blesses it in a way that the word says
[1:36:31] is a
[1:36:32] blessing got to be very careful
[1:36:34] otherwise we'll go right into what
[1:36:36] Prosperity Doctrine oh now I got money
[1:36:39] it's God blessing it no no no no no no
[1:36:42] are you blessed in your spirit are you
[1:36:44] blessed in your soul cuz that's where he
[1:36:47] wants to bless you before you are
[1:36:49] blessed in body and
[1:36:50] finances right he says Satan if he can
[1:36:54] just get somebody to act like that and
[1:36:57] then deceive them that's just what he
[1:36:58] wants to do then the whole world points
[1:37:00] their finger right there because what
[1:37:02] happens if somebody doesn't have it and
[1:37:04] then they go and do it and they fail the
[1:37:06] world points and says see that's what
[1:37:07] Christianity is all about failed people
[1:37:11] listen we all we're all going to fail
[1:37:12] don't think that because you have a gift
[1:37:13] you won't ever fail but the point is
[1:37:15] they'll fail because they weren't
[1:37:17] supposed to be doing it they weren't
[1:37:19] called to be there he says and somebody
[1:37:21] thinks they have a gift of speaking in
[1:37:23] tongues an interpretation some has a
[1:37:25] gift of Divine Healing some has these
[1:37:27] things like now will catch this he says
[1:37:31] sometimes they're mistaken in those
[1:37:32] things
[1:37:33] see sometimes we think we've got
[1:37:35] something and we don't have it but then
[1:37:38] he says and sometimes they think they
[1:37:39] haven't got it when they have and you
[1:37:40] say well where does that leave
[1:37:43] me sometimes you do and sometimes you
[1:37:45] don't not helping us much
[1:37:47] here he says so it's very tricky and it
[1:37:50] sure is isn't it if you're seeking to
[1:37:53] find your place in the will of God it
[1:37:54] can be very tricky because you can get
[1:37:56] all sorts of open doors or open Windows
[1:38:01] you can have a dream you can have a
[1:38:02] moment and you can say that's it that's
[1:38:04] it but watch what he says here so always
[1:38:06] do this Brethren whenever you feel that
[1:38:08] you're supposed to do a thing first find
[1:38:11] out if it's scriptural for you to do it
[1:38:13] and by that he means if it's in the
[1:38:15] scriptures he says not just wrote in one
[1:38:18] place but I mean completely scriptural
[1:38:20] Through the Bible for you to do it your
[1:38:23] position say if you be an evangelist
[1:38:25] Pastor teacher Prophet whatever God
[1:38:27] might have called you to be you see or
[1:38:29] if you have the gift of tongues gift of
[1:38:30] interpretation gift of any kind of the
[1:38:32] nine spiritual gifts in the church and
[1:38:34] the four spiritual offices of the church
[1:38:36] any position first see if God called
[1:38:39] like I said if you're a woman and you
[1:38:40] say I feel God has called me to be a
[1:38:43] pastor nowhere not allowed can't do it
[1:38:47] that ain't God leading you that's a
[1:38:48] spirit just not the Holy
[1:38:50] One because the word is s and contrary
[1:38:53] to the Holy Spirit can't do it so he
[1:38:56] says check it with the word that's that
[1:38:58] ought to be the first thing we do Church
[1:39:00] check it with the word but then he says
[1:39:04] then usually I watch the nature of the
[1:39:09] person and see what kind of a gift that
[1:39:11] they're professing he's saying I'm
[1:39:13] comparing their nature to their gift and
[1:39:16] are they
[1:39:17] compatible he says see God will work
[1:39:19] with his creature the way he's made him
[1:39:22] oh
[1:39:24] oh soft skills matter nature matters
[1:39:29] attitude matters mindset matters all
[1:39:32] these things matter he says see and he's
[1:39:34] talking about a man he says now see him
[1:39:36] see him real flighty and going on and he
[1:39:37] says the Lord called me for such and
[1:39:39] such to be a pastor he says now a pastor
[1:39:42] can't be a flighty person a pastor's
[1:39:44] solid sound see God called me to be a
[1:39:47] teacher and watch him how he interprets
[1:39:49] the words see if he gets it all mixed up
[1:39:51] in everything then you can tell
[1:39:54] then he says these words but then the
[1:39:56] thing to do your position is usually
[1:39:59] known by whether you can do it or
[1:40:03] not now that's very practical can you do
[1:40:07] it or can't you are you effective in it
[1:40:11] if we look at it from the stone analogy
[1:40:12] we've been talking about do you fit or
[1:40:16] are you forcing your way is there
[1:40:19] friction when you do it or is it just a
[1:40:23] natural thing where you slide right in
[1:40:24] right next to your brother or your
[1:40:26] sister
[1:40:27] amen does everyone else have to
[1:40:31] change for you to do your
[1:40:34] thing because that can't be God's will
[1:40:37] because they're supposed to stay in
[1:40:38] their Lane you're supposed to stay in
[1:40:39] yours if everyone has to change so that
[1:40:41] I can be the pastor I shouldn't be the
[1:40:45] pastor amen notice how he F focuses here
[1:40:49] on
[1:40:50] nature not just skill
[1:40:54] because the nature is what's going to
[1:40:55] determine how well we work with the
[1:40:57] person next to us if our nature is
[1:41:00] wrong then our skill won't
[1:41:03] matter amen he talks about a pastor and
[1:41:06] if the man is flighty he can't be a
[1:41:07] pastor he doesn't say that man doesn't
[1:41:09] know the word of God he doesn't say that
[1:41:11] man doesn't have the Holy Spirit he
[1:41:13] doesn't say that man can't preach he
[1:41:14] doesn't say that man isn't a good person
[1:41:16] he just says he can't be a pastor why
[1:41:19] his nature is off even if his skills are
[1:41:21] there he can't do it he won't stay in
[1:41:24] the harness he's going to get tired of
[1:41:26] trudging up here Wednesday night Sunday
[1:41:28] morning Wednesday night Sunday morning
[1:41:30] Wednesday night Sunday morning and never
[1:41:31] going anywhere else and pretty soon he's
[1:41:34] going to flee the harness to go out and
[1:41:35] evangelize why cuz he's an
[1:41:38] evangelist he won't stay home with the
[1:41:40] Sheep that's why he can't be a pastor
[1:41:44] but we don't tear that man down because
[1:41:46] he's not a pastor we build him up
[1:41:49] because he's an
[1:41:50] evangelist we encourage him to do what
[1:41:53] his strength and his nature is inclined
[1:41:55] towards rather than trying to force him
[1:41:57] to stay with us and be a pastor because
[1:41:59] we need a pastor
[1:42:01] amen but he's got to be self-aware
[1:42:04] enough to say I must not be a pastor
[1:42:07] because I'm not being a pastor it's not
[1:42:10] in me to do it my my actions my life are
[1:42:12] not reflecting that of a pastor if I
[1:42:15] can't do what a pastor does then I
[1:42:17] shouldn't be a pastor and he's got to be
[1:42:19] able to see that of himself amen doesn't
[1:42:21] mean he's not a good preacher doesn't
[1:42:23] mean he doesn't have the Holy Ghost it
[1:42:24] just means he's not built to be a pastor
[1:42:27] he's built to be something else listen
[1:42:29] church you can be all flighty as you
[1:42:30] want to be and be an
[1:42:31] evangelist because no consistency is
[1:42:34] required except to go with a message you
[1:42:37] can go anywhere anytime flight is
[1:42:41] okay teacher you can't be flighty and be
[1:42:43] a teacher you got to be solid you got to
[1:42:45] be grounded you got to know where you
[1:42:48] stand Pastor you got to be okay with
[1:42:51] drudgery the same thing day and and day
[1:42:53] out you got to be willing to do that and
[1:42:56] yet not get stuck in a rut it's a tough
[1:42:59] thing it's a very tough
[1:43:01] thing amen listen we have musicians in
[1:43:04] this church but there's only three that
[1:43:06] play on the
[1:43:07] platform now sometimes we have specials
[1:43:09] and people will go up and play for those
[1:43:11] specials amen why don't we have more
[1:43:13] than three up
[1:43:14] here because it's not just about
[1:43:17] skill it's about
[1:43:19] maturity it's about anointing and it's
[1:43:22] about Unity
[1:43:25] I I was reading this
[1:43:26] morning because worship comes by unity
[1:43:29] not Perfection okay the only way that
[1:43:32] worship can be led from this Pulpit is
[1:43:35] if brother Bob is in charge and everyone
[1:43:38] else is following he is the song leader
[1:43:42] he is the worship leader he's been
[1:43:44] authorized by the pastor to lead us into
[1:43:46] worship and guess what sister Mor I hope
[1:43:49] this is okay Church sister Moren brother
[1:43:51] Paul and brother Joe have learned to
[1:43:54] follow brother Bob whether you're right
[1:43:58] or whether you're wrong in their
[1:44:01] opinion that's how they have gotten
[1:44:03] where they are as they have become a
[1:44:05] unit so that we can have a song service
[1:44:08] like we did this morning because they
[1:44:10] are in unity rather than trying to all
[1:44:14] Drive the worship
[1:44:16] bus
[1:44:17] amen and so they have learned and they
[1:44:20] have been shaped to take the strain of
[1:44:23] imperfection right brother Paul right
[1:44:25] brother Joe we don't have to worry about
[1:44:28] sister Mor because she comes up and
[1:44:29] confesses them every
[1:44:34] time I'm sorry brother John I messed up
[1:44:37] I'm like whoa you made you made a
[1:44:39] mistake of the of the 1293 songs that we
[1:44:42] know you made a mistake oh goodness me
[1:44:44] what will we do we need a new piano
[1:44:46] player no praise the Lord praise the
[1:44:49] Lord but she has had to come to a place
[1:44:52] where she is Sur surrendered to the
[1:44:54] leading behind this
[1:44:55] Pulpit brother Paul the same thing
[1:44:57] brother Joe the same thing the unity is
[1:45:01] what brings the worship not the
[1:45:02] Perfection we can we can take the the
[1:45:05] the greatest piano player that's in
[1:45:06] Newland and put him or her up there and
[1:45:09] they will destroy the song service
[1:45:11] because they will try to lead they will
[1:45:13] make it about them amen worship comes
[1:45:17] through humbling Yourself by unity
[1:45:20] brother Braham said this I don't have
[1:45:21] the quote I just wrote it down my notes
[1:45:23] there when Brethren can dwell together
[1:45:25] in unity it's likened unto that oil he
[1:45:28] says we then enter into the presence of
[1:45:31] the Lord with that anointing of Brethren
[1:45:34] together in unity and he says oil
[1:45:36] represents the Holy Spirit that's how
[1:45:39] worship works that's how worship works
[1:45:42] because if what's up here is in
[1:45:44] Conflict this will never work down here
[1:45:47] but because this is in unity now if
[1:45:49] we're in unity together guess what we do
[1:45:52] we have invite the presence of we can
[1:45:54] enter the presence of the Lord because
[1:45:56] we're in unity under what the same oil
[1:45:59] the same anointing we're humbled to him
[1:46:03] We're humbled to him we're not humbled
[1:46:04] to brother Bob we're humbled to the Holy
[1:46:06] Spirit that's leading through brother
[1:46:07] Bob that's the way that it works
[1:46:10] Ministry is service not being
[1:46:14] obeyed and the world has flipped the
[1:46:17] script the religious World on what it
[1:46:19] means to be a minister i i i me me me do
[1:46:23] this for me do that for me no the M the
[1:46:25] the pastor of a church ought to be the
[1:46:27] one that is serving the most that's his
[1:46:30] job is to serve the word Minister means
[1:46:32] a servant a waiter of
[1:46:35] tables church if we were to be honest no
[1:46:38] offense sister Justine serving people at
[1:46:41] a table is probably one of the humblest
[1:46:42] jobs you can
[1:46:45] do because you're there for them not for
[1:46:47] yourself and you get not a whole lot of
[1:46:49] recognition out of make out of doing a
[1:46:51] good job but you always get recognition
[1:46:53] if something gets messed up it's one of
[1:46:56] the hardest jobs in the world to serve
[1:46:58] without
[1:47:00] recognition that's what we're all called
[1:47:02] to is Ministry servitude so that we can
[1:47:06] sand the strain of the imperfect
[1:47:09] note of the unfair
[1:47:12] situation of the lack of recognition of
[1:47:15] the unthankfulness or the taking for
[1:47:17] granted that comes the way of a servant
[1:47:19] listen in the old days when you were a
[1:47:21] servant nobody ever said Thank you you
[1:47:24] were their
[1:47:25] property they didn't thank you they
[1:47:28] didn't thank you it was expected that
[1:47:30] you did a good job and you got punished
[1:47:32] if you didn't that's the way it is for
[1:47:34] us we are serving without expectation
[1:47:38] but at the other side Church let's not
[1:47:39] be ungrateful let's not be ungrateful
[1:47:41] for what we have and the things that
[1:47:43] people
[1:47:44] do Paul says and if they were all one
[1:47:47] member where were the body for all the
[1:47:49] same part are we even a body
[1:47:51] nope need a lot of different parts he
[1:47:54] says but now are they many members yet
[1:47:56] but one body and the eye cannot say to
[1:47:58] the hand I have no need of thee nor
[1:48:01] again the head to the feet I have no
[1:48:03] need of you remember before it was one
[1:48:05] saying well I'm not them therefore I'm
[1:48:06] not a part of the body so on the other
[1:48:08] side is is I can't come to you and say
[1:48:09] because you're not like me you're not a
[1:48:11] part of the
[1:48:12] body
[1:48:14] amen do we want a part to be
[1:48:18] missing I don't want to lose any body
[1:48:20] parts Church
[1:48:24] he says nay much more those members of
[1:48:27] the body which seem to be more feeble
[1:48:29] are necessary if you go into the the the
[1:48:32] uh the Amplified it says the parts that
[1:48:35] seem weak are of the utmost
[1:48:38] necessity the small things are the
[1:48:40] indispensable ones you can go down to a
[1:48:42] cellular level and we can see that but
[1:48:44] the tiniest things in our body can make
[1:48:45] the biggest difference you ever have a
[1:48:48] an ache or a pain and you go to a doctor
[1:48:51] and they say oh it's just this little
[1:48:52] thing
[1:48:53] and you think my whole body was aching I
[1:48:55] couldn't get any sleep when it was just
[1:48:57] this little thing yeah cuz it was out of
[1:48:58] joint it was had a nerve tweaked it had
[1:49:00] a whatever the tiniest little things can
[1:49:02] set us off just because it's not exactly
[1:49:05] right he says and those members of the
[1:49:07] body which we think to be less honorable
[1:49:09] upon those we bestore more abundant
[1:49:11] honor and our uncomely parts have more
[1:49:13] abundant comeliness so the things that
[1:49:15] aren't so great we try and dress them up
[1:49:17] to make them not so obvious that they're
[1:49:20] bad I have a big nose so I don't wear
[1:49:22] this or I don't wear that I've got
[1:49:25] narrow shoulders big
[1:49:26] hips what do we do we try and hide our
[1:49:29] imper imperfections to make them more
[1:49:31] beautiful he says for comely Parts have
[1:49:34] no need this is not a looks
[1:49:37] contest looking good doesn't make you a
[1:49:39] child of
[1:49:40] God a beautiful face doesn't make your
[1:49:43] body stronger a perfect nose doesn't
[1:49:45] make you breathe
[1:49:46] better he says but God had tempered the
[1:49:49] body together God has built the temper
[1:49:51] built the body together
[1:49:53] having given more abundant honor to that
[1:49:55] part which lacked so God's way of
[1:50:00] boosting us is to give honor to that
[1:50:02] which seems to not be worthy of it
[1:50:05] that's God's way of showing us what you
[1:50:07] think is important isn't
[1:50:09] important what I think not me what God
[1:50:12] thinks is important that's the one he
[1:50:14] honors and that's the things that we
[1:50:16] ought to amen like I said you go to a
[1:50:17] doctor and you got a major issue and
[1:50:19] he'll say it's down to one thing you
[1:50:21] need more iron you need uh you need your
[1:50:24] your your hip joint adjusted
[1:50:29] slightly sometimes we're focused on the
[1:50:31] wrong things and they're just symptoms
[1:50:33] of the real problem and sometimes it can
[1:50:35] be just a little thing that's out of out
[1:50:36] of
[1:50:38] place he says that there should be no
[1:50:41] Schism in the body but that the members
[1:50:44] should have the same care one for
[1:50:46] another that word Schism means division
[1:50:48] a tearing in a garment Discord and
[1:50:51] separation
[1:50:53] he's saying he's gone through all this
[1:50:55] effort to show us that just because it
[1:50:57] doesn't look important doesn't mean it's
[1:50:59] not important that the goodlooking stuff
[1:51:01] is not as important as The Not So
[1:51:02] good-look stuff that the hidden things
[1:51:04] are just as important as the things that
[1:51:05] are seen why is he telling us this he's
[1:51:08] saying so that we don't have schisms in
[1:51:10] the body so the schisms can be removed
[1:51:13] or eliminated by me realizing that I
[1:51:15] need you and that you need
[1:51:17] me every single one of us in this
[1:51:19] building this morning that there's not a
[1:51:21] person here without a person purp or
[1:51:23] without a need amen sometimes we've got
[1:51:24] to have a little pain to realize how
[1:51:26] valuable it is to keep something
[1:51:28] involved to keep something in the body
[1:51:30] to keep something healthy to give it
[1:51:32] that Focus amen we have to Value what we
[1:51:34] bring not what we don't bring in other
[1:51:37] words you know there ought to be a a
[1:51:40] Schism in the body because we're not
[1:51:42] here rather than because we are
[1:51:45] here do you catch what I mean us being
[1:51:49] here should cause things to be tighter
[1:51:53] and us not being here should cause
[1:51:55] things to fall
[1:51:56] apart my presence ought not to cause
[1:51:58] this church to split up that's what I'm
[1:52:01] saying in other words my my my my my
[1:52:05] attendance in this church my involvement
[1:52:06] in this church should cause it to be
[1:52:08] together not to be driven
[1:52:11] apart my nature my attitude my
[1:52:13] insistence my gift my calling should not
[1:52:16] be causing wedges it should be causing
[1:52:19] Unity amen
[1:52:23] he says now and whether one member
[1:52:24] suffer all the members suffer with it or
[1:52:27] one member be honored all the members
[1:52:30] Rejoice with it now that can be a hard
[1:52:32] thing because not everyone gets
[1:52:34] appreciated the same way do
[1:52:36] we some of us have very public very
[1:52:39] obvious things that we do and people
[1:52:41] appreciate it and they can see it and
[1:52:43] they can do it but some roles are silent
[1:52:45] they're quiet remember brother B talked
[1:52:48] about that man that was holding meetings
[1:52:49] and there was one lady that prayed for
[1:52:51] that service
[1:52:53] and he says the success of the meeting
[1:52:54] came down to that woman praying and if
[1:52:56] he never said it nobody would have
[1:53:00] known she may not have even
[1:53:03] known but we don't know that I don't
[1:53:05] know what you're doing at home in your
[1:53:06] prayer
[1:53:07] closet I don't know but you do it as
[1:53:10] unto God not unto me and that's the
[1:53:13] nature of a servant is we're doing it to
[1:53:15] serve not for the feedback but we're all
[1:53:18] human aren't we everybody loves a pat on
[1:53:20] the back and add a boy and add a girl
[1:53:22] and so we ought to be able to do those
[1:53:24] things but the thing is when somebody
[1:53:25] else is getting the atab boy or the at a
[1:53:27] girl can we be happy for them or do we
[1:53:31] begrudge it because we didn't get our at
[1:53:32] a boy or our at a girl this year or this
[1:53:35] day or this week or whatever it might
[1:53:38] be likewise when somebody's
[1:53:41] hurting do we all
[1:53:44] hurt or do we say well that's just
[1:53:47] they'll get over it we've all got to go
[1:53:49] through our trials we've all got our
[1:53:51] load to bear no we're supposed to Bear
[1:53:53] one another's burdens supposed to hold
[1:53:55] each other up in prayer amen he says now
[1:53:58] ye are the body of Christ and members in
[1:54:00] particular that means members with a
[1:54:03] portion you all have a little bit you
[1:54:06] you take something as small as your
[1:54:07] pinky foot or pinky toe how many people
[1:54:10] in here think the pinky is very
[1:54:11] important pinky toe it's the smallest
[1:54:13] digit it's the smallest digit in your
[1:54:15] body fingers and toes it's the smallest
[1:54:18] of all of those it is so small and yet
[1:54:20] if you lose that pinky toe you lose your
[1:54:23] ability to properly balance your
[1:54:25] body because it's on the outside it
[1:54:27] provides a balancing Force when you're
[1:54:28] moving it gives you agility it allows
[1:54:31] you to put your power down to the ground
[1:54:33] properly gives you grip it's one of the
[1:54:36] most important things on your feet and
[1:54:39] yet it's the little thing my pinky to is
[1:54:41] about this big chop it off and all of a
[1:54:43] sudden I don't have half the agility or
[1:54:45] balance that I'm supposed to it's the
[1:54:47] smallest things that can balance the
[1:54:49] body out amen the small all
[1:54:52] insignificant
[1:54:54] parts are crucial to this body to keep
[1:54:58] it in perfect health and you'll find
[1:55:01] that it's the smaller things in your
[1:55:02] body that give you the fine motor
[1:55:04] controls to do the really delicate
[1:55:06] things listen if I chop my pinky toes
[1:55:09] off I can still walk and run but I can't
[1:55:13] I can't move and Juke the way that a a
[1:55:14] football running back does because I've
[1:55:16] lost my ability for balance and change
[1:55:18] of Direction putting the power down in
[1:55:20] those things each of us
[1:55:23] listen I'm not saying we don't have bigs
[1:55:24] and Smalls because we have roles with
[1:55:27] greater responsibility and lesser
[1:55:29] absolutely we can't deny that but the
[1:55:31] point is every one of them contributes
[1:55:34] to the health of the body and you lose
[1:55:36] one you lose the health it might be
[1:55:39] survivable but you still lose the health
[1:55:42] you lose the ability to do what you're
[1:55:44] supposed to we read the scripture last
[1:55:46] service and I'm
[1:55:47] closing I want to end with this thought
[1:55:50] Paul said but every man had his proper
[1:55:52] gift of God one after this manner and
[1:55:55] one after and another after that every
[1:55:57] single person has a particular proper
[1:56:01] specific ordained gift of God to serve
[1:56:04] the
[1:56:04] body Braham says this he says when God
[1:56:07] has called a person for a job to do
[1:56:09] there is no one can take its place there
[1:56:12] is no one can take your place your
[1:56:15] peculiarity see sometimes it's the
[1:56:18] things that are different that make us
[1:56:21] fit for service
[1:56:23] you know what we're all a little bit
[1:56:27] weird I'm sorry and if you don't know
[1:56:30] how you're weird come to me after church
[1:56:32] and I'll tell you how you're
[1:56:34] weird cuz we all have it church we all
[1:56:37] have it the the best of the best okay
[1:56:41] sweet sweet Becky is
[1:56:45] weird
[1:56:47] Okay that's it every one of us I don't
[1:56:49] care how good you are how great you are
[1:56:51] how much people like you you still have
[1:56:54] your little foibles and little bumps and
[1:56:58] lumps I'm not saying you we let me say
[1:57:00] we okay we'll be inclusive this morning
[1:57:03] I've got my foibles and my bumps and my
[1:57:05] lumps and I'm just plain weird that's
[1:57:08] why God gave me a wife that's not the
[1:57:09] same way I am so she can balance out my
[1:57:12] lumps and bumps and foibles and
[1:57:14] weirdness and sometimes occasionally let
[1:57:16] me know in a very loving way you're
[1:57:19] weird don't do that that's not helping
[1:57:21] the situation
[1:57:23] come on now you're smiling you on the
[1:57:24] you're with me this morning I trust
[1:57:30] amen he says no one can take your place
[1:57:34] your peculiarity okay brother Mt I'm
[1:57:37] going to pick on your family this
[1:57:38] morning we have three young ladies cut
[1:57:42] from the coffee
[1:57:43] Quarry and guess what they aren't even
[1:57:46] remotely the
[1:57:49] same Matt couldn't raise them all the
[1:57:51] same Matt can't treat them all the same
[1:57:54] they have different gifts they have
[1:57:56] different strengths and guess what
[1:57:58] they've got different weirdnesses too
[1:58:01] cut from the same Quarry cut from the
[1:58:03] same Stone fit for purpose
[1:58:09] peculiar and every family's like it you
[1:58:11] look at all of our families none of our
[1:58:13] kids are the same as the one next to
[1:58:15] them why God has a purpose for them and
[1:58:19] he shaped them to fit his purpose
[1:58:23] Amen in your original nature you're
[1:58:27] broken you might have all the right
[1:58:29] stuff but it takes him to come down and
[1:58:32] he's saying God picked you God doesn't
[1:58:36] make mistakes you say I'm weird
[1:58:39] sometimes we know we're weird God
[1:58:42] doesn't make mistakes amen if you get
[1:58:46] anything this morning catch that if he
[1:58:48] has picked you if he has chosen you if
[1:58:50] he has given you his spirit God never
[1:58:53] makes
[1:58:55] mistakes you're elected in your
[1:58:57] peculiarity remember what we read
[1:58:59] earlier he said he gave me the Holy
[1:59:01] Ghost with my
[1:59:05] peculiarities they're not going to stop
[1:59:07] him now he may have to do some shaving
[1:59:09] and some some shoving and some cutting
[1:59:11] and some shaving and all these different
[1:59:12] things
[1:59:13] absolutely but he's made you that way
[1:59:15] for
[1:59:16] purpose catch what he says this you know
[1:59:19] we we've got
[1:59:23] we've got to remember we don't get
[1:59:24] fitted into the body as we are we get
[1:59:27] fitted into the body the way that he
[1:59:29] makes us and we've got to come from a
[1:59:31] man image to a word image amen we've got
[1:59:34] this this Twisted thing going around
[1:59:35] today and you'll hear it all the time if
[1:59:37] you you listen to you know these people
[1:59:39] especially in alternative Lifestyles and
[1:59:41] they say well God Made Me The Way I Am
[1:59:43] therefore he has to love me the way I am
[1:59:45] well fallacy number one is God didn't
[1:59:47] make you that way sin made you that way
[1:59:50] God's got a different thing he wants to
[1:59:51] make you in you're in the image of man
[1:59:53] he wants to make you in the image of God
[1:59:55] by the word okay so we got to be able to
[1:59:58] not not say that my
[2:00:00] weirdness I just hold on to it if I can
[2:00:03] put it that way my strangeness my
[2:00:05] foibles my bumps he may have to shave
[2:00:07] some of that off he may have to cut and
[2:00:08] chisel some of that off but he has still
[2:00:10] made you as you are and he'll take it
[2:00:13] and he'll refine it that's what the holy
[2:00:14] spirit's doing he's refining what's
[2:00:16] there for his purpose to produce his
[2:00:18] shape His
[2:00:19] Image but says this we're closing he
[2:00:22] says he caught me when I am no when I
[2:00:24] was nothing he says I'm still nothing
[2:00:27] but I'm in his hand that makes all the
[2:00:30] difference church I'm in his hand see he
[2:00:32] caught me and he loved me when I was
[2:00:34] unlovable he loved you when you were
[2:00:36] unlovable but he changed you but he
[2:00:40] changed you just like the colored sister
[2:00:42] said that time in her testimony she said
[2:00:44] I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not
[2:00:46] what I want to be but then I'm not what
[2:00:48] I used to be she knew she had come
[2:00:50] somewhere and something had
[2:00:53] happened he says and that's the way it
[2:00:56] is if God when I was an alien from him
[2:01:00] so love me till he stoop down to get me
[2:01:03] and pick me up that gives me confidence
[2:01:06] that he wants to use me Hallelujah
[2:01:08] church if he came down and filled me
[2:01:10] with his Spirit he does it with purpose
[2:01:13] because the spirit only comes to Sons
[2:01:15] and Daughters of God which means you are
[2:01:17] in his mind before the world began he's
[2:01:19] got a word for you he's got an elected
[2:01:21] purpose he's got an elected position and
[2:01:23] he's come down and he's given you his
[2:01:25] Spirit to shape you into his
[2:01:28] word God doesn't make
[2:01:32] mistakes he says he's got a purpose in
[2:01:35] doing it he saw something in me he saw
[2:01:38] something in you he had a reason to save
[2:01:40] you look at the people that's unsaved
[2:01:42] today look at the millions he could have
[2:01:45] taken beside you but he took you he says
[2:01:48] amen no one can take your place amen
[2:01:50] you're in God's economy no one can do it
[2:01:53] that's his love to
[2:01:57] you I'm not a fan of psychology as a way
[2:02:00] of
[2:02:01] life there's a man named Jordan Peterson
[2:02:04] that says what is killing our young men
[2:02:05] in particular is that we are taking
[2:02:08] purpose out of their lives they have no
[2:02:11] reason to live and therefore they go
[2:02:13] home and they play
[2:02:15] games they don't get married they don't
[2:02:17] have a family they just show up to work
[2:02:19] and they go home and they waste their
[2:02:20] lives why they have found a purpose he
[2:02:23] says God's love to you is he gives you a
[2:02:26] purpose and a place and he gives you the
[2:02:30] power to go in
[2:02:31] there he fits you by his word amen when
[2:02:35] it came to the temple there was a great
[2:02:36] master plan and only Solomon had the
[2:02:39] plan initially only Solomon had the plan
[2:02:42] only Solomon knew how it went together
[2:02:44] and so when he go when he was ready to
[2:02:46] start what did he do he shared his plan
[2:02:48] with his foremen and they went out and
[2:02:51] he shared it with his planners and his
[2:02:52] suppliers and his purchasers and they
[2:02:54] went out and they started Gathering
[2:02:56] those items together now if you were at
[2:02:58] the lower end of the supply chain and
[2:03:00] you saw that he wanted these little
[2:03:01] doohickeys you'd say what in the world
[2:03:04] is that for and why does he need
[2:03:08] it why do we need Collins in this
[2:03:11] church why do we need Shaws why do we
[2:03:13] need Benjamins why do we need the
[2:03:15] carlettes they were gone for 16 years
[2:03:17] why can't we just have coffees I'm not
[2:03:18] picking on the coffees but it was the
[2:03:19] coffees that started the church you can
[2:03:22] say why do we need it we need it because
[2:03:24] there was a bill of materials at
[2:03:26] cport and you may not see how it fits
[2:03:28] you may not see how it works but they
[2:03:30] are here we are here all of us because
[2:03:33] there's a bill of materials called the
[2:03:35] word of God that says these people must
[2:03:37] be here listen he had to bring brother
[2:03:39] Garfield all the way from
[2:03:40] Jamaica he's our greatest import by
[2:03:48] distance listen he had to send me around
[2:03:50] for 16 years to get me cut into shape to
[2:03:52] come
[2:03:54] back why that's what he needed that's
[2:03:58] what we
[2:04:00] needed
[2:04:02] amen the plan calls for us and so we're
[2:04:05] here now listen we may not all be ready
[2:04:09] we may not be in the proper shape to
[2:04:11] just be fitted in just yet listen he's
[2:04:13] still working on me I don't know about
[2:04:15] you but when the pressure comes when the
[2:04:17] load comes I'll be ready I'm trusting
[2:04:20] that amen there were all sorts of little
[2:04:23] details and I I I've been reading it in
[2:04:25] devotions and so I'm very familiar with
[2:04:27] with the details that went into this
[2:04:29] Temple and all sorts of little
[2:04:30] intricacies and little features the
[2:04:32] temple on on the walls they offset every
[2:04:35] stone by 3 mm backwards so that when you
[2:04:39] look up to it it doesn't look like it's
[2:04:40] going to fall on
[2:04:42] you you'd say why are we doing
[2:04:45] that to make people feel
[2:04:48] safer that's it has no structural
[2:04:51] benefit
[2:04:52] makes people feel safer that's it it's
[2:04:56] in the
[2:04:58] plan but you look at that Temple and it
[2:05:00] was the most beautiful building ever
[2:05:02] built they said the entire holy of
[2:05:04] holies was completely covered in Gold
[2:05:09] 100% representing deity and then he had
[2:05:11] more gold left over so he rolled it out
[2:05:13] into the holy
[2:05:15] place that's how much that's how
[2:05:17] beautiful it was can you imagine a place
[2:05:18] you go to The Basilica and you can see
[2:05:20] the gold details up in the ceiling it's
[2:05:22] it is beautiful imagine an entire room
[2:05:26] encased in Gold what that would look
[2:05:29] like amen but if someone tried to ignore
[2:05:33] the plan tried to ignore the drawings
[2:05:35] tried to ignore the instructions and
[2:05:36] then tried to put the temple together it
[2:05:38] would never fit it would never have
[2:05:40] worked exactly and they would have had
[2:05:41] to what do stop Gap measures they would
[2:05:44] have had to adjust on the Fly they would
[2:05:47] have had to use zip
[2:05:48] ties if you ever worked on a car in New
[2:05:50] Finland your favorite friend is is your
[2:05:51] zip tie because when something fails you
[2:05:53] just zip tie it together zip ties won't
[2:05:56] hold the Temple of the Living God
[2:05:58] they've got to be fitted perfectly amen
[2:06:01] and they had odd pieces they had
[2:06:02] odd-shaped pieces there can you imagine
[2:06:04] a foreman saying why do we need this
[2:06:07] odd-shaped piece why do we need this
[2:06:10] peculiar brother or
[2:06:12] sister can you imagine him arguing with
[2:06:14] Solomon who has the master plan this
[2:06:17] shouldn't be in this
[2:06:18] church Solomon would say where does it
[2:06:22] go I don't know it's just too weird to
[2:06:24] go but there's a place for it there's a
[2:06:27] position I've got for that little weird
[2:06:30] peace sometimes we wonder about
[2:06:33] people sometimes we wonder about
[2:06:36] ourselves why are we here what are we
[2:06:39] doing what's my
[2:06:41] part god has a place for your little
[2:06:44] peculiarity in the body of Christ God
[2:06:47] doesn't make mistakes two quotes as we
[2:06:49] close he says whether you see eye to eye
[2:06:51] like that doesn't matter we're at least
[2:06:54] Christians Brethren born in the same
[2:06:55] family God received us in our
[2:06:58] peculiarities we should receive each
[2:07:01] other he says and if God accepted you
[2:07:03] with your peculiarities and I with my
[2:07:06] peculiarities we should be thankful
[2:07:08] enough to recognize each other as
[2:07:11] brothers and sisters see and we're all
[2:07:13] working for one great purpose that's for
[2:07:16] his kingdom and anything different from
[2:07:19] that would be the wrong motive anyhow
[2:07:22] amen God bless you let's stand together
[2:07:24] if we
[2:07:27] would very pastoral this
[2:07:30] morning I'm trusting that's
[2:07:33] okay because in the end we are
[2:07:36] human we all have our little things that
[2:07:38] we do and don't do things we like things
[2:07:40] we don't like people we like people we
[2:07:42] don't like things we prefer things we
[2:07:44] wish weren't
[2:07:45] around we've got our own ideas we've got
[2:07:47] our own opinions but there's a master
[2:07:50] plan and that means there's a master
[2:07:52] planner a master designer that has
[2:07:54] looked down on this congregation and he
[2:07:56] has said they're here for
[2:07:59] purpose and you may not realize it yet
[2:08:02] but you're here for purpose and if you
[2:08:04] haven't realized it it doesn't mean
[2:08:06] you're not doing your purpose but
[2:08:08] sometimes it just takes God to open our
[2:08:09] eyes to say this is what you're supposed
[2:08:10] to do he would talk about sisters and he
[2:08:13] would say you have a gift of motherhood
[2:08:16] you know what this world's needs real
[2:08:18] mothers that's one of the greatest lacks
[2:08:20] we have because they're all in the
[2:08:21] workforce
[2:08:22] and Grandma's raising their kids or some
[2:08:24] daycare is raising their kids you've got
[2:08:25] a gift of motherhood to show this world
[2:08:27] to be a living tablet a living Stone of
[2:08:30] what it means to be a
[2:08:31] mother that may be your
[2:08:35] position but remember brother Bram says
[2:08:37] he says you're the Fifth Gospel in that
[2:08:40] position because you have more time with
[2:08:43] those kids to teach them about the
[2:08:45] things of God and raise them in the
[2:08:46] admonition and fear of God daddies don't
[2:08:49] have that time only mothers get that
[2:08:51] time he says you might be a mechanic you
[2:08:53] might be a farmer you might be this or
[2:08:55] that hey we're blessed to have brother
[2:08:57] Matt you know he's over there helping a
[2:08:59] friend of mine put in a mini split who
[2:09:01] of us can do that we can't he's here for
[2:09:05] purpose amen some of us are here for one
[2:09:09] thing that can be very spiritual and you
[2:09:12] know what we feel that that makes us
[2:09:13] better because we're and then somebody
[2:09:16] over there is doing the practical but
[2:09:17] guess what if all we do is spiritual and
[2:09:19] nothing practical the temple never got
[2:09:22] built right I will pray that you find
[2:09:25] the right Stones brother yeah but we
[2:09:26] need somebody to cut the
[2:09:28] stones we need somebody to to give the
[2:09:30] money well I would pray no no no we've
[2:09:33] got the spiritual side and we've got the
[2:09:34] Practical side and both of them are
[2:09:36] required in the body of Christ and you
[2:09:37] see that in the gifts the gifts are
[2:09:40] there to balance the Practical with the
[2:09:43] spiritual and it's not up to us to
[2:09:45] spiritualize anything or to put down
[2:09:48] those that are on the Practical side
[2:09:50] we've all got a purpose
[2:09:52] remember brother Gerald saying you
[2:09:53] you're so spiritual you're of no earthly
[2:09:55] good we've got to be real careful that
[2:09:58] we're so high up in our spirituality but
[2:09:59] we can't put a helping hand to our
[2:10:01] brother or sister put our shoulder to
[2:10:03] the wheel amen I'm not trying to be hard
[2:10:05] I'm trying to say this morning we've all
[2:10:08] got a part to play and it's all not
[2:10:10] going to seem like it's
[2:10:14] heavenbound it may not save a soul but
[2:10:17] it may give somebody else an opportunity
[2:10:19] to talk to that soul
[2:10:21] sometimes our friendship sometimes our
[2:10:22] help it opens the door for somebody to
[2:10:25] have an opportunity to work with that
[2:10:26] person that has a gift and that's it
[2:10:29] your your your part was to bring them in
[2:10:31] it's somebody else's part to bring them
[2:10:33] all the way to lead them into the
[2:10:35] water we've all got that part to play
[2:10:38] none of us any less critical than the
[2:10:40] other if you believe that we can do
[2:10:43] without somebody then I invite you to go
[2:10:45] home and choose which part of your body
[2:10:46] you don't want to have none of us would
[2:10:48] do it because we know it's all there
[2:10:51] even if we don't understand they say you
[2:10:53] can take your appendix out no big deal
[2:10:56] why cuz they never understood what it
[2:10:57] was for and they're still not sure what
[2:10:58] it's for they've got ideas but I'll tell
[2:11:01] you what you're better off with it than
[2:11:02] without it because God put it there for
[2:11:04] a reason if we even if we don't yet
[2:11:06] understand it amen God doesn't make
[2:11:10] mistakes you're not here by a chance
[2:11:12] you're not here even by your own choice
[2:11:14] you're here because the bill of
[2:11:15] materials in heaven called for you to be
[2:11:17] a part of the Temple of the Living God
[2:11:20] Amen God bless you let's bow our
[2:11:22] heads Lord
[2:11:26] Jesus Lord I pray you help us to find
[2:11:29] our
[2:11:30] place Lord that we would yield oursel to
[2:11:33] the Master's
[2:11:35] Hand Lord that we would yield our
[2:11:38] peculiarities our ideas our thoughts our
[2:11:41] motives our objectives our
[2:11:43] desires Lord and that above all would
[2:11:45] come out a willing heart that's willing
[2:11:46] to be led to obey to meet a
[2:11:50] need Lord I don't want to be the driver
[2:11:53] I don't want to be the
[2:11:54] leader Lord I want to walk with you as
[2:11:57] you lead Lord I believe that's the
[2:11:59] desire of every heart that's here and
[2:12:02] Lord you know what we all think of
[2:12:03] ourselves you know what we think of each
[2:12:06] other Lord I pray you help us to see
[2:12:08] ourselves in your plan to compare
[2:12:11] ourselves to what you would have for us
[2:12:13] not to the person next to us Lord God
[2:12:16] Lord help us to not look down on the
[2:12:18] other nor to lift each other up
[2:12:20] unnecessary Lord but help us to be
[2:12:22] humble before you Lord servants working
[2:12:25] together for the kingdom of God lord and
[2:12:27] as we see our part may you make us
[2:12:30] content in it Lord help us to be

[2:12:42] unifying oil it makes every difference

[2:12:54] all men that you're my disciples by your
[2:12:56] love one for another Lord I pray your
[2:12:58] love would unify us this morning Lord I
[2:13:01] pray you bless us even now as we go into
[2:13:03] the communion Lord may you strengthen us
[2:13:05] encourage us Lord may you bring
[2:13:08] healing or may you draw us closer
[2:13:10] together in bonds of love we pray in
[2:13:12] Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[2:13:15] amen amen The Potter's hand
[2:13:19] 1273 can we sing sing it like we mean it
[2:13:24] listen if you ever watch have you ever
[2:13:25] watched a Potter mold the
[2:13:29] clay you know how they start they take a
[2:13:32] lump and they just
[2:13:33] go it's all we are is a
[2:13:36] lump and then they start to poke it and
[2:13:39] probe it and shape it and shave it and
[2:13:41] do all these different things and it
[2:13:43] goes from a lump into of times this
[2:13:45] beautiful vase or this beautiful ear or
[2:13:48] cup or whatever they're making with all
[2:13:50] sorts of little fancy curves and details
[2:13:52] but it starts as a lump but if that that
[2:13:55] clay could resist it would say don't
[2:13:57] touch me leave me I want to just stay
[2:13:59] the way I am but he's turning us into
[2:14:02] something that's made that's beautiful
[2:14:04] that's useful what's a lump of clay good
[2:14:06] for throwing throwing at people that's
[2:14:09] all a glump of clay is good for but he
[2:14:10] turns us into something that somebody
[2:14:12] can use day in and day out he makes us
[2:14:14] fit for
[2:14:15] purpose but we've got to surrender to it
[2:14:18] cuz we have a will we have a will this
[2:14:20] body has a will and we've got to
[2:14:22] surrender that so that we can come into
[2:14:24] his perfect plan as it talks about let

[2:21:07] made it and it's all about
[2:21:12] you it's all about to
[2:21:16] Jesus I'm coming back to the heart Heart
[2:21:21] of

[2:21:26] you it's all about you
[2:21:31] Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the things i'
[2:21:36] made it and it's all about
[2:21:41] you it's all about you
[2:21:47] Jesus amen we're going to change the
[2:21:49] order of the service
[2:21:51] now if you can turn in your
[2:21:53] scriptures 1 Corinthians chap
[2:22:10] 11 1 Corinthians chap 11 we'll start at
[2:22:13] verse 23 I'll read the first verse in
[2:22:16] the church the second or the next and
[2:22:19] we'll alternate then we'll all join
[2:22:21] together on the 34th
[2:22:24] verse and Paul says for I have received
[2:22:27] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[2:22:30] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[2:22:33] night in which he was betrayed took
[2:22:45] bread and after the same manner also he
[2:22:48] took the cup and when he had s saying
[2:22:50] this cup is the New Testament in my
[2:22:52] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[2:22:55] it in remembrance of
[2:23:04] me wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[2:23:07] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:23:10] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:23:13] and blood of the Lord the prophet of God
[2:23:15] would say there he says communion is a
[2:23:18] showdown then because you drink
[2:23:19] unworthily you've been living
[2:23:22] unworthily habitually is what that means
[2:23:25] listen we all make mistakes but if
[2:23:27] habitually we're off we're not supposed
[2:23:29] to take it unless we've made it right
[2:23:32] truly made it right not just made it
[2:23:34] right so we can come up and take the
[2:23:36] communion but made it right in our
[2:23:38] hearts and said Lord I don't want to be
[2:23:40] doing that Lord take that out of my life
[2:23:42] take that away otherwise he says you're
[2:23:44] drinking it unworthy and there's
[2:23:46] condemnation now instead of freedom and
[2:23:48] healing amen go ahead
[2:23:59] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:24:00] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:24:03] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:24:11] body for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:24:14] should not be judged let me hold it
[2:24:17] there self- discernment is the greatest
[2:24:19] discernment you can have
[2:24:21] because remember what Jesus said he says
[2:24:23] you look at your brother and you say let
[2:24:25] help me get the sliver out of your eye
[2:24:26] and he says and you can't see the beam
[2:24:28] in your own those Pharisees were so
[2:24:31] religious but they had no self-d
[2:24:32] discernment they couldn't judge
[2:24:34] themselves by the word the opportunity
[2:24:36] for us is to judge ourselves by the word
[2:24:38] so that we're not judged later if we can
[2:24:40] say Lord that's where I'm at Lord this
[2:24:43] is where I'm at this is what I have this
[2:24:44] is what's going on he can deal with it
[2:24:47] but our discernment is meant first to
[2:24:49] look inwardly
[2:24:51] because only when we're clean can we
[2:24:52] help somebody else only when we've been
[2:24:54] delivered can we help somebody else be
[2:24:56] delivered you got to freely get it
[2:24:58] before you can give it that's and so our
[2:25:00] discernment when it comes to communion
[2:25:02] is not on what somebody else has done or
[2:25:04] not done it's Lord where am I according
[2:25:06] to your word and we discern it and we
[2:25:09] judge ourselves by the word so that he
[2:25:11] doesn't have to come down in correction
[2:25:13] amen continue if you would
[2:25:21] not wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:25:25] together to eat carry one for another
[2:25:28] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[2:25:31] home that you come not together unto
[2:25:34] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[2:25:37] order when I come we're going to sing
[2:25:40] that song as we come for communion we're
[2:25:42] going to have the sisters to my left the
[2:25:44] brothers to my right we're going to sing
[2:25:47] that
[2:25:48] song Thank You Jesus
[2:25:50] for the grace that you have given as we
[2:25:53] come and prepare to take the bread and
[2:25:55] the wine amen you can turn off the uh
[2:25:59] stream as well brother V
