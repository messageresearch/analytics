we've got a certain end Lord that you're committed to us Lord that you have thoughts towards us and their good thoughts Lord not of evil Lord but to bring us to that expected end and Lord we're trusting in that this evening Lord we're trusting even as brother Ivan Brenton goes through a hard time Lord that your mercies and Grace and comfort will be with him Lord those that have lost a loved one Lord we're praying your Special Touch for them through the coming days and weeks Lord Lord but we're asking you to be in our midst once again this evening Lord God in the not as just in the worship and praise Lord but in the preaching and hearing of the word also Lord God may you discern the thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord may you just set us on a right path may you draw us closer to you Lord help us to just willingly set aside everything that comes against us Lord that would Lord come between you and us Lord draw us closer to you we pray now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 1 and then we'll go to John chapter 8 right after that and John chapter 1 Welcome each one amen welcome sister Rebecca ebear I believe it is amen God bless you good to have you with us amen also wanted to say that uh we got got the the moose meat from the church moose and we put as much of it as we could in the freezer out there so you can go and just take whatever you need to as you need it and and don't worry about it there's there's plenty there and we've got more at our place as well um as needed there so go ahead and take that definitely want to remember brother Ivan Brenton and the loss of his wife I had talked to him earlier today before she passed just to let him know we'd be there to support them in the funeral service and a number of us has committed to going out there to help with song leading and ministering and music and these different things but we'll see how that works out as they as he sorts out the uh the funeral arrangements but just want to remember him as you can imagine husband for 54 years and love of his life is gone no children with her or anything so it's an empty house very empty house and she hasn't been there for quite some time but you know he's been spending 12 hours a day in the hospital with her and just kind of comes to a sudden crashing halt so we want to remember him in prayer he's very broken up about it and he needs our support he needs our help and I've told him we'll do anything we can with that amen amen turning the word now if we would I'm getting a bit of an echo here amen John chap 1 verse4 we read this in the last service and we'll read it again this is speaking of the word Christ the word it says in him was life and the life was the light of men and then if we'll turn to John 8 and verse 12 John 8 and: 12 it says then spake Jesus unto them again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening anden just trusting his goodness and we're going to continue on our series on manifesting time and I'm taking a second service on the subtitle of the spirit of light and we spoke last service and really we were focused on letting the Holy Spirit into every aspect of our life and not having doors closed and not having areas off bounds you know brother Bron would talk about do you do you invite some into your house and then you say well you can't go upstairs and you can't go here and you can't go there he said if he's the Lord of your life see savior's easy savior's easy because that's what he does for you amen and you can walk away and that's a free gift given but when he becomes Lord now he's got access now he's supposed to have you know you're supposed to make everything available to him amen and we're supposed to let the word of God take effect and whether it's in preaching whether it's in the reading or hearing of the word whatever it might be God has ordained the word to be active amen that we're not just sitting here and just nodding our heads and saying amen but amen amen means so be it and when I say Amen it means so be it in my life and when you say Amen that means you're saying Lord so let it be in my life that it's not just agreeing that it's right but it's agreeing that it's right for me and I want my life to match up with what the word says amen and that takes real humility that takes sincerity that takes us saying you know like like brother bam talked about that color woman she says you know I'm not where I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be either and as far as forward as some some of us are and you know you look at the elders and whatnot in the church you say well how much further can you go we can all go further amen we've all got further to go we've all got a an ability to go closer to God Amen and we've got to be able to say Lord I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get me there Lord whatever he asked me to lay down whatever you ask me to pick up I'll do it if it means I can get closer to you but I want to spend a bit of time this evening and we won't be long Lord willing tonight but I want to look at what this looks like practically because we've been talking about walking in the light and you say well brother John what does that mean to walk in the light what does it look like on a day-to-day basis how do I walk in the light how do I get closer to God how do I spend my time in the presence of God and I want to focus on the idea that we're meant to show forth the Praises of God every day of our life we're supposed to be reflecting God where we're supposed to be reflecting his life in us and he's brought us out of darkness and he's brought us into light and that means there ought to be a way we used to be and there ought to be a way we are and there ought to be a difference between the two amen there ought to be a big Gulf a big separation between what I used to be and what I am today even if I was raised in this message I've said it before when I was raised in this message I I believed it to be true in general but boy I had I had problems with people and I had problems with Ministries I had problems with this and that and the other thing and thoughts and opinions and when I truly gave my heart to the Lord and when I got the Holy Ghost those thoughts changed my Doctrine changed my understanding changed my Revelation changed and all of a sudden why because now he's working on me and it's not subject to the filter of my mind but now submitted myself to the Holy Spirit I've made him Lord of my life and he starts to take a hold of these things amen we get a change when we repent absolutely we do we get a change when we're baptized we get a change when we're Sanctified but the change is constantly going on in our life because the word is alive amen and is supposed to be active in our life every day amen when we can go through repentance baptism sanctification and never be a Christian remember Christian means Christlike now if I ask for a show of hands I'm not going to but how many would say today I'm Christlike that's a high standard that's a high standard to say I'm Christlike and here's the thing in this flesh will never be a perfect reflection but let's focus on where we are reflecting and where we're not say Lord make us a reflection of you amen but in this flesh dwells no good thing as we've talked about before but we've got to live it like we believe it amen and our life shows how we really believe it if we really believe it then we'll live different but if it's just something in our mind something in our mouth it's not going to do anything but if we truly believe it in our heart it's going to change Our Lives amen now I read this quotee and I want to start I I I read it last service because I want us to find a real foundation for our Christian walk in this series that's what I'm really getting at here I want it for me and I want it for you and I'm not saying you don't have it if you do have it let's confirm it and if you don't have it let's get you on the right foundation and man let's get us to where we need to be because I'm seeking a greater reality every day I want a greater reality of Christ in my life I want to see more of him and I want to see less of me that's what a reality is more of him less of me amen and if if I can see that then everything else that we look for every other promise we look for every sign every wonder it follows there but it the more that I can get me out of the picture and more of him into the picture the more I'm going to see Christ the word reflected in my life amen so I'm not preaching to you today I'm preaching to me and you happen to be the beneficiaries of it I think Amen brother Braham said this he says you might go through life living a good Christian Life you might belong to some church you might have a fine membership you might be a moral character and all of that but brother that still isn't Christianity Christianity is when the Holy Ghost has taken full possession full possession of you and you're led by the holy spirit so in other words the Difference Maker for us is not our morality amen it's not our knowledge it's not even what we call our our Revelation it's not the church we attend it's not the ministry we sit under that is not the Difference Maker the Difference Maker is when the Holy Ghost is inside of me that's what makes all the difference in all of this amen it's the difference makers when the Holy Spirit has the preeminence in you and me and that brings us into adoption that's what brings us to where we're going in this service amen and if we're ever going to be used of God we've got to find us in a place where we've let go and he's got the preeminence where he's the one that's making the decisions in our life amen we've got to come to the place where we die so completely that our Everly inclination is to get away from ourselves and find out what his word says about what we're going through in life that ought to be what we're looking for amen now I don't know about you but that's a challenge for me because so easily what happens is is if we're we're doing well and we get up in the morning and we have our devotions and we have our prayer time and we're all set guess what Satan coming to me right after that usually doesn't get anywhere but give me a couple hours anden give me a little bit of time to get worked up about something or get tired or get cranky or have something not go the way I thought it should go let somebody drop some bad news on me and now we've got a real Challenge on our hands to say what is it that God God would have me do in the situation because I've stepped away from the presence that was there that morning we want to find a time and a place where we can be in his presence all day long where we have ready access to it where we understand that we have access to the throne room that we have access to the shikina presence of God and in doing so we can access him for any situation we've got in our life amen I love how brother Bram talks about David he says when David came to Goliath he didn't have to get prayed up he didn't have to go down and have devotions he didn't have to make anything right he was ready to go when the when the giant came across his path he was ready for whatever came across his path that day amen so we've got to realize this isn't a battle that's flesh and blood when when when people don't agree with us when when things don't go our way when sickness comes our way or differences or or when there's a lack in our life somehow this is not a flesh and blood matter amen it's a spiritual battle that's what we're wrestling against it's a supernatural conflict that we're dealing with every day and that means we need a supernatural atmosphere and we need a supernatural mindset to go through life and be an overcomer in this age amen so the winners and the losers are not based on intelligence knowledge influence money understanding it's influenced by who's in line with the word and who's out of line with the word because the word can never fail and if you're in line with the word then that's all that matters amen so that means we've got to stay close to the word we've got to be checking in with God not just daily but throughout the day amen it's a it's a good thing to stop and take a break from things that we're doing and just sit back and and and and maybe even it's as simple as just pray about a need in the church think about somebody other than yourself once in a while and I'm not saying that as a as a as a put down I'm saying put a bit of time into those around you bring a need before the Lord maybe it's yours maybe it's somebody else but break up your schedule a bit to give God a little bit of time and remind yourself let yourself know I'm a Child of God and whatever I'm doing I'm a Child of God when I'm doing it and I need to be found walking in that in a day-by-day place Amen Brother John Andy shared this with me and I thought it was a great quote he says and we should not be just gatting about from place to place now we don't know what gatting about means I had to look it up I I guessed what it meant but here's what it means it means to go around from one place to another in the pursuit of pleasure or entertainment so we're not out looking for a good time all the time he says we should always go and consider the Lord before we go do you do that when you leave home pray Lord help me to have a safe journey over where I'm going and back ordering my steps today that I'll not step out of your blessed path how many want to live in the will of God I want to live in the will of God but watch what he says but if I should make the wrong move we're going to make the wrong move sometimes church but if I should make the wrong move maybe we should put it this way when I make the wrong move Lord you'll warn me and bring me back into the right way again amen it's easy to get hauled out it's easy to get diverted just a little bit off the path he says but if you'll warn me and bring me back into the right way again if my tongue should start to speak things that was not right will you just stop my tongue from speaking you know so often we want the other person to shut up how about Lord shut me up Lord help me to be quiet Lord still my tongue who can who can control the tongue the scripture says it's a mighty thing it's a small thing but it's a mighty thing he says bring me back into the right place again we can't control the other person we can't control the situation all we can control is oursel Lord bring me back to where I need to be and if I should start thinking wrong thoughts will you just change my way of thinking and let me think the right things this is in the message hear ye him brother B talks a lot about adoption this is what takes you to adoption he says what you think is usually what you do that means you got to get your thoughts right and if you can get your thoughts right then usually what follows will be the right thing that's the greatest battle ever fought brother Braham said was for the minds of men what are you going to think and will you take on the mind of Christ which is subject to the word or will you leave the the the the mindset of your own Humanity in there to give yourself all the reasons to be as worked up as you are or as down as you are as the case may be he says you know if you'll do right that's your duty to God God expects us to do the right thing but he says if you'll think right that's your duty to yourself CU you can control that you can decide how you're going to spend your time what goes on up there remember he said you can't stop a bird from flying over your head but you can stop it from building a nest and Satan's going to drop thoughts in your head all day long he's going to try and put ideas there he's going to try and put you know we call it discernment but a lot of times it's just bias personal preference or opinion and he'll try and put that in and what you'll have is the holy spirit sitting there saying but the word of God says if you'll say what does the word say because otherwise Satan will work your ear off over here he says if you'll think right that's your duty to yourself and you got to come out right you can't be going east when you're going west east when you're going west you can't be going wrong when you're going right or vice versa he says think right do right you'll be right amen he says Jesus our lord as he walked here on Earth he did not just go about from place to place with great entertainment and the Applause of men and the applauding of the audiences and of the great flowery things that the men of this world or the teachers would Praise Him by but every footstep that he made was ordered by the Lord he says oh I just love that when he said even at 12 years old young people listen up even as a young person he said know ye not that I must be about my father's business how that brings us then to shame when we're so all the time gading about and the Bible said that the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord now catch this he says we should walk in his ordination for us walk like a Christian talk like a Christian live like a Christian so we're going to talk about this a bit more when we get into more on the adoption side of things but I want to say this brothers and sisters you don't just go to work every day that's a worldly thought Lord I'm going to go into work help me to make a good living today that's the way the world approaches it what you've got to say is Lord help me to be a light for you in the place that you've given me to make a living because you're the only light that this world has you're the only word you're the only Bible that most people ever going to see or read and we are the ones that they've got to see and If all we're doing is going in and coming out without the mindset that the sons of God are led by the spirit of God then we forget that we're doing something of Eternal purpose everywhere we go whether it's in a grocery store whether it's at your job whether it's in home school the people we run into every one of them is looking at us and we're supposed to be a witness in a testimony we're supposed to be showing forth the glory of God Amen so we don't just go to work work we ought to be saying every time we leave the door Lord help me to have an eternal impact on somebody's life today help people to see Christ in me help them to look past me help me to stay in your presence so that they have access help me to keep my mind right help me to keep my tongue in check help me to keep my attitude right so that somebody else has an opportunity at the eternal life that I so freely enjoy on a daily basis amen we're all ministers in that regard we're serving those that are around us by keeping the right attitude and the right spirit and expressing the word of this day through our lives amen I referenced this scripture earlier just a moment ago and and Peter said this he says but ye are a chosen generation you're here now today CU God chose you to be here today that means he's meant for you to express something that nobody else could express except you in the place you're in the relationships you're in the sphere of influence you have whatever it might be he's made you to be doing what you're doing today each one as individuals he says you're a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people why that you should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light that's why I said there has to be a difference you can't walk in darkness and walk in light the same way you ever have to get up in the middle of the night and you thump yourself I've gotten to the place where I can do just about anything in the dark in my room but but I've been in that room so many times in the dark but if you're trying to get around in the dark you're going to bump you're going to be one of those things that goes bump in the night usually with a muttering after that right there's a difference how you walk when there's lots of light I could run as fast as I wanted in here turn out the lights and I don't think I'd do so well right we'd hear a really big Echo as I hit that and that and that and that what we walk different when we come into these things amen but if we'd have that mindset that we're walking out the door or we're going to the shed quarters or we're going down to the basement every interaction we have is supposed to show forth the Praises of the glory of the one that's called us out of darkness and into light that would change my mindset if I was thinking that every single morning Lord let me show your glory today to somebody somehow if all my failures with all my faults with all my flaws Lord let somebody see you and me today that it changeed the way we approach things I believe amen that we'd be a better witness like I said sons of God are led by the spirit of God and that means if you are living right and you're making word decisions then you're led by the spirit of God you'll do it and that means that wherever you're at today whatever you're doing he's got a purpose for you to be there and it's not just to make a living it's not just to be comfortable but it's to show Christ to a Dying World that needs it amen listen if we can if we can live right if we can we can live by the word if we can be led by God we can see Eternal consequences out of everything we do every day it builds up and the smallest things can turn into the greatest decisions for people so many times brother B he's talking in the message Divine love and Sovereign Grace and he's talking about Israel at the Red Sea he says this because remember children of God are led by the spirit of God the pillar of fire LED them to the Red Sea and it looked like that was the end of all things he said no matter what comes or goes God orders it are you a child of God this evening then if you have stayed with the word then whatever God has ordered in your life it's by him it's not by you it's by him he says maybe through trials and it may be through troubles and tribulations but as long as God's leading what difference does it make he said now tell them to stand still they love me and they're projecting to me by proving that they believe me to step out on my word and they believe it and now they're at the end of the road love has taken them as far as it can so now I will project to them they projected love to me I'll project my divine grace and power to them and said tell them that they're at the end they can't do no more can't swim away can't run away you can't climb away you got mountains on both sides you got an army behind you and you got an unswimmable ocean in front of you you can't do a thing he says but they still love me and they believe me so my grace will work work now in this case he says it'll work tonight in your case it'll work in every case watch him then what took place God caused an East Wind to come down Moses didn't do a thing but walk right down to the seashore or the side of the Red Sea and just wave His Hands Across that's the way he says what Moses did just wave your hands that's it what was there something magical in the moving of Moses hands no he just did what God told him to do why you crying to me Moses why cry speak and go forth tell the people to get ready to go forth he says the sea went back what happened the pillar of fire was giving them light and leading them turned around and stood between them and the danger and to them it was Darkness to Israel it was light all night long he said I'm so glad that there's blessed Holy Light when the world's walking in darkness the Christian walks in the beautiful light of the Holy Spirit amen we're preaching on the spirit of light today and I want you to see how to walk in this light as we spoke about last service we we read the scripture that said if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all of our sins so you say brother John how do I walk in the light I'll tell you this it's not complicated but it's a challenge I find that's often the times with the way it works with the gospel it's not it's not that it's not understood it's that we don't pick up the challenge it's not difficult it's not complicated it's not hard to understand but we let ourselves down we don't step into it the way that we ought to remember the scripture says the life of light life of God is the light of man so this all starts with the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost you can't have the spirit of light without the Holy Ghost you can't walk in light you can't do it you've got to have him there with you amen and there's a working of the Holy Spirit we'll talk a bit about this afternoon and we've talked about that in the the seven attributes from Faith all the way through brotherly kindness and that brings light into our lives but that's not what makes us a Christian what makes us a Christian is when he's in our lives not just when the light's shining on us because that just makes us bright but when the light is in us that makes us a light house that makes us a light it doesn't give us light it makes us a light remember what Jesus said in Matthew he said ye are the light of the world we read the scripture where he says I'm the light of the world now he says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid and neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the House Church that means that you can hide all you want at work remember the story about that guy that came back from being off in in some camp for for a whole summer and and he when he came back he says boy I did good they didn't know I was a Christian the whole time I was there that ought to be a shame if nobody knows we're a Christian anden he says you're going to be set up he says you don't put a candle under a bushel you don't put it under a Bas basket but you put it on a Candlestick so it will give light amen God's put us where we are to give light amen we are light we are a lighthouse because the Holy Spirit dwells inside of us he says NE he says but let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works not just good words good works he says and glorify your father which is in heaven so being in light doesn't make you a light that just makes you lit up you have to have light inside of you in order to become a light Amen to become a lighthouse of if we want to put it that way amen you've got to have it attached to you you got to have it inside of you so that when you move the light goes with you amen so if you're walking in light it's because the light is with you amen it's it's attached to you it's not just enough to be in an atmosphere you can be in an atmosphere and never have the Holy Ghost don't run away from the atmosphere but the atmosphere is not what saves you the Holy Ghost in you is what saves you amen that's what we're looking for amen we've got to have God With Us not in us not just with us now the prophet would preach on this idea of coming into the presence of God and being in the light of God in the message why are people so tossed about and and I think it's a key title because so often we're struggling and it seems like we can't keep our heads above water seems like we can't maintain momentum we get distracted we get pulled aside and we say what's going on brother B would say you've either let the anchor go or you never had one in the first place and sometimes we have to admit maybe we aren't so anchored in that part of our life sometimes we got to realize I don't have the Holy Ghost or if I had it I've stepped away from it we can walk away from that we can push him away we don't lose our Salvation just CU you're tossed about doesn't mean you're not a child of God just means you're out of position that's all that's happening amen but brother Brandon would approach it and he's talking about coming into the the shika Glory the the glory of God and he look at it from a tabernacle standpoint and if you look at a a view of the Tabernacle and this is the Tabernacle of the Wilderness this is the Tabernacle of Moses in the Old Testament and he he would look at this and he'd say there's light in every aspect of this Tabernacle and you see here you have the outer Court which is all on the outside and then you have an actual building and inside you have the inner court and then you have the holy of holies but each one of those has a measure of light and he'd say that's the way the Christian is is as you go further and further with God you're in light but the light changes as you go through it but he said there's only one light that's always on there's only one light that never fails there's only one light you can trust every single day of your life and that's in the holy of holies but he start on the outer coat and he says now there's three courts the Justified man out here in the outer Court he walks by daylight some days he has gloomy days some days are gloomy some days you wonder whether it's really worthwhile to serve God or not he says you're walking in the outer courts sure you're eating Mana sure you're a Believer sure you have eternal life sure if you die you go to heaven truly he says but what kind of a life are you living he's not tearing down your Christianity he's saying where are you at in your Christianity he says every day oh get out of here and oh I got my dander up today I told them about it I cussed them out I couldn't help it God forgive me ever been there he say sure he will certainly he will you're his child remember where you are is not a reflection of who you are unless you stay there right remember the scripture says a righteous man falls seven times but he keeps getting up he falls seven times and he gets up seven times guess what he gets up dirty he gets up tired he gets up worn out he gets fed up with himself but he keeps getting up where he is is not a reflection of who he is unless he stays down there he says but what kind of a life are you living my don't you hate to live that kind of a life the ups and downs there are trouble and a poll day and night backslid and back to church backslid and back to church this that and apologize for this over here he says this other fellow's just blooming right along and not a thing see he's drawing a contrast you're in the outer courts this man's someplace else he says what kind of a light is he walking in the one that's in and out is the one he's talking about he says it's according to the weather it give the light outside the gloomy the foggy the halfway then a bright day then a gloomy and a foggy and a cloud over the sun what's he saying he's saying light circumstances are determining whether you're a child of God on those days or how much of a child of God you are on those days one day you're in church to next you're backsliding one day you're cussing out and the next day you're nice and and and right is rain it's an external thing that's controlling you amen you haven't changed but you've let your environment change your attitude your approach your thoughts all of these different things and you come out of it and you're not looking so good brother says that's the way the regenerated Justified man lives that's right that's all all the light he has to walk in when he's just walking by that you say I come to Christ I join the church I put my name on the book I'm trying to live the best I can that's that's that's the person in the outer Court I'm doing the best I can why because it's only him that's doing it nothing wrong with it but it's not the highest level of light you can live in don't stop trying your best church just realize that your best is never going to be enough don't stop trying but don't rest in your trying you rest in the perfect sacrifice of Calvary he says well bless your heart brother I appreciate that God appreciates that if you believe he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life you're my brother I love you but oh my my ups and downs oh my I'm the most miserable person I have to fight every day oh yes brother that's where you're walking that's all right then you say well I want to go a little deeper deeper church if we want to go deeper that means there's deeper we can go if we want more of God that means there's more of God to be have if we want to get closer to God that means there's a closeness that we can have to God Amen we don't have to live in a in a life where we're tossed about on a daily basis doesn't mean the storms won't come but their effect won't be the same as you walk into a greater light as you get closer to God Amen am man if we can we can just stop being tossed around and there's realize there's a place where in the body that Christ has made just for you where you can be solid you don't have to get knocked about and you can just rest in him amen I want you to notice though as we go through these courts that the further you go the smaller the court gets why is that CU only certain people were allowed to go in certain places the outer Court just about anybody could be there not everyone just about everyone but as soon as you go into the inner Court well that's only for the priesthood any priest could go in there but then you get into the holy holies and that's only needs room for one man once a year but you'll see in our life cuz remember when Christ died and he split the veil access is open for all and so the difference is not who is called it's who's willing if I can put it that way we're called you've got to be called we're a royal priesthood we're told to go into every aspect of this but this is truly whosoever will but you've got to go as far as you want to go because the thing you'll realize is the further you go the less your excuses hold up the further you go the it drops away because you can't say I didn't know or and he wasn't there to help me no the closer you get to him the more the excuses drop away because now it's got to be him that's doing it not you and so you can't say well I can't do it of course you can't do it none of us can do it but I've come in closer to him and now he's doing it in me and then when you get into the beginning into the very end it's him in me it's not just him doing it but it's him in me it's not just him working on me but it's him working in me now it's him that's actually doing these things in our lives amen but you can't go any further than you want to go amen the road Narrows the walls close in why cuz you're transitioning out of yourself and into Christ brother Brown would talk about that caterpillar remember he says and he goes through different stages and can you imagine knowing you're meant to be a butterfly and saying I choose to be a a caterpillar a miserable little worm the rest of your life right funky hair spots and everything and you could be a beautiful butterfly not Earthbound able to go anywhere you want anytime you want what a miserable thing it would be Amen brother brah says this but when he comes into the inner court now what's in there he says there's seven golden candlesticks by the holy place and it's giving light candlesticks are giving light that's to the man who quits his drinking quits his smoking quits lying quits stealing treats his neighbor right he's good to his wife or her good to her husband the same way man or woman the believer he has come to a place where he has quit all of his meanness which is through the blood with sanctification he says he's called to a new life and he walks in there he don't have to walk by that light out there he's got a better light not the best light he's got a better light he says he's walking by the light of seven golden candlesticks which is burning olive oil and the olive oil was representing the holy spirit so we look in here and we have the inner court and then we have the holy of holies Beyond it so you see there's a curtain in the front this is a cutaway view as you can see and in there now you got the seven golden candlesticks and he says now you've come to a place where there's light all the time there's no gloomy days there's no sunny days but there's light all the time there's always light there but he said the fire now was the baptism which baptized IES you even baptized out in there with the Holy Spirit but you're not hid away yet this is the sanctifying work of the holy spirit this isn't the new birth this is the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit he says you're not hid away yet you're not behind the veil here he is he says he's walking in these seven golden candlesticks there's much light in there but there's days he says when them lights gets dull there's days when them lamps smoke and the light is not so good there's times when them lights have to be relit again and you have to borrow from the neighbor to Light One Candle to the other it's still not a good light we're thankful for it but it's not the right light he says this is what this place looks like he says you say brother I've spoken in tongues I've shouted good wonderful but let me tell you something different all right he's walking in this light but it's an artificial light now he says what's in there it's olive oil which represents the Holy Spirit what's artificial about the Holy Spirit nothing you know what's artificial the fire that lights it and the people that light it we're the artificial part because the light that's in there is dependent on us maintaining it there's not an unending supply of olive oil in those candlesticks it has to be topped up on a daily basis hourly basis perhaps I don't know how fast it went through but the the the rule was you couldn't let the light out but it was dependent on us not falling asleep not forgetting keeping things topped up keeping them clean keeping them trimmed it was all on us as humans as priests to keep the light going that's what makes it artificial is it's on us and it can go out if we don't do our part he says it's not the light of the Sun the light of the moon or the Stars the man in the Justified courts when Night comes he has a very dim light just maybe the stars and maybe a Pale Moon a lot of flying clouds he's in an awful fix but the man up here at the altar notice you've got an altar in there he says who keeps himself under Consecration and says Lord I'm going to live right by you I'm the Deacon in the church or something or another I'm going to live good to my neighbor I'm going to try my best to do better Lord while he's living in a better light his lights seldom go out but they still go out he says but they do smoke up and they have to light one from the other see the Candlestick is the humanity part and they're made of gold and it's supposed to represent deity but here they're representing us and the Holy Spirit needs brings the light but we need the cleaning cuz we get blocked up we need the trimming we get dried out the problem's not the oil the problem is the candlesticks amen that's us in there brother randam will point us back to Zechariah 4 1-6 and and the angel would would talk to Zachariah about this and he'd say here is another lamp of pure gold of course the oil typifies the Holy Ghost who alone can give the light of God to the people the angel who spoke to Zachariah was as much as saying this what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost amen this is still only under sanctification you can have gifts speak with tongues you can have signs and wonders you can have all of these things he says but you're still not there yet it's good and it's a better light and it rarely goes out but it does fail from time to time because we fail amen so we see here that the holy spirit is actually dependent on us keeping our lives clean it's dependent on us making the right decision it's depending on us because we're still not in behind the veil we're the one that keeps the fire alive in our lives amen and that's when you go like brother B would say you go from revival to Revival and in between you're a miserable Christian or you're less than overcoming if I could put it that way that's not the Walk of a True Believer that you got to go to Revival after Revival there's a consistency there's a steadiness that comes when you're sealed away because you're not dependent on anything except the presence of Christ in your life amen so this here is an imperfect light and it's imperfect because of us and not the Holy Ghost but then but the scripture says let us go on under Perfection and we can sit here and we can say this is good I like where I'm at my life's cleaned up that's a good place to be where our lives are cleaned up but that's not it that's not it now you got to fill what's been cleaned what's been emptied out has to have something put into it amen and there's a place and a position of absolute rest that's available to the believer amen and it's independent of me and it's independent of you and it's independent of what's going on in our lives in that particular day and there's a place where we can take ourselves completely out of the equation and say Lord my life is in your hands and I'm trusting you but that is a battle don't get me wrong it's a battle but there is a place of rest amen Hebrews 4 says that it's our Sabbath he says but the man who walks beyond that and goes in don't just stand on the edge go in he says when the world is shut off when the veil drops around him down under the Locking of the wings of the cherabin the great shikina Glory hung under there it never got dim it never went out he said and the man who lives in the presence of God under the veil lives in the shakana glory I don't care if the storms are raging whether the clouds or the moon don't shine the Stars don't shine whether the Candlestick goes out that doesn't matter he said he is living in the shakina glory of God under the power of the Holy Ghost it didn't go out at night it didn't go out period why because this is its own source of life it is its own source of light it's not dependent on you it's not dependent on me it is self- sustaining this is a light that is always there no matter what the sun moon and stars are going to go away but that light is going to always be there brother R would point us to the holy of holies and we see in here there's no light it maybe a bit hard to see in here but there's no lights in the holy of holies in the very back there's the word there's The Mercy Seat there's blood on it and then it's the presence of God it's the word the word the word that's all that's in there it's the living presence of God in there and that means the light never goes out can you imagine being a priest and you got that Candlestick behind you and as beautiful as it is and you open this and there is no light source but yet there is a light that the pillar of fire is in there and no matter what time you go in it's never out it's never dimmed it never changes it's an everpresent source of life and light and in that light in that life in that presence the Mana never got stale and the Almond the the the stick that was dead the almond stick that was always dead buted and produced used almonds year round there's no death there there's no dissatisfaction there's no unrest it's just peace and life and joy in that presence amen he says it didn't go out he says it's kind of a Mystic light kind of a soft glowing light he says and the believer at rest walks around inside The Veil The shikina Glory where the PO Mana was where he ate daily never gave out he ate from the man oh my he had not a worry in the world everything was taken care of God was over him listening to him praise and answering his prayer cuz remember he went in there for his own soul for his own sins and then he came in and he was pleading for everybody else church when you get taken care of don't forget about the ones that are still outside waiting to get in there don't forget that there's people that need us to go in before that presence and stay there until they can come in for them El till they can come to their M their own mind they can come to themselves like that prodal son did and they can say Lord now I'm here now I've got my own access and I don't need Mom and Dad I don't need pop and Nan but I'm here now what listening to your praise and answering your prayer amen you enter his gates with Thanksgiving in your hearts and his courts with praise thank him don't turn him into a sugar daddy say thank you Lord thank you for what you've done thank you for what you're doing but Lord I'm coming and there's others that have needs as well not just me he said God was over him listening to him praise and answering his prayer not only that but he is living right in the presence of the king God in the shikina glory he said every time anything would start up like that it couldn't get to him he wouldn't listen to it he couldn't the wines of the world were on the outside church that's where I want to be every single day we got a lot of whining going on in this world we lot got a lot of dark talk a lot of Doomsday talk listen they're right the Earth is not going to hell in the hand basket it's there already it's going down brother B she's off the skids and there's no coming back she's been judged there's no coming back he's dealing with individuals now it's done okay there there's no saving this world but if the world is going down that mean the bride ought to be looking up amen remember scripture says he comes to those that love his appearing we ought to be able to read the signs of the times and say Lord the time is getting closer than it ever was before Lord I'm looking to you Lord I'm trusting in you Lord I'm expecting you that ought to be the way we're approaching every single day amen he says if you ever come into Christ my friend ever into a place where the world is dead where whether your children are this or whether your mother's this way your daddy said this whether your pastor said that whether the doctor said this or that you don't even hear it you live only in the shikina glory walking and living in the presence of the king every day is sweet to your soul I want a day where I can say this is sweet to my soul every day I don't think I'm there yet but Lord I there I believe there's a way to get there amen we're going to talk about that in a little bit he says my all is well all is well there is nothing can harm you oh what a place then he continues he says I go to church for one thing and that's to stay in your presence I moved in there Lord I never desire to leave again I'll Trust your word what you say there is where I want to be drop the veils around me Lord that I could only see Jesus alone and live and walk and die in him he says there you are he says oh God God hide me in that place hide me over in that place where all the veils will drop and I'll see nothing but Jesus himself I don't want to hear the Fantastics of the world I don't care whether they got atomic bombs whether they got a Jet Plane whether the new Chevrolets look better than the Buicks it doesn't matter the thing of it is I'm walking and living with Christ daily and I've died to self and the veils are dropped around and I in he and he and me Church we're coming to the place where we have to know who we are we've got to know that we are children of God we are sons of God we are Daughters of God that we are part of a finished work that we have a security as a child of God that nothing that Satan does can hinder he can't hold you back you've already been you've already there you've already been seen there we're already in Heavenly places in Christ and there's nothing can harm us there's nothing can hold us back nothing can keep us from the love of God working what the word has said about each and every one of us the only thing that'll slow it is what we allow and even that won't stop it it'll only hinder it cuz God will get you to a place like that prodical son remember where you come to yourself and say I don't have to live like this I don't have to look like this I don't have to deal with this I don't have to think like this and you'll die to yourself and you'll come back to the father's house and you'll be right back on the road to glory nothing's going to stop us from making a church nothing's going to stop us not even ourselves brother said you go might go all kinds of emotions carry on every way and call it in the name of religion the heathens do the same thing he says but give me a consecrated life that's dead and rose again in Christ Jesus who lives in the shikina glory with the love of God around them he said that's the person I'll believe is going to be there put me beneath the veil under the blood of the Lord Jesus take all your gifts that you have in the scripture the devil can impersonate every one of them but he can't impers personate love cuz Love's genuine the devil can't love that's one thing he can't do we can't be wondering do I have the Holy Ghost let's make our calling and election sure let's say we've got it and make sure we've got it and if we don't got it let's press till we got it CU if you don't have the Holy Ghost Church you're not going anywhere that is the only thing that's required we'll get into it when we we talk a little bit more about perfect love because only perfect love can go there and that's the holy ghost that that's you reuniting with the rest of the pillar of fire that's what's happening that's the only checkbox that they tick when you cross over Holy Ghost yes Holy Ghost no Holy Ghost yes you go up Holy Ghost no you go and you wait for final judgment it's the only thing that matters Church the token is the only thing that matters it's the only thing that takes us across amen we've got to start listening to The Cry of our heart rather than the desires of this flesh crucify It Die daily like Paul said I'm not talking about New Year's resolutions or commitments or these things but a sincere and genuine cry that says Lord I Want More not not a selfish more but I want to be where you want me to be I want to act like you want me to act I want you to live like you want me to live I want to live in your promises I want to live in your presence I want to live in your love and your joy and your peace and not settle for anything else amen you say how can I do that brother John who would say I want to be closer to God I want to be closer to God how do I do it how do we do it Church we've got to come to our own personal experience for starts you got to have your own experience with God Amen and you've got to press you've got to press familiar scripture in Matthew 11 it says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and and the violent take it by force now if you remember I preached on this very early on when I moved to New Finland I had to look it up it was a second service I preached when I moved back from British Columbia and I I suggest you go and listen to it and it'll help you it's called taking the kingdom by force I preached on August 16 2020 if you're trying to find it but the reason I'm referencing it is because you got to realize that there's a pressing in you had each of these courts you had to choose to walk further nobody forced you you had to walk from the outer Court to the inner court and from the inner Court into the holy of holies you have to choose you had to press and guess what they had thick thick uh drapes curtains that were there and these weren't little tiny you know the little ones we have the Lacy ones in in our windows and that these were big heavy curtains cuz the idea was that they were soundproof that was the purpose was to shut out everything every exterior noise every exterior light everything was supposed to be shut out so that it was just you and God but you got to press you got to press through those things amen listen Satan presses on us it says there the violent take it our take it by force Satan has no problem getting violent with us does he it's about time we got violent with him we're armored for it we've got a weapon for it how about we get violent with him the way he likes to get violent with us but not with hate but with the promise of God in our lips and in our t testimony to say I'm here to take what belongs to me I'm here to live the life that he's called me to live amen where are we pressing what are we pressing to get where are we violent in our intentions where have we gotten serious lately I'm preaching to myself here Church by that I mean who or what are we trying to overcome what are we trying to achieve what are we trying to get what are we trying to get rid of whatever the case may be what is it that we are getting forceful with with amen where's our Victory where's our rejoicing by that I say where is it not do we have it but where are we rejoicing where we're rejoicing and where we're declaring Victory tells us where we've been fighting where your celebration is that's probably where you've been using some force and by force I mean trusting the word of God using the word of God believing the word of God putting it on your lips putting it on your mind that's how you know where you've been pressing is where you've gotten Victory lately amen this isn't a selfish intention but we're talking about coming into our position in our walk with God where he means for us to be that's all saying Lord I'm going to press into what you have for me and leave the rest of this behind amen we've got to get deliberate about it that's one thing I've noticed as I've been studying these things is that it takes deliberate intention this isn't Hocus Pocus we've got choice choices to make and we decide how our day goes so many times it's our choice how we start it and how we go through it and how we finish it so often is about us because remember the scripture says we read it a couple Services ago God hasn't changed his arm hasn't gotten short that he can't save he's not deaf that he can't hear us the problem is never God the problem is are we accessing him are we using him are we going to him are we trusting him the way that we're supposed to amen so it starts with a deliberation in our heart and our soul and then it comes out in everything else amen when we say Lord I want to be in your presence on a daily basis brother Brandon puts it this way he said Solomon said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you say I don't like where I am what's in your heart cuz you are where you are because of that's where your heart being or that's where you've chosen to focus he says begin begin to think that you're one of his children that he saved you and he's good to you and you love him and he loves you we're talking about how do we walk in the light how do we come into the presence of God Church begin by thinking you're one of his children now I hope you are but his point is if you are start thinking about it start thinking about the fact that God has not just called you but he's chosen you he's predestinated you he's elected you to be a part of an end time bride he says in that you're one of his children and he saved you he's good to you and you love him and he loves you now catch says don't just wait till you go to church or some convenient hour just keep him on your mind all the time and he's actually talking about Mary you know Mary and Joseph Mary he says and as she went on walking down the street there was no one yet on the street and as she walked along the little dirt path for a sidewalk all of a sudden she began to realize that there was something around her a real strange feeling oh that's the most wonderful experience he says I trust that everybody here has experience them kind of times he says if you haven't this will be a good night to start you know I hope brother Doug and sister Beverly don't mind me saying this but I was at their house when I when I was gone hunting of course a couple weeks ago and I went to use the bathroom and as soon as I was in the bathroom for 15 seconds they both broke out into songs completely different songs but they broke into songs you know why it is because whenever get a quiet moment what do they start do they start praising God and it just happens I don't believe brother dog and sister Beverly I don't even think you know that you're doing it but they both started singing completely different songs and then when I came out they shut up and we went back to fellowshipping why because there was something in their heart that yearned to be in the presence of God and that was giving him praise and worship all the time and every time I've been out with brother Doug and sister Beverly in the car or in their home they start singing eventually why because there's something inside of him that wants to draw close to God and it keeps him in a right atmosphere it keeps him in a right attitude it keeps him in a right frame of mind it was a good lesson for me I do it too if I go in the shower if I get a quiet time I'll start whistling or singing I like to do it but not all of us like to do it but we ought to do it and this is what brother Brandon's saying you've got to start doing something to draw towards God you got to take a step towards God and guess up worship and praise is a good way to start it you can do that you say I don't feel like it that's why you worship cuz worship has nothing to do with how you feel and everything to do with who he is and what he is now praise Praises for what he does worship for who he is you can worship him anytime church cuz he's always God he's always good he's always great he's always powerful we can worship him all day long it has nothing to do with how life's going now praise praise tends to be more dependent doesn't it but you'll see that they LED them in Praise when they went into the battle the priesthood would lead them into praise when they go out in the battle and that was to set their hearts right to get the victory Amen brother Braham says this we're talking how do I come into the presence of God how do I dwell in the presence of God he says just start thinking about him and worship him in your heart and all of a sudden you'll feel the close Fellowship of the holy spirit all around you he didn't say immediately he says one minute he's not there the next he is there it's not that he was never churches that you maybe didn't realize he wasn't there but all of a sudden now you're in a place where you can recognize the presence of God remember we talked about it I don't know if it last service a couple Services ago how even the prophet remember he got wound up CU Jehoshaphat was doing another thing with another king he shouldn't have and then they got stuck in the desert 7 days out no water no food and they said to the prophet we need help and he says call me a Minstrel call me a musician cuz I'm just not happy and then the minstrel the musician put him in an an atmosphere where he could hear the right words from God you can put yourself in the right attitude start singing some songs if you can't sing let somebody else sing for you turn it on he says all of a sudden you'll feel the close Fellowship of the holy spirit all around you and it gets so anointed till you can't hold it any longer you'll raise up your hands or do something you just can't stand still when it comes and as she was thinking not noticing who is around her the little lady perhaps with a pair of sandals on her feet while walking along this little Dusty path but thinking of the Lord and of his promises of things to come and as she was sinking all of a sudden that feeling got so great around her till she raised up her head and when she did standing before her was a light and standing by that light was Gabriel the Angel the Archangel of God he said if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and off the things things of the world go about your business go to your church go to your washing of dishes wherever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long he says then God will do something you're drawing close to him you've got the world shut out it's just you and he are together listen Paul and Silas sang and prayed while in the prison stocks now I don't know about you I haven't been in prison socks lately I haven't been in cold heart stone in a in a stinky drafty jail in a long time ever basically if they can sing and they can worship and they can praise and they can pray in that what's our excuse have things gotten so bad remember Paul said you haven't resisted till you bled yet I think sometimes we Elevate our pain and our suffering and it's because we don't want to actually get out of it really we want to stay in our little poor me thing rather than saying there's a higher plane for me to live there's a different way that I can go through this situation I can go through it with a lot different attitude if I'll just press a little if I'll fight a little if you can't focus on the on pushing the situation away focus on lifting God up to where he is amen Elevate him he deserves our glory and our praise focus on him and pretty soon you'll find you'll start to come right along with it remember what I said it's not complicated but it's challenging this is what we're talking about Paul and Silas would do it church I've had remember brother B says you get where you can't hold it in any longer raise up your hands or something I've had that happen in my car I've had that happen at my desk while studying I've had that happen in my comfy little chair that I use for my devotions I've had that driving back and forth to Grand Falls hunting I've had it happen out in the woods it doesn't matter where you are you put your mind on him and you start dwelling on the things of God and he comes your way you say well I'm I'm just some I'm down I'm depleted listen on the road to Emmas they were sad and weary but they were talking about him and brother Bram says when you talk about him he tends to come along that's it church is it hard it's not it's not hard to understand but it's hard to do it's hard to say I'm going to lay down my right to be upset to be sad to be worried to be depressed to be stressed and say Lord I'm going to lift you up for a while I'm going to start talking about you I'm going to start thinking good things I'm going to start dwelling on the things you've done for me and see where that takes me I mean if we're not happy where we're at it doesn't hurt to try to go someplace else does it it's not that hard but it's a choice it's deliberate it's deliberate every single time and I'll tell you when God drops in and I've shared some of those moments with this church and I preached from moments 15 seconds in the presence of God will change your day for weeks it's the way it works because he doesn't just come down to be there he comes down with purpose he comes down with intention he comes there to speak I have learned things I have heard things I have understood things in a way I've never before just with a a short moment when he's there and I know he's there I know that I know that I know he's there and it changes your outlook it changes your approach it changes your attitude it humbles you it settles you and you walk away a different person and the goal is to be a different person every day of Our Lives Amen to win the battle with this flesh because it's a battle every single day what if we could press into that every day it's not a question of can we it's a question of will we God said I'll never leave you or forsake you it reminds me of the story and I think many men have shared this and I don't know who started it but you know this man and his wife were married for quite some time and they always had a pickup truck with a bench seat and you know after 20 years she looked at them from over in the far seat she said honey she said how come you know you don't cuddle up to me in the truck anymore you where'd the love go he said honey I'm in the same seat I've always been in God ain't moved church God ain't moved we move we take ourselves away he's there you know we we sing that song Standing somewhere in the shadows you'll find Jesus where right where you left him he hasn't left he hasn't walked away he hasn't grown cold he hasn't Lost That Loving Feeling we have we pull away we get distracted we decide something else is worth our time our effort our praise our energy and what happens is we lose Lo the victory we lose the victory over our attitude we lose the victory over our thoughts we Lo the lose the victory over our love for the brothers and sisters and then we got to fight all the harder to get back but it's still got to be a pressing Choice every single day amen if we could just turn off the phones put the books away just get quiet for a little bit each day and say Lord I'm here to be in your presence and not just on your time remember but throughout your day cuz we don't have all day to do it we can't sit around all day waiting for the presence of God we've got obligations we've got family obligations we've got job obligations but throughout your day let them know Lord I'm thinking of you and if you struggle with that do what the good Germans do and plug it into your phone and remind yourself to stop every little bit throughout the day and pretty soon you'll find you start doing it just automatically just stop and say Lord I love you Lord I'm thinking about brother Ivan Lord you see sisters so and so Lord you remember this situation Lord thank you for what you've done thank you that what I've been praying about for weeks for years you finally answered that prayer and you've given me Victory you've given me healing whatever it is if he's done something praise him that's the best way to start but otherwise just say Lord I'm looking to you I'm trusting in you and I want to be where you are amen give our minds to him set the distractions aside listen this is what it's going to look at the end Revelation 21:23 says and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof doesn't say there's no sun moon or Stars it says it doesn't need it cuz there's a light that's there but you notice it says the glory of God did lighten it remember read the scripture the other day that said that the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee that's you that's me we're there and he's there that's what it looks like church if we don't like the light here we're not going to like the light there I like what brother Braham say he says if you think if you don't like it getting loud in a church service here you're not going to like heaven cuz it's a really loud place there's a lot of worship and praise going on in heaven guess what there's a lot of light there's a lot of Glory in heaven church we might as well get used to it down here cuz that's where we're meant to dwell amen that's what're supposed to be one more quote said then God told Moses and Aaron go make a great golden pot and fill it full of mana and put it in the holiest of holy places by the ark this Mana was to be set by the ark and there it never failed it never got old it never lost its sweetness it was always good inside there he says did you ever meet a person that's been in there and has tasted and living on this Mana you can meet him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday or Sunday a cloudy day a bright day a gloomy day things going right going wrong he is always sweet always full of love never to talk or do anything wrong he is living under the glory of God why the glory of the Lord has risen upon him he never gets hungry he never has to go to church to get built up he is just always full of God Amen if the musicians would come let's stand together if we would he is just always full of God how many would say this evening that's my desire amen I want to always be full of God Amen I want to be in a place where I don't feel the need to defend myself where I can react in love every time where I can be at peace no matter what's happening you say it's not possible brother John the only thing that makes it impossible is whether I decide I want to be there or not cuz God has made a place of rest available to each and every one of us amen I know there's a place to go but I've got a fight to get there here's the thing he's called me to be there he's told me there's a place of rest there's a place of Joy there's a place of love all of these things so it's up to me if I'm going to say Lord I want to be there or just settle for staying where Humanity keeps us every day amen we have so many blessings we're blessed we're blessed with the roof over our head with the cars we drive the jobs we have the in the bank we have but the greatest blessing we have is that we can come into the presence of God every single day the scepter is always out to us like Esther he's never unhappy to see us he's always wanting to spend time with his children Amen brother Brown would say why are people so tossed about we feel un tossed about worried stressed tired out sick of being sick there's a place where you can go and there the presence of God takes care of everything amen I said it earlier it's not complicated but it's a challenge what does he say you want to get close to God you want to come into His presence you got to think on God you got to worship God you've got to dwell on God and the things of God and separate yourself from the world it's a challenge but it's not complicated Amen brother Braham said when you think on him when you talk about him he comes around amen let's think about him let's talk about him let's dwell on him amen it's a simple thing but it's a battle every day to get in this in his presence amen but that'll take care of the situation it won't take the situation away every time but it'll take care of the situation because it'll take care of you it'll let you know that you can rest even when the storm's there you know I I wanted to bring a quote but it was so long not for this service it was more for the last service where brother Brandon would talk about when the disciples were in the in the in the the boat remember and Jesus said I'm going to go up on the mountain to pray you guys cross over and I'll meet you over there he said now he went up on the mountain he says and they went on there and as soon as they went out and they're in the middle of the of the of the ocean there the the lake or whatever the storm comes up he says where was Christ he said he was on that mountain watching them the entire time he knew what was going on he knew their fears he knew their problems he knew their situation he knew how low the the boat was getting in the water he knew how much time they had left before that thing sank and when the time was right he walked on the water to come and save them from it all he was watching the entire time if only they'd have called instead of cried if they'd have confessed their faith rather than worried their way through the situation amen he's always watching he's always available he's always ready to come to our help amen he's just asking us to come to Him scripture says drawn near to him and he'll draw near to you call on the name of the Lord and you'll be saved it's all we have to do dwell on him and he starts to come around amen let's Close Our Eyes Lord Jesus Lord if there's one thing Satan's good at these days it's distracting us trying to get our Eyes Off Of You Lord trying to get our eyes off of the word promises you've given us Lord trying to get us away from recognizing who and what we are but Lord your Prophet came and he said when you realize who you are the Rapture is going to go when you realize who you are then Satan can't stay on your property he can't stay in your house he can't stay in your life and Lord I believe we need to recognize more than ever who we are who you say we are Lord who you made us who you've called us to be who you've for ordained us to be heavenly father and Lord we can only get there if we dwell on the things of God lord if we can lay aside every little sin and everything that easily besets us Lord if we can lay down our phones if we can put aside our distractions Lord if we can just say Lord I'm here and I'm here to talk to you Lord I'm here to dwell on the good things of God Lord I'm here to present my situation to you Lord and not get ourselves distracted by the quote unquote reality of the situation Lord but to look to the promise of the word Lord that you'll never leave us you'll never forsake us Lord that you do all things well Lord and that everything that's in our lives will work for our good good if we'll walk according to your word Lord draw us into your presence I pray Lord you see the desires of our hearts Lord you see the sincere desires of our hearts Lord I believe everyone here wants to be closer to you Lord I believe every one of us needs to be closer to you Lord I'm raising my hand this evening Lord I'm saying make us closer to you draw us closer to you Lord let us step away from everything that holds us back Lord let us lay down everything Lord let us just step into your presence Lord press through the veil Lord God lord not be satisfied with where we're at Lord but to trust that as you've called us Lord you'll meet us in the place that you've called us to be Lord grant it to your people we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray Amen in your presence do we know that song do we know the verses as well 1057 [Music] I want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me and where my feet are on the Rock I want to hide where the the cares of this world cannot
