heads Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful that your word says where two or three are gathered in Your Name Lord there you would be in the midst Lord we've got more than that here Lord we've got a few in each house and Lord we're asking for your presence to not just be here in this building Lord but we're praying that your Holy Spirit would just activate within each home Heavenly Father Lord that it would reach down into lives and hearts Lord from The Young to the old Lord that you would just minister to hearts and souls tonight heavenly father have your way as your word Goes Forth Lord Jesus may you just find a resting place in the hearts that need it Lord may we may we just be encouraged strengthened Lord for battle tonight we pray Lord just minister to each one now we ask Lord we need your grace every day in your name we ask and pray it amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it amen certainly want to greet each one that's gathered in their homes today certainly wish we were all here I told Brother Gerald this week I said I'm already sick of this so but you know it is what it is and we've got to make the best of it amen I'm glad that we can still gather here and and preach it's I'd certainly rather preach here than from behind a table in my home or something with nobody there or just my family staring at me so thankful to be here regardless and have a song service and worship and just feel the presence of the Lord amen we're going to continue uh this evening finish up the battle for the gate in the series on the Royal seed and if you'll turn in your scriptures to Galatians 2:20 2:20 hopefully uh I spoke to brother Matt before the service so he's going to try and put up the scriptures and the quotes as I go through so that you have a chance to read uh along as I'm as I'm saying things since I tend to move pretty quickly amen God bless you Galatians 2:20 we read this last service says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen everything that we do everything that the Christian does that's according to the word of God that meets the standard of the word of God is done by faith and what Christ has done for us and what he is doing through US day by day amen one more scripture if we can and I'll just put it up on the screen here it's First Corinthians 5:7 says for we walk by faith not by sight amen you can have your seats amen Grace to each one tonight as we Minister we're going to continue like I said with the Royal seed and uh the battle for the gate part three and last time we talked so much about how the mind is the battlefield and how Satan has claimed the mind and God claimed the soul and once you're locked in in the soul then the battle's over for that but now the battle switches to the Mind amen we spent a lot of time the last time talking about how the the human being is built and it's got the three levels the body the spirit and the soul and then we put the mind in between the soul and the spirit and said the mind is what was guarding the access to the soul because the mind is what makes the choice and you've got to make a free will choice and when you make the Free Will Choice then the Soul is sealed with the Holy Spirit and now that can no longer be changed it can no longer be moved it can no longer be taken in and out of of eternal life but it's sealed until the day of our Redemption amen and once that soul is sealed now then we start to change and and we have all these different Gates here and that and what became self-will at the beginning now switches to a sealed soul and from out of there pushes the will of God and the word of God and faith and doubt now are moved aside and it's only faith that resides in there then starts to work its way back up through those channels and starts to bring them subject to the word of God Amen but when we seal are sealed in the soul then we give up our rights we give up our our our position in this world we give up the things that we would desire of ourselves and it becomes solely and completely in the control of Christ amen the Holy Spirit working in us to do of his will not of our own will amen and we talked about last time about the free moral agency I'm just going to do a a quick recap here so that we're we're up to speed before we move on what we remember how Satan and God are both battling for Authority in our body and when the soul is sealed then that's great but we know the battle as it shifts now to the Mind becomes all the more sharper because this mind is now subject to so many things it's subject to imagination it's subject to conscience and memory and reason and affection and these things it's subject to what it can see what it can smell feel hear and all these different things so the mind is being fed by subconscious things and by conscious things and Satan can maneuver those and push them all over the place and bring these things into your your your remembrance and into your mind and so he's fighting there to keep Faith suppressed he's fighting there to push the word back amen but once that soul is sealed amen once that that soul is sealed then we've got a finish work done inside of us brother brandham says and I'm going to again these are just a couple things I read before but he said see it's the inside no matter how good you are how moral you are how truthful you are these things are respected but Jesus said except a man be born again see there's got to be something happen inside now watch what he says here he says if you don't that's an artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to put to do it anyway he says it can't be artificial it's got to be real that's a great danger especially with somebody that's raised in a church family that's raised with a Christian family or professing Christian family is they start to act like Christ rather than have Christ within them brother Bram says you can't do that you've got to move this into the inside then he says there's only one Avenue that that that can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency to come into the Soul by your thoughts as a man think it in his heart so is he and if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said he says you get it there you are see there's the Battleground if you only get that started first he says don't start to try to move mountains until you've sealed that Soul off first until you've settled the the the Eternal life's question forever don't go around trying to do the other thing why because we know that in the last days they're going to come to him and when the Judgment comes and they'll say Lord Lord we did this in your name and that in your name and we did great Miracles and we healed the sick and we cast out demons and all these things and he says get away from me you workers of iniquity because I never never knew you there was no intimate relationship there was no one-on-one time but rather you were going around doing things that built up your kingdom even though it was through my power but you didn't do it according to the will and purpose of God why because your soul was never sealed by the Holy Spirit you took a gift you took a promise in the word you took a principle in the word and you said that's for me and I can use that you built a man a a kingdom for men amen so the starting part for the victory in the battle of the mind is victory in the soul amen you've got to settle that same question forever you've got take him in and let him set up a a headquarters right a a place of authority within you and then from there he's got something to work with to bring now the other 10 Senses Into uh subjection amen but we're looking at what we're looking at that new birth and sometimes that puts pressure on us or sometimes we start putting pressure on other people because we know that they can be in there and we look at our kids and they're acting right and we know they're doing the right things and they're in obedience to their parents but we know that they maybe haven't come to a new birth yet and we start to put this pressure on ourselves or we start to put pressure on them to become a child of God Amen but you can't pressure somebody into becoming a child of God it's got to be something else that happens and brother brandham talks about this and this is all within the greatest battle ever fought mind you okay this is not from some other sermon this is him preaching from greatest battle ever fought he throws Us in for a reason because what he doesn't want is stillborn children amen he doesn't want false births amen he says we're so anxious to see things done we're so anxious to do something for God he says this little lady no doubt is anxious to live he's talking to a lady there that's that's there for healing she wants to be well others are here that wants to be well and when we hear about that case like the doctor the resurrection of the Dead the Great Mighty things that are God has done then we're anxious and the thing of it is we try to reach through these senses to grab a hold of something here like conscience so many people lots of times has misconstrued the word and I've been misunderstood by this by making altar calls I say I wasn't n much on an altar call not meaning that you shouldn't make an altar call brother Brandon wasn't big on having people come up to the altar because there's a danger there and he gets into it he says but somebody gets Somebody by the arm and say oh brother John you know what me and you have been neighbors all this time come up here at the altar get down what's he doing he says I wish I had a Blackboard here I could show you what he's doing he's trying to work through his soul on affections he's saying you and I we have a relationship we have a connection we have an understanding here let me bring bring you up to the Altar and he says that don't work he says that's not the Avenue certainly it isn't maybe he's working on what a memory through the sense of his soul Oh Brother John you had a wonderful mother she died a long time ago a memory see you can't do that maybe the mother was a Christian oh your mother would really love it if you if she knew that you were coming to Christ today let's go do it he's saying you can't do that that's a pressure you're putting on them but it's not the right kind of pressure he says it's got to come down the line of free moral agency you your yourself let the word of God you don't come because your mother was a good woman you don't come because you're a good neighbor you come because that God calls you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word that word is what means everything that word if you can get everything out of the way all conscience all senses and just let the word come in that word will produce just exactly amen you can't come through by somebody else you've got to come to Christ through Christ which is the word amen and any other way is going to lead to downfall later on you'll stand for a while and then the true colors will shine through and all of a sudden there'll be a falling away amen you didn't truly come to Christ amen like I said we can we can play on our children's emotions and we can talk about how proud we'd be if they came to the Lord in these different things and we have to be very careful with that because we'll end up calling them to Christ when Christ himself hasn't perhaps made that move in their soul what do we do we encourage them by what speaking the word living the word bringing the word to their remembrance being an example to them so that they know what God looks like with skin on it but God himself still has to call them and speak to them amen otherwise we're going to get stillborn children now just cuz somebody came to the Lord a long time ago and then went out that doesn't mean they didn't have a new birth that just means they're backslid potentially amen we don't want to put that pressure on ourselves and say oh well maybe I put pressure on them and that's why they came to the Lord and then they're not serving today no no no that's between them and God Amen we live the word we bring the word up we raise them in the ab of the Lord and then it's up to the Lord to call him amen amen amen but like we said before once you've accepted Christ once he's in the Soul by the Holy Spirit then we're sealed to the day of our Redemption and now the battle shifts purely to the mind and the mind is what we're going to focus on of course tonight because that's what we've been talking on and that's where the battle is brother brandham says and once the Holy Spirit comes in we're we should see results right if somebody's got the Holy Spirit and their life is exactly the way it was before they got baptized and received the Holy Ghost something's wrong amen something hasn't happened there according to the word because every time you look in the word it had an effect on those people amen they came into a group and they started acting the same way not exactly the same way as the one next to them but they had common traits amen the world started slipping further and further away the influence of the Believers What mattered more amen they came under the hearing and the preaching of the word they submitted themselves to the authority of the word and then their lives started to change amen so there's always going to be an effect in Romans 12 this is Paul speaking says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable under God which is your reasonable service am me he's talking about sanctification there he's saying set aside the things that are going to cause dirt and filth on your body this the stains of sin and these things he says set your body aside don't use it for evil things whether it's the sensual side or whether it's for financial gain and you put the focus on those things whether you're eating the wrong sorts of food if you don't exercise all of this fits into this it's all a part of sanctification it's making yourself fit for purpose and that can be through Health right that it's okay to talk about health behind a Pulpit because if you're sick all the time and you have poor sleeping habits and poor eating habits and these things guess what you're going to be useless for God because you're going to be sick all the time so you got to take care of your body but there's other things that come with it again how do you fill your time what are your eyes looking at on a regular basis what are you reading what are you listening to who are you hanging out with in these things it's all a part of presenting your body a Living Sacrifice but verse two watch where Paul goes now he says now when the body is taken care of he says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen so it's not just present your body Living Sacrifice but he says now there has to be a renewing of your mind it has to be transformed your whole being's going to be transformed by what the renewing of your mind now he doesn't say newing he says renewing it's bringing you back to something that you were you were in before it's bringing you back to the mind of Christ bringing you back into the mind of Christ we could even say that you have before the foundation of the world he says we got to bring that now back now that everything else is taken care of let's bring that out and let's start working on the rest of your system here Amen brother Paul had mentioned this in this closing prayer last time and I thought it was was very fitting as as a way to kind of Kick this off this evening amen so after the Soul's been sealed what's next is the transforming of everything else by the renewing of your mind cuz remember when we drew the picture here we have the soul but we have the Mind marked in here I can draw it real quick and then we have the mind in here and that's controlling what's going in and out right the soul sealed so nothing else can come in but it's now controlling what moves out and brother Bron will'll talk about that a a little bit later but now we've got to transform this because this is the gateway to this and the gateway to this and then this has been sealed this has been changed this has been locked in this is all Christ and the soul but now the mind is the Gateway here and he says You' got to do something with that mind you've got to there's got to be a renewing of that mind so that you can come into the fullness of Christ Amen brother Braham says this in the power of transformation he says now that now that we have been saved so saved means what doesn't mean that you've gone down to the Altar and and cried and then got baptized saved is when you get the Holy Ghost right we're talking to Believers now salvation is when you get the Holy Ghost he says now so if we could say now that we've been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have so he's covered it all here whichever way you want to look at it he says now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from what that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word what did Paul say that ye may be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and accept cable and perfect will of God brother BR saying the exact same thing here so he says you have to be what transformed from the Natural Things of life so what is it that drives the Natural Things of life in our in our in our lives it's the senses right it's the 10 inner senses and the 10 outer senses that's how the whole natural world is living today they're living by those 10 senses and that's what drives everything nobody's moving by Supernatural power the way we are is in they're consciously feeding on the supernatural they're looking to the supernatural they're expecting the supernatural they're expecting to manifest the Supernatural they're not doing that they're just going by what I put in is what I get out what I put in is what I get out what I've done what I've learned the school I've been to the job experience I have the marital relationships I have d d d and they're putting that all together and they're coming up with a natural way of life and occasionally they'll learn from somebody else's mistake and do a better thing but usually they won't they'll just follow their own way of going right but their mind has shifted from some semblance of good manners and general citizenship to one of selfishness today that's where we're at now is total selfishness right everybody's looking out for themselves and nobody's looking on the things of the other when we go back to the beginning this is before the flood in Genesis and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually every imagination of the thoughts of his Hearts was only evil continually amen all the time all they could think about was evil that's before the first judgment okay we're coming right up to the borders of the second judgment now and watch watch what Paul says in Timothy he says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come the last days are today amen so if he says in the last days perilous times will come that means perilous times are when now right the perilous times are here but what kind watch what kind of peril comes because too many people think that the Peril is in the type of people that's going to be described here but it's not right we look at the bad traits here and we say that's the Peril that's here but I want you to see something because this is only a symptom verse two says for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God now that sounds like some pretty bad people but let we get to verse 5 and it says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now remember we're talking about perilous times but he's talking about perilous people but he says perilous times not perilous people so I want you to pay close attention to verse 5 here because if you're listening to the service that we listen to recently what did it brother BR say about the people that were described in those verses because we look there and we if we look through verses 2 through 4 we'd say that's the world but then we read verse 5 and we realize that can't be the world because it says having a form of godliness the world has no form of godliness God hasn't even entered in the equation he's not in their mind he's not in their thoughts he's not in their actions they have no comprehension of God but there's a people that has a comprehension of God but they're still fitting the descriptions of 2 through four so who is it on Wednesday night the tape that brother Gerald played it talked about this and what did it say it said that these are religious people right what is it they are people that have a form of godliness they have enough of God to go to church and listen but when they leave there they have no power to live the life that they're hearing about or maybe not hearing about these days with the way the churches are going amen but they have enough godliness to go to church and that's about it they can't live the life and so they have all of these other things lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters without natural affection truth Breakers traitors heady high-minded this is Christians professing Christians that they're talking about here he says this is the Peril that's here and what is it it's a religious spirit that is focused on selfishness and good living amen it's the leoan church here this is the leosan church that Paul's describing right here right what is it and he says you're what you're poor miserable blind wretched naked and you don't even know it right because why they think they're in a for they think they have God they think they're they're truly Christians and they're not because they have no power in their lives Amen brother Braham says this in looking to the Unseen now he's praying here he says and I know there's so much unbelief in the world you said in the last days they'd rise there'd rise scoffers behead high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good even hated and they would be a religious group having a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof from such turn away said that the spirit spoke that expressing that in the last days these signs would be so how did they get there there religious group but how did they get there they turn down the word of God you go all the way back to the first church Age and what happened was they kicked the Holy Spirit out and they took on what the leadership and thoughts of men and every time what does that lead to it leads to separation from God which is death amen and that's how they got there is that they turned down the truth they turned down the very life of God and they paid a price and this is it this is where they've gotten is second Timothy brother Brown's pointing to First Timothy he says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils seducing Spirits is what ones that tell you what the flesh wants rather than what the word or the spirit would want in your life amen a seducing spirit is one that appeals to the flesh rather than to the word so he says you've given into you've given heed to seducing Spirits listening to things that give you what you want as opposed to what the word has for you and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy you know what does that mean says you're saying one thing and you're doing another right saying one thing and doing another having their conscience seared with a hot iron what is it they get to the point where they've so allowed the devil to wrap up their mind with great ideas and campaigns and how to monetize this and how to take advantage of that and how we can build this great Kingdom for God and in the end what does it lead to it leads to wealth and then from there what happens is God is just he's completely moved out right it's popularity in women it was a shame this week Ravi Zacharias I don't know if you know him right wonderful man great apologist for for for the word he he had a great mind for answering people in the way that they think and it came out this week that he'd had a bunch of relationships with women in the background and abusive relationships and and taking advantage of people and things like that why because they don't have God that's the unfortunate truth is that they have a form and they've St well and I say God blessed the man for what he did that was good but yet there was a failing there why because he wasn't sealed in he didn't have the full truth someplace he turned it down and so what happened was God couldn't guard those things out what is it Satan could come in through those channels because he wasn't locked down and all of a sudden he's using the word to now put these people into a a state of depression and telling them you can't do this because it'll undo all the good work I've done and all these things and now he's using the word and his ministry as something to hold people back as opposed to free their lives amen it's horrible horrible why because they've gone the way of Cain amen they've gone the way of K and these ones that they said doesn't God speak to us doesn't God do these things and isn't my sacrifice as good or better or be more beautiful and they just end up in death every single time and disappointment and now you have this coming out and it destroys most of his ministry people say he helped me so much and then they find the man falls and they don't know what to do with it right it's a shame amen God help us what is it they get to the place where they're conscious is sear with the hot iron the spirit of God and the word of God can have no effect and if you know anything about animals what do they do to mark them they brand them right they put a brand in the hot coals of a fire until it's glowing hot then they come down and they sear that hide and they put a permanent mark on that animal and it doesn't hurt for long why because they sear all the nerves there and they actually can't feel anything it only hurts for a split second and then there's no pain because they burned it or when somebody's wounded and there's blood coming out in these things and what was the emergency procedure for that they cauterize a wound right they take something that was very hot and they just and it closes the ends of all the blood vessels and it keeps the and it just stops the bleeding from happening but what happens is from now on in that place they can't have any more they can't feel anything there's no nerves there anymore it's permanently damaged but it stopped the bleeding and it saves their lives amen he's saying the same thing with their mind he says your conscience has been seared with a hot iron it's been applied to it and now it doesn't actually work anymore it's there but it has no effect on you amen it's been seared it's it's all the nerves all the conscience all the ability of the conscience to work has been destroyed amen but why why doesn't that work for us why aren't we covered by this why aren't we why aren't we the ones that are are speaking lies and hypocrisy why it's because we've accepted the truth it's because we've opened up to the truth because when we opened up to do what he told us to do and he comes into our lives then now that seals it forever amen and though the devil can play with our minds he can play with our emotions and he can play with our bodies in these different things he can't get into the route amen he can't get into the basement there he can't get into the place of of security the place where the the control is and so we can never get to this place he can literally take our our sanity and we would still go to heaven because our souls are sealed amen he can drive you to a place and how many times did Brother Bram deal with people that were almost gone insane from nervousness right women going through the change of life in these different things and it just got into their mind and they get so frustrated and so worked up about do I have the Holy Ghost different things he said and they'd almost go crazy Satan's still working there and H almost all the time brother Brian would say yes sister yes brother you have the Holy Ghost you have the Holy Ghost and they would just settle them down and all of a sudden that thing would go away but God the Satan could never get in all the way he could never turn them they'd still stay and they'd still keep coming even though it was driving them crazy do I have this do I not have this but Satan couldn't get in there and take them all the way down amen why because it was sealed and he can't have dominion there right there's only one has dominion and when the Holy Spirit comes in nothing else ever gets get in there anymore amen we talked about this last time what happens 2 Corinthians 10:5 says casting down imaginations this is what the believer does right our conscience isn't affected this way we don't have access Satan doesn't have access to us why because we're we're obeying the scripture that says casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ brother Bram talked about thoughts he said you don't originate all your thoughts he says you've got you've got the word you've got God on one side and you've got Satan and they're like birds flying overhead and they're dropping things in he says and the only thing he says you can't stop the birds from flying overhead but you can stop them from building a nest right so Satan's going to be constantly dropping thoughts and ideas and feelings and memories into your life all the time and God's trying to bring up Faith in the word and Satan's trying to bring up doubt right and bad feelings and bad thoughts and all these different things he says' and you get to choose which one stays but they're going to keep dropping no matter what getting the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that your thoughts are always going to be good that's what Paul says here he says bring into captivity every thought he's not blaming you for the thoughts but he's saying it's up to you to bring into captivity the ones that don't align with the word amen and what does he say he says casting down imaginations amen bringing them from a place of regard a place of consideration a place of acceptance and putting them under your feet so he's saying cast them down take them from a high place and put them down into a low place for me it kind of reminds me of a tower you know when the old in the medieval days they'd always build a big strong tower and they'd have only one way in there and it would be completely fortified up and you couldn't do anything to get in then they'd stand up at the top and nobody could get in but if they could get a battering ram up there somehow and theyd knock down one corner of the walls there then that whole thing would come tumbling down right they cast down that entire Tower by knocking it out from the base if they could get at it amen he's talking about what bringing your mind into a higher plane brother Brandon puts a really a really neat way talking about he says what does it mean to to cast down imaginations he says now somebody will say just a minute brother isn't it reasonable that we he says this is beyond reasoning what we're talking about here he says it's an outer space outer space of reasoning we're supposed to cast them down he says so when you go above them they are cast down now he doesn't say pull them down he says go above them he says that's when they're cast down is when you go above what they're talking about when you're going above the experience above the thought above the memory he says when you go above that that's when they're cast down he says that's how you put them under your feet he says you don't pull them down you go over them you go above them you take them to a higher place he says cuz they're under you outer space the astronaut raised up above all human imaginations he says you're in the Glorious presence of Christ and Christ is in you what's he saying go up above them get into the presence of Christ get into the place of the word get into the promises of God and every single one of things those things will go below you amen what's brother Gerald said so many times we are now in Heavenly places he said what is that that's the full revealing of the word that's where we want to be is where that word is taking the preeminence and it's bringing us above all of this sinful flesh and the problems that we have in our lives and bringing us to the place of promise and Faith Amen brother bam starts talking now back in the greatest battle ever fought he's talking about what it means to cast these things down in the battle in the mind he says now remember it's not Christian Science Now Mind Over Matter he's not saying think good thoughts and then that's how you're going to overcome because that's what we tend to think sometimes as we say well just keep your mind positive and that's a good thing better to be positive than negative but he says you can't start with the mind you got to start with the soul and then something else happens he says the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there brings the life he says just your thought doesn't do it so if you're dwelling here in the mind he says that's never going to do it he says you got to start in the soul he says and then the Soul brings it to the mind and the mind says yes or no to it he says it accepts it and then when the mind accepts it he says it's brought in the channel of your thought see it's not the thought as Christian Science make it Mind Over Matter that's not it why because life doesn't originate in the mind life originates in the soul so he says if you're trying to bring life to any of these situations to any of these areas it's got to start here it can't start in the mind can never be in the mind he says he can continues he says but your mind accepts it it grasps it what is your mind controlled by your soul and your soul catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you he's talking about life into you there and then it brings life into the rest of you he says oh brother when that takes place when life comes down that channel from the soul to the mind and into the rest of the body then into you then the word of God is manifested in you very simple but what's the problem you got this stinking mind here where Satan has free reign right and he's running around there trying to stop the flow from of life from there to there to there right he says if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you ask what you will and it'll be done for you now watch the progression here we read read this last time I believe but I want to you want this to catch he says then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul from There Goes Forth feeding every channel he says the trouble is we're standing in here in the mind says we're standing in here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out here the preacher preaching right the word going forth he says we're standing in the mind trying to accept the word out here okay he says you got to stop that he says and come down that Channel with the true word of God and then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts as the inside he says you can't stand here here and accept the word here he says the word has to be here to come out it's got to be in to come out it can't go out to come in to go out that's what we're trying to do is we're saying everything I need is out here let me bring it in through my mind and I'll accept it here and then it'll go there he says no you got to get it into the soul here and push it out through the mind he says don't treat it as something outside of you it's got to be something that's inside of you the word has to be inside of you and when you have the word which is God himself then you have everything you're ever going to need as we've talked about many times amen amen I put it on the slide here we look at it and it's like we've got healing Deliverance change peace Joy love all these things that we're looking for and we've got them all outside the body and so a special Ministry comes in and we say that's great now I'm going to get what I need and he's saying that's not it he says you're treating that as something that's outside of you he says but if you'll treat it now like it's inside of the Soul if you're sealed with the Holy Spirit this is something now that's going to be in you already you already have it this is not something to be attained to this is something you already have attained it's inside you by the Holy Spirit and all you've got to do is pass it through this mind and get it to accept it he says and it'll flow through everything else in your body that you have need them he says don't look out for it you got to look inward for it get it settled inside and then the outside's going to push it's going to push all the way out through the mind out through the spirit and out through the body and it'll meet every need that you ever have amen amen the fai's got to be on the outside it's not on the in it's got to be on the inside it can't start on the outside amen why the mind's going to make that choice but it's got to be a choice has already been made is really what we're talking about you made a choice in the soul and that's what's going to drive the choices for everything else settle the soul and everything else will be there I remember we had a a men's meeting one time at a particular church and a brother said you know we talk about these issues we have and this and that the other thing he says and everybody says get the Holy Ghost he says but that's you know that's just two pad of an answer we need something more than that what do you do with somebody that says that doesn't realize that the Holy Ghost inside of you is the answer I mean that is literally acts 238 what what are we supposed to do to be saved this is it and then after that we see men that failed all time and time again Peter the classic example after that Peter doesn't fail he makes errors right he has to be corrected on Doctrine these different things but Peter himself never walks back from the word again he never walks back from the gospel he never walks back from the testimony of Jesus Christ what is the Holy Ghost is the answer you have to get the Holy Ghost and this brother said that's what everybody says but that's like give us more when youve got the Holy Ghost you have everything of God in you what more could he give you that's right so brother Braham says he gave you the best thing he could give you which was the Holy Ghost that's all you need and then yes you need teaching we've got a five full ministry you need an active body you need a a well-built you know Church body that's feeding the needs of the people and that this all goes together that's what God uses but without the Holy Ghost you're not getting anywhere in the word yeah as in in the manifestation of the word the healing of the word the Deliverance of the word the fruits of the spirit all these things you can't get that outside of the Holy Ghost blew my mind when he said that brother Bram now he takes us back this is in in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but he takes you back to your original purpose here he says and man was made to be a God we know that Genesis 1:26 he had dominion over the whole earth and he was made to be an amateur God and now when he receives God he becomes a Son of God again that's where we are today you're a Son of God again you're a daughter of God again today if you have the Holy Ghost you are a son or a daughter of God he was made in the image of God God had hands God had feet and so therefore a man was made like him so he's an amateur God but sin has blinded every fiber in his body in his mind in his heart he says now don't ever try to study it out you can't figure it out amen he says in the Garden of Eden Satan chose his part of the man his head his intellectuals God took his heart the intellectuals will reason why well I'm this way and I'm that way you'll never get anywhere with God there but your heart your faith now look what he's talking about the origin now your heart your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows intellectually nothing about let me read that again your heart your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about he says You cast down reasoning see you must be positive and you stay there until you are positive then when you're positive nothing can turn you he's not talking about a positive attitude he's saying you stay here until you're positive that your soul is sealed to the day of your Redemption make your calling and election sure make sure that you have the Holy Ghost Inside and when you are positive that you have that he says then nothing can turn you because that's the only thing that will keep you from turning is the Holy Ghost amen that's not me trying to interpret that he says when you're positive then there's nothing can turn you there's only one thing in the scripture that allows you to never be turned again and that's the Holy Ghost so he says get there when you've got the Holy Ghost then you stay there till you're positive and nothing can turn you you are then a son you are a daughter of God being manifested you always were amen we've covered this before you always were a son you always were a daughter but now it's manifestation time it's adoption time it's stepping into the role and the plan and purpose of God for you and then from there you're going to start moving into what he has for you amen amen let's put this in the word of God we talked a lot of quotes here but let's take it back to the scriptures amen John 9 this is taking everything we've talked about and putting it now into a story in the scripture amen so listen closely John 9 And1 says as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth think about that man now he's been blind from his birth and he has no idea why I'm sure he's had lots of stories and people have told him this that and the other thing but Jesus comes here for a very specific purpose and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or or his parents that he was born blind see back then they thought that if something bad was in your life it was because you did bad or your parents did bad cuz it talked about the sins of the father going down all the way to the fourth generation generation these different things and and so they always felt that if there was if you were poor if you had a a limitation in your body if you were dumb if you were ugly whatever it was it was because somebody had sinned in your family or you sinned okay now he's he was born from birth blind so I don't know how he sinned right anyways Jesus answered and said neither had this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world now let's stop there for a second because mentally intellectually if we're the blind man what's going through our head now cuz we've had these questions all our life why am I blind poor me why do I have to do this I sit here I beg every day woe is me my life is horrible and now some man comes along and right in front of you they have a conversation about you and they say this guy how come he's blind is it because he was bad or his parents Jesus says no no no this has nothing to do with him this has to do with me and so that I can show The Works of my father he says this is for the works of God to be made manifest in him this is you literally have this problem so that God can manifest himself in you he's gone through his entire life with this problem and it is purely so that he can be healed and God can show a work and show that he's doing something through Christ in that day amen that's the only reason he's blind has nothing to do with him has everything to do with the manifestation of the works of God in him verse six says when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he Anointed The Eyes Of The Blind Men with the clay now I want you to think about this for a second it's kind of funny you're standing there you can't see and you hear somebody go okay and then you maybe hear I'm rubbing down in the dirt and then something touches your face and you realize that this man has just spit in the ground made mud and put it on your eyes what do you do what's going through your mind are you ping trying to get it away or has something else happened that allows you to allow him to keep going amen Jesus said sorry I didn't click Jesus said unto him go wash in the pool of salom which is by interpretation sent now what are you going to do when he says this this man's walked up said that you're not you didn't do anything bad your parents didn't do anything bad you're there to manifest The Works of God and then he spits in the ground makes mud rubs it on your face and then doesn't does tell you to go into the house that's behind you and clean up he says no you got to go all the way to the pool of salom now and and clean up there who would do it you'd be an idiot to do it if you're thinking with the natural mind right if something else hasn't dropped in there amen but listen to what brother brandham says he says when he had the blind man his parents talked to him he was spitting on the ground while talking to the man and the words that he was saying over his lips and the saliva in his mouth spitting on the ground he says do you accept spitting on the ground this is covid-19 today right when there and when he spit a great big puddle of spit on the ground picked it up in his hands the M had made a cake and put it over the Man's eyes and told him to go wash in the pool of salom what would the health rule say about that today I think we know what they would say amen that's ass salt right now listen we're going to continue it says go wash in the pool of salom and he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing now watch what brother Braham says but Jesus spit and the man obeyed what he told him to do and he came back receiving his sight and they marveled listen to this not because of the spit not because of the mud but because he believed what Jesus told him was the truth is that right he says now that's what you've got to believe today believe it with all your heart he says they didn't Marvel because of what Jesus did they marveled that the man believed and obeyed in the first place Hallelujah that is the place of the believer right there built to manifest The Works of God and you'll obey the silliness of what everybody else says makes no sense amen amen this man is there so that God could show a reality in that day a testimony of the power and working of God through Christ amen what ought that to do to us today amen how many things do we have in our lives genetically right emotionally relationally financially healthwise whatever it is how many of us have something that we've dealt with all of our lives and if we look at this scripture and we know that everything is under our foot then what out that to tell us that it's there for if only to do what manifest The Works of God in our life if we were perfect creatures where would the power of God be in our lives amen but when we're dealing with these things when we're facing these things then what is it it's something that God can show himself real in our life to us and to others that are looking on our lives amen and they won't see that anywhere else they won't see that anywhere else we are the ones that they're looking at we are the Epistles seen and read of all men and so when they see that one day Jonathan was this way and then the next day he was this way whether it's fi whether it's his health whether it's a mannerism whether it's a an issue he has with certain people whatever it may be they see one day he's this way and then the next he's that and they say what happened God took it away from me God healed me here's my testimony of what God's done in my life amen what is it he's come and he's put those things in our lives so that he can manifest The Works of God even today amen look at what the neighbors said the neighbors therefore and they which had seen him that he was blind and said is this not he that sat and begged some said this is he others said he's like him but he said I am he therefore said he unto thee him how were thine eyes opened here's the answer he answered and said a man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me go to the pool of salom and wash and I went and washed and I received sight very matter of fact there isn't a big story he says a man told me to do something I went and did it and here I am it's that simple what a response he put mud on my eyes told me to go wash off in the pool of salom and I did it and I received my sight end of story nothing special to see here guys I didn't do anything crazy I just listened to him but remember the quote we said that brother Bram said he said they they marveled not because of what had been done to him but that he had obeyed that he had believed what Jesus had said amen what did Brother Ram say faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about something about that conversation that identified him that put him in the word that put him in the purpose and plan of God it took his faith and it started to rise up and all of a sudden he says this is somebody that I can take this is somebody I can believe this is somebody I can put Faith in there's more here than just a man there's something going on that I'm a part of and I'm going to take every advantage of it and I'm going to do what he says cuz what I've done before hasn't hasn't got me anywhere amen what a scripture amen I went and washed and I received sight it's no different today what do the scripture say if you need healing you can have it a couple different ways you can be like the Centurion where brother Bram talked about where you can just claim it by faith and it happens you can have the elders lay hand on you and anoint you amen if you got a demon on you if you got a problem in your life we can lay hands on you all these things we've got all sorts of methods here but it's up to you to say what am I going to take but you've got to take something and go with it amen you've got to stick with it you've got to say this is what he said to do so I'm doing it and I'm going to have what he said and it's just that simple that's what he's saying he told me what to do I did it and I got what he said I was going to get and the word is no different for us when we're looking at it what does he say to do I've done it I've met every requirement brother BR says if you meet the requirement he's obligated to do exactly what he did with the other person there's nothing can hold it back and the only variable there is time is he going to do it right now is he going to do it tomorrow is he going to do it next week or next year right like he said if you speak to the mountain say move he said it'll move but he didn't say when but it's still going to move and that's the only that's the trial of your faith is to wait until it happens but you hold there and say I did what he told me to do and now what's going to what he said would happen is going to happen amen that Faith what did it do it drop down in here and then it made his mind do what Jesus said because he had to make a choice remember that Faith had to override what he would naturally want to do if you've got mud all over your eyes and face you want to get it off quickly but it had to go now and say are you going to obey yes then it comes down to his legs and makes his legs move all the way to the pool of salom then it makes his arms bend down and go and clean it off of his face he had to bring his body into subjection he had to bring his Spirit into subjection for this to happen it wasn't just you know across the street he had to go to the pool of salom he had to do exactly what Jesus said he had to bring everything into subjection if you remember the end of this story it's incredible I mean a man has received a sight and they kicked him out of the synagogue because he said this man is of God he says Jesus is of God and his parents even after seeing their son healed would not say that Jesus was the one that did it or that this was a miracle why because they had said that anybody that says that Jesus was sent from God or whatever they'd be kicked out of the synagogue so the parents didn't want that they need their denomination amen so they said look he's a man he's of age go ask him and they went to him and he said look all I know is one day I was blind the next day I have my sight that's it he says and it's only we haven't seen this ever happen so he says it only comes from God this isn't of Satan so this man is of God and they kicked him out of the they kicked him out of the the synagogue says and Jesus heard that they cast him out and when he found him he said to him DST thou believe on the Son of God he answered and said unto him who is he Lord that I might believe on him and Jesus said unto him thou Hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee so up to that point this man just believes that Jesus is a man of God like a prophet perhaps you know and he said Lord I believe and he worshiped him the very same faith that got him to accept his his healing got him to recognize who it was that was standing right there in front of him amen this was a child of God through and through right and he didn't just get his healing he got salvation here and I'm sure he went all the way on and and became you know maybe he was in the upper room later for all we know but he says Lord I believe just like that boom he believed and he worships him he's kicked out of the synagogue he's never going back but he's got his sight spiritually he's got his sight physically now amen and Jesus said for judgment am I come into this world that they which see not might see and they which see might be made blind oh I love that he says that they which see not might see that they which are defeated might have victory that they which are weak might be strong that they which are sick might be well that they which are depressed might have joy that they which are lost might be found that they which have not would have so he's saying that's what I've come to the ones that have needs he says I'm here to meet it the ones that think they don't need it they don't get anything that was the Pharisees and the Sadducees each one right what is it he's coming to those that have a need not to those that declare they have everything Pharisees what did they always say they went back to pedigree and they went back to the law yeah right we are the sons of Abraham we are the children of Abraham and we do everything that the scriptures say right that's what they fell back on their works and their pedigree Jesus doesn't have anything to do with that amen that's not what we're looking to as our works and our ped agree so when we say what it's too big it's too tough It's too ingrained I've tried everything right the blind man I'm sure he tried all sorts of Remedies all sorts of healers right nothing doesn't matter past experience and the current condition have nothing to do with it then we're not looking to what we have we're not looking to what we are we're looking to the word that says that we would have what we have need of and that he can change us that he can heal us that he can deliver us that he can save us that he can fill us that he can strengthen each and every one of us amen amen Amen brother Bram starts to make a shift now and how he's talking he starts to focus on the five inner senses and the five outer senses but he really starts to focus more on the spirit side of things you know affection memory conscience and these different things reason and whatnot and he starts to call them channels and when I was doing a study he did a lot of he spoke a lot of of senses and then he called them Gates but now he starts moving to channels and it's kind of like the idea of uh you know a furn or a fireplace or something like that where you've got what you've got chimneys that come out and he says you got to keep those chimneys clear otherwise the fire can't exhaust right the smoke can't go out it starts to clog it down then the fire can't breathe Well it can't exhaust well and it just eventually goes out right so he says you know the chimney is supposed to be there to allow the fire to function properly but when it gets blocked up it doesn't he says and these senses are no different and here he says if you get them all blocked up with doubt and these different things then it's going to hinder the moving of of the holy spirit in your life and so you got to clear those out amen so they'll hold back or they'll resist your healing Deliverance Joy whatever it is you're looking for then they'll hold you back cuz they get clogged up with something and the problem is like we said is so often we're looking and people are coming in to church or they're coming to a service or they're coming to a Ministry and they're saying I have need of these things and they're treating it all as outside and the problem is they've got all these things clogged up inside and so when they're trying to push it in it's just pushing it deeper and deeper into their body it's not cleaning it out it's pushing it in and then eventually you just get it so packed down with things and I think sister Kimberly sent the the quote the other day about letting off the pressure and the problem is when it when it's out here and it's pushing in all it's doing is you got two things working on it's just packing it Tighter and Tighter and Tighter and something's going to give eventually right brother BR says you got to keep them clean and we'll get into that a little bit amen amen when people are coming in like this and they're looking at out outside it's always a what if and a maybe and a possibility as opposed to a certainty right and it's never going to work that way brother Bram says it must be accepted in the mind and then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up why because it's cleaned out it's scoured out there's nothing can come up in the memory and say well I remember Mrs Jones tried to trust God and miss so and so and Miss do tried to trust God for healing one time and she failed see but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit so we got to be careful because sometimes it's like scripture says you clean out the house but you don't fill it with anything else and then the the demon comes back with seven others stronger than himself right sometimes we the holy spirit does a work in our life and we clean out all these things but then he says you can't just clean it he says you got to fill it with something that's the Holy Spirit faith in the word in these different things he says you it's got to be cleared out and purged and then filled on the inside with the Holy Spirit then those things don't even come into memory no matter what missed Jones and what she did it's you and God together and nobody else but you two there you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how long you can make the war linger it stop it right now and the problem is like I said is you clean it out but you don't fill it with anything and so these things start to trickle back in and then Satan has another foothold again and now you're fighting the same battle over and over and over again he says if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything thinking about well I might fail it might not be right he says don't you do that at all you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me we all have tremendous faith for the other person don't we right have you ever noticed that when somebody else is going up for healing going up for deliverance going up for a need we've got tremendous Faith amen but he says you got to say that it's for me not your word is eternally true for Joe but your word is eternally true for Jonathan and that's the challenge for us is it's it's for me I'm under the banner of the word you can have the Holy Ghost and people still get these complexes where they say it's not for me it's for everybody else but it's not for me this is mine to bear it's mine to bear I'm going to have to deal with this all my life it's never going to be resolved da d da d da d da no he says your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I can't fail because I'm taking your word there's a battle that's the thing what's he saying throw everything aside push it out clean it out fill it with the word fill it with faith let the Holy Spirit flow through it and dwell on the promise not on the past not on somebody others somebody else's failures not on those that have lacked faith not those that have fallen by the wayside focus on the promis of the word amen so what's the secret how do you get to that place Philippians 4 says be careful for nothing that say almost seems like it means don't wor don't think about anything don't do anything but the amplifi says do not fret or have any anxiety about anything what it means is don't be worried about anything but in everything not in most things in some things but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God so this is how we approach God right with Thanksgiving for what he has done and what he will do always with Thanksgiving you go in with a thankful heart when we're having devotions at home you know at the end when we pray we always start with praise reports before we go into prayer requests right that's what you start with you start with Thanksgiving and you go in with a fa F heart you go in with an expectant heart and say Lord we're we're we're we're reminding you and we're thanking you for what you've done and Lord we're looking for the same thing to happen for these requests now amen go in with Thanksgiving and prayer and supplication you always start with the Thanksgiving he says and if you do this then the peace of God verse 7 which passees all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus so this is how you keep your mind he says is through prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving amen notice that last bit it says it will keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus it will keep it it will preserve it it will protect it it will hold it the Amplified says and God's peace which transcends all understanding shall Garrison and mount guard over your hearts and Minds in Christ Jesus shall Garrison and mount guard over your hearts what does it mean to Garrison when you have a Garrison what does it mean it means there's a bunch of soldiers in there it means there's an army inside there to hold what is in there right and that's what it's saying is that the God's peace is going to set up an army inside there and it's going to mount a guard over your heart and over your mind in Christ Jesus amen sorry then he says finally Brethren so you've done all that and when it mounts a Garrison when there's an army inside of you now that's guarding your mind what is it going to do verse 8 says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever Things Are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue that's strength so if there's any strength if there be any praise think on these things this is the Garrison in your mind this is a Holy Spirit Army in your mind now that's telling you what to dwell on and he says things that are true honest just pure lovely good report and it's going to give you what strength and praise think on these things that's what he's saying that's how you keep it that's how the Holy Spirit keeps is it keeps your mind on those things so if you're dealing with a situation if you're looking for something in the word of God if the promises of God are being Amplified then what do you do you're going to spend time in the word you're going to be reading your Bible you're going to be praying you're going to be singing songs you're going to be listening to songs you're going to be hanging around with Believers that have a like mind to you that are believing for healing Deliverance change all these different things you're going to be feeding that so that that's what's inside your mind all the time amen you're going to be thinking on the good things not on who failed not on how long it's taken not on these different things but you're going to be dwelling on the goodness of God Amen why you're going to keep pressure on your other senses to keep them clear keep the holy spirit inside there so things don't get to come in Amen brother Braham says this what was the matter he says you had to open the Channel first you got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word he is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop it then there's nothing can every one of the other channels is cleared out just like an old boiler with the flu stopped up if you put a fire in it it'll blow your thing up right because it can't hold the pressure very long that's what the matter with so many blowed up Christians is because they didn't clean the channels out they don't go down to the inside You' got to clean it conscience memory thoughts laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with that unadulterated word of God that it's the truth you look at it you'll see it so many times special meetings who comes to special meetings everybody people that haven't been to church for days weeks months everybody comes to special meanss and they come in there and they've got this little special need or this special request and what happens is they're coming in and it's all out here and they're trying to bring it in they're trying to get something something that'll take them to the next set of meetings the next Camp the next this the next that brother Brown says that's what blows Christians up is that they don't have this all worked out and so they're coming in trying to force it down through it and they're trying to take it through an intellectual side as opposed to a faith built side in their soul amen it blows you up that's what he says it blows you up if you're not taking care of the inside and you're trying to bring stuff in it's not going to work he says you got to get it settled in here and then it can flow out amen let's take this into the scripture very familiar scripture Isaiah 59:19 says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him I want you to catch something here it says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the enemy wasn't in there in the first place the enem is outside man we're talking about Believers here the enem is out here so what does that mean about the spirit spirit's got to be here because the spirit raises up a standard amen right so when the enemy comes in the one that is already there is going to raise up the standard so if you don't have the Holy Spirit what are you left with when Satan comes in your mind you're going to fight with your mind all in all over and over and over and the battles of the mind you're never going to win on your own amen we know you don't win a mind battle with the mind you've got to win it with the Holy Spirit in your soul amen but it says what's on the inside is going to raise up the standard so on the believer the spirit is the one that's on the inside and then it says it raises up a standard now what's a standard we don't think of this so much today but back in the days way back when they always had a standard in the armies and it was to identify what whose Army it was who was leading the army right so if there was a king there then he'd have a flag he'd have a standard or he'd have a a gold or a brass you know figure of some sort on a on a high pole and as long as that standard was up in the air they knew that the the king or the general or whatever was alive and well and he was in control so he the scripture is saying now when the enemy comes in like a flood the Holy Spirit raises up a standard and says somebody's already here right this place is already occupied and now we're identifying who's in the battle and the spirit is is fighting for me now amen so the battle isn't mine the battle is the holy spirit cuz the Holy Spirit raises up the standard and all I've got to do is keep feeding that Holy Spirit opening up those channels to him and he raises up a standard and the battle's over before it starts cuz the Satan can't defeat the holy spirit amen he can keep pushing he can keep shoving he can keep fighting but he's never going to break through amen the holy spirit's the one raising up the standard it's not me fighting the battle it's the holy spirit inside of me and what is the standard the standard for the holy spirit is always the word it's always the word it's never going to be a Ministry it's never going to be a man it's never going to be an idea or a Doctrine it's going to be the word over and over and over again how do you know that's what Jesus defeated Satan with the first time it is written it is written it is written thus sayeth the Lord thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord and that's what the holy spirit's using in the believer's life amen amen now brother Brandon watch how he starts to address these channels these Gates these senses to our bodies this will help you when you're dealing with something because we want to say you know and often we hear this idea of well just ignore it you know don't don't pay any attention to your reason don't pay any attention to your memory or your affection or these different things if you're feeling bad don't pay attention to it you know if you're sick don't pay attention to your senses but that's not what brother Braham says watch what he says here he says there it is right there those channels he says you just get them open up don't just bypass them cuz so often we're saying well those aren't redeemable those aren't those aren't under you know that's not the sav portion of our body so let's just bypass them he says no no no don't bypass him he says open them up and push this now through them right bring them under subjection bring them under control so that the Holy Spirit can flow through them don't bypass them where you want to bypass them is on the way in but on the way out now we've got to bring this whole thing under subjection so he says don't go around them go through them let the Holy Spirit clean them out and push these things out of your life so that you can have full full Victory amen he says when Satan walked up to even said you know the fruit is Pleasant she stopped for a moment well that's when she made a mistake when she stopped for a moment he says don't stop for nothing you've got the message Jesus lives this is the message he says Jesus Lives God Is A Healer that's the message don't stop for nothing no reasonings no nothing else but he's saying don't go around them go through them don't let them hold you up just pound it through amen just drive it through fill them with the word of God and that's how you're going to sedu them fill them with faith fill them with the holy spirit amen now brother br's dealing a lot with healing in this service cuz this is what most people came to his meetings for right and he starts to address this idea of why do some people get healed and other people not and why is it that some take longer and some don't and and these different things like that amen and we know God's working on different things in our lives and he has a purpose and he has a plan so Deliverance isn't always immediate we know that especially when we're talking about things in the spirit realm when we start getting into relationship issues emotional issues memory issues past experience past failures past hurts and these different things that can take a long time before God will actually clear that out but even with physical healing sometimes it happens immediately and sometimes it takes a while amen but we know that it has to be by faith these things happen by faith they don't happen by emotion they don't happen by the education these different things it has to be by faith so there's a moment of faith that occurs and in that moment that's when the work is done in time right it's a finished work everything that we've got here is done Deliverance is done healing is is done salvation's done all of it's completed it's a finished work man that's what Calvary did for us but we're a creatures of time and so there's this element here that we've got to deal with and that's that God doesn't always deal with it right then and there he may be dealing with it but the finished work may come in time or it may happen immediately so brother Bram says this he says when that bomb of Faith drops in there in the soul with the word of God behind it it blows every devil every sickness every disease you say is that right brother brandom when that then why why does it on some and not on others he says it's because of the channel you look out you can look out and see it but you got to have it in here so he says you can look out and see he says your eyes are here and they're looking out and they're seeing healing here you just pick this up so I can do this so he says you've got to have it in here looking this way he says not out there looking in you got to be in looking out so you can't come through reason you can't come through these things we've got to come right down God's channel of it right into the soul remember when we're looking for something to come in we've got to bypass all those things and get it here but when it's in here now it's got to push through those things right so it's a bit of an odd thing you skip them on the way in but then you you subdue them you bring them into subjection on the way out amen he says you can't come through these other things you've got to come right down God's channel of it right down into the soul this is where we start in the service amen so like I said people are looking at these things as if they're outside and if you got the Holy Ghost everything you have need of is in here right it's like if you take a teaspoon of the ocean you got everything that's in the ocean within you and when you take a portion of the of the infinite God you've got everything you need inside of you amen it's God's life himself amen but so many of us are trying to do what we're trying to bring it through here we're saying well could it be true some of us are believing for for tremendous things in our lives and we're saying could it be true true why cuz we're we're fighting in the mind that's the battle of the mind we're saying could it be true could it be for me is this for me is this something I'm going to have to deal with take it back to the word the word never left anybody no no believer ever stayed under those things even Paul look at brother Brandon brother Bram fought those stomach issues his entire life until just before the end and then it was a finished work he had a battle but there was always a Deliverance at the End Amen and it's sticking through the times that you've got to hold on that's the difficulty isn't it when it's lingering and you say Lord I've done everything i' I I've had to I believed your word my life is Sanctified I'm not doing anything I shouldn't my conscience is clear why isn't it happening that's the trial of your faith having done all to stand stand that's the point stand and stand and stand and keep the standard of the word by the holy spirit in your life and stand and stand and stand and say Lord I believe it's like John Ryan amen the blind man that went up brother Brown said you're healed he came back that evening I believe and said I thought you said I was healed he said I thought you said you believe he went out and testified two weeks later he's in the barber chair and his eyes come open he could see right the trial of your faith is what it's doing and the thing is when you have that Victory now you start moving on to the next thing and things start to fall a little more quickly because why you can see what God is doing in your life and you've become a real weapon in his hands amen what is it that little bit of disbelief brother Braham says if and if one little ioda of God's word was dis disbelieved and caused all this trouble how are we going to get back by dis disbelieving the word you can't do it you've got to shut off all these other things conscience memories and say reasonings and all these other things casting down reasonings we don't reason about it at all nothing at all we just accept the word upon the basis that God said so and that sets a stream between you and God every channel comes open between you and God then so when that Soul stream is open the is filled with the holy spirit the mind is open by faith that's when something starts to happen amen like I said sometimes it's immediate sometimes it takes a while but the mountains got to move because everything is opened up and it's God that's moving not you how foolish you you think Satan's out there trying to tell us to believe for the things that we're believing for S Satan has better things to do than to try and get us to believe God's word he doesn't want to tempt Fate on the chance that you're a Believer and you believe it and he gets kicked out amen he doesn't work against himself like that if you're believing in a promise if the if the word of God has been quickened to you that's the Holy Spirit that's doing that it's not Satan so Satan's never going to try and get you to believe that amen it's the Holy Spirit that's bringing that to your attention that's quickening it to you brother Braham says when God can get a man in his hands till he gets the senses conscience everything cleared out until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there that's right he come around and say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to God it shines out certainly just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God see that's the main thing what does it say you don't feel any better what does he say hallelujah glory to God you don't feel any better you don't look any different nothing's changing glory to God hallelujah that just means it's one day closer amen so when everything is cleaned out he says when God can get a man in his hints and he gets all of these things cleaned out until it's just God standing there with his Spirit there's not a devil that can poke a doubt in there that's when you become a weapon in the hands of God Amen that's when you become a a a a devil killing tool in the hands of God in your life and in the life of others amen often he starts in you and then he starts to use that for others and you'll see people that get healing that get delivered that get all these things you what's the best person to testify of Salvation so one to just got saved isn't it the one that just got something is the one that's going to it's going to flow from them to the next one the next one and it's going to Quicken the faith and it's going to Quicken the word to those different people because they see a reality in the experience that they themselves have maybe not experienced yet amen so you become a a wrecking crew against the the powers of hell if you'll hold on Amen why because instead of fighting your own self your own senses your own Gates and your own channels in your faith it's the Holy Spirit doing the work in you and it turns this all into wug big channel for for God everything is a channel for God then amen this was sent on the group chat a while ago and it was was already in here he says who will be like David and said you stand and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the Living God I'll go fight him amen God wants men and women this morning who can raise up and say I'll take the Lord at his word amen no matter what fails where this and that and what that one did that has nothing to do with it you SS and so forth if you're afraid of them get back you belong but God's Army is moving forward amen Men of Valor men of Faith men of power men of understanding they don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated they have to be channels they have to be channels God takes those little channels we're talking about like I said when everything here has been cleaned out scoured out by the Holy Spirit and it's full of the Holy Spirit now you've got just one big channel for the might and the power of God to move in in your life and in other people's life he says God takes those little channels what is it little Davids that'll just take him at his word and step forward and fight amen a life fully surrendered to the holy spirit is a channel for God that's what we're talking about fully surrendered cleaned out scoured out surrendered to the will of God that becomes a weapon in God's hands amen and even if you're young in the Lord all he needs is one channel cleared out when you get all of them cleared out that's great but the thing is these are this is going to be going on your entire life okay the battle doesn't happen in one day and then everything's cleared out you're going to be fighting things over and over and over again when we're reading brother braham's life story and these things how many times does you know the Holy Spirit tells him to do something he thinks it's his own thoughts he's not sure if it's God moving this that and the other thing there's doubts come in and these different things and he still got to deal with that and it's no different with us you're always going to be fighting that's right but just because you're fighting doesn't mean God isn't there the very reason you're fighting is because God is there and Satan's trying to get in on your territory again so the battle's always going to be there amen but if the holy spirit's there then Victory is imminent it's always imminent amen it's always ready to come out amen that's what we're looking for just keep those channels full of the Holy Spirit and God can use you anytime any place amen you'll still battle in certain areas until the word of God is full control of your life but that doesn't mean he can't use you man he'll take whatever portion of you that he's got full control in and he'll use it brother Bram said this he said God is calling every Seed of Abraham this morning to that same kind of Life The Great Battle is on now worldwide God wants his children separating themselves from what see taste feel smell hear imaginations conscience memories reason affections everything open up their mind and let the word come in and March with the word that's a real Soldier so we start to wind down I'm going to finish this with a a scriptural example to show how this works you say how do I get my eyes to do things that they to go against what they see if I can feel something how do I believe beyond what I can feel let's look at that Romans 4 this is speaking of Abraham it says who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which is spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith so Faith was not his weakness Faith was his strength it says he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb so he did not reason he did not dwell on his condition he did not entertain the possibility of failure even though his body no longer functioned properly when it came to fathering a child he literally has no capability in his body to father a child and the scripture says he considered it not this is what we're talking about now this is the father of our faith and this is what we're talking about overcoming the battle of the amen taking the battle and winning the gate it says he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God now notice it was says he was strong in faith giving Glory why because he was so far gone he was so old he was so decrepit that there was no part of him that could make this happen so he's giving all the glory to God because he says Lord there's nothing that I can do to make this promise come to pass I am so far gone even though I'm not dwelling on I'm so far gone that there is definitely no part of me that's going to make this thing come to pass so he says I'm giving all the glory to you because when this happens it will only be you that does it when the doctors have thrown up their hands when the church has thrown up their hands when my family's thrown up their hands when everybody has says it can't happen yet I'm giving you glory because it's your work from start to finish anyways and I have no part in it all I'm doing is standing here and saying I believe your word and giving glory to you and that's it amen and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform so he gave Glory why because he's persuaded that what God told him was going to come to pass and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now listen to this says now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead amen we have great and precious promises equally impossible as Abraham right what's yours what's your promise you're claiming equally impossible I'm sure might be 25 years might be 30 years if you've got a chronic condition anything like that what they were all taking care of at Calvary it was all taken care of and when he rose from the dead now we're the ones that are going to be resurrected you talk about an impossibility we're not going to die folks but why do we give glory to God because I can't keep myself alive for a millennia but he's going to keep me alive forever I can't raise up a dead body but he's going to raise one up like his glorious body I can't do that so what do we do we say Lord we give you the glory and we give you the praise this isn't our doing this is your doing from start to finish amen so and in doing so it's imputed to us for righteousness the exact same way it was for Abraham our response to those great and precious promises our belief our expression of Faith to him is imputed to us for righteousness the same way amen who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification Amen brother Bram closes with a little story and I'm going to do the same thing now listen to this closely as we close because this is going to be the attitude of the believer when it comes to every promise of God it says like a chicken in an egg what if he's afraid to peep what if he's afraid to pip the egg what if the little chicken inside the egg the little bird was afraid to hit the eggshell what if he would have heard a sound on the outside say don't hit that shell might hurt yourself how many people are telling us just deal with it it's never going to change hasn't changed yet why do you think something's going to change now in the future right listen to this but nature itself in the bird tells him peck it knock a hole in it amen when you're a born again child of God filled with the Holy Spirit what is your nature your nature is to believe the word of God your your nature is to fulfill the word of God your nature is to expect the word of God your nature is to manifest the word of God and the word has nothing the world has no idea what that nature is like and so they'll stand on the outside and they'll say don't Peck at that shell don't try and do that don't believe that don't look for that because it's silliness you need to do this this this and this anything except Peck that shell I'll help you get out right what is it the world knows nothing about the nature of God but you do because you have it inside of you amen he says let all the or organizations say days and miracles are passed you're going to hurt yourself you're going into fanaticism Peck right against the shell just as hard as you can Hallelujah Satan get away I'm coming out of here that's it I'm not laying here anymore I'm not sitting here anymore I'm not on this old Devil's Ground no more I'm pipping my way out this morning amen I'm an eagle amen hallelujah but that little old Eagle that trip Hammer neck back there pecking against that shell no matter how hard the shell was it pecked right on through it first thing you know he could flop his wings a little he was all right Peck your way out that's right how do you do it blasting it with thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord finally you begin to smell some fresh air thus sayeth the Lord get your head on the outside thus sayeth the Lord push hard now he says you're coming out he says and then he never goes back to that shell again amen he's free oh my that word once it gets set down through all those senses and consciences and things to get settled down here and that mind opens up and lets it oh God have mercy there's never nothing to bondage it again you're free he who the son has made free is out of the shell your denomination can never call you back the devil can never do anything more to you he can hiss and howl then what's he saying now he's just not talking about a new birth here he's talking about everything that comes against the believer every bondage everything that Satan tries to put on you every sickness every complex every insecurity that comes against you whatever it is that he's facing you with every single one of those things he says treat them just like you're in the shell and don't let anybody tell you you can't get out or that you have to go another way amen he's talking about anything that comes against you not just the new birth he says grab the faith that sword of the spirit thus sayeth the Lord scream hallelujah amen then cut down every enemy in front of you amen there it is cut every enemy if an old spooky Spirits makes you feel cut that thing away with the word of the Lord but our strength is the joy of the Lord is my strength get away from me whack you cut them with the word whether it be demon whether it be enemy whether it be sickness whether it be disease whatever it is take that word and pull it with a sword and if you whack it the first time and it doesn't seem to move whack it again and whack it again and whack it again and whack it until you chipped a hole through like a little chicken peeping itself out or an eagle which is what you are peep yourself right out through that old Shell of sin sickness cut your way out and say hallelujah where's the next one amen that's the battle that's a soldier that's the soldier of the Cross yes sir knock every enemy out he says why why he says we a predestinated royal Seed of Abraham when Abraham denied everything that was against God's word he's chopped his way right through every obstacle that come
