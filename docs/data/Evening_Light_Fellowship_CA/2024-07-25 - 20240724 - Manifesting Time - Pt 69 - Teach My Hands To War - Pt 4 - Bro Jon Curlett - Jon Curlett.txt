blood filled with your spirit Lord anointed ones at the end time Heavenly Father Lord I pray once again you'd Lift us up a little higher tonight Lord that you would encourage our hearts Lord that you would give us Lord what we have need of Lord not what we think we have need of Lord but truly what we have need of this evening Heavenly Father Lord you see our hearts our Li Our Lives Lord our innermost being Lord I pray you just help us to line up with your word again tonight Lord grant us Grace to give it Grace to receive it equally we pray Lord and have your way in your people in your name we ask it amen amen God bless you each one turn if you would to Colossians chapter 3 Colossians chapter 3 greet each one in the name of Jesus Christ it's good to see brother Jim and sister Lynn and sister Patricia and sister Florence back with us and Lord willing they travel out tomorrow that's still the plan to go back to BC and honestly brother Jim you look like nothing ever happened to you You' got your tan you've got your smile on your face and that twinkle in your eyes so we praise the Lord amen God is good he is so good that he's allowed a soldier to stay with us you know scripture says precious in the eyes of the Lord are his Saints when they go but I'll tell you we sure miss them when they go and I'm so glad brother that that that God has left brother Jim with us for for another while that we can fight shoulder-to-shoulder amen so brother Jim God go with you God bless you each one and it's been good to have the fellowship and uh I for one I'm not sad that you had to stay a little bit longer so uh hopefully next time you can stay longer without the without the health issues but God bless you each one want to remember Jonathan and Selena will both be traveling this weekend to British Columbia to go to Camp so we pray that God would go with them keep them safe make them a witness give them a witness and do a a special work in their lives and the many other young people that are traveling as well and then also brother Carmen Mills will be ministering for us on September 15th just one service on the Sunday he's got a busy schedule but I'm going to be gone for two weeks um only one Sunday but two weeks and so I've reached out to him and he's happy to do that so uh remember that I believe he'll be bringing his wife as well this time so just so we know that and then brother Paul will take certainly one of the Wednesdays possibly two of them as well while I'm gone amen Colossians chapter 3 and verse 5 says mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry now most of those aren't words we know so I ran to the Amplified and it said so kill deprive of power the evil desire lurking in your members those animal impulses and all that is Earthly in you that is employed in sin a man without the Holy Ghost is a beast that's what he is that's what we fell we fell from being sons of God from daughters of God to our Beast nature in Eden when we we lost that relationship with Christ he says these are those things that are within you sexual vice impurity sensual appetites Unholy desires and all greed and covetousness for that is idolatry he says the deifying of self and other created things instead of God we're talking tonight as you'll see we're going to take another service on the worship of a weakness but he says the deifying of self it's worshiping our natural tendencies it's putting them above the word of God putting them above the spirit of God and allowing them to have control in our lives but notice now these are all things you do with your body but then he says for which thing sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of Disobedience but then he continues and he says in the which ye also walk sometime you all have dealt with this he says he says when ye lived in them that's the past tense that ought to make us say hallelujah this evening amen that we used to maybe be there but by God's grace we're not there tonight but then he continu he says okay you've done all of that but he says now also put off all of these and we start to look at this and we realize uh oh as far as I know we're not engaging in fornication but look at this list he says anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth now Paul has moved from the outward expression the outward beastly acts and now he's moving to something that has seen in the mind and in the heart this is the expression of what's really inside of you this is intentions now amen these are anger rage bad feelings towards others curses and slander foul or abusive language amen these are emotions and reactions to things and then he says lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him see we were supposed to be created in the image of God and we were created in the image of God in the origin of all these things Adam was created in the image of God the scripture says but what happened is we fell from God's God's position and God's image and we were tainted by sin and now we're in the image of something other than God in our nature in our flesh in these different things and Paul says hey you put on a new man in a new image this is not the old man with the old image now you put on a new man with a new image and so watch out for these things because they're still sticking around if you're not careful you've got to bury these things you've got to kill these things amen God bless you this evening you can take your seats and as I said we're continuing our series on manifesting time and and we've got a a subtitle of teach my hands the war and then we got a Subs subtitle of the worship of a weakness and this is our second part with this and I apologize for those that weren't here for the last service because it may not make so much sense as as it it would have if you heard that but just hold in there with me those of you that weren't there but I wanted dig into this idea of weaknesses some more today and and I know this can be difficult amen I I'm being very pastoral with these things but I want you to know I'm not here with a message of condemnation I'm not I'm here with a message of hope I'm here with a message of Promise amen Satan's message beats you down God's message convicts you and then it takes you up to where his word says you ought to be amen but it's never easy to confront ourselves it's never easy to stand in front of the mirror of God's word and see that my life is different than what his word says but that's what we're here to do remember we read that that quote last service where brother brandham says when you come to church you come here to see those little things that need to be changed where you're off a little bit where you aren't matching up with the word of God and those things are what we come to church to correct we're not just here to get a pad on the back we're here to be corrected by the word and it's not always a spanking it's a simple telling you the truth of the way things are that's it that's where correction starts it's instruction is correction at its lowest at its first level then from there it moves to reinforcement then it moves to discipline then it moves to punishment amen and all these different things but so often we just we like to sit here and we say this is who I am and we say God loves me and God does love you but he doesn't love you in the way that would keep you the way you are God loves you enough to change you into His Image not to leave you in the broken image that we're in in this flesh amen amen but I've got a Bible that says that we don't have to stay there amen I've got a life that says we don't have to stay there not because mine is perfect but I know what I used to be and I know what I am now and they are not the same thing Hallelujah but I spoke in last service about some of my own struggles as a husband as a father how my upbringing broken home these different things influence that you know some of the the the aspects of of my struggles in my life I talked about my genetic background coming from an Easter European and German bloodline which doesn't put a whole lot of importance on emotions as far as Germans are Contin concerned we have two emotions that's it and so that bleeds into things that bleeds into family it bleeds into into church it bleeds into Ministry and marriage and these different things and so I had to come to a place where I said Lord there's got to be more than what I've got amen and there has to be more than the these things that I struggle with and so we we talked about excuses last service and how when we react the wrong way when we snap when we overreact when we shut down we always have a reason for it and in our own minds those may seem plausible or reasonable but just because they seem reasonable doesn't make them reasonable and it certainly doesn't make them true and it definitely doesn't make them right amen it might be it be that way to me and I might think I've got it but it doesn't always point to the root of the problem and the answer to our problems is not just this is the way I am there's a beast nature that we're fighting there's a there's a natural instinct in this flesh that we have to be able to push back against and what the first thing that gets that out is to put away the excuses and say God let your word be a be truth let your words be truth and let everything else be a lie and not rest in these things amen and so we saw that ultimately what happens is as these things are are in our lives and in our in our nature and whatnot people start to tiptoe around us and they start to not talk about certain things and they start to not do certain things about us and let me tell you church that is not the Liberty which in Christ has made us free when we've got a tiptoe around our spouse when we've got a tiptoe around certain people or certain things in the church that is not what Liberty looks like that is not what God has ordained for a bride in this last age amen we are to be free how often did did they did Brother Paul in particular talk about he who the son is set free is free and did indeed when he was here and I believe that the part of this is facing up to where we come short and things that we've inherited and and hurts and offenses and and just facing up to it and saying Lord I want to move past it I want to move past it I don't want to worship it I don't want to force people to bow down to be in bondage to the way that I react and the way that I do certain things so Jesus said in John he says then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free then he'd continue in John 14 he'd say I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you there's the key to this whole thing Church shall be in you he says I will not leave you comfortness comfortless I will come to you what the spirit of Truth you know the world says the truth hurts and there is some truth to that amen but the intent of Truth is not to hurt you the intent of Truth is to free you amen God never said I'm going to set you free and it would feel good he said I'm going to set you free and I'm going to set you free by the truth its purpose is to give you Liberty not to make you feel good about how you are right now that is not what it's supposed to do he says the spirit of Truth is a comforter not to leave you in your current condition but to make a way for you to come into the condition that God wants you to be in amen the comforter is not a coddler God is not a coddler and we're going to get into that a little bit later amen but the the comfort that we have is that if we walk in the light of God's truth then everything we go through is for our good and we know that he'll do nothing to us except we are needful of those different things then he would continue in John 14 he says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father shall send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you now catch this this is what the comforter does peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you he says let not your heart be troubled neither NE Let It Be Afraid so in other words the spirit of Truth brings peace and it casts out fear and then what it does is it takes those things that are so difficult in our lives and it says you don't have to worry or fear about those coming out in first in John 16:13 he says this how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whato ever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come you I was studying on this and and I have a fair bit here tonight if I'm honest and so I I had to trim some things out but brother brandham would say he says the holy spirit is the prophet he's the prophet for the age because what happens is we tend to look at the prophet and we say well that's it it all stops with the prophet he says no you've missed the mark the Holy Ghost is the prophet and he sends a fivefold Ministry to work through those men to work with what's in your life it's to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart it's to preach and bring the word to your life as it's needful and that is the holy ghost that does it that is not a man that does it if by God's grace your need is met tonight it is not because I sat down and studied it is not because I knew something it was not because I did something it is because the holy spirit is here to speak into your life that is the only way this works otherwise we just end up with religion and denomination and I don't want any of that amen but we're all born in sin we all have flaws and faults and the word is here to correct it amen to bring us subject to the authority of the word of God not here to beat us over the head God's not here to be unnecessarily cruel or painful or any of those things but the word is here to set us free and let me tell you when you've been in bondage things get a little creaky and things get a little tense and tight me if you've ever had to sit in one position if you've ever been to a uh you know maybe to a conference or something and they didn't get give you a bathroom break for the first 4 hours and you get up everything is stiff and your muscles are sore because it's it's gotten used to being in a certain position and when your bonds are broken when you haven't been able to move or exercise guess what things are going to be a little tender for a while but that doesn't mean you're not free amen sometimes the pain is proof that you're free that you're moving on from these different things amen but I want you to see he says the spirit of Truth when he's come he'll guide you into all truth that is a Journey it is not instantaneous you do not get the Holy Ghost and then know everything and lose everything bad and gain everything good you have the potential to fulfill every word of God that is meant for you when you get the Holy Ghost but it is not an instantaneous thing we see that in every person in the Bible even Christ himself grew and matured so we do as well amen so it's not a certain thing but it always leads us into the word of God that's needful for our lives and evil for the age that we're in amen the holy spirit always points the believer to the word for their age remember brother Braham says we cannot live in the glare of another age we cannot live in the message of another age moses' message was true but it's not for us we can apply it to our lives but it is not for us our message is in Revelation three our message is in Revelation 10 our message is in Malachi 3 and 4 and these different things it's in the book of Ephesians and that's where the holy spirit is pointing us to but he's a comforter he's a guide he's a discerner amen it's not me or any minister or any gifted person that does it it is the holy spirit that achieves these things in the believer's lives it has nothing to do with me amen and when the Holy Spirit puts a finger on our lives then we've got to see beyond that man to see that it's God that's speaking even if the man knows something and that's when you have to be able to trust your pastor that's when you have to be able to trust the minister is that when they speak things that you know apply to you that you say he's not preaching at me he's preaching in for my good amen because he loves me because he's concerned about me and it's God that's doing it it's not a man that's doing it believe me there are things that I have said and that I'm going to say that are extremely uncomfortable for me to say because I know that there are people that they apply to in a very specific way and it's going to seem like I'm preaching at them and this has happened it it happens all the time it's not just this this particular message or service but I have to stay true to what I've been led to preach amen that's that's all I've got and and I may walk out feeling very uncomfortable and wondering what people are going to think but in the end it's in your lap and it's up to you what you'll do with it amen amen so the holy spirit is not just here for the preaching of the word it's here for the fulfilling of the word amen that's it's it because it's power behind the word that does it but it's a guide it's a comfort it's a teacher it's a revealer of the word it's here to bring all the clarity that we need to our lives now we're talking about worshiping a weakness this evening and I want to share a story with you about a woman that was bound and brother Brandon talks about this and she came for a visit because she was so torn up because she'd Fallen away from the life that she had been living now I want you to catch what she Fallen away from because she's convinced that Satan had gotten a hold of her and now she was full of demons watch how this unfolds now so she's talking to brother Bram she said well one Minister told me I had seven devils and the other lady Minister said I only had five now there's two of them gone somewhere so she came and stayed in in his house there about two hours in the house until God began to speak and said lady listen you come from St Louis she saides how'd you know it I said your husband's on the police force that's right and I said you used to be a lovely housekeeper she said that's right I said recently your house looks like a hog pin this is her falling this is her failure she said that's right she said your daughter I said your daughter's over there now taking care of your husband' she said that's right who told you that notice the symptoms now she's got a problem she used to be a good wife she used to be a good housekeeper but she has completely let her house go she's no longer being a husband to her or a wife to her husband and things have gotten so bad that her daughter has had to come and take care of the house for her and she's convinced that Satan has gotten a hold of her life by demonic power okay and so she's gone and she's gone to a minister and he says you've got Seven Devils she goes to a lady Minister she says five she's sitting there saying where did the other two go I'd be like at least I got rid of two but she saiding where did the other two go what happened why did they leave she's all broiled up she's all roiled up because she's got a literal failing in her physical life brother Bram says I just kept talking because I was in a vision and I said you went down to a little place first you went to a doctor yes he gave you shots yes those shots were called hormones yes she didn't tell him that she told him about the two ministers and then he repeats he says you went down to a place and they told you you had Devils yes because you had a real funny feeling yes they sent you to California yeah and some man told you you had Seven Devils yes you went to a woman she said you had five Devils yes and they told you to come to me that's right she said how did you know that I said the holy spirit said so amen the Holy Spirit is here to reveal all things to lead you into all truth now listen to what he says I said you haven't got any Devils to begin with that's right she said I haven't I said no I said lady surely you know your mother went through menopause it's the menopause something natural and I said what do you think those hormon shorts are for she said I don't know I said it's for the change of life that's what it is no Devils at all it's just absolutely your condition of life she's so bound up because some preacher told her something and then another one came and confirmed it that she thinks she's demon-possessed but as soon as he tells her what the real problem is he says she began to relax my wife was cooking she had said earlier I cut it out for the sake of time she says I will not eat until I am delivered my wife was cooking some bacon and eggs out there and she began to look through the house and I said kind of hungry she refused to eat then she said yes she went out and ate three eggs a big bunch of toast two cups of coffee a lot of jelly and she was just as happy as she could be praise the Lord then she said are you going to pray for me and cast it away I said cast what away she said the thing I said there's nothing to Cast Away she said well I Never Felt So Good In My Life Church what has changed in her body nothing not a single thing has changed but she says I've never felt so happy in my life she said whatat must I do here's the medicine go home straighten up your house do what you should have been doing all along he doesn't say you're a horrible woman he says go do what you're meant to do cook your husband a nice big apple pie about that thick and I'll bet you he does that amen praise the Lord then when he comes in tonight throw both arms around him kiss him sit down get on his lap and tell him you love him and Live Like a Lady ought to he says that's exactly that's all there is how carnal see sometimes we get so bound up in Satan that we forget there's things in this body that just are the way they are okay women you're going to deal with hormones you deal with them every month in a fluctuating cycle guess what there's going to be days when you don't feel like cleaning your house there's going to be days when you don't feel like cleaning there's days when you don't want to be around anybody and guess what it ain't Satan it's just this flesh you live in amen us men we pretty much only have one thing and we're just flat all way slight Rises for stress slight Downs for vacation time but otherwise we're mostly level most of us not all of us most of us but you and you deal with that all the time and Satan can get in there and he can start to use that against you and make you feel like you've lost something guess what we're living in Fallen flesh and you have ups and you have downs and that has nothing to do with your soul or your Eternal destination many times many times okay now watch what he says here brother John how are we going to get over these things he says see all the pouring on of oil all the Stomping kicking all the loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of good he says it's the truth that makes you free that's true he says ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free why am I saying this I'm saying seek God when you have a situation when you got a problem seek God you know what that woman needed she didn't need somebody to pray over her she needed somebody with a gift to wait on God to find the answer for her and tell her what her problem was and as soon as she realized this is only temporary this is only natural I'm going to get through it I'm going to make it I'm still a Christian I still have the Holy Ghost she relaxed you know when I was in Texas we got hit from behind in our car by a guy doing 80 kilometers an hour he never hit the brakes and what happened is I I was the LA I was the only one to see it and so I braced myself and so when he hit I was braced and so my body resisted the movement whereas everyone else in the car they just kind of you know from behind it would just drive you back into the seat and so that everyone was fine except for me and so I had constant pain in my back and I went through Chiropractic treatments and massage therapy and all these things and I did it for months and then I got insomnia from the pain and all these things so I couldn't sleep I couldn't go to work longer than 4 hours couldn't do anything I couldn't sleep I go in my car and drive till 2:00 and 3: in the morning just cruise around for something to do but what happened is eventually I got an MRI and they said you've got a bulging disc you've got a herniated disc it'll go away in time and almost as soon as I heard that I started being able to sleep and I started being able to go back to work and things started dissipating why I knew what it was now it took the stress away it took the worry away it kept the kept the laye away at night in bed looking up the ceiling wondering what in the world this is am I going to deal with it the rest of my life as soon as I realized what it was and that it was going to be okay then magically everything became okay nothing spiritual now Satan will jump on that and that's the spiritual battle but the actual problem is not a satanic thing it's just this body it's just the way it is amen listen to this he says for the word of God is quick that word means Alive Church that's what I love about what we believe we believe in a living God a present God a God that's here this very evening speaking to his people meeting their needs it's alive it's the I am it's the everpresent god the word of God is alive and powerful that's a beautiful thing alive is great but it's got power behind it that's even better it says and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing the under of Soul and Spirit making the difference between what's in you and what's trying to get into you he says of the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you know I've been reading I read the gospels in a loop a and I was reading there and Jesus is talking talking to the different ones and what happens is the thing that ticks them off the most is when he discerns what's in their life as long as it's about everybody else they're okay but the minute it says and they perceived that he spoke about them it says and they sought his life because he went to the source of their problem he exposed the root issue that was in them and they hated him for it because they knew it was true amen but see the truth came to them and because they were not of him they could not receive it but the truth comes to us and you can say the exact same thing to a Believer you can put a finger on their life by the word and they will say yay Lord that's me that's me why because we see the truth comes to set us free yes it exposes the issue but it is not there to embarrass us it's not there to shame us it's there to set us free amen God isn't exposing these things to embarrass us he exposes it so we can receive healing we can receive deliverance we can get a full Liberty amen from these things in our lives sometimes it sets our mind free like I was talking about my accident sometimes it sets our Emotions free I didn't know I had more than a couple until he set mine free now I know you're sitting there grinning and saying John emotional see I see one right here she can barely hold it in you think I'm not emotional now imagine what I used to be what there's a there were things that were B modled up that I had to learn to let go of and when I learned to let go of those things then all of a sudden I realized hey life isn't so bad in these areas you learn to let things go you learn to express it you learn to praise and the thing is it wasn't just in my personal life it was in my spiritual walk that I can now Express things to God it's okay to say I love you to someone it's okay it's okay to show appreciation to show affection in these different things I know most of you realize that but guess what that doesn't come natural to me and I had to learn those things and there was a liberty in those things anden it helped to change my life but our natural inclination is to hide from anything anything that brings up something in our life that might be embarrassing or shameful or or or stir up those triggers or those hurts or offenses and what not amen because it seems like there's a spotlight have you ever been in church and it just seems like the preacher has got a a thousand megawatt light on you and you can't escape from it I've been there many many times and and you think oh my goodness but it reminds me of my conversion is that when I stood in the light of his calling my name I didn't care that he was exposing all of my flaws because there was a love there there was a concern there there was a draw there was a pull that brought me into further into that light despite the embarrassment despite the shame I felt and it took almost 45 minutes for for me to get from my from my Pew up to the front to to to to give my heart to the Lord because there was such a big line up there but in those moments what he did was he cleaned me out oh what a wonderful feeling when he cleans you out and you feel not worthy but you feel accepted and I didn't worry about the light then because I was standing in the light of his grace not in the light of his judgment Hallelujah that's what his word comes to do is put his grace in our lives not to judge us to turn it down is to receive judgment to to accept it his grace upon Grace upon Grace amen his mercies are new every morning and it's a beautiful place for the believer to live in but we've got to accept the light don't run from the light church don't run from the light tonight Paul says this in Ephesians he says all things that are approved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever do make manifest his light I this is Amplified version it's a it's a a mishmash of multiples because some of them just said certain parts perfectly it said but all things having their true character exposed By the Light are made manifest for it is light that makes everything visible scripture says if we walk in the light as he is in the light and we have Fellowship one with another then the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all of our sins we cannot run from the light of the truth amen I've said it many times I don't believe this church runs from the light I'm Amazed by the things that you're willing to admit and and confess and come up and say that was just for me young and old alike that's a wonderful trait to have there are people that have come up for here up here for prayer and I've said it before I'll say it again anything you say to me me up here stays with me I don't tell my wife I don't tell the deacons I don't tell anybody but there are things that people have admitted to up here that took great courage to say I've got an issue and I say God bless you for doing that because that shows what's inside of you is that you want to be right more than you want to have an image that you want to be in his way rather than just have a facade of perfection in your life that's the believer that's going to overcome is the one that says I need some overcoming amen that's what makes you an Overcomers you have something to overcome inside of our Lives amen but see it's so so much simpler and so much easier isn't it to just take these things and push him down and push him down and put him in a wind put him in a a room with no windows and just lock the lock the door and and throw the key away but that's not the life of a Believer you know when I was studying this I looked at Peter because I want to encourage and I think this is a trap for the young people so many times but I think it goes for all of us is that we think we get the Holy Ghost and therefore we have no issues now maybe you don't think that but I know that's something that young people deal with because the question that every young person seems to to to to dwell on is do I have the Holy Ghost or not and see what Satan does is he comes in and he says oh you wanted to do that or you actually went and did it you don't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wouldn't do that well let's go look at some somebody who had the holy ghost that was a chief Apostle that had the Keys of the Kingdom and let's look at his life let's look at somebody we know had the Holy Ghost and let's see what he says and we're going to look at two tonight because Peter had a weakness and Peter's weakness was that he couldn't stand up for what he believed when it came to cultural differences he treated the Gentiles one way and then he treat them differently in front of the Jews remember what happened was that when they he was just with the Gentiles he'd eat with them he'd Fellowship with them but as soon as the Jews came then he would push the Gentiles away and he'd only spend time with the Jews and so the Jews think he's great but the Gentiles are saying oh so you don't really believe what you the message you got that Vision you had of coming to the Gentiles that that everything we do is accepted now that you can live as we do and God still accepts you you don't believe that and it was causing a division in the church the chief Apostle was causing a split in the church cuz he had a weakness and he was full of the Holy Ghost twice filled with the Holy Ghost catch this but remember now Paul comes to town and the word Prophet never backs down the word Prophet never backs down he says but when Peter was come to Antioch I was Steed him to the face because he was to be blamed he says I went to Peter one-on-one face to his face and I said you're the problem remember we're to walk in the light even when it's uncomfortable he says for before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other Jews dissembled likewise with them see everybody was fellowshipping together had a nice big group and then when Peter pulled away the other Jews that had accepted Peter's message of the Gentiles being partakers of grace and the gospel with them pulled away with Peter so now the Gentiles have lost all fellowship with the Jews it says fearing them which were they dissemble with him likewise in so much that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation so Peter's got a weakness and now everybody is following along and worshiping Peter's weakness because Peter's in such an honorable position nobody's willing to stand up to him listen if it's my weakness and I force you to bow to it and it takes you to a bad place guess who's responsible this guy cuz I'm bringing you to a place where you can't obey the word of God cuz I've got the influence I've Got The Power I've got the position I'm not saying I have it I'm saying if you're in that as parents as officers of the church members of the ministry whatever it might be if you have influence over people and your influence leads them to do wrong you answer for it amen that's the burden of leadership he says but Paul says but when I saw that they walked not U rightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before them all why there's one thing that brother Eugene taught me he said he taught all of us he said if your if your mistake is public your apology is public if your mistake is private your apology is private and guess what if you won't make it right then it has to happen in public that's the way it goes that's the escalation of the things inside the church Paul says I said to Peter before them all if thou being a Jew livest after the manner of the Gentiles and not as do the Jews Why compell Us th the Gentiles to live as du the Jews so Peter Paul says to Peter you're contradicting the very gospel you brought buddy what's up with that and Peter had to stand there and repent that was the only option because it was obvious to all of what his weakness was and how he had led astray the early church already just in that one little weakness he had in his flesh they put Peter's personal weakness above the good of the body and above the word Above All Else above the word that's what we're looking for here because the word puts the good of the body in it's right place amen we want to come under the the the the subjection of the word amen we're we're not to go around calling people out that is not a Ministry calling people out is not a Ministry there's a five-fold Ministry and none of them are calling people out okay but there are absolutely times where we have to have the courage to say to a fellow believer I'm sorry but the word says you're wrong and the hardest thing is if we've been letting it slide for days or weeks or months or God forbid years and we find have to go and say I'm sorry I should have said this a long time ago but you are off the word yeah I've talked to different ones at different times and I've had people come tell me um brother Joe shared a story actually and I won't tell it uh in in public but he there was a brother that told him he was doing these certain certain things and and it wasn't even a member of this church it was somebody away and and brother Joel just looked at him and he said brother what are you doing that can't be God's will for you and your family and he had to have that courage to stand up and say I love you enough as a brother and sister I love you enough as a spouse I love you enough as my child whatever it might be I love you enough to say that ain't right and that man came back to him and he says you're right we've gotten out of kilter with this we've let it go too far and now it's dominating our life and we hope after this you know maybe we'll we'll trim it back or these different things but the hardest thing is it's people we love it's people we honor it's people we respect it's people that are above us Elders even as it might be but that doesn't put anyone above the word they put Peter above the word and it split the church it's the accountability to the word that keeps us on the straight and narrow and that's what each one of us is here to do amen and the simple fact is sometimes we're on this road to glory and we start driving on the wrong side sometimes we get off on a detour and the worst thing is when we just stop and somebody needs to come along and say hey you need to get back to the middle or you need to get going or you need to come back from where you left off of doing these things and it takes courage to stop and say I love you enough to tell you this because that's the only motivator for this is love for that personen you know we talked about it's it's it's never a Ministry to go around and and call people out but there is a way that we speak to each other and there's a way to handle these things Paul does it in Galatians 6 Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted now I've seen my share of people going around that tried to correct people all the time and thought everyone was wrong I used to be one of them till I got converted we being honest if if I can't be honest I can't preach what's the point what's the point but I thought everyone was a hypocrite I've said this before this is not news I thought everyone in this church was a hypocrite because guess what none of you are perfect but here's the thing when I got saved and I started getting myself in the light of his word I saw enough of myself that wasn't perfect that I'm not too worried about whether brother Mark and sister Moren are perfect whether brother Gerald's a perfect Pastor whether I've got perfect parents or parent it didn't matter when I'm focused on myself I'm not looking at other people people but I saw that we're all believers we're all in the same boat we're all in the same fight and we're just trying to serve God but I'll tell you one thing Paul says here you know how somebody is in in a in a Godly correction mode check their attitude because if they're in it for a gotta or and I told you so or I'm right and you're wrong that is never of God that's not it but what he says if they're spiritual they will come in a spirit of meekness and Paul says that means you're coming with the full knowledge that but for the grace of God I'd be right there with you and I don't care who we are we can go there we can go there amen and God will sometimes let us fall just to help us know you're not all that in a bag of chips as they used to say Amen but one thing I have found is that people that are always making a habit of correcting others usually need it the most that is a life's lesson and I say that because I need needed it I say that by personal experience amen but you know sometimes the hardest thing we can talk about brothers and sisters in the in in the church we can talk about our our children even but the hardest thing to do is talk to our spouse because we know them inside and out and here's the problem they know us inside and out and so if I talk to my wife about something that's going on in her life you know what she has ammunition lots and lots of ammunition it's true because I ain't perfect and so what happens is when you start to talk to your spouse about something that they don't even maybe realize they're dealing with or they've dealt with for a long time or they're struggling with and you can see it and they seem to think it's not that big of a deal then what happens so often is they come back with but y you and they react and they shoot back and pretty soon it turns into a battle rather than a helping session amen or what they want is a hug and you've given them lots of hugs and it hasn't made a difference and so what they need is a Kumbaya session no a come to Jesus session amen I come to Jesus session to say this is bigger than you and it's affecting all of us it's it's affecting me it's affecting the kids it maybe even affecting the church depending on what it is but to sit down there and say I know you want a hug but we need to move past the hug and into the action stage we need to move to the getting better stage amen like we said God doesn't cuddle us he Comforts us along the way but he doesn't coddle us cuz codling leaves you right where you are remember we read that quote where brother bam said that God's talking to Moses and he's given him all the answers he's got a solution to every problem and every reason why he shouldn't be a deliverer and then by the end he points to the scripture where it says and God's anger was kindled towards Moses because he said Moses I've given you every answer and you still won't move he said and he gets angry with us he gives us a kick in the pants I love you but and he gives us a whack and says get on with it now stop being such a child can we say Amen I'm getting nervous because I I want to go into family weaknesses and inherited traits and these things just for a bit because these are often the biggest cause of issues in our families and our marriages and even within the church If we're honest anden you know and and we can look at this from two sides we can when it comes to Natural inclinations we can look from the bad and guess what look at my family we've got inclinations towards infidelity for Pride temper all these different things we also have good inclinations and we rather focus on those but I want you to see something because it doesn't matter if they're good or bad they're all in the flesh and in the end they're not going to get you to heaven and they're not going to give you the victory amen but I want to go into this by the scriptures we always want to go to the word for this I don't want to sit here and throw psychology at you or these different things but we want to go in the scriptures and I if we go to David's family we see a a beautiful picture of how these things can progress because David was a man after God's Own Heart and now that's something to be desired but it's not something to be inherited I can't get a good heart from my father my natural father or from my mother I can't inherit that that's a soul condition and that is ordained by God it has nothing to do with who my mommy or daddy was listen look at Rahab look at Ruth who were their parents idolators not exactly the best of the best and yet there was a seed Gene of God inside of them amen so it's not coming from them from from our parents but you see David generally lived a clean and Godly life and he made some pretty big mistakes but he was always quick to repent amen we're talking about worshiping a weakness the quickest way to get one of these weaknesses out of your life is admit you have it say you're sorry and ask God to take it out of your life that that's the simple thing I don't have any big answers for you here tonight except confess it apologize and make it right fathers I've learned the greatest thing you can do to your children is apologize when you step out of line amen remember we are not supposed to discipline them in anger if we're if we're spanking them if we're yelling at them that is not godly if we're doing it in Anger we are supposed to be doing it in love and I have had to repeatedly apologize to my children at times for doing things in Anger even though it's the right thing to do I did it the wrong way and I had to show them daddy ain't above the word daddy's not above apologizing and daddy's not above making it right that's the easiest way to teach those things to our children amen so David rules well and he stayed true to God and yes he had his mistake but he always came back but then we see Solomon come forward now and Solomon comes to the throne and God blesses Solomon with wisdom because he asks for it Solomon was like you and I he was not smart he was not intelligent above and beyond everyone he did not have wisdom above everyone remember what is wisdom is it's knowledge applied and that comes with experience and Solomon says I need wisdom I need experience without having it and God says you'll have it and because you ask for this cuz it's the best thing you could ask for is Young Ruler I'll give you everything else that you didn't ask for as well but we see what happened here was that David was pure before God and he always repented but if we look at David's life carefully we see David had a a particular weakness and it was women it was a woman if we want to be frank but the thing is is that David had always kept that covered up but as soon as David got out of his post of Duty now the natural flesh came in and David saw a woman and took her to himself and she was another man's wife so David had some issues with that but he got it under control how did he get it under control church he went back to his post of Duty that's what he did but now Solomon comes along and he's David's son by Beth Sheba so guess what basba has a problem with infidelity too so you got David has an infidelity problem you have BBA has an infidelity problem you put it together and what do you get a double dose of infidelity so so Solomon now potentially we would say in his body he has an issue that is worse than his mommy and daddy have church we look at our kids and wonder why they're struggling more than we did just realize sometimes they get a double dose of something we only have a half portion of and they're getting both guns from both sides of the family if they have it and they're fighting a battle that you've never had to fight we have to be so careful how we treat these things when we're dealing with our children amen that we're not hard on them for having some not so good traits and same with our spouses for that matter be gentle on me she smiled I think I'm good listen to this so David serves and he stays true to God all his way now Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites Z zidonians and Hittites and websites and of the Nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel now notice every one of these he says ye shall not go into them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods to marry these women to take these women to his bed whatever it was Solomon had to disobey a direct order from the word and what took him there one one step down the wrong path led to step number two led him to step 700 let him to step 1,000 one after the other see he didn't fix the mistake he kept it in his life and it brought him to the next one to the next one and to the next one it said and he had 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and his wife turned away his heart it says for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father for Solomon went after ashth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father Solomon started beautifully because he asked for wisdom but what happened is the further along he got in life and in his kingdom he started to try and make his kingdom prosper by politics rather than by the wisdom that God had given him and he started to rely on his flesh and on his mind and it took him completely out of the word of God so then Solomon dies and riabal takes his place now remember Solomon wasn't naturally wise but he ruled with wisdom because he asked for it so riab coming behind him does not have wisdom he's the same as everybody else and so rabam doesn't ask for wisdom of God he ask for wisdom of men and so he goes to the old men and they give him proper counsel and then he goes to young men his own age young people listen up if you're looking for wisdom do not go to young people your own age go for those that are ahead of you that have a proven track record of dealing with what you're wanting dealt with or making the decisions you're looking to make with it and so what happen is those young man what did they do they pump up his tires they make him feel good about himself they said hey riab it's time to flex your muscles it's time to show who's the boss and so he went out and he he he was going to make life harder for all of Israel and they said see you later and in one moment he drove the whole Kingdom right into a ditch and he lost the whole thing except for Judah they walked away from him wholesale so we go from David who was near perfect to Solomon who's going downhill and then Solomon passes it on to rabom and you have the same genetics coming all the way through there amen and watch how far this gets out we're only into the third generation now it says that and rabol the son of Solomon reigned in Judah and he was 41 years old when he began to Reign he reigned 17 years the city of the Lord to choose out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there and his mother's name now catch some of the issue here his mother's name was NE an ammonius so he's the son of Solomon and a woman that came from an incest incestuous background so his genetic pool is all messed up now remember Ammon came from lot it's from a daughter that laid with her father it says and and and what's the result of ri's rule Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all that their fathers are done so they were worse than anyone before them because riabal couldn't correct so for they also built them high places images Groves on every high hill and under every Green Tree and there were also sodomites in the land oh it's not just Sodom and Gomorrah now it's come into the children of Israel because guess what lot and his daughters left but they didn't really leave make Believers right says there were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the Abominations of the Nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel so now they've lost the victory completely they've lost the presence of God they've lost the worship of God they lost all morality and it comes back to a tainted King then after that we come into the fourth generation with abim who's riabal son and he's the grandson now of a foolish man with an ancestros woman and he's been raised by a father that says anything goes a father that refused to correct the people or his children and so we see he can't do anything good in himself it says now in the 18th year of King jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over Judah and he w walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as the heart of David his father and he slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David and ASA his son reigned in his dead now we're coming to the fourth generation and we think everything's doomed says and in the 20th year of jeroboam king of Israel reigned ASA over Judah and 41 years reigned he in Jerusalem and his mother's name was maah the daughter of abishalom now abishalom is Absalom so now he is the son he his mother is the daughter of absolum a man who had rebellion and pride and arrogancy and foolishness in him he's not coming from some great lineup but he's got a little bit of David in there it says and ASA did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord as did David his father and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers have made now watch this we're talking about worshiping a weakness he says and also make a his mother even her he removed from being Queen because she had made an idol in a Grove and ASA destroyed her Idol and burnt it by the Brook Kidron so ASA uses his position now to do things that his father wouldn't do brother Paul preached on a new generation and I'm Not For a Moment saying here that our parents did things we didn't do but one thing's for sure we've got a hold to the word when our parents have moved on Amen the the the young men that have come up and taken positions of authority and influence in this church we've got to hold the line amen we don't back away from those things one inch one inch because if we give Satan an inch he'll take a foot we give him a foot he'll take a mile we've got to hold fast to the things which we know are true and Ace has no respect of persons and so his mother is an idolator he says you cannot be in a position here don't worry I'm not trying to take anybody out of position but he says you can't do this you're an example to the people you're my mother and you're doing this and they're looking at you I'm sorry you cannot be in this position and he takes her out of position and he takes her idols and he destroys them but catch this cuz he's trying to hit the reset button he says but the high places were not removed but nevertheless asa's heart was perfect with the Lord all his days see we see here this thing and we're going to get into this in a moment with Paul ASA had a desire to do right but his courage only took him so far his natural inclinations could only take him so far and so he had an imperfect work but he did a great work and he brought them back to the true worship of God but what he didn't do was take away all of their Idols but he himself took it and he said an example amen but we look through there and we've got David was perfect Solomon started perfect and then went by way of idolatry and then riab comes and he's no good and then abim comes and he's no good and then we got ASA and he's a pretty good guy why am I saying this church I'm saying this to say it doesn't matter who your parents are it guarantees nothing good and it guarantees nothing bad bad we're going to deal with issues in these bodies that has nothing to do with anything as far as we can tell but it's there it's there just because of the Fallen nature the Fallen flesh that we live in our attitude our mindset our likes our dislikes our emotions our approach with people our words how we do all these things it's all tied to our family line and there's a natural inclination built into this body that each and every one of us is living in amen it's literally encoded into our bodies isn't is it amazing how you look and especially those of you that have multiple children how different you can have three or four children that come from the same couple why they're encoded different ways they've got a genetic structure there amen but here's the thing like I said earlier we want to make some of it good because it seems good and some of it bad because it's obviously bad but that is completely contrary to the word Paul said this Romans 7 are you with me this evening Paul says for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing you say well boy I I I've got a gentle nature and my son has it my daughter has it that's a good thing no sir Paul said there is no good thing we're going to get into why he says for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not he says even when we want to do good even if we have a natural inclination to do good somehow we seem seem to keep doing the wrong thing he says for the good that I would I do not and but the evil which I would not that I do can't do right when I want to and all I do is wrong even when I want to do right church this is a prophet speaking if he's got issues guess what we all have issues amen let's not get high on our horse and think well that's just the other people Amen brother Vel but then he jumps down like I said I'm not here to drag us down I'm here with a message of hope I'm here with a message of promise I'm here to show you what the word can do by the Holy Ghost but Paul says but I see another law in my members in my body Waring against the law of my mind he says I've got one thing up here and I've got another thing here he says and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members he says this body is bound in sin and there is no freeing the flesh it's always there it's hardcoded it's in your DNA to not do the things of God and he says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death now most of us know what's coming in re in Romans 8 but let me say this you will not get to Romans 8 unless you go through Romans 7 first because we have to realize where we are we have to realize the battle we're in we have to be honest about it we've got to know our strengths and our weaknesses because Satan loves to focus on those things but the thing is people always say I can't help it and you know what they're right when we say we can't help it we can't help it it's literally built into us there's something inside of them that's driving us okay can I I'll use myself when I look at my mom and my dad I can look at things and and I can see strengths and I can see lots of potential but I can see lots of weaknesses and with them come great pitfalls okay I could go on and on and guess what both my parents contribute to the good and both my parents contribute to the bad amen my mom is filled with the Holy Ghost that does not make her genetic predispositions perfect my dad is not serving the lord and does not have the Holy Ghost and doesn't that doesn't make what he brings any worse than my mom's it's just flesh and it's sinful flesh in those things amen but as I said earlier even the good things can be pitfalls maybe you know there are some people that are just born to work and you give them a task and they'll work and they'll work but here's the thing that can be taken and turned into workaholic you take somebody that's got Charisma and that can turn into somebody that is manipulating and seducing people it can be a good thing or it can be a bad thing and here's the thing in this flesh dwells no good thing and so it always leans to imbalance to destruction and to selfishness that's what this body is inclined towards because It Wants What It Wants and we think that because it wants it it must be good for it and that is obviously not true that's obviously not true amen but here's the thing I don't have to be bound by my strengths nor do I have to be bound by my weaknesses that's what we're here to talk about is to tell you they're in there but say you don't have to be bound by those things I don't have to fear those things I don't have to worry about those things in me in my spouse in my children why because I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me there's liberty for us amen I don't have to live in the fleshly inheritance of Lanny and Sandy klet I don't have to live there I don't have to worry about it listen Paul the Apostle came from a great family and look at all the issues he had but he didn't stay in those issues like I said many of you know my father I love him dearly but he's a very flawed person living in the reality of those flaws tonight I said it I mean it's true it's okay to say amen I won't be hurt by it as brother Gerald obviously saw there amen but if I stayed up and I and I I dwelt on the things that my father could potentially have passed on to me genetically I would never get any sleep amen but here's what I tell you what I do I guard my life against those things which have been shown to follow my family line and that's not fear that's Prudence amen listen we don't have a problem with alcohol but if we had alcohol there's one thing I would make make sure I never did and that's drink alcohol you know what we have in my in my dad's side infidelity so you know what that means is that anyone that I don't truly know and trust has the Holy Ghost I don't want to have anything to do with them if they're a female I put up a natural barrier there my wife and I were talking about this I said I don't even know when a woman's FLIR flirting with me anymore because I just am not looking for it and I don't even understand what they're doing why because I put a barrier there that says listen I have a wife that is the only woman I need a relationship with in this world and so every other woman gets put behind the wall of intimacy of any sort emotional physical intellectual all of those things there's only one woman for that and that's my wife why because I've seen what it does in my family and my dad suffered from it his dad suffered from it and I guarantee you that it's been hitting trees all the way down through our family line why so I guard that not out of fear listen I'm just following what the word says I should do in the first place but I'm extra careful about that because there's an inclination in my family for it amen we ought to guard Our Lives by staying away from anything that's sketchy anything that's against the word but if there's a natural inclination in the family above all guard those remember brother ra says the devil has one punch coming you've got one area of your life what I do is anything that I think could be there I guard it I guard it and I don't even open that door I don't even open that door by God's grace amen and that's our that's our part of it is to keep them covered not feed them but the point is this this body has all sorts of unsavory inclinations it has things it wants to do it has things it likes and the word says it's wrong and the body says but I want it anyways amen but here's the thing for the believer this body is not in control and if it is it doesn't have to be in control if I could put it that way Paul gives us hope Paul gives us answer for our weaknesses I love Paul because he's so honest about who he is and what he's dealt with and these different things and he spends all of Romans 7 telling us of this great battle of that that each one of us faces in these natural bodies these things that are inherited intrinsic to being in a fallen condition even as a born- again child of God it's okay to be honest with our struggles like he did in Romans 7 but we've got to make the step now into Romans 8 and Paul says this there is there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit remember what 1 Corinthians 12:13 says by one Spirit we're baptized into one body we are not under condemnation just because this body wants things that are against the word that's what Paul says he's been set free from is the condemnation that comes with desire he's saying that hasn't got a hold hold on me anymore that doesn't rule me that doesn't make me feel bad why he says because I'm walking in the spirit and when we fall we always have a way back Paul says I'm not under condemnation for anything that happens in my life now why because as a believer in sincere repentance we always have a way back to fellowship with God it's always there his grace never fails this Paul says nothing can separate us from the love of God if we'll repent amen but then he says this for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus what's that it's the law of Grace by the blood of Christ hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh what's he saying he's saying this body could never please God so don't think it's ever going to please God he says God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh in other words he puts it in the flesh and says that's not you that's just flesh he says that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he says for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit he says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace what is the greatest battle ever fought in the mind how you look at these things will help you get the Liberty from these things because if we're caught up in the carnality of this flesh we're bound but if we're caught up by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives that takes us Beyond those things then we have a liberty now he said because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God so don't try and make that a part of your Christian walk it's just dead flesh it's Fallen flesh it is failed flesh it is sinful flesh there's nothing good in it don't drag it into your relationship with God why he says but ye are oh he says so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh Hallelujah ye are not in the flesh he says but you're in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you now if any man have not the spirit of God he is none of his so there's a difference there's something that is shifted now to where he's La he's lost in this flesh it's overcoming him it's condemning him but he comes into Romans 8 and he says now I've got something that's taken me beyond that and it's the spirit that sets me above it he would say this in second Corinthians 5 he says therefore If any man be in Christ remember what he said that that uh he says um those that are in there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus then he says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature that word creature literally means creation he is a new creation amen not a made over one not just a washed one not a fixed one you are a brand new creation by the spirit amen completely new and he confirms it he says old things things are passed away passed away means dead old things are dead behold all things are become new Hallelujah that's the place we stand in tonight Church you say I can't get over this you can get over it you can get past it you can overcome it if you dwell and live in the spirit if you're filled with the spirit of God remember what brother Brandon would say he he came to this point and he says I am no longer the son of Charles and Ella brandham you know what that does church that sets you free from what Charles and Ella brandham were that sets you free from what William brandham is that sets me free from who Jonathan klette was is because I'm no longer Jonathan klette because he says I heard an eagle voice that called me beyond what this flesh held me back in and it took me to a place where the word could have preeminence in my life and I could have victory over things that my daddy couldn't and my Mommy couldn't and my brother couldn't and my sister couldn't I've got a victory that no one in my family has by the spirit that's the greatest thing I've said this so many times the last few service the greatest thing you can recognize is I am a child of God I am not a child of my parents I am a child of almighty God and His royal blood flows through my veins and I who is wretched and blind as can be can say praise God praise God I'm a child of the king amen I want to share a story as we start to close I want to show what this looks like and this is going to help the parents and this will help the young people brother Bram gives his story and I'm sorry it's a little bit long but I think it'll help us tonight he says for instance just a few days ago I was called on a scene a little something going on there was a fine young man a very fine boy he was going with a little girl he was courting her very fine little girl out of a fine family that's exactly what we want isn't it good boys going with good girls what's the problem he says and this boy all of a sudden came up with a some kind of an idea and he just walked away now brother B doesn't give us details here I if I were to guess I would say he probably committed to marrying her and then walked away that's what I think but I that's just me he did something wrong to the little girl and as much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it that's what makes me think that and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do he it just wasn't in him to do it good boy from a good family Now Catch what happens here and the father and the mother called me to the scene and saidwe would desire to know what is wrong with our boy and he says now it's not easy to do sometimes but you must be truthful and honest he's not saying he the prophet has to be it he's saying you as parents have to be truthful and honest about what's going on he says therefore the boy was a Christian as far as a Believer he had repented and had been baptized and had his position among the Believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had he says you thinking you have and having it is two very different two different things he says you might be able to try and say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many motions how much you jump run Sensations speaking in tongues shouting whatever you might lay it upon it's all right I believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it in other words unless you know what coping is those of you that have worked with with materials before a cope is when you cut two materials so that they fit perfectly together and he's saying if your testimony doesn't cope exactly with your life if what you say you believe and you are doesn't cope with what you actually are he says then there's a problem right he says because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any any tree tells what it is Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them now he's trying to tell them he's going to tell them what's wrong with their son but catch why he's willing to do it Church he's willing to do it because they say we want it straight we want the truth brother brandom we don't want our image preserved we don't just want to facade we want to bring him to a right place to a reality in God above all else they're want to know is it a spirit is it a false anointing is he under some influence what can we do how can we help is there anything we can do church that's what real parenting is lay the family pride aside and say God we need you because we're all in Fallen flesh amen they want an answer they want Liberty for their son more than they want their image preserved he says now this young fellow's parents we're talking about these things family weaknesses his mother is German no reflection on the German but there's a strain in that family and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face brother Gerald said that's what I used to do in church of course you're not supposed to talk back in church but he says that girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister I've come down the street many mornings and this young lady would be sitting out there in the yard and I'd say good morning to you and she'd just look at me and I'd stop and I'd say sure if I'm morning she'd just stand and look right at you an intelligent woman and I'd say come and up and see us sometime and she'd just stand and look he says she's got a way that she doesn't respond to things then he says well her brothers are that way father and mother's that way now the father of that boy okay so the the the mother has a strain of not responding to things they says let's talk about the daddy now the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman Moody High tempered High strong do we have any Irish people here I think we do we do listen up here you are Moody High tempered High strong we we picked on the Germans we got to pick on the Irish right he says that that's his whole family like that except one other out of the family that's converted this mother and father both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now the young man's about 17 or 18 years old something along there very fine kid and he's been a real model boy at home nice kid brother Braham has nothing to say bad about this boy and yet this boy has done something that's clearly wrong and then he says and he's got a brother that's just vice versa same family same lineage he says this boy's a good boy except for this one thing and then he's got a brother that's just a black sheep Jacob and Esau same family same parents two very different boys like Paul and Joe no right but I want you to see this he says the mother's family lives close to a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no and they they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they just won't do it it's just not in them he says now the genes and the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that's been bred out to this boy therefore the boy has a complex in him just like his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands so in other words this boy has an inherent problem in his body and he can't do a thing about it in his present condition he says now I said to the father no matter how much youve raised him up I said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks fighting shooting cutting and so forth and then now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there and won't speak very independent and so forth irreverent to religion that's a hopeless combination but I love this he says' but it's not you he says OU the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you are sweet sister Brenda kind and forgiving amen amen what does that and your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's it's your Christ that lives in you Hallelujah she still got everything in her flesh but it has become subject to the Christ that lives inside of her Hallelujah he says your whole family is like that except you why because it's your Christ that's living in you now that's why you are the way you are sister Brenda that's why you are the way you are sister Morin you look at your families my wife's the same thing look at your families and but for the great of God there go you but Christ lives in you and it sets you apart from everything that's dragging them down Hallelujah you know we tend to focus on the things that reflect our parents and our family heritage and these things what about the things that reflect the Christ that lives within us hey sometimes Satan gets things over on us but let's focus on the things that we've gotten over on satan mean let's focus on the victories that we have in our lives that reflect our heavenly father you know as I was sitting in that office something came to me and it said you know what happens so often is when we're with family we revert to family traits we ought not to do that because there's a Christ that's living in us that that family needs and what happens is we say well they understand us they know us that's the way we do it no you used to be that now you're a child of the king now you're the bride of Christ it's your testimony it's your Rising above those things that could save those ones that are still Bound by their family genetics and traits amen God help us to do that so he says to the wife says to the mother it's not you it's Christ Living in you now you're not bound by those things that are bounding your boy then I said to the father look at your family prac practically all of them are drunks and so forth I said and how moody and high tempered and high strong but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you're no more what you are in this flesh he says it's Christ in you and I said now that same thing has to happen to your son our children are not saved by Mommy and Daddy Having the Holy Ghost he says the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and water baptism in the pool said I know my son has come to Christ and I said that may be all right all the out Ward motions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he is regenerated born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in he says then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother now catch this young people listen up and yet in his intellectuality he is trying his best to overcome it don't we see that not just in our kids we see it in ourselves sometimes Amen in their intellectually they know that they ought not to do it and so they're trying to defeat it in their mind and we praise the Lord that they're fighting that they see that this is not the way they ought to be but catch what he says here he can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to over overcome it and when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God you we look at our kids inclinations at times and and we can be dismissive of it because we say well I was there and now I don't I used to be that way and now I'm not but that's not the answer for our children the answer is to teach them now because they're going to have to cope with with that until they get the Holy Ghost and the greatest way they can cope is by being taught what's right and wrong and being held to that standard of right and wrong you know it's we coddle them when they're young don't we because they're cute but here's the thing is if we cuddle it when they're young guess what happens is they grow into cuddled adults and you know what cuddled adults are useless useless cuz CU nobody's taught them how to get up pull themselves up by the bootstraps and just get down to things to get real with God to get it to get in into the path that they're supposed to be doing and so often what happens and this is we're being very honest here tonight sometimes we refuse to check their weakness because we've got the very same one that we haven't overcome amen we tell our kids you can't have screen time and then we put four hours a day on our phone we're hypocrites we've got a weakness and we're trying to tell our kids you can't do it and they're looking at us and saying but you do it and you know what they're absolutely right and so they need to see victory in us so that they know that there's victory for them as well we're not here there to discipline them into Victory we're there to show there's a way to live above these things and you can help yourself if you stay away from it but in the end the victory is not going to come through discipline it's going to come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their lives amen David struggled David the king of Israel struggled to correct his sons and we saw that Rebellion prevailed so far down his family line he struggled with Absalom and these different ones and then Solomon it got into riabal and these different ones what's the problem God gives our children God-fearing Holy Ghost filled parents and then we coddle instead of train and AD admonish God hasn't given our children Holy Ghost filled parents so that we can let them buy with everything we've got to be honest with these things that's why I share the things I do from this Pulpit so you can see hey been there struggled with it got the victory over most of it still getting the victory over some of it so you can see that there's a path there's a progression but there is a victory to be had in these sorts of things because listen if we don't teach them how to deal with these things Satan will teach them how to dwell in their weaknesses in their hurts and their pains and their excuses and it will lead them to a place where they don't even want a changing experience with Jes Jesus Christ because they've been taught it's okay to stay that way brother Braham says it this way God doesn't have any grandchildren the old Pentecostal father and mother under an experience brought you in and you just come into the church and sit there and automatically you are Pentecostal he's talking about the original Pentecost he says he doesn't have grandchildren he only has Sons and Daughters you have to pay the same price and get the same holy ghost that they did you got to be a son and a daughter not a grandson and a granddaughter he's not an old doting grandfather soft and lets his kids get by with anything bless their little hearts that's n and Pop's job isn't it not the parents he says he is God the Eternal one look at all the things brother brand mentioned about in that family drunks hot teered Moody High Strung unmoving unable to apologize unable to Humble themselves that's a hot mess of a family and we've all got it we've all got it if we go go far enough back that's a hot mass of a family and you combine two of those together and you get it even worse that's why the world is where it is is because it keeps getting worse not getting better because it's Satan's Eden and so our children come into this world and they're in a battle from the day they're born to come into that reality of being a new creation in Christ and so we've got to help them to realize that there's a battle but there's a victory and the way to that Victory is not through discipline it's through a new birth amen we have to help them fight those things by example teaching it yes by discipline but never by coddling like I said coddle children become useless adults I read in there in the office says he that spareth the rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him be times that means all the time doesn't mean we beat on our kids but it do means we correct them according to the word so they can see there's a way to live life amen as we close Paul says this know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God he's just said half of these things belonged in the lives of that mother and father of that son andul Paul comes and says now that cannot inherit the kingdom of God now catch this and such were some of you you used to be this way why because that's the way the flesh inclines itself he says but you are washed ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Amen such were some of you you look at that some of those I could say sort of I could sort of see that you know but some of those are pretty rugged one of those is the worst I could imagine and it's preeminent today and Paul had those kinds of people in the Corinthian Church and every single one of them overcame it brother says this you are a slave and if you're a Christian you're a slave you're a bondslave of the bondslave of the Lord Jesus if there's two people of you both spirit and body and if you cater to the flesh you're a slave of the devil and you'll crucify the soul that's in you for the Bible said the soul that sinth that Soul shall die and you have to crucify the Flesh in order to be a bondslave in your flesh to be a servant of Jesus Christ he said so you're a slave anyway you take it you can't get away from it amen let's stand together if we would there's only one way to overcome these natural weaknesses that's the New Birth by the Holy Ghost baptism doesn't do it confession doesn't do it it takes a dying out it takes a dying out it takes a passing away it takes a becoming a new spiritual creation a new creature in Christ and what does that do Church it puts God on the throne of your heart and it puts God in your soul it puts the Holy Ghost in in in the position in the seat of power inside of your life you know we look at what Paul just talked about and those are some horrible things to deal with and hey we all have some of those inclinations and maybe some of us partook in them before we came to the Lord in these different things you know he said there talked about a feminite that's a homosexual lifestyle people ask us these days you know where do we stand on those alternate Lifestyles and you know what our our stance on those is the same as everything else that he listed in there amen I have no problem with people saying well they can't help it they're born that way they can't I can't help being a liar I can't help being a thief or a gossiper or a glutton or any of these things they're all part of a sinful nature but Paul says such were some of you so my stance is you got to get to the point of it was you but now it ain't you and there's only one way to do it and that's the New Birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the power of God through the word cleanse them sanctify them justify them as if you never ever did it in the first place prepared you for service and then put you into service xgay people became Holy Ghost filled Christians by the Holy Ghost so when somebody says where do you stand on it I say I've got a gospel that can deliver them from that the way it delivers me from everything that I'm dealing with and guess what God looks on that the same as he does on a liar same as those that live common law same as those that are out there lying and eating McDonald's every day it's all the same to God it's all sin and every single one of us needs the exact same solution and that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to put the power of God inside to overcome all of this stuff amen they have a different struggle than I do but we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God and there's only one solution for every single one of us amen God's love is not to accept them as it is God's love will accept them as they are to change them into what they're supposed to be what love would it be that leaves them in their sinful condition unpleasing to him but we're a new creation amen we don't have to be bound by Family traits like I said I've talked about my father and his father church that cycle got broken when he gave me the Holy Ghost I've said this before you know I I remember talking to a guy one time and he tried to diagnose me with daddy issues finally my wife said I think you're barking up the wrong tree tree here cuz Jonathan doesn't have those things and this is my testimony is that when I received the Holy Ghost I knew I had a father and he was not flawed and he didn't leave me a bad inheritance he didn't leave me a a tainted will everything he left for me was pure and good and holy and I'm growing back into that image of the father that bore me truly amen Before Time Ever began amen Cycles can be broken they are being broken en in the lives of Believers today such were some of you some of us come from some pretty rough stock but yet we stand here today with the victory by God's grace by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to receive the word for our day and walk into a resurrection and a Rapture I say praise the Lord this morning amen that we've got an answer for Satan that we've got an answer for sin that we've got an answer for these bodies that it does not have to have dominion for us but we've got something that can be on the inside that can give us dominion over it amen amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord for an answer thank you Lord for a weapon Lord thank you for overcoming power Lord thank you for victory thank you for deliverance Lord thank you for Breaking Chains Lord for breaking the cycles of these families Lord of these Fallen bodies that we have Lord thankful that your mercies are new every morning thankful Lord that you are longsuffering towards us Lord that nothing can separate us from your love Lord I Thank you for the victories we have Lord the victories that we have by testimony this evening in this church Lord as we see Sons and Daughters of God being restored back to their rightful image but Lord we know it's a battle every day and we know we win sometimes and we lose sometimes and Lord we're here to get more more victories and less losses Lord we're wanting to come to the day where Satan is bound by circumstances that he can do nothing in our lives Lord I pray you lift up our faith Lord help us not to look to this flesh it's failings its sicknesses its inclinations Lord May condemnation be erased this very evening Lord but where conviction comes Lord May repentance restore us to your presence to relationship with you Lord and may we know that there's Victory and love divine Lord by the Holy Ghost Lord I pray it would bring peace this evening I pray it would bring it would Cast Away fear and bring perfect rest Lord to your bride and your children this evening each
