[54:22] back to our remembrance
[54:24] amen

[54:53] how are you believing

[54:56] looking at that's why god god wants
[54:59] the right way to believe amen he wants

[55:04] not in your head but in your heart
[55:07] oh yeah many many they just their their

[57:46] in john chapter
[57:48] 11 and verse 17
[57:52] then when jesus came
[57:54] he found that he had laying in the grave
[57:56] lazarus had laid in the grave four days
[57:59] already
[58:01] now he said bethany was nigh unto
[58:03] jerusalem about 15 furlongs
[58:06] off and many of the jews came to martha
[58:10] and mary
[58:11] to comfort them
[58:13] concerning their brother
[58:16] and then martha as soon as she heard
[58:19] that jesus was coming
[58:21] went and met him
[58:24] grace brother that we have the faith to
[58:26] meet him
[58:27] amen
[58:28] but mary sat still in the house
[58:32] and then said martha unto jesus lord if
[58:35] thou has been here my brother had not
[58:39] died
[58:41] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[58:44] will ask of god god will give it thee
[58:48] amen he was god
[58:50] amen praise the lord
[58:55] and jesus saith unto her thy brother

[59:00] and martha saith unto him i know that he
[59:03] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[59:06] the last day
[59:08] she was looking to the future
[59:10] and unfortunately too many believers are
[59:12] still looking to the future for the
[59:14] resurrection
[59:16] looking to the future for the rapture
[59:18] but brother it is in the present tense
[59:21] praise the lord
[59:23] amen she said martha said unto him i
[59:26] know that he shall rise again in the
[59:28] resurrection at the last day
[59:31] and jesus said unto her i am

[59:39] and he that believeth in me
[59:42] though he were dead
[59:44] yet shall he live

[1:23:16] from
[1:23:16] the revelation that you're a seed of god
[1:23:19] and that you come from eternity we're
[1:23:21] going back to eternity amen we're going
[1:23:24] back to a new heaven and a new earth
[1:23:27] god help us
[1:23:30] amen brother let's believe the way god
[1:23:32] wants us to believe
[1:23:35] let's believe the way that pleases god
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:40] are we going to believe like like like
[1:23:42] abel
[1:23:43] or believe like cain
[1:23:46] oh yeah well well cain that faith yo
[1:23:49] cain out of faith but not perfect faith
[1:23:52] oh yeah can't cain none of that as i
[1:23:55] preached years and years and years ago
[1:23:57] down there on empire avenue
[1:23:58] and i said which church would you would
[1:24:00] you go to cain's or abel's
[1:24:03] most would go to cain's church
[1:24:05] oh that's a nice church
[1:24:09] oh yes it was beautiful
[1:24:11] you know all that he had on the altar
[1:24:13] and everything
[1:24:14] but abel's church wasn't so good
[1:24:17] why just a
[1:24:19] why
[1:24:20] what
[1:24:21] abel never had no beautiful altar
[1:24:24] uh he just had that altar there and
[1:24:26] a lamb killed
[1:24:28] and blood all over the altar
[1:24:30] and blood overcame over abel
[1:24:34] yeah
[1:24:35] it didn't please cain
[1:24:37] but yet god said if you do what if you
[1:24:39] do what's right he said would you also
[1:24:40] be accepted but he wouldn't do it why
[1:24:42] they feel oh well this should be this
[1:24:45] should be pleasing to god look what i've
[1:24:47] done
[1:24:48] you know and so on and all that he gave
[1:24:50] all he all able give is this but look
[1:24:53] what i got there on the altar
[1:24:55] but it didn't please god
[1:24:56] he had an excellent sacrifice
[1:24:58] was that excellent yes because the bible
[1:25:01] says abel had the more excellent
[1:25:04] and if abel was more excellent keynes
[1:25:06] must have been excellent
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:10] amen
[1:25:11] so brother you can do this and you can
[1:25:13] do that and you think oh this is good
[1:25:14] this is excellent yeah
[1:25:16] but god's looking for the more excellent
[1:25:19] amen amen
[1:25:22] were you going to completely lay down
[1:25:23] your life
[1:25:25] i'll tell you this it caught it cost
[1:25:27] able his life
[1:25:29] he laid down his oh yeah the lamb laid
[1:25:31] down his life for abel and abel had to
[1:25:33] lay down his life
[1:25:35] because cain didn't wouldn't please and
[1:25:38] brother we got to lay down our lives in
[1:25:40] the eyes of the world
[1:25:42] sometimes it's
[1:25:43] not not all the time but to a certain
[1:25:45] extent with family friends and neighbors
[1:25:47] you you die
[1:25:49] you gotta lay down your life
[1:25:51] die to their influence
[1:25:53] yeah
[1:25:54] so the oh yeah it's definitely we all
[1:25:56] got to do that
[1:25:57] die to the influence of family friends
[1:25:59] and neighbors oh my lord
[1:26:02] so that we're alive to jesus
[1:26:04] we're sensitive to his leadership it's
[1:26:07] not me that lives as christ lives in me
[1:26:08] amen the lights you live what you think
[1:26:11] what you say oh my what you're doing
[1:26:14] thought word deed amen
[1:26:16] your motives and your objectives in life
[1:26:19] brother
[1:26:22] it's god in you
[1:26:25] he's controlling you now
[1:26:27] family sometimes family don't understand
[1:26:29] it
[1:26:30] it's like i said when when our family
[1:26:32] was getting together for a certain thing
[1:26:33] and a certain gathering and and so they
[1:26:36] called us called me
[1:26:39] and wanted to know
[1:26:40] wanted to know because they wanted us to
[1:26:42] be there but at the same time want to
[1:26:43] know oh gerald is is it
[1:26:46] all okay for us to do this is it okay
[1:26:49] for us to do that we just want to know
[1:26:51] before you come because we we won't do
[1:26:53] it if it's if it's
[1:26:55] contrary to anything you believe or your
[1:26:58] faith
[1:26:59] and of course at the time i said no no
[1:27:03] and it wasn't what they were they're
[1:27:05] planning on doing it it didn't didn't
[1:27:07] matter to me it wouldn't it wouldn't
[1:27:09] affect our faith for sure
[1:27:11] but again they had they were they knew
[1:27:14] because of our stand for the word that
[1:27:16] maybe
[1:27:17] they wouldn't do this maybe they
[1:27:18] wouldn't do that oh yeah
[1:27:21] because there's a stand that we were
[1:27:22] taking for the truth
[1:27:24] so brother
[1:27:26] are you leaving that impression with
[1:27:28] your family your friends and your
[1:27:29] neighbors
[1:27:30] that you're going to put them on the
[1:27:31] under under guard
[1:27:34] oh yeah
[1:27:35] even though i know that even when we
[1:27:37] lived here saint john's years ago and i
[1:27:39] was just a teenager yeah even our
[1:27:41] neighbors
[1:27:42] were sensitive to what
[1:27:44] what i believe that i was christian
[1:27:47] that i was different
[1:27:48] oh yeah
[1:27:50] they knew the difference when i would i
[1:27:51] would say i said when you would walk
[1:27:53] walk down the steps out of the house
[1:27:56] oh he's a christian he's different
[1:27:59] he's this needs that and so on oh
[1:28:02] so i pray grace brother that we have
[1:28:03] that anointing in our lives
[1:28:05] now i tell you
[1:28:07] it's going to get more and more real the
[1:28:08] closer we get to the resurrection
[1:28:11] it's going to get more and more real the
[1:28:12] closer we get to the rapture because the
[1:28:14] world's going to get so
[1:28:16] caught up
[1:28:18] with with the foolishness of the world
[1:28:20] yeah and christians are not christians
[1:28:22] like they used to be
[1:28:24] no no
[1:28:25] no not even even at one time
[1:28:27] pentecostals
[1:28:28] they knew they knew pentecostals were
[1:28:30] different but not now
[1:28:32] no no they're getting like just the rest
[1:28:34] of the rest of religion they know
[1:28:36] they're religious but when it comes to
[1:28:38] living a different life living a whole
[1:28:40] holiness and so on no
[1:28:42] not there not there like it used to be
[1:28:44] that's right
[1:28:45] grace to us
[1:28:46] amen and i tell you this even a lot of
[1:28:48] believers are not living the separated
[1:28:50] life
[1:28:51] that they used to
[1:28:54] god have mercy on us
[1:28:57] amen
[1:28:59] brother are we believing it the way god
[1:29:01] wants us to believe it
[1:29:04] giving preeminence to jesus
[1:29:06] giving preeminence to the resurrection
[1:29:08] preeminence to the rapture preeminence
[1:29:10] to what god is doing
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:15] we're not going to get scott caught up
[1:29:16] with what he did but what is he doing
[1:29:20] amen
[1:29:21] brother what he did is in the past what
[1:29:24] he's doing in the present
[1:29:25] by the grace of god
[1:29:27] what's he doing
[1:29:28] he's making us more and more one with
[1:29:30] the word and to give us more and more
[1:29:33] the faith for the resurrection the faith
[1:29:34] for the rapture amen brother he's
[1:29:37] bringing us more and more into in
[1:29:40] into his
[1:29:41] nature
[1:29:43] so that oh yeah so that we're going to
[1:29:45] get more and more
[1:29:47] uncomfortable in the world we're living
[1:29:48] in
[1:29:55] there's certain i'll tell you this
[1:29:56] there's certain worlds that maybe you
[1:29:58] could you could go to certain places and
[1:30:00] you wouldn't want to live there
[1:30:03] oh yeah
[1:30:05] there's certain things maybe that that
[1:30:06] you might be getting you might have to
[1:30:08] get to get involved in and meet out
[1:30:10] there in in the world
[1:30:13] the way people are living today and you
[1:30:15] wouldn't you wouldn't want to get
[1:30:16] involved with it
[1:30:19] no
[1:30:22] because today
[1:30:24] it doesn't matter there's very little
[1:30:25] today the sin
[1:30:29] one time this was sin that was sin this
[1:30:31] was sin they wouldn't do this they
[1:30:32] wouldn't do that or they were christians
[1:30:34] they went to church so they they then
[1:30:36] through the week they just they just
[1:30:38] lived live the christian life basic
[1:30:40] christian life
[1:30:42] but no such thing today
[1:30:44] very little and but the unfortunate
[1:30:46] thing is influencing even believers
[1:30:51] whereas
[1:30:52] one time we were spiritual
[1:30:55] we love the lord the lord loved us we
[1:30:57] lived for the lord we wanted to testify
[1:30:59] about the lord testify about what god
[1:31:00] did or we just we just loved it
[1:31:03] and
[1:31:04] it was in us that that nature was in us
[1:31:07] to
[1:31:08] to bear witness
[1:31:10] by the life we live or to family and
[1:31:12] friends and neighbors oh yeah the
[1:31:14] opportunity was there we'd say oh well
[1:31:16] thank the lord
[1:31:17] give god the glory amen god did this god
[1:31:20] did that but now
[1:31:23] no matter what what comes or goes
[1:31:26] just people are really ashamed they're
[1:31:28] almost afraid to to be spiritual or they
[1:31:31] might laugh at you
[1:31:33] or they might think you're foolish
[1:31:36] so what
[1:31:37] they want to hurt
[1:31:39] amen
[1:31:40] you don't mind burying that response
[1:31:42] very that that that rebuke and so on no
[1:31:44] you do anything for jesus
[1:31:46] considering what jesus did for you what
[1:31:49] are you going to do for him
[1:31:54] as i said it struck me here a few weeks
[1:31:56] ago
[1:31:59] i was thinking about the grace of god
[1:32:02] what what grace was
[1:32:07] i said lord
[1:32:09] i said
[1:32:10] god bless the brother that wrote it
[1:32:13] but i said he was absolutely right it
[1:32:15] was amazing grace
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:20] i said lord not just grace it was
[1:32:22] amazing and it is amazing when i
[1:32:24] consider me and my life and this brother
[1:32:27] this sister in their lives i said oh it
[1:32:30] is grace
[1:32:32] thank you jesus
[1:32:33] thank you jesus
[1:32:35] oh brother no not just considering oh
[1:32:37] god love me so he come to redeem me yeah
[1:32:39] but it was grace
[1:32:42] it was amazing grace it was absolutely
[1:32:45] unmerited favor because
[1:32:47] why because your nature was contrary to
[1:32:50] it
[1:32:50] all your hunger and thirst was contrary
[1:32:52] to it amen
[1:32:54] amen all that god wanted
[1:32:57] it there wasn't anything in you
[1:33:00] that's why oh yeah
[1:33:02] you just had to go down into your soul
[1:33:04] to see if there's any seed there
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:10] and brother
[1:33:11] get down in your soul
[1:33:13] bring a change
[1:33:15] into your spirit
[1:33:16] and into your flesh
[1:33:18] so he'll bring forth his life
[1:33:21] amen praise the lord i pray grace in the
[1:33:24] name of jesus

[1:34:07] amen
[1:34:09] grace of god
[1:34:11] deuteronomy 29 and verse 1
[1:34:16] these are the words of the covenant
[1:34:18] which the lord commanded moses to make
[1:34:20] with the children of israel
[1:34:22] in the land of moab
[1:34:24] beside the covenant which he made with
[1:34:27] them in oreb
[1:34:29] and moses called on to all israel and
[1:34:32] said unto them ye have seen
[1:34:35] all that the lord did before your eyes
[1:34:39] in the land of egypt unto pharaoh
[1:34:43] and unto all his servants and onto all
[1:34:46] his land
[1:34:47] and we have seen in this hour what god
[1:34:49] has done
[1:34:51] amen through a prophetic ministry yes
[1:34:53] sir praise the lord
[1:34:56] and it says the great temptations which
[1:34:58] thine eyes have seen the signs and those
[1:35:01] great miracles yet the lord hath not
[1:35:03] given you a heart to perceive
[1:35:06] and eyes to see ears to hear
[1:35:08] unto this day
[1:35:11] amen
[1:35:12] and verse 9
[1:35:16] keep there for the words of this
[1:35:17] covenant and do them
[1:35:20] amen
[1:35:22] that ye may prosper in all that ye do
[1:35:25] praise the lord
[1:35:27] brother is god as it were to bring
[1:35:30] israel out of egypt but brother and god
[1:35:32] to take us out of yeah brother brown
[1:35:34] also referred that we're in egypt
[1:35:37] and he said we want god to deliver us
[1:35:41] to get us out of egypt
[1:35:43] amen
[1:35:45] but my god have mercy please lord help
[1:35:47] us
[1:35:49] because
[1:35:52] are we spiritual to the extent
[1:35:54] that it's that god is wiping out
[1:35:57] the world the things of the world
[1:35:59] amen amen are we spiritual to the extent
[1:36:03] that god
[1:36:04] is bringing into us as it were a hate
[1:36:07] and we just don't like what what the
[1:36:09] world we're living in
[1:36:12] i don't like the world i'm living in
[1:36:17] do we have that anointing do we have
[1:36:18] that that experience with god
[1:36:21] our minds do we truly truly truly

[1:36:28] real true
[1:36:30] experience
[1:36:32] amen of being born

[1:36:39] so that the nature that we were born
[1:36:40] with physically
[1:36:43] is down
[1:36:45] but the new nature is up
[1:36:49] because the nature we were born with
[1:36:51] physically oh makes us more conscious of
[1:36:54] the world we're living in
[1:36:55] and we like this we like that and we're
[1:36:58] angry and thirsting for this we want
[1:37:00] this there's natural things of the world
[1:37:03] but i tell you this if you're born again

[1:37:20] and more of the world the things of the
[1:37:21] world more money more this more that
[1:37:24] brother let god control that
[1:37:27] lord whatever you want
[1:37:29] you want to make me a beggar i'll beg
[1:37:32] for for for this album and i'll do this
[1:37:34] and i'll do that i'm believing that
[1:37:35] you'll provide
[1:37:37] oh yeah but no
[1:37:39] people are are they they're figuring it
[1:37:41] out all in the natural they're living
[1:37:43] for the for the flesh
[1:37:45] oh yeah we want to want to live in the
[1:37:47] world make the flesh bit for better for
[1:37:49] the flesh better for this better for
[1:37:50] that oh yeah there's too many focusing
[1:37:53] on that
[1:37:55] how many are just going to leave it with
[1:37:56] the lord
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:00] again like i said our tent or a cottage
[1:38:02] they do care
[1:38:06] oh yeah
[1:38:09] god help us
[1:38:11] i'm not saying the lord would would have
[1:38:12] put you in a tent all the time but you
[1:38:14] if
[1:38:15] if you got that right attitude
[1:38:18] you'll give you a cottage
[1:38:21] but you've got to have right attitude do
[1:38:22] you have it because god gave it to you
[1:38:25] do you have it because god blessed you
[1:38:26] with it or do you have it because you
[1:38:28] were hungry and thirsting thirsting part
[1:38:32] god helped us
[1:38:34] oh yes there are those out there that's
[1:38:36] been blessed
[1:38:37] and they're satisfied if they don't have
[1:38:39] it again it's like that brother and
[1:38:41] sister years ago some years ago
[1:38:43] and
[1:38:45] and god came they had they had a big
[1:38:47] home and they had this and it was
[1:38:49] wonderful
[1:38:50] and
[1:38:51] god spoke to the brother in a dream and
[1:38:53] said
[1:38:55] you got to take this home and give it to
[1:38:57] the pastor
[1:38:59] what
[1:39:02] yeah you got to give it to the pastor
[1:39:04] and oh my
[1:39:06] he got up and he told his wife she said
[1:39:07] yes you're right
[1:39:10] she felt the same leadership
[1:39:12] and so that's what they did
[1:39:15] they said okay we'll do that lord
[1:39:17] oh boy
[1:39:18] and so they give it to the pastor
[1:39:21] and uh they ended up outside and then
[1:39:24] well where are we going to go now so

[1:43:04] peace though i walk in the imagination
[1:43:06] of mine heart to head drunkenness to
[1:43:09] thirst the lord will not spare him
[1:43:12] but
[1:43:13] then
[1:43:14] the anger of the lord and his jealousy
[1:43:17] shall smoke against this man and all the
[1:43:19] curses that are written in this book

[1:43:32] our spirit right
[1:43:34] this verse 29 the secret things belong
[1:43:38] unto the lord our god

[1:43:43] belong unto us and to our children
[1:43:45] forever
[1:43:46] hallelujah
[1:43:48] rather that's the word that was revealed
[1:43:49] in this hours for us and for our
[1:43:51] children
[1:43:52] amen
[1:43:53] for us in this hour it is pointing us to
[1:43:56] the resurrection and rapture
[1:43:58] that we may do all the words of this law
[1:44:02] amen let's go to another scripture in
[1:44:05] second corinthians chapter four
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:13] more willing
[1:44:17] maybe we'll
[1:44:19] have to try on sunday to
[1:44:23] to bring it to a conclusion
[1:44:25] concerning
[1:44:27] believing as god wants us to believe
[1:44:29] believe what he wants us to believe
[1:44:31] but also believe it the way he wants us
[1:44:33] to believe it
[1:44:34] and let it let it control you not you
[1:44:36] control it
[1:44:38] in second corinthians chapter four
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:49] let's start with verse 1
[1:44:51] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[1:44:53] we as we have received mercy
[1:44:56] we faint not
[1:45:00] but have renounced the hidden things
[1:45:03] of dishonesty
[1:45:06] not walking in craftiness
[1:45:09] nor handling the word of god deceitfully
[1:45:13] but by manifestation of the truth
[1:45:17] commending ourselves to every man's
[1:45:19] conscience
[1:45:20] in the sight of god
[1:45:23] amen
[1:45:24] but
[1:45:27] if our gospel be hid
[1:45:29] it is hid to them that are lost
[1:45:32] in whom the god of this world has
[1:45:34] blinded the minds of them
[1:45:37] them which believe not
[1:45:39] lest the light of the glorious gospel
[1:45:42] of christ who is the image of god should
[1:45:46] shine unto them
[1:45:48] grace
[1:45:51] oh thank god brother truly
[1:45:54] for us it is absolutely amazing grace
[1:45:59] for we preach not ourselves
[1:46:02] but christ jesus the lord
[1:46:04] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[1:46:07] sake
[1:46:09] amen
[1:46:10] for god who commanded the light to shine
[1:46:12] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[1:46:16] to give the light
[1:46:18] of the knowledge of the glory of god in
[1:46:21] the face of jesus christ
[1:46:24] amen praise the lord
[1:46:28] brother god help us to believe with a
[1:46:30] complete belief
[1:46:32] but god help us to believe as god wants
[1:46:34] us to believe giving him
[1:46:37] absolute control
[1:46:39] praise the lord is not us controlling
[1:46:43] the word or the message
[1:46:45] it's the word the message controlling us
[1:46:48] amen if we believe it the way god wants
[1:46:50] us to believe it it will control us
[1:46:53] thoughts words deeds
[1:46:56] yes our motives
[1:46:59] and our objectives
[1:47:01] amen
[1:47:02] because lord
[1:47:03] our saints our brothers and sisters by
[1:47:05] the grace of god
[1:47:08] if we're believing it the way god wants
[1:47:09] us to believe it
[1:47:11] god
[1:47:13] is
[1:47:14] in control
[1:47:16] if we're believing it the way god wants
[1:47:17] us to believe it brother sister we have
[1:47:20] god's motives and god's objectives
[1:47:23] god grace
[1:47:26] brother it's ordained to produce faith
[1:47:30] but we have to believe it if we have
[1:47:32] that faith then we believe it with the
[1:47:34] right motive and the right objective
[1:47:37] we're going to give god the glory give
[1:47:39] god the preeminence
[1:47:41] amen
[1:47:43] so lord we'll get into
[1:47:45] some thoughts here
[1:47:47] concerning
[1:47:50] believe in it the way god wants us to
[1:47:51] believe it

[1:47:55] we're the right motive and a right
[1:47:56] objective
[1:47:57] and i also want to share with you some
[1:48:00] quotes of the prophet
[1:48:02] concerning
[1:48:04] the way god wants you to do it
[1:48:06] and the way god wants you to believe the
[1:48:08] word
[1:48:09] amen god help us
[1:48:12] god hidden and god revealed simplicity

[1:49:17] be a resurrection we know there's going
[1:49:18] to be a rapture but i'll have to be
[1:49:20] honest that most believers to me are not
[1:49:22] looking for it
[1:49:24] did they just think oh it's up the road
[1:49:27] or it's going to happen when god wants
[1:49:29] it to happen no it's going to happen
[1:49:30] when you want it happening
[1:49:31] because the problem of god said
[1:49:33] that god's waiting on you
[1:49:36] and
[1:49:37] he said
[1:49:38] he said the dead in christ are waiting
[1:49:40] on us
[1:49:40] what
[1:49:42] why are they waiting on us
[1:49:44] they're waiting on us to come to that
[1:49:45] faith
[1:49:46] that'll bring them forth into glorified
[1:49:48] bodies
[1:49:50] amen
[1:49:51] praise the lord
[1:49:52] so lord help us lord please lord it's
[1:49:56] not just saying i believe the message
[1:49:57] this is the message you did this lord
[1:49:59] you did that lord yeah
[1:50:02] god said yes that's right that's right
[1:50:04] but
[1:50:05] do you have the faith that i ordained
[1:50:07] for it to give
[1:50:08] you so what do you want to do
[1:50:12] amen i tell you a lot a lot of people
[1:50:14] are just message believers and they go
[1:50:16] get baptized in the name of the lord
[1:50:17] jesus christ
[1:50:19] oh we believe this we believe that
[1:50:22] the power of god said oh yeah you can
[1:50:24] believe that he said and and go to hell
[1:50:25] you get baptized in the name of the lord
[1:50:27] jesus christ he said go to hell
[1:50:29] it was not by not by a real faith out of
[1:50:32] your heart
[1:50:33] amen that you're convicted by the holy
[1:50:35] ghost by the word of god and you love
[1:50:38] the lord and you want to do this you
[1:50:40] want to do that not just because oh well
[1:50:42] i believe that doctrine i believe this
[1:50:44] doctrine
[1:50:45] brother
[1:50:47] it's got to be based on love
[1:50:50] whether all that god did was based on
[1:50:52] his love for you
[1:50:53] now and brother why did he do this why
[1:50:55] did he do that
[1:50:56] so you would love him
[1:50:58] for it the problem of god said oh
[1:51:01] he allowed all this to happen in the
[1:51:03] garden of eden yeah all this allowed
[1:51:04] this to happen down through time
[1:51:06] amen and he came to redeem us
[1:51:09] what do you want to do
[1:51:10] he said he wanted us to love him for
[1:51:12] himself
[1:51:13] praise the lord
[1:51:15] god help us
