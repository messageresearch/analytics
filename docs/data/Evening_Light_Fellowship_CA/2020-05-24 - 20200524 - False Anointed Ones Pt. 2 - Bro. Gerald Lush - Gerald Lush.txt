and we're seeing only believe all things are possible only believed as we go through the word praise the Lord this focus our attention on the word focus our attention on the will of God for you the will of God for me a man so the grace of God with us and help us to find us in the will of God in these circumstances in these situations so let's pray every and brother I don't know if he noticed it but just recently within the last couple of days that government's had been putting the answers on churches yeah certain one said they said what this good let him go and practice their faith and pray because these if there's any time we needed prayer it's now a man they should have focused on that first one it started they met and just even this morning on the radio it was a the preacher god bless him it was good Sonia's ministry and obvious word and he was challenging them concerning pandemic and coalbed 19 and he said was this he said of God he said to God send this for a reason they got a lot of this happened for a reason and so on a man we believe that there was a reason for almost certainly brothers bringing up what's in the world but also to bring us in any in Christians to bring us in believers your attitude your spirit oh yeah God's watching us and brother now wait for us we want just to have church have Church a church but now over there the government's are focusing on churches meeting getting together expressing their faith a man and pray and there and again I don't know if you heard it on the news last night or the news again this morning whatever but that's that's what they're calling on now amen because it's gone on so long that they feel it's the time for expression of our faith amen or to allow those that have faith to go to church allow those do that faith to do this and pray for us hey man and all due respect even to the President of the United States he highlighted it he said he said we need prayer he said so he said we should allow the churches to get together and he said of pray he's because we needed a man and so what for so that they can make it there can be an expression of faith oh yeah I said well praise the Lord God allowed it to bring out what's in them what's in us he got allowed it to bring out a testimony they meant by the grace of God so got to God be the glory it's a brother that will go forth a man living out the faith manifesting the faith expressing the faith in thought in word and deed because why because we live by faith and by grace through faith were saved amen to copy the glory that must be in prayer again for those that are present here and again those that are online grace grace grace amen only Billy all things are possible from our hearts [Music] Oh oh they possible oh yes yes believe that Jesus is here let's believe that Jesus works and Jesus came [Music] praise the name of the Lord Jesus is here amen o God have mercy on his Lord Elvis to believe 19 says she's president cinema [Music] Jesus [Music] to confirm our babe on the inside of the inside a man praise the Lord [Music] yes Lord we believe what we're asked you the grace of your presence and the grace of your anointing Lord that we believe with a complete belief so then Lord we do not have any questions we have no doubt we know Lord hallelujah that in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh a man and we're so glad that the word is made flesh in us Alleluia for the moving of the Spirit with us in us yes Lord the movie - the spirit around us to preserve us and to protect us in order to give us power over the world and to give us power over the flesh and power over the devil for the glory of God that in all things Lord that you would have the preeminence in our in our souls in our bodies in our spirits all for the glory of God and Alba's Lord in the name of Jesus Alleluia by the grace of God to take our stand for the truth to take our stand for the word to take our stand Lord even for the prophecy concerning the hour that we're living so Lord be with us I pray each brother each history son and daughter of God for the glory of God Lord I pray for the anointing of your life I pray for the noni Lord on the life of your blood Lord in us with around us nor we need the anointing because Lord without it we can do nothing but with it all things are possible because Lord is not me then it's you it's not my brothers and sisters nor does Christ in the Father it's your own ideas your power praise the name of the Lord Alleluia so the grace of God as we let go Lord and then God is way they go and they Godfather do what you want to do say what you want to say so loyal that you're in control of the ministry that you're in control of those that are hearing the Word of God and I know yet well truly we need to have you in control truly we need Lord and you the filter at all a man so that it all God that it gives us the faith that pleases you praise the name of the Lord so Lord into your hands we commit ourselves Lord the Saints that have gathered the Saints that are watching online grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ father to have faith a man to believe with all of our hearts knowing Lord that we know all of this Lord is a sign of the absolute end of all things it is the end of the world so in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that will go for there's the seed of God believing it looking father for what you promised to do in these last days nor praying grace that you'll do it in us with us and through us so grace to us oh god we pray for your glory your honor your praise amen race or that in the life we lived it is for your glory your honor your praise a man not just reflecting our Lord our faith not just reflecting Lord what we think we believe my lord reflecting the life of God a man believing Lord that you are made flesh in the bright grace grace grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God amen and man today man lord I believe [Music] Oh things are watch him oh lord I lord be a man praise the Lord Lord [Music] Oh flames are possible Lord I aim at praise the Lord turn with me to second Corinthians chapter 11 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 a man and praying the grace of God to be with us today and to help us was he go through the word Amen so that the will of God be done and that we'll say what he wants us to say and the saints of God will hear what God wants them to hear a man in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 10 as the truth of Christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of a Kia wherefore he said because I love you not he said God knoweth Paul's faith and Paul's ministry and Paul's calling was being challenged but he said what I do that I will do that I may cast off vocation he said from them which desire location he said that we're in they glory he said they may be found even as we are and he said for such because they're seeking to glorify themselves they're seeking to highlight themselves and he said for such are false apostles and they are deceitful workers a man transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ amazing and again to highlight the revelation concerning the anointing once at the end time and I trust by grace that we're going to get the right revelation of the anointing ones at the entire then we're going to believe it the way that the Bible teaches it we're going to believe in the way that God has highlighted it in these last days and as I say just before God called the Prophet home he laid this on his heart to share with the saints concerning the endtime anointed ones so that we're not going to be deceived by the false once and again to understand as I mentioned I believe on Wednesday that is not a false anointing no no it is a true anointing but they're false in their teaching a man so bright pray God brothers sister that weird that we got the true anointing that's good but let us not be false in our in our teaching there does not be false in what we say that we believe there's not be false you know that we're going to reflect the Word of God and we're going to afflict it exactly according to the prophecy according to what God has ordained for this hour but we are dealing with those that are false apostles here as as Paul dealt with them in the first stage we deal with them in these last days for such he said are false apostles and deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ this is amazing and it says that no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel light a man make sure that we're following the right light by the grace of God and therefore he said it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works God's grace to ask god bless you may be seated amen and it is God's permissive will there are those that would wonder why after the prophet has said what he has said after God has revealed to us what he has revealed to us in 19 and 65 why would God permit false Christ's why would God permit the false prophets and yet they would be experiencing his anointing but yet false in their teachings so I believe that God had a reason in permitting it God permitted it in the Garden of Eden God is permitting it in these last days in Satan's Eden a man God is permitted in this hour where in the Bible it's already expressed to us that it is the God Satan is the god of this evil age a mad so brother/sister we we need to be on our guard again let me repeat it if there's ever an hour that we need to make our calling and election sure it's this hour a man to know who you are to know a man that you are in the right word that you're under the right anointing by the grace of God but also they are under the right teaching because there are those are under or under a right anointing but as under a false teaching Amen that's the truth and yet God allows as God permits it for a reason and the proud of God brings this out he feels that it's very very important and he feels that that we needed in these last days and I Andy's friend he's right brother God God - we just got allowed us to go through it you know all other ages and God just we skipped over skipped over God God just made man God's permissive will but in the last stage when God is requiring a greater faith God gives us the greater revelation of false Christ's and false prophets a man so they've been in they've been with they've been I've really in in in the history and in in what God has done and what God is doing the false prophets have been there right from the beginning a man and brother not only when it comes to a time but also in eternity because it says Satan walked up and down in the coals of fire Satan was a covering chair a mayor and and the Bible tells us Eddie where everything was fine until iniquity was found in him until he got lifted up with pride he met and that's the truth praise the name of the lord thank you lord Alleluia as saying God lifted up with pride and he was cast out and I and those angels that win with him Amen they were cast out so brother now we know that that we were dealing with those strange spirits among believers amen Satan is not going to be out there just wandering among the unbelievers no he already got them he got he don't have to worry with that a man they're all they're already lost they're already their names and on the Lamb's Book of Life but where Satan is going to work he's going to work among believers a man right from the Garden of Eden and row well even he turned to yourself he was where among the angels of God in eternity a man he was working among the seed of God in the book in the in Genesis and in the Garden of Eden and brother the the Saints the Saints and the prophets have had to deal with those false spirits right from right through the new Old Testament right on in through the New Testament a man and right on down to the east last days a man and the prophet of God does bring it out a man you bring out concerning Moses but are you bringing out concerning the those that were impersonating Moses he'll bring out concerning the true prophets and those that were impersonating the true prophets a man and only that there there there there's evidence right here in the scripture that God did use some of those false prophets a man and God didn't own some of those false prophets they met there is there is a false prophet right here in the Old Testament and brother o mine oh yeah he would go out and he would say to Israel and he would say to this nation that nation the Lord told me this and he was right God did tell him a man but he would apply his own thoughts to other things he wouldn't go out an ant applied a word he wouldn't want to say now stay with this word stay with this word he was saying that the Lord said this but a man he was a goat not a lamb he was a goat not a sheep and so it said that's what the false prophets yay and God said thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord but then they're put in their butts then they'll add this and they'll add that and you know they say oh yeah you can do this you can do that but God said this and so on so brother the false anointed ones in these last days is not it's not just in the last days they've been God has been dealing with them from eternity the saints of God have been dealing with them all the way down through time and now it's coming to a climax and you and I have to deal with those false anointings falselist spirits rather again you can have a true anointing but a false teaching oh yeah you can experience as I said again let me repeat it that you can experience the anointing of God and the Holy Ghost in your flesh 24 hours the prophecy and go to hell a mayor because why it's in your flesh not in your heart is your flesh govern man controlled by the thoughts of your mind but not by the revelation in the heart God is in the heart Satan is in the mind and again this is this is the devil's watchtower is your mind and God's watchtower is your soul if he is in your soul a man if you are truly mourned again praise the name of the Lord see listen in the German are we needed it is in this hour but I down through the ages people just believe all I got to do is believe God's prophet I believe God Lord forgive me and so on and move on a man they laid down their lives and they went into the dimension of the righteous and so on but as time moved on moved on moved on it was becoming more and more and more deceiving with these false prophets a man oh yeah we're coming were under a greater and greater anointing a man but yet a greater and a greater and I'm false teaching a man Jesus experienced that 2,000 years ago now mrs. Jesus Christ has experienced it Jesus had to deal with Judas now we're dealing with the Judas Terrance the prophet of God said pretended brothers amen I'm not worried about those out there it says what we're going to experience around the message amen let's make our calling and our election sure and next more than a yes make sure we got the anointing yes right but make sure that anointing is going to line us up with the Word of God that which is pleased was good there really than which I need right now what does I need to know what does I need to believe amen what is the faith I I need to have right now is it just a faith to believe that God has sent a prophet is just a faith to believe that God has opened the seven seals and the mystery of God is revealed brother we need to believe something more than that amen there are many that are believing God us and a prophet God has opened the seven seals the mystery of God is finished and so on but yet they're still going on living the same kind of a life a man but brother if we really truly got the revelation as we ought to have it and we truly got the anointing iniesta God the anointing but got a true teaching and that we're under the Word of God that is ordained predestinated to give us what God has ordained for it to do and brother brother says when it comes to the mystery when it comes to the seals when it comes to the Prophet what is it ordained to do why did God - for prophesied this and ordained this to heaven to give the bride what she needs in this hour they gave other what he needed in that day and Wesley what he needed in that day a man they didn't mean while you and I need amen you and I need what they had plus a mate and to give the Pentecostals why they needed a man but brother now is giving us that plus a man and what is the plus or God sent a prophet the mystery of God is revealed the seals are open yeah that's right but brother as it accomplished in you what God wants it to accomplish is it is it doing to us what God wants it to do is it giving us what God wants it to give a man not just the revelation of the mystery not just a revelation of the seals not just a revelation of this rather this doctrine that doctrine amai it what is all of that ordained to do it's why brother sister why did God do that because faith comes by hearing the word a man the word is there I heard the word but did we catch the faith a man that's the thing that many many have heard the word but haven't they haven't got the faith that's the truth of a man god help us brother and the prophet of God was dealing with that even before God called him home a man that's why that he went on and he ministered on the anointing once at the end time he ministered on leadership and he ministered on a man the rapture and then he ministered on perfect faith perfect faith one of the one of the last messages that he ministered on and it was perfect faith why because knowing that what God has done and what God was doing it was to give us faith that pleases God and without faith it is impossible to please God amen and we got to have that faith that God wants us to have in the day in the hour that we are living a man God Elvis brother that we are here now because gods because God has sent a prophet we're here because God through the prophet revealed the word a man and in that word is what I need in that word is what you need in that word is what God wants us to have and to get and it is rapturing faith it is to pay for the Resurrection and the pay for the rapture amen brother Jesus came with a brother hallelujah brother than any of the prophets that come on the scene and to have that revelation Jesus at it he had the revelation of the resurrection and he had the revelation of the rapture a man and and brother not only that but he had the revelation where he come from why he was here and where he was going and now he's going to get there amen praise the name of the Lord all my grace mothers not just saying I believe in God and I believe this and I believe that no you gotta believe what God wants you to believe in this late hour a man so brother sister that were not going to be deceived by the false anointed once a mate oh yeah they got an anointing they can do signs and wonders they can do this they can do that but and then then they'll take the message but then what they'll do is they'll they'll just go so far and they'll add to it or take away from it a man and there's many there's many a so-called ministry today brother again false Christ's they become false prophets a man because we're going to say yes God said but a man as it was in the Garden of Eden so it is right now and as even and Adam had to deal with that so you and I have to deal with that brother we'd be better be careful of the buts amen so a man so they're not going to say yeah the Provost said but the robber said but no no it is thus saith the Lord it is written a man and as the prophet of God said I got to get myself out of the way and he said so he can do this I'll give my son another way so he not only not only in in the signs and the wonders but brother get himself out of the way for the going forth of the word a man and again as the ministry and brethren and as our brother prayed that the minister and the pastors and the evangelists and all the fivefold ministry they had to get themselves out of the way a man so God can say what he wants to say a man and what he wants to say is ordained to give us the faith that he wants us to have a man again going beyond the faith that God sent a prophet going beyond the faith that it is the last days going beyond the faith a man that the seals are opened a man and this God has done this God has done that brother-sister a man let's go beyond that to to what God has done it for the reason he did it a man that we can say the way God did this why God did that hey I he's doing it in me he's doing it in you a man he's producing in you he's producing it in me by the grace of God Amen because there are many even in the days of Luther brother they never got justification the way that God wanted them to get it amen and that's why that why their roles that generation they got the intellectual knowledge and revelation of justification but they never had the spiritual revelation in their souls a man and what do they do they went out and they made a denomination out of it amen oh yeah this is this is in the Bible they did they went back to the Bible and they say where the Bible says this the just shall live by faith and so on this is it right here and our founder Martin Luther was right he said this and he said that but yet for Martin Luther it wasn't a doctrine it was it was an experience amen he experienced justification as well as the Wesley experience sanctification and the Pentecostals experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just the doctrine to say I believe this and I believe that they experience it and they lived it amen Martin Luther experienced join us straight to the justification and he lived it they praise the Lord and John Wesley experienced that he lived it a man and he went but it wasn't just a doctrine it was the life because anything they were looking for it was the faith that please God amen well there there this in their heads that in their heads but they were looking for an experience in their souls with God know one experience with God Wesley one experience with God the Pentecostals were looking for an experience with God a man Lloyd like Luther had and Wesley had but they wanted a greater experience with God a man the one Luther had plus but Wesley had plus what God was going to give the Pentecostals and now they that's there for you and me as well but we want that plus a man don't think you're gonna you got to do away with it not by any means because again God still requires justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen praise the name of the Lord the public God's are the gifts are there there and wave any big God wants to use them they're there a man we're not gonna leave them we're not going to lay them aside not by any means we're just live we just go on in the spirit amen thank you lord i justified amen you have the experience of justification you know the experience of sanctification amen that you have the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost amen and giving you access to the gifts praise the name of the lord is between yes bringing us closer and closer and closer to God a man more in the fellowship with God more in the fellowship with with our Lord Jesus Christ a man by getting us closer and closer to the resurrection and the rapture a man so God did that God did that well what's the next thing it's resurrection and rapture amen but too many or too many areas going to Malachi for they stop there yeah they stop in Malachi for I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he should turn to her the father's to the children now John went that was John the Baptist a man he turned the heart of the Jewish fathers and the Old Testament fathers to the New Testament children a man but and Jesus told him when they said well where's Elijah well he's already come and they didn't know it referring to John any any of the dreams doing what he was ordained to do to turn the hearts of those those Jewish fathers the Old Testament fathers to the New Testament children a man but he said he but he said he's going to come and he prophesied they reference the time that I had that the spirit of Elijah would come again and restore all things a man knowing that there was going to be a doing away with a lot doing away with a lot a man but God said I'll restore a million and he said this the second time that Elijah was going to come and he said he o ne and the heart say you turned the heart of the father's to the children and the last time he said the children to their fathers what is now it's the children now to turn our hearts back to the Pentecostal father's praise the name of the Lord hallelujah why because they had gotten off into coal religion and denominational religion and so on a man and oh yeah they they believe this they believe that and they added in their heads but not in their hearts amen because if you got it in your heart Amen Lutheran and it is art and those that lived in Luther's day had it in their hearts and they went on to Wesley and then they had that in their heart so they went on to the Pentecostals and they got it in their hearts ain't man and those are the ones that come right on to the message amen if you guide the baptism in your heart justification sanctification the bedroom of the Holy Ghost in your heart in your soul you'll go right on to the reprobate you'll go on to the greater revelation of the resurrection and the rapture and our hearts are turned back amen to the revelation of the word to give us the faith of the Resurrection the faith of the rapture why because 2,000 years ago Jesus and Old Testament Saints were resurrected and raptured a man praise the name of the Lord hallelujah he had that faith to lay down his life pick it up again a man and the boy got faith lay down your life pick it up again a man the resurrection and the rapture if there's anything that God is wanting us to focus on is resurrection and the rapture getting us out of here amen amen that's the closing of the Gentile dispensation and the moving of the gospel back to the Jews amen for the hundred and forty-four thousand it is the end of all things brother I pray God help us to believe that it is and not only just to believe that it is let us go to live like it is that we literally live what we believe any man and so that it's not just in our end you're gonna have it in your head but you won't live in it live like it porno there's too many believers God got all that in their head but they're not littered it's not in their hearts how do you know because they're not living it no no they're not acting like it's the end of the world and they're not many many a billion so-called believer they're not doing as Jesus told them to do and the problem does bring it out again in the message then only once at the end time and he said Jesus did this Jesus did that he said this he said that before he's no no you should look up because your Redemption draws nigh amen brother if there's anything anything when it comes to results of what God has done in Malachi 4 where God has done in Revelation 10 brother I tell you though those that are come under the revelation of those prophecies fulfilled in this hour they're the ones that's looking up amen they're not caught up with this world that not caught up with the flourishes of this world they're saying goodbye amen we're on our way amen and brother we want to we want to get out of you got the Holy Ghost you want to get out look a little Luther hungered and thirsted and crying for the revelation of jobs justification and Wesley cried for Saint a vacation and I'll tell you the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts amen there's a generation of Pentecostals they were crying crying crying for the moving of the Spirit of God a man and the restoration of the gifts a man so brothers sister there's going to be a generation that's going to be hungry and thirsting and cried for the rapture hungry and thirsty no crying for the resurrection not just lazy oh yeah they're due this is a lazy generation and brothers naturally and they're lazy spiritually why do you want me to do oh yeah brother like Jesus when he was in the Garden of Gethsemane and he went and did he with everyday was just laying there didn't they weren't bothered oh he will sleep on sleep on take your rest because the hour is coming in when when they when they would do it a man when they would get into the revelation gave the Holy Ghost and they would have the power of the anointing amen that Jesus had a man through that Peter when they when they went to crucify Peter further for the faith after the day of pedicle at the penny kind of the bed the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and the revival a man and Peter winona and he took his stand for the truth he took a stand for the word amen praise the name of the Lord and you man Peter and then when they were there were they took him put him in prison they're going to crucify you and they did but they were a Christian five minutes they crucified Jesus Peter said don't do that he said I'm not worthy he said turn me upside down yeah so they turned him upside down on the cross and crucified Him amen why he felt he wasn't worthy but he wanted to die for the gospel see Jesus died and laid down his life but again let's understand this Jesus had a revelation of where he come from where he's but where he was going why was here how he's going to get there brother now God true the message of the earth in this hour in these last days God has given us a revelation of where we come from why we're here where we're going and how we're going to get there amen and we recognize Malachi 4 because God has through Malachi 4 give us what it's going to take to get us home amen and not only to get us not to just to give us what we need to get us home to give us the revelation that we need to what forth to get us to look up because if we're going home you gotta look up praise the Lord as I I prayed nice and Lord I said pray grace grace that Lord that will had the same attitude that you had 2,000 years ago a man because he knew that hour was coming he couldn't take it no longer how much longer he said shall I be with you I turns not many believers with that attitude and if you don't have that attitude you're not gonna know rapture you got to have that attitude in that spirit to go into rapture you got a walk to go amen that's again as their Bible of God said that's why God is waiting on us why through the revelation of the word and the going forth of the word nain in the word a man receiving the word because we sieve it in our hearts it's going to give us that desire amen the more and more we believe the message the more and more we're getting into the word amen the more and more we're going to be looking up we'll ignore what's going on in the world get thee behind me Satan in red Satan can try to get you to focus on that too why because he wants to keep you away from the rapture keep you away from the resurrection he knows his time is short amen and he knows the significance of the Resurrection in the rapture he knows that's it oh my I'm really finished when they go in the resurrection they go in the rapture I'll be really finished well I'll do this and I'll do that but he knows his time is over he knows his time is short amen so brother sister are we living with this this this revelation of what God has done why he has done it a man as God accomplished in us what are you nor deigned amen to a communist what he wanted to accomplish in us through Malachi 4 through the Ministry of William Branham amen through the signs and the wonders true they owe me the word Amen God did it that's good I believe God did I believe God did it by school yeah the devil believes he did it amen but is it accomplishing in you what are you ordained for hate to accomplish in us just to get us to believe it no no get us to receive it and live it amen so why so that what God did is controlling you the mystery the open seals is controlling you amen controlling what you think how you think what you do and how you do it amen so the brother we're not living for ourselves we're living for the Lord when I live in where ourselves were living for the resurrection to wrassle we can't get away from it Amen Jesus couldn't get away from it he was thinking about it praying about it oh my he's just looking up looking up and he oh I know I'm going to Jerusalem and the Son of Man is gonna be betrayed into the hands of sinful men old Peters no no no no no no we won't go he said get behind me Satan what why would he say that because the devil was there to try to prevent it Satan knew that what Jesus were going to accomplish in calvert at Jerusalem was going to give him a greater and a greater defeat a man knowing that it was going to it was going to give Alleluia the seed of God more and more power over the devil a man praise the name of the Lord and that's why the devil didn't want Jesus to get down there a man my brother oh my I can't good it can't get him do it now to explain all that but it's tremendous God has ordained that God predestinated this and this this and he said out of my way I gotta go to Jerusalem he knew that he knew the price you had to pay and after he had prayed and the angel came and strengthened the physical body go amen on the accuser of this and the accused with that and he could have answered but he didn't he opened not his mouth Amen why why do you say sorry because just consider what he said he said what if I could call to ask the Father and he have sent me 10 legions of angels to destroy the world and set me free amen oh we want God to set us free no no we're going to endure unto the end hey man we got to endure what's going on into the world we got to endure any man well the devil is doing amen we're pressing on get behind me Satan amen Oh what you're gonna put up with more of this yes we're gonna do endure more of this we're gonna suffer more of this amen he suffered we're gonna suffer amen but the end of his suffering was amen resurrection and rapture praise the name of the Lord Alleluia as the part of the God said God's gonna let us stay longer you know and we'll experience the lap over into the end of the Great Tribulation amen and he's gonna let the bride stay a little lawyer for his trial of her faith to see you bring out bring out bring out what he brought out of Jesus and gets a man that he's gonna bring it out of you and me as the Bride of Christ or entice everybody praise the name of the Lord is God seen that faith in you amen you are laying down your light you're making sacrifice after sacrifice for the word for the message you're making sacrifice after sacrifice for the break for your brothers and sisters in Christ amen we're fighting for one another amen it's just again anyway Twitter some time ago it's like that like that so it's soldier and he was training other soldiers he was an officer in the army and I think it was in England or they were British soldiers and they were being trained during the four orderings like war war or before it and all he sent the soldiers in you know and do this do this do this now and and he he said you got to fight your way through this and come up with air and oh yeah they went in went in went in went in and they came and he was over there and this soldier came out alone he said how long he said anybody else oh yes he said they're in there he said you get back in and he said don't you come out until you're there to help somebody else out amen oh yeah dig it they had to be it there to be concern for one another amen they had to be there to defend one another to fight for one another amen and then as it was during the Second World War and there and those issues go on right now even even in Israel and God bless Israel a man that there are soldiers that are there fighting for one another and there are soldiers that lay down their lives for others oh yeah they'll let let them kill kill them and save their life of their friend any of us is gonna lay down our lives for somebody else stop living for yourself just live for Jesus live for Jesus you're living for your brothers and sisters you're there to encourage them and get there to strengthen them come on we're almost home we're almost home brother hey man praise the Lord just keep looking on a man the strong supports the weak that's Scripture that's Bible that's right praise the Lord I was reading one time and I went in and studied at the studied I was Oh Lord that's amazing amen and why would you allow I said why would you allow the weak to be a part of the bride what would you love the weak to be a part of the calling well it's to bring out what's in the strong is to make manifest to spirit descend this one and that one the strong is to support the weak see God got a reason for water BRE permits he got a reason for a million God's in control and brother he allows this and he allows that a man he said ever and that I allowed he said good and I never allowed evil yes to bring it what's in the good that's there to try us to encourage us to strengthen our faith by the grace of God oh my this is tremendous god help us God give us a right spirit and a right anointing amen sure that we're not living for our cell we're not living for a religion we're living for Jesus we're living for the resurrection were living for the rapture we're living with a kingdom of God and I prayed and I said Lord on my lord I said this is gonna be glorious when we can get out of here and I said we're going to get into a kingdom I said where there won't be any darkness all night there won't be any negative thoughts all positive there won't be nothing of sad no snow remembrance it's gone into the sea of forgetfulness amen we're going into the kingdom of God I said hey may and indane the glorified bodies where I said the devil will have known it no use for the devil to come because there'd be nothing different attempt us in the glorified body to God be the glory a body llegando is glorified a glorious body amen God Elvis brother that we're going to have the right anointing right true anointing but let's make sure we got the right teaching why do you know idea is one thing the teaching is another what does teaching do gives us faith oh the inany gives us faith no the anointing gives us the word to give us faith faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word Amen praise the Lord and Brotherhood the enemy is there any to to influence God's anointed ones a mentor yeah they got the anointing but he'll influence them to give up false teaching to add to what God said yeah if God said but yes God said but brother not only the search the serpent in the Garden of Eden and not only Eve to it - to Adam a man my brother he's influencing preachers and and the laity a man oh yeah God sent a prophet God sent a prophet cause to the problem he said this and then he opposed but in are you still doing it many a preacher as said this but and and added this and that a day they'll say it this way they say it that way brother sister be careful leave it the way that it is know whether the popular God said after the Oh me of the seven seals now he said don't make it any bigger than what it is don't make it any smaller than what it is he said leave it the way it is a man but I tell you this since they're going to the Prophet they have made it bigger than what it is smaller than what it is a man they did they're not leaving it the way that he said it a man they'll say it this way they'll say it that way they'll add true it take away from it and so on brother that's called what is it they got a date there der noted with the Holy Ghost to recognize that it was God not anybody the Holy Ghost to recognize there was a prophetic ministry a man it was the only the word the revelation of the mystery of God but the debt the enemy comes in to influence them in their thinking concerning what the prophet said a man the same as they there to influence many when it comes to reading the Bible yeah he's there to influence their thinking because brother instead of reading it from the heart they're reading it from their heads oh god help us they're satisfied with that kind of an experience oh yeah they feel that's all right I believe God and I believe this and I believe that so praise the Lord thank you Lord for what you did yeah what are they gonna do what are we gonna do are we gonna do what God wants us to do amen or just just stay with the letter of the word you know not get into the spiritual revelation of it that's gonna live it live itself out in you and me if God is living the word out through you and me a man living it out and it can brother sister listen oh yeah but the sisters got long here and they they got this clothes and all that and the brothers got this and the mothers got that yeah I know but the devil is impersonating yeah he got that too but the thing of it is God requires more than that or they give you that faith for that give you that faith but what about rap free faith what about resurrection faith are you focusing on that many focus on honor their hair and their clothing and and all in this and that but what about focusing on what God wants us to focus on the resurrection and the rapture again as I said they're going into this doctor and then that doctrine where they getting into the faith that pleases God God wants that gift sure well you can add that and go to hell sisters gonna have long hair and long clothes and go to hell her brother can be dressed decently and modestly err monastery and go to hell if he's not getting into the truth and manifesting the faith that God is looking for for the resurrection and the rapture if there's any were faith that Jesus had to come forth with the manifest was resurrection and rapture what lay his life down pick it up again I knowing that to rice with the truth the saints of God he will see when he laid his life down he knew where he was going yeah he had to go down and and and talk to the devil and defeat the devil to take the keys of hell and of death and he went over to the Saints they were they were in in in that place there and the Old Testament Saints that believed the Word of God in their day and come on now he opened the door let him out come on we're going and when he rose they rules and they went into the city and appeared unto many well when the dead in Christ rise now they're going to go in and appear to the bride the bride occurred about the power of God said in any one of his messages he said they're going to come to us and then he said we'll recognize him no know who they are and we'll be will go into a glory theophany body and then you do a 45 body and then he said we look up and there's Jesus and we rise to meet him and I believe somewhere he said that when we meet the Old Testament Saints or nay the New Testament Saints rather that are gone on when we need them he said we're going to have fellowship with him and I believe he mentioned somewhere that we left fellowship for around 30 we won't be in time but he said around 30 or 40 days that's what will seem like in time and he said well fellowship one other in that dimension hallelujah and then he said we'll look up and there he is amen he comes down to get us into that dimension then he goes back up into the int into the body that's at the right hand of the throne of God the body that he used to redeem us in and he gets into that body again because right now as I said where is that body called Jesus it's not here it's up it's next to the throne of God there's no life in it he used that body he gave what he did he went up and raptured in that body and he put it on under the side of the throne of God amen as a token evidence that the price was paid amen and then on the day of Pentecost he came back down in the form of the Holy Ghost amen but now he's going back up again and he's going to go into that body how do you you and after the resurrection rapture he'll come down and will rise to meet him praise the Lord how did oh yeah amen this believe that Jesus is here with us and he's in us grace of God God elders to believe brothers sister let's not be deceived in the teaching that God has given us these are the false Christ's these are the false prophets he said the hair got the true genuine anointing but he said they got false teaching he said they'll go off here and go off there and brother he brings it out he down through the Old Testament and into the New Testament he brings it out Moses was the true and then they were and then there was another one under the same anointing but false teaching then he brings out this one amen and we'll we'll highlight those for you eventually a man and and he brings out this one yeah you that was that was a servant of God anointed by the God but then there was also another one right here oh yeah he was under the anointing - but his teaching was false huh he might have said the Lord said this the Lord said that but he'll permit him to go do this yeah so brother will bring that out too and again it's God it's not the devil it was God Satan Satan and influenced them in their teaching and there's many a preacher today under there under the anointing of Malachi 4 and what God has done what God is doing well the enemy is they'll go so far with the word and the message yeah but then God wants us to keep on going to the place where it will give us faith give us resurrection fade wrap through faith but the enemy is there to stop us demons they're not to put the emphasis on that a man to make you content with this world dietarily brother if God is there he's laying in the worst you're not satisfied with this world a man he's laying the word so that you're focusing on the the world to come you're focusing on the kingdom of God and brother I'll be honest I'm hungry for the king no God I want to get out of here that's the truth why in the world what I want to stay here much longer for oh well I'll do this I'll do this I'll enjoy this no but I want to get out of here into the kingdom of God with our Lord Jesus Christ how many really want to see him I really want or even do as the Prophet says go up to what climb or crawl up to his feet and put your hands on his feet how many got that revelation of Jesus how many how real is the revelation of Jesus to us a me or is he just an historical yeah oh that's an historical figure there that our brother painted Oh oh yeah the Bible talks about Jesus the Bible says this yeah he says he rose again and he ascended and so on but not knowing the plan purpose pattern of God oh my that preacher and though he was a denominational preacher this morning on the radio he was bringing out God's plan yeah why did God allow this why did God do this why is God doing that he said it's a reason yeah and I believe he knew that it was to bring up what CNES seed what city's children yeah you bring it out cuz ernie seed oh yeah he's preaching he was preaching on that but the farmer that went forth sowing seed yeah he said see if sowing this seed sowing that seed and he said this happened to that seed that happened to that that happened that seed yeah why he said because of the circumstances surrounding it and they allowed this and they allowed that you allow this and so on this is going down that's going down but he said then there's the true seed or the true seed all right but he said is he everything around it is good the soil is good the moisture is good hey man yeah he said and it's gonna break all the rest break he said but not it won't produce the fruit yeah it's a seeded producing the fruit in you amen what fruit is are producing you now I just bring you out a denomination no no is to bring forth a greater and a greater and a greater fro to take his home yeah but going back where we come from praise the Lord again the public God brings out and assured this message here another message he only had this one yeah when he was talking about the fault dr9 ones at the end time the anointed ones true nineteen's the some got the right teaching others got the false and he brings it out about the tree that a that a brother shoulder man showed him oh yeah it was a tree and it had all kinds of fruit on it and he said to the man he said what kind of a tree is that he said it's an orange tree Orange he said where did all this fruit come from your lemons there's grapefruit there was this there was that always said that's grafted in Oh grafted in yes he said but he said if it brings forth a new branch it'll bring forth oranges he said that's right he said because it's its original folks he didn't think of it is and I've drawn here on the board some long time ago and what concerning the tree of life of good and evil and and the tree of knowledge of good and evil on tree of life so brother what tree we know well God planted the tree of life amen but the enemy came in and started to graft in this graft in that graft in this but where are they getting the life they're getting the life from the tree the original tree the orange tree so the enemy grabs this see and grasped that in when it comes to down through the ages and religion and so on and in oh yeah and they're getting the life from the same way we're getting the life hallelujah I don't know it the life that's reproducing Christ in us amen it is positive giving us the faith that pleases God but but that's it like they're Doya they're getting the same life but they're producing the wrong fruit amen it's not the fruit of the original tree now I tell you if we're a part of the original tree we're going to produce the fruit of it because the Bible tells us by their fruit are they known you see there are false prophets there are true prophets false apostles true apostles and he said but they're known by their fruit amen praise the Lord I tell you brother would their same anointing I'm gonna say no any ones at the end time they got we all got the same anointing but we're bringing forth this fruit and they're bringing forth different hallelujah the Prophet was bringing it out again in the message see he said so he said what fruit are you bringing out are you bringing out the fruit well look what Luther bought it oh that's from the original tree wonderful well Wesley brother that was from the original tree but then after that the enemy began to graft in this graft in that and it looked like Luther's church look like Wesley shirt look like the Pentecostal but it's something not different not not that it's different about it yeah it was something the enemy grafted in oh yeah and it's joined life from the same tree ho glory they're drawing life for the same tree that the bride is drawing life from but they're not producing the same fruit grace to us they see turn with me to Matthew 7 oh my I almost been an hour Matthew chapter 7 and verse 13 and he says enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and to there be that find it beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing yea look like sheep he said but inwardly they are ravening wolves they got the spirit of a wolf not the spirit of a lamb oh yea that's their attitude and there's a lot of believers got this got the attitude of a wolf not many got the attitude of the of the Lamb of God or the spirit of a sheep they're different oh yeah why she sheep got to be led and she looks for leaders yeah but wolves they're not interested in a leader no so beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves that's their attitude spirit ye shall know them by their fruits amen see were they grafted into the tree are they part of the original tree many are grafted in and by their fruits you know well that's not bright they're grafted in but they're identified as bright they want to believe they're bright identifying with the message identifying with the revealed word oh yeah but they're not bright why by their fruits you'll know them by their spirit and their attitude you know them by their actions and reactions you know oh they don't have a simple they don't have a humble spirit like Jesus a Jesus always said he could have called ten thousand angels destroyed the world set him free well he could have called just one angel to help him he could have called this one and he could have done that to Pilate or Pharaoh or the leader or there are the Jews the read the scribes and the Pharisees no he didn't do it why because he loved you it was his love for you that he endured just thing it wasn't him wasn't it sin no he bore your sins and mine he was perfect thank God for his love he said you shall know them by their fruits well what's the fruit of the anointing of a true son of God he gonna have the true teaching of God by the Word of God to give us the faith that pleases God and if and if it's a false anointed one he got the writ he got the anointing but a false teaching that's true anointing but a false teaching you know you should know them by their fruits and he said do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit amen brother what fruit are we bringing forth in our day-to-day living in our attitudes in our actions in our reactions what's the fruit that you bury are we laying down our lives for one another as Jesus lay down his life for us grace to us no one is coming to policy disappointments at the judgment yeah and you'd be surprised who made it and who didn't make it now graces mine prayer but at the grace of God brother just let me come to a conclusion with some thoughts by the Prophet concerning the anointed ones at the end time no doubt I have read the book I've heard the tape I've made notes but it never struck me as it did this time again that's why that I've got so many different colors and I lighted this underlined it and then I've I light it with this color that color another color each time that I read you know and it struck me different and I said Oh Lord this is serious and it's ever a revelation that we need to deal with its The Anointed once at the end time we need this oh yeah the seven seals or the mystery of God there's the mystery of God but listen all that God wanted us to have and all that God wants to hear and know wasn't revealed when brother venom preached the seven seals or the seven church ages Orca or the seven trumpets and so on no no because even after he preached the seals he preached a certain message and he said this is another revelation on the seals I believe that brother there's a number of messages that he preached after 1963 that was another revelation on the mystery of the revealed word and the anointing was at the end time is one of those revelations he didn't bring it out in the seven seals he didn't bring it out during the church ages but now nearing the end of his ministry a man he's bringing out the seriousness of false and ninety ones and now a that to deceit of false anointed ones grace and he said what could I say he said I'm feeling really definitely led to preach he said on the seven last miles in the Bible and now he says so that we won't be too long on a great lesson this morning he said I have sought the Lord he said thinking a man is not his own ideas it's God's and he said what could I say knowing that this may be our last service that we'll have her have he said why because the coming of the Lord is so close a taint how close is it now grace I pray in the name of Jesus under a false anointing that we're not going to be deceived yeah and failed to recommend yeah be deceived and why missed the rapture and will be left here to say where's the rapture oh it's already happened and you didn't know it why didn't know it we got there oh I was anointed I felt 19 with this and ninety with that yeah but you went off to a false teaching you didn't get into the true anointing that would bring you to the original the resurrection and rapture and give you a resurrection and rapture in faith they gave you faith to believe that God sent a prophet it gave you faith to believe that the seals were open and the mysteries revealed give you faith to believe this concerning the church ages but you didn't catch the revelation that the rapture was on the resurrection was already in progress oh yeah yeah I've in 65 and number of times he's highlighted the fact that the rapture is is ongoing the rapture is going on now but when is it going to come to a climax pray God that we're not going to miss it and ask where's the rapture get into the spirit stay in the spirit living the spirit walk in the spirit a man and be led by the word that the spirit the Holy Ghost is redeeming not the false anointed once he said the coming of the Lord is so close at hand he said I see that prediction made in California sure there's houses out there and places sinking at the rate of 30 inches an hour he September's cracking and breaking in we're at the end well even now in California as I said they're building walls if their houses are built near the near the ocean they're building walls with brick brick walls behind arouses why because little by little the water is coming in to the land yeah and what is it it's because that there is a crack that has gone up through California it's there they know that they know that they've known that for years and they said well it could happen now or could happen down the road scientists were saying you know they didn't know but the scientists still believe that California is going under but God through the prophet said it was going under yeah and and that crack is there I know that even even I would say once they the country a foreign country that sent over those ships and submarines and they went underneath California why because California is not like Newfoundland deer where it just goes out out into the ocean honored under the ocean no the land goes out here but when you go underneath California in a submarine you can go underneath it in the water because California is is calm so that's why it's gonna break and fall into the ocean because there's nothing there to hold it up oh yeah those submarines went in there and they were surprised to think that they could go under California in a submarine and go around and I believe brother's going to go all the way from California right on up to the other state and go on there and I believe it's going to affect even even the Vancouver British Columbia well I believe that no no way god help us he said it's sinking at a rate of 30 inches an hour and Timbers cracking and breaking in and they don't know what's doing it but we are at the end now he said I have decided and I felt led by the Holy Spirit to speak this morning on prophecy to inform us and the Holy Spirit has given to us to warn the people of the coming it's a warning so let this message be a warning to us if there's ever an hour that we're experiencing false teaching false christs and false prophecies this hour it is beyond your Girt and again let me say it again and again and again and no wonder is the Bible told us make your calling and election sure if there's that deception anyway you've got to make your calling and election sure make sure not you're just under the anointing make sure you're under the right word they're teaching what for to give you resurrection Rattray faith because that's what God wants to do amen God brought Luther under lien under the anointing amen then he gave him the faith of the justification yeah I tell you it changed Luther oh really a diocesan right from the inside of the inside he changed the burden that was there was gone oh yeah he would wondering about this one day with that it was all gone thank you lord thank you they meant and how did where did he get it as I said he did this he did that all he thought he had to do this all he had to do that to be justified you know do this for God do that for God do this forgotten so finally you know where he went into the church and the Bible was in the porch could they never read the Bible was like they do today no the Bible was in the porch of the church and he went over started reading the Bible and it's and he read concerning justification justified by Christ faith in our Lord Jesus Christ oh it struck him the Holy Ghost was there to give him the revelation and a nursery put down only or alone he wrote he wrote it on the Bible brother grace that will come back to the word a man concerning the rapture and the resurrection I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and he said bear with me he said I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed talk about believers he said in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump that's referring to 1st Thessalonians 4:16 at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed hallelujah grace that God is going to make that faith as he did to Luther oh yeah it'll strike us as justification struck Luther a man as sanctification strong Wesley the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit struck the Pentecostals this is the crowning of the Pentecostal message where at the end he said I have decided I felt led by the Holy Spirit to speak this money on prophecy to kind of inform us and he said I have not informed and anything happens just casually we should know about this we should know about this and he said this Holy Spirit he said has given to it to us to warn the people of the comings the comings you know the Bible said that God will do nothing except first he shows his servants the prophets and now that jesus warned the people what would take place and now that the prophets warned the people what that would take place and it behooves us now in the great hour that we are living in he said what's going to happen in this age he says so one of these strange subjects he said that perhaps we have read many times and he said I fell upon my heart to speak to the people about it this morning and he said it's going to be a Bible teaching and like a Sunday School and he said I've got many scriptures written down here that you might be able to put these down and go home and study them and he said that we might know and be warned they might know and be warned and prepared for the hours that we're living in oh well we think all we need is the opening the seven seals all we need is over the series under Revelation 10 or the church ages no no there's more to it one thing to know what God has done another thing to know why he did it why did he do it I know you did this nor do I know you do that you did you did you did yeah but why did I do it oh well you better get back into it and find out why I did it what I'm looking for amen he said that we might know and that we might be warned and prepared for the hour that we are living in and that's when the prophet of God went in and he read a scripture we recently considered number of times Matthew 24 concerning there shall arise false Christ's false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that ever were possible they shall deceive the very elect what is it it is man following man not following God and there's a lot of believers following me they're following this ministry that ministry that ministry oh we love this ministry we love that man yeah you better make sure you're following Jesus amen make sure that he's revealing Christ to you and he said I believe that we are living in the end time and we are now at the end of the history of the world and there will be no use of writing it history because there won't be anybody to read it it's at the end of time and just when I do not know just how long it will be not even the angels of ever know he said they don't know that minute or hour but we have been told by the Lord Jesus that when these things that we see now begin to come to pass he's to lift up your heads for our redemption is drawing nigh what else does God have to do to get us to look up what else does God have to reveal to us to get us to focus on resurrection and rapture in faith god help us how many of us already believe in the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride not that we're not we're not going to a marriage we're going to a marriage supper we're married here by the grace of God so there's an invisible union of a heavenly bridegroom and the earthly right how many are bringing forth the life of one with Christ how many are bringing for the life of the bridegroom not me make your calling and election sure he said listen he says your redemption is drawing nigh and he said what drawing nigh means I do not know he said it may mean as the scientist said concerning California and so on oh he said it could be a minute it could be five minutes he said they didn't know when it was going to happen but they felt it was drawing nigh it was drawing nigh then it's drawing nigh now so the god of grace be with us brother that we're not going to be deceived by false Christ's and false prophets a false teaching Amen oh yeah a true anointing but a false teaching and they can do signs and wonders oh yeah I cut theirs ministries out there preaching Trinity the Trinity's there preaching false baptisms false this false that oh yeah and have signs and wonders yeah I could highlight a number of evangelists said that I would that I was as well and certain to extent i supported and highlighted back maybe fifty years ago it's hard to believe that it's been that long since I've been in the message oh yeah and all the Adventists that Rhonda seen then with signs and wonders yet their preaching was contrary to the word but the anointing was there to do this the anointing was there to do that but false teaching of the word will we'll have to leave it there and the Lord willing see as the Lord brings us back maybe on Wednesday to continue and to bring her some thoughts concerning the false Christ's and false prophets because many many believe oh they're not real dirt they got a fall so ninety No thank God for the Prophet he says they got a true genuine anointing but a false teaching so god help us brother just thing and that's that's not out there that's around the message so you'd better make your call and election sure oh we like this ministry we like that we like that we're like that you better make
