more reality the coming of our lord jesus christ amen the resurrection the rapture amen father is a reality the word made flesh in us the word being made flesh in them grace grace as we committed all into your care soul body and spirit the grace of god be with us in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen and amen let's say now i believe now [Music] [Applause] [Music] all yes are possible amen [Music] with that faith of the resurrection and the rapture amen brother that that we've been in the word with the word amen believing the word amen and because especially the word for this hour this age what is it brother it was for luther's age what they did at wesley's age amen the pentecostal age but the bright age is the resurrection and the rapture amen others did what god wanted them to do in their day are we doing what god wants us to do in this day amen are we really really really the bride that's entering into the resurrection rapture are we there really the bride that believes the resurrection believes the rapture amen so brother it's not it's not over there it's not up there it's right here amen the dead in christ are waiting on us and we think oh we're looking up there waiting on them no they're here waiting on us amen because concerning what god has done in these last days brother is blending time with eternity amen is getting the bride is getting more and more at least we ought to be getting more and more conscious of eternity amen and brother not being more and more caught up with this whole world not by any means we're getting sick of it amen as i said the anointing was on jesus and brother if the anointing is on mrs jesus you're going to have the same attitude and what attitude jesus said oh jesus got to got to the place where oh he had enough of this old world he said he's how long shall i be with you amen and to talk about they're going up again to glory he said no man has ascended up but he that came down even the son of man who is in heaven brother he was on his way and he wanted to go amen oh yes he had enough when it comes to dealing with with unbelief the same thing with the bride brothers after you're dealing with so much unbelief and oh yeah we see more and more of the works of the devil brother we want jesus amen we want to get out of here amen we want to get into eternity the promises of god for these last days so god help us is my prayer brother concerning and praying grace that god has found the pl the plus in you and me that we're born again because the power of god preached you must be born again and i'll tell you this if you're going you're looking for a resurrection you're looking for a rapture only those that are born again are going to be there amen and you're if you're born again you're reflecting jesus amen the bride is reflecting the bright group by the grace of god praise the lord and concerning the message and the ministry of the hour brother bradham said he said he said he has come down to get his bride amen and remember i preached it one time and i talked about he was engaged engaged engaged to the with the bride and sending her gifts oh yeah and and finally it struck me oh he's he's come down now to be united with her he was engaged he gave her gifts oh brother write all down through luther wesley pentecost and other revivals amen but now amen he's coming into a union with the bride he's receiving his bride to take her home amen brother i tell you if there's anything that the revelation of the seals has to do with it has to do with the rapturing faith the problem of god said god has done this god has done this god has done that he's what for he said to give us rapturing faith have you got rapturing faith and you've got rapturing faith you're claiming the promise of the rapture amen if you've got rapturing faith you're pressing on and you're you are indeed looking up into another dimension grace amen so be in prayer as we go into the word and again just i can keep yours for 24 hours but i'll try to i'll try to be as not not to use too much because i got there's about four or five different messages that i have here by the prophet amen and would take several hours for one amen for the grace of god amen grace of god be with us the grace of god amen give us that hunger and thirst for what we need amen you brother might need this you're another brother need that another sister need this another sister needs that so be in prayer hungering and thirsting for what you need and god is there to provide what you have need of what for to give you faith amen the faith that pleases god amen and also just uh yes i note just to say thank you oh yes thank you for those that went to the baptism amen just this morning and the grace of god to those that were baptized to fill them with the holy ghost amen and amen i tell you if she's god you fill with the holy ghost you're going to concentrate more and more and more on the resurrection and the rapture amen amen so and also i just want to uh thank our brother jonathan for the ministry of the word that he was giving amen and i was even thinking today i said maybe we should get him the minister again i said i'm glad he said he you only need five minutes to get ready amen so grace of god be with us amen the grace of god be with our brother jonathan amen because he when we need him it'll be in season out of season amen so grace of god that he'll be ready so in john chapter 14 and beginning to read at verse 1 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me amen and in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and have seen him amen and brother we know him and we have seen him praise the lord god bless his word you may be seated and turn with me again to john chapter 3. a number of scriptures a number of quotes will do as the lord leads us and in john chapter 3 and verse 1 and there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god amen amen grace i trust we come from god and we're going back to god amen for no man can do these miracles that thou doest accept god be with him brother and we can't take the stand we take except god is in us with us and around us amen and amen take the stand of the bride reflect the light of christ and reflecting christ amen if there's any faith that we're reflecting is our faith in the resurrection and in the rapture by the grace of god amen so brother has god moved in luther's day and he gave him the revelation the focus was on justification justification amen morning noon and night they preached it morning noon and night the same as in wesley's age amen saying to vacation and brother in the age of the pentecostal revival again as i said the world was shocked concerning what was going on not just over there like luther was or over there like wesley was it was going on around the world north east south and west the pentecostal revival and they said what's going on they're doing this they're doing this they're in africa they're they're over in america they're over in england and so on amen god was moving by his spirit amen and more and more the ministry was getting worldwide amen because it was coming down to the end amen wherein god was going i praise the lord to bring forth the resurrection and the rapture amen so brother's not looking not just putting don't don't don't cast it off and say well oh yeah here you are they're going to they're going to bring the resurrection they're going to bring the rapture the prophet of god said the the young people the younger generation in his age back in the in the 60s he said they're going to they're going to be here not the older generation he said but the younger one is going to be here for the resurrection the rapture and brother now the younger ones are the older ones amen by the grace of god and and you're and you god is requiring of you that you're going to live a certain revelation you're going to live brother a certain thing that god reflected what god is doing amen are are we in our thoughts our words and our days are we reflecting what god is doing amen there's too many believers god did this god did this god did that but brother to the bright god is doing this god is doing this god amen because we've been brought out of the future into the present out of the past into the presence amen that's when they they asked jesus concerning christ and he said i am amen that i was amen that i will be he said i am amen just say again as he says he said to to martha concerning the raising lazarus from the dead he said i am the resurrection oh she said oh he's going to rise in the resurrection up there and there's a lot of evil believers got that same faith amen but jesus increased her faith oh yeah not to believe the resurrection of the future no he said i am the resurrection amen it wasn't in the past it wasn't in the future he brought the revelation the resurrection into the present amen he was challenging her faith i am the resurrection and he said if any man believes in me though he were dead yet shall he live and no man will die if he believes in me praise the lord no because we're going oh well brother wait a minute we're going to we we've got to have this funeral that funeral yeah but why worry with that that old body amen because god got a new one for us and we get out of this one we get into a theophany body praise the lord hallelujah and brother there's too many believers now oh you're just looking for the resurrection of the road resurrection up the road oh this is going to happen that's going to no it's happening amen even the rapture because the prophet of god said he said the rapture has been going on all the time amen and brother now we're getting into the greater and greater and greater revelation and reality of the rapture amen brothers again god help us brother that we're not just looking back and saying god did this god did this and and even in our age you know god sent a prophet and and the seals were open yeah but what what is god doing as a result of what he did amen by the grace of god god did this for a reason god did that for a reason so are we reflecting the reason that god did for it are we pleasing god amen with our faith oh my brother sister god is looking for resurrection and rapturing faith why because he has given the word that that will produce resurrection rapturing faith amen all that god has done is more than just saying oh i believe god did this god did that what's he doing amen don't let's not get into the revelation of god past tense let's not just focus on the revelation of god future tense let's let's hallelujah let's identify with the present tense revelation of god what is he doing in the world what is he doing in in your life amen hallelujah what is god doing in your life what is god revealing amen how is he revealing himself to you amen and his brother of anything that is revealing himself to the bride the resurrection and the rapture amen because god sent the messenger god said he had a message amen and what was it for not just to get us out of the nomination not by any maids no brother it is to get us into the resurrection of rapturing faith amen it is to get us to that place where we're looking up amen and we are separating more and more and more from the world we live in and the things of this old world were not interested amen jesus wasn't interested he wanted to get out amen he he didn't want to stay no longer and amen he just wanted to do what god ordained for him to do and brother oh my he was on his way out until finally brother the great pressure came on him amen that brother the bride is experiencing and what did jesus say not my will thine be done amen so what are you living are you living your will amen are you living in his will now my will thing be done what you do how you live by the grace of god brother it's jesus in you amen as christ reflected himself in you but brother again not not past tense not future tense present tense amen it's what he's doing now amen brother we know what he what he's done oh brother in the ministry of malachi 4 brother if there's anything that revelation that we ought to have of jesus is that we are in the time of the resurrection the rapture amen it is amen it is the end of all things by the but by grace brother is putting you and me into eternity amen amen brother it's one thing to reveal this to us reveal that to us we know this we know that yeah but what's what are we doing amen what is god doing in you what is what is what is the word accomplishing in you and through you you say i believe you really believe the word you really believe the message if you really believe it and it controls you brother i tell you this it's reflecting jesus amen it's reflecting what jesus is doing amen and you're getting further and further away from what's going on over there and you're getting more and more into the reality of a resurrection and a rapture amen oh yeah we've got this body oh well praise the lord i'm oh oh lord we're getting into the glorified body amen so i pray grace that we are closer to eternity than time because what god has done and what god is doing is pulling us away from time and jesus was getting more and more away from time he was getting more and more conscious of eternity he along as he kept saying how long shall i be with you amen and he wanted to go back yeah amen and if god is in us if christ is hit us brother we want to get out of here amen we want to experience the resurrection we want to experience the rapture amen and we want to we want to truly experience jesus in glorified bodies amen not oh it's not just saying by faith by faith by faith yeah but that faith is to get press on press on press on amen if we're really getting into the faith that god is giving us through the revealed word we're getting less and less conscious of time and more conscious of eternity we're hungering less for time and what's going on in this whole world and we're hungry more and more and more for the resurrection and the rapture so god help us brother in the name of jesus god elvis that we're gonna lose our hunger and thirst for what's going on in this world to what and we want to thirst and hunger more for what god's doing amen listen if you come from there you want to go back there amen jesus came from eternity and he wanted to go back after he spent just the number of years that he spent in time oh my and he was 33 when he laid down his life amen but in his young days in his young years remember he was testifying of the word he he come from the word he was the world he's going back to the word amen going back to god and so on but just know to notice this that even when he was just a young man young boy amen and it's a and his mom and dad uh physically they were they were looking for him where or when they were visiting jerusalem i believe and and oh where is he oh they thought he was with the other young ones with this one with that one no they they wouldn't look for him they couldn't find him so they oh we let go back went back to the city amen and where was he he was in the temple amen what was he doing he was preaching the word amen oh yeah he was he was fellowshipping with the with the with the jewish leaders there and the religious leaders and he was expounding to them the truth amen oh yeah mary went in and she was upset and she said what are you doing she said you're doing this you're doing that i mean we you should have been with us and so on he said no don't you know i must be about hallelujah my father's business amen he had the revelation who he knew who he was and he knew what god required of that flesh and blood amen and he said i'm about my father's business amen so what are we to be about amen they're looking for me looking for you where are you where are you oh i'm i'm on my way to the resurrection rapture what oh yeah jesus has come down and he's given me resurrection rapturing faith in the opening of the word the revelation of those seven seals amen and the prophet said god did that they owe me the seals he said was to give the bride rapturing faith amen amen well brother to give us rapturing faith it's got to make us more and more conscious of the rapture that's right amen makes more and more conscious of the revelation of the rapture oh yeah he came he laid down his life he picked it up and he came to share with us amen but now as i've said he's here hallelujah to re he redeemed us spiritually amen but now he's here to redeem us physically into a glorified body by the grace of god amen so i trust brother that he has recognized you and you have recognized him and what he's done and what he's doing let go and let god have his way not my will but thine be done oh grace of god as i said brother sister i hope that we're oh that we're not here to say oh where's the rapture i thought there must be a rapture and then the voice says oh it already happened and you didn't know it amen that's right yeah oh i pray grace that brother what god has done what god is doing that we know it amen so the amen well what's god done and there's not luther not wesley not pentecost no no it's the bride oh what's he done for the bride he's given he come and he opened his word he finished his mystery amen just think their god was going to come to god was that at a mystery in luther's age and wesley's age the pentecostal age and all them through the ages the mystery of god the mystery of god amen god wanted them to do this repent and be baptized repent and be baptized amen but brother he wanted us to repent be baptized but also move on to eternity that's right amen don't don't stop there oh yes there's one god and he gave us this revelation and this doctrine of this doctrine amen we repent and we get baptized in his name amen oh yeah but there's a faith now that the end of that that god's looking for luther and then went and do what they did or they repented and now that they had water baptism but it was all in the titles no doubt amen but yet god blessed them because they were emphasizing the revelation of justification amen and god never required of them what are they required of you and me oh yeah god never required of the wesley and the methodists god never required of the old-fashioned salvation army because the prophet of god said god raised up the salvation army or read william booth he said with red hot salvation he said to take the message on to the pentecostal revival amen praise the lord and then go and again lord brother sister god has given given us access to what luther had access to what what wesley had access to what the pentecostal agent and what god did in pentecost he gave us access to that but like he said god never took it away he said the gifts are just on the shelf that's all they're just right there amen but the bride is being moved on to the resurrection and the rapture amen so is the resurrection and the rapture more conscious to you than justification sanctification yes the baptism of the holy ghost because to me if you really got the revelation as you should of justification and god has given you sanctification amen and the gifts of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost amen brother if you if you've experienced what god has done then brother you're experiencing what god is doing now because brother what's it doing it's going on and on and on and on and on to now he requires of us what he didn't require them amen it requires of us but he didn't require the of of the pentecostals amen amen oh yeah well what he was doing was was pointing us in the right direction he justified us sanctified us good lord let's move on okay come on my son and went on to the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen wonderful lord your your more and more power is is revealed more and more power your power lord is being manifested lord what's next the resurrection and the rapture amen so brother and we we got this the faith of luther's age the faith of wesley's age the faith of the pentecostal age and brother brother brown said in 1965 he said pentecost don't realize this is the crowning of the pentecostal message amen and what is it now brother he did this he did it brother amen brother god knew what we needed and he provided it amen amen in luther wesley pentecost amen and then on down to the revealing of the bride by the grace of god amen to give the bride oh yeah pentecost went around the world with the gifts amen yeah but then god came down and they were amazed when it comes to william branham they wanted william branham they wanted william even pentecost why oh because of the gifts and god was healing god was doing this god was doing that yes but the problem of god said yeah he had the first move the second move into the third phase of his ministry he said get the people to believe amen why because the first two signs that he had was was to attract their attention show them god was living jesus was alive amen the same yesterday today and forever and then what about the third is he said now he said you get them to believe the third amendment amen and it'll give them the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture amen oh brother and that there's ever an hour that the bride ought to be crying and calling and believing for the resurrection is this when we consider what's going on in this world brother we want to get out of here amen because when when god experienced this in different ages he he came down and he brought judgment and then he moved on giving us a greater revelation then he brought judgment into that age amen and he moved moved us on and gave us a greater and greater revelation amen until he would give us the revelation of the rapture to get out of here to make an end to it by the grace of god so i pray grace brother that we are truly born again amen by the living word of the living god and we're truly born again and brother we're oh yeah we're conscious of god but brother not just the god of yesterday the god of today we're more and more conscious of what god is doing amen and god is reflecting what he's doing in your life in your attitude in your spirit amen amen so that he is in control and brother for the resurrection rapture he's got to be in control amen so again not you living it's jesus living in you amen is christ in in the flesh of his bride amen praise the lord in the flesh of the bread room look what he did well he's doing the same in the flesh of the bride amen changing us from time to eternity praise the name of the lord hallelujah so again in john chapter 3 verse 1 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews and the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest accept god be with him and jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god without the new birth will not see what god is doing amen nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water the natural birth and of the spirit the spiritual birth he cannot enter into the kingdom of god amen well we're all born of water amen but are we born of the spirit amen amen well if you're born of the spirit you have the nature of that spirit the holy ghost and are you really reflecting the nature of the holy ghost as jesus did amen in his day grace and he said that which is born of the flesh's flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit and brother it's the holy spirit amen not just a human spirit it's the holy spirit hallelujah and marvel not that i said unto thee ye he must be born again and brother if god required the new birth then god required a new birthing wesley and lutheran the pentecostals god requires a new birth in you and me amen because with the new birth here comes the new nature with the new birth you get a you get the revelation of that new nature you've got to get an understanding of that new nature and what god is doing amen not what the all you have the religious people are doing spiritual now there's too many people that are religious we got a lot of religious people around the message oh yeah that's right oh but how many are spiritual amen your religious ones oh god did this god did that thank you lord i believe it thank you thank you no god said what's up what am i doing that's what i did what am i doing amen again it's like i said when i was in a church years ago and many years ago and i was at i was on the platform and we did this and we did that there was a maybe an altar call or like i said it might have been people coming up around the altar back in that age you know in a service after the sermon oh they were waiting for the invitation waiting for the getting to the song service and believers would make it to the altar and start to pray and rededicate themselves to the lord and as i said i know right now that on my mind by my left there there was two sisters come up and they were standing there oh yeah they had their hands up and worshipping and i said oh lord i said something wrong with them amen i said they're not going to make it oh my lord have mercy yeah they went out but then they left the message and they went on into the world that's right why because because they they weren't in the holy ghost in their soul they had anointing in their flesh but not in the soul amen amen and probably god identified those things as well amen oh yeah he experienced those things he he he met people like that amen and brothers there's time that's why sometimes that when in the in the altar when he when he had a prayer line and so on and this one would come they said brother brown what did you do this for what you do that for you say oh you say uh okay sister okay brother okay yeah just go on and trust the lord because he knew they were gonna die or maybe he knew they were dead spiritually oh yeah they said that's why you did that yes that's why i did it he said that that god wasn't going to heal him god didn't heal them and they died and brother again like i said when i when i saw this one come and that one come i said oh lord i said they don't have the anointing that that you want us to have grace to us amen that's why the bible says let's make our calling and our election sure amen it's not you're not making it sure just become a church here amen it's in your personal relationship with jesus amen trust him by grace that we're here because it's the result of that personal relationship with jesus and he's leading me by grace amen to god be the glory brother let's make sure that we're born again brother is not not in the outside man but in the in the soul that's right if you're born in the soul then by the grace of god you're going to focus on the spiritual the spiritual the spiritual what god is doing thank you jesus for what you did the lord uh oh you're doing this i want to be a part of that don't let me miss it lord don't let me miss the resurrection don't let me miss the rapture yeah grace oh well well i i would say listen there's two about two million or more believers around the world for this message yeah and when the bride goes they won't know she's gone so if 2 million left we won't know but the probably god said there might be 200. yeah that'll go into rapture living saints oh yeah and even even narrowed it down to a dozen one time he said there might be a dozen because when the bride goes you won't know she's gone amen that's why that when god begins to move in the fulfillment of his word and this is happening and that's happening amen scripture is being fulfilled air here here amen and they'll say oh i thought there would be a rapture yeah it was because you missed it and you did you didn't know it it already happened since you didn't know i pray the grace of god that we're going to walk in the spirit live in the spirit so that why the holy ghost is keeping us conscious of spiritual things he's keeping the spirit conscious of what god is doing amen and brother what god has done by grace amen brother again they were looking for this looking for that jesus that i am amen amen there's a world looking for it i am amen what you're looking for i am amen the resurrection and the rapture amen what of the bride because he as he came to redeem us as i said spiritually and now he come back to redeem us physically oh he has to take us on to eternity amen amen amen don't want to miss that physical redemption that's right by the grace of god amen well oh i got an experience oh you can have it in your flesh as the prophet said you can have the holy ghost in your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell amen amen we want it in our souls amen because god is working from the inside out by the grace of god he said the devil is working from the outside in amen he's working in our flesh he's working in our emotions he's working in our feelings and so on amen amen all this this again as the prophet said you can have it 24 hours a day go to hell amen that's right because the heart is not right amen oh oh in their flesh they might dress right and talk right and act right but in their hearts there's something wrong amen well god see again god why is this one going to hell then well they're nice people but see we look at them and we see this what does god see amen amen god sees the heart amen amen oh you can you can make yourself oh yeah and elsa over there that brother is nice that sister is nice they got a nice attitude nice there's that god looks and says why there's there's serpent seed what oh but they're nice no he said i i see in the heart it's not so nice what god sees in your heart amen amen this is what god's looking at the inside of the inside amen and yet there are those that seem to be so good physically but they're miserable and oh yeah wicked spiritually oh yeah i've met people but they were so nice and they were good yeah but let the pressure come on them for the word see what they're going to do amen god help us brother the pressure's coming on us to believe amen that we've been born again the pressure's on us to believe that we are looking for the resurrection rapture how much longer is it going to go on how much longer are we going to endure this whole world amen because i tell you the devil is getting more and more and more control oh yeah they're turning everything over this way doing this doing this yeah and yet it's going to be so close that would receive the very elective possible that's amazing what it's going to be so close to reality he said that it'll deceive the very elect if possible amen wars brother sister we better be on our guard amen we better make our calling election sure we better make sure that we're living for jesus we'll humble yourself i'm by yourself amen so that you that the lord loves you and you love the lord by grace amen that the brother he lived for us and he died for us and he rose again amen god apostate we're going to live for him we'll die for him amen brother because we got to die to the world the things of the world amen so that we're alive to god a lie to jesus when following jesus leadership in our lives by grace amen by the grace of all my help us lord amen that we are living for jesus amen jesus is living for you now in your soul in your spirit amen and if it's jesus in you you you can't get away from what he's doing that's right amen and what's he doing now oh oh he brought me into the message yeah but what for yeah the devil also brings us to the message he also quotes the message he's he was the first evangelist in the in the earth the devil was okay he came and he started starting to minister to to eve in the garden of eden yeah he was an evangelist and he said oh yeah yeah god said yes god said not the devil he was saying yeah yet god said amen and he was using the serpent there you know that creature back there then amen to deceive eve amen and well yeah he used the serpent and he was talking through the serpent and that is the missing link between man and beast because god cursed him oh yeah people think man man began as a monkey as this and as that no no the serpent was that was the missing link amen and that back then oh yeah they were so close to the to each other oh yeah that in the relationship that eve had with the serpent she brought forth cain amen i don't think it's all spiritual no no there was a physical thing going on and before came oh yeah and cain had to add the nature of the devil amen but she brought forth also after that she went and she showed a e adam this and out of that and of course then she bore a child for adam and he had the nature of adam and redemption praise the lord amen he did one thing k did another but they both worshipped they both worshipped god amen that's right amen oh brother and even today god's seed serpent's seed brother both worshiping god amen and they think as i preached this view years ago and on springdale uh the springdale street empire avenue i preached it years ago and concerning what happened and this and this and this concerning i saw all preaching on which church would you go to which church would you attend cain's church or abel's church and i showed him what abel's church was like oh my what we're going to go to that church oh something wrong there why because he he had a lamb there and he was dead and the blood all over the place blood over him yeah but oh my i can't go to that church and but over here was king and cain had this church oh my he had all the the fruit of the field that he grew this and grew this and in the vegetables maybe and they put it all related all out for the lord gave all this to the lord but here comes that here comes abel with this bloody sacrifice so i said which church would you go to which church would you think was the real church it's like well it's like our brother jonathan's father said years ago he said my oh my and they were talking about brother joel preach and he said one brother he said well dribble the girls preaching he said the seats are covered with blood and i thought oh covered blood i felt bad about it but then oh i said that's good i said as long as it's the blood of jesus amen to show the redemption for us oh yeah because he felt the oh bill joe preacher so hard he said by the time he's finished he said everybody's bleeding yeah and there was a stranger there at the time that during that service he was on my right said he had the last pew there and oh so i never heard that again but he said it's the it's the truth oh yeah i don't know what what he believes or where he is now he might be gone on on on to his eternal reward somewhere pray god rest his soul if he's gone but he said oh brother that's the truth after the service he said i've never heard these things before but he said what you said was true amen and he said i believe he said this that's what what god god teaches amen thank you thank you thank you you'll never forget it he said amen brother sister do we believe it oh yeah because again and as i was saying what church would you attend and there's a lot would would not allow don't go to this church and we've had them here but they left helia and went to the mainland and again i remember one they say this that uh somebody one time came back to sister manuel that was back years ago in bishop falls and they were saying oh they were believers they said oh they said what's what's what's seen here in newfoundland he said it's not sitting up there. the sister man said what oh they said it listen listen she said according to the word of god she said what's in here sin everywhere amen she said so she said there's somewhere they're compromising up there and they were and this is why a lot of new planners left there and went to a church up there amen because they weren't they weren't hearing the word as hard as they would hear it here oh yeah oh they'll they'll preach this here in newfoundland and preach that but up there they don't preach that no no again what sin here is not sent up there what's in here is the center around the world i don't care where you go amen so god help us brother sister i pray in the name of jesus he got control of you morning noon and night you're not living for yourself you're living for jesus amen you're living for the word knowing that you're living for the body of christ yeah you're living for your brothers and sisters in christ that's who jesus was living for thank god he was living for you living for me and he laid down his life for us amen so i pray god in the name of jesus help us to make our calling election sure make sure you're born again oh well i know i'm born again you've got an absolutely new nature amen you had this nature even religiously but now you've got a new nature spiritually amen it's just not religious saying uh oh i believe in god well so does the devil amen but do you believe god one thing to believe in god another thing to believe god god help us amen and god help our young believers that we're baptized today amen amen to continue on with their relationship to continue on nurturing their relationship continue on amen not just physically but spiritually amen if you let the spiritual part have control of you and your soul amen god will control you physically by grace make sure it's not god in your head it's god in your heart not god in your flesh god in your soul amen by the grace of god because brother branham even during the end of his ministry he found he was discovering that even those in his own church were not representing the word as they should oh yeah he preached he preached argument he preached church order that was one of the hard messages and he preached other messages and as our brother fulcher not by the foster brother brother lee vale asked brother branham and he said brother our brother brother emmanuel and he said brother manuel he said do you know why the prophet preached church order and the prophet said well i guess he just preached it or brother manuel said i guess he preached it just to just keep his church in line with the word you know in order and the right time for this the right time for that and he said well brother i'll be honest with you he said he preached church order he said because he said there was too many in the church with gifts but they were not true gifts of god amen he said so he said he had he was trying to bring bring a stop to it amen and bring it under control because sometimes that they would go into that church and for the for oh the prophet be waiting before he come to the pulpit or brother levail waiting till before he come to the pulpit so long it might be an hour two hours why because there were those in in the assembly there those in the audience there felt they had this gift and that gift and they were manifesting gifts they spoke and interpreted this spoken said this all they said oh thus saith the lord thus saith the lord oh yeah they were standing on their feet and brother neville said well brother he said brother brown knew that most of those gifts were false amen the result of false anointings and he said that's why he preached church order and he told him he said to to meet together before the service started to meet together somewhere in that room and he said and and let the lord speak and let the lord do this and he said let's let the brothers that that are also there some of the elders oh yeah write it down copy it and and if they feel it's the lord give it to the pastor to read yeah so he said brother that's why he did it because he said you bring under control the false anointings amen and the false gifts that were there oh yeah and again as i s i highlighted to it to you here just recently when i was preaching a certain message and i said look i want you to notice i said he's preaching it in branham tabernacle and what did he say one of them tremendous he said listen he says he said i want you to hear this oh you have three kinds of believers and he said listen he said remember he said you you are in the message but the message is not in you amen amen and we're dealing with that even today you know there's a lot of people in the message but the message is not in them amen that's why i could say about those two sisters and they weren't they weren't real young and as i said they're in the message but the message wasn't in them amen oh yeah so i pray the grace of god that we're in the message but pray grace that the message that you are yeah and the message is in you amen you're just not in the message and you oh yeah physically you reflect the message physically and intellectually but what about the word god in control spiritually controlling what you do what you say what you think amen see sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god out of your soul amen so i trust by grace that we're led by the spirit the holy spirit amen so i pray grace not well eve was led was not led by the holy spirit she was led by a spirit but not the holy spirit amen grace to us and grace to our young people that was baptized today grace oh i appreciate our the other young people here oh it's amazing grace grace to them that they that they love the lord grace that they're all they're worshiping and raising their hands grace said they're clapping their hands amen let go and let god have his way god bless them so keep them in prayer as i said this is why we have visiting preachers and this is why they they have remarked about it you know that they're surprised that they're going to see young people worshiping amen young people doing this young people are doing that it's amazing that's the grace of god amen so god help us brother to go forth reflecting the life of that's being born again by the grace of god amen my i thought i'd be able to get into a message where we'll see by the grace of god later turn with me oh yes we read it okay first john chapter 5. amen i understand that we're having some fellowship with brother marx and sister mornings today so they'll let us know what time to be there god god bless us please in the name of jesus are you born again check and how will i prove it well compare your your life to the word of god the word of god in flesh look what it did is it doing that in you amen is he in control amen so it's first john chapter 5. amen oh god have mercy and let's start with verse 1. whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god amen jesus is the anointed one jesus is god we're not into a trinity amen and everyone that loveth him that beget loveth him also that is begotten of him amen praise the lord brother if anything is in the bride is love because god is love amen and again there's that catholic priest said to do regarding brother branham and when he when he was killed in the accident and they interviewed him about william branham and he knew william branham he had met william branham he had fellowship william branham and uh well while he's going to hell no as i said be careful what you say and compare what you think about those out there leave them with the lord and move on and you plead the token amen so and and why because i said listen they're not in the city but there's going to be many outside the city that's right and the only thing that's going to keep them keep them away is is the wrong spirit in their hearts amen the wrong thoughts and motives and objectives in their lives amen so we pray the grace of god to them but he said whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth him that beget love of them also that is begotten of him amen how can you have an experience with god are going to be born again with that anointing in your life and not have divine love in control amen again as that catholic man said he said if you knew anything about william branham when you when you met him he said you knew he loved you he said because he had that anointing he had that that within him and with him was divine love oh yeah that's what he said and that was that's recorded maybe in in the paper that uh the newspaper that i got that from the jeffersonville that time oh yeah i got to copy that newspaper and and the article is there concerning william branham's death and they interviewed this one interviewed that one and so on after the accident and brother again i think the ones that really fought against william branham will be the ones maybe mainly mainly pentecostal or something like that but brother to those that had a relationship with jesus no matter how a minor it was whatever i think they respected william branham because he respected them amen amen do we love them as as jesus loved us if you've got experience with jesus you have jesus spirit you have his attitude you have his anointing god help us amen so he said in verse 2 by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous no we love to stay with the word amen not not everybody will will love that your stand for the word yeah pray god recognizes it and appreciates it for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world see if you're born again you've overcome the influence of the world the flesh the devil amen and he said this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen we're going by faith not by sight amen no no don't go by your feelings don't go about what you're seeing no no you go by what you're believing in your heart that god is in control in your heart god's in control in your soul and again sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen and i tell you if you're lived by the spirit you line up with the word now if you live by the spirit it's the word that controls you oh yeah because the spirit is going to lead you according to the word amen amen amen praise the lord hallelujah trust him by grace that's why we're here and trusted by grace that's where young ones were baptized in water they were hungry and thirsting god was dealing with them they knew what the word said they said we'll do it amen thank god i pray god continue to deal with even the the other young ones amen because that all has to do with salvation and when it comes to being saved we have to be born again in a relationship with jesus if you got a real relationship with jesus he'll bring you to that new birth oh yeah so the grace of god jesus is controlling you you're not living for yourself no not by any means you're living for jesus amen it's jesus living in you amen and you're living for one another but not for yourself grace amen why because you want you want to please god amen so you lay down your life for him hallelujah to do what he wants you to do grace so by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments so not just oh i got a relationship with god yeah but you you're going to be constantly lining up with the word amen no matter what you do when you do it how you do it where you do it you're led by the spirit amen you're doing it for the glory of god amen and said for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god amen and this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only no but by water and blood and it is the spirit that bears witness because the spirit is truth amen and there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one amen and brother there's that wonders there's that unity and brother if we got the holy ghost he's reflecting that oneness and that unity among believers oh yeah is one by the grace of god and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one amen and again he said if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater amen don't follow human relation leadership follow god's holy ghost leadership amen for this is the witness of god which has testified of his son and he that believeth on the son of god at the witness in himself he that believeth not god has made him a liar oh my lord grace please that we believe the word and we love god we're going to stay with god not my will father thine be done amen it says god has the witness in himself he that believeth not god has made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and the life is in his son and he that had the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life eternal life and these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us yeah not just anything but anything according to his will amen and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him amen under verse 18 says we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not well some people say oh the least mistake you make you sin no no you don't sin habitually or the bible says if we sin we have an advocate amen that's right but again when we read when i studied the scripture there concerning sin and it says when it comes to sin among believers you're talking about habitual sin you do not commit habitual sin no no because you've been delivered from it the enemy might trick you into it but so as what he said if we sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous he's there to defend us by the grace of god amen shoulder don't condemn the brother or sister for this for this pray for them and move on amen by the grace of god there goes you but for the grace of god amen and it says but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness and we know that the son of god has come and has given us an understanding amen i pray god give us understanding of the word that he's been ministering today amen that we may know him that is true and we are idiom that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life little children keep yourself from idols yes god help us oh yeah the enemy is there to all to get to get your attention to idols this idol that all this becomes your idol that becomes your idol why because you put more answers on that than you do of jesus amen grace to us again bear with me he said ye must be born again he said we are pilgrims and strangers in this world yeah well i feel like it i'm a pilgrim and a stranger how about you grace and he said we are seeking a city whose builder and maker is god and when misfortune fell to you upon these things of the devil he said trying to burn you out and scare you away we're with you 100 amen to stand behind you and everything that we can do to help you back to your feet again amen rise in the name of the lord jesus and go marching on he said many are the afflictions of the righteous amen but god delivered them out of them all and we know that we look for those things to happen but we know that we also look to our savior who is more than a conqueror we are in him who has redeemed us amen i trust that we are in christ amen grace of god amen just one more quote and he said now he said looking now for something to take place during during this year and this was 1962 and many visions has been coming to me recently the other morning a great one again and all pertaining and looking he said like a great something fixing to happen and what was the fixing to happen and this was 1962 what was fixing to happen was the opening of the word amen the seven seals so he said i just
