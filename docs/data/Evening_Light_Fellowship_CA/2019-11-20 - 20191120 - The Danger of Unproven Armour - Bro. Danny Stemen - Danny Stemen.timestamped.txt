[48:01] a man so we pray that the Lord would
[48:03] deal with her in her soul amen and then
[48:06] God will bring the past the promise
[48:08] brother listen see we got to go beyond
[48:12] when it comes to Redemption brother it
[48:14] goes beyond you know just it's in our
[48:17] souls I've been redeemed I've been
[48:19] redeemed
[48:20] you know I've been redeemed spiritually
[48:22] and physically they met by the grace of
[48:24] God and what we're experiencing
[48:28] spiritually we're going to experience
[48:30] physically amen we were caught up
[48:33] spiritually we could being caught up
[48:34] physically by the grace of God and you
[48:38] can be impress I contact with certain
[48:41] individuals overseas and they're there
[48:44] wanting more understanding of the
[48:46] rapture I remember some time ago that an
[48:50] individual wrote me and and he said
[48:53] where in the world to get rapture he
[48:55] said that word is not even in the Bible
[48:58] and I remember responding to the brother
[49:01] I said well brother that's the s the
[49:04] English word I said what does that mean
[49:05] I said to be cut off and I said well is
[49:08] that in the Bible cut off and I said
[49:11] it's there you go here go there go there
[49:13] and I said in English it's rapture I
[49:15] said I don't know what it is in French
[49:17] and I said I don't know what it is in
[49:19] German I don't know what it is in some
[49:21] other language I said or whatever your
[49:23] languages and so on so I said brother
[49:26] that's just that's just a word but I
[49:28] said you'll find the meaning of it in
[49:30] the Word of God you'll find it's a
[49:32] promise to the seed of God the sons and
[49:34] daughters of God so I said brother if
[49:36] you got any other thing that you can
[49:38] further explain it let me know never
[49:40] come back
[49:41] a man so no brother so mother it is it
[49:44] is a resurrection and it is a rapture
[49:46] because that the Bible preaches it the
[49:49] Bible teaches it and the Bible gives
[49:50] prophecy concerning a man the physical
[49:54] resurrection and the physical rapture by
[49:57] the grace of God so we're looking
[49:59] forward to that by grace so be in prayer
[50:02] and for the revelation of the of the
[50:06] rapture being prayer for for your
[50:08] pastors he tries to endeavor to help
[50:10] explain to different ones that are that
[50:13] are emailing me you know they want to
[50:16] understand this they want to understand
[50:17] that and so on and the brother looking
[50:21] for understanding of the rapture and I
[50:23] would Brian sent him in all mine
[50:25] then the quotes I sent him on the
[50:28] rapture well you know some of the quotes
[50:30] that I've used recently concerning the
[50:32] rapture the rapture the rapture come
[50:35] back and he said no you still didn't get
[50:38] the revelation of the rapture
[50:41] whether takes god it takes your melody a
[50:44] man it takes the Holy Ghost amen
[50:48] well he wanted he wanted to he wanted to
[50:51] find a quote directly by whether Branham
[50:54] saying that the Hinton message is the
[50:58] revelation of Rattray fate and it's
[51:01] there it's a little here a little there
[51:03] my other folks I give brother you ought
[51:06] to come up with that revelation that the
[51:08] message of the hour is resurrection
[51:11] Rattray faith what was Luther's message
[51:13] what was his faith justification and
[51:16] brother everything God does in every age
[51:18] it was to give faith for that age a man
[51:21] and it was adding to our faith and so on
[51:25] trouble justification sanctification the
[51:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of
[51:29] the Spirit so what what what's left
[51:32] what's left now the only thing left now
[51:35] is the resurrection and the rapture amen
[51:38] praise the name of the Lord
[51:40] so I thank God for that revelation I
[51:42] think offer that understanding to God be
[51:44] the glory amen so I made every to share
[51:48] that with the Saints across the island
[51:51] cannot love cause the other but around
[51:53] the world a man
[51:54] so there's many that have contacted me
[51:57] for this this this this by pray grace
[52:00] the Holy Ghost shall be there to give
[52:02] them the revelation they need amen
[52:05] to God be the glory so again just to
[52:10] remind you that the Lord willing on
[52:13] Sunday I have asked our brother vice
[52:17] ruler to give his testimony amen I I
[52:23] offered him tonight but no it was too it
[52:26] was too fast it was too close and
[52:28] because that was only yesterday I
[52:31] believe I was asking him and so we will
[52:36] all give our our brother some time on
[52:39] Sunday to give his testimony and I I
[52:41] felt to do this after he was baptized in
[52:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[52:47] did ask our brother you know concerning
[52:49] his first baptism and it was in it was
[52:52] in the titles not
[52:54] not the name of the titles it was the
[52:55] titles a van and he explained to me you
[53:00] know when he was first baptized that way
[53:03] but thank God for the grace that brought
[53:05] him to the word and brought him to the
[53:07] weight because it was anything that God
[53:10] looking for now it's the name mother and
[53:13] if there's anything a bride it's going
[53:15] to take from her husband or her mate is
[53:17] his name a man she changes her name to
[53:20] his name by the grace of God a man so I
[53:24] have been Lord dealing with our brother
[53:26] Weiser and trusting and believing that
[53:28] our brothers are part of the bride of
[53:30] the Lord Jesus Christ a male and that he
[53:33] needed the name not just titles well I
[53:37] would baptize in the name of the son now
[53:39] what is his name you know if you're
[53:42] baptized in the name of your pastor
[53:43] what's his name and so on so there has
[53:47] to be a name oh yeah
[53:49] so and any I've had to deal with
[53:53] government-issue sometimes work for
[53:55] different individuals outside the city
[53:57] and go and find out what their name was
[54:00] you know when they were dedicated when
[54:03] they were baptized as children or babies
[54:04] or whatever and so on would you get
[54:07] would you please go to the government to
[54:08] get this get this they wanted proof they
[54:11] wanted evidence and so on that they were
[54:13] you know dedicated or they were born as
[54:17] it were and that it was registered and
[54:19] because it was a time when preacher's
[54:22] brother had to add to when they dedicate
[54:24] a child or baptized the child in a
[54:27] church it was a preacher's
[54:28] responsibility to register with the
[54:31] government but it's not that way now I
[54:33] know it's all done through the hospital
[54:35] and so on so the clergy has been omitted
[54:38] and and put out but there was a time
[54:41] when I when I had the I had to go and
[54:43] search this church that he would would
[54:46] through the government for certain
[54:47] individuals amen and I didn't search it
[54:50] for myself because I discovered that the
[54:57] name that I was using it wasn't exactly
[54:58] according to the name that was
[54:59] registered in government a man so I had
[55:03] to go back and get him to change it but
[55:06] again the
[55:07] one of the names was what it was the way
[55:09] that there's the way that the clergy
[55:10] back then understood it and the way that
[55:14] he would spell it and he didn't spell it
[55:15] right a man it was totally different
[55:18] a man so we have we have to change those
[55:22] things but thank God for mother we
[55:25] needed things change regarding the name
[55:26] of our Savior the name of our Lord the
[55:29] name of our bridegroom a man and thank
[55:31] God
[55:32] brother this is one of the reasons why
[55:34] he sent the messenger of the hour
[55:35] amen brother it was it was changing us
[55:39] from church to bright a man and just
[55:43] saying is not the spirit and the church
[55:44] say come the spirit of the bride say
[55:46] come a man that is absolutely tremendous
[55:49] and you're going to the book of
[55:50] Revelation and it explains the bride and
[55:53] and the marriage of the of the the bride
[55:55] to the bright grow by the grace of
[55:57] Almighty God revelation 18 tremendous
[56:00] praise the name of the Lord that we can
[56:03] identify ourselves in Revelation the
[56:07] book of Revelation a male and going
[56:10] beyond the church ages we're going were
[56:12] writing to the bride age by the grace of
[56:15] God the bride uniting with the
[56:17] bridegroom praise the Lord for the
[56:19] revelation and we were more than willing
[56:22] to take his name a man we entered into a
[56:27] relationship with him maybe in different
[56:29] churches but then God brought us under
[56:32] the Ministry of a prophet a man to bring
[56:35] us into a more personal and a more
[56:37] intimate relationship a man and to bear
[56:40] his name and write what is it's a
[56:43] confirmation to that we have an intimate
[56:46] personal relationship there's like Jesus
[56:48] said to the foolish virgin I never knew
[56:49] you they're not lost he's just said what
[56:53] did he mean he didn't know them
[56:54] he had no intimate relationship with
[56:57] them as bride know he's like a bride
[57:02] that's like a bride having an intimate
[57:03] relationship with a bridegroom the
[57:06] bridegroom with his bride a man
[57:08] it's a confirmation or or or capybaras
[57:13] and oh my capping off the the the
[57:16] marriage a man exactly
[57:19] so brother I trust you understand what
[57:21] that is and there's a relationship
[57:23] between a man and a woman and loving
[57:26] they love they love to finally it's it's
[57:29] brought together and it's climaxed a man
[57:32] and after you marry each man is there's
[57:35] an intimate relationship to climax that
[57:38] marriage by the grace of God as someone
[57:41] has said that might have sent myself
[57:42] here yeah that we live in a three-room
[57:44] house you eat in the kitchen fellowship
[57:46] in the living room and he said but he
[57:49] said the the intimate relationship is is
[57:53] dealt with in the bedroom amen
[57:56] by the grace of God your you give
[57:59] yourself to one another by the grace of
[58:02] God
[58:02] and as Jesus gave himself to us we gave
[58:05] him ourselves to him amen and when he
[58:08] says I never knew you he mess what he's
[58:10] referring to I never had no intimate
[58:13] relationship with you amen
[58:16] they had a religious relationship but
[58:18] not an intimate one amen thank God for
[58:22] that revelation so that brother makes
[58:24] sure that like I've wanted to go on into
[58:27] repentance you repent you're baptized
[58:29] just pray that it's absolutely genuine
[58:32] let's pray that God has acknowledged it
[58:34] that God has got us confirm your faith
[58:37] and give you the baptism of the Holy
[58:39] Ghost and the rapture of the Holy Ghost
[58:41] is God is Christ and the believer
[58:43] entering into a very intimate
[58:45] relationship he's taking control amen by
[58:50] the grace of God praise the name of the
[58:52] Lord but I tell you he hasn't got
[58:55] control of all believers amen but he
[58:58] does have a he's got a control of some
[59:00] but not all I trust he's got control of
[59:02] your life
[59:03] it's a confirmation that your
[59:06] relationship was climaxed a man you
[59:10] entered into that that intimate
[59:12] relationship where he's taken control of
[59:16] you amen and you're giving him control
[59:19] as the woman would yield to the man so
[59:22] thank God for that revelation so the
[59:25] grace of God to our brother byesville as
[59:28] he will give his testimony on Sunday
[59:30] God's grace to be with our brother
[59:33] a man shall be in prayer for him amen so
[59:38] the Lord will turn with me to Revelation
[59:43] 9 no revelation 22 and I'm going to turn
[59:50] it we're going to have a brother
[59:53] minister to us by way of the internet
[59:57] tonight and we're going to hear our

[1:00:26] to us amen let your heart be open to
[1:00:29] receive what God is going to minister in
[1:00:33] Revelation chapter 22 and verse 8 and I
[1:00:40] John saw these things and heard them and
[1:00:44] when I had heard and seen I fell down to
[1:00:48] worship before the feet of the angel
[1:00:51] which showed me these things then saith
[1:00:56] he unto me see thou do it not for I am
[1:01:01] thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren
[1:01:04] the prophets and of them which keep the
[1:01:07] sayings of this book worship God
[1:01:11] I somehow agree with some of the
[1:01:15] brethren that feel that that this was
[1:01:18] brother Branham maybe in in a theophany
[1:01:20] form and he was dealing with John the
[1:01:23] Baptist's and he was revealing all these
[1:01:25] things to John amen and John was at the
[1:01:29] end of it all John was going to worship
[1:01:31] him he said don't worship Me and I'm
[1:01:33] just I'm just a prophet he said one of
[1:01:36] your brothers and so on and he was the
[1:01:38] prophet to whom all things were revealed
[1:01:41] a man the end from the beginning
[1:01:44] amen and it was in this hour and this
[1:01:46] age the prophet of Malachi for a man
[1:01:49] that he was given the revelation of the
[1:01:52] end not just a beginning not just down
[1:01:55] to a certain age but to the end even
[1:01:58] going from time to eternity
[1:02:00] and he said worship God and he saith
[1:02:04] unto me seal not the sayings of the
[1:02:08] prophecy of this book for the time is at
[1:02:12] a m-- ii that is unjust let him be
[1:02:16] unjust still and he was just filthy let
[1:02:21] him be filthy still and he that is
[1:02:25] righteous let him be righteous still and
[1:02:29] he that is holy let him be holy still
[1:02:33] and behold i come quickly and my reward
[1:02:38] is with me to give every man according
[1:02:41] as his work shall be I am Alpha and
[1:02:46] Omega the beginning and the end the

[1:03:29] these things in the churches amen and

[1:06:06] return to our brother Matthew
[1:06:15] amen we have a nice place let's all
[1:06:27] stand together amen amen
[1:06:35] for Samuel 17 verse 32
[1:06:51] something about babies this makes
[1:06:53] everybody smile I said just everybody
[1:06:56] remember the baby a man a man
[1:07:00] verse 32 very familiar story and David
[1:07:05] said to Saul let no man's heart fail
[1:07:10] because of him my servant will go and
[1:07:14] fight with this Philistine and Saul said
[1:07:17] to David thou are not able to go against
[1:07:21] this Philistine to fight with him for
[1:07:24] thou art but a youth and he's a man of
[1:07:28] war from his youth and David said unto
[1:07:32] Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep
[1:07:36] and there came a lion and a bear and
[1:07:39] took a lamb out of the flock and I went
[1:07:42] out after him and smote him and
[1:07:44] delivered it out of his mouth and when
[1:07:47] he arose against me I caught him by his
[1:07:49] beard and smote him and slew him thy
[1:07:53] servant slew both the lion and the bear
[1:07:55] and this uncircumcised Philistine shall
[1:07:59] be as one of them I want you to think
[1:08:02] for a moment about that faith that
[1:08:05] translates to this day where he has not
[1:08:08] fought that battle yet but he already
[1:08:11] knows the outcome if you know the
[1:08:14] outcome Amen you can speak to that and
[1:08:18] not to the Giant I mean this is not just
[1:08:21] a children story this is God showing us
[1:08:26] how to fight amen and he said amen he
[1:08:30] shall be as one of them seeing he hath
[1:08:32] defied the armies of the Living God
[1:08:35] notice he never just defied Amen a
[1:08:39] person he defied God David said moreover
[1:08:44] the lion that the Lord rather that
[1:08:46] delivered me out of the pall of the lion
[1:08:48] and out of the pall of the bear he will
[1:08:50] deliver me out of the hand of the
[1:08:53] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[1:08:56] and the Lord be with thee and saw arm
[1:09:00] David with his armour and he put a
[1:09:03] helmet of brass upon
[1:09:04] his head also he armed him with a coat
[1:09:07] of mail and David girded his sword upon
[1:09:12] his armor and he essayed to go for he
[1:09:15] had not proved it and David said unto
[1:09:17] Saul I cannot go with these four I have
[1:09:21] not proved them and David put them off
[1:09:25] him and he took his staff in his hand
[1:09:28] and chose him five smooth Stones out of
[1:09:31] the brook and put them in a shepherd's
[1:09:33] bag which he had even in a script and
[1:09:36] his sling was in his hand and he drew
[1:09:39] near to the Philistine amen you can be
[1:09:42] seated may the Lord bless the reading of
[1:09:46] his word amen I want to draw our
[1:09:56] attention to what David has said that he
[1:10:02] is telling of his faith by past
[1:10:06] experience I'm not so interested a man
[1:10:12] in in just what we say we believe I'm
[1:10:16] interested in what you believe produces
[1:10:19] a men for if what we believe cannot
[1:10:22] produce control over your own life
[1:10:24] cannot produce produce something that
[1:10:27] you have faith in then either it has not
[1:10:31] been quickened or you're in the wrong
[1:10:32] thing I think it always would pay for us
[1:10:38] amen to be established and know that
[1:10:42] we're established in what we stand for
[1:10:44] and we're not just social gatherers
[1:10:47] we're not just coming to church and
[1:10:48] saying I'm in the message amen but we
[1:10:51] know what the message is we know what it
[1:10:54] produces we've seen what God has done in
[1:10:57] the past we see what he's doing now
[1:10:59] therefore our faith is not shook Amen by
[1:11:03] what's in the valley in front of us amen
[1:11:05] but we know by past experience that God
[1:11:08] Amen is going to work now
[1:11:11] and you notice a man excuse me thats all
[1:11:15] he tries to convince David to take his
[1:11:19] armor for the battle with Goliath
[1:11:21] brother branham called it saws
[1:11:26] theological vest now david has just
[1:11:30] given a testimony meeting of past
[1:11:32] experiences with god and of overcoming
[1:11:35] and yet Amen what God has done in his
[1:11:38] life and then saw hurt it but it seemed
[1:11:41] like it didn't even move him it was like
[1:11:44] okay you did these things and you've had
[1:11:46] that experience and God was with you but
[1:11:49] somehow Amen the supernatural never
[1:11:52] impressed saw enough to say God be with
[1:11:56] you instead he tried to help him more
[1:11:58] with his own amen covering a man and so
[1:12:02] I want to I want to I want to title this
[1:12:05] this morning the danger of unproven
[1:12:08] armor the danger of unproven armor
[1:12:14] remember when faith really hits your
[1:12:17] heart you don't have to have a
[1:12:21] spontaneous miracle a man as as we seen
[1:12:27] so often and in brother Mannis meetings
[1:12:30] that you see amen
[1:12:32] that was a faith that was being operated
[1:12:35] that would challenge the people's
[1:12:38] humanity and condition that he would
[1:12:41] speak to them and said if it was me I
[1:12:43] would get up off of that cot now how
[1:12:49] many of us would hear that word feel the
[1:12:52] pain haven't felt the surge of the Holy
[1:12:55] Ghost yet Amen you feel the weakness you
[1:12:58] haven't been able to get off the cough
[1:13:00] you haven't been able to get out of a
[1:13:02] wheelchair but the word is telling you
[1:13:05] get up now why is that because I mean
[1:13:09] there's something that's going to prove
[1:13:10] your faith and it's not going to be your
[1:13:13] theology
[1:13:14] and it's not gonna be your intellect
[1:13:15] it's gonna be your action towards alert
[1:13:18] you see God wants to see you act back to
[1:13:22] what he has already said theologies
[1:13:26] never impress God amen our understanding
[1:13:30] our intellect our reason amen has never
[1:13:34] impressed God
[1:13:36] aiming but it's our action back to the
[1:13:39] word is there something in my life
[1:13:41] answering back to the supernatural is
[1:13:44] there a supernatural response in my life
[1:13:48] that responds to the words amen
[1:13:55] the Prophet said that he saw we were
[1:13:58] watching a man laying here on a cot
[1:14:00] he was swelled up in his stomach and I
[1:14:04] was going to leave and the Holy Spirit
[1:14:05] called me and I looked and I saw the
[1:14:08] vision over the man and a moment he
[1:14:11] responded to it and his stomach went
[1:14:14] down and off the kadhi went rejoicing
[1:14:17] through the building he said the people
[1:14:19] in the stretchers the other night in the
[1:14:21] wheelchair it doesn't have to happen
[1:14:22] like that as long as you believe it's
[1:14:25] going to happen like that you can
[1:14:28] rejoice just as much as when faith takes
[1:14:32] ahold saying you have it as you could be
[1:14:37] if you were running up and down the
[1:14:39] aisle just like you was out of the
[1:14:41] wheelchair so now the prophets saying
[1:14:44] your reaction to the Lord in your
[1:14:45] condition is just as important as if
[1:14:49] it's already happened
[1:14:52] and as we heard Wednesday night that's
[1:14:54] why it's so important to stay away from
[1:14:56] a negative attitude negative
[1:14:57] negativities never fed faith wants Amen
[1:15:00] through the entire history of the world
[1:15:02] amen it's never fed your faith it'll
[1:15:05] never feed your faith so don't think
[1:15:07] your negativity's going to feed it today
[1:15:08] it's not going to help you now and it's
[1:15:11] not going to help you tomorrow and it's
[1:15:12] not going to help me preach but I'll
[1:15:14] tell you what will help me preach is no
[1:15:16] matter what your condition is that you
[1:15:18] can take the Word of God and say God
[1:15:20] that applies to me condition he's
[1:15:29] looking at your faith and when your
[1:15:31] faith answers back to the word the
[1:15:33] condition will line up
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:37] God will make your party obey your
[1:15:42] confession so I asked you what are you
[1:15:45] confessing you're confessing is not your
[1:15:48] thinking your thinking is where the
[1:15:49] battle is your confession is your
[1:15:52] decision right now the Lord stand with
[1:16:00] him in this heart I'm not asking if
[1:16:02] you're in the message I'm asking you
[1:16:04] have you got into it how's the message
[1:16:07] got into you here less how well you can
[1:16:13] put it together it's the life of it that
[1:16:17] makes you rapture it's a life of it that
[1:16:22] quickens us and he says here he says you
[1:16:28] can rejoice just as much as if you're
[1:16:30] already running out of the wheelchair
[1:16:31] you see it's a substance of things hoped
[1:16:33] for it's the evidence of things not seen
[1:16:37] you don't have to feel nothing you don't
[1:16:40] have to taste nothing the only thing you
[1:16:42] have to do is to believe something and
[1:16:44] then it becomes a positive something you
[1:16:47] possess that's your faith I mean how
[1:16:52] many in here have a temper problem raise
[1:16:53] your hand and a couple few honest ones
[1:16:59] and the others have other problems to go
[1:17:03] with it hey man glory glory
[1:17:06] hey man but you notice if you allow
[1:17:10] faith faith if you allow anger to
[1:17:15] control you there's no way it won't
[1:17:19] express itself and it'll cause you to do
[1:17:25] things that down in your heart you say
[1:17:27] well that's not me that's not the way I
[1:17:29] am
[1:17:29] I don't believe like it but it possesses
[1:17:32] your body and controls it now what will
[1:17:36] faith do that's controlled by the Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost
[1:17:41] you know with anger comes excuses well
[1:17:44] you know I just I did that because it
[1:17:46] was so what that's not good enough
[1:17:49] amen so you cannot you cannot use the
[1:17:52] circumstance to justify the anger amen
[1:17:58] but you see if faith takes a hold
[1:18:00] brother man talk about seeing a man with
[1:18:03] psychic ability explode
[1:18:06] a light bulb he said if a man under the
[1:18:10] control of Devils can do that what can a
[1:18:13] man under the control of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:16] what can he do Mountains can be moved
[1:18:22] children can be saved sick are healed
[1:18:26] you see brother Danny this is basic
[1:18:29] message no it's not if you haven't
[1:18:30] experienced it it's not basic to you you
[1:18:36] see you know many took the message after
[1:18:39] 63 and say that's the opening of the
[1:18:41] world and it is and they say that's what
[1:18:43] caught the brides attention and so we'll
[1:18:45] just quote this you know all the
[1:18:46] miracles never woke the bride up and so
[1:18:49] we we ignore all the supernatural and we
[1:18:53] go into a dead formal condition because
[1:18:55] we don't even know the foundation that
[1:18:57] he catches your attention first will you
[1:19:00] see before Moses could ever go into
[1:19:02] Egypt and throw down that rock he had to
[1:19:05] meet God in a burning bush he already
[1:19:10] knew the promises he already knew what
[1:19:12] Abraham had heard he already knew him in
[1:19:15] the theology of Exodus towards his
[1:19:17] people but he had never met the
[1:19:20] supernatural that would produce it you
[1:19:26] say you cannot accept it by an
[1:19:29] intellectual fault
[1:19:31] that's intellectual your minds will
[1:19:34] reason but faith doesn't reason if
[1:19:37] you've got intellectual faith then
[1:19:40] that's just a reasoning faith you would
[1:19:42] say well if I was only healed I could
[1:19:45] get up if I was only healed this lump
[1:19:48] would leave if I was only healed I would
[1:19:52] feel different
[1:19:53] if I was only healed the doctor would
[1:19:55] tell me so but when you've got faith all
[1:19:59] the doctors in the world could never
[1:20:02] tell you anything different you possess
[1:20:05] it it's the substance of things hoped
[1:20:07] for the evidence of things not seen
[1:20:10] yeah well brother Danny why is this
[1:20:12] important because I believe that God
[1:20:14] loves you so much that he doesn't want
[1:20:18] you to have ups and downs because of a
[1:20:20] physical problem because discouragement
[1:20:23] is is Rob's you of strength keeps you
[1:20:25] from serving God keeps you from doing
[1:20:27] your reasonable service your reasonable
[1:20:30] duty your depression all these things
[1:20:32] that that war against the mind your
[1:20:34] questions you're wondering what's going
[1:20:36] on
[1:20:36] you know God just encourages you even
[1:20:39] you know just just get close to the
[1:20:41] supernatural you get close by prayer get
[1:20:43] close by study don't stand off and
[1:20:45] wander get close to God and watch what
[1:20:48] he does he's the dissolver and the
[1:20:50] answer of every question you don't have
[1:20:52] to worry about a 10 you don't have to
[1:20:54] sit here in the sermon say look what is
[1:20:55] going on with that one eye what is going
[1:20:57] on with this one get close to him he
[1:20:59] answers all our doubts he answers all
[1:21:02] our questions you're not going to get
[1:21:04] strength out there you're going to get
[1:21:05] strength in here young men young women
[1:21:14] you'll never get strength amen by going
[1:21:17] home and watching a Hollywood movie
[1:21:19] never get it you can't get it you're not
[1:21:24] getting from Disney you might not you
[1:21:29] might see or hear a nice antidote out
[1:21:31] there in the world say well that's good
[1:21:32] that applies my situation that helps me
[1:21:34] that's fine but your strength does not
[1:21:36] come from that your strength is in the
[1:21:40] work and Satan will try to sever that
[1:21:45] lifeline and cause you to put on
[1:21:47] something unproven do you know why your
[1:21:50] life is miserable today if it's
[1:21:51] miserable because you are trying to walk
[1:21:53] in unproven armor
[1:21:55] not talking you're understanding the
[1:21:57] message what your operating and fighting
[1:21:59] your battles with unproven armor you see
[1:22:07] David has already said what I've had
[1:22:09] let's kill the bear and it's killed a
[1:22:11] lion you didn't have to be there to see
[1:22:13] it I know what God has done for me
[1:22:17] brother and sister I'm not preaching to
[1:22:20] you from what I heard about somebody
[1:22:22] else I have my own personal experience
[1:22:25] and I know my redeemer lives blessed be
[1:22:31] the name of the Lord I know
[1:22:37] notice you have to accept it you have to
[1:22:41] believe it you could go down to the
[1:22:43] altar if you could cry all night long
[1:22:45] you see a lot of us try to win the
[1:22:46] sympathy with God God doesn't he's not
[1:22:48] here to sympathize with you we try to
[1:22:52] win his sympathy God do you feel sorry
[1:22:54] about my situation huh he'll come on
[1:22:55] he's been through the dark ages amen you
[1:23:03] see we don't win a sympathy we accept
[1:23:05] his word you have to believe it you
[1:23:08] could cry all night you could beat up on
[1:23:10] the author you could scream - you can't
[1:23:12] scream no more still you're not safe you
[1:23:15] could feel real good and run all over
[1:23:16] the building the shout and still not be
[1:23:18] saved the devil can beat you around on
[1:23:23] your feelings if I had to go by my
[1:23:26] feelings every many times I'd be all out
[1:23:29] of condition but I don't rest on my
[1:23:32] feelings I rest upon the unconditional
[1:23:35] word of the Living God who made the
[1:23:38] covenant with me if I would believe it
[1:23:41] it's not what I feel it's what I believe
[1:23:44] Jesus never did say did you feel it he
[1:23:47] said did you believe it
[1:23:49] faith happens it's far beyond feeling
[1:23:53] you could feel tonight like your save
[1:23:55] and run around and praise God in the
[1:23:57] next morning you wouldn't have any
[1:23:58] feeling about it at all now let me just
[1:24:00] let me just tell you this there's many
[1:24:02] of you many of us we've said in the
[1:24:04] service amen the Holy Spirit is the xix
[1:24:06] you feel wonderful you raise your hand
[1:24:09] you say praise the Lord you go home and
[1:24:10] that same sickness strikes you again and
[1:24:12] you turn around and open back the door
[1:24:14] of discouragement and go right back down
[1:24:15] by and then pretty soon nobody loves you
[1:24:18] nobody cares for you I guess I'm always
[1:24:20] going to be in a in a condition like
[1:24:21] this but a greater testimony is no
[1:24:24] matter how long you've been sick no
[1:24:26] matter how many times things happen to
[1:24:28] you you maintain a good relationship
[1:24:30] with the Lord and I don't care it's not
[1:24:33] about what he's done for me it's about I
[1:24:35] want to worship Him no matter what many
[1:24:43] of you only base your worship on him on
[1:24:46] what he's done for you you're still in a
[1:24:50] denomination God wants to take it from
[1:24:55] you what's you I want to worship Him he
[1:25:08] said the next morning says you'd run
[1:25:10] around tonight I'm saved tomorrow
[1:25:12] you wouldn't have any feeling about it
[1:25:13] and you'd say I'm lost but when faith
[1:25:16] takes ahold Jesus Christ God's Son died
[1:25:21] in your stead he became you and your
[1:25:23] sins and you and yours that you and your
[1:25:25] sins might become him and his
[1:25:26] righteousness and accept him as your
[1:25:28] only perpetuation for sins then faith
[1:25:31] takes ahold and all Devils out of hell
[1:25:34] can't move it faith in doors faith
[1:25:37] locked something faith seal something
[1:25:39] and if a man has had faith to accept
[1:25:43] Christ he walks up from the altar he
[1:25:46] goes outside his associates say you
[1:25:48] haven't got nothing
[1:25:50] your eyes are still blue that's the same
[1:25:53] suit you are in there your nose is just
[1:25:55] as big as it was when you went in your
[1:25:57] fingerprints are the same there's no
[1:25:58] difference but you know there's a
[1:26:00] difference and in the ages to comment in
[1:26:03] the days and weeks you'll prove there is
[1:26:05] a difference because your faith will
[1:26:07] vindicate you're a Christian how many
[1:26:10] knows that to be the truth every man and
[1:26:12] woman that's ever accepted Christ if you
[1:26:14] can step out and trust your eternal
[1:26:17] destination upon your faith how
[1:26:19] much more can you step out with that
[1:26:21] little body of yours upon the same
[1:26:24] atonement Amen that he was wounded for
[1:26:26] your transgressions and with His stripes
[1:26:28] we are healed usually it takes
[1:26:33] experience I want to I want to challenge
[1:26:37] us that if we've had an experience with
[1:26:40] God before that literally changed your
[1:26:42] soul then why can't the faith of that
[1:26:45] same experience operate today in your
[1:26:47] life change your attitude you know why
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:54] uh-uh okay I'll back up I'm not going to
[1:26:56] say Amen
[1:26:58] now Amen now he said usually it takes
[1:27:01] experience many times we try to educate
[1:27:04] ourselves into believing that's
[1:27:06] intellectual there's a far great
[1:27:10] difference between intellectual faith
[1:27:12] and real god-sent faith intellectual
[1:27:14] faith reasons now talk to yourself what
[1:27:17] kind of faith do I have intellectual
[1:27:21] faith reasons ain't gonna work if I if I
[1:27:25] do it that way I got to do it this way
[1:27:28] and in your way that's proven that it's
[1:27:32] not proven brother Branham said one time
[1:27:40] Israel was called out to war against the
[1:27:43] Philistines of listings had gathered
[1:27:44] over on one side of the mountain the
[1:27:46] valley between them Israel on the other
[1:27:47] side and just like the enemy always does
[1:27:50] when he feels he's got the upper hand
[1:27:54] he likes to puff and blow and brag about
[1:27:56] it when he thinks he can make you cower
[1:28:01] down if the enemy thinks he can make
[1:28:03] that heart of yours flutter a few times
[1:28:05] and make you think you're not healed he
[1:28:08] likes to do that if he can make you look
[1:28:11] at your hand and say it's no better he
[1:28:13] loves to do that cause he's got you
[1:28:15] conquered right then
[1:28:17] I said now the reason I put this in here
[1:28:20] is because I just read this and it
[1:28:21] really struck me what a challenge of
[1:28:25] faith he said I see a crutch setting
[1:28:27] back here by a lady if the devil can
[1:28:31] make her believe she's going to have to
[1:28:33] use that crutch to go out of here
[1:28:35] she's whipped you know we like
[1:28:41] comfortable faith faith we can manage
[1:28:47] but when she won't look at that lets you
[1:28:50] look towards God promise it will be left
[1:28:53] at the seat say well I've been crippled
[1:28:57] for years that don't have nothin to do
[1:28:58] with it it's what God said that's the
[1:29:01] idea so the idea is now I can as I say
[1:29:07] that everybody's mind starts thinking
[1:29:08] about conditions and that's exactly what
[1:29:10] we're not supposed to do our focus is
[1:29:17] not condition our focus is the word
[1:29:20] brother branham set up here at Cato
[1:29:22] Tabernacle we had a meeting and a
[1:29:24] crippled boy come in here much prayed
[1:29:25] for you say brother Danny
[1:29:28] now we're far beyond this this is this
[1:29:31] is this is what they label you know
[1:29:33] we're beyond this somehow we've put
[1:29:35] intellectual beyond beyond supernatural
[1:29:37] okay but this is this is the
[1:29:40] foundational work that God used to catch
[1:29:41] our attention he said he said now they
[1:29:45] brought this boy a crippled boy coming
[1:29:48] here much prayed for him many of you was
[1:29:50] there to see him and they brought him
[1:29:51] back in that emergency room and and
[1:29:53] Billy brought him to me and they had him
[1:29:55] on the platform for three or four nights
[1:29:56] in the building he didn't get a prayer
[1:29:58] card so they put him in the in the the
[1:30:00] room and I went there and prayed for him
[1:30:02] and I looked at me says mr. Branum can
[1:30:05] you give me some consolation can you
[1:30:07] give me anything and I told him I said
[1:30:11] son yes sir said yes I said yes her son
[1:30:13] Polly always got you in this condition
[1:30:15] he said that's right
[1:30:17] I said your name is such-and-such and
[1:30:19] you come from a certain place now the
[1:30:20] boy had asked for consolation
[1:30:23] something he could do i how can i know
[1:30:27] and so what the brother branham do he
[1:30:29] told him his condition and he told him
[1:30:31] who he was
[1:30:31] where he lived so God was telling him I
[1:30:33] know you yeah I know you and I said and
[1:30:40] he said that's right I said you come
[1:30:42] from a certain place he said that's
[1:30:43] right he said what about my healing and
[1:30:46] I said I hit stripes you're healed now
[1:30:49] look what did he do he just quoted the
[1:30:52] word but he had told him who he was so
[1:30:57] the Lord was tyno you okay what about my
[1:30:59] condition by His stripes you're healed
[1:31:01] you see God's not gonna point you to
[1:31:04] something different he's gonna always
[1:31:05] point you to the word I said by His
[1:31:12] stripes you're healed so he went home
[1:31:15] testifying and giving up praise and he
[1:31:18] brought such a reproach in the
[1:31:19] neighborhood until one Sunday a group of
[1:31:22] ministers came down and set him down and
[1:31:23] set down by him and said you must stop
[1:31:27] doing that you're bringing a reproach
[1:31:30] upon the cause of Christ and the young
[1:31:35] man said in there and here's the key
[1:31:37] young man said in there said mister if
[1:31:41] you were sitting where I am you know
[1:31:46] it's really easy for you to say
[1:31:48] something about someone else's condition
[1:31:50] and you're not sitting there but this
[1:31:55] man was crippled and he was wanting
[1:31:59] something from God and when he'd been
[1:32:01] told he was been that he'd been healed
[1:32:03] in that wheelchair
[1:32:05] he just started praising the Lord and he
[1:32:08] praise the Lord so much that the
[1:32:10] minister said it's bringing a reproach
[1:32:12] in the neighborhood so let's talk not
[1:32:19] about your condition let's talk about
[1:32:21] your praise because what comes out of
[1:32:23] your mouth is what God has revealed to
[1:32:25] you amen and they said you must stop
[1:32:30] doing they said mister of you were
[1:32:32] sitting where I am if you were in the
[1:32:33] chair I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to
[1:32:36] rob me of the last hope I have
[1:32:39] in Christ you see how these ministers
[1:32:44] are trying to put something unproven on
[1:32:45] this boy he said by his stripes I'm
[1:32:50] healed her brother met him said he no
[1:32:53] more than set that sitting there
[1:32:55] paralyzed feet hands body back and no
[1:32:59] more than said that out of the cherry
[1:33:01] wind giving glory to God
[1:33:04] oh brother and sister you know what God
[1:33:09] wants you to do he wants you to believe
[1:33:11] him whoa brother Danny but what no
[1:33:14] believe him but brother Danny what about
[1:33:16] believe him
[1:33:17] amen What did he say only believe amen
[1:33:20] turn it around believe Oh
[1:33:22] amen what did it believe on me well if I
[1:33:25] turn around to only believe you can't
[1:33:26] get out of it he wants you to just
[1:33:28] believe what he said and he went out
[1:33:35] giving gaurav glorifying God what his
[1:33:37] natural senses said he would sit there
[1:33:40] the doctor said he will be there forever
[1:33:42] are as long as he lives but the faith
[1:33:45] since the sixth sense said by His
[1:33:47] stripes I'm healed and it cast
[1:33:50] everything away contrary to what God
[1:33:52] said that's what the sixth sense is for
[1:33:56] now if I was you I wouldn't sit and look
[1:34:00] at me and ponder what I just said I
[1:34:02] would react to it I wouldn't give a
[1:34:06] moment's consideration to the feeling of
[1:34:08] my body I would say Lord that's right
[1:34:10] Lord if I don't even feel any different
[1:34:13] in my body I raised my hand and
[1:34:14] acknowledge your word takes the
[1:34:17] preeminence over that King Bishop
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:24] but I'm seeing a lot of Christians with
[1:34:26] their heads uncovered no helmet of
[1:34:31] salvation to cover their mind and if you
[1:34:36] a men want to believe the devil's lie
[1:34:37] you have to first take off the helmet of
[1:34:39] salvation to believe him lay it on the
[1:34:43] ground and fight with an uncovered head
[1:34:44] but David said you've covered my head in
[1:34:46] the day of battle hey man what is your
[1:34:48] head it's where the mind is it's where
[1:34:50] the thoughts come into the mutual
[1:34:51] meeting ground between God and Satan
[1:34:53] that's where Satan tries to anoint you
[1:34:55] that's where God sends his word and it's
[1:34:57] your mouth that gives testimony to what
[1:35:00] is right let me tell you this I'm not
[1:35:07] saying this is a nice antidote and I'm
[1:35:09] not saying this is a nice story and this
[1:35:11] is not a little editorial in the
[1:35:12] newspaper this is the truth
[1:35:13] it works in school amen it works you
[1:35:17] don't have to be ashamed of what you
[1:35:19] stand for girls boys you don't have to
[1:35:21] be ashamed you don't have to let the
[1:35:23] world push your ideas on you you can
[1:35:25] make your stand and they have for
[1:35:27] respect it
[1:35:28] you know I don't worry ir5 like if I
[1:35:31] find out that if I I have to I don't say
[1:35:33] I don't worry I don't say that say but I
[1:35:35] find out that were in no work it'll work
[1:35:40] it doesn't give you strength just make
[1:35:44] you tired does wear you out Saul wanted
[1:35:57] to call David and armor that David's
[1:35:59] never worn David would have to put off
[1:36:04] what he has been using in order to use
[1:36:07] saws gift the purpose of armor is not
[1:36:15] just made for protection the purpose of
[1:36:20] armor has specific purposes
[1:36:22] instead designed not just to protect
[1:36:27] because we don't hide behind armor but
[1:36:31] rather armor equips you to fight better
[1:36:38] Saul's armor has been worn before when
[1:36:45] he failed to fully follow the Lord and
[1:36:47] destroy the Amalekites it's been worn
[1:36:50] before when he forced a vial on the
[1:36:53] people that as they were fighting you
[1:36:55] cannot eat all day long until we have
[1:36:57] beaten have defeated the enemy and and
[1:37:00] it calls them amen great problems he's
[1:37:03] worn that armor before his armor has not
[1:37:07] been proven the man who wore it was
[1:37:10] proven to be wrong but refused to repent
[1:37:12] I just told a while back the problem
[1:37:19] problem here is that leaders failed to
[1:37:21] repent failed to admit they're wrong I
[1:37:25] told that man I am willing to stand in
[1:37:28] front of the congregation have a meeting
[1:37:30] about it and if I'm wrong I will submit
[1:37:32] to correction but I want you there
[1:37:38] they didn't want to have the meeting
[1:37:43] listen you don't have to be afraid of
[1:37:46] the truth
[1:37:47] I found out it never did me any good to
[1:37:53] try to base my faith upon rumor it never
[1:37:56] did me any good to base my faith upon
[1:37:57] Amen want somebody else thought about it
[1:38:00] I've been told about this message before
[1:38:02] and Bill the building was just
[1:38:03] reiterated to them the other day by
[1:38:05] disciple of the man amen if you come to
[1:38:07] this church you have to check your mind

[1:38:11] honest for just a minute I wish some of
[1:38:13] you would you know in other words you're
[1:38:21] not intelligent you to believe this
[1:38:23] message you're just taking a taking a
[1:38:25] man's word you follow a man and you're
[1:38:27] not intelligent you don't use your
[1:38:29] intelligence and all let me just tell
[1:38:30] you this would you have used your
[1:38:32] intelligence to follow the Lord Jesus
[1:38:37] amen when the Lord looked at Peter and
[1:38:39] says even you gonna go as well he said
[1:38:41] lord I don't know where else to go you
[1:38:43] alone have the words of eternal life now
[1:38:45] I gotta be honest I don't understand
[1:38:47] what you're saying but I do know this I
[1:38:49] know God is with you well let me tell
[1:38:55] you what this message has been proven
[1:38:57] over and over to work it's been proven

[1:39:02] clean you up
[1:39:03] it's been proven to deliver you it's
[1:39:05] been proven why it's live prophets
[1:39:08] message it's God's message

[1:39:14] I mean what's the cloud or rocket or was
[1:39:16] it angels come on folks
[1:39:17] we're far beyond reasoning like that
[1:39:20] [Applause]

[1:39:26] wasn't underwritten and he's a false
[1:39:27] prophet you mean angels can't be here
[1:39:30] and there and there and here these are
[1:39:33] angels that can come in a split but the
[1:39:41] most important thing to me is the man
[1:39:42] that told me that check your brain in at
[1:39:44] the door that's all you guys do I said
[1:39:48] why don't we sit down and discuss what
[1:39:49] you believe by the Bible they don't want
[1:39:52] to do it they want to go on the
[1:39:53] questions they want to try to
[1:39:55] assassinate a man's character come on
[1:39:59] let's bring it back to the word because
[1:40:01] amen that's where our feet are shod with
[1:40:04] the preparation of feet of peace you
[1:40:06] know what I have peace in my heart
[1:40:08] because I know I'm standing on something
[1:40:10] a man that's built upon the rock a min
[1:40:14] the glob that designed the rapture it's
[1:40:17] the God that's in this building he
[1:40:19] designed this message to change your
[1:40:22] body a meaning to change your body yes
[1:40:25] to quicken your mind quick in your
[1:40:27] spirit quick in your heart and then your
[1:40:30] bodies will also be quickly that's why
[1:40:33] we preach like this is because you must
[1:40:35] be quick and inwardly before your ever
[1:40:37] be changed outwardly it mean that
[1:40:39] outward change can only follow let me

[1:40:56] but I want you to know I'm interested in
[1:40:59] what God is

[1:41:02] what he's got to give me from the Word
[1:41:04] of God I care less what science says
[1:41:07] about it I don't care what man says
[1:41:10] about it my eyes are on God and I know
[1:41:13] what he said about it what did God say
[1:41:17] about it Gloria why in the world when I
[1:41:29] want to dial up the devil to think what
[1:41:31] he thinks about this when the serpent
[1:41:38] came to Eve you can be sure before he
[1:41:41] ever got to Eve the devil had sit down
[1:41:43] and counseled him real good you're
[1:41:45] anointed for this buddy you're anointed

[1:42:20] to put an army armor on of a man who's a
[1:42:23] quitter
[1:42:32] why would you put a armor on of a man
[1:42:35] who don't know how to repent I don't
[1:42:42] want to wear unproven armor I want to
[1:42:46] wear armor that's proven hitmen in this
[1:42:49] show say men that that armor is always
[1:42:51] supernatural and not carnal Haman dad
[1:42:53] saw its right arm David with something
[1:42:55] carnal amen but David said I have not
[1:42:58] proven this and he put off the Kings
[1:43:00] sword he put off the Kings armor and he
[1:43:02] went back to what is defeated amen the
[1:43:05] enemy before so David took it off he
[1:43:15] took off what Saul had armed him with
[1:43:18] you need to take off what you're trying
[1:43:20] to fight with that's not working brother

[1:43:37] going to get worse your hearts going to
[1:43:38] get hard because every time you hear the
[1:43:40] word and don't respond to it that
[1:43:41] becomes seared hey men but God wants to
[1:43:44] come and take away the seared condition

[1:44:35] thing that's always worth the blood
[1:44:36] shall never ever lose its power how dare
[1:44:42] you question the blood of Jesus Christ

[1:44:48] brother
[1:44:51] try the enemy out pick up the sword of
[1:44:54] the Spirit I'm gonna begin to fight the
[1:44:56] battle you've been ordained to win David
[1:45:02] took them off you have to renounce
[1:45:05] Saul's armor you have to say it's wrong
[1:45:12] imagine how how foolish it looked to put
[1:45:20] off a king's armor and to walk out in
[1:45:23] the Shepherd's tunic with only a sling
[1:45:28] takes courage to stand up on the truth
[1:45:33] it's gonna take courage for you to stand
[1:45:35] up on the truth there's giants in those
[1:45:43] days you know brother Bantam looked at
[1:45:46] that and it's it's a saint it's a giant
[1:45:48] what was carnal then now spiritually in
[1:45:52] front of us he called it these
[1:45:55] intellectual giants like Goliath
[1:46:00] intellectual Giants like Goliath that's
[1:46:05] what we're facing you know what really
[1:46:07] struck me in the hour that we have men
[1:46:12] telling us it meant not to preach the
[1:46:15] word and not to do this and not to do
[1:46:18] that and that Paul told a young man by
[1:46:23] the name of Timothy Paul told him to
[1:46:29] stay in Ephesus I'm asking you to abide
[1:46:31] here while I go to Macedonia I want you
[1:46:34] to stay here that you might charge them
[1:46:37] in if Ephesus to teach no other doctrine
[1:46:43] he never told him now Timothy I just
[1:46:47] want you to read to them my letters he's
[1:46:49] telling I charge you to tell them quit
[1:46:55] teaching another doctrine other than
[1:46:58] what I have already talked
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:02] then he told him don't give heed to
[1:47:05] fables and endless genealogies which
[1:47:07] Minister questions you see a man even in
[1:47:12] Ephesus where the word had been taught
[1:47:14] in its meat now they begin to bring in
[1:47:19] more revelation that begin to minister
[1:47:23] questions to the people's hearts the
[1:47:27] word should not Minister questions it
[1:47:29] should minister answers I a man should
[1:47:34] not have received a prophets message and
[1:47:36] my heart has been turned by it and all
[1:47:37] of a sudden wondered was that the right
[1:47:39] message I didn't believe it the right
[1:47:40] way now I got a look at it all over
[1:47:42] again there's no fear and believing the
[1:47:48] truth I mean the truth does not Minister
[1:47:51] fear the truth does not minister
[1:47:52] questions the truth
[1:47:54] amen dissolves it there's a giant
[1:47:59] standing in our way
[1:48:01] the giant of intellectualism there's a
[1:48:06] giant standing in the way of our young
[1:48:08] people of sensuality the lure and the
[1:48:13] attraction of the world it's a giant
[1:48:16] that's so persuasive that young people
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:20] we'll get up and leave and walk out of
[1:48:21] the supernatural seeing what God has
[1:48:23] done and go right back to the world
[1:48:25] because it's a giant there's a giant a
[1:48:39] worldliness stands in the way of people
[1:48:51] you know you know the way to get around
[1:48:53] this giant that I'm talking about and
[1:48:55] just leave him there attack me tell
[1:49:01] David tell David he's a naughty boy why
[1:49:06] are you wanting to go defeat that giant
[1:49:10] attack the word is trying
[1:49:12] amen to tell you it's wrong why does
[1:49:13] resentment rise up in your heart and
[1:49:15] quietness settle on the congregation
[1:49:17] because you know these are giants these
[1:49:21] are giants that stand in the way the
[1:49:26] more I preach it the more you buy your
[1:49:27] head the more you get quiet the more you
[1:49:30] look away amen the enemies upon you
[1:49:35] amen but you are David ordained to fight
[1:49:38] David knew he was anointed David knew he
[1:49:41] was a good shot David knew he'd been
[1:49:43] vindicated
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:50] there's the domineering power of fashion
[1:49:58] man that comes in upon the people and
[1:50:03] they men they begin to drift and get
[1:50:06] closer and closer to the world don't
[1:50:12] give the devil the opportunity to
[1:50:15] paralyze your faith
[1:50:17] amen there's the giant of so-called
[1:50:22] public opinion some of us are living our
[1:50:28] life based upon the opinion of somebody
[1:50:31] else hey man the giant of public opinion
[1:50:40] amen the giant of indifference to a
[1:50:43] higher call a man a giant of unbelief
[1:50:48] these are giants and God wants men to
[1:50:52] meet them men and the men that meet him
[1:51:00] are men who are to be champions a men
[1:51:05] that bring with them genuine first
[1:51:09] realized truth what good is it to fight
[1:51:17] a battle with something you're not sure
[1:51:18] it'll work
[1:51:26] glory I mean God wants people who not
[1:51:31] amen not only can speak of what they
[1:51:33] know but have proof of what they know
[1:51:35] who can not only repeat but they can
[1:51:38] testify notice david has given the
[1:51:47] king's armor he's given a king sword but
[1:51:51] this King was a man afflicted with an
[1:51:54] evil spirit a man anointed by an evil
[1:51:57] spirit trying to convince David to fight
[1:51:59] with what he fights with amen
[1:52:05] Saul's leadership abilities did not meet
[1:52:08] the expectation created by his
[1:52:10] appearance because he was impulsive by
[1:52:14] Nature you know Satan studies your
[1:52:16] nature and he knows he knows your nature
[1:52:20] better than you know yourself and he
[1:52:21] knows what doors to open in order for
[1:52:23] you to follow your nature instead of
[1:52:25] follow the call of God and if you don't
[1:52:28] shut that door and tell the devil he's a
[1:52:29] liar your walk right through it and you
[1:52:31] find out that door closing a lot behind
[1:52:33] you and it's a lot harder to get back
[1:52:35] through it than it is to walk into it
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:41] see that's why the Bible said the wages
[1:52:44] of sin are death but it don't start out
[1:52:46] looking that way it's called the
[1:52:49] pleasure for a season amen so what did
[1:52:56] saw allowed his nature to overstep the
[1:53:00] bounds that God had given him he allowed
[1:53:03] jealousy to overcome him so he tried to
[1:53:05] kill David specifically amen
[1:53:14] that's a lessons from Saul's life God
[1:53:17] wants obedience from the heart not mere
[1:53:21] acts of religious ritual obedience
[1:53:27] church coming can be ritual religious
[1:53:31] obedience it should be the house of
[1:53:36] correction it should be judgment begins
[1:53:39] at the house of the Lord it should be
[1:53:42] where we wash ourselves they're all not
[1:53:46] to be an auth in your heart that you're

[1:56:03] needed element in our lives
[1:56:08] weakness helps us to empathize with
[1:56:11] somebody else in prayer
[1:56:14] [Applause]
[1:56:17] so in the week say they're strong it's
[1:56:21] saying I'm strong in the Lord praise the
[1:56:28] Lord they should help us remember our
[1:56:30] need when Saul had success his greatest
[1:56:35] success in the Bible came when he obeyed
[1:56:38] God his greatest failures resulted when
[1:56:41] he acted on his own Saul had all the
[1:56:48] materials he needed to be a good leader
[1:56:52] he had a parents he had courage he had
[1:56:56] action and God could have used his
[1:57:01] weaknesses if Saul had recognized them
[1:57:05] and left them in God's hands have you
[1:57:12] ever asked God to take something away
[1:57:14] and he never took it away well then it
[1:57:21] was obviously the weakness of your faith
[1:57:28] God take us away I'm not talking about
[1:57:31] immorality I'm not talking about
[1:57:33] uncleanness no about weakness you know
[1:57:39] maybe your weaknesses you tend toward
[1:57:41] negativity that's that's that's and I'm
[1:57:46] not not trying to speak against your
[1:57:49] character that's actually in nature amen
[1:57:54] and then there's other people that you
[1:57:56] know are always you know have you ever
[1:57:57] met the person that's always too happy
[1:58:03] well there is a time to cry you know I'd
[1:58:09] hate to have a doctor at my bedside
[1:58:12] you're going to die yeah it wouldn't be
[1:58:20] good bedside manners how wouldn't with
[1:58:23] that guy praying for me Oh God this guy
[1:58:26] you know you see there's a time yes and
[1:58:30] so but if you don't recognize maybe you
[1:58:34] have a weakness called anger amen only
[1:58:44] two people said yeah yeah anger is just
[1:58:52] a step away from insanity do you see
[1:58:56] what anger will do when it's anointed by
[1:58:58] drugs it'll go kill five people and
[1:59:04] shoot 20 more see what anger will do
[1:59:09] when it's anointed by a circumstance
[1:59:12] it'll speak against its brother
[1:59:17] anger is the opposite of discernment and
[1:59:22] don't dis quote the scripture to me
[1:59:25] about being angry and sin not because
[1:59:27] there is a righteous anger that we have
[1:59:29] to use and don't tell me your anger is
[1:59:33] always so righteous that you actually
[1:59:35] started cussing or something that's not
[1:59:38] righteous anger that's your anger don't
[1:59:43] tell me your anger was so righteous that
[1:59:44] it ran your brother down that's your
[1:59:46] anger don't tell me that it was the
[1:59:50] right anger that made you look like a
[1:59:52] fool and then you had to go pass a track
[1:59:56] about what you believed let me tell you
[2:00:00] if your anger is right try to give
[2:00:02] somebody let's just take the track the
[2:00:04] original sin and why you're angry try to
[2:00:07] give it to somebody be a witness of what
[2:00:09] you believe now I can tell you how you
[2:00:14] do it
[2:00:15] you take this book because in it tells
[2:00:18] you exactly who you are that's anger
[2:00:28] hallelujah
[2:00:30] weakness God can use our weakness but
[2:00:37] his own choices caught him off from God
[2:00:39] and then an alienated him from his own
[2:00:42] people have you ever prayed and asked
[2:00:46] God for something you wanted God to
[2:00:48] bless your family but the blessing was
[2:00:49] hindered by you what you prayed for is
[2:00:54] hindered by your own nature hallelujah
[2:01:01] man from Saul we learn that our
[2:01:08] strengths and our abilities will make us
[2:01:11] useful but it's our weakness that'll
[2:01:15] make us usable God will use your
[2:01:21] weakness our skill and our talent which
[2:01:24] we like to highlight make us tools but
[2:01:29] our failures and shortcomings remind us
[2:01:32] we need somebody in control I wanted to
[2:01:38] say this what you accomplished on your
[2:01:41] own is only a hint of what God can do
[2:01:50] you know you talk about our own ability
[2:01:53] and I I've got ability I can do this and
[2:01:55] I got ability in this area I got ability
[2:01:57] and you gotta be honest every one of you
[2:01:58] in here has a little bit of pride of
[2:01:59] what and what you can do right you got a
[2:02:03] little bit of pride you know I'm good
[2:02:04] maybe maybe you're good with math maybe
[2:02:06] you're good with English maybe you're
[2:02:07] good with this maybe you're good with
[2:02:08] languages maybe you're good with that or
[2:02:09] that or whatever you a little bit of
[2:02:11] maybe you're just proud in your
[2:02:13] weaknesses I don't know
[2:02:16] I'm proud I'm the weakest guy in this
[2:02:17] church and I don't have an ounce of
[2:02:19] ability I can't do anything I just I'm
[2:02:21] down all the time and I'm depressed I'm
[2:02:22] part of that what are you gonna do my
[2:02:23] buddy okay what I'm gonna do hey man
[2:02:28] well hallelujah
[2:02:31] I tell this story all over again here we
[2:02:37] only got one service a day brother Allen
[2:02:39] has actually said let's remember the
[2:02:41] service today and this evening but I
[2:02:48] like to tell this story because I was
[2:02:51] there and not because I was there but
[2:02:54] because I experienced it and and I've
[2:02:57] told it many times but I when I was in
[2:03:02] South Africa years ago and we went we
[2:03:06] was going to go up in the bush but
[2:03:07] before we did we had a house meeting and
[2:03:10] and these brothers come in they were
[2:03:13] brother how many remember Brian Jones
[2:03:15] you know me remember brother Brian Jones
[2:03:17] runs a rehab center there not far from
[2:03:21] the the the Kruger National Park and
[2:03:24] it's a world-renowned facility for
[2:03:27] animals and so we had a house meeting
[2:03:30] there on his grounds and there was men
[2:03:33] had come in and they had working off the
[2:03:36] coast up in northern Africa on some of
[2:03:38] the oil rigs and stuff and I mean he's a
[2:03:40] real man big strapping South African six
[2:03:44] five burly strong and we're going to go
[2:03:48] what they call sleep with the Predators
[2:03:52] which is the last part of a Ranger
[2:03:56] course that they have is where they take
[2:03:57] you in the bush and you can't buy a
[2:04:01] water hole or something and they drag an
[2:04:03] animal a dead animal around camp for the
[2:04:06] scent and try to draw in the lions
[2:04:08] hyenas and whatever predator will come
[2:04:10] in and you're there on the ground
[2:04:12] sleeping or watching and you get to
[2:04:15] experience that I saw pictures that he
[2:04:17] had of lions sniffing the feet of people
[2:04:21] in their sleeping bag so this is what we
[2:04:23] were going to experience
[2:04:25] and so anyway they had these these men
[2:04:29] there was going to be brother Brian and
[2:04:32] then myself and another minister we was
[2:04:36] going to be in another truck so that's
[2:04:37] two trucks and then the back truck was
[2:04:40] going to carry like four men and all
[2:04:41] these men were the ones that had been
[2:04:43] working up on the rigs and their lease
[2:04:45] trapping these big South Africans so
[2:04:47] they have this this mentality of their
[2:04:51] Bushmen you know they're strong and and
[2:04:54] and so we had the meeting and then we
[2:04:57] got to talk about where we're gonna go
[2:04:58] out camping and we're gonna do this and
[2:05:00] I never forget it and this man is
[2:05:04] talking to me said yeah he said I've
[2:05:05] been in the bush before and he says when
[2:05:08] I go I usually wear you know big knife
[2:05:11] on my hip and a gun and and so forth it
[2:05:14] says they call me ramble so that's good
[2:05:23] you know you know it's a it's
[2:05:25] intimidating to talk to Rambo you know
[2:05:28] and I mean he's just a stern stolid guys
[2:05:31] you know you're you know it's easy it's
[2:05:36] easy to say these things in a house
[2:05:38] meeting it's easy to say man in church
[2:05:50] okay so so we got done talk on his Rambo
[2:05:54] and in and on so we're gonna pack up
[2:05:57] after the service and we're gonna we're
[2:06:00] gonna go and so brother Brian he gathers
[2:06:03] us around he says not listen he says
[2:06:05] we're gonna be in the bush he says on
[2:06:07] the trail he says if I stop you stop he
[2:06:11] said I go you go you do whatever I do
[2:06:14] now notice the guide is telling us if I
[2:06:17] move you move you have to copy my
[2:06:22] actions so amen we're driving were we're
[2:06:28] in the middle of nowhere
[2:06:29] okay we're on a two-track driving
[2:06:32] through these through the bush and trees
[2:06:35] we come around the curve now
[2:06:38] so it's it's brother Brian in the first
[2:06:40] truck and then and he has in the back of
[2:06:42] the truck he's got half a zebra and all
[2:06:44] the equipment he needs to drag this
[2:06:46] thing around the water hole and then
[2:06:47] myself in a minute other administer in
[2:06:49] the next pickup in the back pickup is
[2:06:51] two men in the cab and two men sitting
[2:06:53] in the open air in the back and these
[2:06:56] were like little you know Nissan pickups
[2:07:00] or something they want these big old
[2:07:03] Chevrolet's a man and and so these
[2:07:13] little pickups and Rambo was sitting in
[2:07:15] the back now he had a big old knife so
[2:07:18] he's equipped right he's ready do we
[2:07:22] come around the curve and the next thing
[2:07:24] we know we're in the herd of elephants
[2:07:27] this isn't the zoo this isn't the house
[2:07:31] meeting and this is not him telling me
[2:07:33] I'm Rambo so they're coming across the
[2:07:37] track let me tell you these are not the
[2:07:39] elephants in the in the bush is not the
[2:07:42] elephants in the zoo okay it's a lot
[2:07:44] different and so they're milling around
[2:07:47] and and and an opening comes up and by
[2:07:51] the brian guns it and and the minister
[2:07:53] driving our truck he guns it and but the
[2:07:55] other truck just eases up real slow too
[2:07:58] and and they instead of following the
[2:08:01] way they should have they went real slow
[2:08:03] in the gap closed and the and the
[2:08:06] elephants closed and blocked the way and
[2:08:09] so now all them elephants we went up
[2:08:12] drove up went around the corner and out
[2:08:13] of sight and stopped brother brian got
[2:08:15] out and he sits there like it's for a
[2:08:17] while and you could hear these elephants
[2:08:19] trumpeting you could hear trees cracking
[2:08:21] and and he go he slapped his hand on the
[2:08:24] roof and he says I told them boys to
[2:08:26] stay with me thankfully they had Rambo
[2:08:34] so we they eventually we went and they
[2:08:37] they caught up with us and and they
[2:08:40] weren't dead they caught up and we got
[2:08:42] to the camp with him guys climbed out it
[2:08:45] was a different man that I had talked to
[2:08:49] in the house meeting it was not come on
[2:08:53] you know they called me Rambo and I
[2:08:55] heard her hey hey he was real quiet he
[2:09:01] sat down on this chair and he looked at
[2:09:04] me he goes it was very skinny very quiet
[2:09:13] everything was taken from him what we
[2:09:17] had been told the instructions we were
[2:09:20] given brother Brian took that tied a
[2:09:21] rope to that zebra and he drug it around
[2:09:24] the camp and around the water hole and
[2:09:26] so the scent would get out there and
[2:09:29] then he told us he said now what we're
[2:09:31] going to do is we're going to take
[2:09:32] watches through the night he says two
[2:09:34] men to a watch hour and a half per watch
[2:09:37] and so there was and he said I'm going
[2:09:40] to sleep so it was us and the other four
[2:09:44] brothers so that was three watches that
[2:09:46] we supposed to have in meantime the
[2:09:48] sun's starting to set
[2:09:50] we watched giraffe come down how they
[2:09:52] laid himself out to get a drink and you
[2:09:54] walk you saw snakes we saw other animals
[2:09:56] but were there for the Predators and
[2:09:59] he's already drawn it around
[2:10:01] okay so we're all we're all supposed to
[2:10:04] take her watch myself in the other
[2:10:06] minister we're going to do I think it
[2:10:08] was the first watch so it had been I
[2:10:09] don't know if we started 11 or whatever
[2:10:11] it was it's going to be 11:00 to 2:00
[2:10:14] 12:30 or if we started at 12:00 is going
[2:10:16] to be to 1:30 whatever it was so we're
[2:10:17] there we're taking our watch no watch
[2:10:20] was you know once in a while you shine a
[2:10:22] light so you know you the predators you
[2:10:25] don't actually sleep with them it's not
[2:10:29] recommended you know hey I'm sniffed but
[2:10:33] don't let him sleep
[2:10:34] hey man and so we we did our thing well
[2:10:39] the other guys you Rambo and the other
[2:10:41] guys that are going to take their watch
[2:10:42] they never sleep the entire time they're
[2:10:46] going like this
[2:10:49] all right shot they never sleep they
[2:10:52] were scared so then we we laid on the
[2:10:55] ground to go to sleep and you could hear
[2:10:58] the Lions you can hear the prides
[2:10:59] roaring off in the distance and all that
[2:11:01] and where they get okay maybe eventually
[2:11:02] we're gonna get woke up and hey they're
[2:11:04] here you know they're and well these
[2:11:08] guys they're like this they'll entire
[2:11:10] time we slept we woke up and and Rambo
[2:11:14] told me he said hey while you slept we
[2:11:17] watched a red Roman a red Roman is not a
[2:11:20] spider but it looks like a spider they
[2:11:22] look like huge tarantulas about like
[2:11:24] this big
[2:11:25] he said we watched him crawl right
[2:11:27] towards you and I think he he'd crawl
[2:11:30] and we looked and sure enough you could
[2:11:32] see the tracks came right to here and
[2:11:36] went back so the thing crawled all over
[2:11:39] me so then I'm thinking okay Rambo you
[2:11:45] watch this thing you know what kind of
[2:11:50] test point is that I saw you you had a
[2:11:53] red Roman on you ha ha ha I don't want
[2:11:59] you backing me up I don't care how big
[2:12:02] your knife is I don't care how nice your
[2:12:05] armor is you have not been proven I want
[2:12:09] somebody who's been there somebody knows
[2:12:11] what it's like somebody that can fight
[2:12:14] with you
[2:12:16] I figured out you know you can testify
[2:12:21] all you want in the house meeting but
[2:12:24] when you get out there and you hear the
[2:12:25] lines and you see the elephants and you
[2:12:28] hear the noise and you feel the fear
[2:12:31] it's very scary
[2:12:36] hey man Church we have been called to be
[2:12:40] afraid well I found out that their fear
[2:12:45] ruined the whole experience you know
[2:12:48] fear will ruin a good church service for
[2:12:50] you we went on a walk the next morning
[2:12:55] we could see where the hyenas had come
[2:12:57] in but they wouldn't come in all the way

[2:13:02] is hey man you want a good gospel
[2:13:06] experience get rid of the fear get rid

[2:15:50] thing got angry and it just one twist of
[2:15:54] its neck snapped that animal in half and
[2:15:57] walked off with half of it you see the
[2:16:00] giant you face a men is more than your
[2:16:03] mouth more than your minds more than
[2:16:07] sitting in your easy chair say hey that
[2:16:09] guy's doing the wrong thing it's
[2:16:11] actually participating it's actually
[2:16:13] doing something entering your prayers
[2:16:17] into the event entering your energy into
[2:16:19] the church energy and putting yourself
[2:16:21] into the body and edifying it
[2:16:25] what do we have hey will brother Danny I
[2:16:31] sure glad I'm not in Africa well let me
[2:16:33] tell you what but the devil goes about
[2:16:34] like a roaring lion seeking whom he may
[2:16:37] devour praise the name of the Lord
[2:16:42] brother Branham says amen
[2:16:47] well let me just say we say this first
[2:16:50] before say what brother Branham says
[2:16:52] they're not close and we can maybe pick
[2:16:54] it up at another time whatever we
[2:16:58] accomplished on our own is only a hint
[2:17:01] of what God can do you know why when
[2:17:06] brother BAM spoke about the third pole
[2:17:09] the opening of the word what is the
[2:17:10] opening what does opening mean to you
[2:17:12] every time God opens something it brings
[2:17:14] life brings life brings light and he
[2:17:21] talked he said I had my hands up
[2:17:23] praising the Lord that's why it's good
[2:17:25] to raise your hands up praise the Lord
[2:17:28] didn't have feeble hands hanging down on
[2:17:30] his knees he had his hands up praising
[2:17:32] the Lord and sabino canyon something
[2:17:34] struck his hand and he said he looked at
[2:17:37] it he said it was a sword and I said
[2:17:40] it's a king short and said avoid
[2:17:41] spooking he says not a king it's the
[2:17:42] king the king he said then if it's the
[2:17:48] king sword it's the the sword of the
[2:17:50] king is the word the Lord has put the
[2:17:54] word in your hand see the God doesn't
[2:18:00] argue a man with nothing he armed you
[2:18:03] with his word
[2:18:05] and what you accomplish on your own
[2:18:08] ability is only a hint of what God can
[2:18:12] do so I'll say this when we're weak and
[2:18:17] we don't realize it we feel that void
[2:18:21] with pride and that's the worst
[2:18:23] combination a week and a proud person
[2:18:29] but when you're weak and realize it
[2:18:31] brother Ram said there's so many of us
[2:18:33] like to testify or think that were
[2:18:36] insufficient and we make an excuse I
[2:18:39] have no education I have no ability I'm
[2:18:42] unable to do this he said if you keep
[2:18:45] that up and do that in that way if you
[2:18:47] keep going like that you will amount to
[2:18:49] nothing but the very thing we make
[2:18:53] excuses for our weaknesses God uses that
[2:18:57] very thing to tackle the job with he
[2:19:01] waits for us to get to that condition so
[2:19:05] he can use you glory we take the excuses
[2:19:13] and say I can't do it I'm insufficient I
[2:19:16] can't do it and God takes that very
[2:19:19] thing to do the job with that is true I
[2:19:23] love that because then what does that do
[2:19:26] to this poor weak person all because I
[2:19:28] know then that it wasn't me that done it
[2:19:30] but it was God that done it and I know
[2:19:33] that if it was God that done it it's
[2:19:35] gonna be God that keeps on doing it
[2:19:37] I never saved myself he saved me he'll
[2:19:40] save my children amen let's all stand
[2:19:44] together this should be the name of the
[2:19:46] Lord so don't go out and say I'm tremble
[2:19:54] go out and say I'm a son and daughter of
[2:19:58] God I don't want to be patterned after a
[2:20:01] television star amen
[2:20:07] I find my identity in here then I can
[2:20:13] fight Haman David don't arm yourself and
[2:20:17] don't put on unproven armor put on
[2:20:21] what's been proven I know I never
[2:20:24] scratch the surface of it this morning
[2:20:26] but don't put on something unproven amen
[2:20:30] when when God our excuse me Paul told
[2:20:32] Timothy young man he told him you stay
[2:20:35] there in Ephesus and you tell them not
[2:20:38] to teach these genealogies in these
[2:20:41] fables but to stay with what you've
[2:20:45] already been taught a man he armed him
[2:20:49] with the word and God has armed us stay
[2:20:54] with the word I believe every son and
[2:20:59] daughter of God anointed of the Holy
[2:21:00] Spirit has something in their heart that
[2:21:02] can recognize can recognize when Satan's
[2:21:08] trying to do something I mean if we
[2:21:11] can't let's ask him to help us to do it
[2:21:13] say Lord amen I'm gonna put on what's
[2:21:17] been proven cover myself with what's
[2:21:21] been proven
[2:21:22] and stay right behind me Heavenly Father
[2:21:26] thank you for this day that you have
[2:21:28] given us as David said this is the day
[2:21:30] that the Lord has made I will rejoice
[2:21:33] and be glad in it I pray your arm your
[2:21:36] people may they go out of here armed
[2:21:38] with the Word of God I would not say
[2:21:40] they're not armed they have been armed
[2:21:42] but may they not forget what they armed
[2:21:43] with brother venom said in the greatest
[2:21:45] battle he said Satan if he can get you
[2:21:47] to lay down that sword he's got you
[2:21:49] right there he said if he can get you
[2:21:51] amen to believe that your weapon is only
[2:21:53] equivalent to what Satan is trying to do
[2:21:55] to you it's not stronger amen in the
[2:21:56] situation than Satan's got you right
[2:21:58] there
[2:21:59] Amen but we know Amen we've been
[2:22:01] equipped a man with the Word of God
[2:22:03] we've been equipped with the
[2:22:05] supernatural power of God that equips
[2:22:07] every believer Lord then let us not lean
[2:22:10] to the arm of the flesh
[2:22:11] let us not lean to our own understanding
[2:22:13] let us lean upon yours Lord you know the
[2:22:17] way through the wilderness all we have
[2:22:20] to do is follow Amen then father we
[2:22:23] thank you for that you said in your word
[2:22:26] that your sheep know your voice
[2:22:28] Amen and another they're not follow I
[2:22:31] pray this morning Amen that you're
[2:22:34] strengthened every heart Amen may the
[2:22:37] sick among us say they are healed and
[2:22:40] rejoice in it Lord rejoice Lord for that
[2:22:44] rejoicing in itself works against the
[2:22:47] symptom Satan tries to anoint their mind
[2:22:50] with Oh God
[2:22:52] maybe he'll then firm mine may you heal
[2:22:55] the fear that's in the mind drive it
[2:22:58] away may they not Amen put trust in
[2:23:01] their own abilities and their own way
[2:23:03] they handle things may they put trust in
[2:23:05] you we Lord submit ourselves to your
[2:23:09] leadership thank you father for being
[2:23:12] with us today
[2:23:13] heal the sick encourage each one filled
[2:23:17] with the holy spirit again we ask in
[2:23:19] Jesus name Amen
[2:23:35] praise the name of the Lord and God
[2:23:38] bless our brother amen
[2:23:41] it is a challenge to our faith amen
[2:23:46] and again thank the Lord I trusted that
[2:23:51] God has spoken to our hearts and our
[2:23:53] souls amen
[2:23:56] to chant it to make sure to make our
[2:23:59] call the election short is to make sure
[2:24:01] we have faith and that it is spiritual
[2:24:04] and not intellectual and our brother was
[2:24:07] right in bringing out this side and that
[2:24:10] side this side of that side because no
[2:24:12] matter what God does the enemy is there
[2:24:14] to do this amen no matter what God says
[2:24:17] the enemy is there to add a word or take
[2:24:19] away a word yet God said yeah if God
[2:24:21] said and so on so brother I pray the
[2:24:25] grace of God then we're going to stay
[2:24:27] with my god said we're not going to
[2:24:29] reason with the devil we're not going to
[2:24:30] add to it we're not going to take away
[2:24:32] from it by the grace of God and as he
[2:24:35] said right here we had to stay away from
[2:24:36] negative attitudes what because that
[2:24:39] challenge is your faith that questions
[2:24:41] your faith negative attitudes and where
[2:24:44] does that come from that comes from the
[2:24:45] devil amen oh it's a you know in our
[2:24:48] natural flesh yet it is but they Satan
[2:24:50] that highlights it it's saying that
[2:24:52] where he's working on and he knows he
[2:24:54] knows what's in your flesh he knows the
[2:24:56] weakness that's there he knows what he
[2:24:59] what he needs to use in you he nobody
[2:25:01] needs to use in me and again well we're
[2:25:05] all different when it comes to that
[2:25:06] because you've got this weakness
[2:25:08] somebody else got that weakness and that
[2:25:10] weakness you know us Satan knows he
[2:25:13] definitely knows so whatever your
[2:25:15] weakness is that's what the enemy is
[2:25:16] going to use what for the Challenger
[2:25:19] faith he's going to use it to weaken
[2:25:21] your faith he's going to use it to get
[2:25:23] us out of the spiritual and into the
[2:25:24] intellectual or into into the into the
[2:25:27] physical or into the religious whatever
[2:25:29] but brother has got to be spiritual as
[2:25:32] spiritual is the Holy Ghost
[2:25:34] amen it again it is Christ in me the
[2:25:37] hope of glory
[2:25:38] by the grace of God so brother make sure
[2:25:41] it's Christ in us make sure it's the
[2:25:43] word in us and make sure it's not the
[2:25:45] devil
[2:25:45] a man so whatever that that you feel led
[2:25:49] to do and again brother were sons and
[2:25:51] daughters of God are led by the Spirit
[2:25:54] of God amen we would we live in the
[2:25:57] spirit we walk in the spirit so matter
[2:25:59] what it is so everyday sons and
[2:26:02] daughters of God are led by the Spirit
[2:26:04] of God in every every circumstance in
[2:26:07] every situation led by the spirit a man
[2:26:10] again not me that lives Christ that
[2:26:12] living them is it is it Christ at you in
[2:26:16] in your home it is Christ to you in your
[2:26:19] job you mean to tell me as action
[2:26:22] actually that Jesus is doing that work
[2:26:24] but he's using you to do it oh yeah if
[2:26:29] there's no way there's not one thing if
[2:26:32] you're born truly sincerely honestly
[2:26:35] born again there's nothing you do
[2:26:38] yourself it's you live you it's his
[2:26:42] choices it's his assistance it's this
[2:26:44] knowledge is this wisdom
[2:26:46] it's his leadership a man again boy
[2:26:49] because it's not me that lives this
[2:26:51] Christ to live within me I pray God that
[2:26:54] then what we have heard tonight will gel
[2:26:56] challenge us in all that we experience
[2:26:59] it would challenge us in all that we do
[2:27:02] amen as the sons and daughters of God
[2:27:05] are we led by the Spirit of God as sons
[2:27:10] and daughters of God are we controlled
[2:27:12] by the Spirit of God amen not the devil
[2:27:16] not feelings but faith amen what is your
[2:27:21] faith producing our brother brought this
[2:27:24] out
[2:27:24] is it the results of the mental faith or
[2:27:28] is it the results of a spiritual faith
[2:27:31] amen and again in a message that I was I
[2:27:35] lady there in the last service than the
[2:27:37] service before the public God brings it
[2:27:39] out and he challenging even even Brenham
[2:27:42] tabernacle why because he felt that UE
[2:27:45] said you got a mental
[2:27:47] but not a spiritual faith even random
[2:27:49] tabernacle so where does mental faith
[2:27:52] come from it is the devil it is not God
[2:27:56] no no it is Satan is working on working
[2:27:59] in our flesh and he's taking what God
[2:28:01] gives us in the spirit and I put it
[2:28:03] putting it into our minds and into our
[2:28:05] flesh and helping and getting us to
[2:28:07] understand oh this is your faith this is
[2:28:09] faith this is faith oh that's your faith
[2:28:11] now faith that comes right back to the
[2:28:13] word the whole truth nothing but the
[2:28:15] truth
[2:28:16] amen so brother what is your faith
[2:28:20] producing is it mental faith or
[2:28:22] spiritual faith a man it's good but the
[2:28:27] thing but the the thing it is can you
[2:28:30] answer the question and can you answer
[2:28:33] it sincerely
[2:28:34] and honestly amen
[2:28:37] the devil's get you is there to get you
[2:28:40] to lie like Eve yeah when when Adam was
[2:28:44] challenging Eve oh no she said but she
[2:28:49] said this is good for this good for this
[2:28:50] good for that and well I told you that's
[2:28:52] mental faith that's right not spiritual
[2:28:56] so I pray God that we're going to be
[2:29:00] sincere and honest before God regarding
[2:29:03] the faith that we say that we have let's
[2:29:08] make sure it's spiritual and if it's
[2:29:10] spiritual it just gives God the
[2:29:12] preeminence Lord not me it's you what is
[2:29:16] it what is your will what is it you want
[2:29:17] me to do lord grace amen so brother
[2:29:23] sister let's make sure that we are
[2:29:26] living in the spirit walking to the
[2:29:27] spirit controlled by the Holy Spirit not
[2:29:31] the Holy Spirit and remember again the
[2:29:35] prophet of God warned us concerning
[2:29:38] their that Jesus and the devil he said
[2:29:41] our twins in the same church oh yeah one
[2:29:46] is Christ the other is Antichrist a man
[2:29:49] but they're twins in the same church so
[2:29:52] brother God have mercy God help us to be
[2:29:56] more sincere and more honest with God
[2:30:01] remember everything is coming down to
[2:30:04] the challenge of our faith everything is
[2:30:07] coming to that place a man and it's
[2:30:10] going to it's going to manifest and
[2:30:11] reveal our faith it's going to prove
[2:30:14] whether it's spiritual or whether it's
[2:30:17] intellectual and again as I said the
[2:30:20] Prophet brought it out and he really put
[2:30:22] a hard emphasis on it
[2:30:24] he said the trouble today his people he
[2:30:26] said got too much mental faith and not
[2:30:29] spiritual a man it's all in their heads
[2:30:32] but not in their hearts if it's in your
[2:30:35] heart it controls you yeah morning noon
[2:30:39] and night it controls you thought word
[2:30:41] and deed and you're led by the Spirit of
[2:30:45] God amen if it's in your head you're led
[2:30:48] by this you can be led by the spirit the
[2:30:50] devil and remember he's so close so
[2:30:55] close so close it would deceive the very
[2:30:58] elect oh well I won't be deceive no
[2:31:04] because you think you because of your
[2:31:05] knowledge you won't be deceived or it
[2:31:07] can't be your feelings
[2:31:08] st. no use your feelings snake me use
[2:31:11] your reasoning no you're gonna cast it
[2:31:14] down what what well your faith constant
[2:31:19] well I believe this I believe this that
[2:31:21] no way comes down to it is written thus
[2:31:27] saith the Lord no question no feelings
[2:31:31] no no what do you live in my well it's
[2:31:34] written and again there are a brother
[2:31:37] bottle doubt concerning humility but you
[2:31:42] went you're going to have that almost
[2:31:43] spirit amen I pulled it from the from
[2:31:47] the message on on humility that the
[2:31:50] Prophet preached and you have to humble
[2:31:52] yourself and brother all the sons and
[2:31:55] daughters of God are humble they're not
[2:31:58] there to push that lift themselves up to
[2:32:01] Allah and you exalt themselves or oh I'm
[2:32:03] this and I'm that I'm gonna do this
[2:32:04] y'all we think we're doing this dude
[2:32:06] this old God's gotta be pleased no what
[2:32:10] pleases God is your humility
[2:32:12] yeah oh yeah there are those that that
[2:32:18] will do this will do that but yet they
[2:32:20] don't have the the love of God oh yeah
[2:32:25] God's not there to to think God is not
[2:32:28] pleased no see you if you want to play
[2:32:33] please go on
[2:32:34] oh well I gotta do this I gotta do this
[2:32:35] to please God yeah but you got to do
[2:32:37] with a right attitude you got to have a
[2:32:39] right spirit you got to have a right
[2:32:41] motive you got to have a right objective
[2:32:43] it's got to be God in you doing it not
[2:32:47] you based on your knowledge based on
[2:32:50] your feelings based on your
[2:32:52] understanding no it's got to be God in
[2:32:54] you you're led by the Holy Spirit
[2:32:56] well he's right your brother really
[2:32:59] brought it out then what you do it's got
[2:33:03] to be the God in you and what you do
[2:33:05] it's got to be a right attitude on the
[2:33:07] right spirit a man by the grace of God
[2:33:16] it is the danger as he preached of
[2:33:20] unproven armor yeah it's got to be
[2:33:24] proven by the grace of God it might work
[2:33:27] for Saul but it would it would work for
[2:33:29] David no not by any means David was
[2:33:34] going by faith amen and yeah and faith
[2:33:39] now that's something else - we're going
[2:33:42] David and Goliath how do you know he's
[2:33:47] gone by faith when he went when he went
[2:33:49] to fight Goliath he talked about the
[2:33:53] lion and the bear and so on but when he
[2:33:58] when he when he challenged when to
[2:33:59] challenge Daliah what did he highlight
[2:34:04] to the Israeli soldiers what did he eye
[2:34:07] light - Saul the King it was a spiritual
[2:34:11] revelation that they never considered
[2:34:16] just saying all these Israeli soldiers
[2:34:19] and the end and all my those in charge
[2:34:22] never considered just think they were
[2:34:24] Israelis they were Jew
[2:34:28] but they were afraid of Goliath what
[2:34:35] afraid of Goliath all them soldiers yeah
[2:34:39] and here comes this young man David just
[2:34:44] a shepherd boy and he said Goliath you
[2:34:51] know he said you're you what's going on
[2:34:54] here he said when he came to and to meet
[2:34:57] his brothers there and to give them the
[2:34:59] food and so on and and he noticed they
[2:35:01] were all there and and there's just this
[2:35:03] one man there he said what's going on oh
[2:35:08] yeah he's challenging us that if we if
[2:35:12] we defeat him then you know that all the
[2:35:16] others are going to submit to us and he
[2:35:18] said what are you afraid of nobody going
[2:35:21] down there and I guess the most of all
[2:35:24] laughing at David that maybe others were
[2:35:27] criticizing David pretty girl of David
[2:35:29] putting him down yeah what was there why
[2:35:34] because of his faith faith no gave it
[2:35:41] listen David even though y'all did you
[2:35:44] God get delivered the lion God delivered
[2:35:46] to bear to you and all that but this is
[2:35:49] this is Goliath you know any and he sees
[2:35:51] he's so he's over nine nine feet I think
[2:35:55] it was over nine feet tall and David
[2:35:58] David was just a young boy maybe not
[2:36:00] fully grown yet and he said but he
[2:36:04] wasn't afraid of him well the King
[2:36:07] thought well no well maybe he was just
[2:36:09] for his conscience sake what David I'll
[2:36:12] give you the issue you take my armor and
[2:36:14] go down and fight and if you're gonna do
[2:36:15] that and they just tried it on that
[2:36:19] didn't work there's no way he said not
[2:36:22] used to this he just threw it off and
[2:36:25] what did he do he went down to the river
[2:36:27] and he picked up five stones grace yeah
[2:36:34] but where was his faith his faith was in
[2:36:41] the promise of God to the Jews and it
[2:36:48] was in the token of the Covenant she was
[2:36:55] shunned order is the patent the latest
[2:36:58] the token you mean to tell me all those
[2:37:04] Jews never recognized that Goliath never
[2:37:08] had the token and yet here comes this
[2:37:16] young boy this shepherd boy whom they
[2:37:18] consider to be stupid
[2:37:21] no one did didn't know anything and then
[2:37:23] you know they didn't consider him to be
[2:37:25] big or important and there he had no
[2:37:30] fear whatsoever just thinking that he
[2:37:34] had no fear all the others were fearful
[2:37:37] frightened to death of July where David
[2:37:42] come you see what's going on he was so
[2:37:47] relaxed and I've been asking questions
[2:37:53] just the last few days Chris Ernie
[2:37:56] fasting no he got a pass you got a fast
[2:38:00] and there are those that see oh you've
[2:38:02] got a fast well probably God didn't he
[2:38:05] said well probably God only fast I think
[2:38:07] it's three days the most but I think he
[2:38:11] fasted less and less as he came to the
[2:38:13] end of his ministry and all he got a
[2:38:17] fast you got a fast no David didn't fast
[2:38:20] and kill the lion he didn't fast and
[2:38:23] killed a bear and he did know he know he
[2:38:26] didn't had the fast and killed in fact
[2:38:28] he would bring a food and that thinks to
[2:38:30] his to his brothers and to kill Goliath
[2:38:33] know what ye means
[2:38:40] because what was the token circumcision
[2:38:46] physical fleshly circumcision the Jews
[2:38:49] added but Goliath never added and he
[2:38:54] challenged them based on that on the
[2:38:56] token he said why are you so fearful of
[2:38:59] this uncircumcised Philistine was that
[2:39:05] God doing it was the Covenant the token
[2:39:10] of the Covenant and he doesn't have it
[2:39:12] therefore God is not with him cause not
[2:39:18] going to defend him God is going to give
[2:39:20] us the victory over him what faith what
[2:39:23] faith God airp us that we'd have that
[2:39:28] faith they've got no question that faith
[2:39:31] they got no doubt and and made all the
[2:39:35] Israel maybe was frightened to death and
[2:39:37] they were nervous Oh old David Oh David
[2:39:39] oh don't do that don't do that you know
[2:39:41] you don't have to do it you know he
[2:39:44] wasn't nervous he wasn't afraid he just
[2:39:48] went down with his slingshot
[2:39:49] picked up the five stones and he said go
[2:39:52] at he said God's going to deliver you
[2:39:54] into my hands he was going to cut his
[2:39:56] head off
[2:39:57] yeah they were afraid he's gonna cut
[2:39:59] David say Oh No
[2:40:00] David was gonna do it to him yeah why
[2:40:05] David knew God was with him because he
[2:40:09] was in the Covenant and he had the
[2:40:11] circumcision he had the token of the
[2:40:13] Covenant amen amen
[2:40:17] do we have the token of the Covenant of
[2:40:20] our Lord Jesus Christ the life of his
[2:40:22] blood in us if you got the token in your
[2:40:28] heart in your soul you got you are more
[2:40:34] than a copper
[2:40:37] David was more than a conquerer they
[2:40:40] were all behind him but here he was
[2:40:44] Davis conqueror was in his heart in his
[2:40:47] soul the anointing was with David praise
[2:40:50] the name of the Lord I pray please in
[2:40:54] the name of God in the name of the Lord
[2:40:56] Jesus Christ please let's have that
[2:40:59] faith that spiritual faith that has no
[2:41:03] question no doubt whatsoever
[2:41:05] our president brought it out he said you
[2:41:07] would you think this and that but it
[2:41:09] there's not faith you're thinking that
[2:41:11] but it's not that you feel this you feel
[2:41:13] that but no faith got nothing to do with
[2:41:15] that faith just believes God get please
[2:41:19] just trust the Lord believes the word it
[2:41:22] yeah it is written and they again don't
[2:41:26] doubt God help us just there's hardly a
[2:41:30] day but we'll go by what we need it is
