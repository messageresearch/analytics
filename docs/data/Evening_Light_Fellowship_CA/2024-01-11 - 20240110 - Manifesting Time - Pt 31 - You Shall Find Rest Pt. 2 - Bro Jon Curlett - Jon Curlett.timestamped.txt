[36:27] Lord we're looking for a rapturing Faith
[36:29] Lord we're not just looking for a saving
[36:31] Faith Lord but we're looking for a

[36:35] take us out of this pest house and take
[36:37] us into a glorified body and Lord to do
[36:40] that we know you're going to conquer
[36:42] every bit that holds us back lord there
[36:45] will be nothing left when we're done
[36:47] lord it's just a body change that we
[36:49] need Lord so I pray you give us Victory
[36:51] this evening Lord help us to yield help
[36:53] us to Humble help us to just trust and
[36:55] believe Lord your word and let it do its
[36:57] work in our life we pray Lord may we
[37:00] yield to your Holy Spirit we ask in
[37:02] Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen
[37:05] God bless you turn if you would to
[37:07] Joshua
[37:08] 21 Joshua 21 and certainly glad to have
[37:12] sister Rebecca back with us and sister J
[37:14] Justine's not here but they both made it
[37:16] back safely from their trip abroad and
[37:19] so we're glad to see that and then we
[37:20] have sister Priscilla and brother Joe
[37:23] heading out early early tomorrow morning
[37:25] so we want to certainly remember
[37:26] remember them as they leave us for 5
[37:29] weeks and just trusting God's grace that
[37:31] he'll bless them and make them a
[37:32] blessing amen everywhere we go it's good
[37:34] to give and it's good to get amen so
[37:36] trusting the Lord will bless them as
[37:38] they spend some time with her family
[37:40] down there spoke with brother Grant on
[37:42] Sunday evening I believe and he let me
[37:44] know that his manager and his and uh
[37:47] that man's wife and child will be in
[37:48] service on Sunday so we want to remember
[37:51] that service in particular knowing that
[37:53] there's going to be people coming in
[37:54] gives me an opportunity to maybe study a
[37:57] different way so just praying that God
[37:59] would speak to them amen not everyone
[38:01] that comes in is of it amen not everyone
[38:03] that hears the word is it but we're a
[38:05] small group and a small place and I'm
[38:07] just trusting that as we witness to
[38:09] people and as we're lights to people
[38:11] that we get new Souls amen that we get
[38:13] new converts that it's not just us for
[38:15] and no more and ones that are the
[38:17] original group here and that but that
[38:19] that the Lord will bring in Lost Souls
[38:21] amen and I know many of us have had many
[38:22] opportunities Selena was talking the
[38:25] other day and she had an appointment and
[38:26] she talked with this woman for an hour
[38:28] and a half and she said I don't know
[38:29] what happened I don't know how we got
[38:30] there and I said I had specifically
[38:32] prayed for her and sister Justine and
[38:34] our young people that they would be
[38:36] Witnesses and all of a sudden the
[38:38] opportunity presents itself and so I
[38:40] believe it's for the young people it's
[38:41] for the middle-aged it's for the old
[38:43] wherever we go amen we're supposed to be
[38:45] a witness and a testimony I believe if
[38:46] we've got a heart that wants to bring
[38:48] souls to Christ then he'll give us
[38:50] opportunities to do exactly that amen so
[38:53] just trusting God to be with us each one
[38:55] as they go each one as they come in that
[38:57] the Lord will sort it out amen we put
[38:58] those things in his hand and just trust
[39:00] if if nothing else that he'll save a
[39:02] soul amen amen Joshua 21 and beautiful
[39:06] portion of scripture here 21 and 43 says
[39:08] and the lord gave unto Israel all the
[39:11] land which he swear to give unto their
[39:13] fathers and they possessed it and dwelt
[39:16] therein and the lord gave them rest
[39:18] round about according to all that he
[39:20] swear unto their fathers and there stood
[39:22] not a man of all their enemies before
[39:24] them the Lord delivered all all their
[39:27] enemies into their hands you notice
[39:29] God's the only one that can do
[39:30] superlatives absolutes every all never
[39:36] that's what God does he deals with
[39:38] absolutes and he's saying here
[39:39] everything that I said I've given you it
[39:43] says he delivered all their enemies into
[39:45] their hand there failed not ought that
[39:48] means there not a single thing failed of
[39:50] any good thing which the Lord had spoken
[39:53] unto the house of Israel all came to
[39:56] pass amen God bless you you can have
[39:58] your seats this evening and we're
[40:00] continuing on this thought in our series
[40:02] on manifesting time and I'm taking a
[40:04] second service on this thought of you
[40:05] shall find rest and there's a lot to
[40:08] cover here and I know we'll get through
[40:10] what we have today because I'm not going
[40:11] to be too long by God's grace but I I I
[40:14] want to maybe step into the Practical a
[40:16] little bit this this afternoon and this
[40:18] evening and you know me it's uh you know
[40:20] like like like the saying is we don't
[40:21] want to be so spiritual we're of no
[40:23] earthly good and sometimes we read the
[40:25] Bible and everything's for the future
[40:26] future and everything's for when we get
[40:27] on the other side and everything's for
[40:29] this and for that and all of a sudden
[40:30] we've got no victory in our life amen
[40:32] but I want to bring it right down where
[40:33] we live but I want to start with I what
[40:35] I consider to be a supernatural quote
[40:37] and it's the last thing that we read in
[40:38] our in our service on Sunday brother
[40:41] Bram said this he says it's written over
[40:42] in St John about the 15th chapter if you
[40:45] abide in me and my word in you see the
[40:48] word abides in you see then ask what you
[40:51] will and it'll be done because it's not
[40:53] you it's the word that's in you that
[40:56] takes takes all the pressure off of us
[40:58] that all we have to do is get into the
[41:00] word and the word has to get into us and
[41:01] that's what settles the situation we
[41:03] don't have to come up with some big
[41:05] theology some big idea but rather we
[41:07] have to let him do something inside of
[41:09] us and then he takes care of everything
[41:11] from that point on he says the word is
[41:13] God see it's God in you God's the word
[41:16] because in the beginning was the word
[41:17] the word was with God the Word was God
[41:20] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[41:22] Among Us he says now in the return of
[41:24] the Holy Spirit bringing the word in us
[41:28] and abiding in there abiding in there
[41:31] staying in there once you're sealed it's
[41:33] a finished work and he never leaves you
[41:35] can't lose it he can't take it back it's
[41:37] his certification on our soul it seals
[41:40] us to the day of our Redemption it says
[41:42] and it abiding in there then it's not
[41:44] you that speaks it's the word itself
[41:46] coming out so it the word will perform
[41:50] the work and there's a great rest that
[41:52] we have and it's not in who we are it's
[41:54] not in our skills our gifts our min
[41:56] Ministries our callings it's not our
[41:57] strength it's not our family name our
[42:00] Good Deeds none of these are where our
[42:01] rest is as we covered last service just
[42:03] doing a a quick summary here amen it's
[42:06] not when we have money in the bank and
[42:08] clothes on our back and and we've got
[42:09] Health in our bodies that's not our rest
[42:11] but our rest is that there's something
[42:13] greater that's come that overrides all
[42:15] of those things amen that we have one
[42:17] who watches over us who's who who stays
[42:19] closer than a brother he's greater than
[42:21] us he's our peace he's our rest he's the
[42:23] accepted one he's the powerful one as we
[42:25] read last last service he has all the
[42:28] attributes that we need and so our rest
[42:30] is in him not in ourselves because we ha
[42:33] we need what he has and no matter how
[42:35] much I have of what he has he has more
[42:37] than I do in my natural I might have
[42:40] intelligence I might have discipline I
[42:41] might have strength but compared to God
[42:43] I have nothing and so we're looking to
[42:45] him to come into our lives and bring us
[42:47] into into what we have need of amen and
[42:49] I believe any real believer has learned
[42:51] already that we have is what we have is
[42:53] Never Enough in in ourselves amen there
[42:56] comes up time and that's usually what
[42:57] happens is we say I've tried hard enough
[42:59] and I'm going to let God start doing it
[43:01] and all of a sudden things start to
[43:02] happen because we've taken our hands off
[43:04] the whe amen and where do we find that
[43:06] we find our rest in the word of God
[43:08] brother Brandon we read that quote he
[43:09] says our rest is right here our rest is
[43:11] what God has said because what God says
[43:14] has to come to pass God's immutable he
[43:16] doesn't change his nature doesn't change
[43:18] his word doesn't change his ways don't
[43:20] change and so our rest is first and
[43:21] foremost in that and it tells us who we
[43:24] are it tells us what we are tells us
[43:25] where came from tells us where we're
[43:27] going tells us how we're going to get
[43:29] there and it tells us everything he's
[43:30] given us to make that Journey safely all
[43:32] the way through to Eternity amen this
[43:35] word has everything we need but it's
[43:37] only a letter right
[43:39] here that's where our faith rests
[43:41] initially but there's a rest that has to
[43:43] come and where does it comes it comes
[43:45] the first time when God makes his word
[43:47] real in your life where you take his
[43:49] promise and you step on it and you you
[43:51] stand on it and you believe on it and
[43:53] you apply it and you wait on it and then
[43:55] God does it and that's when you get rest
[43:57] there's a labor there's a battle there
[43:59] to hold fast and see the salvation of
[44:01] God see his word come to pass and then
[44:03] when he's done it then you have this
[44:05] wonderful rest and you're like it's true
[44:08] he's real he cares about me he he he
[44:12] stands behind his word he doesn't leave
[44:14] us hanging though he terries yet he'll
[44:16] come through the word will come to pass
[44:18] in our lives amen and so that's only for
[44:21] the one situation and maybe you you you
[44:23] you had a financial need maybe you
[44:25] needed a job maybe you you had a loved
[44:27] one that that needed salvation and
[44:29] you've waited and you've waited and
[44:30] you've you've held your peace and you've
[44:31] done everything you can and then it
[44:33] happens but that's just one situation
[44:36] what happens the next day another
[44:38] situation pops up and now you got a
[44:40] financial need now you got a health need
[44:41] now you've got a relationship need now
[44:43] you got a church need now whatever it
[44:45] might be put yourself there and what do
[44:47] you got to do you got to go back in the
[44:48] word because you believed it once and it
[44:51] worked and you go back and you find your
[44:52] place again and say Here's the answer to
[44:54] my need and you stay there and what is
[44:56] it you fight to rest until he brings it
[44:59] to pass and then when he brings it to
[45:01] pass now you've got a refreshing his
[45:03] word is still the same he's still the
[45:04] same he still he still backs his promise
[45:07] up and really what it's doing is God
[45:08] building you up in the faith little by
[45:10] little here little there a little
[45:12] precept upon precept and he's getting
[45:14] you to believe bigger and bigger things
[45:17] the first things are for you and it's
[45:19] for your salvation and that's a
[45:21] supernatural event and you can't see it
[45:22] you know something's changed but then he
[45:25] starts to work in the natural doesn't he
[45:27] and now he starts to work on healing and
[45:28] he starts to work on the people around
[45:30] you and then he starts to use you for
[45:32] other people and now you have faith not
[45:34] just for yourself but others and there's
[45:36] a rest that God's going to do a work in
[45:37] them the same way he did a work inside
[45:39] of you so the rest is the first time he
[45:42] does it and we said last time that it's
[45:44] the Dynamics of the word that gives you
[45:46] rest it's when the word becomes a
[45:48] reality when the Holy Spirit quickens
[45:50] and makes it live inside of your life
[45:52] and then the refreshing is when he keeps
[45:53] doing it and he keeps quickening the
[45:55] word to you and he keeps fulfilling it
[45:57] and manifesting it in your life brother
[45:59] B says it this way he says what do you
[46:00] have to
[46:02] do what's your job it's in your title
[46:06] believer he says believe hear Faith
[46:09] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[46:12] word but it doesn't stop there he says
[46:14] hearing and then he says and believing
[46:17] and
[46:18] applying and resting you hear it you
[46:22] believe it you apply it and then you
[46:25] rest amen that's our part believe apply
[46:28] and rest he says you see it the word
[46:30] says so hear it your heart says so
[46:33] believe it he says and your whole being
[46:36] rests in it it's finished amen if it's
[46:39] will in your heart and you really
[46:41] believe it then your whole being can now
[46:43] be brought subject to Faith because
[46:45] that's what's coming out of your soul
[46:46] that's what's coming out of your heart
[46:48] and it brings your spirit realm into
[46:49] subjection and then it'll bring your
[46:51] body into subjection he says and
[46:53] solemnly the believer must rest his
[46:55] faith upon God's word and faith cannot
[46:58] find its resting place upon the shifting
[47:00] Sands of man's theology it's God to take
[47:04] its every stand church if there's a hill
[47:08] to die on it's the word of God not your
[47:11] emotions not your opinions not what your
[47:13] family thinks not what your boss thinks
[47:15] not how bad your financial situation is
[47:17] not how bad your health is you stand on
[47:20] God's word every time he says it's got
[47:23] to take its every stand on the unmoving
[47:25] able Rock of God's Eternal Word God said
[47:28] so that settles it and if he's God he
[47:31] has to keep his word if he doesn't keep
[47:34] his word catch this then he isn't God
[47:37] now that's not true is it that can never
[47:39] be true he says or this isn't his word
[47:43] sometimes we die on a hill because it's
[47:45] not his word and it doesn't happen and
[47:47] we say what happened you didn't catch it
[47:49] the way he meant it or your motive and
[47:50] your objective wasn't quite right but
[47:53] God never fails and his word never fails
[47:55] amen so this rest this refreshing is
[47:58] when the words made alive and our
[47:59] mechanics are our faith and our belief
[48:02] and our Doctrine and what we know in
[48:03] these things we believe what it says but
[48:05] the Dynamics is when it's alive when it
[48:07] becomes real to us when it's made
[48:09] manifest and it's the working of the
[48:11] holy spirit in each and every one of our
[48:13] Lives amen it's when the word becomes
[48:15] alive in us when it becomes alive in you
[48:17] when it becomes alive in me and it's a
[48:19] Living Word not just a letter word
[48:21] letter word kills and what happens is
[48:23] people go to war on the letter word
[48:25] because they don't have the Living Word
[48:27] am me the Living Word will help you
[48:29] remember what Jesus said after the first
[48:31] or second admonition Walk Away We ought
[48:33] not to have running feuds with people
[48:36] with brothers and sisters or churches or
[48:37] Ministries if there's not agreement just
[48:39] walk away and if you're wrong God will
[48:41] correct you and if they're wrong God
[48:42] will correct them but we ought not to
[48:44] beat each other up over these things
[48:46] amen but when we talking about Dynamics
[48:48] it means that reading the Bible is not
[48:50] enough you've got to do it you've got to
[48:52] understand amen coming to church and
[48:54] hearing preaching is good but it's not
[48:56] enough that's the start but it's not the
[48:58] Finish we can sit here and listen to me
[49:00] preach all day till I'm blue in the face
[49:02] and it'll produce nothing but a mess if
[49:04] that's where it ends amen we've got to
[49:06] move beyond the preaching of the word
[49:09] otherwise it causes separation and
[49:11] Discord and clicks and we've seen all
[49:12] these things because man gets involved
[49:14] and we twist things up amen but what it
[49:16] means is we've got to have that
[49:18] face-to-face experience that brother
[49:19] Bram talked about in the last service
[49:21] amen where we know that God is real that
[49:23] we've met him face to face that know
[49:25] he's called us he's put our name in the
[49:27] Lamb's Book of Life and he's placed us
[49:29] on the road to Eternity and he sealed us
[49:31] with the Holy Ghost that's what we need
[49:34] to have each and every one amen we've
[49:35] got to come to the place where we say I
[49:38] know my God is real I know his word is
[49:42] true I know he backs it up and I know
[49:44] that I can rest on it because it's a
[49:46] never failing word and he's a never
[49:48] failing God Amen and we've got to get
[49:50] into the presence of God for that to
[49:52] happen as we we talked about last
[49:54] service and that's why we come to church
[49:56] many times because if I have his
[49:58] presence in my life by the Holy Spirit
[50:00] and you bring it and we all come
[50:01] together instead of one bit of fire we
[50:03] got a lot of fire and that creates an
[50:05] atmosphere for birth that creates an
[50:07] atmosphere for the supernatural to
[50:09] happen amen it brings God on the scene
[50:11] as we come in here and we invite him
[50:12] here we're not coming to he brother John
[50:15] we're coming here for the Lord to speak
[50:16] however he would speak it may be through
[50:19] brother Bob or brother Josh song leading
[50:21] and God can touch you through a song
[50:23] somebody can sing an anointed special
[50:26] and it brings healing it brings
[50:27] restitution it brings rest all of these
[50:30] things or it can come through the
[50:31] preaching of the word or sometimes it's
[50:34] just in the Simplicity of a prayer that
[50:36] comes over this Pulpit but it's God that
[50:38] we come here to see it's God that we
[50:40] come to hear amen it's not brothers and
[50:42] sisters of like Precious Faith amen his
[50:44] presence is what makes the difference
[50:46] here and if he's not here all we've got
[50:48] is a denomination all we've got dead
[50:50] religion all we've got is a church and
[50:51] that's not going to take us anywhere
[50:53] amen we come here to experience his
[50:56] presence remember I read that quote a
[50:57] few Services ago where brother Bram says
[50:59] I only come to church for one reason and
[51:01] that's to be in his presence that's the
[51:04] only thing that matters brother bam he's
[51:07] speaking here of the holy of holies
[51:08] where the Ark of the Covenant was and
[51:10] he's saying notice in this place there
[51:12] they brought Aaron's rod and they laid
[51:14] it there one
[51:18] night one night one experience with the
[51:22] Living God will change us church he says
[51:24] and think that same Rob what did it do
[51:27] in one night it budded it blossomed and
[51:31] yielded almonds in the same night it's a
[51:34] dead stick separated we've been
[51:36] separated from God haven't we we were
[51:38] separated by sin we were separated from
[51:39] unbelief we were separated by ignorance
[51:42] but as soon as we get joined back to
[51:44] that vine what happens life comes in and
[51:47] life yields fruit amen the fruits of the
[51:51] Holy Spirit have to be inside of our
[51:52] lives he says in one night a dead stick
[51:55] in the presence of God it budded so it
[51:58] brought forth the little bits of leaves
[52:00] the leaves opened up it blossomed and
[52:02] then it brought forth fruit in one
[52:04] single night 12 hours it says what was
[52:07] it it must have come off an almond tree
[52:09] and there's a many almond tree are staff
[52:11] tonight but the only thing of it is as
[52:14] long as you're outside of this hidden
[52:15] life you'll never be able to be
[52:17] refreshed and bring forth the fruits
[52:19] that God intended you to do until you
[52:21] come into the presence of God that's
[52:24] what it takes it takes a personal
[52:26] entrance into the presence of God he
[52:29] says look at it the
[52:32] budding we can get there we go the first
[52:35] thing we find out what makes trees bud
[52:38] it's a refreshment what makes the
[52:40] refreshing he says early of a morning
[52:42] you go out of an early morning and you
[52:44] find out after the night that everything
[52:46] gets still and then the Dew Falls and it
[52:49] brings a refreshing and the trouble of
[52:52] it is today the people don't have time
[52:55] to get before God and get
[52:58] still they've got so many things to do
[53:02] now catch this they belong to this they
[53:06] got to do this they got to have this and
[53:09] they got to go there he says you don't
[53:11] have time the Devils just took up all
[53:13] your time you don't have time to get
[53:16] still before God and get quiet church if
[53:18] we are so busy we don't have time for
[53:20] God that means we're not busy with what
[53:22] God wants us to
[53:23] do I can't say it any planer amen if you
[53:27] don't have time for God then you can't
[53:29] be doing God's will because the first
[53:31] thing he seeks is relationship and
[53:32] fellowship with you it's not works it's
[53:35] time oneon-one
[53:38] amen I don't want my wife to just clean
[53:40] the
[53:41] house I want to spend one-on-one time
[53:43] with her I want to have quiet time I
[53:46] want to have quality time with her amen
[53:49] otherwise it's a business transaction
[53:51] it's a business relationship and that's
[53:52] not what marriage is I can hire somebody
[53:55] to do that but I marry somebody for the
[53:57] relationship and that's what he wants
[53:58] from us brother R says there's four
[54:00] things that tie us up and take away our
[54:02] rest he says belong to something you
[54:05] know what happens when you belong to
[54:06] something other people put their
[54:08] expectations on
[54:10] you and that's not always a bad thing
[54:13] but if you're bound by other people's
[54:15] expectations it'll take you to a place
[54:17] God doesn't expect you to be then he
[54:19] says you've got to do something and my
[54:22] question is this says who who says you
[54:24] got to do anything if the word says it
[54:28] that's fine but if somebody else is
[54:30] telling me I got to do this and I got to
[54:32] be here and do that says
[54:34] who as brother Joe's been telling me
[54:36] you're not my
[54:38] boss right so often what we let is
[54:42] ourselves get L around by the nose by
[54:44] other people's opinions on what we're
[54:46] supposed to be
[54:47] doing I remember way back when and
[54:50] forgive me I don't mean to bring humor
[54:52] over the pulpit but remember there was
[54:55] there was this lady and she was talking
[54:57] about the bed checking
[54:59] police and we act as if everything has
[55:01] to be perfect all the time including our
[55:04] beds being made at all times lest
[55:06] somebody realize we didn't make our bed
[55:08] today what does it matter if we don't
[55:10] make our bed today sisters is there a
[55:13] Bed checking police squad going house to
[55:15] house checking if we made our bed today
[55:17] did we vacuum our floors did we did we
[55:20] clean the counters is everything perfect
[55:22] no it doesn't matter at the end of the
[55:24] day whether we make our bed it's a
[55:26] matter of Pride it's a matter of Good
[55:27] Housekeeping I understand that but in
[55:29] the end ain't no bed checking police
[55:31] coming into our house if you I I I if
[55:35] you don't make your bed and you spend
[55:37] some time with God in its place that's a
[55:39] good
[55:40] trade-off what is it we put these
[55:42] expectations on oursel of perfection and
[55:45] everywhere else and yet somehow we don't
[55:47] expect perfection in terms of our
[55:49] relationship with God and our time with
[55:51] God how twisted do we get this is the
[55:54] subtlety of of Satan is he gets us so
[55:56] bound up in what we belong to we've got
[55:59] to do something he says we've got to
[56:01] have
[56:02] something says who is it a need or is it
[56:06] a
[56:07] want sometimes we're so focused on
[56:09] getting something that we don't realize
[56:11] that we're missing the very thing that
[56:12] we have that we ought to have or it's
[56:14] available to us right now I've always
[56:16] told my wife I said when I'm looking to
[56:19] buy something big it's because my
[56:20] relationship with God has cooled
[56:22] off you know why cuz I'm seeking
[56:25] satisfaction and guess what whether I
[56:27] buy the car whether I buy the gun
[56:29] whether I buy the hockey stick whatever
[56:30] it might be that's just a placebo
[56:33] because I'm not close to God and I've
[56:36] told her I've told her that I said when
[56:37] you look at me looking at Big purchases
[56:39] it means that something's cooled off
[56:41] when I'm pushing for it I'm always
[56:44] looking because I'm always looking for
[56:45] deals but when I'm pushing for it it
[56:47] usually means that I've lost my
[56:48] satisfaction somewhere else but we can
[56:51] get to the point where we're so
[56:52] interested in what we're got to get
[56:55] that we've forgotten what we're supposed
[56:56] to have at all times amen what really
[56:58] matters amen this is the age of
[57:01] materialism absolutely everybody wants
[57:03] the latest thing and people are are are
[57:05] driving themselves into debt to have
[57:07] things that they don't actually need we
[57:10] need to ask ourselves do we need it or
[57:11] do we want it then he says we've got to
[57:14] go somewhere always going never stopping
[57:18] go go go go go and I've got a quote for
[57:20] you on people that always go amen but
[57:22] this is something that the Lord's had to
[57:24] work with me on even being a pastor I've
[57:26] got a full-time job and I've got a
[57:27] full-time job and you know what I've had
[57:29] to let go of things at work and I've got
[57:31] to let go of things as a pastor because
[57:33] I've I've got to realize that I don't
[57:35] have to do everything for everybody I
[57:37] might be capable of doing everything
[57:39] that that people ask but that doesn't
[57:41] mean I have to do it sometimes people
[57:43] are perfectly capable of doing it
[57:45] themselves and sometimes they need to do
[57:47] it themselves so they can learn and
[57:48] mature and grow but then we've got
[57:50] deacons and trustees and able-bodied
[57:52] people all over this church that can
[57:53] help relieve the burden from for certain
[57:55] things and God's helping me to really
[57:57] taper that down because I've got to have
[57:59] time for my family I've got to have time
[58:00] for this church I've got to have time to
[58:02] study and all these different things and
[58:03] something has to give sometimes and I've
[58:05] got to be able to say I don't have to do
[58:07] go everywhere and be all things to all
[58:08] people amen and neither do you neither
[58:11] do you amen sisters if you're married
[58:14] your husband is the one that gives you
[58:15] direction for dayto day and his
[58:17] expectations are the only ones that
[58:19] matter amen that's it you don't have to
[58:23] be driven by what everyone else do does
[58:25] and how good they are and how clean
[58:26] their house is and how how great a meal
[58:28] they cook every day your husband is the
[58:29] only one you're there to satisfy and
[58:31] nobody else
[58:32] matters and if they're injecting what
[58:35] they think get your husband to have a
[58:36] chat with them because that's what he's
[58:38] there to do as well amen settle things
[58:41] down back people off a little bit amen
[58:44] but if you never stop you'll never find
[58:45] rest is the point brother I'm saying
[58:48] Satan keeps us moving all the time so
[58:50] that we won't sit still and give God the
[58:52] time that he has amen if everything is
[58:54] all ahead of us and we're go go go we're
[58:56] never going to find rest we're getting
[58:58] some practicality here this evening
[59:00] brother Bram says this he says remember
[59:02] after all you're a nature and after all
[59:05] nature gets quiet and still then the de
[59:08] begins to fall and that refreshes and
[59:11] brings forth life he says and you are a
[59:13] nature yourself and when you get quiet
[59:16] and still before God then the dues of
[59:19] Heaven begins to fall and it begins to
[59:22] refresh he says did you ever go out of a
[59:24] morning after the night has passed early
[59:26] of a morning also at blossoms to give
[59:28] fragrance do you ever go early of a
[59:30] morning to that fragrance and you find
[59:32] out that early of a morning when you get
[59:34] out the Dew is hanging low the trees are
[59:36] budding the blossoms are coming off see
[59:39] we want it all
[59:41] Supernatural because if we do it all
[59:43] Supernatural it takes every bit of
[59:45] responsibility off of us and brother B's
[59:48] coming here and he's saying listen you
[59:49] got a part to play you've got to get
[59:52] quiet you've got to give the time you've
[59:54] got to take a deep breath you know when
[59:57] we go hunting we're up early in the
[1:00:00] morning and the perfect time of day is
[1:00:02] early in the morning because almost
[1:00:03] nobody's up everything's still
[1:00:06] everything's sleeping everything's quiet
[1:00:08] and it's such a peace that's there you
[1:00:11] notice David never said I get up early I
[1:00:13] I stay up late at night he says I get up
[1:00:15] early in the morning the morning's the
[1:00:17] time the morning's the time refreshing
[1:00:19] at night you're tired you're worn out
[1:00:21] you're not as focused but early in the
[1:00:22] morning that's when you can give God
[1:00:23] some real time
[1:00:26] he says go along the road and smell the
[1:00:28] honeysuckle into the Rose Garden of an
[1:00:30] early morning that's why it's been quiet
[1:00:32] Nature has through the night it got
[1:00:35] quiet and God bathed it with refreshing
[1:00:37] that's what you need to do is get away
[1:00:40] and get quiet before God so he can bathe
[1:00:43] you with the refreshment from Heaven
[1:00:45] amen he says Get Alone to yourself close
[1:00:47] the doors pull them together and say now
[1:00:50] Lord here I am in your presence we need
[1:00:53] refreshing every every day cuz there's a
[1:00:55] battle every single day every single day
[1:00:58] when brother Dwayne was here it was so
[1:00:59] instructive for me because usually when
[1:01:01] I do first thing in the morning as I
[1:01:02] pick up my phone I SN my watch to find
[1:01:04] out how much rest I got I'd be able to
[1:01:07] tell but I would syn up my my bit and
[1:01:10] I'd look at that then I read any texts
[1:01:12] or anything like that and I get squared
[1:01:14] away and then I go down and have
[1:01:15] devotions and he said the first moment
[1:01:17] of your day ought to be for God thank
[1:01:20] him for breath that You' got in the
[1:01:21] morning ask him for leadership and
[1:01:23] guidance for your day
[1:01:25] and lay your day before him amen not get
[1:01:29] up cram some food down your throat and
[1:01:31] rush out the door to work not not get
[1:01:33] into things with your kids if your kids
[1:01:36] get up you have to get up before them
[1:01:38] that's the way to do it get up and give
[1:01:40] him that time it may only be 5 10 15
[1:01:43] minutes before those little Peet feet
[1:01:45] come pattering to your door and you got
[1:01:47] to give it up but that first moment is
[1:01:49] so key because that's the chance for you
[1:01:51] to get settled for your day and let him
[1:01:53] just kind of refresh you you hopefully
[1:01:55] you've gotten some sleep hopefully you
[1:01:57] got a break hopefully you're relaxed and
[1:01:59] he can come in he can just do something
[1:02:00] for you amen we've got to just sometimes
[1:02:03] we just need to stop planning stop
[1:02:06] moving and just say Lord I'm putting
[1:02:08] things in your hands for the
[1:02:10] day I'm trusting you to work this out
[1:02:13] I'm trusting you to sort it out I'm
[1:02:14] trusting you to bring me what I need and
[1:02:17] just get in there and say you know turn
[1:02:18] off the phone turn off the phone lock
[1:02:22] the door if the kids are up say leave
[1:02:23] mommy or dadd alone my kids know if I'm
[1:02:27] downstairs in the morning they don't
[1:02:29] come in unless that door is open if they
[1:02:32] have to go in they knock first because
[1:02:34] Daddy's having devotions and you don't
[1:02:36] walk in when daddy's having
[1:02:38] devotions and we've got to have that
[1:02:40] we've got to say let me be for a bit and
[1:02:44] set that time aside and you know what if
[1:02:46] we can't get up early it means we need
[1:02:48] to go to bed a little earlier too we
[1:02:51] don't have to stay up till midnight my
[1:02:53] wife and I we've had to do
[1:02:55] this cuzz what happened is I'd study
[1:02:57] till late then I'd come to bed it'd be
[1:02:59] 10:30 and you're trying to unwind and so
[1:03:01] you're another 30 minutes or an hour
[1:03:03] before you actually go to sleep and then
[1:03:05] you're trying to get up early and it
[1:03:06] doesn't work so you know what she said
[1:03:08] she said John you got to be done by 9:30
[1:03:11] so we can be lights out by 10:30 so we
[1:03:14] can get a good night's sleep and we can
[1:03:15] get up at the time we're supposed to
[1:03:17] instead of having this up and down thing
[1:03:18] where we're tired one morning and we're
[1:03:20] okay the next and this and that the
[1:03:21] other thing it gives us stability it
[1:03:23] allows us to start our day right if you
[1:03:24] finish it right you can start it right
[1:03:27] Church we're real practical here this
[1:03:29] evening for a first little bit amen but
[1:03:32] look at this portion because Jesus was
[1:03:34] practical you know what I love I love
[1:03:37] Jesus he covers the whole
[1:03:38] Spectrum down down right right where we
[1:03:41] live to the absolute Supernatural in our
[1:03:43] lives and he expressed every single bit
[1:03:45] of it but look at this scripture amen
[1:03:47] this in Mark 31 and he said unto them
[1:03:49] he's speaking to the disciples Come Ye
[1:03:52] yourselves apart into a desert place and
[1:03:55] rest a while what's in the desert
[1:03:58] nothing that was the point nothing's in
[1:04:01] the desert let's go someplace where
[1:04:03] there's nobody there's nothing he says
[1:04:05] for there were many coming and going and
[1:04:07] they had no leisure so much as to eat
[1:04:10] they didn't even have time to eat and
[1:04:12] Jesus said listen we're servants we know
[1:04:14] your servants your disciples you're here
[1:04:16] for the people you're here to do a work
[1:04:18] but listen the spirit's willing but the
[1:04:20] flesh is weak and you've got to make an
[1:04:23] account for the flesh cuz if you destroy
[1:04:24] the flesh I don't care how good your
[1:04:26] spirit is you're not going to have
[1:04:27] strength to do it so he says you got to
[1:04:29] come aside and rest a while you've got
[1:04:32] to do it he forced him to do it he
[1:04:34] didn't say hey if you want to let's take
[1:04:36] a break he said take a break you've got
[1:04:38] to do it you haven't had a break you've
[1:04:40] been working yourselves too hard
[1:04:42] amen this is
[1:04:44] Christ this is God in flesh church this
[1:04:48] is as much the word as anything else
[1:04:50] we've read and he says take some time
[1:04:52] aside take a break settle down a bit
[1:04:55] amen you know I was listening to the
[1:04:58] brother's talk about when you guys kind
[1:04:59] of did the the uh the remodel of the old
[1:05:01] church building and some of you were
[1:05:03] working a full day and then you were
[1:05:05] driving in and you were working into the
[1:05:07] evening and you come home late at night
[1:05:10] and that's okay for a season cuz there's
[1:05:12] a season for those things but all day
[1:05:15] every day that's not God's will it's
[1:05:17] never been God's Will and we see it here
[1:05:19] you can do it for a while but you've got
[1:05:21] to come aside and take a break listen
[1:05:23] the prophet of God experienced it early
[1:05:25] in his ministry remember he had the gift
[1:05:27] of discernment in his hand remember and
[1:05:30] the people would come up and they touch
[1:05:31] him and he get all the dots over his
[1:05:32] hand he'd tell them what was wrong but
[1:05:34] every time he did it he got weaker and
[1:05:36] weaker and weaker but he had a heart for
[1:05:38] the people he had a he had a servant's
[1:05:40] heart he wanted to do it there were
[1:05:42] times where he would stay on the
[1:05:44] platform for a week a week straight and
[1:05:47] he would eat his meals on the platform
[1:05:49] he'd lay down on the side for a bit and
[1:05:51] then he'd get up and he' continue
[1:05:52] praying and you know what happened he
[1:05:54] got sick he got bad sick he got so sick
[1:05:57] he couldn't Minister for months why
[1:05:59] because he wore himself out and then so
[1:06:01] somebody with some common sense said
[1:06:04] brother brandom you can't kill yourself
[1:06:06] doing this otherwise you're of no good
[1:06:07] to the people and so what happened was
[1:06:09] they had his managers there and when
[1:06:11] they saw him getting weak they would
[1:06:12] take him they'd tap him they'd say
[1:06:14] time's up and they'd remove him from the
[1:06:16] platform for his
[1:06:18] sake for his sake pull him aside amen
[1:06:22] exhaustion is not God's will
[1:06:24] God doesn't run us into the ground day
[1:06:26] in and day out that's not it that's not
[1:06:29] the way he does it amen we live a life
[1:06:31] of service yes we're we're we're serving
[1:06:33] our families we're serving our neighbors
[1:06:35] our communities all these different
[1:06:36] things but God doesn't seek to run us
[1:06:38] into the
[1:06:39] ground we have hard times but it's not
[1:06:42] exhaustion because of all the goings and
[1:06:44] comings that's not his
[1:06:47] will so as a Believers we need to stop
[1:06:49] and consider are we tired because of
[1:06:51] needs or because of wants is it because
[1:06:54] of
[1:06:55] contentment or is it ambition that's
[1:06:57] driving
[1:06:58] us we can we can set our sights on
[1:07:01] something and we can drive ourselves we
[1:07:03] can we can run ourselves into Oblivion
[1:07:05] total exhaustion trying to get something
[1:07:07] and the question is does God want it for
[1:07:08] us does God really want it for us or is
[1:07:11] it us that wants it for us amen and then
[1:07:13] we have the expectations versus the
[1:07:15] reality what really matters or what are
[1:07:17] people putting on us or what are we
[1:07:18] putting on ourselves you get high
[1:07:20] performance driven individuals we'll put
[1:07:22] things on ourselves that nobody else
[1:07:25] will and it's not God it's not God it's
[1:07:28] not the way he operates amen you know I
[1:07:30] was talking with the deacons and
[1:07:31] trustees over the last week and and over
[1:07:33] the last few months and then certain
[1:07:35] things come up and I tell the brothers
[1:07:37] that sounds like a deacon problem that
[1:07:40] sounds like a trustee problem why
[1:07:41] because they've got an area that they're
[1:07:43] supposed to handle in the church and
[1:07:45] what do they do they're letting me know
[1:07:46] and I say keep me in the loop but it's
[1:07:48] all yours that's literally why we have
[1:07:51] deacons is to take the burden off of the
[1:07:53] ministry
[1:07:55] and the trustees are there to take the
[1:07:56] burden off of the ministry I told
[1:07:58] brother Mark I said why would I want to
[1:07:59] do what you're doing it's just more work
[1:08:01] more stress and it doesn't matter a
[1:08:04] single Lick in my
[1:08:06] Ministry it doesn't matter money doesn't
[1:08:09] matter me being a minister adds no value
[1:08:12] to handling the money which is why we
[1:08:13] let a treasurer do it why we let the
[1:08:15] trustees manage these things in general
[1:08:17] I'm aware of what goes on I have say
[1:08:19] over the ties but I hand that over to
[1:08:21] them and they manage it for me and I get
[1:08:22] a I get a report every month and I love
[1:08:24] that I love that because he knows
[1:08:26] exactly what I need and I get it every
[1:08:28] month and I don't have to worry about it
[1:08:29] and I don't worry about it I don't sit
[1:08:31] there struggling are we going to make it
[1:08:33] are we going to do it no they take care
[1:08:36] of every little bit of it and all I'm
[1:08:37] doing is keeping tabs on it one day for
[1:08:40] about 5 or 10 minutes a month that's all
[1:08:42] I have to give to finances because we've
[1:08:43] got people to take the burden now
[1:08:46] sometimes we look around and people are
[1:08:48] in a a stage of life and they're in a
[1:08:49] phase and they need help and so we'll
[1:08:52] put ourselves out for their sake because
[1:08:53] we see that they need help but that's
[1:08:55] only for a season and then God will
[1:08:57] bring them up to speed and they'll be
[1:08:58] able to step in and do their own thing
[1:09:00] amen amen but it's not that we can't do
[1:09:02] things it's that we don't always have to
[1:09:04] do things and we've got to be able to
[1:09:05] discern that we've got to have
[1:09:06] leadership for that you know when I was
[1:09:08] studying this I was thinking and I was
[1:09:10] reminded of Elijah you know he had that
[1:09:12] great Mount Carmel Victory where he goes
[1:09:14] up and he challenges the the people and
[1:09:16] he says you know if God is God then let
[1:09:19] him prove himself and the real God
[1:09:20] proved and he he he burned the sacrifice
[1:09:23] and he burned the Altar and he destroyed
[1:09:24] it all and then Elijah went and he he he
[1:09:27] killed the the prophets of Baal then he
[1:09:29] had this great Victory and then right
[1:09:31] afterwards what happens I is Jezebel
[1:09:34] says I'm going to make you just like the
[1:09:36] prophets dead and he takes off running
[1:09:40] and he goes off into the Wilderness for
[1:09:41] a day and he just
[1:09:43] crumbles after such a great Victory
[1:09:46] after seeing God vindicate Reigns back
[1:09:48] in the land everything should be right
[1:09:50] and all of a sudden he's running from
[1:09:51] the from the threat of his life from a
[1:09:53] woman and and he just crumbles the
[1:09:55] prophet of God he crumbles and look at
[1:09:57] what the scripture says about him it
[1:09:59] says and he himself went a Day's Journey
[1:10:01] Into the Wilderness and came and sat
[1:10:03] down under a juniper and he requested
[1:10:06] for himself that he might
[1:10:08] die and said it is
[1:10:11] enough in other words I've had enough he
[1:10:15] says now oh Lord take away my life for I
[1:10:18] am not better than my fathers Elijah's
[1:10:20] done he's had enough he's done
[1:10:22] everything God asked him to do now he's
[1:10:24] running once again for his life he's
[1:10:25] sick and tired of hiding and running
[1:10:27] nobody likes him everybody hates him
[1:10:29] might as well eat worms he's had it he's
[1:10:32] done amen he's tired of not being
[1:10:34] appreciated and he just wants to end it
[1:10:36] all he just wants to end it all have you
[1:10:39] ever hit the end of the
[1:10:41] road seems like no matter what you do it
[1:10:45] doesn't make a difference you work and
[1:10:47] you work and you work and the bank
[1:10:49] account balance doesn't change except it
[1:10:50] goes down right you put your heart you
[1:10:53] put your soul into something and you're
[1:10:55] no further ahead and it seems like
[1:10:57] you're not making Headway you do things
[1:10:59] for people day in and day out and day in
[1:11:01] and day out and all you get is what no
[1:11:04] thanks and no
[1:11:05] appreciation in fact you get criticism
[1:11:07] for the work you
[1:11:09] do yeah we all face that at some time
[1:11:13] don't we you empty out every day nobody
[1:11:16] seems to fill you up remember Elijah
[1:11:18] said is it just me he got to the point
[1:11:21] where he thought I'm the only one that's
[1:11:22] even serving God anymore
[1:11:24] and we can get that way as Believers
[1:11:26] amen as Believers we're servants you
[1:11:27] know brother baham said eternal life is
[1:11:29] living for others but sometimes we act
[1:11:32] like eternal life is earned by living
[1:11:34] for others rather than it's the
[1:11:36] expression of eternal life and we give
[1:11:38] and we give and we give and we give and
[1:11:40] we burn ourselves out and it's not God
[1:11:42] that's telling us to do that amen you
[1:11:45] know the scripture tells us to Bear one
[1:11:47] another's burdens and then says for
[1:11:48] every man to bear his own burden and you
[1:11:51] say how does that work if you look look
[1:11:53] at the one that says every man bear his
[1:11:55] own burden that's the dayto day in other
[1:11:57] words I'm not supposed to Bear brother
[1:11:59] Bob's burdens dayto day the the the
[1:12:01] day-to-day things that he deals with and
[1:12:03] finances and these these these these
[1:12:05] these things that we all deal with but
[1:12:07] then it says bear one another's burdens
[1:12:08] that's the big stuff that's when hard
[1:12:10] times hit that's when people really need
[1:12:12] that hand that help that shoulder to the
[1:12:14] wheel to help them get through that's
[1:12:15] what they're for but dayto day we're to
[1:12:17] carry our own burdens to the Lord amen
[1:12:20] that's because we're supposed to be
[1:12:22] yolked to him not to each other
[1:12:24] so the dayto day is with that with him
[1:12:26] and then the the extras that's where he
[1:12:28] gives us Believers to help carry that
[1:12:29] load and provide that support for us
[1:12:31] when we really really read it really
[1:12:33] really need it but Elijah here and he's
[1:12:35] worn out he's depressed to the point
[1:12:37] where he just wants to die now I won't
[1:12:39] ask for a show of hands but I've dealt
[1:12:40] with depression and you know what the
[1:12:42] thing is about depression is you get to
[1:12:44] the point where you've you don't even
[1:12:46] understand why you are where you
[1:12:48] are you just are and somebody telling
[1:12:51] you you just need to snap out of it it
[1:12:53] doesn't do do you any good cuz you don't
[1:12:55] even understand why you're there and
[1:12:57] sometimes you don't even understand you
[1:12:58] are
[1:12:59] there until you finally come out of it
[1:13:02] and then you realize I was
[1:13:04] depressed because you've gotten so used
[1:13:06] to being so down in the dumps and that
[1:13:09] depression just so overwhelms you that
[1:13:11] you don't nothing nothing nothing
[1:13:13] matters anymore life isn't doesn't
[1:13:15] doesn't feel like anything food becomes
[1:13:17] tasteless nothing brings you Joy and
[1:13:19] you're just a
[1:13:21] lump I've been there I got the T-shirt
[1:13:23] to prove it it's a hard place to be and
[1:13:26] so often what happens is we drive
[1:13:28] ourselves into
[1:13:30] it we overwork ourselves we overextend
[1:13:33] ourselves and it doesn't go the way we
[1:13:35] think it goes and then all of a sudden
[1:13:37] we just like Elijah we just crater we
[1:13:42] crumble that's not where God wants us to
[1:13:45] be amen and he's there to take us out of
[1:13:48] it God won't leave us there anden
[1:13:50] there's an answer for that and I'm a
[1:13:51] testimony for that but brother brand he
[1:13:53] he he he takes us into this scripture
[1:13:55] here and the whole thing that happens
[1:13:57] and I didn't put it there for the sake
[1:13:58] of time but he says he says he sent an
[1:14:01] angel Elijah says I just want to
[1:14:04] die it says and he sent an Angel and the
[1:14:06] angel touched him and he went to sleep
[1:14:08] so catch both sides of this now the
[1:14:10] angel puts him to sleep first and gives
[1:14:12] him rest and when he woke up there were
[1:14:14] some kind of cakes baked laying on the
[1:14:15] side of him and he said Elijah rise up
[1:14:18] and eat he says there's the grace of God
[1:14:20] to his servant see he's resting him it's
[1:14:23] not just the food but it's the rest we
[1:14:26] can give you all the food you can take
[1:14:28] up here but sometimes you got to rest
[1:14:29] and let it let it go to work in your
[1:14:31] life a bit and me just settle down and
[1:14:34] so God knows what's coming for Elijah he
[1:14:36] knows how worn out he is and he also
[1:14:38] knows what's ahead of him so he lays him
[1:14:40] down there and he rests him and then he
[1:14:42] wakes him up and then he feeds him and
[1:14:45] then he rests him and then he wakes him
[1:14:47] up and feeds them and then he rests them
[1:14:48] and then he feeds them again three times
[1:14:50] he does it because he knows he's about
[1:14:52] to take a journey and he says it's
[1:14:54] the grace of God to his servant to give
[1:14:57] him this break and in this experience
[1:15:00] with this this food and this rest that
[1:15:02] God gave Elijah he went 40 days journey
[1:15:05] without anything
[1:15:06] else when God comes in and gives rest
[1:15:10] amen but he got his servant to settle
[1:15:12] down take a break rest relax a little
[1:15:15] bit he says you know Jesus said come
[1:15:18] aside Into the Wilderness and rest a
[1:15:19] little while and some of these guys that
[1:15:22] think you don't have to rest
[1:15:23] we find out that they burn out pretty
[1:15:25] quick too if they don't take rest they
[1:15:28] find themselves wrecked up somewhere now
[1:15:31] watch who he's talking to we can apply
[1:15:34] it in the natural we can apply it in
[1:15:35] ministries wherever we want he says I
[1:15:37] think that's where our brother Billy
[1:15:38] Graham is tonight trying to overshoot
[1:15:40] the mark he says these human bodies are
[1:15:43] strong but they need rest he says then
[1:15:46] you can take a little rest and you go
[1:15:49] somewhere and they'll criticize you and
[1:15:50] say I thought he was a preacher look at
[1:15:52] him out yonder on the bank fishing or
[1:15:54] something like that he says but that
[1:15:55] doesn't matter Jehovah will take care of
[1:15:57] his own brother Adam wanted to go out
[1:16:00] into the Wilderness he says there's no
[1:16:01] Spirits out there and he could rest and
[1:16:04] relax and that's why he go hunting and
[1:16:05] he go fishing and these things was that
[1:16:07] his Spirit could rest not just his body
[1:16:09] but his Spirit his mind could just
[1:16:12] settle down and just not do anything for
[1:16:14] a while and just be out in nature where
[1:16:16] there was cleanliness and and just
[1:16:18] things that were good for him amen you
[1:16:20] know when I was in BC and I had a great
[1:16:22] job best pain job I ever had and I had
[1:16:25] that horrible coworker and the stress
[1:16:27] was driving me nuts my blood pressure
[1:16:29] was going up up up up up and I was
[1:16:32] starting to get Snappy at home and these
[1:16:33] different things and finally I decided I
[1:16:35] was going to quit cuz it wasn't worth it
[1:16:38] and so I told my wife I'm going to quit
[1:16:40] and she's like thank
[1:16:42] God best paying job we ever had thank
[1:16:45] God you're quitting I said I'd like to
[1:16:46] take a month off she said I think that's
[1:16:48] a good idea in fact take
[1:16:51] two and so I did well I I tried to and
[1:16:54] then I got recruited and I ended up I
[1:16:55] got one and a half days of hunting I I
[1:16:58] went over and I took took brother Jonah
[1:16:59] M's Services cuz he wanted to go
[1:17:02] hunting but the point is is that she had
[1:17:06] my back she realized I needed to
[1:17:09] just lay it down and just recover for a
[1:17:13] little bit and it's okay to do that
[1:17:15] brother Bram says he says you'll look at
[1:17:16] a preacher and he he goes off and and he
[1:17:18] goes off and he takes a break and you
[1:17:19] say I thought you were a preacher yes
[1:17:21] but these bodies need rest amen these
[1:17:23] bodies need a break and I don't care
[1:17:25] what role you're in whether it's
[1:17:26] Ministry whether it's a husband a wife
[1:17:28] spouse whatever it is we've got to take
[1:17:30] our breaks and it's okay to take a break
[1:17:33] it's okay to not clean the house one day
[1:17:35] it's okay to just bring in Little
[1:17:37] Caesars for supper from time to time
[1:17:40] it's okay to just mail it in and say
[1:17:42] it's okay cuz it ain't the end of the
[1:17:45] world this is the end of the world but
[1:17:48] us not making our beds or cleaning our
[1:17:49] house or eating a healthy meal for once
[1:17:51] is not the end of the world
[1:17:53] we put so much pressure sometimes we get
[1:17:55] gunshi do you know what gunshi is gunshi
[1:17:59] is for hunting dogs what happens is some
[1:18:01] of them are they're just that way some
[1:18:03] of them have a bad experience but what
[1:18:05] happens is they're scared of guns
[1:18:06] they're scared of the sight of guns and
[1:18:07] they're scared of the sound of guns now
[1:18:09] I don't know if you you realize this but
[1:18:11] hunting dogs are no good if they don't
[1:18:12] like guns because guns are going off all
[1:18:14] over and they're using them to find and
[1:18:16] retrieve animals that are hunting amen
[1:18:18] so at some point that dog might have had
[1:18:20] a bad experience or they' just got
[1:18:21] something built into them they can't
[1:18:23] bring themselves to do what they're
[1:18:25] supposed to do and sometimes as
[1:18:27] Believers we get that way we get hurt we
[1:18:29] get offended we get burned by a Believer
[1:18:31] and now we can't fellowship or get close
[1:18:33] to Believers because we think the same
[1:18:35] thing might happen again and we've had
[1:18:37] we we you have people that will that are
[1:18:40] handled roughly and sometimes we're not
[1:18:42] handled roughly we think we're handled
[1:18:43] roughly and honestly it doesn't make a
[1:18:44] difference our feelings dominate in
[1:18:46] those things and so they're worried that
[1:18:48] if they do that again then this thing's
[1:18:50] going to happen or that amen and next
[1:18:52] thing you know we're cutting ourselves
[1:18:53] off from people and we're cutting
[1:18:55] ourselves off from fellowship and church
[1:18:56] and Believers and relationships and we
[1:18:58] can get into a place where we're bound
[1:19:00] up and we can't rest even at
[1:19:03] church amen what is it we forget we're a
[1:19:06] child of God and we start thinking we're
[1:19:09] something
[1:19:10] else amen we belong to him he's our
[1:19:13] father he's our protector he's our guide
[1:19:16] amen he's our refuge brother Brown would
[1:19:18] talk about people that get just so so
[1:19:20] bound up and this is in the message
[1:19:22] letting off the pressure he says and we
[1:19:24] get to a place where everything's just
[1:19:25] all crusted up he says oh little eaglet
[1:19:29] maybe some little girl some little boy
[1:19:31] maybe some old person or middle-age why
[1:19:33] are you here this morning because he
[1:19:36] says you're really an eagle they'll come
[1:19:38] and they'll sit in the church but
[1:19:39] they're not getting what they need but
[1:19:40] he says you're here why because you're
[1:19:42] an eagle you know you should be here you
[1:19:45] know there's something here for you but
[1:19:47] you're not getting it he says but maybe
[1:19:49] the cares of life has kind of battled
[1:19:51] you around roughly you've lost sight
[1:19:53] you're not sure no more where you're
[1:19:55] placing your foot he says let's just
[1:19:57] come up against The Rock now and says oh
[1:19:59] lead me to the Rock that's higher than I
[1:20:01] let me lay on this rock cuz he's a
[1:20:03] shelter in the time of storm remember
[1:20:05] brother B and this is what he's talking
[1:20:07] about here of the Eagles and they go
[1:20:08] through that refreshing stage where they
[1:20:11] come to a certain age he says and then
[1:20:13] their beaks get all crusted over and
[1:20:15] their claws get all kinds of sores in
[1:20:17] them and they lose their feathers they
[1:20:19] can't fly they can't hunt they can't eat
[1:20:21] they can't do all these things and they
[1:20:23] just stay in a place and somebody else
[1:20:25] has to come and feed them for a while
[1:20:28] cuz they're not in a condition to do it
[1:20:29] they're going through a refreshing
[1:20:31] they're going through a Reviving but
[1:20:33] they've got to go through a death of
[1:20:34] sorts before they can get new
[1:20:37] life he says start beating against this
[1:20:40] door right now beating against the door
[1:20:42] of this rock it says he'll open up the
[1:20:44] crust will fly off we get these sores we
[1:20:46] get these hurts these offenses all over
[1:20:48] us and it pulls us away from arrest
[1:20:50] we're supposed to have he he says then
[1:20:53] the pressure will leave you and you can
[1:20:54] be at rest again the pressure all gone
[1:20:56] you can come to church no matter what
[1:20:58] the pastor preaches
[1:21:01] about people leave church because of
[1:21:03] what pastors say even if it's the truth
[1:21:06] even if it's the word and even if it's
[1:21:08] said the right way why because they've
[1:21:11] got crusts they've got offenses they've
[1:21:13] got areas of their life that are
[1:21:15] sensitive and it causes them to pull
[1:21:17] away he says as long as he stays in that
[1:21:20] word of God it'll never condemn you
[1:21:22] you've done Rec in there and you're all
[1:21:24] right now we've had people in this
[1:21:26] church maybe some of you know them that
[1:21:29] got beat up by Ministries and just for
[1:21:31] them to sit in this building and listen
[1:21:33] to this ministry is nothing less than a
[1:21:37] miracle they've been beat up they've
[1:21:40] been indoctrinated they finally came out
[1:21:42] of it and they've almost said I'll never
[1:21:43] go back to one again and they don't
[1:21:45] trust Ministry and they don't trust
[1:21:46] church people and they don't trust
[1:21:48] organization of any sort and they just
[1:21:49] want to stay home and do their own thing
[1:21:51] but then they'll come through the these
[1:21:53] doors and God will touch them but we've
[1:21:56] got to treat those people very very
[1:21:58] gently you can say well they've been in
[1:22:00] the message for 20 30 40 10 years
[1:22:03] whatever it is they ought to know these
[1:22:05] things no they're in a stage of coming
[1:22:07] through a change and they've got these
[1:22:09] crusts and they've got these hurts and
[1:22:11] these offenses and we've got to be
[1:22:12] gentle with them we can't force them you
[1:22:16] can't force someone to grow in Christ
[1:22:18] you can't force someone to take the
[1:22:19] fullness of the word you can't force
[1:22:21] Trust that's the greatest way to cause
[1:22:23] distrust is to try and force trusten we
[1:22:26] can't do those things we got to give
[1:22:27] them room to heal we got to love them be
[1:22:30] gracious be patient listen we've got new
[1:22:32] converts that come in we can't force
[1:22:35] them to grow God has to do it in his
[1:22:38] time his season his way amen we can't
[1:22:43] force we can't say well when I came into
[1:22:45] the the message or when I gave my heart
[1:22:47] to the Lord I did this and this and this
[1:22:49] well that's great for you praise the
[1:22:50] Lord but that may not be the way that
[1:22:52] they go
[1:22:53] and we've got to be gracious with these
[1:22:54] sorts of people amen we've got to let
[1:22:56] God work on them and not force our our
[1:22:58] path or our standard or our timelines on
[1:23:00] them I think it was brother Barry coffee
[1:23:02] talked about this woman and she had a
[1:23:03] real bad experience she really got
[1:23:05] worked over by a Ministry and she was
[1:23:07] out of church and she was worried about
[1:23:09] coming back to
[1:23:11] church cuz she didn't want to get hurt
[1:23:14] again and he said sister just come to
[1:23:17] church sit at the very back don't do
[1:23:21] anything just listen to the word and let
[1:23:25] the word work let the word
[1:23:29] wash he says don't try anything don't
[1:23:32] try to do anything don't try and be
[1:23:34] anything he says just sit there and
[1:23:37] listen to the word and let the word do
[1:23:38] the work that's the same thing we have
[1:23:40] to do every day for every one of us let
[1:23:43] the word do the work because if I can
[1:23:45] force you into it somebody else can
[1:23:46] force you out of it amen I'm not giving
[1:23:49] you rest you've got to find your rest in
[1:23:51] the word and when you take it and you
[1:23:53] believe it yourself sovereignly then
[1:23:55] that's the work that God will keep in
[1:23:56] your life if I force it or some other
[1:23:58] brother or sister does it it won't stick
[1:24:00] amen we don't have to push people now
[1:24:03] I'm sorry I've spent 50 minutes being
[1:24:05] practical this evening but I felt to
[1:24:07] just Dro that
[1:24:09] in amen there's a portion that's up to
[1:24:12] us to to get still to give time and
[1:24:16] question why we're so
[1:24:18] busy because he says otherwise we're
[1:24:20] going to end up broken up somewhere
[1:24:24] right and then like I said at the start
[1:24:27] we can't be so spiritual that we're of
[1:24:28] no earthly good and we can get to the
[1:24:31] place where we put ourselves and it's
[1:24:33] Pride honestly that does it sometimes
[1:24:35] Duty mostly Pride I think that we put
[1:24:37] ourselves to such a high standard of
[1:24:38] living and acting and being and doing
[1:24:40] that we forget that we're supposed to be
[1:24:42] led by the spirit not led by just what
[1:24:45] we see needs to be done there's a body
[1:24:47] for a reason it's to share the load it's
[1:24:49] to spread the load man I I I'm blessed
[1:24:52] with this church I believe because it's
[1:24:53] not just one or two people here doing
[1:24:55] the work we've got a full body ministry
[1:24:57] here where everybody's doing something
[1:24:59] and I praise the Lord for that because
[1:25:00] it means that no one person has to carry
[1:25:02] the load all the time but I want to take
[1:25:04] us back for the last few minutes of this
[1:25:06] service here and I won't be long on this
[1:25:08] thought of you shall find rest and what
[1:25:10] we read here in Joshua 21 and he says
[1:25:12] and the lord gave unto Israel all the
[1:25:15] land which he swear to give so what he
[1:25:18] gave by his word he gave him reality
[1:25:21] every single of it he says unto their
[1:25:23] fathers and they possessed it and dwelt
[1:25:25] therein and the lord gave them rest
[1:25:27] round about according to what all that
[1:25:30] he swore to their fathers and there
[1:25:33] stood not a man of all their enemies
[1:25:34] before them the Lord delivered all their
[1:25:37] enemies into their hand there failed not
[1:25:40] ought of any good thing which the Lord
[1:25:43] had spoken unto the house of Israel all
[1:25:47] came to
[1:25:48] pass now that's a backward looking
[1:25:51] statement it's a back backward looking
[1:25:52] scripture from when they're at the end
[1:25:56] they've taken Canaan there's rest in the
[1:25:58] land there's peace in the
[1:26:00] land but the promise was given
[1:26:05] 440 years 430 plus 40 no the 480 years
[1:26:11] before that 480 years God gave the
[1:26:15] promise and now they have a scripture
[1:26:17] and it's God saying I did everything I
[1:26:19] told you I was going to do nothing I
[1:26:21] told you hasn't come to pass every
[1:26:23] single bit that I've told you has come
[1:26:25] to pass this is where ourr is supposed
[1:26:27] to be church that he does what he says
[1:26:33] amen God told it to Abraham Abraham told
[1:26:36] it to Isaac God confirmed it to Isaac
[1:26:37] God confirmed him to Jacob and then now
[1:26:40] they're sitting here and they've got
[1:26:41] family after family they're Generations
[1:26:43] deep into this now and it's far far far
[1:26:47] away 10 12 13 Generations later and they
[1:26:50] finally get to experience the full of it
[1:26:53] you I've been reading the church age
[1:26:55] book with brother Kingsley and it's
[1:26:57] amazing how we look into that and at the
[1:26:59] beginning of Revelation it says that
[1:27:00] this is going to be a short work you
[1:27:02] know what a short work is 2,000
[1:27:06] years see we got to look at things
[1:27:08] through God's eyes not just ours because
[1:27:11] he's got a time and he's got a season
[1:27:13] for these things amen but God says
[1:27:15] everything I told you I came to pass not
[1:27:18] only did they possess
[1:27:20] it but they lived it
[1:27:22] it they dwell in it see you can imagine
[1:27:26] here in New Finland if I had title to a
[1:27:29] home and it's on the ocean front and
[1:27:31] it's got a big beautiful beach in front
[1:27:32] of it and it's got a a pier with it and
[1:27:34] it's got a nice power booat out there
[1:27:36] and some kayaks and all these different
[1:27:38] things if I've got the title D to it
[1:27:40] that's possession I own it but what's
[1:27:43] the good of possessing it if I don't
[1:27:44] live there if I don't ever go and
[1:27:46] experience it and that's what God's
[1:27:48] saying is I didn't just bring you into
[1:27:49] it I've allowed you to live in it not
[1:27:51] only do you know you have it you're in
[1:27:53] it you're enjoying the benefits of it
[1:27:55] you've got a daily manifestation you've
[1:27:57] got a daily enjoyment you've got a daily
[1:27:59] Vindication that God's with you because
[1:28:00] you're living in the promises of what he
[1:28:02] told you amen it was a reality to them
[1:28:05] you know we preached many times on on
[1:28:07] what Canaan is for the believer today
[1:28:09] and we know it's the promise of the Holy
[1:28:11] Ghost it's the promise of the Life of
[1:28:13] Christ dwelling in The Believer and it's
[1:28:15] is to you and it's to iess as to as many
[1:28:17] as the Lord Our God shall call amen it
[1:28:19] wasn't just for the apostles cuz there
[1:28:20] was 120 of them up in in the upper room
[1:28:22] and there was only 11 Apostles at that
[1:28:24] time so it's not just for Apostles it's
[1:28:26] not just for Ministry it's not just for
[1:28:28] the Jews because then he came and he
[1:28:29] gave it to the Samaritans then he gave
[1:28:31] it to Cornelius and the rest of the
[1:28:32] Gentiles so it's not based on race it's
[1:28:35] not based on Ministry it's not based on
[1:28:36] gender and it's not based on only the
[1:28:38] ones that are there because it says it's
[1:28:39] unto you and to your children and as
[1:28:41] many a far off as the Lord Our God shall
[1:28:43] call so there's no limit on This Promise
[1:28:46] they had it at the beginning and it's
[1:28:48] keeping on going until God fulfills
[1:28:50] every word of it amen but I want you to
[1:28:53] catch the subtlety and I was talking
[1:28:54] with brother Bob I think about this a
[1:28:56] little while back of what Satan tries to
[1:28:58] do because Satan's trying to limit our
[1:29:00] possession he's okay if you say I
[1:29:03] believe it he's not okay if you say I've
[1:29:06] got
[1:29:07] it right Satan will allow Satan's okay
[1:29:10] with you saying amen he's not okay with
[1:29:13] you taking possession putting your name
[1:29:15] going in and putting your two feet on
[1:29:17] the land that you own amen now listen to
[1:29:19] this brother Bram says he says now if
[1:29:21] this person denies that Jesus Christ is
[1:29:23] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:29:26] says now watch it you'll hear them say
[1:29:28] oh he's the same he says is he the same
[1:29:32] is he the
[1:29:33] same well they say he's the same in a
[1:29:37] certain
[1:29:39] way that's not what the scripture says
[1:29:42] scripture doesn't say Jesus Christ the
[1:29:43] same in a certain way yesterday today
[1:29:45] and forever says he's the same yesterday
[1:29:47] today and forever he says what way see
[1:29:50] what way well I believe that he's still
[1:29:52] saves well what about healing oh no he
[1:29:54] doesn't do that now when he was here on
[1:29:56] Earth they said he can heal but he can't
[1:29:58] save now they say he can say but he
[1:30:00] can't heal see it's just the devil
[1:30:03] taking vice versa sides many of your
[1:30:05] mainstream preachers today out in the
[1:30:07] world even the ones that are not
[1:30:09] affiliated with the denomination are
[1:30:11] preaching that signs and wonders and
[1:30:13] Supernatural are for the apostles only
[1:30:16] it's in the past that there is no Divine
[1:30:19] Healing there is no signs and wonders
[1:30:22] there is no Supernatural in the Church
[1:30:24] of the Living God today it's all just
[1:30:26] letter it's Faith unto salvation and
[1:30:29] that's it and they're preaching it and
[1:30:31] they're preaching it and it's mainstream
[1:30:33] all across it amen they don't believe
[1:30:35] God's working in his church anymore the
[1:30:37] way that he used
[1:30:38] to how can that be true the say
[1:30:41] scripture says that God is immutable
[1:30:43] that means he doesn't change so how can
[1:30:45] he be that way then and not that way now
[1:30:48] God hasn't changed God can't change we
[1:30:52] must have changed his word can't change
[1:30:54] so we must have changed our
[1:30:55] interpretation of it he says but if he's
[1:30:59] Jesus Christ at all the anointed one
[1:31:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:31:04] forever the same healer the same it's
[1:31:07] not you that does Miracles no they want
[1:31:09] to say let me see you do this I had to
[1:31:12] get over that as a minister people want
[1:31:15] you to do things I can't do anything
[1:31:18] brother bradam said I can't heal you if
[1:31:21] brother bradam the prophet of the age
[1:31:22] the star in the right hand of God can't
[1:31:24] do it what hope does little Jonathan
[1:31:25] Carlette have none I can't do it like I
[1:31:30] said last time brother Daryl Ward said
[1:31:31] our job is to pray the prayer of faith
[1:31:33] it's God's job to do the healing and
[1:31:36] then he says now God never said for me
[1:31:38] to do it he's already done it he said if
[1:31:41] Jesus Christ was here today he couldn't
[1:31:43] heal you any more than I could because
[1:31:45] he's already done
[1:31:47] it he says the only thing for me to do
[1:31:50] it says right there he's already done it
[1:31:52] the only thing for me to do is take his
[1:31:54] word and hold on to it and he will bring
[1:31:57] it to pass that's right that's exactly
[1:32:00] it isn't you it's the god that's in you
[1:32:04] that's the rest that's why brother B
[1:32:06] would say I read this quote many
[1:32:08] services ago maybe I didn't I know I
[1:32:10] studied it and they said brother brandom
[1:32:12] don't you get scared up there on the on
[1:32:14] the platform when you're dealing with
[1:32:16] situations and you're dealing with
[1:32:17] sicknesses and people coming up and they
[1:32:19] have no eyes in their sockets and they
[1:32:21] want eyesight
[1:32:22] and people have a foot that's shorter
[1:32:23] than another one and they want it to be
[1:32:25] lengthened out or cancer or demons or
[1:32:27] whatever it might be and he says no if
[1:32:30] God sent me then he'll take care of the
[1:32:32] situation we've got to know that if God
[1:32:35] has ordained us to be where we are doing
[1:32:37] what we are with who we're with then
[1:32:39] he'll take care of the
[1:32:41] situation and our job is to pray the
[1:32:43] prayer of faith and to act on what we
[1:32:45] believe that's it I want to walk in the
[1:32:48] middle of the road and I spent half this
[1:32:50] more than half this service on the
[1:32:52] Practical side but we believe in a
[1:32:54] supernatural God right here right now
[1:32:58] amen we believe in the Supernatural just
[1:33:01] in the healings we've seen in this
[1:33:02] church in the last couple of months we
[1:33:04] ought to be able to say I know God is
[1:33:05] real that he heals that he's
[1:33:07] Supernatural that he's Sovereign that
[1:33:10] he's all powerful and that he provides
[1:33:13] in his time and in his season
[1:33:15] amen there's nothing held back for those
[1:33:18] that are in Christ we're at the End of
[1:33:20] the Age all things are possible to them
[1:33:23] that are beli the book is completely
[1:33:25] open there's nothing held back from the
[1:33:27] believer at this time amen he's returned
[1:33:29] back in the form of the Holy Spirit to
[1:33:31] do the same works the scripture says why
[1:33:34] do I believe he's the same yesterday
[1:33:35] today and forever I believe it first of
[1:33:38] all because it's here but I rest in it
[1:33:41] because he's done it because he's done
[1:33:42] it in my life and he's done it in your
[1:33:44] life I've seen healings I've seen the
[1:33:46] supernatural I've seen tongues I've
[1:33:48] spoken in tongues I've seen and he heard
[1:33:50] tongues and interpretation
[1:33:52] I've seen prophecies given I've seen
[1:33:54] spiritual dreams I've had others tell me
[1:33:55] spiritual dreams that came true I've
[1:33:57] seen healings I've seen Deliverance I've
[1:33:59] seen demons cast out done in myself
[1:34:01] everything in the book of Acts short of
[1:34:04] the healing or the raising of the Dead
[1:34:06] I've seen in my life and in the lives of
[1:34:08] others and even within this very church
[1:34:10] that's why I rest in the idea that
[1:34:13] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:34:14] forever cuz I've experienced it I
[1:34:17] believed it now I have experienced it
[1:34:20] and what that means is that as we move
[1:34:22] closer and closer to what's coming for
[1:34:24] us a resurrection and Rapture he's
[1:34:27] building up our faith he's helping us to
[1:34:29] rest he's helping us to trust and every
[1:34:32] step we take is to help get us to the
[1:34:34] next step to the next step until we take
[1:34:35] the final step it starts with healing
[1:34:39] that's the earnest of the Resurrection
[1:34:42] that's the earnest of your body changes
[1:34:43] healing but then we come into life
[1:34:46] situations we come into characters we
[1:34:48] come into family situations we come into
[1:34:51] things that are are so twisted and tied
[1:34:52] up in men and and our fingers getting in
[1:34:54] the pie and all of these different
[1:34:56] things and we've got to be able to walk
[1:34:57] up to those and believe that the same
[1:34:59] God is the same Supernatural one that
[1:35:01] can bring those things and take apart
[1:35:02] all the knots and untie all the problems
[1:35:05] and set everything in order and get it
[1:35:06] just right in time for the Rapture it's
[1:35:08] just one thing on top of the other and
[1:35:10] the faith for what he we have today will
[1:35:12] be the faith that we need for the thing
[1:35:14] tomorrow cuz he'll do this one and he'll
[1:35:16] bring it to pass and that prepares us
[1:35:17] for the next one and the next one and
[1:35:18] the next one and all of a sudden the
[1:35:20] believer saying all things are possible
[1:35:22] every time I pray he does it every time
[1:35:25] I take him at his word he does it why
[1:35:27] should I not believe this though it's
[1:35:29] greater than anything I believed I know
[1:35:31] he'll do it cuz he keeps doing it he
[1:35:33] never stops he never fails he never
[1:35:35] leaves me he never forsakes me amen
[1:35:38] Faith gives us rest experience gives us
[1:35:42] refreshing Amen brother Braham says this
[1:35:45] he says now he said in Mark 16 go ye
[1:35:48] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:35:50] demonstrate the power in other words he
[1:35:52] says demonstrate the power and these
[1:35:55] signs shall follow them that accept the
[1:35:56] gospel see not just say intellectual
[1:35:59] words no no they couldn't do that with
[1:36:02] ual word intellectual words that word
[1:36:05] has to be made flesh manifested it has
[1:36:08] to the Holy Spirit came down on Christ
[1:36:11] and it manifested the fullness of God in
[1:36:13] him and then on the day of Pentecost you
[1:36:15] got a little lick and I got a little
[1:36:17] lick that's what it was just a taste of
[1:36:19] it just of our portion but it's there to
[1:36:21] manifest the life of it it's there to
[1:36:24] manifest the word of God inside of us he
[1:36:26] said see these signs shall follow them
[1:36:28] that believe in my name they'll cast out
[1:36:30] Devils they'll speak with new tongues
[1:36:31] they'll take up serpents and drink
[1:36:33] deadly things lay hands on the sick and
[1:36:35] they shall recover they'll demonstrate
[1:36:37] the power of the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:36:40] word made
[1:36:41] manifest it can't be a cold formal
[1:36:44] church I don't believe we have one but
[1:36:47] it can't just be all Doctrine and
[1:36:49] teaching it's got to be light life it's
[1:36:52] got to be the word living in you and I
[1:36:54] we're meant to do it we're built for it
[1:36:56] we're ordained for it we're
[1:36:57] predestinated for it he says these
[1:37:00] things I'm telling you will come to pass
[1:37:02] like the quickening word come to pass
[1:37:05] you have the power of the holy spirit in
[1:37:07] you it's not you it's the Holy Spirit
[1:37:10] doing it see now to Be an Effective
[1:37:12] witness of God you have to have the Holy
[1:37:15] Ghost because without the Holy Ghost you
[1:37:18] can't make that
[1:37:20] live you know I remember brother Tim
[1:37:23] puit saying 10 15 years ago and I went
[1:37:25] to their camps and they were wonderful
[1:37:27] things but he says we're making a shift
[1:37:29] because he says people need the Holy
[1:37:31] Ghost people have good teaching and good
[1:37:33] doctrines and good Ministries but they
[1:37:35] need the Holy Ghost because without that
[1:37:37] they're never going to make it and
[1:37:38] they've made that real shift towards
[1:37:40] getting them to the Holy Ghost but it's
[1:37:42] got to be a
[1:37:43] living it's not just an experience it's
[1:37:46] not just em motion it's just not just
[1:37:47] shouting cuz they have lots of that too
[1:37:50] not just lots of places in camps we've
[1:37:52] been to camps for those of you that
[1:37:54] lived in the states perhaps you see this
[1:37:56] more and you see the same people come to
[1:37:58] camp and they never changed they'd
[1:37:59] always have the same experience but they
[1:38:00] go out and they they come back the next
[1:38:02] year the same way have an experience go
[1:38:03] out come in and they'd never get the
[1:38:04] victory why they didn't get the Holy
[1:38:06] Ghost they just got an
[1:38:07] experience an emotional experience I'm
[1:38:10] not saying it wasn't Supernatural but it
[1:38:12] wasn't an infilling their life didn't
[1:38:14] change and it's a lifechanging that
[1:38:16] happens when the Holy Ghost comes in I
[1:38:18] don't care whether or not you speak in
[1:38:19] tongues I don't care whether you Shou in
[1:38:21] dance but your life has to change and
[1:38:24] it's to bring overcoming power and it's
[1:38:26] to produce the word in every one of our
[1:38:28] Lives amen you know what you'll do he
[1:38:31] says if you don't get the Holy Ghost he
[1:38:32] says you know what you'll do you'll take
[1:38:34] some intellectual Giants idea about it
[1:38:37] and bypass it and say that was just for
[1:38:41] the
[1:38:42] apostles we've got it today in this
[1:38:44] message it's all word word word and
[1:38:47] there's no
[1:38:48] life no love no no overcoming power but
[1:38:53] they can talk your ear off that's not
[1:38:55] the Holy Ghost that's intellectual
[1:39:00] formalism
[1:39:02] amen what's he saying it's not you doing
[1:39:05] it it's not me doing it it's Christ in
[1:39:08] you doing it amen it's the word Christ
[1:39:11] the word living breathing speaking
[1:39:12] moving in Us by the Holy Spirit and
[1:39:15] that's the only way that he's going to
[1:39:17] have these sorts of effects in our lives
[1:39:19] as if it's him in us not us trying to do
[1:39:21] without it we're stuck with an
[1:39:22] intellectual conception early on in my
[1:39:25] Ministry you
[1:39:26] know you get up there and you preach and
[1:39:28] the first time you're so nervous and
[1:39:30] you're just trying to get through it
[1:39:32] frankly but it's an intellectual thing
[1:39:34] the first time even if you I'm not
[1:39:36] saying I'm not anointed or wasn't
[1:39:37] anointed or these things but you're just
[1:39:39] trying to get through it and you're just
[1:39:40] trying to bring a thought but that's not
[1:39:42] enough long term it can be instructive
[1:39:45] it can help the people but I had to come
[1:39:46] to a place where I'm anointed to speak
[1:39:49] and what's coming over is him not just
[1:39:51] me amen and that's the same way with us
[1:39:55] where no matter where we're at it's not
[1:39:56] just for Ministry but it's for every
[1:39:58] child of God where our life is lived
[1:40:01] because Christ is living through us and
[1:40:03] that's the way it is and day in and day
[1:40:05] out amen otherwise we're all talking no
[1:40:06] actions we all words and no life and
[1:40:09] that's a that's a Christian that never
[1:40:10] gets the victory they get lots of
[1:40:13] excuses and they get lots of Doctrine
[1:40:15] but they never get the victory they
[1:40:16] never get the love anden it's a
[1:40:18] miserable State cuz you never have
[1:40:20] everything that the word says you're
[1:40:21] supposed to have amen we're stuck there
[1:40:24] we need to get down and pray to God to
[1:40:26] break us out of that amen humble
[1:40:28] ourselves to the word but to those that
[1:40:30] have the Holy Spirit sometimes we get
[1:40:33] anxious we see the the signs of the
[1:40:36] times we see what's happening with
[1:40:38] Israel Israel is God's time clock church
[1:40:40] we are so close to
[1:40:42] midnight the world favor the last shred
[1:40:45] of it is hanging by a thread with the
[1:40:46] United States and that's about it maybe
[1:40:48] Great Britain that's it everybody else
[1:40:51] has turned their backs on Israel at this
[1:40:54] point and When The World Turns against
[1:40:56] them that's the end we are so close and
[1:41:00] we can sit there and say where's the god
[1:41:03] of Elijah where's the god of William
[1:41:05] brandham but it's going to be here a
[1:41:07] little and there a little just a little
[1:41:10] bit by bit don't miss the Simplicity of
[1:41:13] the work of God in your life don't miss
[1:41:16] what's happening Even in our midst the
[1:41:17] little bits that are there it's God
[1:41:20] moving in a bride and it's not a public
[1:41:23] show it's not a public show
[1:41:28] Amen brother Braham says this as we
[1:41:30] start to close he says think of it that
[1:41:32] people born of his spirit in a day like
[1:41:35] this in this great denominal age that we
[1:41:37] live and the Living God takes his living
[1:41:40] word and vindicates it personally this
[1:41:43] life that's in the word and The Germ
[1:41:46] that's in the seed the words of seed
[1:41:47] that a sewer went forth to seow and the
[1:41:49] life is Christ in the word personally in
[1:41:54] you brother Rah didn't come so it would
[1:41:56] all stay in him he came so that it would
[1:41:59] Quicken each and every one of us the
[1:42:01] life that was in that Prophet The
[1:42:02] anointing that was in the prophet the
[1:42:04] word that was in the prophet the
[1:42:06] attitude the anointing the spirit of
[1:42:08] that was supposed to come on a bride to
[1:42:10] do the exact same things that he was
[1:42:12] doing it's not an age of all works don't
[1:42:14] get me wrong it's not an age of all
[1:42:16] miracles but it was to produce a life
[1:42:18] yielded to the Holy Spirit where we
[1:42:20] couldn't influence where Satan will be
[1:42:23] bound because we won't give him it we
[1:42:25] won't even open the door he can't get in
[1:42:27] because we're so lost in Christ that
[1:42:29] hidden life we talked about he says it's
[1:42:32] vindicating something that you cannot do
[1:42:34] proving himself that it's not you but
[1:42:36] it's him and you've become a love slave
[1:42:38] to him to be a bride he said thanks be
[1:42:41] to the Living God who created the
[1:42:44] heavens and the Earth and all that's in
[1:42:45] the midst no wonder he is Alpha and
[1:42:47] Omega the beginning and the ending he
[1:42:49] that was which is and shall come the
[1:42:51] root The Offspring of David the bright
[1:42:53] and Morning Star he is all in all his
[1:42:57] presence in the individual with a
[1:43:00] personal Vindication of himself
[1:43:02] expressing himself The Living Word
[1:43:05] that's promised for the day expressing
[1:43:07] itself through you a Vindication of the
[1:43:11] great revelation of
[1:43:14] God the Book of Revelation is an end
[1:43:16] time book it's a bride book it's only
[1:43:18] for the end John understood it nobody
[1:43:22] else did John had to seal it up and it
[1:43:24] wasn't open until
[1:43:26] 1963 and it was open to a people because
[1:43:29] it's her book why because she is the
[1:43:32] last revelation of Jesus
[1:43:35] Christ that's the mystery that's being
[1:43:37] revealed right now is Christ in you and
[1:43:39] everybody misses it very few people will
[1:43:42] ever see it but it's literally the
[1:43:44] personal expression of Christ in you
[1:43:46] revealing a portion of the word to this
[1:43:48] dead and dying age amen
[1:43:51] that's what's going on here that's the
[1:43:53] rest that we have amen my name is
[1:43:55] written in the word my name is written
[1:43:56] in the Lamb's Book of Life and that
[1:43:58] means that there's a life that's got to
[1:43:59] come out of my life there's a life
[1:44:01] that's got to come out of your life
[1:44:02] because he's built it into us to do it
[1:44:03] and be
[1:44:04] it so don't pull back don't pull back
[1:44:09] this is your book this is your word and
[1:44:13] if you recognize your time and your
[1:44:15] season and your message then you can
[1:44:17] step right into it and put your name
[1:44:19] next to every promise of there and say
[1:44:21] I'm going to rest on it it's mine but it
[1:44:25] does you no good if you don't put your
[1:44:26] feet on it and it does you no good if
[1:44:28] you don't ever read the title deed amen
[1:44:31] when somebody dies and they leave a
[1:44:34] will as the saying goes where there's a
[1:44:36] will I want to be in it because if
[1:44:37] you're in the will you get something but
[1:44:39] you got to be there for the reading of
[1:44:41] the will and you got to know what
[1:44:42] belongs to you and then you can go get
[1:44:44] it amen but there's a rest that comes in
[1:44:46] knowing that your name is written in the
[1:44:48] title deed it's not just just the
[1:44:50] ministry it's not just brother so and so
[1:44:52] sister so- and so Dad Mom some great
[1:44:54] person no it's every child of God has a
[1:44:57] portion written and set aside for them
[1:44:59] amen and that's what's drawing us up
[1:45:01] it's the word inside of Us coming out to
[1:45:03] claim what belongs to us to produce the
[1:45:05] word to produce Christ Living and alive
[1:45:08] today and my labor is to find that place
[1:45:11] of rest where I trust him and him alone
[1:45:15] remember we read that quote where it
[1:45:16] says people want to hold on to
[1:45:18] everything and then take Jesus what
[1:45:21] we're doing is we're letting go of
[1:45:22] everything that would hold us back and
[1:45:24] saying I'll trust him and him alone amen
[1:45:27] if the musicians would
[1:45:30] come as I read this last scripture it
[1:45:33] says God is our refuge and strength if
[1:45:36] we'd stand a very present help in time
[1:45:38] of trouble therefore will not we fear
[1:45:42] though the Earth be removed and though
[1:45:43] the mountains be carried into the midst
[1:45:45] of the sea though the waters thereof
[1:45:47] Roar and be troubled and though the
[1:45:49] mountain shake with the swelling thereof
[1:45:50] and then he says sa pause and think
[1:45:53] about
[1:45:54] it think about your life think about
[1:45:56] where you're at think about what's going
[1:45:58] on does it seem troubled the world is
[1:46:00] certainly troubled the economy's
[1:46:02] troubled the politics are troubled the
[1:46:05] schools are
[1:46:06] troubled everything's
[1:46:09] troubled and Satan's trying to trouble
[1:46:11] us he's trying to get things roiled up
[1:46:13] and he's trying to get us looking at it
[1:46:15] and he says David says God is our refuge
[1:46:17] and strength think about that he doesn't
[1:46:19] say think about how the mountains are
[1:46:21] all falling down and the seas are
[1:46:23] raging he says think about God as our
[1:46:26] refuge and strength a very present help
[1:46:28] in time of trouble he says there's a
[1:46:30] river the streams whereof shall make
[1:46:33] glad the city of God the holy place of
[1:46:35] the Tabernacles of the most high
[1:46:38] Tabernacles plural who's that you and I
[1:46:43] he says there's a holy place of God is
[1:46:45] you and I it's the collective body of
[1:46:47] Believers that's the Tabernacle of God
[1:46:49] and he says God is in in the midst of
[1:46:51] her she shall not be moved God shall
[1:46:54] help her and that right early that's our
[1:46:57] rest he's a very present help in the
[1:47:00] time of trouble he's a rock in a weary
[1:47:02] land he's a place of shade he's a place
[1:47:05] of provision he's a place of strength
[1:47:06] he's a place of food amen that can bring
[1:47:09] us it's not just rest in church it's not
[1:47:12] just rest in our bodies it's rest in our
[1:47:15] minds amen that we can lay our burdens
[1:47:18] down that we don't have to lay it night
[1:47:20] staring up into the ceiling wondering
[1:47:22] how's it going to work out how am I
[1:47:23] going to get here how am I going to do
[1:47:25] this how are we going to manage that why
[1:47:28] cuz God's in our midst that's his
[1:47:30] problem to carry we're supposed to lay
[1:47:32] that on him and say Lord you told me to
[1:47:36] cast my cares upon you I'm going to cast
[1:47:38] them on you and I'm going to take my
[1:47:40] rest while you sort it all out Amen
[1:47:43] brother R says this he says it reminds
[1:47:46] me of a German painting in Germany the
[1:47:48] German painting is called the CL cloud
[1:47:51] and when you're away from this picture
[1:47:52] it's the most miserable dismal looking
[1:47:54] sight it's a bunch of clouds just mixing
[1:47:57] together and as you start walking to
[1:47:59] that picture it gives you a horror oh
[1:48:02] what a dreadful sight it looks he says
[1:48:04] but when you get close to it it's
[1:48:06] angel's wings beating together he says
[1:48:08] see it looks different when you get
[1:48:11] there but you got to get close enough to
[1:48:13] see
[1:48:16] it we've talked about fear fear is
[1:48:19] something that hasn't yet happened
[1:48:22] yet but you think it's going to happen
[1:48:24] you're worried it's going to
[1:48:26] happen and in the distance it always
[1:48:28] looks so bad doesn't
[1:48:30] it he says let it get real before you
[1:48:33] start determining whether it's a bad
[1:48:35] thing or a good thing maybe let it
[1:48:37] happen before you start dwelling on
[1:48:39] it he says maybe that's the way it is
[1:48:42] with you tonight you don't know just why
[1:48:44] you're sick but maybe it's a blessing in
[1:48:48] disguise you say brother John I'm not
[1:48:49] sick put your problem there put your
[1:48:52] struggle there put your trial there put
[1:48:53] what's got you roiled up there he says
[1:48:55] maybe it's a blessing in disguise it
[1:48:57] looks like a gloomy dark end for you but
[1:49:00] it may be the angel wings beating
[1:49:02] together if you're only certain of God
[1:49:05] he says you're sure that God heals the
[1:49:06] sick and if you're sure that God still
[1:49:09] pours out the Holy Ghost upon his people
[1:49:11] then take his promise and hold on to it
[1:49:14] until God answers for he sure will
[1:49:17] answer prayer now notice the title be
[1:49:21] certain of
[1:49:22] God Amen I like that be certain of God
[1:49:26] know that God is real know that he hears
[1:49:30] know that he cares see certainly
[1:49:33] certainty brings us
[1:49:34] courage like I said before if we knew
[1:49:37] that we were going to win if we truly
[1:49:38] knew truly believed that we're going to
[1:49:40] win every battle we'd face the battles a
[1:49:42] lot
[1:49:42] differently but C but but that certainty
[1:49:45] gives us courage even boldness as we go
[1:49:48] into these times of Trials and these
[1:49:49] times of or things don't don't look so
[1:49:51] good amen but that certainty it comes
[1:49:53] when Faith becomes sight like I said you
[1:49:56] get that once the next time it's a
[1:49:57] little easier and it's a little easier
[1:49:59] and it's a little easier but you still
[1:50:00] got to feed you still got to keep
[1:50:02] looking you still got to keep dwelling
[1:50:03] amen but you see God prove himself once
[1:50:05] and then you can say he'll prove himself
[1:50:07] again and again and again and again amen
[1:50:11] we look so often at troubles and we say
[1:50:13] why
[1:50:15] me why me I did everything right we
[1:50:19] don't but you know what I mean we do
[1:50:21] everything as right as we
[1:50:23] can and yet things still
[1:50:25] happen sickness health issues we get old
[1:50:29] we get broke we get
[1:50:32] tired we get
[1:50:34] troubled offended persecuted even what
[1:50:39] is
[1:50:40] it God's got to prove himself in every
[1:50:44] way and he does it through our lives
[1:50:47] can't know he's a deliverer unless you
[1:50:48] need Deliverance can't can't know he's a
[1:50:50] Healer unless you need healing can't
[1:50:52] know he's a provider unless you need
[1:50:53] provision and God's trying to prove
[1:50:55] himself real in every way that we need
[1:50:58] now so that when it comes to the end
[1:51:00] we'll believe him and walk right off of
[1:51:01] this Earth and say he's the god of the
[1:51:03] Rapture same as he's the god of my
[1:51:05] healing and the god of my provision and
[1:51:07] the god of my deliverance and the god of
[1:51:08] my guidance and all of these different
[1:51:10] things amen there's a rest available for
[1:51:12] the believer and it comes with knowing
[1:51:15] that he's the god of your
[1:51:18] life that when we walk out of the doors
[1:51:20] tonight he's going right there with you
[1:51:23] that you can close your eyes and you can
[1:51:26] go to him and you can say Lord I'm your
[1:51:29] child and I'm trusting you and I'm
[1:51:32] believing you and I'm waiting on you
[1:51:35] until you move in my life and my
[1:51:36] situation and then brother Braham says
[1:51:38] you stay there and he will sure answer
[1:51:43] prayer amen God bless you let's bow our
[1:51:46] heads Heavenly
