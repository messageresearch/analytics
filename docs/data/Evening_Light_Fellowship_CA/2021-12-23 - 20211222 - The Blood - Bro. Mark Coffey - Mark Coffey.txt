gerald lord and remember brother john we just asked lord your grace to them and be with us all we pray in jesus name amen you may be seated so just to give all my conditions here first this is this is all this all was quick and um you know so it's just put together i'm filling in for paul for sunday school and uh so this was kind of a carryover the next next uh he's gone for a month so i was filling in and we've done one already and this was going to be the second one on this subject so i did have some notes so i had to quickly at 12 o'clock uh put all these uh things uh uh together and uh it was quick so i just put in all those uh things first before we start so i was just gonna you know look at the uh the general principles here of the the scriptures we did talk last time in the sunday school about election and we talk about predestination and just those basic things that are in the message and in the word so we just want to one of the things was the blood which is the just definitely a basic component of all of this and just to help us understand these things so here we uh we want to so we want to understand you know it with these topics the the the uh uh really the to understand the foundation of which the everything is built on so i need my i'll get organized here yet this is probably not on is it takes a second okay so here just looking here in in genesis as we start with we talk about blood sacrifices and unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them so it's it's talking about the sin that was in the garden of eden and we know that uh you know god set it up so that there wasn't any any blood but only when the sin was caused in the garden that they did come in with a blood sacrifice and there's no different today and the most important thing to remember is that you need a blood sacrifice and that did not change you know we're under that ever since the beginning so i uh so with this you know god has to see you clothed in in a sacrifice and the only sacrifice is blood so if i go here and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission that's basic so that didn't change with jesus christ our our sacrifice was the blood that was shed on crop on the cross and for the life of and in leviticus 17 11 for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul so the life is in the blood and that's why it had to be a fact a living sacrifice that had to die for your sin that's pretty basic all of us should know that anyway but the life is in that blood so when that blood it comes out of that sacrifice it's it's dead and it and it's a remission for your sins and in the old testament it was only for a year because it was an animal blood it wasn't it wasn't the blood they could not be redeemed by any anybody's blood it had to be an animal because no one could be a redeemer because everyone was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lie so it was trapped there in the old testament there was no one to do it and that gets me ahead so so here adam and eve you see sinned in the garden just to go through the through the first part in genesis and what did god do god performed the first sacrifice he went down with his daily daily uh a routine to go down to the the adam and eve in the garden and adam adam uh and he called for me couldn't find him and he said you know when he saw him he said you're naked and that was a you know the uh the giveaway point was that you know they were naked and they knew these things they had a revelation of something that they never had a revelation before since the last visit right so so that's what triggered them there is that they were naked and adam had adam had brother brian kind of alludes that brother man had access to brother brown adam had access to heaven you know he he could see these things and he could see he had ac of course he had control of the whole earth he had the deed and he was in control of the whole earth he wasn't in control of anything else it was just the earth it's not like he could he had control of the moon or something he didn't he just had control of the earth so so he could he could go back and forth it seemed you know in heaven and i that's not surprising because brother branham could a prophet could he could you know see things in heaven and see you know when he went on behind beyond the curtain of time so i'm sure adam did as the first son but eve didn't have that it seemed uh brother branham alludes you know she she didn't have that knowledge you know he did he knew he knew that when it happened he knew that you know that there was going to be a penalty here for this he understood it he understood the covenant there with the tree of life but she uh she didn't she only knew it by experience she she understood it then that okay this is this is not good and then of course we know that adam went with eve and because he was going to save her and it was a type of christ saving his bride and his life and his dna ended up in in eve and that because part of him was in her that god couldn't take her life right so that's what happened so so what he had to do was he had to to slay those those innocent animals and he had to and brother branham says they walked out of eden with those skins around them and it was slapping on their legs and blood was dripping down and they were covered with those skins and that that is and so god when he looked down at them he didn't see he didn't see the sin because if he sees the sin in that time he it would be death you know uh and we don't see it in our age because we're under grace so there's people who are walking around without us without a sacrifice and enveloped in a sacrifice for their sins that god cannot see and so believers ourselves you know we we had that covering and if you read that interview that private interview interview that's that i gave out last time uh to the sunday school class he's talking with sister georgia bruce and it was before a sermon and uh it must have been uh recorded accidentally anyway they they transcribed it and it's about two pages long and it it's talking to the sister who she feels she's asking brother branham various questions but you know am i saved you know and he explains about that that god when he looks down at you sister he he only sees the blood he doesn't see your sins because you're covered with the blood right and you have to be like that and there's there's if he didn't then he he has to bring judgment upon that person but like i said in this age he doesn't because we're under grace and uh so what happens is is when you leave this earth and you don't have that sin covering you go to a not so good place you go to hell right and you wait until your judgment and that's where you'll you'll stay and then if you're found guilty at the judgment then you are go go into the lake of fire but the believer doesn't because he doesn't have that sin he he goes into to uh into that six dimension with uh you know underneath the seventh dimension where god god is waiting for the rapture really of all the church that's where we go but once grace finishes on this earth that's it god comes and he'll destroy he'll destroy because he has no covering and death i guess we we just basically pretty well understand that so adam knew that death was the answer and um and that you know they had left the garden and they uh they had no longer access to the garment and things changed things changed the line that was nice to them is not nice to them no more and they they really became adam would become like us and like you would you know uh not have that mediator anymore between you and you would you would uh not be sure that god is speaking to you or not being i'm sure adam went into that mode you know he wasn't sure all the time and he had to make sure however we make sure and that's the way it was you know and of course uh you know that made it we can relate to that for sure so here he went and found two animals as i said and god killed those animals then he took the skins of those animals and he wrapped adam and eve with skins and that was the first sacrifice because without the shedding of blood there is no remission i should have just clicked this blood had had to be shed doesn't change it hasn't changed since that's the covenant we're under god had said this day you eat thereof that day you die something had to die something had to pay the price and it had to be blood because why in leviticus the life was in the blood god could could have taken adam and eve and smitten them dead but they would but where would the rest of god's seed come from so he couldn't eliminate those because that's where you know it started and this that's where the life was going to come for the rest of the population of the earth they were all supposed to come through adam and eve and god took the animals and killed them and he took the skins and he wrapped his children in those skins they left the garden of eden like that and then when god looked at adam and eve what did he see he saw the sacrifice this is a this is our first review he saw that there was a blood atonement for their sins it didn't go away with their sins but it covered their sins so their sins still remain but they still had to do with sacrifice every time why because that it was only the blood of an animal and the life couldn't go back on the person to to to redeem them the blood they couldn't pay the price they couldn't fully pay the price god just accepted the sacrifice for a year which happened for four thousand years right through the law the blood of jesus christ is greater than that because it actually does does away with the sin and in the beginning god gave us the type from which everything else has to flow we have to be wrapped in our sacrifice you can raise your hand and accept jesus christ as your savior and that's the beginning of your process brother brian says if you raise your hand and accept jesus christ as your savior and you die at that point you have salvation but there is a progression in the life of a christian right there is a that's a start there is a progression you know you have to get to that last point which is adoption and you get the you get the authority of god in your life right you go from accepting christ as your savior and you're convicted of your sins and you begin to sanctify your life and you do a lot of that work through the help of you know the holy spirit right going through there and you start to clean your life up and make it more acceptable unto god and that's part of the that process and the progression of the life of a christian and we should have all experienced that but we're all at different levels and the holy spirit is working in our lives amen and that's good see where i am here usually with the sunday school i do give out a handout and a lot of this is the handout so i'm just gonna i'm using it here so cain also uh wanted to watch cain and abel also wanted to worship worship god and and cain did as well and kane is almost like he was a hard worker and he was a worker in the field he was almost like esau he reminded me of esau and a part of them desired this and came uh abel kept to sheep and kane worked in the field and he knew and and and cain uh and abel knew that it was blood he had the revelation that it was blood and and but god and god had respect unto abel when he's when god accepts that sacrifice he gives respect unto that person right you know and when you say when you uh accept it you know he has respect unto you and why did why did uh god refuse uh because it shows election and the only access i have to god is through jesus christ that's the only access through the blood he god sees the blood and only through the blood that i can even approach him and it's through through the sacrifice on calvary and if i have a need i go to calvary i go back to calgary we can never forget calvary calvary is the most important thing everything was done at calgary calgary cavalry calvary everything was done there i for i didn't forget i just forgot how to say it that's the difference so you know when you know we we are entitled to everything that christ died for you know at calvary so if he if you uh read isaiah 53 and he was he you know by stripes were healed you know those stripes that he took on that day you know we were healed by that we can claim that everything that he died for there he he i thought you had a question then uh i you know you can claim every everything that he he uh he said he died for then right you can go back there any time it doesn't matter and he will honor it right he will honor it if you ask and that's where you go you still go to calgary calgary cavalry calvary i'll never forget it he's translating all that is he so anyway with noah the next was noah and just not going to spend much time here i know but god brought that rain on no it was a it was a destruction it was a judgment and you know and in that case there uh with noah he uh you know he he had destroyed the earth by by water and he had promised that he wouldn't do that anymore and then when he looked down when it when it rains now and he looks down he he there's a there's a rainbow i saw one the other day and when he looks and he looks through that rainbow and he reminds him of his covenant so you know that's what that's what happened in in that day so he's under that and we're under that covenant still today so with job job sat down on the ashes so 9 30 30 33. he didn't know what was wrong job didn't know what was wrong there was a conversation in heaven between god and satan and he didn't and they they knew what was going on but job didn't know what was going on true through all his trials and judgments and everything that he went through and he he ended up he ended up sitting on those ashes from the sacrifices right because he believed that he was he was covered he had done what god required right and and that's where he stood and sat in those ashes and threw ashes on himself and dealt with all his uh other people who came visit so if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean yet shall thou plunge me in the ditch and my own clothes shall afford me if he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither is there any days man be betwixt us that might lay his hand upon his book both what's a daiseman anybody know it's a mediator right he didn't have a mediator so it was him and god and he there was no one in between and he thought he had done the sacrifice but now he didn't know and he said if i had a mediator to explain this to me right in genesis it says and behold the word of god came unto him saying thou shalt not be thine air but he he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine ear and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he was believed in the lord and accounted it to him in righteousness right talk about abraham here here's my notice my animations now god uh so with job he went to the place where he offered his sacrifices to god because that's where that's what he relied on right and god made a covenant with abraham but with abraham it was all unconditional talking about this genesis 15. so that that is the covenant that we're under now right we're not under the law the law ended on calvary right at that day that's the law was over the old testament was over the new testament started on pentecost right and it all ended there that covenant and the old covenant and the new covenant so there was there was no adam was abraham never never had a conditional covenant up to that time and almost every time since there was a condition so if you do this then this will happen if you sin you will be well you have to pay for that sin right but abraham never never did that although he was in the flesh and he still had a sacrifice he still had to do that part of it but his condition his covenant that he had with god was was not quite so we see in in there and i won't read it but you see they had the the agreement and when in the in in those times when they had an agreement they would take an animal and sacrifice an emerald cut it in two and they would sit in between it and they would make their covenant whatever it is however they had it and they would tear it and one would have the other and then if you went against that covenant you would be like that dead animal on the side that would be your punishment right if that happened right but in this case you remember when he when he sat down with abraham in that in that scene in genesis you know abraham went to sleep and because god did it all you know there was still the sacrifice and everything but abraham didn't partake because he had no there's nothing he had to do it was going to be done and it's because he believed right and and we're under that covenant now we're under because of the royal seed that was given to the raw seed and we're under the royal seed so we have to come it's unconditional we it's totally totally in god's hands as long as we believe so the thing is that we have to do is believe right and if you believe you do what is expected of you right and he he you know he has respect unto you once you believe and adam could believe abraham could believe he didn't have any trouble believing there wasn't a time having made mistakes but we if we go to hebrews 11 and there's no mistakes there right he doesn't look through that he looks through that covenant and that sacrifice and he saw abraham as righteous even then when he was dealing with with sarah and sarah laughed you know god said why did you laugh and then there was another point where abraham laughed and god didn't say nothing right because he was righteous so it all relied on god god god declared the whole covenant relied on god he made it with himself and do you think that was going to going to be broken if he makes a covenant with himself it's his word is never going to be broken and and we're that's what we rest on today we're under that covenant right you know if you read romans 4 god declared abraham righteous because you have believed the promises i am declaring you righteous from that point on abraham was always considered righteous and when you accept jesus christ god looks at you and you are righteous he has declared you righteous if he's already made the judgment call that you you are righteous then you are you are because he says you are it's not about it's not about you but it's about him whatever god gives you he'll never take away from you if he gives it to you if he gives you the holy ghost you'll never take it away you cannot he can't he will never take it back it's yours forever it's just like the lutherans they have justification once they gave them justification they still believe in justification they're still justified and they will never take it back now they didn't move on but they didn't the methodists you know and sanctification they still have it they believe it they'll preach it they still do it and god counts it to them for righteousness right because they didn't believe it you know in those days right and they still believe it today and same with the pentecost they had the the gifts of the holy ghost right they didn't have the person but they had the the gifts of the person right in that day and they still hadn't right we all know that right and he'll never take him back he'll never take it back and you have the token the token life it's the person the person of god right and he'll never take it back if you've got it you never have to worry about god taking anything like that back and that's a blessing blessing and if you have the holy ghost he says you're sealed until the day of your redemption you are sealed you have the holy ghost and all you have all you have to have is the holy ghost and how do you get the holy ghost acts 2 38 hasn't changed right and it's still today so now we get to the law talking about the blood sacrifice right just the focus here today for thou art and holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself we can put ourselves into that in this covenant in the new covenant he's talking about the old covenant here now the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people it sounds familiar but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers has the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of abandonment for the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and redeemed that means to take take away from the control that you're in and take you out of that right so that's what that's for redemption god didn't call us because we're the biggest number of people or because we're the richest of people for sure right but we're in the mind of god right we're in the mind of god in the beginning and he he calls you up because he loves you he loves you why else would he do he he didn't have any other reason only that he loved you he called us because he loved us as i said when you look at predestination why does god love you it's because you're part of him right we went through that in our sunday school in exodus and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all those words which the lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the lord has spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord so that was their covenant so everything that you said we would do we will do that's if then right else you know so it's not not like abraham this wasn't you know this was a different covenant they wouldn't believe so he set up a law so they would further try to understand god and he just dumped it on them with the 100 614 rules and they could never keep it they could never keep it all and there was no redemption there was no redemption in it because it was the same sacrifice year over year over year it would go on for eternity there was no way because there was no one able to redeem to redeem the law was imperfect the law never dealt with the problem of redemption the law merely showed what god was like and it took six thousand years to show what god was like right you know especially it is established a priesthood and the priesthood became a mediator so the so that's what god established in the law was a mediator someone between god and man right and that was the priest now we see what happened that became the one that joel was looking for that day star right that he didn't have but it was imperfect because the priest never fully comprehended god the priest really didn't do a great job at this they could never really comprehend the magnitude of god's judgment and his wrath they did the best they could by reading and studying the law but if you start looking at the priesthood in the old testament you find that they failed miserably in their job right you see all the things that were written about them in there and you know that they didn't they didn't fulfill what they were supposed to fulfill because they were human god had to raise up prophets he used the prophets then to bring the word because they couldn't count on the mediator to do it the priest so the prophets became the word because the priesthood had failed the government had failed everything had failed and god always has a voice in there he will always have a voice this is my no and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words and god commanded and all the people answered together and said all that the lord has spoken we will do i think i just read that tonight moses came down from the mountain and he rehearsed all the contract the law with the people the people made a statement all that the lord has spoken we will do there were there there were obligations that went with this covenant they said they will do it fine no problem he took the blood of the sacrifice and he sprinkled it upon the book upon the tabernacle upon the people and they were set apart for god for the sacrifice and that's what the blood does right the blood will will separate a people unto god right and in our day it's the same day it's the same thing in the new covenant the blood of jesus christ separates us right it separates us to god we're set apart for god so it's not the world and god it's god you know that's what that's what his expectation is by the sprinkling of the blood and we can't be bringing things in because eventually in our day god is gonna you've got the fullness of god in it's a token that's gonna be in you right the fullness of the life of god and so he is going to take control of you in this age that is that is what the prophet preached in the token it'll be the life of christ in us the full life not like pentecost that was only the the gifts part right it wasn't the full life it wasn't the full person it was the gifts of the person and in this age it will be the person and he he that means you will have to you will have to to uh die your your desires and your so that means you can't be in there with stuff that god doesn't want because he if you're still alive and you still have these desires that aren't his desires and you have these things that that are not what god expects because he you are separated unto god then he he will not come into you in in a fullness right you won't see that adoption in there he has to fully trust you in the last time so you can't bring things in with you and have these desires and you have a life to your own your life has to die your desires has to die so you have you have you have no desire for the the world and that's what he's saying because we're totally separated right we have to be in that in that in that way because god will not share the throne with you in you right he's only going to take it himself you have desire so so when it comes like we can't see the we can't see the future we can't see we can read the word or whatever and see what's god's going to happen but for my future i can't tell what i'm going to do you know i could look at you and say you got the holy ghost in it i wouldn't really know you know god doesn't god doesn't tell me you have to hold it looks like it but i don't really know god knows because he knows the future you could you could you you know you think someone's got the you've seen it in your own experience you've seen people and you think they got the holy ghost and they fall away and they couldn't have the holy ghost you know but we don't know it so you can't judge it you know you can't judge anybody it's only god knows and and god knows if you got the holy ghost and you know if you got the holy ghost and god doesn't tell anyone you know that you got it it's a it's a it's an individual affair so in this age you have to die you really have to die in this age because we'll come to a a period of adoption and adoption is your your name is under check right so the owner the owner the father has a business and he raises his son up they this is what brown uses as the example and he he authorizes it so that the son can write his name on the check and be just as good as the father so he has all the power and that's where we have to come right we have to come to that to that point where we can write our name on the check and if we say something then god will god make it come to pass right and you know branham had power in his life you could see it and and we talked about elijah you know elijah had power and when he he was uh tormented tormented by those children he called a bear out a couple of bears out to destroy those children he had power to do that and god permitted it burban said he shouldn't have right but he had power he had to hit the power to do that to speak it and it will come to pass right and brother brown had the same thing when he had those those kids in the those young people in the in the service and they were making out in the service and program said don't do that you know he said it three times and then the voice came to him and said you know whatever you say right and uh and he he said and he and it was quiet on the tape and he's thinking about it and he says i forgive you right and uh he he it was the same example as elijah with the children right you know it's something he didn't want to do but he had you have to have that those uh attributes of that humility and that control and all of those things in order to do that so so it's important and that's what we're trying to get to we're trying to get to where we have that power right hebrews for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of the calves and the goats and water with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkle both the book and the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god has enjoined unto you so we are separated unto god by the sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ they are obligat there are obligations to the covenant it's not uh it's not obligations like you have to do this or you have to do this and i'll do this it's not that kind of conditional kind of obligation it takes it takes and it separates us onto unto him and there's expectations around that right we're expected to do to to do as you know as abraham did is to believe to believe god believe the word right and follow the word but he's not going to lay it right out for you and once you separate unto god there are certain expectations of the life that you will live and the things you will do there are and brother brian explained those things to us and you know in order for us to have that power you have to read the bible and you have to listen to the message you know and you have to to and those things are what build up in you and and you know like if someone is reading their bible and listening to the message and praying right and he gave you the simplest things to do read your bible and pray but it's so hard especially in this age because there's so many spirits that have been led out into our environment and you see that in revelation 9. and hell was opened up and all of these evil spirits came in and they're tormenting you and it's hard for you to have this presence of god around you all the time it'll you know it's like when brother brown you know he used to call up people and they'd uh they'd come up to him and there's that presence around them there's no there's no spares in coming in that presence in brother madam in the prayer line right and he and people would feel it and he said you feel that oh yeah i feel that right and you know you feel it and you you have great faith you believe right and in all those things but when they walked away get out of that presence and then boo you know i i don't know if i'm healed or not you know and they had doubt you know and that was that's the spirit you know and that's what happens and you meet people and i don't know if you find it yourself but you know if you're reading and praying you know a lot of times you're sitting down and if you're having fellowship and someone is saying something even if it's someone in the world or whatever and they're saying something then the scriptures come to your mind and messi a quote comes to your mind and there's another scripture and another scripture and you say this and you think this and you think you're constantly this uh these things are just coming into your mind because it's part of it right but you see other people who aren't doing it and they're sitting there and they're quiet you know they might be natural quiet on time but that that that is like that but you know there's there's people just don't have really anything to say you know and you just wonder if you know that what they need to do is just get into the word and get into the praying and you know if and i know it's tough a lot of times you know you don't always have the time because it's so busy but you know you really got to fight you know that's a battle right that's the greatest battle right but in this age it's tough you know brother brown says it himself you know uh years before it was different you know pray all night and they'd have meetings pray all night and whatever you know is long gone and so no one says it's going to be easy but it's you know you know we're in that covenant of abraham and you can rest on that you know that's that's the company we're not under the law you know we're under the covenant of abraham as christians we're expected to live and conduct ourselves in certain ways and we don't bring and we don't bring an approach upon what we say to be the covenant that we live under i seem good i must pull up here my it's going to bring all this up here so in leviticus and uh just let me look at this and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and the brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger so we're talking about now rejec uh kinsman redeemer this is what we're talking about here so as i said in the in the old testament there was no way to redeem out of that covenant right you had to sacrifice every year every year every year because every every human is is uh uh you know has sinned right every every human has been born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies so there's no one that can redeem it out because there's no one like that and the only one is a kinsman redeemer would have to be a human who could who had no sin and we know who that was but so in the in leviticus it does have a scripture in there and a law that would take care of that so verse 48 and after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren may redeem him so if someone was sold and a relative could redeem him and in this case buy him ring either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him and his family may redeem him or if or if he be able he may redeem himself if he can do it so because the law was not perfect it had to come to a place where the law of redemption had to take effect the law of redemption was spelled out in the kinsman redeemer brother preached on that we familiar with that but who would redeem us everyone that is born is born in sin none of us redeem anybody else if we die we die for our own sins so how would we die for someone else's sins you know we can't because we're sinful right and that's the scene in in revelation 5 you know when there's the book is there and no one can take the book who can take the book and you know the prophets you know screamed out right but who could redeem us god had to come and become our kinsmen god had to take on human flesh and god in human flesh began to understand us god dwells in his realm and i imagine he had some inclination of what we were like you know so but he came right into our realm right so he understood things you know christ knew what it was like to lose a person they were close to like lazarus right you know he knew what it was like to be sick or tired or you know he learned those things god learned those things through being in that in that form of jesus christ right so god came down and he on the left and he came in jesus christ oh no at the end now we have a mediator we actually have someone that can sit there between us and god and he can reconcile us to to the two so now we have me all in the new in the old testament they didn't right they brought in the law they brought in priests but that didn't work right they had to bring prophets to straighten up the priests but in in this case now in when christ came on the scene there was a kinsmen redeemer so there was a way out and we reconciled through the blood of jesus christ so here's the whole world in sin and the only way that it could be redeemed is that some there had to be a sacrifice for people's sin and it couldn't be an animal because that wasn't that wasn't long term it was only for a year but if you had a person who had no sin and that life could go back on the person then the sins are purged forever past present future and that's what this this world need great design and he can reconcile us too we reconciled through the blood of jesus christ because that paid the price for our redemption that's the only thing that could pay the price according to leviticus 25. we reconciled through the blood of jesus christ because that paid the price of our redemption so the blood that was in christ that life that was in the blood of christ could come back on the believers we call it the holy ghost right to come back and and bring us to another level right it could reconcile us with god so christ was the mediator so that god could see us through the blood of a of a of jesus christ we reconciled through the blood of jesus christ because that paid the price for our redemption so that that need for the bloodside never changed it still is the same it was always the same god said it has to be the same rate to the end right that was the final thing which was necessary to bring us into the very presence of god until christ died it was not possible for a man to come for a man to approach into the presence of god it was not possible until jesus christ it very really there and the lord said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all the catalan above every beast of the field upon the belly shall though go and dust shall thou eat all the days of his life genesis 3 and i will put an enmity between thee and the people and between thy seed and her seed and it will bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel she she didn't have a seed right a woman doesn't have a sea seed has to be put into her but god himself formed within mary what was necessary to bring forth the body that god could come in he became the woman's seed and god was his father philippians who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god he was equal with god he was god he was god he was god in human flesh john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's god god is the word right he was god if he wasn't god then he wouldn't he he he doesn't have salvation if he wasn't god then he we have nothing if you don't believe that jesus christ was the son of god and his blood wasn't sufficient for our sin then you have nothing right if you believe that many believe it does people in the message be everything rests upon the sacrifice everything without exception amen romans 5 17-19 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and not the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation that was in the garden with adam even by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners but by the obedience of one christ shall many be made righteous right you are not righteous because of what you do you are righteous because of what he did there is no right you have no righteousness right it's not about us it's about him it's what he did so here it's just i've just shown that each one of these lines is a is just every year you know and there had been a sacrifice that they had a priest as a mediator and those blood sacrifices were every year but there was no end to it right there had had to be the the law that the law of redemption had to come into practice the kinsmen redeemer because the law couldn't take away sin the law could not redeem the law could take take by offering a sacrifice but the law would only cover sin for a year the priest would take the sin and roll it over to the next year in the next year on a day of atonement the priest would go in there and put the blood on the mercy seat and the sins would roll over by the next year then they would have to do that every year the sacrifice the animals didn't do the job it did not redeem the blood of jesus christ did what the law could not do i'm just going fast here just because we kind of touched that in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace in ephesians we have that redemption true to blood in colossians 1 giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life who had delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins right so paul teaching there that with that mediator the true mediator the true kinsman redeemer you know we have redemption we're not under that bondage anymore we're redeemed we're not under the control of something anymore of sin right and we have the life of god in us through the blood because the life is in the blood and the forgiveness of all our sins since we did the sins we doing the sins we will do in the future is all covered by the blood god doesn't see it he just looks down he sees the sacrifice he sees the blood of jesus christ and you see it in revelation 1 and you see jesus in there for the church ages mediating right right here you know so these are connected these verses when he died he only paid for our sins but he he not only paid for our sins but he redeemed us redeemed is to purchase and bring us back he brought us back into fellowship with god that's what reckless reconciliation is all about taking two opposing forces and taking them and bringing them back where they can have union and fellowship once again right so everything changed in year in that in the time when jesus was on the earth the whole thing was reversed that's what the blood of jesus christ did and then when jesus was on the cross he said his last words it is finished what was finished it was the plan of redemption it was finished satan had no control anymore right that's what the blood of jesus christ did but jesus wasn't finished he still had to go through you know the the uh seven church ages and that others but that segment of it was finished you know of his uh you know kinsmen redeemer function where he would be on the earth in flesh right of man that's what the blood of jesus christ did god used our redeemer he was the sacrifice for our sin he was the one that made it possible for us to get back into god colossians 1 13 who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son amen you are no longer have to listen to the darkness you no longer have to listen to what satan tries to tell you turn him off how do you turn them off get into christ you get into christ and there's no receiving station for satan so if if you've got half of christ you know half of you is you know focused on that then you get half but if you get full you got you got the power you start praising him and worshipping him and all of a sudden there is a barrier satan's transmitting all the time but you get into him into christ and all of a sudden you shut it all off right and you can you can distance yourself from that he still attacked the flesh but it becomes less and less and that you're you're made more aware of it all the time and how he does it that's gonna i had a piece in there but i'm gonna skip that so i i went through this last sunday it was uh it was regarding election and it's just a story that that brother branham tells and i just want to use it just to show like you know there's brother brown used it as a if you heard him tell a story he he talked about the yard goods and he said he was explaining election and he put a god put a pattern down and this is the mind of god and that pattern was the elect that's who he chose that's the elect right and the rest it was the same material but it was he called it the remnant so we would call it the wise versions and the full foolish versions of water right here but it was all god's seed and and it was here it was it was all the same material but the remnant never came to the to receive the holy ghost so they didn't go in the rapture and it's the same as matthew 25 and 1-13 where they came to the end and some had oil and some didn't have oil and uh i just for the next part there i just wanted to show it and i i just put it up here is what berber brown said before the foundation of the world in the mind of god he took one piece of goods and he lays it out and he lays a pattern of election on that and all inside the pattern our election and everything outside of pattern is remnant but it's all the same material it's all god it was all in god's mind and if it was it was in god's mind it's eternal and it will always be right it can't be it it'll go back to god in the end it's just the one doesn't get the moisture the moisture is a person the difference between pentecost head and what we've had under the opening of the seals is one is a gift and and under the opening of the seals one is a person one is the gift of the person the other is the person himself the only way the whole person is in you is if you are if you are dead to yourself token life the whole person is in you if you're dead and that's because he's not going to share a throne with you he will not share a throne with you you have to die inside yourself so your desires are gone for what i want right so if you're saying well i'm gonna go uh and do this and this well you know that could be your desire it might not be his desire right so you sit back and you say the lord willing right and you say lord i'm not sure which path to take here if you could help me you know just like david waited for the moving of the the mulberry trees right and then he went when he saw them all he's when he he went when he saw god move and show him where to go right and where we have to become to that like i want to do this and i want to do that and after a while uh well you could get down a rough road like that right and we've all done because of our desires this is why i saw this and someone's doing this and i want to do this well that's not the way it is for the adopted sons and daughters of god right the ones who have died you know in this world you're born again by believing every word of god read your bible and pray and that's not easy is it it was it was a god this is just swinging over a little bit now and it's almost coming to an end here but it's just changing a little bit here that's why i used that there it was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation brother brahms talking about new creation man and god met with met and joined he was the first of this new new race he is the head of this new race first second corinthians therefore if any man being christ he is a new creation because god is making a new creation all things have passed away behold all things have become new but now he is stan from the laodicean church age but now he is standing in the midst of the church and he stands there revealing who he is in the last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god i just thought this was interesting this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of the church the heavenly reichroom created his own bride and the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his baby was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supplied by mary god created you for this day for this hour so he can manifest himself through you that's the whole plan and we see that in christ the mystery of god revealing the three things he wanted to do he manifest through a person on the earth and then through a church god created you for this day he created you for this time you were to come to the very image of god that the very image of him that's guaranteed that will happen because there's a remnant that's going to make it i mean there's a bride that's going to go in the rapture in the pattern these ones are elected to go there's nothing can stop them there's nothing you know if you look at the judgment in in in revelation 20 that they're they're up with christ right they're not in being judged they don't get judged they were they they they already received their judgment and they were in christ and received their judgments romans 81 they have no condemnation so he will not lose one of them he said if i got 19 1999 i will not lose that other one there's a special group that he has that it's not whosoever will they they won't have a choice they will make it and if if you're part of that elect and if you are you know a renegade of some type or you don't do what god does god will take you home you know and you'll lose your reward you know in heaven but you're still one of his and he will have that elect there's nothing going to stop that they're going god says jesus said you know you've given them to me and i'll not lose one it's his spirit that works in you he's bringing you to that perfection he's bringing you to the very image of himself but you have to let him he'll do it anyway but it's much easier if you let him right when it finally drops down into your heart that's when you recognize that you are a child of god and you you get that revelation you know once once you start you know into your process you know come into the holy ghost so i i just did this up and i just showed that in layer to see and there's many things going on in later to see it that could be uh drawing you or you have desires for and it's it could be in social media i mean you can get hooked on that stuff and you know uh personally you know i don't have much to do with it but you know especially in the new generation they do you know and there's all kinds of religious stuff you know that's going on and stuff on the internet and politics it could be drawn into that and fashion entertainment sports you know festivities like christmas or whatever and families drawn into that and et cetera et cetera there's a lot of distraction in laodicea and the same as in the other ages but then he's saying there's going to be a new creation right that he's going to have a bride and he said i call you no more church i'll call you abroad i'm going to take you out of leia to see you and i'm going to separate you unto me right that's what he's talking about so you know he's going to bring you over what are you going to bring over with you you want to bring in over any of that you know he doesn't want any of that he's building a new creation that's part of the laodicea all that stuff you know he wants to dead you that's in this in his bride right so this is he refers to as adam's creation this is the first creation and here is god's creation the one he started in 63. the man was of the old order or creation now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god the new creation is not the old creation made over it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is it's a new creation it's another creation distinct from the older one he is he is the first of the creation he is he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of this creation we are no longer a part of adam's creation adam's creation does not apply to us right all adam's creation goes down into a fire the people in the world are under adam's creation and they will suffer and die under adam's creation in the tribulation the bride is a is is in a different creation we're in heavenly places right heavenly places with christ jesus we are god men and god women living within our human vessel to bring us to the very image of himself and if you want to associate the world and do the things of the world then you will die in adam's creation romans 6 1 when what shall we say then shall we continue in sin the grace may abound i saw this in the commentary it says shall we continue under the old creation that grace may abound or shall we get into christ once you're into christ then you are part of grace right that's always interesting so i just had this this was an old uh diagram that i had to show what happens on the day of the rapture just before and just after but i just wanted to show that you know here what i really wanted to show that in the manifestation of the sons of god we're all waiting for the manifestations of the son of god and it's kind of it spans over two periods because there is there is some uh there is some of that right before the rapture but but and then there is and it it's talked about being right after the rapture also at the manifestation of sons of god but that goes on for a long time because you know it's like jesus when he finished on camera he said it's finished but it wasn't finished he had a lot of work to do right and then he comes through the bra the church age and now he's talking about another creation here and then he's talking about after the seven church ages and he has to deal with the the jews and the tribulation and all of that and bring judgment and then he has the judgment part we still go through the millennium the general resurrection gog and magog and the white throne judgment so all of that has to go on and then after that is the new heavens and the new earth and then there's in revelation 22. the wind up there and he has god has still got a lot of work in different forms because we know he's son of man so god son of david in these different periods you know he'll be son of david in the millennium right and also with the manifestations because we have a lot of work to do you know you think it's over all the rapture's on uh but we have a lot of work to do because we go right up to the judgment we're right up there to the judgment and brother i'm even alluded that we have to get ready for that you know over the time that's in between then and things so so the manifestation of sons of god goes on a lot but it keeps going on after that's that's the way i see it that's me saying that right so just just to give you an idea of the the way it is so this is from the latest in church age this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose getting down to the end this purpose took form through election this is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of god his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omni omnipotence he he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his brethren if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order for his purpose and good pleasure to be brought to pass and god you know you know jesus talked about you know the sparrows and the grass you know he you know he knows all about that and he doesn't know about his elect he knows everything about his elect right we know that it's not you and me it's him it's learning to rest in him and relax in him it's allowing him to do things he wants to do through us god predestinated to the adoption of children according to what he wants to do in his power he's bringing it to pass right amen second last slide so here in the token now remember hebrews 13 10 20 everlasting god's blood-bound promise makes us free from sin we're free from sin amen there is no sin in him sin self flesh worship him and show forth his promised power god's power blood bound token-bound covenant people has the spirit of jesus christ in here that he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also displaying the covenant see so we are free from sin we don't have to sin sin is unbelief and we don't have to disbelieve get into christ and you won't be disbelieving because his presence will be there and it will encourage you as the adopted sons and daughters of god and i say here read your bible and pray the god who is rich in mercy i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god you always were the sons of god because i showed in the elect you were there in the mind of god you were the signs of god but you we had spiritual amnesia jesus came and he knew as a child he knew who he was he knew he was the son of god right but we didn't until the holy ghost came out and found us you know so you weren't saved in that day when you're at the altar it's just a holy ghost revealing to you that you're a son of god he just went out to look for you and find you and give you that revelation you know that you're the son of god right and then you receive the holy ghost and you really realize oh i'm i didn't start here i started right back here i was in the mind of god and if i was a part of god who's eternal then i will be eternal always right and that's what you learned in this age is those things so i don't need to go to the altar every time the holy ghost found me you know now i'm in my flesh and i have trouble here there whatever but the more that i come closer to him the more i drop myself the more i die then then you don't sin you know it doesn't reach you you know you have it in control and then you go on as an adopted son of god god and then you get power right for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well then he before he even became material on the earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knew what your name would be he knew the color of your hair you would have he he knew all about you the only thing happened is when you being a sinner right so he knew you because how did you know barbara says you know uh you were you're the son of this person under discernment you know and he would he would bring back everything but didn't know it but god knew it who went back like four generations in his in a person's life or told them what they did yesterday or last year and nobody knew it and they knew so he knows those things right because he's he knows god knows you right and it's you know it's uh reassuring right it helps you builds your faith right so over here i just had you know um power and authority because we do have power it says we have power and authority we have authority over say we can we can rebuke satan you know because he's lost his power at calvary he had no more power he didn't have reign over anymore you know it's just now a bluff as they call a fake you know and so he doesn't really have the power you can say boo devil and he he can go you know if you're if you're talking in the name of the lord right and all your sins you know it's like they they're in the sea of forgetfulness there is no sin if you if you were it's like if you were someone who who went up before a a judge now on this earth in a course you know he would look back and say well you know you have no you have no uh a charge against you and you have no record there's no record up here there's nothing it's not like you you did it and they they they pardoned you you had nothing when god looks at you you've got no record he doesn't see anything he just sees oh that was that was a that just gets laid back on the devil's head all of that things that you did you don't have any he's just he's the blood he looks through and he sees the blood of jesus christ he still sees it you know so you're not you're you don't have that anymore you're not like a human an unbeliever who would have sinned and they would go in god's presence with sin they wouldn't happen and it means that you're a son and daughter of god because you had that so you know you're not in this this realm you're not a sinner saved by grace right you know you're a son of god right and brother branham started to realize that also i'm not i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god you are the sons of god right see you always were the sons of god nothing changed it's like said you went you went in under sin and you know under ephesians 2 and under the the spirit of disobedience you know and you were like those in the world but when you went to the altar when god drew you the holy spirit found you he draws you to the altar he he takes that away and you you you always were a son of god you didn't become a son of god when you receive salvation right he just found you you just gotta start believing it and acting like it right and and using that power and authority that you do have in you and if you listen to uh everlasting water from the rock that message he talks a lot about it for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there and no one talked like this you'd never see a theologian or anyone talking like this this is a prophet talking before the foundation in the mind of god way back there well when he before he even became material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he he knew what your name would be he knew the color of your hair you see that in the discernment line right we know that and you would have he knew all about you the only thing happened is is when you're being a sinner i think i just read that so here's here's the brother brian he says what was it there was another william branham a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of god the word of god that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things it was working so this is the last message he preached right and this is coming from the second last page in that message but yet all at once i looked up and i said i'm not a son of charles and ella branham his mother i'm not a son anymore i know now i'm not that's not my heritage there's something calling like my little eagle i'm not a chicken there's something up beyond there somewhere oh great jehovah whoever you are open up i want to come home there's something in me calling right i'm no longer a son of beatrice and francis coffey that's my mother-in-law if you didn't know when i was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now the old life was forgiven but in the sea of god forgetfulness to never be remembered against me no more now we stand justified as though we never had sinned in the presence of god amen the beginning see that's at the end let's begin amen anyway you've been very good and i finished in almost an hour so that's pretty good amen we can all stand and we can get the team up here again i appreciate y'all like going through the bible study and i hope it gives you a little bit of view of the blood and how important it is and and it's still important and always be important as long as we're in his flesh right but it'll go away it'll go away it wasn't there in the garden when it was adam and eve and they were in the right standing with god right it only came when god came down and saw they had sinned and he had set a sacrifice and it was the mercy of god to to them but now we're in a new creation we're no longer in adam's creation we're in god's creation new creation for this day we've already gone in there in heavenly places in christ jesus amen god bless you um do you got a song there yeah that's good i'll pass it over about there [Music] me i've been born again i thank god he justified me [Music] of his fullness [Music] i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man oh things have passed away i've been born again more than a conqueror that's

grace placed over the lentils of our heart and then god that's brother mark said god doesn't see the sin doesn't see the mistakes and he tells the devil he says to the devil i don't know what you're talking about when he tries to accuse you because all he's seeing is the son of god pure and the son of a daughter of god sanctified justified and filled with his spirit christ our redeemer died on the cross amen and i will dance [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] over here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] praise the lord [Applause] [Music]

change in me and we're going to close with this aspect of isil if you come and close in prayer and remember to continue to pray for the needs that were mentioned earlier especially remembering buddha gerald and brother jonathan and may god just touch them each one and all the sick from the youngest to the oldest may god just let faith rise in each and every one to claim that promise so let's pray for one another throughout the next while we're not sure about sunday yet so somebody will be in touch and uh we'll be on the road for a few days out of town so we just covered your prayers as well for that and uh so let god have his perfect way and perfect well in everyone's life like uh but mark referred to you know being separate from the world and as a believer it's not hard to become separate from this world to be honest when when that life starts to live itself out in all of us there's no way there's any desire for it so we want more and more of a desire for him so let's just uh pray one for another and draw closer to each other and closer to him over the next few days so god's grace to us all and let's just sing born again brother shall we close in prayer born again there's
