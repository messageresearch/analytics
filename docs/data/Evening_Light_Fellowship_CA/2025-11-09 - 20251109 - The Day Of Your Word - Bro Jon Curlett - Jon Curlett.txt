Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. It was a taste [music] of me [music] and war. hardly a place [music] for a king to be born.

Let it [music] &gt;&gt; live inside [music] this house of faith and hold it every day. [music] Let your word be born [singing] in the [music] manger of my [singing] heart. Lord Jesus, Lord, I want to thank you for your grace this morning. Lord, I want to thank you for this song service, Lord, for this people that's gathered. Lord, I want to thank you, Lord, that we've got something in our hearts to worship and praise you [music] about, Lord, that there's something on the inside, Lord, that wants to express, Lord, our thanksgiving [music] to you, Lord. Thank you for all that you are. Thank you for all that you've done. Thank you for your promises, Lord, that we can rest upon this morning, Lord. Thank you that we have a word that will change us, that'll draw us back to you, that'll restore us, that'll redeem us, heavenly father. Lord, we're in a special place this morning, Lord, that we can receive your word, Lord, and that it'll produce itself in our lives. [music] So, Lord, we're asking you once again, Lord, that the Holy Ghost would take the service, Lord, that you would minister to the [music] sheep of your flock, Lord. That your bride would leave these doors, this building this morning, Lord, changed a little bit more into your likeness, [music] heavenly father. Lord, help us to willingly lay down those things that hold us back. Lord, those things we're trying to control, those things we're trying to resolve. Lord, let us step freely, Lord, into the hands of your grace, your mercy, your your provision. Lord, let us recognize you are our all and all this morning. We pray, heavenly father. Lord, we're trusting you. [music] We commit all these things into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would to Psalms [snorts] chapter 105. Psalms 105 this morning. It's good to be back and then from my trip to Calgary. Certainly came back tired, but by God's grace, I've gotten on the time zone pretty quickly. I've had good sleep, so that's helping me recover quickly. And then appreciate Brother Mark and Brother Garfield taking the services. I got good reports from both of them. I was able to listen to Brother Mark's live even as I was flying on Sunday. Unfortunately, Brother Garfield started when I was at work and I didn't get home till almost 11:00 our time. So, I've only had a chance to listen to a bit of it. But I again, good reports and and people following up with me. So, God bless you both for doing that. Certainly appreciate it. Amen. I enjoyed the song service this morning is very good, Sister Nikki. That's a wonderful special. One of my favorite songs. Amen. To stand justified knowing you don't deserve it. Knowing what you've done and yet standing justified. Amen. What a wonderful thought. Amen. I certainly appreciate that. Uh just remember as brother Joe sent out a email this morning, we'll have communion on Sunday, November 23. That's two weeks out from now. Also remember we've got the Christmas program December 7th and each family has been asked to participate by song or by by playing something or reciting something, a spiritual dance perhaps, whatever the Lord lays on your heart. But remember that and you can talk to the different musicians. Uh preferably not all for Sister Priscil if you remember, but we've got Lydia here and Selena and Levi and brother Paul perhaps and these different ones. So spread it around if we could and that'll be a wonderful time. Amen. And then we've got Jamaica, uh the saints in Jamaica. We want to remember those. I've been in contact with some brothers about that over the last couple of weeks. And so we're going to take up an offering for them over the next week or two. I'll be working with brother Mark to to arrange and brother Garfield to arrange us to send some money over there to help. They are in desperate need for sure. And we're gathered here in this big beautiful building with a solid roof and heat and air conditioning and they're working in buildings that have had the roofs torn off and they've just got a tarp over them today while they have service and equipment that's been damaged or destroyed and these different things. Amen. We can we can certainly support them in some way. So, we'll pray that the Lord will put something on your heart to give to them and we'll we'll send out a formal announcement and then brother Mark and myself and brother Garfield will be managing that as well. Amen. Psalms chapter 105, [snorts] it says, "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord. Call upon his name. Make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him. Sing songs unto him. Talk ye of all his wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face ever more. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done. His wonders and the judgments of his mouth. Oh ye seed of Abraham his servant. Ye children of Jacob his chosen. He is the Lord our God. His judgments are in all the earth. He hath remembered his covenant forever. The word which he commanded to a thousand generations. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. And I'm excited to be back this morning. and excited to be back in the house of the Lord. It's It's funny how that works. Sometimes you just can't hardly wait for your break and then you get the break and you just can't hardly wait to get out of your break and back into the saddle. Amen. I believe that's the calling of God that does that is is is yours just there's always something that's pushing and and pulling sometimes to get you there. But I've had this service on my heart for quite some time. We're not starting a new series. This is a standalone service. And I want to take a title this morning of the day of your word. Amen. The day of your word. And we open with this beautiful Psalm of David where he's talking and he's saying, "Give thanks and glorify the Lord and seek his face and seek his strength and bless his name and and let your heart rejoice in the uh when you seek the Lord in these different things." And God has given us a portion, amen, that we're supposed to do. God's given us a work that's supposed to do and we're supposed to be seeking him. We're supposed to be worshiping him. We're supposed to be praising him. We're supposed to be glorifying him. Everything that our life is is supposed to reflect our Lord and our Savior. Amen. And we've got something to do. Amen. Is to magnify Jesus Christ through our words, through our life, through our deeds, through our families, through our work, whatever it may be. But I want to focus on that last bit that we finish with in verse number seven this morning as we continue through. And we'll be preaching out of this the entire morning. And he says, "He is the Lord our God." Amen. His judgments are in all the earth. He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. And we look at this and in verse nine it's going to say that covenant he made with Abraham. But church, you got to see this is with the family of God. This is with the faith seed of Abraham, the royal seed of Abraham. We are we are a part of this covenant, not by bloodline, but we are covenant by a faith seed, a faith gene inside of us that God placed there before the foundation of the world that we could hear the word. We could identify with the word. We could believe the word. We could receive the word. And we could have the word expressed inside of our lives. That's what we are this morning. Amen. We are Abraham's children by faith, not by bloodline. He says, "Which covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac, and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, saying, "Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance." church. That's quite something to promise to somebody who's old and has no children. I want you to think about the start of this covenant. This promise that he gave. Amen. That he was going to give them a land and it was just him and Sarah. Lord, we don't need a land. &gt;&gt; What we really need is a son. We could use a maybe a couple dozen children, Lord, but we have none. Doesn't matter. You're going to need a land. You're going to have so many. You're going to need a land. And I'm promising you the land. Lord, how you going to get us there? Don't worry about it. I've given you a land. You're going to have need of this land. He said, "When they were but a few men in number, yay, very few and strangers in it." God keeps repeating his promise to a people that have no apparent need for what he's promising yet. Can you consider that the land of Israel today, you can you can fly across it in a fighter jet in 45 seconds one way and a minute and a half or two minutes in the other. Tiny little piece of land, but it's for them. He says, "You're going to need a place to live, and I've given you a place." Why does he keep repeating it, church? Because his word never changes. His word never changes. He says, "When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people, he suffered. He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yay, he reproved kings for their sakes." Saying, "Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm." Remember Abraham goes into the land of Aimilec and he says to Sarah, "Say that you're my sister." Which was true because she was his halfsister. But what he was scared of was the king would see his old wife that had had a body change and would desire her for his wife. So he said, "Tell him you're my sister so that he doesn't kill me." And Aimilec sees her. And it's told him it's his sister. So he feels it's safe to take Sarah to be wife. And the Lord comes to him and he says, "You're a dead man." He says, "Lord, why? I'm a righteous man. You know me. I haven't done anything wrong." He says, "You're you've taken another man's wife to be your wife." He said, Lord, he told me he was his sister. He says, "It doesn't matter. Go and get him to pray for you, &gt;&gt; church. He suffered no man to do them wrong. He reproved kings for their sakes. Aimilec has done nothing wrong, but he has to go to a child of God and apologize for taking something without realizing what he was doing." And when Abraham prayed for him, God spared him and his family. That's the privilege of being a child of God, church. He'll keep you. &gt;&gt; He'll discipline you. He'll chastise you, but he will keep you. Nothing can touch you unless he allows it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, church, we look at this and if we were to take the the family of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob going down, I would say under this condition, they were in a revival. They're going from place to place. Wherever they go, they have children upon children. Their flocks and their herds are growing. Nobody can stand against them. Nobody can touch them. Nothing can conquer them. They're in a perfect place. Everything their hand touches is blessed. Amen. But I want you to see how God works because God in all of this is setting the stage to fulfill his covenant. Okay? Now, I want to take us back to that original covenant just so we can so see the good the the the full picture because so often what we do when God promises something us is we focus on the promise and we forget the conditions around the promise. We forget the circumstances around what he's promising us to do. Amen. So many times when we look at what God's promising, it's surrounded by hardship. It's surrounded by persecution. It's surrounded by sickness. It's surrounded by darkness. It's surrounded by despair. It's surrounded by bondage. It's surrounded by things that are trying to get our eyes off of the word of God. But that's what makes God God is out of all of that, he can produce something good. Out of all of that, he can produce his word. Out of all of that, he can fulfill his promise when it looks like he can't do anything. Look at what he said to Abraham. He said unto him, I am the Lord thy God. I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Caldes to give thee this land to inherit it. Verse 13. And he said unto Abraham, know of assurityity. In other words, have no doubt about what I'm about to say, that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years. and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance. Church, we can look at the promises of God and we love them and we believe them and we want to receive them. But look at the background of this great promise of God. The covenant to Israel is surrounded by hardship. It's surrounded by bondage. It's surrounded by slavery. Can you imagine a good God saying to you that you are going to be born into slavery and you will die into slavery as children of the promise? Church, we would doubt if we're children of God. We're doubt if we're children of his love. We're doubt that that we are the children of his good nature because it seems like everything that he's put on them, you're born into and you die in slavery. There were generations after generations of Israelites born in Egypt that died in slavery having never received the promise of God. Church, let me put it this way. Some of us have to be sick so that we can see that he's a healer. Some of us have to be lost so that we can be found. Some of us have to have our hearts broken so that he can bind them up again. Some of us have to fail so that he can restore. Some of us have to walk away so that he can pull us back. Some of us, our promises are surrounded by hardship, by failures, by despair. But that doesn't mean God's not in it. Amen. It doesn't mean that God's not in of it. Some of us have to fall so he can say, "I'll lift you up." Every word has to be fulfilled. Amen. Church, we've got to stop looking at the circumstances of our life and see the big picture. See what God's trying to do. See God's purpose in all of it. Because we'll see as we go through this that God has a plan. God has a purpose in everything that we go through. In everything that we go through. Amen. And God has a people that will walk through these things in victory because they will not let the circumstances change who they are. They will not be allowed to change what they believe. They will not be allowed to change what they say. Why? Because there's something inside of them that is producing the word of promise. &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to do. He's got a people that'll stand no matter what. And I believe this morning, it's you. &gt;&gt; It's me. Amen. It's not somebody out there. It's not for some great ministry or some great church. But it's simple people that'll take the word of God. They'll keep it in their mind. They'll keep it on their lips and they'll say, "Here I stand. &gt;&gt; I won't move. &gt;&gt; I won't move." But I want you to see what God says in this Psalms 105 here because he's talking about this beautiful promise of the people of Israel. But watch what he does now in verse 16. It says, "Moreover, he called for a famine upon the land. He broke the whole staff of bread." God took the children of Israel and he put them in a time of hardship. He took everything that he had blessed them with and he started to pull back. It says he broke the staff of bread. Bread was considered the lifeline. If you had bread and water, you could survive forever. And God started pulling it back. God did this church to where they could not provide for themselves. And catch this. He sent a man before them, even Joseph who was sold for a servant. Let me stop here. Look at what he says. He sent church. Do you realize what that means? When you go into hard circumstances, you're one cent. David can say this because David's got 2020 hindsight. David has seen the whole thing play out. And so David can look back and say, "He sent." He didn't say, "It happened this way or bad luck struck Joseph." He said, "He sent." God sent. Amen. Before them, even Joseph, Amen, church. But look at this. Through the the this life of Joseph through his eyes, the circumstances he went through, the hardship, the disappointment, the pain, the suffering, the offenses. And Joseph never did anything to deserve what happened to him. [snorts] Are you listening this morning? Joseph didn't backslide. Joseph didn't fornicate. Joseph didn't try and take matters into his own hands. He didn't disobey. in blaspheme. Joseph lived a perfect life. And here's the result. Whose feet they hurt with feathers and he was laid in iron. Joseph was perfect in his actions, perfect in his life. And yet the scripture says that God allowed him, God sent him into slavery. God sent his feet to be put into fedters. God sent him to be falsely accu accused. God sent him to be put in prison. God sent him to a place that seemed hopeless. And that was the tender hand of Jehovah for Joseph and his family. &gt;&gt; But watch this verse. And this is the genesis of this service this morning. Until the time that his word came, the word of the Lord tried him. Remember, Joseph had a word from God. Joseph at the age of 17, he has a dream from God where he is standing up and his brothers and his parents all bowed down before him. He has a prophetic decree over his life that he will rule and reign over his family. Amen. Even before his parents died, the Bible tells us that Joseph was 17 years old when he was sold into slavery. In other words, he was the age of my son Jonathan, if you want to put it into context this morning. and his brothers loved him so much that they sold him for 20 shekels of silver. I looked it up. They say that's that the value of the silver would be about 200 bucks today. So then they tore up his coat, [snorts] covered it in blood, and they brought it back to his father and they said, "We found this. We don't know if it's Joseph's coat or not." And they let him draw his own conclusion that Joseph had been killed by a wild animal. Church, but I want you to take yourself and put yourself in Joseph's place tonight. Maybe you feel like you're in Joseph's place. Amen. Joseph has his devotions every morning. He prays with and communes with the one true God. He sacrifices the way that he's supposed to. He lives a clean life. He's a prophet of God. He's ordained to a special gift in his life. Even at the early age of 17, he's a godly teenager, blameless in his life. At the age of 17, he has this dream of everyone bowing down before him. And that's quite a prophecy to have in your life at the age of 17. Can you imagine if Jonathan had a dream like that? That he was perhaps going to be prime minister of all Canada. And knowing that it was going to happen, he would be saying every day, "Lord, how blessed am I." Maybe not so much these days because it's such a mess. But can you imagine a young man in our church having a prophecy over him that everyone will bow down before you? You'll have power and authority over everyone that's around you. We would think, "Boy, God sure loves me. God sure thinks something of me." The scripture says that that that day when that would happen is the day of his word, the time of his word. But until the day of the promise being fulfilled would come, what has to happen? The word of the Lord tried him. The word of the Lord tried him. Amen. It says until the time that his word came. And then it puts the coal in there. And you got to watch in scripture because God does everything perfectly. There's a time allocated for the day of your word. The time of your word. But between that and everything else, there's a gap. And what is it? It's the time of the Lord. The word of the Lord that tries you. Amen. [snorts] If I could put it this way, the word of the Lord tried Joseph a long time so that the word of Joseph could happen. Amen. Listen to how the prophet of God says this now. He says, "Joseph was an elected son. He was a perfect type of Jesus Christ. He was born a prophet and he could see visions. And when he was yet a little boy, he saw a vision of himself sitting on a throne and his brothers bowing to him. He says, "And watch." He felt like he was a great guy. Church, nothing wrong with thinking you're a great guy. And by church, we ought to be able to say, "The Lord is pleased with my life." We ought to be able to do that. Amen. But remember, where you are today is not where you want to be tomorrow. God's always trying to grow us. God's always trying to take us to a higher level. God has a plan for your life. God has a word for your life and his goal is to get you there. Just because you're good today doesn't mean you're good for tomorrow. The trials of tomorrow, the tests of tomorrow are going to be higher than today. So, we got to keep growing. Amen. Imagine if you will, Joseph daily and he's worshiping and he's praising and he's having his devotions and he's living a life worthy of a gospel and then one day his father sends him out to check on his brothers because they're feeding their sheep out near another place. And in a moment, his life changes. One minute he's walking and talking, comes up to his brethren. They take him, throw him in a pit, and throw up rip his jacket off of him. It's a dry well. And they throw him in there. And a few hours later, not only that, they've taken him and they sold him to distant relatives. And now he's on a on a on a slave train all the way to where he knows what. And so day after day, he's trudging through rock and sand and blistering heat, no hope, tied behind a camel, not knowing where he's going to go. Church, this is what God sent looks like. Sometimes God sends him away from his cozy fellowship, his family, his his structured life, his blessed condition, and he sends him to a foreign land, not as a free man, but now as a slave. Amen. How do you think Joseph was praying all the way to Egypt? Joseph no doubt was saying,"Lord, what is going on? I've served you faithfully. I've lived a blameless life. I've done everything I know to do to please you, and now I'm on the road to who knows where, and I'm a slave. My own distant relatives, the Israelites, remember, are are part of his family. They bound me up." Lord, deliver your servant. Deliver your son. Supernaturally break my bonds, Lord. Lord, help me. Deliver me. Lord, I've got a word that I'm supposed to fulfill. Lord, you promised me that I was going to have power and authority. Break this out of my life. Isn't that what we'd be praying? Isn't that what we pray? Of course it is. And there's nothing wrong with praying it. You ought to pray it. We've got a God that's a deliverer. We've got a do God that's a provider, a healer, and all these different things. We ought to believe and pray, but you have to understand there's two words working. And God's got to get you where you need to be before you can receive what he has for you. Joseph's bought and he's taken to Egypt and he's bought and he's placed in the house of Potterer. He's a captain of the guard of Pharaoh. And the scripture says that the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man. Even in his slavery, Joseph was blessed. a church. Can you imagine the paradox? I'm a blessed slave. Anybody here want to be a blessed slave? I'm not interested in being a blessed slave. Yet, aren't we all blessed slaves? Cuz we're all living in a slave to this flesh condition, bound to what? We're born in sin, shaped in iniquity, and only the soul has been redeemed. But everything else is fighting against us and trying to bind us. But in that condition, yet the Lord can bless us. Let the Lord can use us. Yet the Lord can show that he is with us day by day. And the scripture says that Joseph found grace in the eyes of Piper. And Piper put Joseph over control of all his physical goods, all of his possessions. And the God and the scripture says that God blessed Piper for Joseph's sake. Church, now that's a good that's a better life, but it's not a good life. A blessed slave is still a slave. He was not in his original condition. He's still living below his privileges. Amen. But as the the chief slave, as the the head of Potterer's household, no doubt he had freedom to walk around. And no doubt Piper allowed him to wear nicer clothes and bathe regularly because he would represent Piper. So he had the best that you life that you could live as a slave. But he was still a slave. No fellowship, no family. Had to learn a new language. Everything was strange to him. Everything was hard to him. Not great, but certainly not bad. Amen. And then one day, Piper's wife tries to seduce Joseph, and she tries to get him to sleep with her, and Joseph refuses her point blank. And I've said this before, but I like to say I like Joseph's response. He used his feet for discernment. Amen. He didn't stand around to argue with her, to tell her about how big of a a believer he was and that God wouldn't be pleased with it. He said, "I can't do it. Your master has put me over his house, but not over you. I'm out of here." And he ran away from her. Brothers, sisters, if you're in a time of temptation, don't stick around. Leave immediately. The scripture says he fled and got him out. That's what you need to do. Get out. Lay it down. Walk away. Use your feet for discernment. Turn it off. Whatever it might be. Amen. [snorts] Get out of the situation early. Otherwise, Satan's offer gets more and more tempting the longer you stay there. Joseph walks away, runs away. Thank you, Lord, for delivering me. And what does God do? God allows him to be falsely accused and convicted of raping Piper's wife and sends him to prison. And Joseph said, "Thank you, Jesus." Did he? Can you imagine? The social justice warriors would no doubt be out. Can you imagine the prayers that Joseph was saying, but God allowed it? God sent him to prison. Church, this is not happen stance. It's not bad luck. This is the perfect will of God for Joseph's life. He says, "What did God have to do?" He did the same thing he did to the rest of them. Because Moses was a deliverer, Paul was a deliverer. how Joseph was a deliverer. He saved his people from the famine. What did God have to do to him? He says, "Put him in prison." He put him right straight in the prison. Remember, he was sold by his brethren to an Egyptian. They sold him to Piper. And Piper gave him a little bit of liberty. And the first thing you know, that was taken from him. There he sat in the prison crying, crying and crying. He says God had to strip it. Church, what would we be praying now if we were in Joseph's life and in his shoes, in his condition? Amen. We'd be crying out, "God, listen. I don't understand this. You made me a slave, but in my slavery, I've been faithful. I haven't abused my privileges. I didn't take advantage of everything. I didn't try and escape. I didn't do anything to to to shame you, Lord. I've lived my life as clean as I can. I've done everything I can to to to make my master succeed. And out of this, I'm in prison. done nothing to deserve jail, done nothing to deserve to live with criminals. Church, wouldn't we be crying out for justice, deliverance, salvation, supernatural intervention? Absolutely, church. Those are our promises. But remember, there's a word of the Lord that overshadows the word for you and I. There's a bigger picture that's happening. Amen. And I believe one thing, church. Joseph's a prophet. And I'd like to say Joseph had a different attitude. And I believe the scripture bears that out because he believes the word of God. And that's what keeps him on the straight and narrow. That's what keeps him going day by day. He says, "Now notice, but all the time I believe in that prison, he could remember that the vision said he was going to sit on a throne and his brothers were going to bow to him because he knew that his gift came from God." Notice he could. You choose what you're going to dwell on, church. You choose what you're going to dwell on. He could dwell on the prison cell or he could dwell on the word of God. The choice is his choice is yours. He says if we could only keep that in our mind and according to the word of God that in these last days he's going to have a church. He's going to have a people. And these things that he promised, he's going to do them. He said he said that he would. And we're living in the time we're there. He's just trying to get us to be real prisoners now. Locked in with him. He says, "You've heard that old song you sing, shut in with God. I want to be shut in with God." Being shut in with God, nothing else. And you only move when God says move. You only do as God says do. See, then you're shut in with God. See, so often we're saying, "God, get me out." And God say, "No, get in. Get in with me. Get shut in with me. Get tied in with me. And then you can go free." Cuz if I set you free now, you won't do what you're supposed to do. But get closer to me. Get closer to me. Stay with me a little while. He says, "Now you remember he was thinking he also became a total failure to himself. All that he knew, all that he understood and everything, he became a total failure." See, you got to understand this. We can have the promise in the word of God, but God is the one that will declare it. God is the one that determines how it comes to pass. The prophet of God taught us God interprets his word how? By bringing it to pass. Joseph knew he had a word promise. Joseph understood differently than God. Joseph no doubt assumed he was just going to because he was a good guy get elevated up. His brothers were scoundrels. We know his brothers were no goods, weren't they? Go look at what some of his brothers did. Some of them had their names removed from the book. They had no land. God took it away, gave it to Ephraim and Manasseh. Joseph's brothers were scoundrels. Joseph by his good nature and good living was more worthy to receive authority than they were. And no doubt he was banking on that. All that he knew, all that he understood. But he became a total failure. It didn't work. He was put in a situation to where nobody would listen to him. He was a prisoner. See, he was put into a situation that unbelievers would not believe. Do you see what I mean? His ministry was of no effect. The people turned their head. They wouldn't pay attention to him in prison. What good would his ministry do? He might stand to the prison bars and preach to them. They'd walk on down the street. See, but he became a prisoner. And God kept him a prisoner until the wheel rolled up, right? He said, "Here is my man." He says, "Glory, total failure." Total failure, church. Are you feeling bound today? Are you feeling like you're working and you're working and nothing's happening? That you're doing everything you can do and yet the results aren't there? That you have prayed, you have believed, you have acted, you have moved, you have stood still, whatever you feel that you're supposed to do, and yet nothing has changed. Welcome to Joseph's life. Welcome to Joseph's life. Amen. The prophet of God says in that condition, he says, "Glory, total failure." Why? Because the word of the Lord is trying him. That's what's going on. Amen. That word try, it says the word of the Lord tried him. It means it refined, it purged, it purified, it tested. So in other words, the word of the Lord was working on Joseph to get him to the point where he was suitable to receive the day of his visitation, the time of his word. Amen. God put Joseph through 13 years of hell. Church, Joseph didn't have ups and downs. Joseph had downs and downs. It just kept getting worse. as an ordained son of God, as God's prophet, as God's redeemer for that time, if I could put it that way. Joseph's life kept going down, down, down. What a life. What a life. Kept getting worse. Even with the blessings of God, he still stayed a slave and then dropped down into a prisoner. Amen. He kept going further and further into hardship, into rejection, into despair. Perhaps we'd say today, things just kept spiraling downwards. Talk about forsaken, church. If he wanted to feel forsaken, he had every right to do it. The situation certainly supported it. He could have claimed he was forsaken. He could have blamed God. He could have turned away and done those things. But he elected not to do those things. He chose his thoughts. He chose his attitude. He chose his response. And we have the same thing today when it comes down to the hard times is Lord, I'm going to think about what you said and I'm going to trust your process. Joseph didn't think about his circumstances. He just kept on believing. Amen. The scripture says that even in prison, the Lord showed him mercy and gave him favor with the keeper of the prisons, with the prison warden. And so, Joseph still had a measure of authority and freedom. And God blessed whatever Joseph did. And you'll notice in Joseph's life that no matter where he went, he always had power and authority. Did you notice that? As a slave, he got power and authority. As a prisoner, he got power and authority. Amen. It was in measure, but it was always there. He had access to money. He had opportunity to use it, you know, to his benefit. In Piper's house, he managed all the finances of his house. In theory, Joseph could have siphoned off some money to buy his freedom, to buy away out of Egypt, but he never did. He always held his character. He always did it to the best of his ability with honor. Amen. And he did everything for the benefit of his master. He didn't use it for his own advantage. And then in prison, the Bible says he ran the entire prison while he was there. The keeper of the prison, the warden, gave everything into Joseph's hands. And Joseph ran the whole prison. That guy had the easiest job in the world for a couple of years because Joseph ran everything. and he just sat back and everything Joseph did, God blessed it. In prison, can you imagine church? Prisons in those days are not like today. Today, they have three square meals, they have a uh uh, you know, air conditioning, they have heating, they have proper clothes, they get to bathe every day, they have a TV there, they have exercise equipment, they have all these things. Back then, they didn't have it. It was stinking dark holes with sloppy food if you got any. Not a fun time. But even in prison, Joseph remains faithful and he's responsive to God when God moves. And remember what happened is the chief butler and the chief baker from Pharaoh's court came to him. They said, "Hey, we've got these dreams." And Joseph goes and God gives him his answers for them. And he goes, [laughter] excuse me, [snorts] and he tells the the chief baker, he says, "Listen," or he tells the chief butler, he says, "Your dream is in three days you're going to go back and Pharaoh's going to restore you back to favor." Then the chief baker tells him his story. And he says, "You're going to lose your head. You're going to go in three days and say, and Pharaoh's going to chop your head off, and you're going to die." And he says to the chief butler, he says, "When you go to Pharaoh, remember me. remember me, Lord. When he goes, let him remember me. And what does he do, church? For two years, he forgets. And yet, Joseph is never resentful. Joseph never turns his back on God. Joseph never curses the day he was born. Joseph stays faithful. Church, you say, "I've done everything I can do. What more can I do?" Stay faithful. Just keep walking. Just keep pressing forward in it. Amen. Joseph has this great promise in his life and yet his circumstances are so contrary to everything he ever thought that would help bring it about. Amen. Brother Bram says it this way. The church needs tonight not a soft hybrid something soft and flabby like the church is just make a confession, be baptized and you're a Christian. He says to be a Christian is selfdenial. Deny yourself, take up your cross, follow me daily. See, we think that it's so easy sometimes. I've committed myself to him. Therefore, he's going to take care of me. He is. But he said, you got to take up your cross daily. Daily. There's a burden to bear. There's a hardship to bear every day. I don't care who's in this room. Can't we testify to it? There's a cross to bear daily. Amen. Me and Sister Brenda, thank you, Sister Brenda, for that. Every day there's a cross to bear. He says, "Today it's so soft and people call themselves Christians when it used to mean death to confess Christ and you had to depend on him daily for everything you had need of." My wife was talking to me about the service that Brother Garfield preached on Wednesday night and how much she appreciated what he said about seeking eternal seeking spiritual experiences rather than earthly experiences. Because what's going to get us out of here is not God providing for our our our house payments and our car payments and our utilities and our food. And that's all good and he's promised to take care of it. But it's a kingdom experience we're looking for. Amen. It's a heavenly experience. It's a supernatural experience that we're looking for. And if we can look to him for that, he'll take care of everything else. But so often what we're doing is we're taking care of everything else. And then we look to him for something and what's left almost nothing because we burnt ourselves out trying to take care of ourselves. But church, what I love about this scripture says until the time of his word came. But one day, hallelujah, the time of his word came. The time of his word came and Joseph stepped into a new reality. Amen. There came a day where the trying and the praying and the waiting and the trusting finally came into fruition. Amen. I'm here to tell you today, church, there's a time for your word to be fulfilled. There's a time ordained for your word to be fulfilled. There's coming a day where God's going to say, "He's finished. She's done. He's ready. She's good to go. Let's get out of here." And there'll be a time of your word. Amen. It's time to take her out of her downs and outs. And it's time to take her up into the supernatural. It's time to lift him up beyond what he's been seeing, beyond what he's been thinking. And look what it says. David says, "The king sent and loosed him, even the ruler of the people, and let him go free and made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators wisdom." I want to step into Joseph's shoes one more time. Now, remember, he's a child of God. He's the elect seed. He's an ordained prophet. He's chosen of God. He's sent of God, and he's living in prison. But one day he gets a summons. One day a royal envoy comes and he says to Joseph, "The king requires your presence." And Joseph walks out of that prison, not knowing that's the last time he'll ever step in that prison again. &gt;&gt; Church, you don't know the day. You don't know the hour. But when it happens, you'll know what's going on. When it comes forth in your life, you'll say, "It's here. The time is here." Church, the scripture says, "No man knows the day for the hour, but we'll hear the call. We don't know when it will happen, but we'll feel the pull and something will say, "This is it. This is it." Amen. Joseph did not know that that was the last day he would ever spend in prison when he walked out. [snorts] Church, one day we're going to take our last steps in this prison, and we'll be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, and our temporary healing will be a permanent healing. Our temporary uh uh deliverance will be a permanent deliverance. Our temporary fellowship will become a permanent fellowship. The imperfect will translate into the perfect. One last movement and then it'll just be divi divine love. Divine love. Perfect love. The prophet of God said. Amen. He says finally God came to him in his prison and he used the gift that he had given him to get him out of there. That's right. He brought him from his prison. What did he do? He said as soon as he brought him from his prison, he was given power by the king, his king that he sat on the side of that he was under. He was brought from the prison house and given power whatever he said had to happen. He says in his prison, now here's the key. In his prison, he constantly remembered he was born for a purpose. He was going to sit by a king. All the rest of them were going to bow a knee to him. His vision told him so. But before his vision should could be completely fulfilled, he had to become a prisoner. And then he became a ruler. And when he came from his prison house and became a prisoner of the word of God, that he could only say what God put his mouth to say, then God moved through him. Church, there's two words at work and it's one in the same word. There's the word of the Lord and it has a great purpose and it's to bring you to the time of your word. Amen. The word of the Lord is preparing you, purging you, trying you, purifying you, so that when the day of your word comes, you'll be ready for it. You'll be ready for it. Listen to what Paul would say. He says, "Seeing wherefore, seeing that also we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us set aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run how with patience, the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds." Paul's saying here, listen, look at how Jesus lived and acted and reacted relative to his circumstances and then consider your lives and live the way that he lived. Copy him and get his results. I love this church because our God came down. He [snorts] did not stay in the portals of glory in his majesty and say, "All these people, why do they struggle so? Why do they fall so often? Why do they fail so often? Why is their faith so weak?" No, he came down himself into flesh so that he could experience everything that you and I experience. So that he could have an understanding of what we go through. And Christ, he came down in the form of Jesus Christ and he experienced and he overcame everything that you and I face. Amen. We're going to dwell on this a little more when we start this other series, Lord willing, next Sunday. But I want to say it this way, church. He knows and he understands where you are today. He understands what you're going through. He knew what it was to suffer hardship as a believer, to suffer rejection, to be misunderstood, to be falsely accused, to be burdened down with a daily weight, to be bombarded with things, to know pain and rejection. He knew temptation. Young people, he knew temptation. He knew what it was like to believe the best in people and be disappointed time and time again. But through it all, church, he overcame. And we overcome the same way he overcame by the spirit of the living God inside of us, keeping us tight to his word. That's how we do it. Amen. [snorts] The scripture says here that Jesus is the author and the finisher of our faith. That word author means this. See, we look at it as the writer, but what it means is the pioneer, the founder, the captain, the one who leads the way by example. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, in other words, he doesn't just tell us what to do, he shows us what to do. He showed us what to do. Amen. Church, you know, the greatest way to teach your children is not to say it, it's to do it. Because children copy what you do, not what you say. And so, Christ was no different. He came and he showed us how to overcome. He showed us how to endure. He showed us how to come to the time of our word with patience, despising the hardship, meaning making it of no consideration because there's a joy that's waiting and that's what he valued most. It says he's the finisher. That word means the perfector, the one that completes the process to produce the expected results. Can you say praise the Lord this morning? He shows us what to do and then he puts us through the process to bring us to an expected end. He's got it all in control. He's got it all in his hands, church. Amen. He He's the one that's guiding and controlling all situations to bring us into his perfection, into his acceptance, into his very presence as sons and daughters of God, justified, accepted before him. That's what he's trying to do. Why are we worried? Why are we doubting? Why are we concerned? [snorts] We struggle so many times, church, when things get out of control. When things seem out of control, when we've done all we can and it's still going to hell in a hand basket. That's when we pull back. We're like, "Whoa, where's God? What did I do to deserve this? I prayed. I've got faith." That has nothing to do with it. God's got a plan. God has a word of the Lord to bring you to the time of your word. Amen. We can do everything right, church, that doesn't stop hard times. We can live by faith. That doesn't stop sickness. We can raise our kids to the best of our abilities, and that doesn't mean they're all going to come the way we want them to come. We can work hard every day and still get laid off. We can do everything right and that doesn't mean we walk or live in a bed of ease. Why? Because there's a word of the Lord that's preparing us. There's a word of the Lord that's preparing us. Church, we've got to be able to praise God no matter what. When you come to church on Sunday morning, I don't care how your week is, if you'll lift up your hands and you'll worship him. See, praise is about what he's done. Worship is about who he is. And the thing is, if you can worship him when you have nothing to praise about, it seems it'll change the atmosphere around you. It'll change your mind. It'll change the the very nature of your being. When you can say, "You're God. I love you. I trust you. I believe you. I'm sticking with you. Give me strength to keep on going." Amen. [snorts] I want you to see the end result of Joseph's life because so often what happens is we miss what God's doing because we're so busy trying to define what he's supposed to do in our lives. Remember Joseph's brothers come to him multiple times and he tricks them and hides their money back in their bags and then he hides his cup and accuses them of stealing them. And it's all Joseph manipulating the situation to spend time with them, trying to get him to come over. And so finally, Joseph's there and he's going to reveal himself. And he says, "And Joseph said unto his brethren, come near to me, I pray you." And they came near. And he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt." Now, I want you to catch verse 5. Now, therefore, be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither. Church, Joseph is comforting his brothers. They're the ones that threw him in a pit, sold him into slavery, deceived his father, gave him 13 years of hell. And Joseph's saying, "Don't worry about it. Don't be mad. Don't be grieved about it." He's comforting those that persecuted him. And what does he say? For God did send me before you to do what? Preserve life. He says, "For these two years had the famine been in the land, and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earring nor harvest. And God sent me." Hallelujah. God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity and the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. Look at Joseph's revelation. His prophetic vision was not about him. His prophetic vision was about them. It was about preservation of life. It was about service. It was about doing the right thing for his family, about preserving them so God could give them a land 400 years later. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? He's comforting and forgiving those that put him in this position, the hardships they put him through, because he says God was in it. God was in it. God's purpose was to preserve life. It was not to elevate Joseph. That was just a necessity to produce life and preserve life. So what is it church? Joseph now has character to match his revelation. See so often we think we've got the revelation but we don't have the character to produce what we believe in. And Joseph perhaps if he'd have been given this at 17 or 18 or 19 early years into his hardship, you know what he'd have done? Put him into prison. Let them go through what I went through. I don't know. I don't know what he would have done in his youth. But all I know is the word of the Lord produced the day where the word of Joseph produced the right thing. That when he's put into position, he says the right thing, he does the right thing, he has the right attitude, he produces Christ. Amen. Are you hearing me this morning? What is he trying to do? Produce himself in you. That's all that matters. because he's coming back for a bride without spot or wrinkle. He's coming back for bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. Verse eight, he says, "So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God." Look at your own life. I think of brother Garfield sitting here, Brother Philly back there. God has pulled you away from a great ministry, a great church family, from family, from believers, from culture. Not easy, is it? Not easy, is it, Sister Brenda, Sister Moren, God has pulled you away from your family. But let me tell you this. He hasn't pulled you. He sent you to preserve life. You have no idea. You have no idea, Sister Brenda. On the day of judgment, what you could stand for. and all that you have endured, all that you have faced, &gt;&gt; everything you've dealt with was for one purpose, to preserve life. &gt;&gt; Because the bride is about mercy, not about judgment. But she's got to come to a place of character where she says, "Not only do I forgive it you forgive you, let me comfort you. He's been my comfort. Let me be yours. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I've had hard things done to me in my life, unfair things said and done. But you know what? God's been in it. And with that per if we could only look forward with the same faith we have looking backward to realize he's got it all in control. Even my mistakes and failures, he's got it all in control. Amen. [snorts] So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God. And he hath made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. Joseph now has this great revelation of what this was all about. Provision, preservation of life, redemption, forgiveness. And Joseph's own testimony is it was God all along. You had nothing to do with it. Yes, God used you. God used your jealous nature. God used your broken nature, but he used it. He used it, not you. It wasn't you. It was God that's doing it. And he's not bitter about it. Catch that. Joseph is not bitter about 13 years of slavery. He's not resentful. He's not harsh. He's not like, "Guys, there is going to be a price to pay." On that day, brothers, no. Comforts them. God was in it. Church, do you see the kind of character he's looking for? God help us. God help us. Amen. Joseph was grateful that God deemed him worthy to go through this process to come out the other side to perfect his plan for his people. Grateful. Grateful for 13 years of slavery and prison. And he forgave his brothers because he saw the hand of God in it. [snorts] You listen to brother Ron Spencer talk about his life in these past almost six years or so. And if you remember some of what he's told, and these are public statements. I'm not sharing anything that he he shared privately privately with me or anything. [snorts] But remember what he said. He said him and his brother his son Andrew were praying in the room and and the presence of God came in and he said, "If you'll trust me, I'll use you like never before." Now, where would our mind go if God came to us and said something like that? some great new ministry, some great new gift, some great new sign, something to elevate me. That's where our minds would go. And he wondered about it. What is this going to look like? And a few months later, what does God do? Gives him stage four brain and lung cancer. God sent him. God sent him. And what has it been ever since, church? It has been a man preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ with stage four cancer. 30 pills every morning. Treatment after treatment, surgery after surgery. But through it all, he has inspired faith. Through his ministry, others have been healed. He has obtained partial healing. supernaturally. Remember, his eye was preserved. God has preserved him, but God has not taken away the circumstances. Remember what I said, the privilege of God is to keep you, not keep you back from anything that would harm, anything that would hurt, anything that would damage. No, no, no. The hardship has got to come. And he has a greater testimony today than he's ever had. Because through it all, what has he been? Faithful. Faithful. Faithful. Faithful. See the difference between our interpretation and God's? Because our interpretation is me and God's interpretation is the body of Christ. We're here to serve. Ministers. We're here to serve. Elders in the church. We're here to serve. Officers of the church. We're here to serve. Mothers and fathers, we're here to serve. It's not about me. It's about him. It's about the body of Christ. [snorts] Amen. In sickness and in weakness. Brother Ron has preached this gospel to great effect. But remember, God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. Nobody here is volunteering for that. Job would say it this way. But he knoweth the way I take. And when he had tried me, I shall come forth as gold. Let's bring it down to our lives if we can as we start to close this morning. Peter would say this. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, a living hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. In other words, it's something eternal that awaits us, not something natural. Amen. Don't look to temporary things. Like brother Garfield was talking about, look to the eternal. Look to the spiritual events, not to the natural. Amen. These things we have. Listen, we have a natural inheritance here. God's provision is for us. That's our inheritance here. His healing is for us, his deliverance, his leadership, all these different things. Those are why we're here. But that is not our inheritance. This is all going to go. But there's something eternal waiting for us in the heavens that will never fade away. Listen to this. Verse 5, who are kept how? By my great Germanic discipline, by tradition, by force of nature, because my parents make me. Because if I don't, then somebody will think I'm not a believer. No. Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. Church, what we've experienced here, as great as it is, is not the whole deal. We haven't experienced the fullness of salvation. There's a greater salvation that's coming. There's a greater joy. There's a greater healing. There's a greater love. There's a greater rest. And what is it? It's an eternal love. It's an eternal joy. It's an eternal rest. Everything here is temporary. But there is a greater salvation that's coming for us. Amen. And it's ready to be revealed when? Now. &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. That's the time of our word is that greater salvation being revealed. Amen. There's a greater sanctification coming. He says, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice?" Rejoicing in what? This great salvation that's coming, the power of God through faith in our lives, wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be. Who determines the need, church? This guy? No, because I will never do something that I don't want to do by choice. I'm not going to do it. So, the need is determined by him. I can know the need and refuse the remedy. But a child of God, God says, "No, we're going to get this fixed. We're going to get this taken care of. We're going to resolve it. We're going to finish it." He says, "If need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations. You're carrying a great burden through many trials is what he's saying there, church. What's our attitude? Here's our This is our life. This is our time. This is our day. This greater salvation ready to be revealed. The power of God through faith working in our lives. He says, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice." We ought to be rejoicing in the word that's for us, even when the word of the Lord tries us. That's what we're supposed to be doing. That's the challenge this morning. Even when we are in when he says we need heaviness, we need burdens, we need hardship, we need persecution, we need rejection, we need misunderstanding, we need sickness, we need can we still say, praise the Lord. Lord, I love you. Lord, I trust you. Lord, I believe in you. Lord, I'm going to stay faithful no matter what happens. He says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire. The only way to purify gold is with heat. And what does it do? It makes all the impurities rise to the surface so that they can scoop it off. None of us wants to see our impurities come to the surface, do we? Nobody. I don't want anybody to see those things that I try and keep hidden. But guess what? In the fire, all the impurities come out. And we say, "Where did that come from?" Lord, take that away that you could be reflected in my life. Cuz that's me. That's not you. That's what Joseph went through 13 years of hardship for. To get Joseph out of the equation so Christ could come through. [snorts] What does the trial of our faith produce? Gold. Tried in the fire. What does gold always represent? character. And it's the character of Christ. Amen. Character to match the position. Character to match the revelation. Character to match the gift. Character to match the calling. Character to match the power and authority that he's given you. What does it take? The working of the word of the Lord. That's what he's doing. The trying of the word of the Lord. Paul would say this in Ephesians. He says, "For we are his workmanship." In other words, he's doing a work. See, we're so busy trying to control and he's so busy trying to refine. And the two would go like this because he's trying to get us into a resurrection and a rapture and we're trying to put bread on the table, a car on the driveway, a roof over our head, clothes on our backs and maybe a little bit of fun and entertainment. And God's saying, "No, I need a bride." God saying, "I need a bride." We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Listen, the word of Joseph was that he would preserve life. That was his good works. But look at what it took in workmanship to get him there. Jesus took 33 years to come to adoption. Why? It's a process of time. It's a workmanship. We are created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained. In other words, God has prepared a path for us to walk that we should walk in them. Brother would say this way. He says God is looking for character from men and women who can conduct themselves as sons and daughters of the king regardless of circumstance, regardless of hardship, regardless of what seems his silence, his lack of movement. Because remember church, when God moves, he really moves. And so often there are so many things going on in the background preparing. And all that happens is God reaches down and he presses a button and everything goes away in a moment. You say, "Where did that come from?" He was there all the time. He was working all the time, but he's waiting for you to catch up to his plan. That's all that's going on. He says God is looking for character for men and women who can conduct themselves as sons and daughters of the king. He says God have mercy on us that we will do it and he will and he does. Now I want to close with one scripture here that was really the where this whole service came from. I read it in my devotions many months ago and it blessed me to no end and the Lord just put a message in my heart this message this morning. But I want before I read this I want to tell you this. I want you to see your God this morning. I want you to see your savior. I want to see your lord. I want you to see his power. But I also want you to see his ways. And we've talked about his ways. Let me show you his power. It's a very obscure scripture. Habacook chapter 3 says, "God came from Teeman and the holy one from Mount Perin. Sila. His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light. He had horns coming out of his hands and and there was a hiding. There was the hiding of his power. Before him went the pestilence and burning coals went forth at his feet. This is a God of power. This is a God of victory. This is a God that changes circumstances. But I want to focus on verse verse six. It says, "He stood." Parents, do you ever have those moments where the kids are doing something and you've been sitting for a while and then you stand? What happens when you stand up? When they've been misbehaving, they've been talking. They've been fighting. They've been whatever. When dad stands up, what happens? Everyone gets quiet. Uh-oh. He stood and measured the earth and drove aunderder the nations. It the that phrase drove us under means he startled the nations. In other words, he took them by surprise. They thought they were secure. They thought they were established. But he stood and he startled the nations. He scattered them aunderder. And the everlasting mountains, the forever mountains were scattered. The perpetual, the ancient, the longstanding, the old hills did bow. He says his ways are everlasting. The constant enemies that harassed, that persecuted, that enslaved, that tortured, that bothered, scattered in a moment because he stood and came their way. Look at this. The everlasting mountains, the forever problems. Can I put it this way? The things that nobody has yet beat. The things that have bothered you all your life. The habits, the natures, the tryings, the sickness, the mind games, the offenses, the hardships. He says they scattered. Who's seen a mountain scatter here? Get ready. Get ready. Because when he moves, mountains scatter. When he moves, things that could not be changed change. Things that nobody could heal, he heals. Family that nobody could save, he saves. Natures that no one could get along with, he changes. That's the God that you're serving this morning. He says the perpetual hills, the things that are always in front of you when you look out your mo your house every morning. When I was in Calgary, it was so beautiful. There was two days there where we could just see the mountains so clearly. What's ever going to remove the Rocky Mountains, church? We would say nothing can move them. 10,000 ft of rock. Cold, hard, forbidding. We could take all the equipment in the earth and work for a millennia and not move those mountains. He moves it in a day. He moves it in a moment. Those things that are always in front of you, always standing, always taunting, always bothering, always holding you back. He says they'll bow. Why? Because his ways are everlasting. Look at Joseph. Joseph's a slave for 13 years. A prisoner. It differs on on the studies of it. Some believe that as early as a year into his slavery, he was in prison. 12 years of prison. Can you talk about a perpetual hill, an everlasting mountain, slavery, and now jail time? Never getting out, church. You're never getting out for raping a captain of the guard's wife. Never going to happen. And yet one day a messenger came and he walked out never to go to jail again, never to be a slave again. That's the kind of God we serve. One day God visited him in prison. One day God showed his hand. One day God stood and in that moment Joseph walked in to the time of his word. Hallelujah. Those ancient hills of slavery and injustice and false accusations bowed down before Joseph. Family problems bowed down before Joseph. Famine bowed before Joseph. Why? Because he endured the trying of the word of the Lord. [snorts] Let me put it this way, church. You know the Bible says you're a mountain. There are a lot of mountains. Satan has raised a lot of mountains. The kingdoms of this world have raised a lot of mountains in our lives. But guess what? There's only one mountain that will stand when this is all said and done. It'll stand the test of time. Every other mountain will bow before your God. Psalms 32, he says, "For the Lord had chosen Zion. He had desired it for his habitation. This is my rest forever. Here will I dwell. For who has desired it? I have. Your God desires you as his dwelling place. He says he will rest with you forever. Psalms 125 says, "They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which may not, should not, cannot, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever." And behold, I, John, saw the city of New Jerusalem coming down as a bride adorned out of heaven. Church, that's the day of your word when you come down. Bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, dressed in his righteousness for all to see. That's the mountain that will never be removed. Everything else destroyed. One mountain comes down and they bow before us. One quote as we close. You say, "I've had so many trials. I've just been dragged from pillar to post." He said, "Haven't I just told you that that's God?" because he trusted you. You won't fail him, will you? He says, "You might have fallen. You might have made a mistake, but you won't fail him now, will you? You'll rise up again like a real soldier, grip the sword, and come forward again." Amen. God bless you. Let's stand together. Amen. Anybody feeling like the word of the Lord is trying them these days? I should get a resounding amen out of that. Amen. Something's trying us. I trust it's the word of the Lord. Amen. Anybody got some mountains that won't move? Two. Anybody got some mountains that don't move? Where we pray and we pray. We trust and we trust. We believe and we believe. We try and we try and the mountain stands there taunting us. You can't go over, you can't go under. You can't go through. The word of the Lord is trying you. But know this, there's coming a time of your word when God stands and he says he's ready. &gt;&gt; She's ready. The work is done. Now the work is about to start. and he steps into our life. He steps into our situation. And all of a sudden, we see the salvation that we've been looking for. We see the healing we've been looking for. We see the deliverance we've been looking for. We see the fellowship we've been looking for. We see the provision we've been looking for. We get the answer we've been looking for. But you'll notice this, it always comes his way. And what we thought it was is not always what we'll be, but we'll get the answer that we've been looking for. Amen. God's got to get you ready for his glory. See, in all of this, Joseph knew, "I can't do anything." He was a total failure. But when can when it came down to the end of it, he saw God was in it. And so, the glory went to God, not himself. And from that moment on, you couldn't move Joseph. When Joseph came to a revelation that God's got it all in in his control, that God's the one that takes away favor and God's the one that gives favor, that God's the one that takes away position and satisfaction and all these things and puts me into these hard places. When he came to a realization that there was a purpose in it all, you couldn't stop him. And I'm trying to get you to understand this morning while you're in the situation, God's got it in control. There's a word of the Lord that's trying to bring you to the time of your word. Amen. Let's close our eyes if we would. God's trying to get you to a place where it's just you and him. So, I want to ask you this morning, if you've got a mountain, if you've got a perpetual mountain, an ancient mountain, a long-standing mountain that can't move, you think I want you to raise your hands to him this morning. You say, "Lord, I'm in a trial. I'm in a test. But Lord, all I'm asking you to do is keep me focused on you. Lord, get me close to you so I can come to the day of your visitation, ready to receive your promise." Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, Lord, how thankful we are, Lord, that we've got a message. We've got a word that shows us, Lord, the beginning to the end. But Lord, so many times in these hardships and trials, Lord, our eyes get focused on our five senses, the things that we sense around us, the things we see and touch and hear, Lord, and Satan goes to working and he builds a mountain in front of us, heavenly father. But Lord, you're a mountain moving God. Lord, you're a jailbusting God. You're a chain-breaking God. Lord, you're a mountain scattering deity. And so, Lord, I'm asking your grace for your people this morning. Lord, you see the many hands raised this morning. Lord, we're in a battle. Every day is a battle, heavenly father. Lord, I pray you give us faith. Give us power through faith, Lord, to stand the test. Lord, your prophet said to overcome was to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks and to know that greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Lord, may these mountains go before us. Lord, may these enemies scatter. Lord, these tormentors, these harassers that come after us day by day, Lord, may they bow in your presence before your word. Lord, I pray you help us to surrender to the trying fire. Lord, that character could come forth this morning, Lord. Lord, we want victory. You want character. Lord, I pray you help us to receive what you have for us by your way in your time, heavenly father. Lord, bless your people. Each hand that's raised, Lord God, it's an expression of faith. They defy gravity this morning, Lord, to express their need, Lord. And I'm trusting to express their faith, Lord, as they've heard your message this morning. Lord, bless your people, we ask, Lord, those that aren't here this morning, those that are traveling, those that are sick, those that are away. Lord, we pray your mercy and grace in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Through the fire again. 1272. So many times I've questioned certain circumstances. the things that I could not understand. Many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision and my frustration gets so out of hand. But it's I am [singing] reminded [music] that I've never been forsaken. I've never had to stand one test alone.

Let's thank him. You say, "Brother John, it's nothing's [music] happening." Praise him anyways. Amen. You see, when they went into battle sometimes when the God God gave them a victory, he told them of a victory and they walked out with praising [music] singers, musicians, they put them in front of the soldiers.
