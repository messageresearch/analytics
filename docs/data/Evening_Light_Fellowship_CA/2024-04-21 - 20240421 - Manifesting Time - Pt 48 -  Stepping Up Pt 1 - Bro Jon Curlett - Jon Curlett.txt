what you've brought us here for in a greater way than we've ever seen it Lord we pray you just Minister into our lives now this morning we're asking these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you turn if you would to 1 Corinthians 13 1 Corinthians 13 and God bless you it's good to see each one here today was talking with brother Dwayne Fair yesterday and he asked me to pass on greetings to the entire church send his love here so consider yourself greeted and loved amen God bless you each one and sister Brenda had a birthday this last week so we want to wish her a happy birthday amen and many more to come I want to uh congratulate my wife on her anniversary for getting uh 23 wonderful Years with me I'm kidding it hasn't all been wonderful by any means but God's been in it brother Bram said greatest thing God can give you as a man next to Salvation as a Godly wife I'm very appreciative for that this even this morning and certainly want God to bless her through the coming days and years and just continue to be with us as we step into a greater Ministry in our lives and just trusting him to be with us in it all amen it's good to see brother Mark with us this morning amen God bless you amen going through his procedure for his heart this week but just trusting that it's all worked out and we'll have them also for many many more years amen sister leise it's good to see you as well God bless you this this morning 1 Corinthians 13 it was funny I was talking to brother Kingsley on Thursday and we were talking about you know reading your Bible and sometimes we we read it and it can be a bit of form it can just be a habit you know and and the prophet of God told us he said if you don't see Christ in every page go back and read it again and I I told him I said I've been preaching out of First Corinthians for so long in this series and then I said I came up to it my devotions in 1 Corinthians 12 and I said that's basically all I've been reading for the last few Services it's hard to get some something more out of it when you've been just studying it and studying it and studying it so I said I went back and I read it and I said I went to reading my Bible till something new came out of it you know so that's what we've got to do this morning is we're going to preach from a very familiar portion of scripture but trusting we'll get something more out of it than we've gotten before 1 Corinthians 13:11 Paul says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child we all are children at some point nobody jumps straight to adult Hood he says but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known amen God bless you can have your seats this morning we're continuing our series on manifesting time and I want to take a a title a subtitle this morning of stepping up and we've talked about our adopted positions at different times over the last few weeks and we'll we'll we'll kind of revisit that a bit this morning and we read the quotes in the scriptures where brother B says God will present himself to a person and he'll speak to them and then he'll commission them and then he anoints them and then he sends them on their way to do his work and then if they'll stay true to it then he backs them up and they do the works of God himself literally on this Earth and you know we can paint this idea that when we come into adoption that when when God adopts us we're going to step up into a higher position we're going to step up into a more spiritual position and our lives will changed dramatically and I don't I don't say that's not true I believe it's true but I think for what we're going to see here is that for many of us where we are at is already our adopted position where we're at and what God has already done in our life God has placed us just exactly where he wants us to be and what needs to happen is our Revelation needs to increase about where we are and why we're doing these things and so what we need is a revelation of where God has placed us and what our purpose is and we'll find so often we're right in the middle of it and when we realize that this is not just me it's God then all of a sudden things start to change around us and Paul would say this just to read 1 Corinthians 13 again he says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things he says for now we see through a glass Darkly we don't see everything clear just now amen and I believe that's a reflection of the childish side but as you come more into maturity he says that then face to face now I know in part now I have a a portion of what is real of what is true of what is mature he says but then shall I know even as also I am known so Paul points that we have to mature in the natural but he's speaking to Believers so we've got to mature in the spiritual and he says so when we come into Christ we're going to think in a way that is childish we're going to understand as a child we're going to we're going to speak as a child but as we come into maturity we put away those childish things and Paul says there's three things that we have to change we have to change our speech we have to change our understanding and we have to change our thinking because they have to move from Childish thinking childish CH talking childish understanding now into manly or womanly ways of doing those things and you'll find that one feeds into the other you can't just go all three at the same time but you've got to get the first one into into the adult side and then the next one will fall into the adult side and then the next one will fall into the adult side amen and the first thing we've got to get right is our thinking because everything starts up here that's that's the great Battlefield and what does mature thinking look like it brings everything back to the word that's what a mature believer does is they filter everything back through the word and no matter what we we have in terms of thoughts and positions and opinions we always bring it back to the word it doesn't matter what the world is saying it doesn't matter what social media is buzzing about it doesn't matter what the Norms are today it doesn't even matter what our church Traditions are amen but what we do is in our mature thinking we say what does the word say about this and we bring our our thinking subject to what the word says amen and where the word is silent we're silent you'll see brother Brown talking about in the seals he says where the word or in the church ages rather he says where the word is silent she is silent as well because that's what we saw we talked about this in the last few Services under the under the the law of Moses they had it written but then the priesthood came in and they added to it with the oral law and they made up things Jesus said you're preaching for Doctrine the teachings of men it was the oral law of Moses and they said here's how we're going to be more acceptable to God here's how we're going to be more holy here's how we're going to be more Sanctified and we're going to do all these extra things and God had nothing in it God didn't accept it as anything God didn't accept it as worship they did it as unto God but they were adding to their own burden and it had no spiritual benefit to them or their family it just made life more difficult and then we talked last so that the Antichrist Spirit mimics the holy spirit because the the pattern of God is to take a thought and to speak it into a word and then that word Goes Forth with power to manifest what was spoken the thought becomes reality and this is what this whole series is on is manifesting time it's about the word coming into reality in our flesh and we know that what happens is that Satan and an antichrist Spirit does the same thing is he gets something into our thoughts and then from our thoughts it turns into a saying and then from a saying it turns into a Doctrine and then from a Doctrine it starts to live in our lives and what do we have we have an antichrist thought that produces an antichrist life because the source the origin becomes its Destiny you can't start with Antichrist and come out with Christ amen it has to be brought subject to the word amen it's the reality of the original is the Antichrist and that's what's coming out why because the thought was contrary to the word in the first place and so the fruit of it must be contrary to the word that's why denominations fail every time so we've got to get our thinking right and our thinking is set in perfect order by one thing and one thing alone the word of God that's what everything has to come through and when our thinking is right now it shapes our understanding and then when our understanding is right it shapes the way we talk Paul says this in 2 Corinthians he says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh we're in this fleshly body we're in this earth he says but the battles that we Face are not in this flesh in other words the things that we deal with today the problems the situations the people whatever comes our way is not of this Earth and this flesh amen it's not just situations it's not just people it's spiritual battles he says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but are Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds that means we don't have anything in ourselves that's going to win the battles that we're facing he says but in all of these things he says we are casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ see we think of ideas as thoughts as ideas or concepts or inspiration and these things are true but we have to check our inspiration by the word of God and I think I mentioned this before I I was talking with brother Steven strw one time at back when in BC and he says brother John he says I'm sure as a minister you you've noticed this he says you'll get this inspiration and you'll think it's amazing and then you get halfway down the line and you realize it's off you see how can that be possible because Satan is trying to get us off the mark constantly and so here's the thing and when we spend time on the word when we spend time thinking about God then the holy spirit is there to Quicken our thoughts but here's the thing Satan is there to try and Quicken our intellectuality our religious nature whatever it is and he's trying to get us to go down a slightly different path just a little bit off and then what happens is we've got to check our pride against the word and say wow that was a great idea and oh it's off well what am I going to do with that am I going to Humble my inspiration to the world word or am I going to press through and try and force it through the word and that's where we get into trouble amen we need to bring every thought subject to the word and Paul's saying listen the battles we think the battles we Face we think it's people we think they've got a problem with me we think that that it's just the boss doing this we think it's just this or that or the other thing but Paul says no no no you've got to understand this is a spiritual warfare that you're going through on a day-by-day basis amen that what we're doing is what it's spiritually natured not just carnally natured and when we start to look at that that means we can have Grace for the person that's giving us the hard time because it's not them it's a spirit in them and they don't even realize what's going on there's something that's pushing them and many times when they're done they don't even know why they did it they can't even explain why they got so heated up about that little thing that you did or said that triggered them and all you're doing is living a Christian Life you may not do anything wrong and it causes something to spark in them and it it just causes them to react in a certain way and you sit there saying what did I ever do to you what is it it's a spiritual warfare amen and so in those things we have to bring everything natural subject to the spirit because we have these five senses in our flesh and we've got those five internal senses of of our conscience and memory these different things and when something flares up our reaction our right is to flare back but Paul says no I'm trying to elevate your thinking now to understand that this battle is not going to be won he says by our carnal weapons he says the weapons of our Warfare aren't carnal but they're Mighty through God the way that we fight is different than the way everyone else does but as Believers we ought to be able to stop and say this battle is not about me it's not about the person it's not about the situation I'm caught in the great battle between good and evil between the word and the Antichrist and if we can stop and sit back and say what's really going on here it'll allow us to win the battle I I've talked about this before that in the animal kingdom we are the only ones that can separate our reaction and our action when something happens we are the only ones that can say I'm going to respond differently than the action really ought to ought to put me into you know you look at I've talked about it when we were at the San Diego Zoo and that Cub came up and it it it it bit the Father the the big male lion on the rear end and he turned around he a separate those things Paul says we ought to be able to separate what happens and our response to it he says and we do it by casting down imaginations by every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ what was Christ's obedience the word I sister Betty had mentioned a service on the pride of life and I was listening to that this week and the brother was was preaching about Christ and he says he humbled himself to the word everything he did was humbled to the word and he made himself of no reputation he took his right to respond with authority with power with righteous indignation he took that completely out and said what does the word say I should do in this situation that's all he could do and Jesus this was his testimony in John 5 he says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life he says and they are they which testify me Jesus said compare my life to the word and see if there's any Gap see if there's any difference he says my life is the word there's no difference between what the word says and how I live he says how can you judge me you think your Sal is in that word and your salvation is standing before you in flesh he was completely obedient to the word his thoughts were subject to the word and what happens after our thoughts are subject to the word is now our understanding changes amen we don't understand as other people change amen our thoughts when they're put together correctly they produce understanding and then we realize like Paul said we're not going to win this battle by ourselves amen all that happens when we do it our way is we keep the battle going that's all that happens it's just another day another day it's another cycle right and we're going to go around the mountain again and again and again until we get off and say let's let God have his way in the situation and lay down our rights lay down our preferences lay down our our Traditions whatever it might be and say Lord what's the spiritual battle here that's really going to be won because that's the one we're looking for amen Satan loves to keep Wars going and he does it by keeping us in our flesh and our thoughts and our rights and these different things and I believe that's a battle every day as we get up is to say Lord help me see the battle for what it is help me see the battle for what it is don't let me get caught up oh if we're tired out if we have a poor night's sleep if the babies have been up if we didn't get our breakfast or our coffee just right and what happens is it's so easy to slip back into the kernel but Paul says elevate your thinking step up a little higher and recognize what's going on and as soon as our understanding changes what's the understanding it helps us see the real the real issue and that's discernment for a Believer is to step back and say what's really going on here and what matters and then what we start to look at is Souls rather than people and we look at the Eternal purpose rather than how this feels to me right now but as soon as our understanding changes then what happens after that our speech changes brother Brandon would talk about that parrot that can repeat everything that's said around it he says but if you have him talking to a a professor from Princeton the parot can't have a conversation with them he's just repeating something he has no understanding he's just a parrot he says but when we get understanding we can talk about it our speech changes we can take it and apply it in our lives amen and now what happens is as our understanding changes what comes out is the word we speak the word and with that word comes Authority with that word comes power with that word comes love with that love comes Merc with that word comes Mercy Grace whatever is needed to resolve the spiritual battle is what comes out of our mouth instead of just trying to what it down and get the the physical victory over the situation or over the person amen our reactions ought to be overshadowed by one thing what's going on here and what is the word tell me to do in that situation that's hard to do so many times because Satan likes to put a time crunch on us but that's why you need to be prayed up that's why we need to be feeding on the word constantly is so that what comes more or less immediately to mind is what we've been feeding on because God never leaves us without an answer God never leaves us without the solution God doesn't leave us without the direction and so if we are prayed up if we're ready to face the battle then what happens is we walk in and God just walks right through our life and takes us right through it the way he wants to do it that's what happens amen God's purpose stands higher than our rights in those situations that's what you'll find is Lord why is it me that's in this situation because here's the thing if it was just carnal they'd be bickering with each other they'd be fighting with each other the situations would be going to other people but it happens to us because we're there to represent Christ we're there to help give the right response we're there to help show what the word would do in these situations if we take it back to our opening scripture in 1 Corinthians 13 Paul says all of this is putting away our childish things our thinking our understanding and our speech they're brought into subjection as that child of God comes into their purpose as they come into adulthood as they come into maturity amen listen we we we come in and we give our lives to Christ and we say a lot of things we understand a lot of things we think a lot of things but as it as our lives grow and as our lives mature under the preaching of the word the hearing of the word the reading of the word and the the the quickening of the spirit what happens is we start to see there's way more than we thought to what's going on there's way more to me there's way more to you there's way more to what's going on around us and what happens is those old ways of thinking those old ways of understanding those old ways of talking they go by the wayside and quite often we say boy was I ever childish boy was I ever silly was I ever arrogant really that's what you'll see in ch in children is that arrogance it's always a funny thing when my youngest at four years old tries to correct me but he is so confident in his knowledge and understanding of things why cuz he's a child you'll find the further we go the more humility comes in to temper those things the way we we jump into situations what does it what changes us it's the Holy Spirit on the inside drawing us up it's the tutoring it's the maturing that comes with sitting under that tutor day in and day out and what is he doing he's helping you to see what God has for you he's helping you to see how God sees things not just the way that we see things naturally but in all of that he's helping us to see this is not happen stance where we are what we're doing where we're placed the situations we get into they aren't just happening to us right this isn't just Karma it's not just luck of the draw but for a child of God everything that comes our way is because of his purpose and we can rest in those things listen to this brother Braham says a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes he's a son he says in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of the baby Eagle that was hatched out under a hen he says you know that the eagle is the type of the True Believer well a farmer took an egg from an eagle's nest he placed it under a hen and in due time all the eggs under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got along fine with the mother hen but that little Eagle could not figure out the clucking and the scratching for food in the manure pile he managed catch this he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all what he could stay alive but there was no satisfaction it didn't make sense to him he wasn't built to eat and hunt for food the way they were he could make it work but he wasn't flourishing he says but one day from way up in the air the mother Eagle that had laid the egg she spied the little Eagle on the ground and she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to her he says he had never heard heard an eagle cry but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out toward it he had never known what it meant to fly he did not know what this thing was but something in him wanted even without understanding he says but he was afraid to try something in him is longing for it something in him is responding to the Cry of his origin but he's scared to do it because he's never done this before all the chickens around him were saying don't you go over with that group of people don't you believe that message don't you step away from this denomination don't do it look everybody else is sticking around what are you doing out there stay here stay safe that eagle kills chickens he says but again that mother screamed for him to arise in the Wind didn't follow her he screamed back that he was afraid once more she called out screaming that he tried God won't stop calling until we respond praise the Lord amen he never stops screaming to his children he never stops pulling he never stops drawing us back to him you we say I'm scared I don't know I'm unsure he says just try amen just try just try he says beating his wings he hurled himself into the air and answering the Cry of his mother he soared off into the blue skies now that looks like he took off on the first try and brother brandom as he tells his story it's a madeup story but yes he had does it on the first try but I know I've read the story of The Little Eagles and brother B would talk about they come out of the nests the first time and they just tumble to the ground but what does that mother Eagle do she swoops down and she grabs him before they hits the ground takes them up and says try again why cuz you're built for this we fail the first time we fail the second time we fail the third time doesn't matter church we got to fly because we're Eagles and as we mature as we grow what happens as we start to fly and then we start to control how we fly and then we start to control where we go and how we land and what we eat and all these different things our flight gives us the freedom that we need to be an eagle he says you see he always was an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard the call of the Great Eagle he came to his own place and once a true Son of God hears the Cry of the Spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'm not here because brother Gerald I'm not here because my mom and dad dad brought me up in the message I'm here because I heard a a cry from Heaven that called my name that called my name and that's what I responded to was a Heavenly cry not a pastoral cry not a parental cry not a friend cry but it was a cry from allmighty God saying you are my beloved Son come up a little higher Paul would say it this way in Romans 8 he says for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear fear put them of the presence of God he says the spirit we have is not again to fear it is to draw us back he says but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father what our response when we hear that cry is Daddy Daddy and all of a sudden we're drawn to that and we trust him and we believe him why because a father will never do anything for our harm it's always for our good he's always there to bring about that which is best for us that's the Father's Heart and so we respond we say Daddy and whatever daddy tells us to do we do it because we're trusting daddy amen we're looking to him I want to take all those thoughts that's my my Preamble this morning and put it into one big thought this morning because we're talking about elevating our thinking elevating our understanding stepping up into the word of God we're talking about recognizing who we are as children of God we're talking about recognizing the battles we fight and what's really going on behind the scenes that they're not natural but they're spiritual and then we're talking about stepping up into maturity but I want to read some quotes from the last Service as we kind of get into our main thought this morning we end it with these last few quotes he says the church positionally we're talking about adopted positions the church positionally before the foundation of the world these are the thoughts of God about the body of Believers he says when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you no what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that he placed you positionally and we can look at the things that we're doing we can look at the positions we have in life and we can say well that's just who I am or that's just what I chose or even I didn't really have a choice this is what life has put on me that's not what Paul is talking about that's childish thinking he's saying no no no brother bram's saying where you are and what God has placed you into is your adopted position and we think that all along it was us making choices no it was not it was God using us God setting up things you think about how many billions of people are in this world and I had to meet one woman what are the chances of meeting the woman that that that that fills in the two weaknesses that I have what are the chances without stepping on my strengths impossible but With God all things are possible amen we don't just get married we don't just have kids we don't just have careers we don't just go to a church we don't just move to a country we don't just come into Ministry no these things are ordained of God to bring us into the body of Christ as he ordained us before the foundation of the world where you're sitting today what you're doing today is ordained of God that's what mature thinking would understand by the word of God Amen we need to come out of our childish thinking saying this is just life this is not life This Is The Life of Christ in you in your place and in your position that he has ordained you to be in today right where you are I want to read one more similar quote before we move on just to drive this home on this thought of stepping up brother Braham says nobody can take your place no matter how little we're going to talk about this later brother Bram says God will spend a hundred years getting a man ready for 30 minutes of work and we're going to see how critical those 30 minutes can be sometimes that you can be in your position you can be faithful as a wife faithful as a machinist faithful as an accountant faithful as a preacher and all of your time and effort and faithfulness is down to one moment in your life where you will do an act in the stead of Christ perfectly for the sake of another soul and all of what you've done through that time you've been in an adopted position but you just had one work to do and all that faithfulness all that believing all that trusting was to get you to that one place so he could manifest through you and bring another soul to Christ that's how powerful his thinking is when we can latch on to it then when when it seems there's no purpose nothing's happening why am I here what am I doing sometimes he's just got us there for that little moment and that's all he needed from us but nobody else can have that little moment just you no matter how little it is he says you say I'm just a housewife nobody can take your place God in his great economy has so set so the body of Christ in order till there is no one can take your place he said how I would like to take Billy Gram's place any of us ministers but we can't do it but just remember Billy can't take our place see we all have a place some of us are evangelists some prophets some teachers some pastors whatever we are some Housewives some mechanics some Farmers Whatever It Is God has set you in your place and nobody else can take it Church he's preaching this after the opening of the seals If That Matters to anybody here the word is open and he hasn't changed his thought on this he preached adoption before the seals were open he preaches this three kinds of Believers after the seals are open and he never changes this thought he places us where he places us and that's your adopted position see we want to look at adoption as it's all signs and wonders brother Mark was sharing something a minister said recently he says and we Overlook the power of the Holy Ghost that gives us an overcoming life when nobody else can but he wants us to have the overcoming life before he wants us to have the signs and wonders Amen brother Braham says God has set you in your place we think we chose we think we decided we think we moved we think we planned and no no no God has placed you in your place we're here by his determination not by ours I'm not saying we don't get out of his will at times amen I've been there done that I was talking to a a brother a while ago and he he lived in a certain place that that I've been and and uh I asked him what he was doing there and he says I was I was living out of the will of God yeah and here's the thing in that place he was in his ordained position but he was not in his ordained place he was doing the work that God had called him to but he wasn't where God had called him to do it and so he said I had nine months of being out of the will of God before I finally got out of that situation he said and nothing good came out of it nothing good came out of it why because he had gotten out of God's Will and he had to pull back and go back to where he left God and get back in his will and find what God wanted him to do Amen brother Bram says here you can be an adopted son of God and your adopted position is a mechanic so spiritual see how simple it is church brother B how often would he say he would he would quote Jesus saying and he says father I'm so glad you've hid it from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babes it's the Simplicity of the re revealing of God in little people that's all it is and because it's just a little one here and a little one there and it seems so simple we go right over it we've got to make sure we don't go over it church that's my point let's not lose sight of the of our position to recognize where we are and what we're doing see it's our human nature to minimize these things and then our religious nature comes up and tries to over spiritualize all the things that God's just like yeah whatever literally where you are and what you're doing that's what God is caring about and he's placed you there for a reason and we say well that's just my vocation well I'm a mom because that that's what we do when you get married and you love a man you have his kids and you stay at home no no that's where God has placed you and we'll see in the next service that God can hold back kids and God can give kids for reasons and so we don't just have them each and every one is ordained of God for purpose and each and everything we do is ordained of purpose you can be a mechanic and an adopted son of God in your position as a mechanic that is your position as mechanic it's not to come and sit in the Pew that's our reasonable service but your position can be as a mechanic and if God has placed you there then God will back you up God will bless you God will meet your needs God will make you a witness God will make you a servant and you'll be a Godly mechanic not just a mechanic you'll be a Son of God mechanic not just a mechanic and people will see the difference between what you are and what they are amen I said this before and I don't do it to raise myself up but I say we are witness and a testimony and people are looking whether we realize it or not back when I was in Texas Texas is Bible Belt everybody there is a professing Christian and me and another young engineer were were at this company and he left after a couple year or he left after a year just before I did and before he left he said I thought I was a Christian until I met you why he saw a difference in how he lived and how I lived not just in how we spoke but how we lived and he said I appreciate you letting me see there's more to this Christian walk than what I had something along those lines and we're still friends to this day why I don't believe that was my adopted position but I believe everywhere we go everywhere we go we are a servant and we are a witness of Christ amen but I believe like I said that we can be in our adoptive positions a long time and not realize this is my work this is my work because what is the Revelation that the church needs to have to go into Rapture her position in Christ and if we're sitting here and we're thinking that we're just walking through life waiting for something to happen at the end we've missed it we're in it all along brother brandham says we can always look back with perfect clarity and we're always looking to what God's going to do but can we see what he's doing right now that's what the Holy Spirit does to the believer is it shows them what's going on when it's happening because he's trying to reveal his Secrets he's trying to he's trying to reveal his will to his family so we're not walking through this with our eyes darkened but our eyes of understanding now are opened so that we can see what he's trying to do in our lives I read that's why I read this quote earlier where he says that a Son of God can go along time before he realize he's his son I believe and this is just me I believe you can be in your adopted position and not even realize it I think you can be in a position a long time before you realize I've got Authority I've got power I can have expectation in the Holy Spirit for God to move on my behalf when I'm in this role Amen brother Braham said it this way he says the new birth is Christ it's a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together all the ones that have had a new birth he says where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest he said oh if the church only knew its position the cry his heart this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says if we only knew our position if we only understood our position he says it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is brother brah said some of us our adopted position is in the five-fold ministry but we're not all in that as we read the scriptures that Paul said our all teachers or all Apostles or all evangelists do all have gifts of healing do all have gifts of Miracles do all have gifts of tongues he said no he said when we come together does everyone have a Psalm does everyone have a a tongue does everyone have a no he says no that's not the way it works brother saying each of us has a portion and you got to realize what your portion is and get focused on being Christ in that portion amen what is it we need to come in a Harmony of revelation of my place in Christ and your place in Christ cuz the Harmony and Revelation was and I is when I recognized my place in Christ and I recognize your place in Christ because I've got to know where you fit to make sure I don't get in your way and you got to know where I fit so you don't get in my way and we can work now hand in hand because we're under the same anointing amen and if we're under the same anointing then what does it do it compliments rather than brings chaos because otherwise what happens is we start trying to defend our turf you know I I I was talking about how I teased brother Paul when I came here and I said now that you know we've a you know a a real Minister here I'm going to take over Sunday school but you know what he never did he never pushed back he said if you want it take it he didn't defend his Turf and I felt so bad as I said after I did it because he he responded so perfectly is annoying why because it's God's will not his will amen but I would never do that because that's not my place I've been there I've done that and that was a stepping stone for me to come into Ministry but I've moved beyond that now and I can step back into it if God wants me to step back into it but God had already prepared a vessel for that and so in me recognizing where he fits I won't try and force my way in there just because well I'm a minister I know more I've got a different no no no let's let God place the gifts cuz why it's God revealed revealing himself in you and God revealing himself in me and it doesn't always look the same it's not supposed to be the same because each one of us has a lick of fire each one of us has a portion of the attribute of Christ and so you've got your place to be and I've got my place to be we're all different we have different places to serve different times to serve but we're all in one body working in harmony that's the unity of the revelation of Harmony is each in their place Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 2:12 he says now we have received not the spirit of the the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God what is another word for something freely given gifts he says we have received the spirit of God that we might know the gifts that are given to us of God it's not just blessings but it's people the greatest gift is a person filled with the spirit in their place that's what a real gift is is the person in their place led by the spirit that's the real gift because now it's the spirit using them it's not them using the spirit it's not them using the gift because without the Holy Spirit we just start tripping up over each other and it Le it leads to battles it leads to Kingdom building it leads to denominational carnal messes and like I said Turf Wars no this is my church this is my place this is my Ministry this that and the other thing not working together AB Braham says this in respects he says now God's begin to pour out the gifts upon us we see it he says now what is the gift of God today he says it's the holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost that's in us we've got to respect that he says we've got to respect it on every person it comes upon we've got to receive God's Divine gifts see what he's seeing there the Holy Spirit coming upon somebody the Holy Spirit coming in somebody is gifts and then the gifts of the giver come down potentially but the gift is the Holy Ghost he says when he sends those gifts no matter how real they are it'll never help us until we get to a place till we can respect it he said somebody can give a prophecy if you don't believe in that prophecy it'll never do you any good you've got to have reverence and you've got to respect it you've got to believe that it comes from God now catch what he says here believe it until it's proved wrong remember we read in 1 Corinthians 13 last time it said charity believes all things he says believe it until it's proved wrong if it's contrary to the word up front you know you don't have to believe it but if there's nothing to say it's wrong he says believe it until it's proved wrong then when it's proved wrong then you have a right to disbelieve it but and don't associate it with it no more but as long as it's being proven out to be the truth he says then believe it stick with it let that person be what they are but catch this he says now we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead of so much depending upon schooling and Upon Our programs and our campaigns and all that we have he says so we got to get away from that that human ability see that's the easy thing to say is well you know brother so and so he has human ability and therefore he's in that position no that's the gift of God to the body of Christ remember when Moses was building the Tabernacle God said I've come upon so and so and I've given him all knowledge to work in certain things and we'll see that as we go through that we have people in this church we have people around the Body of Christ and they make a living off of the gift of God but that gift of God is being used within the body of Christ and for the benefit of the body of Christ then we see it with brother Mark early on he's an IT professional computer science degree and he and brother Gerald he comes with the vision and says let's put the message online nobody else had done it brother Mark made a good living all of his life off of his IT background but now God steps in and he says let's start using that in a body work not just a family work not just a personal work let's do it in a bodyw work and so what does he do he catches a vision he sees the opportunity goes and talks to the pastor and pretty soon we've got the message going all around the world millions of times right what do they do they started a printing operation here and now look where brother Barry coffee is today Millions upon millions of books distributions planning all of of these things brother Joe coffee using his marketing he makes a living by it but now he's working and he has worked many times in fact his his career started with doing work for the body of Christ and now God says I'll let you make a living by it and what does he do he keeps giving back to the body of Christ with it his adopted position if we could put it that way is to help in that place with the body of Christ and we say that's not spiritual that's carnal no that's the blessing of God to put somebody in the body that can produce something that's of benefit to the body that edifies the body amen we need a place of yielding to the spirit he says we've got to get away from that that human ability subject our gifts to the Holy Spirit he says we've got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives catch this now Church even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic or whoever we are we got to Sur surrender completely to God and know that we are nothing he says then let God start from there then he starts moving and working he says and that includes all of us everyone that's the thing we got to do he says history proves that God always chooses the nobodies to become his somebodies God takes the person that's nothing so we see our adopted positions are not always obviously spiritual they are spiritual by the indwelling of of the Holy Spirit that's what makes it an adopted position is he gives us the spirit and then he takes us out and he sets us in a place it's not always about ministering the word it's not always about speaking it's not always about laying on of hands it's not always about gifts and tongues and these different things but they are nonetheless the ordained position for that person in the body of Christ Amen brother says this he says hold yourself Clean and Clear to your calling he says stay with God's word and don't move for nothing and stay abide in your calling if he gives you a job out there well I chose it I went to school I studied I moved to Texas I moved here I did this I did that he says if God gives you why because sons of God are led by the spirit of God if God provides for you then he has a reason to provide for you in that place and position if he gives you a job out there as a farmer Farm good if God bless he says God bless you at it and pay your tithe and whatever it is your offerings to help the ministry go on see he's saying there's two sides to this you've got to farm as a Son of God but you've also got to support the word he says if he made a mechanic out of you if he made a mechanic out of you there's a Dilbert comic where his what his mom takes him to the to the doctor's office she says there's something wrong with my boy and he's talking to her and he runs all these tests and in the meantime Dilbert's back in the background and he's working on a on a on a piece of equipment there and and the mother says is it okay if he does that and he says oh don't worry about that it hasn't worked in years and a couple slides later Dilbert just turns a switch and it hums to life and the doctor says I know what's wrong with him he has The Knack she said oh doctor will he live a normal life he said no he'll be an engineer right see we look at it that's just the way they turned out he says he made a mechanic out of you God made you what you are he made you the way you are with the strengths with the abilities and these things and it's for his glory it's for his glory see and we want it to be some great spiritual thing and all that he's wanting us to do is let the Holy Spirit flow through Us in whatever he sets our hands to do that's it so simple and if we can be faithful in that he may give us more and he may not that's up to him if he made a mechanic out of you and blessed you in that work stay with it and thank him for it see you just abide where God calls you why because he needs someone to show his love his mercy God needs somebody to show how He blesses a person God needs someone to show how a son or daughter of God handles trials and tribulations God needs somebody that can in every situation do the right thing and not get all fussy and not get all tired and not get all Snappy to not get all worked up in ourselves amen because we're not coming into adoption to express ourselves we're coming into adoption to express the father that's the purpose of adoption is to what place the son in the father's purpose and so in all of this our our our thinking has to elevate to recognize that we are where we are to witness Christ above all things above all things you know at work they were there was this big push and this year we were supposed to transition to a a new Crown Corporation and oh people were up in arms oh it's going to be worse and they're going to do this and they're going to do that and we're going to lose this and we're going to lose that and we're just going to become of this and we're just going to become of that and it was just down down down you know why I'm there to say why don't we wait and see why borrow tomorrow's troubles today why because they're overcome by a spirit of fear a spirit of worry and I'm saying hey I can see some really good things that could come out of this this and this and this and this I'm there to what be a Godly Ita not just an ITA but to be a Son of God ITA so that they can see there's a different way to live this life there's a different way to be in this position and it's one that can be done without fear and worry and you can have full honor and integrity in these things many times adoption means see we think adoption means I'm going to go do sometimes what we have to do is we have to stay and do that's all we're look that's all we're doing God has literally brought us to a place and we're looking to leave it and he says how about you just do my will where you are I built you I placed you I brought you and now you're trying to leave and go do something for me I've put all this effort into you why so you could stay right where you are right where you are catch a revelation that I'm trying to use you in this and then see what God will do in our lives what is it our thinking our revelation of where we are and what we're doing has to step up to say God's in it this ain't just me listen to how he talks about that son that was ready for adoption he says and being see the boy being a son already but yet if he wasn't a worthy son the father could not adopt him or place him in his own family he says he couldn't do it because the boy would run through what he had he was a Restless child he didn't have the ability to carry on with his father's work so the father just let him go on as a son he was already his son but if he was a fine boy if he was about his father's business and the tutor brought word to the father saying that the son is fine then he's eligible he's all right he says then the the father took the son out into a public place as a public testimony he put a special robe on him and set him up before the people and the father by doing this gave the son the authority over his kingdom over his business and so forth the son had the right to go out and do certain things in the king Kingdom with the same kind of authority that his father had he said he always was a son he always was in the father's business before he comes into adoption now all the father does is he he formally places him in Authority in that position he was doing the father's business all along but that son now comes to a place and he comes to a process and he comes to a ceremony and he realizes and everyone else does too I'm in this because my father wants me to do it he's built me to stand in this place he's built me to do this work and with that now comes authority to do what the work only the work not to run around because he said see what he said in the the previous one he says he would run through what the father had what he he wouldn't have the character and so he would undo all of the hard work that had already been done he'd burn through the money he'd run the company into the ground research on family-owned businesses show that usually by the third generation they're dead because the first generation built it the second one still has a a certain level of that work ethic and and appreciation for what's been done and the third generation just gets it for free and it's not passed on they don't see the sacrifice and so they tend to kill the goose that lays the golden egg right what does the son have to recognize I'm about the father's work not about mine that's it as soon as he recognizes this is what daddy wants me to do and he stays there in that role the father says now you're ready for the role you stay faithful to where you've been taught sometimes we're sitting here and our position isn't changing why because our thinking has to change and with the thinking comes the understanding of the situation with that the speech changes the life changes the way we go through our day-to-day changes and we start to say there's more to this than I thought there's more going on in my life there's more going on in these situations than I realize and God now can come in and he can start to show you what's really happening and he can start to use you because you realized he was in it all along you had to recognize your place and what he was doing in those things what is it we're stepping up into his Revelation not just being Earthbound in our own thinking brother says I believe we've been children long enough God's going to turn his church into manhood now he says and we played and frolicked as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood what is it it's maturity he says I believe it was Paul who said when I was a child I spake as a child because he thought as a child he says but it's time that we begin to think like men and women now for we've got to get down to business what is it what does it mean it means that you're not just a machinist now but you recognize I'm God's machinist I'm not just a housewife but I'm God's housewife I'm not just an engineer but I'm God's engineer I'm not just a preacher but now I'm God's preacher I've had gifts I've had callings I've had skills I've had abilities that's always been there but now we're starting to realize that it's his and what we're doing is all according to his will amen he says that's the thing that the church is if she only knew it being part of him with his spirit in her when God gave us the Holy Spirit it was him confirming we've got a place in a position not just here but in eternity he said the works that I do shall you do also greater than this shall you do for I go to my father a little while the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me and I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he says then it's Christ in you when you recognize your position when you recognize it's of his work and then he says it's Christ in you that's the shift he says you're connected together and you're heirs with him and if he was here on Earth what would he be doing the same thing he did there because he's the same yesterday today and forever one he'd be mindful about the father's business he says he'd be Healing The Sick he'd be performing Miracles he'd be doing just exactly what he did when he was here on Earth because he remains the same yesterday today and forever it's just perfect you can see see that with someone like Peter Peter was a preacher all along before the day of Pentecost Peter was a preacher but he was not an inspired preacher he was a parrot he didn't have the experience he needed of the infilling of the Holy Spirit he didn't have the new birth and so he could change people's physical beings but he couldn't change the heart he couldn't save them and I know that Peter can't save him but you understand what I mean his ministry could only do the signs and wonders but it couldn't change Hearts that's not what he was out there doing he was demonstrating the power but he wasn't demonstrating the power of a changed life and he couldn't bring that to anybody else but as soon as he is there on the day of Pentecost and he's filled with the spirit now he's charged he's anointed he's been given his commission he needs the anointing and as soon as he gets that anointing he comes down and 3,000 souls are saved we've read that quote where brother Bram says he came down an inspired teacher inspired he was a teacher before he was a preacher before now he's inspired why he's unlocking he's got the keys to the kingdom he was always in the role but he needed the Holy Spirit to place him exactly where he needed to be brother BR says this he's speaking of Christ he says now we see reflected in him a perfect Masterpiece he was so perfect like God until he said if I do not the works of my father don't believe me you can't believe me believe the works for they testify to you who I am he says I like that see they said you're a man and making yourself equal to God he said if you can't believe me believe the works that I do and if I don't do the works of him that sent me then you don't have no right to believe me he says look at my life and see if that reflects my claim he says so ought every Christian today to have that same testimony that's a mouthful he says if in this promised word of God if our lives don't qualify and meet EXA actly what the word said then we have no right to call oursel Christians if we're not born again Jesus said in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe see not they may they ought to or they probably will they shall do it he says that's the sculptor that made us that's the church that's hewed out that's the body of Christ he says now we find it reflected in him perfectly the sculptor now had the word reflected in the Masterpiece again called his son God Emanuel he says just think that a person so yielded until God identified himself in there in that body and him and God became one we talked about yielding I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me I do that always which pleases the father he says what if the Christian could have a testimony like that he says you would be a masterpiece right here on the street Church let's not leave it up here with Christ he says if you're a wash woman out there behind that washtub you still be a masterpiece to God he says when you can say I do that always which pleases God he says and the whole world can see the work of Jesus Christ reflecting in you we're speaking on stepping up this morning when I was studying this it brought me in remembrance of the the prophet John in the Book of Revelation and in the first three chapters the scripture says John was in the spirit on the Lord's day and that Spirit came to him and it talked to him and it was at a certain level you notice that John was in the spirit but it was in the spirit on an Earthly level and what did he see under that Revelation it showed him the seven Church ages it showed him the future of the Gentile Church it showed him the effect of Satan it showed him the reward for the Overcomers and we're glad he showed us those things we're glad that we got to see the seven Church ages but you'll notice that after that in Revelations 4 Christ says come up hither come up higher come up here and he took them out of the earthlies and he brought them into the heavenlies and what did he see up there church because John to this Point's an Earthly Prophet why everything is focused on what the flesh sees the loss the failure of the church the work work of Satan and the little bits of goodness that we do here and there and that's the Earthly SE that's the Earthly scene that that that was painted for him but now John comes up a little higher and what does John see John sees the Eternal purpose of God he sees a seven sealed book he sees which is what the Lamb's Book of Life and what he sees now is not what the is happening on Earth he sees what's happening in heaven to influence what's on Earth John sees a bride John sees himself John sees the sacrifice John sees the mercy John sees the overcoming John sees how God's going to do it all when he comes up into the heavenlies what is it he stepped into a higher Revelation a higher understanding an eagle's view God's view of things all that John saw in his Earthly Revelation was pretty much failure first one he saw Christ then he goes into Revelation 2 and 3 and he just sees a church that's going down down down down down down down down down down darker and darker and darker the spirit of antichrist working in it but once he gets a higher view John shouts John Praises John worships John takes his part John eats the book why he stepped up God took him to where he wanted him him to see everything see the big picture to understand what's going on behind the scenes and he didn't just give it to John he gave it to the bride amen he opened up that seven seal book for us that's what happened in 1963 he opened up that seven seal book so we could see our place and not just put it on a prophet not just put it on a Ministry not just put it on a fivefold group of men but that each and every one of us could come there and in reading this we could say our names in the book our places in the book our purposes in the book and with that the authority and power that God has placed in his bride to go behind those things we've got to have the same thing we've got to come up higher we've got to step up now I'm saying that like it's pressure I'm not I'm saying we've got to because he's done the work as in we're going to when I say we've got to I'm saying we're going to because he sent us a message that would open up these Mysteries that would open up this book that would restore us to the faith of the fathers and so now I'm saying we've got to by promise not by pressure we've got to by promise not because we're working hard but we've got to step up and what do we do then we start to say lord it's in your word that's all we're doing we're not praying for God to do something we're praying for God to fulfill what he said he was going to do we're saying be it unto me according to your word like Mary did why because he's open opened up in this book where we are going and what we're here for that's what this end time message is predestined to do is to prepare a bride Malachi 45 and 6 Luke 17:30 and Revelation 10 7 to1 all these different ones point to what the revealing the mystery of Christ being revealed in a bride through an end time message it's causing us to step up higher in expectation in belief in hope in all of these things brother BR puts it this way as we start to close he says and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication he says then that which is in part is done away with now people will look at that perhaps and say well that's the prophet's message the prophet fulfilled that how narrow sighted is that because if I if everything stopped with the prophet then where's the Holy Ghost today where's the anointing today where's the ministry to today where's Christ being revealed today if not in a bride anden that is not only the prophet he's saying when we have it when we have a perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then all the little stuff Falls away and what is it it's Christ coming into you and backing his word up that's all it is by simple Faith by simple obedience we step into what he's called us to and he vindicates his word through us Jesus said my words are spirit and life that means they can't stay dead on the paper on the page they need a body they need a manifestation point they need life they need somebody to live it through brother BR would say this he says all right to be born of the spirit now to be born of the Flesh and have wisdom of the world the wisdom will obey its fleshly teacher but he said to be born of the spirit is to believe and obey the teaching of the Bible by the Holy Spirit by the Holy Ghost see there's a lot of people reading this Bible there's a lot of people obeying this Bible but it's through fleshly Spirits not by the Holy Spirit and so what do they do they walk and fall into a ditch because it's just men Leading Men He says and a man that's born to the spirit will obey God's word regardless of what any tradition tells him it's just it he says you are reborn and that's the reason you see to belong to an organization he says put all your hopes in that he says to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit is to understand and believe with your heart that Jesus is Christ and this is his word that no other words can be added to it or taken away from it without your name taken out of the book of life he says that's a strong one if you add one thing to it in your tradition or take one thing from it well Christ said himself your name shall be rubbed off the book of life he says Now find organization or denomination in the Bible he says you'll run from it all right regardless of the flesh denomination teaching is contrary to the Bible he said yes Born Again means a new birth from above or birth from above he says then we are active in the things from Above This is where we're getting to stepping up he says now we're active in things from above why for it is him himself acting in his word through you his Branch to the vine Born Again from above he says then we are active we're active in things from above for his life is in us which is his word vindicating the word itself he says the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you Church the greatest thing God does for a Believer is fills him with the Holy Spirit without that we're lost without that we are absolutely nothing we are doomed to fail but he says the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you do we recognize this morning who we are well I just got the Holy Ghost because that's what believers do no the word is made flesh in you he says the spirit Minds the word and is active in vindicating the word we've SE seen and heard great things to vindicate this message there's never been a message like it since the days of Paul the days of Christ nothing like it constant signs and wonders constant prophecy discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart never wrong thousands times thousands times thousands of times recorded in newspapers recorded on video recorded on audio tape all of these different things why to give us Faith to give us Vision to help us see that we a part of it it didn't come to vindicate itself it came to vindicate the people that would receive it as well amen we aren't just here we're not just living our lives and buying houses and driving cars into the ground and going on vacations and going to work uh 8 and n and 10 hours a day whatever it might be amen we're here to be a living hope we're here to be an expectation of the word being fulfilled and not just an expectation but a reality of it a Vindication of that word that we've been given and so we can come behind that and we can say God give me a greater reality not because we're asking for it but because he promised it you know the easiest way to get something from God ask him for something he promised see so often we're we're trying to bring something to the table we're trying to make the word of God work in our favor what we need to do is step into his favor by taking what he said and just saying Lord I'm going to pray for that I'm going to seek after that what you've already promised I'm not going to try and twist it I'm not going to try and manipulate it Lord give me what you promis let your word vindicate itself in me that ought to be our prayer amen we're not telling him what to do we're asking him to do what he promised that's what Israel did for 430 years was they cried out because of their task Masters Lord will you do it Lord would you do it Lord would you do it and then then there's a day when the clock stopped and God says I've heard the Cry of my people and he dropped down and nothing was going to stop their Deliverance nothing was going to stop their healing nothing was going to stop their provision nothing was going to stop them from making it to a Promised Land let's stand as we read these last two quotes he says if God when I was an alien from him so loved me that he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he saw something in me he saw something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you amen he says no one can take your place amen he says you're in God's economy no one can do it and he says that's his love to you that's his love to you he says then won't Your Love reach right back to him he says there's a love affair no matter what the sit situation is its circumstances are governed by this love that creates faith that God loves you and you love God and you love one another and that brings the faith he says all right then it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what God promised it would do you want what God has for you start reading the title Deed start reading your inheritance start finding your place in that portion start find finding your way in that book and then say Lord this is what your word says and what's going to happen when you do that is he's going to start to change your thinking he'll start to change your understanding and then you'll start to speak in the way that a son and daughter of God is is supposed to speak I'm not saying you're not there I'm saying like John we can come up higher we can step up I said it last service we're in a restoration process we're in a redeeming process that means there's always more until we're gone there's always more to be had there's always more to give there's always more to receive amen he says then it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what God promised it to do that's our rest this morning not in my performance not in your performance not in your greatness not in your gifts and certainly not in mine it's that he promised he would do it and God will never allow his word to fall short amen God bless you this morning let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord our hope is surely in you Lord our trust is in you our faith is in you Lord you are our anchor you are our steady Rock Lord You're a shelter in a time of storm but Lord so often Lord we get caught up and what these eyes see what these ears hear what these emotions feel Lord and we forget that it's a spiritual war we're in Lord that we're spiritual creatures we're Eternal creatures Lord Bound by time for this this short portion Lord Bound in this flesh for this Earthly walk Lord but we've got to come up higher Lord we've got to step up higher Lord as we come into adoption Lord as we see our place Lord we've got to let you change our mind change our response change our reactions Lord change our very approach to our day-to-day life Lord I pray you help us to step up this morning Lord and we can only step up as you Reveal Your word Lord as you reveal our place in your word as you reveal our place in this body so Lord I help pray that you'd help us to seek it Lord and in that seeking Lord may we find it Lord in That Knocking may you open up the door Lord and may you show us our purpose and our path Lord through the will of your word we pray Lord may your spirit just be within us day by day Lord where we get dry Lord where we fall short Lord I pray your spirit will wash us out and fill us up I pray Lord bless your people we we ask in Jesus
