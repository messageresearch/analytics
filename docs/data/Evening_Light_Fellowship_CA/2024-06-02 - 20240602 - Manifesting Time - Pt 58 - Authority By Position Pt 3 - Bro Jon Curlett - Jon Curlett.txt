You' be in the midst of us Lord and your purpose is to anoint us Lord with your word Lord to take your spirit and quick that word in our lives in our hearts in our souls Lord in every fabric of our being Lord and make it live through US Lord we're not asking for authority and power to run around and satisfy ourselves but Lord we're asking Lord for wisdom Lord for guidance Lord that we could be found walking in your will day by day Lord and in that will of your word Lord we'd find the authority and power Lord that the Holy Spirit brings Lord I pray you help us to settle into it this morning Lord that as we read your word Lord as we see ourselves there Lord may you just bring us to a higher level Lord of understanding of where we're at Lord but not just understanding in our mind Lord but a revelation Lord of what you've called us to be what you've called us to do Heavenly Father Lord what the word is that is to be fulfilled in our lives each one individually we pray so Lord touch us again this morning Lord Quicken us Lord to your word we pray Lord strip away these things of the world that hold us back lord even our own fleshly nature Lord may it just be set aside this morning Lord that your word and your spirit could have the preeminence we pray Lord grant it we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen turn if you would to John chapter 14 brother Matt this I think this may have been left on and I can't seem to get it open if you're able to to repair it for me amen God bless you it's good to be back uh my wife said you are definitely not a missionary you definitely don't like to travel because every time I come back I'm tired and I'm not feeling good and this and that the other thing and I just like to be at home with Home Folks amen so I'm I'm glad to be back but I did have a good trip in Nova Scotia in PEI I met with Brother Edmund Hagman and his wife sister Leah in PEI spent a couple hours with them on Thursday night had a wonderful time with them and Lord willing she'll be here um she's related to brother Carr and she's coming up with five other people including brother Carr for our special dedication meeting so we'll see her and he's hoping to come up as well for at least a couple Services they've got a farm there, Acres 130 sheep they just had 140 Lambs born in the last month or so so they've got a lot going on there but uh he's hoping to come in at least for a couple services so uh that would be very good but I certainly appreciate brother Paul taking the service on Wednesday night ien it's good to have somebody that can just step in like that and certainly appreciate it amen and then it's good to see brother Isaac and sister kzia here now we've seen brother Isaac of course last year sister kzzie I've seen her but most of you haven't um so it's good to have her there and you know I was thinking as they were singing the specials there's something about these Walsh leer people you know they come in and what do they do they put their shoulder to the wheel amen we've had uh the different ones come in brother of course we know that brother Dale has come in and done that very Faithfully but then his brothers come in and the sis their wives come in and they're singing and they're worshiping and then now you got the grandkids coming in and they're doing the same thing anden it's a good thing to see the spirit of God moving in in them amen that's a it's a wonderful thing so God bless you this morning for your special and playing in these different things amen want to remember s brother Bob sister Brenda as they head out for two and a half weeks to Ontario that they'll get a blessing and they'll be a blessing amen God go with you each one it was a good trip as I said and I had a few witnessing opportunities but you know we know this but sometimes it becomes abundantly clear what we believe is not for everyone it's not for everyone but what I have learned is that we can still help people along the way and that's usually what I find it turns out to be is you're just trying to help somebody to see a little principle a little thing that can just change a direction change a situation and if only they take that their life will at least be a little easier and maybe that will lead to something else where the next time something comes up they come ask you and say hey what would you do here what do you believe about this or how would you approach this and all of a sudden maybe there's an opportunity it's a it's a long game many times it's not always about just somebody's going to come to the Lord but sometimes it's that continuous witness that we give in our day-to-day lives even at work and these things that bring people in but uh it was is good and and uh I'm trusting the Lord to keep using me in those areas amen God bless you John 14:12 this is our scripture and we're going to be using it regularly in the coming services and Jesus says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing and and this idea of authority by position and and I want to take a third series or third day on this but I just want to point out something before we get into our thought this morning because we often quote this scripture in Hebrews 138 and Jesus as we opened in John 14 says you're going to continue the works that I do but remember brother Brandon would say my message is is to declare him that he's here and so often we read Hebrews 138 where it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and what we usually do is we go back 2,000 years and we say that was Jesus Christ yesterday and then we come to today and we say he's here today and he's going to be there tomorrow and he's going to be there working tomorrow but but the thing we know is that Jesus Christ did not start 2,000 years ago amen he did not begin 2,000 years ago the scripture says all things were created by Jesus Christ amen so he's been working all along and so what we have to see is not just Jesus Christ from 2,000 years ago but we have to see Jesus Christ from the very beginning because the works of Christ have been doing been been done all along through these times and I was reading in my devotions the other morning where God's talking to Moses and he comes to Moses and he says Moses I haven't even been known by my name Jehovah prior to now now we see Abraham would call him Jehovah Gyra but but but he says I'm not even known to a people by my own name he says until then I haven't been there he says and I'm coming down to be made made known to my people and I've heard their cries and I've I've come down to take out of their slavery but how was God revealed to the people of Israel it was first by Moses they never saw a pillar of fire they never saw a pillar of cloud they didn't see lightning in the sky they didn't see anything what did God do God sent them a promise by a prophet and God revealed himself through Moses and the scripture even says that God said I will make you a god unto the people and Aaron will be your Prophet the revealing of Jehovah was through a Prophet first and foremost and it's not until they leave Egypt that they actually get to see Jehovah in a form aside from a man and it is through the pillar of fire and it's through the pillar of cloud and these different things but the first revealing of God to his people was through a prophet that's how God works on these sort of things and Moses himself would then prophesy the coming Messiah and he would say this he says the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto him shall you hearken here hear ye him is what we heard on Mount Transfiguration amen but notice he says God's going to raise up a prophet he's going to bring a messiah like me what a thing to say God's going to bring you a messiah and he's going to be just like me but why was Moses saying that because Moses was revealing Christ to the people and what was it was Christ was coming now to reveal God to the people it was the revealing of God to the man to the to the to the masses so to speak and so Moses revealed God to the people now Christ comes and he reveals God to the people the same way but what was the thing with the Messiah he was going to come and he'd be Moses perfected that's the difference he'd be Moses without the temper he'd be Moses without the faults he'd be Moses without the failures he'd be Moses without the wondering what do I do here now but it would be a Perfection of Moses amen he'd be Moses he'd be the god Prophet that was ordained to come so the revealing of God was first through that prophet and why am I making that point because brother brandham comes in this age and what does he do he reveals Christ to us and he does the exact same works of Christ the same things he raised the dead he healed the sick he cast out demons he prophesied he spoke things into existence all of those things were done and what was it do it was revealing God to the people it was not God but it was revealing God to the people but remember Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what happened is when the prophet left did God leave no when the prophet left did the word stop no what follows the the prophet is what God himself revealing himself to the people God himself stepping down into the people God himself talking to the people God is revealing himself even not just to the people but through the people so it's a continuation of The Works through all of these things amen it's a SE second Exodus that's happening now brother BR would talk about a second Exodus and what is it it's a people that's been called out and set aside to be special unto God and it's called the bride and so the problem today is and I I heard a bit about this in pi is and and of course we know about this is we got people that think that message is still on the tapes and the problem is that message has to come into people that's the way it's got to go you can't say let's stick to the tapes the tapes have to become reality in your life and that's what God's trying to do is he gives us a message and then he comes down and he fulfills the message in the people the message is there to do something amen amen we notice that that Paul the prophet to the age he never forbade Peter and John from preaching or any of the other Apostles but yet that's what we would have we'll say oh oh you can only play the tapes well that's anti-rip there's always a following after Elijah didn't forbid Elisha to preach the start doesn't stop the Finish amen it's a continuation of the works of God that are going through and so Christ gave the commission to preach and he never stopped it he never said only Paul gets to preach' only read Paul's letters in the church no you have to preach according to Paul's letters but you don't have to just read Paul's letters in your church others wrote the books the Holy Spirit dealt with men according to the needs of the local body and so that's what we see in all of these things there's always a continuation of the works of Christ it does not stop with a man just because God used that man but it continually moves forward in these things now we spent last service and talked about Moses quite a bit and I I I kind of hate to do it this way but we're going to close out with a warning on Moses because we see that Moses failure uh at the very end of his life there but we know that Moses was the meekest man on the earth now we know what Meek means it means to have the power to do something but to choose not to do it you can but you don't amen and we see that Moses time and time again the people would backslide the people would Rebel the people would get whiny and they'd want to kill them theyd want to go back to Egypt they want to do all these things and time and time again Moses would stand in the Gap he just never seemed to be bothered he just he every time they did it he he just he'd go to God and he' plead for them and he had patience church if Moses can have that much patience with his people then how much more does God have patience with his people because Moses was revealing Christ amen and that's the patience of God that's coming through him but Moses never seemed to lose it but I want to ask you this morning why was God so longsuffering with Israel why didn't God just wiped them off and start a new because God had given them a word God had given them a promise God was not committed to the people God was committed to the word that he gave the people and he says I need a people to fulfill my word and therefore I'm going to take this people in they're my chosen people they're the ones that they've got that that's got to have it that's the patience of God church is that he has committed himself to his word amen and as long as there's a people to accept it then that's what's going to happen amen but I want you to see what happens we're going to talk about Moses failure because we're speaking on Authority by position this morning and we want to see where Moses fails in his authority as a lesson to ourselves it says this in numbers 20 for there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and the people ched with Moses and spake saying would God that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord Lord as soon as things got tough people started complaining and this is the nature of a faithless generation is unless things are perfect they're always complaining they can't stand the trial brother Brandon would call them hot house plants everything has to be perfect they can't be out in the storms they can't be out in the regular weather they can't have the ups and downs they've always got to have everything perfect that's not mature Sons and Daughters of God he says and why they said and why have you brought up the congregation of the Lord into this Wilderness that we and our cattle should die here they neglected to remember the pillar of fire and Cloud that led and held them every single time church we think the signs and wonders will hold us it has never held anybody the signs and wonders have never held anybody in scripture it's got to be something on the inside that connects you to the word that holds you the signs and wonders won't do it we see it time and time again in scripture he said and wherefore have you made us to come out out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or pomegranates neither is there any water to drink that's the promised land they're saying this isn't the promised land well yeah because you're walking to get there you want the blessings but you don't want to go in they backed away from those blessings if you remember and now they're complaining that they don't have the blessings they don't have them because they chose not to go in they chose not to take God at his word but yet how many times has God provided for them they have never gone without truly gone without they've had trials they've had stresses yes but God has always provided amen they forgot that if God leads you God provides you that's the simple thing church if you are in God's will then God will provide for your need this morning it's that simple if we can just hold that if we can find his will he'll he'll he'll Feed Us he'll provide for us it says and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly under the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and the there be strength God makes it very clear speak to the Rock that's all you have to do now watch this and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he had commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock you know I always wondered why Moses differed so greatly from what God told him to do he's about to do something that's completely different than what God told him and I often wondered why that was and we'll see why shortly it says and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rock he smote The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also I also wondered why God listened to his Prophet we'll see that as well he says and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them what do we see here church we see what happens when anointing combines with temper amen when anointing departs from commission and temper takes over and what happened here is Moses got angry for the first time for the first time Moses got caught up in himself and he got angry with the people and he turned into a me monster must I you know who started with the eyes Lucifer must I do this must I do that and he starts to chastise the people for their attitude for their approach God didn't but Moses steps in and he starts to take authority to himself amen we see that when Authority is removed from commission we get results but it's not always good results you can get results what's good good means in God's will good doesn't mean it always feels good amen we discipline our children for their good does it feel good no but we do it for their good Romans 8:28 says all things work together for good that's what God's good is is it works together for good it might not seem good in and of itself when you get a spanking when God withholds something from you but it's for your good in the end and we're going to see what even what the prophet would say about some of these things but listen to what he says he says look God told Moses you go down there this anointed Prophet The anointing makes all the difference he says Moses went down there in his he says go down speak to that rock Moses went down there in his anger why is Moses angry he's got the answer to the people Moses is frustrated because of how they treated him Moses has injected his pride into the situation how dare they talk to me like this how many times have we proven ourselves how many times has God proven and they treat me like this and he goes down in his anger he picked up the rod and said you rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and he smot the rock the water didn't come he smoted it again it came it was against God's will it broke every plan in the Bible he said Christ had to be smitten a second time see Christ was s smitten once he says Moses did it twice but Christ was only supposed to be smitten once it broke every it says it broke the whole plan he says but he gave him his permissive will then after that he said see we got the water for you yeah I brought it out for you you bunch of rebels what is it me me me I did this God said come over here Moses come here come up here on top you've been a faithful servant Look Over Yonder see the promised land oh Lord but you're not going over you took my permissive will down there at the Rock you've glorified yourself see and not me you Sanctified yourself you didn't sanctify me you didn't keep my original word what I told you to do yes the waters did come you can lay hands on the sick and they recover you can prophesy or speak with tongues he says but the thing is keep his original word he says God don't change his mind friend you've got to keep his commission his will now brother R would start to talk about something and for the sake of time this morning I'm going to summarize it but he says a man wrote me and he said brother Oral Roberts prays for 500 people in the time it takes you to pray for to he says you're the slowest man I know and brother bam wrote him back and he says God gave brother or Roberts a way to pray for the sick and God gave me a way to pray for the sick he's got his way I've got my way he prays in general he says I pray specifically it's a completely different way of looking at it and he said I wait for God to show what's done but I want you to see something here he says you know God uses sickness for whips to bring us to him God uses sickness for whips to bring us to him you believe that sure it is he says look at Job the chastening of the Lord but he says now you have to notice prophetic gifts can get yourself in trouble certainly can if you'll give me some Indulgence this morning let me add to it spiritual gifts can get you in trouble spiritual gifts can get you in trouble watch him prove it now he says now what if this man he's talking about something some man that's come up to be prayed for now what if this man had done something evil and I'm standing there great big what we call in America a bulldog faith and I grab a hold of him and I say hallelujah hallelujah Satan turn him loose glory to God and I take that disease off of him and God put it on him for a purpose I'm in trouble with God see he says God will heed your prayer but now you've got to answer for it because you've gone against his will cuz God's trying to build up the faith of the people and then when you fail he'll allow it to go through but you've got to come and pay a price for that now we're speaking about adoption and Authority by position and he's warning us what just because you can doesn't mean you should just because you can doesn't mean you should church can I talk about meekness here for a second because we said earlier meekness says you have power to do something but you chose not to do it why was Moses the meekest man on the earth because Moses had the power to speak and God would do it Moses could have brought judgment Moses could have brought destruction Moses could have taken his own enemies off the planet Moses had Authority before God to speak but the meekness of Moses was that he didn't let his personal pride get caught up and use his authority against people he held back that's what made him Meek was he had spoken word authority and he didn't use it except by God's Express command that was why he was the meekest man his character was in tune with God's will and his flesh was subject to God's Will and it brought everything else in line what is it adopted children in position have authority but we have to use that Authority according to our commission according to God's purpose according to God's will amen that's what's going to fulfill the word of God because otherwise what happens is we start to speak things into existence we start to speak into situations and we come into a place of spiritual Prosperity Gospel where we get everything we want that's not what God's here to do he's not here to give us everything we want he's here to help us fulfill the word for our day that's the purpose of these things amen so brother Braham continues he says you see what I mean he says now maybe you don't get it wait let me give you some scripture I know you won't doubt the scripture here let's take Moses how many believe Moses was a prophet a great prophet God told Moses go down there and speak to the Rock and Moses went down there and did what God told him not to do he smoted The Rock now catch this he but he smoted it and the waters didn't come and he smoted it again notice he SM he hits it the first time and God does not give him water why because God didn't tell him to do it God was giving Moses a warning you're out of my will Moses could have backed away and said folks I'm sorry this is not what he told me to do he told me to speak to the Rock and he could have backed away made it right and spoken to the Rock God's giving him an opportunity to correct his error but Moses persisted in his anger it's got to be my way and he hits the rock the second time time it says he had power to do it he was a prophet and the waters came forth that's right but what did God do God said come up here Moses said do you see the land Yonder you're not going in you didn't obey me down there at The Rock he had the power to do it but he had better watch the way he used that power what this is where true character is proven he says look at Elisha he was baldheaded and he was coming down the road and some little children began to say oh Baldhead old Baldhead why don't you go up like Elijah did making fun of them he says now that was all right them little kids maybe it was their parents that taught them to do that they were little fellows let me stop here he's saying little kids are going to be little kids church immature Believers are going to be immature Believers we're going to deal with people that are not at the same level we are and in this church we have a whole different range of maturities and guess what just because I'm your age and you're my age does not mean I'm as as mature as you or you're as mature as me and What's happen is we run into little kid issues amen come on let's be honest we run into little kid issues and what do we do we say they ought to be better than that they ought to know they do know better than that and what do we do we go straight to judgment we go straight to saying they ought to do this they ought to do that how come they're not this how come they're not that they're little kids in that area give them some Grace give them some Grace amen we're going to talk about that a little bit but notice how he says it was their parents that taught them sometimes we learn things from our parents sometimes we learn things from our spiritual parents hey we've got all sorts of little isms around this message and guess what we have little isms in this church and we don't realize it sometimes amen we've got little things we do by habit or by tradition and we make them into idols and when people don't do it the way we used to do it or the way we ought to do it or we think they ought to do it do it then what do we do we put them into a different category no no no let's give Grace amen let's give some understanding but he says what they were making fun of this Prophet but they got him angry and he turned around and put a curse on those children in the name of the Lord and two she bears come out of the woods and killed 42 little innocent children kids do things all the time that they ought not to do and he says they're innocent they didn't know any better he says now that doesn't sound like the nature of the Holy Spirit does it no kill them little children see but an angered Prophet see he cursed them children had to be recognized because he was a prophet he says see so you have to watch oh it's all about the ministry it's all no no no he says you have to watch why because you've got Authority in your position church that God will back up and you've got to be so careful when you step into there and we see here that temper is one of the greatest tools that Satan will use to get us to try and ab use the authority that God has placed in the believer's life we see it in Moses we see it in Elisha here we see it in David and it never has good response or good results temper is purely an emotional response there is anger and then there is temper they are not the same thing see temper is tied to self and you know how this manifests in most Believers righteous indignation but it's righteous indignation because how dare they do it how dare they say that to me how dare they treat me that way way or maybe we get even worse sometimes it's for somebody else how dare they treat somebody else that way and we flare up and what is it it can turn into a pride issue rather than a word issue and we see here with Elijah his Elisha his pride got worked on they started making fun of him they started challenging his commission they started challenging his experience Church the as soon as Elijah's taken up he takes the the robe and he smites the water and it Parts in front of him the double portion of the anointing of God is on him why is he worried about what children say just a distraction but Satan comes in and he gets him worked up over his his little bit of Pride that he had left and those 42 children died anden we got to be able to absorb these things Church we've got to be able to take it and either move on or react in love and mercy and Grace remember what Paul says in Timothy he says the servant of the Lord must not strive must not go back back and forth must not get the last word ouch must not get the last word I spent a bunch of time with somebody this weekend that had to have the last word on everything do you know how hard that is to somebody that likes to have the last word God was working on me what for that person's sake let him have the last word let him be what he wants to be just so you can try and do something for his life he says must not strive but be gentle unto all men as AP to teach patient he says in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves remember we could get angry we could use our knowledge of the word to destroy them we could use what we know to beat them down but we don't because it's not about beating them down it's not about winning it's not about winning it's about a soul that is all this is about church this entire gospel comes down to souls that's the the only thing that matters brother Bram said a soul is worth 10,000 worlds so why would we take the world or our position or our influence in the world and give it up for the sake of somebody's soul that response that we have we can respond we can react we can instruct in love or we can walk away we can walk away we don't always have to engage we're allowed to walk away but whatever we do we can't flare up that's the satanic side coming out he says why do we do it if God per Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth that by the things that we say that their eyes might be opened that they could make their life right the only opportunity they may have is the way we respond we're talking about adoption it doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun does it because now we're expected to act like Christ completely now we fail and we'll get into that a little bit later and we see it even in Moses here here but he says what that they will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will I had some conversations and I I've been you know just dwelling on some things and you talk with some people about this that that aren't Christians or or or don't believe this end time message and you can talk till you're blue in the face and they won't get it they won't get it but we can't get frustrated at those things we can't put those people out we just say lord they're in your hands anyways we're not going to argue them in we're not going to you know discipline them in or any of these things it's got to be God that does it and it's him that opens the eyes amen it's him that opens the eyes that they can come out of these things but you know I hate to finish on a bad note with Moses but Moses ended on a bad note it's the unfortunate thing is that he his failure stopped him right at the edge uh of the promised land and so God takes him up and yes God has a Heavenly funeral for him and these different things but I want you to see that Moses failures didn't stop the children of Israel moses' weakness didn't stop the children of Israel but what did it do it prepared the next generation of leadership to follow right behind him and continue on to the Fulfillment of the word and Promises of God it didn't stop them it prepared them we see what happened in numbers 27 that God says to Moses he says he says Moses take Joshua he has the spirit in him take him and bring him close to you and start to train him and get him ready because he's going to replace you when this is all said and done and so Joshua gets this this this front seat view of how God deals with Moses and what leadership looks like what it looks like to make decisions how to make decisions amen we don't just walk around and say I'm going to do this and do that but he saw what it meant to go into the presence of God and wait on God Amen he saw what it meant when you found the will of God that God always backed it up and it trained Joshua now so that when he goes into the land he's going to lead the way that Moses does and know we know when Moses is about to die he calls Joshua before the people and he ordains him to lead the people Moses didn't pick Joshua God picked Joshua amen we don't pick our positions church we aren't even supposed to pick men God picks men God picks Ministries and when we look in our lives God picks spouses God picks all of these things for us and he places them and if we know that God has placed us and God has picked us then we can have confidence in the results that are going to come out of it amen God will place Us in his time God picked Joshua before then but all those years he's training Joshua up and then finally God places him God picks span of time God places that's the adoption process we know that now watch what this looks like it says and Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord has sworn unto their fathers to give him to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it for the Lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed church it's a wonderful thing when the prophet comes and tells us what the promise is for our day amen he shows us the word for our day but let me tell you we've got to come to the place where God is making those things real to us where what's on 1200 tapes comes into our lives and it starts to become a reality inside of us and that's what he's saying to Joshua is he's saying Joshua you've got all the books now but now it's time to go be the book now it's time to get what's written in the book for this people and it's time to come in and go beyond God sent a prophet to say what is that Prophet supposed to do he's supposed to give us a restoring message the message is supposed to do something it's supposed to produce something it's not just intellectual knowledge it's just not understanding scriptures it's not just signs and wonders but it's a word that has the power to transform us into Sons and Daughters of God that are going into resurrection and Rapture the word is power to transform amen it's not just to sit there but you know after this Moses died and you know I I finished the book of Deuteronomy a couple of months ago and when I read where Moses died I literally wanted to cry in all seriousness I just sat there and I felt like mourning because we saw all that Moses did and he was near perfect and he was so essential and he stood in the Gap and he held the people together and he kept going forward and his patience and his longsuffering was just immense and the people never recognized what they had they truly didn't understand how good of a man God had given them and the pain and the suffering and the torment that Prophet went through on their behalf and so when he died we know the whole the whole of Israel went into mourning and and they just couldn't move forward but I love the way that God works because we go into places and we know that we Face trials and heartbreak and sorrow and and even our own failures and we go into a place of mourning or maybe even depression but God never leaves us there amen we can choose to stay there but God never leaves us there he always makes a way of escape and so he brings now a man that can take them out and take him into the land that he'll pick up where Moses left off and there'll be no loss in the continuity of the word the leading of God that's the way God does it is he always gives us a way of Escape he gives us a way to move forward amen he doesn't just leave them with a prophet's message let me say it again he doesn't just leave them with a prophet's message but he himself comes down to take them into the reality of that message that's what I'm resting in is not that we got a message that we've got a God that's behind that message to bring us into the reality of it amen God comes down with a visitation and his purpose is to fulfill fulfill the message in our lives and me to fulfill the word for this age but Watch What Happens now because Joshua's been with Moses he's been in the presence of God with Moses but now Moses is gone Moses is gone now Joshua's got to learn to walk on his own two feet before the same God Watch What Happens here it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead I remember when brother Paul lonan was preaching this and I was listening to it he was here preaching it and I was listening to it over in BC and as soon as he started preaching this it was like the spirit of God swept over me and I just wanted to get in there and preach with them I don't think you can have two preachers preaching at the same time but I want to be right there with them because it just jumped out to me how this moves forward he says now therefore arise get up put off the morning ashes move forward God's not Dead The Prophet's dead but God's not dead he says go over this Jordan thou and all this people under the lamb which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place Hallelujah every place if you can read it you can have it if you'll walk by faith I'll give it to you you just have to walk Church you just have to walk but the thing is we forget that it takes time to walk we've got to fight to make those steps so many times and what we do is we get fighting and we say it's too much and we back away no every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you what as I said unto Moses see the continuity of the word here it's not just to one man church it's to the Believers it is to the multi-member body of Jesus Christ and so God just Carries On the word didn't stop when brother brandham left the Holy Spirit didn't go away when brother brandham left but God didn't stop speaking when the prophet left but now he's come down in a multi-member bride and she is the last voice to the last generation it's the last thing before we go he's still here he's still with the bride he says and from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even under the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast you know the Palestinians they're saying from the sea from the ocean to the River from the sea to the river too bad joshua4 says it belongs to Israel they'll never get it but they want it but the promise of God stands sure it belongs to Israel verse five there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake you that's my scripture church that's your scripture I love this scripture this is me this is me because you got to remember when I look at my life and see where I've had to come and grow up I've had to sit under a pastor I've had to sit under Ministries I've had to grow through deaconship and evangelism and now into pastorship and everywhere you see people pass on people move away and you've got to step right in behind and you've got to do the same things they did and guess what they didn't do it it was the god behind them that did it anden we look at our parents and we see how well they did we look at our Ministries and we see how well they did and we've got to step in We Are The Next Generation Church the older generation is nearly done here there is a generation that is not just rising up she's here and she's got to be able to say as he was with them so he is with me by personal experience by promise first but by personal experience second that God is behind us because we're walking in the promise of his word listen God did not say to Joshua Joshua you will be Flawless Joshua you will be perfect Joshua you won't have troubles Joshua you won't have struggles no why because God sees what's coming he knows that ain's going to cause them to fall he knows that Joshua's going to miss his leadership he knows that people are going to die under Joshua's watch but he's saying Joshua don't look at yourself look at me I'm the the differen maker I'm the mighty conqueror I'm the Victorious one it's because I'm with you that this is going to happen it's not on your shoulders it's on mine look at me amen God's telling Joshua here here's the effect of Moses message this is the effect we're in the time of the effect of the message not the preaching of the message that's already been done we're here in the time of the effect of the message it's claiming The Inheritance amen God knows what's coming God knows and so his message is about himself his unfailing word his promises his power his victory not Joshua he's telling Joshua look at me just look at me and you'll be okay what is Satan trying to do get you looking at the mirror instead of looking at Calvary amen get you looking at what you're doing rather than what the word says you're supposed to do Satan's hoping that we'll rely on ourselves rather than rest on the god that promised it that's what Satan's trying to do is get us looking at ourselves oh if we could only realize the greatness of the god that's moving with us church that's what's the difference maker in all of these things it's Christ with us it's Christ in Us by the Holy Ghost and that's what makes the difference in the situation not what I want or what I don't want not what I like or what I don't like not what I say or don't say but it's Christ in me the hope of glory that makes the difference in my life brother Braham said this he says but the greatest thing I found in Christian Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you can we say Amen this morning what's the result and his work is marvelous his work is marvelous it's his work from start to finish he's the author he's the finisher of our faith amen God said to Joshua I will be with you just like I was with Moses I'll lead you I'll guide you I'll give you the plans I'll give you the victory I'll destroy your enemies I'll undertake on your behalf I'll give you the full promise of the word just like I did with Moses nothing's going to stop here but watch what he says only be thou strong and very courageous it still takes courage to take God at his word that thou mayest observe catch it the hardness of the Gospel is in sticking with it the courage that's required is that you may observe to do according to all the law the courage is to stay with the word when every fiber of your logical being says Go a different way amen what when everything in you everything in this carnal nature is screaming do what everybody else does stay with the word look at what happens when they go to Jericho conventional wisdom would say you Siege it and you bring up battering weapons and you do this but here's the thing that had never destroyed Jericho Jericho had not been lost and so instead they have to walk around day after day after day quietly the courage is to do what God says to do and stick with it no matter what be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right-hander to the left that thou mayest Prosper withersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success not just success good success Godly success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest it's a promise but there's a requirement here God says just as I was with Moses I'll be with you but what does Joshua have to do Joshua has to believe like Moses Joshua has to seek like Moses Joshua has to have faith like Moses Joshua has to wait like Moses amen we forget all these things when we're looking at adoption as we're waiting for all this Authority and power but we forget the way to get there the character development the training the testing the proving the waiting the seeking there's a lot more of sitting quietly than there is thus sayeth the Lord because not God's not running around telling us to do all these things all the time but it's just Faithfully staying with his word until he gives you something and then you go do it but just day by day Joshua's got to act like Moses to get moses' results sometimes I think we're just sitting here I'm not saying this church I'm saying in general across the message we're secure in knowing our age and its message and we think that's what makes us go in a Rapture that is not what makes us go in a Rapture we're supposed to become the embodiment of the message not the intellectual carriers of the message amen the message is supposed to do something and so J God says to Joshua Joshua don't change anything that's coming out of your lips except the word let the word be the only thing you speak and he says to make sure that happens meditate day and night on that word stay with the word brother BR would say get back to the word get back to the word get back to the word why because when you do that you'll do what you read if you dwell on the word you'll become the word amen it'll produce the word in our life you'll be what God says you're supposed to be that's your good success is when you become the very thing that you're reading about amen that's when you have Victory why because you're centered on the word of God you're centered on the word of God that way the depth of the river in front of you doesn't matter matter that way when you come up to Jordan it doesn't matter how wide it looks how rough it looks how how how wide the edges are because of the floods the height of the walls of Jericho doesn't bother you when you come up to it why because you're in the middle of the word of God and you know you're in his will you know you're in his plan the size of the army or the size of the Giants facing us they don't bother us why because we're centered on his word Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against the why we're living by faith in the word of God that's given to us personally personally it's a day-by-day thing you know they're about to go into the land and we see that even the land the entrance into the land was a special moment for them but I want you to see how God reinforces what he's saying to Joshua here and to the people and I say that because we have no excuses anymore God makes his way so abundantly clear the scripture says that a man though a fool should not air therein the way of Holiness anybody ought to be able to read it and do it it's not that difficult but what happens is the word Cuts away all the smoke all the fog all the deception and it lays it be and it says do it or don't do it but watch how God tells them tells them to come into the land he says Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from from shaim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and and the priests the Levites burying it then you shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know that ye may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way here to before you've never been here before you've never done this before and so there's an order there's a way of doing this and he says don't run ahead don't get excited because the president pres of the Lord is here don't presume wait on what God has showed you to do let him lead the way follow the word and the word will lead you into the fullness of the promise the word goes before why because sometimes we got to grow up a little before we can get the promise sometimes we've got a little bit of something go before we can get the promise sometimes we've got to endure a while Abraham and Sarah had to endure a while but they were faithful to God speaking those that were not as if they were we've got to show our faith and when we show our faith we recognize that God's doing something in our lives how many times did Brother Braham say you didn't realize you had that much Faith why because somebody took God at his word and they didn't realize how much God had done in their life already God told Joshua in three days that's the time he says the word goes first that's the order and then he saysi separate the waters that's the how God gives him a time God gives him a way and God gives him the means and God's got to do that the waters aren't going to separate if I run up to the waters it's got to be the ministry with the word that goes first and as soon as their foot comes down the waters will separate if somebody presumed to try and cross Jordan because I've got the promise glory to God they'd have drowned they had to follow it in God's timing and God's season whatever we do Church the word has to go before us the word has to make the way that's our confidence because if God says it and God sets us into motion then God's going to make it happen in the time that of his choicing of his choosing amen why was Joshua Crossing Jordan because God told him to do it how did Joshua Cross Jordan the way God told him to do it when did he do it when God told him and it happened exactly the way that God said it would that's where we get our anointing we get our anointing from seeing the word for our day and then God putting it into action when we see these things happening around us amen that's what this Le toyan end time message is doing for us it's anointing us to fulfill the word and those men were anointed those priests were anointed to walk up so that as soon as they came up to the edge of that water soon as that foot started coming down the waters parted they're anointed to cross on dry land brother Bram says he says here it anoints us when we see we're living in the last days we see what's happening with Israel church that's God's time piece has always been God's time piece see he works with the Gentiles in generalities there's no set time but with the Jews he is very specific his times are are very specific with them you see all the prophecies with them are for a particular time right we have the 70 weeks of Daniel we have the the years of them being in in Babylon and these different things and it's all laid down to very strict timelines God works with Israel very quickly and we see where we're at today he says with anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days to find out that all these signs that we see taking place that spoke of in the scripture would take place in the last days all the way from Heaven to the political Powers the nature of the people come on as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah it is here it is here this month is a celebration of Sodom and Gomorrah church it's here political powers are behind it spiritual powers are behind it Financial powers are behind it everything is supporting Sodom and Gomorrah for this month he says the nature of the people the demoralization of the world and among the women and how they would do in the last days and how the men would do and how the churches would do how the nations would do and how God would do and we see it all laying right here on us he says oh it anoints what our faith why because we see what's happening there's a revelation of what's going on and it's quickening something inside of us to say hey there's got to be something happening to the bride if there's something happening out there as well he says it moves us out in the great Cycles it separates us from the other things of the world no matter how little we are how much a minority we are how much we're laughed at or made fun of it doesn't make a bit of difference that's all he says why we see it he says there is something within us we are predestinated to see this hour and there's nothing going to stop us from seeing it let me read that again we are predestinated to see this hour and there's nothing going to stop us from seeing it church that's the anchor of our souls is that he said we'd be there he said we'd see it he said we'd be a part of it he says amen here God has spoken it's already happened we see it oh how we thank God for this oh then it brings out your faith when we see all these things happening here there's things that seem so obvious to us today church and you try and talk to another Christian about it and they don't have a clue what you're talking about I was showing my wife something there yesterday and there's um there's this guy he's got a PhD in Theology and he's got this thing called real real uh real Bible Believers on YouTube and so I I watched something he said there and he said you know the gospel is different came differently to the Jews than it did to the Gentiles he says the apostles were one way but Paul was completely different from the apostles he had a completely different type of ministry and this and that the other thing and I'm sitting there saying are you even reading your Bible Paul spoke in tongues Paul had signs and wonders Paul healed the sick Paul cast out demons Paul was led by the Holy Spirit and Paul preached the word he was the 12th Apostle he was literally exactly like all the rest of them and yet he's sitting there saying Paul was completely different from the rest of them but in action and word and In Deed everything Paul did was just like the rest of them why because he's blinded he's blinded he'll say things that you need one all you need is one scripture to disprove him wrong and he can't see it in all of his phds of theology why he doesn't want to see it he's blinded by it he can't see it but we see it we see what's going on and it's only God's grace it is only God's grace it is not our intellect that's brought us here it is only God's grace cuz he put a seed in inside of us to catch it that's the only thing it's the only thing that ought to keep our pride in check that's for sure but I want to take us to Joshua 10 as we start to close this morning as we're speaking on Authority by position I want you to see what it looks like when Revelation strikes about who you are and what you're doing on this Earth and we know that Joshua has these five kings that unite against him and he's facing a big army because they're trying to break Israel in one Fell Swoop they want one battle get it done with and push the Israelites back and so Joshua gathers all the Warriors and he goes to meet but I want you to see what God says to Joshua here says and the Lord said unto Joshua fear them not but I want you to see why for I have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before Thee I want you to see the tenses there fear not why because I have past tense delivered them into your hand and then he jumps to the Future there shall not a man of them stand before thee it's a finished work in God's eyes that's why you don't have to fear it's a finished work but he says now when you get into the battle you're going to win not a single one of them is going to be able to stand before you and defeat you the battle is ahead the work is already done that's the challenge for the Believers to see it through God's eyes from eternity it's a finished work he's saying Joshua it's already done buddy just go in there and fight nothing's going to beat you he says and the Lord discomforted them before Israel and slew them with a great Slaughter of gibian and chased them all the way down that goes up to bethor and smot them to ezeka and under Mak and it came to pass as they fled from before Israel so Israel fights and they get the moving and we the going down to bethon that the Lord cast down great stones from Heaven upon them unto ASA and there and they died and there were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword what did Paul say if God be for us who can be against us there they're fighting nobody can stand before them but it has and killed them all and so God starts sending down these massive hailstones and more are killed by the hailstones from God's hands than are killed by the swords held by the people he says then spake Joshua unto the Lord in the day which the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel Church catch this Joshua does not go into the prayer closet he doesn't go in and he doesn't he doesn't say now Lord Lord we need some help here Lord and I don't want no no in the the sight of Israel he stands up publicly and he says son stand thou still upon gibian and thou moon in the valley of aelon Joshua knew he was on the Lord's business and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies in other words until the job was done is this not written in the book of jasher so the sun Stood Still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day I can't imagine the mathematics God had to do to make that work but we get a bit of an idea it says there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel God says I'll do it once I'm never doing that again but you know we can go back because we have the science now to go back and we can literally go back back and spin all the things around in this earth and we know all the orbits and all the paths and and how long it takes these things to spin around and they have gone back and they have shown that we're missing time and if you add up all the times that God stopped things in the Bible it adds up perfectly you know they can go back and they can literally come up with that with the the uh Eclipse that happened over Calvary they can do all of these things with science now to go back and showed that it actually happened God says it happened once it'll never happen again but that man knew where he stood see what happened is Joshua learned from Moses Moses hesitation Moses taught it to Joshua Joshua when God tells you to do something all of Heaven is at your back we're going to talk about that a little bit in a in a couple of services Lord willing all of Heaven is at your back when you're walking in his word amen listen to this he says Joshua was anointed to to take the land for God and for his people the day was short he needed more time for the job that he was anointed and commissioned to do anointed and commissioned Joshua a man he was anointed God told him as I was with Moses I'll be with you amen that land I'm going to give it to them and I want you to go over there and clean out the amalekites and all the others the Philistines the parasites perizzites and all the different ones clean them out I'm with you no man will stand before you all the days of your life no man can bother you go on in there anointed and commission Church what's your anointing today and what's your commission because if you have an anointing you have a commission then you've got orders what are your orders what are your orders do we have orders are we just walking around listen Joshua drew the sword and said follow me and he got over there and here he was fighting and what was it he routed the enemy there were little bunches here and little bunches there when night came they would all get together and Garrison together and come with a big Force against him and the sun was going down he needed more light the sun was going down he didn't fall on his knees and say Lord God what shall I do what shall I do he says he spoke he had a need he had a need based on his commission based on his orders it wasn't his choice it was God's command to him to go do this and so all he's doing is fulfilling God's command it's not it's a nice have it's not a want to have it's a I need this to finish the job Lord he said Son stand still he didn't cry to nothing he commanded son stand still I've got a need of this I'm the servant of the Lord anointed for this job and I've got a need stand still and don't you shine and moon you hang where you're at till he fought the Battle through and whipped the whole thing down and the son obeyed him see God keeps training God keeps building up and Joshua doesn't make the mistake of Moses he doesn't have a why cry speak moment he speaks because the need is there the whole plan is laid in front of him and he says listen God told me to do it I'm anointed for it I'm just going to do it and he spoke and I don't know where that came from church I don't know what kind of a revelation you need to make the Sun and the Moon stand still but whatever it was that was the anointing that was on Joshua I don't believe joshu came up with this on his own that's what the anointing is about is that you will speak according to the anointing and I believe God wanted him to do it and it was a Vindication that God was with Jo Joshua in a very very special way Joshua knows when God sends you speak the word and God will back it up if you have a need you ask for it God will back it up he says no crying out he spoke to the sun said you stand still Sun hang there Moon you stay where you're at he didn't cry out Lord no what can I do give me some more sunlight he had need of sunlight so he commanded it and the son obeyed him Oh my he commanded the son to stand still watch how we continue now he says Samson anointed raised up ordained of God given a gift of power was ordained to destroy the nation of the Philistines he was ordained born on the Earth anointed of God to destroy the Philistines and one day they caught him out in the field without a sword and without a spear and a thousand of those armored Philistines ran upon him at one time did he get down and say oh Lord I'm waiting for a vision oh Lord what must I do direct me now what to do he said he knew he had a need he found nothing but an old Jawbone of a mule and he beat down a thousand Philistines amen what is that in your hand what is that in your hand just take it and use it he says he never cried to God he used his anointed gift see see when you read in the scriptures we all tend to think of you know Samson as somebody that looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger you know big bodybuilder massive bulging muscles just bigger than everybody that is not what the scripture says about Samson the scripture says and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Samson in other words and the Lord anointed Samson and that's when Samson did amazing things here's the thing it's no different for us we we may not be out there lifting up Gates and killing a thousand Philistines but the scripture says one of you shall chase a thousand amen there are Supernatural battles that are going on here and it's just little people anointed the difference is the anointing amen Samson was only strong when he was anointed that's the only time he had strength Church without the Holy Spirit we're weak and everything we do will not Prosper not Prosper according to God's way of doing things it might have an effect but it won't have a Godly effect he says he knew that he was sent for the job he knew he was born for that he knew he was anointed with a gift and he beat down a thousand Philistines he didn't cry to God why because God ordained him and Vindicated him that he was by other things that he had done see Samson had a lifetime of this already so what happens is eventually he doesn't have to say Lord is this my job because every time he's doing this job God is with them church if God is with you in what you're doing then why are are we questioning whether he's with us when we do it the next day he has proven himself now time and time again experience by experience you business owners he's proving himself you Brothers in your jobs he's proving himself I'm with you I'll take care of you so why do we worry why do we fret mothers fathers whatever it is young people if he's with you he's with you amen he doesn't go in come and go and come and go he's committed himself to his word and there's a word seat inside of us that he's committed to bring it out into full maturity he says he was a Vindicated anointed servant of God to do what destroy the Philistines and he did it no matter what the circumstances were he did it he never asked nothing that was his job and God was dealing through him he says he picked up that mulebone and got to beating Philistines you know we look at these things and I kind of had a giggle when I was going through this because we can kind of get in this you know I'm a mighty warrior like Samson and what do we want to do we want to meet force with Force right we want to go in and whatever they do we can do it better and more and greater and what we do is better than theirs and that's why we win you know we're a proud line of Warriors we're the coffee Warriors we're the klette Warriors Josh the ancient tribe of the columbos the great lion Killers you know no but see we can get caught up in this idea that I've got to go out there and I've just got to beat The Living Daylights out of whatever comes my way come on we have to meet force with Force but what is our weapon church it's the word of God quickened by the spirit and let me ask you when the word defeated you how did it do it did it come in and just is that what it did or did love did love reach down and call your name call you higher reach out a hand and completely and totally conquer self see we want to go out there and we want to destroy but remember it's about souls it's not about winning it's about souls amen yes the word convicts but it does not condemn Force condemns love convicts because it gives you a way out Satan wants you to condemn people Satan wants you to beat people up with what you know with your Revelation with your position that is not the work of God Amen brother Brandon remember he has two incidences where he deals with the bull and he deals with the Hornets remember the bull he's going to pray for somebody he walks into the field he disturbs it it's a bull that's already killed somebody and then the Hornets he's doing the same thing he's about the father's business he's going to pray and he disturbs them both of course the bull wants to charge and kill him and the Hornets start swirling around him and you know what brother brandham says he conquered them with he said he said this may sound funny this may Str sound strange you may not believe me he says I loved them and he said he apologized to them he said I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you I didn't mean to get in your way but I'm about the father's business so go back to where you were and they went back brother ramam said when he did that the atmosphere changed see we're not going to take this carve up theologians that never got anybody anywhere but love will change them scripture says by your love one for another that's how all my men that's how men will know you're my disciples the way you can treat a person that doesn't sound very spiritual but listen if what's in this doesn't come live in this then it's not spiritual in the first place because the the real spirituality will come out inside of our day-to-day lives amen it's not by might it's by the power of love that we see these things happen humanly speaking we want to flare up they come with a sword we come with a bigger sword they come with a gun we come with a bigger gun whatever it is we come with a bigger heavier stronger but that's not the way God works our strength is not the same as theirs and our answer is not the same as theirs our weapons are not the same as theirs remember what Paul said as we start to close for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our wherefor Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ people notice when we respond differently church people notice when we curb our tongues people notice when we have a different attitude or reaction than they would have and they notice it most when they know that you have a right to respond in a certain way and you lay it aside why because you're interested in Souls not in self-preservation amen pride is what causes these things to lift up if we're If we're honest pride is what causes us to flare up and humility is what causes us to put our lives aside for the sake of their soul where the mystery of God being revealed in this last age amen he's expecting more of us our battles show what kingdom we're fighting for amen going to close with a quote the musicians can come Jesus said himself we can all Stand Together Jesus said himself he that overcometh I will give him the Morning Star the Bible said that what is an overcomer an overcomer is one that's overcome the world overcome self and overcome Pride I'll make him the Morning Star what does it do I'll shine him up and set him up there that I by my oncoming power will reflect my own presence in the darkness he that overcomes will I give the Morning Star what's the Morning Star set there to reflect the sun coming he says what is the Morning Star it's the sun shining against it reflecting the presence of the coming of the sun it's the brightest thing in heaven he says the brightest thing in heaven ought to be today and is today the minister or the Christian or the Spirit-filled man that's so filled with the Holy Spirit till he's forsaken the world and everything and God is reflecting his light coming through him warning the world that the approaching s o n is at hand amen you're a written epistle seen and read of all men you're the reflection of Christ in this day because he's down personally by his Spirit but now he's coming down to gather up a bride into him and before she goes she has to be revealed as him what is it it's the bride coming of Christ it's the mystery that Paul said was hidden from the very Ages was us and Christ in US revealing the final portion of the final word to this generation then he moves on to the Jews Authority by position what do we use it for the king's business the father's business not for self-gratification notice we don't vindicate ourselves he vindicates us and he only vindicates a people that can seek and find his will and stay in his word that's what he's looking for it's simple people are wanting to push people are wanting to make things happen you can't make it happen all you can do is stay faithful with this and then God will reach out and he'll touch you here and he'll touch this one here and he'll touch this one here and it's just a little bit of God here and a little bit there but when you put it all together you see the great revealing of Christ and his people amen God hidden and revealed in Simplicity sons and daughters that have stayed with his word until he places them and gives them his word so that they'll speak and he'll back it up amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord truly as the song says Lord all we want to see is Jesus lord to reflect him Lord to see his goodness in our lives Lord to know that we're called and placed Lord and we're about your business and Lord I pray that you'd help us Lord so much as I was studying this came back to Pride Lord getting caught up in ourselves Lord but if we could just humble ourselves to your word Lord stay tight to you Lord if we can rest on you if we can seek you Lord and find you Lord then it takes care of all the doubts and the fears and the YMS Lord takes care of Pride it takes care of our own inclinations Heavenly Father Lord help us to seek you day by day I pray Lord help us to seek your work your will your purpose for us Lord and to see you in the little things that we do Lord not to diminish those little things Lord not to despise the day of little things Lord but to understand that you're in the little things and they turn into great big things Lord will you just speak into our lives now I pray Lord give us your leadership give us your wisdom Lord give us patience and grace and mercy for those around us Lord help us to look to you always as the author and finisher of our faith we pray Lord help us to stay faithful Lord help us to stay in the battle Lord if we've laid down our weapons Lord if we've gotten tired Lord if we've got despondent Lord if we've gotten worn out Lord maybe we've gotten jaded or hurt Lord I pray you help us to pick up the sword again and say Lord put me on the front lines Lord Place us back in the battle we pray Lord For Your Glory we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
