hallelujah thank God he delivers again amen thank you Jesus Oh My how hopeless we be without such a truth amen Lord St John 31 trust you enjoyed the word last nighten I trust it was a help to you and Heard lots of wonderful comments from different folks and I'm so happy to hearing St John 3 ver1 I want to speak to you tonight on how do I receive the Holy Ghost amen amen how do I receive the Holy Ghost now you might say I've already got it well that's great you're going to find out how you you got it then St John 3: 1 amen let's start here at Jesus's first Doctrine there was a man of the Pharisees named n named Nicodemus excuse me a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God what a bunch of slimy hypocrites H do you hear me amen what a bunch of slimy Hypocrites amen these people knew he was a teacher come from God and yet they were hiding in the corners they wasn't publicly declaring who he was slimy Hypocrites it's okay say Amen it ain't going to hurt you yeah right that's exactly what they were to know to do something like that friends is nothing but sin in the presence of God it's all it is the eyes of God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him yes Jesus answered and said unto him well Nicodemus you're right now I'm glad you all finally getting it uh verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen what a strange answer yes of all the things he could have said to him why that because it was the most needful answer for what Nicodemus was saying in order for him to do the things he was doing it took the spirit of God to do it through Jesus because remember Jesus as a man could do nothing in himself but what the father saw him do right so it took this spiritual something now Jesus is pointing Nicodemus right to the source as it were of what really makes a Christian a Christian what makes a Believer a Believer he didn't start from the outside realm and Reformation he didn't start in the spiritual realm and deal with psychology and all that he went right to the root of the problem right to the heart amen cuz that's where the real problem was at amen right CU remember Jesus looks at many of these people and he said on the outside you've got it right on the outside I can't disagree with your life you're white on the outside but on the inside full of Dead Man's Bones so there was a deeper part of this that was being missed Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit amen Marvel not that I say unto thee ye must be born again amen amen I don't mind telling you friends if Nicodemus wasn't the right kind of man at the point when Jesus said that a man had to be born again and he got the idea for from Jesus this Prophet that said a man had to be born twice that's probably about the time Nicodemus sought him a website builder and put up a whole website against Jesus teaching that a man had to be born a second time there's no scripture for it there's no scripture for it you'll never find anywhere in the Bible that the words in the Old Testament born again was ever used before the only thing you'll find new spirit I'll put my spirit he talks about all of these great things but there's no word for btim one word for word that says anything about bornn again where in the world did Jesus get this from you know how strange it must have sound to them about like the message does to many people today amen amen right you hear Brother talking about a cloud an angel of the Lord do you hear I'm talking about all these great signs and wonders and Supernatural things he said let's go to the Garden of Eden he said I imagine there's Eve standing there with her blonde hair and her blue eyes you understand what happens to people if they're non-spiritual they just run off a tangent with something not realizing that many times men of God will dra will draw things from the Bible and put together a picture that's not necessarily on the lines but sometimes in between the lines well praise the Lord got yall thinking tonight that's good that's good amen let me read to you from a message called the unfail unfailing realities of the Living God this is preached June of 1960 and here we are in June of 2017 as is just as pertinent today the Holy Spirit comes today in like manner to present God to man but man wants to go to church it drowns his thinking he cannot fathom it we must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception amen amen God is known by the new birth amen by the Holy Ghost not by any other way amen amen let's pray together over the word Heavenly Father we thank thank you Father for the great precious scripture that lays before us we are so grateful for the Bible Lord and father we know your word is a lamp under our feet that as we go through a dark lady OA there's a light that shines for the people of God it illuminates our pathway that we can know what is the end result of a child of God thank you Lord as he talked about in the book of Psalm how David would say I've considered man he's like a tree like the flower of grass said Peter Lord truly this life as we live it is a vapor God what we're trying to get a hold of is eternal life not for the purpose of blessing ourself but because we want to live and learn of you for the rest of our entire creative Life As We Live it here eternally with you actually pise Lord we want to hear from your great mouth tonight Lord and from your great heart and great mind and we want to sit at your feet that you will come and break your bread of life around us Lord that we can feed on on the word of God that our souls can be fed and fat Hallelujah in the presence of almighty God we just want to thank you now for all that's been accomplished thus far and all of the worship all the songs and every effort that's went forth thank you for it Lord and as we come to this important part of the service we pray that you'll be with us Lord and speak to us now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you you may be seated the intellectual mind has no ability to absorb spiritual things that which is spiritual is of spiritual that which is of carnal is of carnal for people to talk about the Holy Ghost and what the Holy Ghost truly is we've got to get down to what the Bible says the Holy Ghost is first of all the Holy Ghost is not a Doctrine the Holy Ghost is not a teaching the Holy Ghost GH is not a revelation so much as the Holy Ghost is a person amen and the person of the Holy Ghost Jesus himself is the one that we receive into our hearts when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes it comes by Revelation yes it comes by illumination of the word but it's greater than just being able to see the Holy Ghost uh I see it's right it's deeper than that it's actually being able to receive the person of God Into Your Heart by baptism of the Holy Spirit by him actually a little piece of God entering inside the human soul and making that person as a Christ in you the hope of glory type person and this great Holy Ghost is something that really has been downplayed around the ranks of the message because frankly many of the people just don't understand it and we've heard the term throw it around so much that people have attributed their own mindset to what they think it is and have created almost more confusion than what really needs to be created when it's the answer is really simple laying right in the word of God the Holy Ghost is many many things but first it is a person it is God himself remember when Paul meets Jesus on the road to Damascus he meets the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost said I am Jesus so it's not a third person of the Trinity it's not a second person it's not a first person it is the person of God so God himself as he unfolds himself to us the revelation of who he is is not even so much a revelation of oh I see it this is where we have to be careful with the term Revelation because many times we think oh I I see it and that that's what makes it h it's more than that a person can see certain things and certain things even be revealed to a certain degree to them but what we are talking about is when God himself moves into the human heart and changes the person's thoughts changes their desires changes their opinions changes their attitudes and swings their body subject to the word of God because that's what the Holy Ghost is supposed to do so it's actually a piece of God that's living on the inside of you now I hope you realize when when the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost and he sat as licks of fire on each of them it was that God as we say down south bursted himself apart or he busted himself apart in many different pieces first in 120 Parts upon the disciples and then to 3,000 as they heard the word preach their hearts were pricked and he began spreading spreading spreading then the prophet of God said that when we come together like this he said then if you got to lick and you got to lick and you got to lick and you got to lick and y'all got to lick and this one's got to lick and that one's got to lick you're bringing a portion of the pillar of fire back together when you come into the house of God that's one reason coming to church is so important so that you can draw as we say from one another's licks of fire CU you'll have strengths and you'll have something in you that maybe I wouldn't have in me and I would have things that maybe you wouldn't and we can draw one from another strength to go on in the journey now as we read here what Jesus said about this born again I challenge you sometime to go back in the Old Testament and try to find a Verbatim scripture that talks about born again now I don't mean mean that you can say oh this is where he was taught no I mean the words born again you're never going to find Moses or any of them ever talking about a second birth or any of these type of things now in a shadow form they would speak about the change coming into a heart or the change coming to man or that God would take away the Stony heart give him a heart of you can find all of that but to use the term born again you'll never really find it in the Old Testament just that way so Jesus was actually if you can understand this he was revealing a mystery that laid under the seventh seal cuz remember for the seven seal can be found all the way back in the Book of Genesis and it can be revealed all the way down remember the seven seal reveals in a three-fold manner first Christ coming to redeem the bride then back with the bride and the second coming then of course the third fold in Revelation 19 he unfolds in a three-fold manner but when you begin to realize that Redemption and the and the the opening of that part of the seal actually began in the Book of Genesis when man fell from Grace then God began to slowly in a shadow form he began to reveal little Mysteries and things and lay symbols and types all through the Old Testament leading up to Redemption remember brother man said in the Masterpiece he said in the Masterpiece as he went over there and saw the statue of David he said the pedestal had four corners and the feet and the body and so forth built up till it came came to the head and he said so did God do the same in the Old Testament he said that the pedestals was Joseph and Isaac and Jacob and so forth for Perfection and Grace in that pedestal then he built the body through the prophets and then Jesus Christ himself was The Headstone of the Old Testament setting down now all of that Paul said spoke to something coming in the future but it was not a revelation and it wasn't made known until Jesus begins to break to Nicodemus here what part of that great mystery was it was the mystery of the new birth and remember the new birth was something that was hidden in a shadow all the way from the book of Genesis when you watch the lamb being slain for the pain over the sins of Adam and Eve it was speaking to a time that God hallelujah would cover over the person's sin that they could be not just covered over but be eradicated all together Amen to be divorced from sin all together and to be just IFI as though a man or woman never done it in the first place so all of that was being spoke of up to the time that the Lord Jesus begins to break this mystery it was truly a portion of the mystery of redemption that laid under this seven seal now not fully known to man because it wasn't until our age that all of this was fully made known of what it really was of what Jesus was speaking of so there'd be many of them that would probe at it down through the seven Church ages they all knew what Jesus said about receiving the Holy Ghost and being born again and having the substance of Christ inside of them but to truly understand what it meant and how that a person would receive the Holy Ghost then it was something that was reserved under the very last day that then we could fully comprehend how Christ could be in the human heart and yet here you are standing on Earth with all of your problems all of your circumstances all of your issues and yet Christ I mean the Lord Jesus Christ himself living inside that human heart of yours it's almost more than a person can fathom and even though under the ignorance of the ages and under the permittable parts that God gave Luther would smoke a pipe we was laughing today about Germans and their beer well here here here here Luther's a he's a German Beer Drinker but yet but there with the Holy Ghost in his heart because God would wink at their ignorances of not knowing what was full truth but then coming on with with Wesley and then to Pentecost and then all the way to this age the Holy Ghost would take on many theological uh parts to it and people would look at the Holy Ghost as though maybe it was a gift or maybe a supernatural something wle would say it's a a style of living a manner of living a Methodist a method that you live that's the Holy Ghost but then Here Comes brother Brandon all the way down here in the last day and points all the way back to the beginning of when when the Holy Ghost was first coming and said it was not the way you live it's not the way you act or don't act it's not whether you got faith or don't Faith it's that if the Holy Ghost enters into a person's heart it's because God himself had predestinated before the foundation of the world that that person was a part of him before the foundation was ever laid of this Earth before the stars were ever hung they were a germ seed in the mind of God before the foundation of the world so the Holy Ghost isn't just whenever you feel a chill run down your back it's more than that it's you being a part of Christ Hallelujah you being a germ seed like my children was in me when I was 16 running up and down and and and and and all the things I did as a boy and and this and that laughing and playing and what more my children were already Amen on the inside of me they were part of my life they were a part of my character they was a part of my life stream and so is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen if she's a Christian tonight she was in God her father before the foundation of the world how did I receive the holy ghost first of all my name had to be on the Lamb's Book of Life amen because as we preached last year you remember about the book of redemption and how that in order for a person to receive the inheritance of the Holy Ghost you had to have a title deed first you had to have that title deed you had to have your name on the title deed of redemption this is one reason that when Jesus breaks this about the New Birth it is a part of the mystery of those seals that's going to be revealed as we go down through this now now watch as brother R says here again Watch he said a man he said wants to go to church he said God wants to present man to God and God wants to present man to himself but he wants to go to church he said what we must learn is that God is not known by intellectual conception God is known by the New Birth by the Holy Ghost Jesus plainly quoted no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost if you've never received the Holy Ghost listen to this if you've never received the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is Christ amen cuz that's the only way that he reveals himself that's right now listen to me carefully let me let me let me let me slow down just a moment because I'm preaching awful fast and you're listening awful slow I can tell but I I want to just just back off just a moment let me get this thought across to you when somebody talks about Christ revealing thems and Christ uh himself rather and Christ revealing himself to them if that individual has not been born again and has not received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not a spiritual Revelation that they're getting but it's actually an intellectual Revelation amen now you say that sounds strange but it it's what brother Brenham said right here the only way he can reveal himself is through the Holy Ghost amen so if a person doesn't receive the Holy Ghost then there's no Revelation that can accompany what they got right CU that's the only way God reveals himself amen or you say well I'll study and God will show me and he'll open up if you haven't received the Holy Ghost you got to go step one before you can go step two remember last night well this we're right on the next part of this after a man comes from Calvary and comes into this new birth part he must receive she must receive the Holy Ghost before that they can move into the deeper Revelations of God I I I think what we've got in our mind we got it all mixed up that God reveals a bunch of things then we get to Holy Ghost that's backwards that's right a man must be born again first before God can never reveal to him spiritual revelation of who he is amen he amen that's exactly right now acts 238 said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost can anybody find in that formula once you learn the seals once you understand the godhead once you understand then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost no last I checked the formula was repent be baptized in Jesus Christ's name you shall receive amen amen it's okay to Blink at me it ain't going to hurt you that's the formula remember brother BR said the sickness in the human age was the sickness in the soul of being a sinner by birth and he said Dr Simon Peter amen he gave the prescription or the formula for how man could get sin out of his heart so first you receive the Holy Ghost amen Second Great Revelations of God come amen but you say God revealed a lot of things to me before I got the Holy Ghost it might have been intellectual Revelation but we're talking about spiritual revelation because many people can see things a lot of people can see serpent seed and they can understand the godhead and you know in one place in the church age book I believe it was brother M said that it doesn't even take a revelation for a man to see the water baptism that's just a matter of reading it you can read it right down and be baptized in the name of and unless you just don't know maybe how how that that would look or how how to understand unless your mind just don't work in a certain way it's really quite simple to see that baptism entitles is not what Jesus said amen that's right amen but God revealed this God revealed this then I got to Holy Ghost that's contrary to the program of God that's right that's right Lord y'all are quiet on me woo you are quiet you say you're listening uhhuh sure that's a nice excuse but I know what it is you're getting tense cuz I'm getting close to home amen amen uhhuh Lord makes you start thinking about how you got the Holy Ghost don't it glad you come to church tonight that's what this is all about it's okay to be a little uncomfortable I want you to be a little uncomfortable cuz that way I can stir you up and tell you what's right now watch she said if you've never received the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is Christ you want to take the Bible on it no man can call Jesus the Christ but by the Holy Ghost you can't even identify him as the Lord Jesus except by the Holy Ghost amen you say oh amen now brother Ben Peter uhhuh and what Jesus say after that came to him Peter after you're converted strengthen your brethren God revealed it to the man's mind it was an intellect actual Revelation that God made known to him and he held on to that all the way through because he was a predestinated seed predestinated seed will hold on to everything that's truth because that's what they are amen but we're talking about the difference of God making a revelation known through the intellectual mind revealing it to the intellectual mind and a man receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and passing from Death under life amen do you understand that's the way God brings you into this revelation amen people say well glory to God I I I I I I got a hold of the Altar and I I SC the formula is repent be baptized in Jesus Christ's name you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's no altar call in that there's no jumping or shouting in that the formula is simple repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen it doesn't get any simpler than that and I'm afraid what we've done around the message is we've tried to cookie cut what we believe that formula is supposed to look like that's and friends I believe with all my heart if we just leave it alone and just let it be what it's supposed to be come on don't get quiet on me just let it be what God said it's supposed to be then we don't have to try to figure out uh well so and so jumped So High when they got it and so and so cried and so and so rolled in the floor the bottom line is so and so and so and so and so and so they repented they were baptized in Jesus name they receive the Holy Ghost all that other is just additional it's like molasses on your burger or your biscuit not your burger your biscuit what you call that thing today what I eat to to yeah on your towel that's exactly what it is all the rest of it is just additional things that God places in there the formula is repent and be back I believe sincerely that one reason when people come up front asking God to move or raise their hand in the service asking God to move on their heart to give them true conversion I sincerely believe most of the time they don't even know what they're doing and remember in the Holy Ghost Series in 1959 when brother B goes to straighten out the on the Holy Ghost the one of the first things he tells us is that you cannot receive it if you don't know what it is you're going to receive and he said how are you going to know what you got and when you get it if you don't know what it's all about he said that's why I want to take these services and try to expound to you on what it really is then he tells us the Holy Ghost came to bring power and authority and joy and all of these great things but the the Holy Ghost himself is a person that enters Into the Heart of an elected man or woman and from that new birth in their heart then all of these great things begin to Blossom out amen absolutely because it's a seed that's inside your soul the moment you took the Breath of Life you want scripture for that first Peter he talks about being born again of of Incorruptible seed as you were born of a corruptible seed you're born again corrupt oh you see I get that when uh the word just falls out there while it's preaching that ain't what brother B said brother bam said in thanking man's filer he said that there was a seed already on the inside of you he said in in a future home he tells us that that little seed was trying to declare itself God rich and mercy on page six he said there was a seed of life already on the inside of you when you was crawling around on the floor as a baby in communion the very last message brother R said there was two William Brams in me he said one catered to the the world he said but there was another part that catered to God amen amen he said what was it that life that was on the inside laying dormant waiting for the light of God to cross it he said that's the reason the woman at the well when she saw Jesus and recognized right quick Thou Art the Messiah sir I perceive you're a prophet brother man said what was it that life was already laying there he said on the inside of her and she could recognize amen oh thank you Jesus she could recognize because the life was already there people are waiting on it to fall waiting on it to this waiting on it that is a simple way to look at it if the seed is there you'll repent you'll be baptized you'll receive the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen it's not much more complicated than that am people try oh believe the message and believe the prophet and believe this and believe repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Amen brother and then after that God can reveal to you whatever he wants to reveal to you amen I wish people would get this first before they moved on to the next part exactly amen forgive me but I think that's one of the biggest problems our churches have had for the last 30 years is we've been so intellectual and deep and trying to dig into the deep things of God and people sitting around in the congregation not even born again amen if I preach to you the revelation of the hour and you don't have the Holy Ghost according to the Bible not brother Brown the Bible you don't even understand what I'm talking about amen amen cuz until you're born again God himself can't even reveal to you what I'm saying he will not cross his formula he has to stay with what he taught and if he done it that way one time he has to do it that way forever more this is the reason I believe our churches are in desperate need of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen hang on everybody preachers and all amen amen cuz there's a lot of preachers in the the platform and don't even know what the Holy Ghost looks like that's exactly right because they came in they felt the Holy Ghost move they saw signs and wonders they got a hold of some Revelations whole I must have her glory to God that must be it repent be baptized and then you shall receive the gift if they skip that formula I don't care how good they feel or how deep they think they are they're still a sinner according to brother brandom cuz you are not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost amen well I had plenty of friends I think I'm making a few enemies right now hope y'all don't hate me after this one tonight you're not converted brother says until you receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said after Peter had been saved and Sanctified he was given power to cast out unclean spirits and even preach the gospel that's right that's right I'm reading what brother B said now Jesus plainly told him he was not converted till he received the Holy Ghost so that's the main thing go to Calvary die receive the Holy Ghost then move on to deep things am I must have something on my face again some of that molasses from that tout y'all are looking at me like you don't know what I'm saying you see why we get a little bit taken back by this this is the kind of preaching you just don't hear around the ranks of the message anymore people just don't want to preach this way anymore it's too simple it's too easy go well I I I hate to hurt people's feelings and make them feel like they wasn't saved so I guess you'd rather hurt their feelings when they found out they wound up in hell I'd rather you be hurt now praise the Lord I'd rather you be offended now that Oh my he told it shook me I'd rather shake you now then find out later on like that like that girl that uh I wouldn't let my cow have that girl when brother said she was dying in the hour of death and said go get that girl and then looked at the preacher and said you deceiver a man I'm on my way to Hell In A J fault so I would much rather tell you the truth now and say what's right now and you get the idea but here's the problem is many times the ranks of this message they they they have a spiritual agenda if you will and their agenda is as they say preach the Revelation but if the people don't enter into the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Revelation cannot come no matter what they preach amen but you say brother Ben we preach the Revelation so the Holy Ghost can come I I'll give you a little credit there but you have to understand that when the message is preached to a person there must be first the recognition that they're a sinner amen the problem we have with with many of the uh reformations as I'll say around the message is that many of them will come in still a sinner not see the Holy Ghost they'll hear certain things preached in the congregation and they'll sympathize or they'll go along with it or it'll seem reasonable to them and they'll go but they've never really sat and recognized I am a sinner and I need a savior amen cuz listen to me close unless you come to that spot you're not ready to move on to the next thing cuz in order to receive the Holy Ghost and be saved you need to realize you're lost first amen the Lord I wonder friends how many people sitting around this message have had a silver spoon stuck in their mouth and they don't even realize they're lost yet M they've lived clean they've lived good oh you say it's impossible no it's not anybody can keep habits anybody that's afraid of Hell or anybody that doesn't want to go to a bad place or whatever they can they can train themsel to to be religious and to be righteous and and to act spiritual every Catholic priest on the street teaches you that every nun in the Convent will show you that a man or woman can train their minds to live in a religious manner but the question is brother sister have you recognize I am a sinner and I need my savior Jesus cuz if you don't recognize that you don't even have the first stage of the thing in the [Applause] beginning well I felt a religious feeling but that's not recognizing you're a sinner I felt this I felt that I I can quote the me but did you recognize you were a sinner and need a savior cuz if if you don't do that then all it is is just joining church and playing church that's right Lord y'all was shouting with me last night woo maybe I just go in the office come back out and change my text all together now see this gets a little closer to home that's where I want it amen now you'll notice brother B again said no man is truly converted until he's been changed died to himself and the Holy Spirit has control of that person so again what is the Holy Ghost given for he said now I want to show you after a while that just those who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that Rapture amen so a man or woman cannot even go into the Rapture until they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but I believe the message Holy Ghost I believe the prophet but holy ghost that's what we're talking about amen the the key element of the thing is have you been born again now I'm going to show you after a while by God's grace how this comes to us through preaching but I I got to get this in first so we can see this part before we go on because what what I'm afraid that we're going to find out that as we go on in time is that people will come and with their intellectual mind they'll be able to grasp a hold of spiritual things and yet in a certain way they almost grieve their soul away from them that is telling them that they're not saved that they're not right with God and by a religious feeling or a religious belief they're grieving their soul away from them and you can sit there and preach in the congregation they need to get right with God the hour is approaching of the rapture we need to buckle down and they'll sit there and say brother Ben I'm fine there's nothing wrong with me they don't even move when you ask them to move I was in a service just the other night and I asked the people after preaching on the calvary like I did last night I asked I asked some of the people how many of you sitting in here tonight feel like you need a little bit more of this in your life and there was a certain Minister standing there been a preacher for over 40 years and he was one of the last didn't even raise his hand didn't even make a gesture and I thought oh God if that does not speak to the hour that we're living in where brother brandham said there'll be souls in prison they'll be eternally lost and no matter what you preach to them they're sitting there with a deaf ear their soul grieved away from them not an ounce of conviction and they don't even recognize that the hours passed they crossed the line between mercy and judgment there's no way to get back and there you are preaching the word to them looking him right in the face amen amen people Harden their Spirits amen because whenever they get that religious feeling they think oh I've gone far enough remember in Hebrews 6 the Bible even said that they can taste of the powers of the world to come amen and yet they can turn around and fall right away from the truth crucifying the Bible said Jesus putting him to an open shame oh my Lord remember told you last night message people will crucify the effects of the Gospel that's what we're hearing tonight now this is the reason why we have to be careful not to drown our conviction in religious feeling but this is where we need to call to genuine honesty you know what I'd love to see in this church tonight if there was even one centner right here in this place I would love to see such an atmosphere of conviction come into this building to where that the soul begin speaking to that person and they realize I'm lost I'm on my way to hell I don't care if you've been serving God a hundred years I would like to see the spirit of God come into our churches and bring oldfashioned conviction back into the hearts of man and woman where they realize I'm lost I'm lost and on my way to hell I need a savior I need Jesus to savor amen amen if we had a little bit more of that I wonder how much less people would think we're crazy when it comes to this message cuz they hear us talking about Rapture they hear talking about the greatest truth in the world but yet oldfashioned conviction is something that's never preached to people no more believe the message believe the prophet amen amen amen oh you got it brother you're on the way but if they don't realize they're a sinner they'll never receive a savior if they never receive a savior they can never receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost have they never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen there is no Rapture laying out ahead of them hell lays ahead of them but to preach on hell not in the message brother Ben surely but there are going to be some people around the ranks go to hell right amen they will because their attitude is I'm religious I'm a good person there is no such thing you can live every day of your life and not make one mistake and you're still a sinner by your birth I don't care if you're as holy as Holiness is is pouring out of your ears I don't care if you're so so religious that spiritual sugar is pouring out of your mouth I I don't care how sweet you might be when it comes to religion if you're not converted amen you still don't have the goods inside of your heart that makes you a saint that's what makes you a saint is the baptism of the Holy Ghost God I wish somebody would help me preach tonight exactly right that's what turns a man into conversion that's what brings a person into the presence as our sister saying of Jesus Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now I know what you might be thinking so let me hit it quickly brother said a man could have the Holy Ghost every hour of his life still die and go to hell events made clear by prophecy modern events made clear by prophecy brother B is referring to a person that has the Holy Ghost on the human Spirit yes flesh and spirit it's never entered into the soul what we're talking about tonight is not rain on the flesh not the reign of the Holy Ghost on the spirit washing their memory making them Sanctified cleaning them up they can preach the gospel they can be ever so holy we're talking about a conversion of the Soul oh Jesus may you help us Lord to realize what what I'm getting ready to say the problem is not a flesh problem many people around the ranks have got that one down pat they don't do this they don't do that glory to God we don't go here we don't watch that we don't listen to this they've got that down pth when it comes to their Spirit their memory can quote quotes like pouring Peas on a dry C High when it comes to imagination they can paint such a picture of Heaven make you cry crocodile tears but when it comes to the soul amen that's what makes a man what he's supposed to be when it comes to the soul of a human being because without the holy ghost in the soul there's still a sinner I don't care how religious they [Applause] are amen am I preaching that fast you listening that slow but the rest of the Dead live not for the space of a thousand years that's right just holy spirit filled people was all that went into the Rapture this is the reason the foolish virgin miss it because her lamps had gone out yes what virtue what holy ghost power they was able to bring in maybe the brother said they're highly Sanctified type people so what Holy Ghost they was able to absorb in it lasted for but a season but it never went down to the soul but for the elect not only did she have oil in her lamp but she had an inexhaustible Supply hallelujah oh I love to say what I'm getting ready to say brother Bob there's something about a genuine Christian you just can't put their lamp out because you try to drain them out and there's another Supply waiting on that one try to drain that out there's another Supply just like with the lampstands when the oil would go out of one he would fill it right back up again and keep the flame of burning can I tell you something it's never been me making the flame burn it's been my Holy Ghost oil amen every time I got low he would just fill me back up he said what Holy Ghost many refilling thank you Jesus exactly right that's the only reason I'm going to make it not because of me because of him that's the reason you're going to make it not cuz you cuz him oh but brother Ben I have long hair I have long dresses I I don't beat my wife I don't I don't slap my dog I don't kick my cat I'm a good person goodness don't make them the spirit of God makes them you know the atheist philosophy of life is to be a good person so if you just want to be a good person you're a co-equal with atheist then that's right you believe the thing they do woo come on preach brother Ben right it's deeper than that Jesus wouldn't have said these words unless there was another level that a person could go to after hearing the truth of the word there was another place amen that a man or woman could travel to to make a spiritual something in their heart that was the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth it's more than just hearing the word Judas heard the word amen that's right y'all ready for this brother said 1964 Judas preached the gospel and the devil preached the gospel in Judas he said when Judas was baptized the devil was baptized woo come on now walk with Jesus fish with Jesus hunted with Jesus travel with Jesus preach conventions with Jesus cast out Devils with Jesus but he himself was a devil goes to prove you can walk ever so close to this word and this truth but until a man is converted it's just religion hallelujah hallelujah it's just religion that's all it is amen amen it's just religion St John 16:12 let's let's go on a little bit I've only got three or four more hours here don't get in a hurry amen St John 16:12 now let let's see what Jesus said about this this spirit of God now I I don't want to give you the impression that truth doesn't bring you into this Holy Ghost but what I want to try to establish for you is that just hearing truth alone doesn't bring a person there because remember anybody with an eardrum can hear the words of the Gospel reverberate against their eardrum and their eardrum move and they hear what's being said but to truly hear it remember Jesus said it takes a spiritual ear to hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches the only way you can hear it and the only way you can have a spiritual ear is if the spirit of God is living inside of your heart to hear his own word now St John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now why took the Holy Ghost to Bear them that's right amen there were certain things that Jesus couldn't preach to them because they wasn't converted amen hang on everybody but there's only certain things a preacher can preach to some people because some people aren't converted amen amen I've had folks tell me later well why didn't you tell me that cuz you wasn't converted yet praise the Lord well I would if I had known that I said wasn't ready for it yet amen you got to have the Holy Ghost if you're born again certain things Jesus can say if you're not certain things Jesus won't amen I've preached in churches where people didn't even understand what the Holy Ghost all about denominations organizations different things and you'd be sitting there it's an entirely different message altoe there's certain things you feel that spirit of God when you're around message people pulling in a certain direction then you go out around some people and you don't feel any pull at all you know why people sitting there converted you can't talk to them about converted things if they're unconverted sometimes you just best off Brother Martin just get through your notes and get out come on somebody cuz if they're not spiritual they're not going to understand you anyhow what good does it do to to tell them anything if they're not don't have a spiritual heart to receive it you might as well just get through it and get out amen that's right now watch now how be it when he not it he read your Bible he so the Holy Ghost is not an it it's not a Doctrine it's not a book it's a he amen right praise the Lord hallelujah friends honestly you think when we get to heaven all we're going to do is fuss about Doctrine hopefully to God we're going to fellowship with the person the person of the word that's what I want to fellowship with don't you that's what I want to be in relationship with I want to have a relationship with the person of the word because remember when there are certain things in this book right here that I don't understand the man who wrote it knows his own word and he can reveal things to me that I can't necessarily put together right here well when that one preacher told Brother Bram you don't know your Bible very well he said no but I know the author oh it may me wonder brother BR I want to turn around and tell him you don't know your author very well but you know the Bible anyhow how be when he the spirit of Truth has come he not it that's right he will what guide you into all truth amen well I just don't know if I'm going to get it if you got the Holy Ghost this is a promise in the word that says you're going to get it you may not get it today you may not get it tomorrow but he promised that you're going to get it someday it may be after your body has changed you walk into the gates of Pol and there it is you get it I'm serious I'm serious it may just be that way there may be certain things that God would hide from you until the very moment your body has changed and you take that first breath of eternal life and all of a sudden it comes clear as a bell thing you've been wondering about all your life he promised all truth somebody say all truth all truth amen not some amen well brother Ben I I'm I'm a female I'm a woman I'm a sister I just probably never understand the godhead never understand the s all truth if you need it to make the Rapture he will reveal it to you I I hope you're getting it in other words the person going in the Rapture According To Jesus if they've got this he on the inside of them then that person will not believe in trinitarianism that person cannot be buried in Triune baptism that's what Jesus said right here I'm reading you what the what the Lord Jesus said he said he when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth amen so if you've truly got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not going to worship brother brandom you're not going to be a Catholic you're not going to be a Methodist you're not to be a presbyterian you're going to go where to where all truth is at and may I go on record right here tonight all truth is in the message of William Maryam Brandon right here tonight they want to know where the words at it's right here here under the message of the seventh angel that's where all truth has been revealed right people arguing and fuss well I was this and I was that I I don't doubt friends that God didn't as he did the children of Israel lead people out of Egypt the Holy Spirit began leading them friends the very moment they began crying out there under those task Masters that was the Holy Ghost leading those people to get out of Egypt I don't doubt when some of you was an organization and what more that the Holy Ghost didn't start working on you and start dealing with you bringing you out but you got to remember remember one thing when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth I don't care if you're saved or you're not saved he started guiding you from the very first days amen he started guiding you into that and his promise is I will guide you into all truth oh God I feel like shouting I wish I could get this out the way I feel it to guide in other words he says here to be a teacher to give guidance to to lead one in the way yes so once he committed to show you what's right he can never show you what's wrong he can only show you what's right people friends they're so confused well maybe I'll get confused what if I get on a website and I get confused I got news for you if you are a child of the Living God and you get on a website and you get confused it is not your responsibility it is not my responsibility it is not anybody's responsibility to drag you out of that thing according to the Lord Jesus here it is his responsibility to drag you out of there and bring you back to the truth of the word of God no preacher no Bishop no Mama no Daddy can do it he promised I I will lead and guide you into all [Applause] truth amen amen amen well maybe some preacher would leave me that's what the tape folks always are crying and snotting about oh some preacher lead me into error if you're a child of God he promised to lead you into the truth amen so some preacher leads you off the word it is God's responsibility to lead you back on it amen come on now say Amen now nobody else bears that burden or that responsibility Jesus took that upon his shoulders himself oh the elect can't be deceived I agree with you but that don't mean they won't get confused that won't mean they won't get an error from time to time or follow something that may not be 100% right but in their human ways when they get off the path a little way that's where our guide steps in and says Hey There Brother Paul you go you're veering you got to come back over this way boy oh I'm so thankful to God tonight that the guide is laying inside of my heart and leads and guides me into all truth and righteous thank God he's there brother Mark thank you Jesus God he's inside of my heart wasn't for that we'd all be lost amen amen amen but he promised to lead us he promised to guide us amen for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and show you things to come so not only will he lead you into all truth but he will show you things to come well I I don't know what my next decision is wait on the guide I don't know what I'm supposed to do next wait on the guide he promised to show you things to come I believe one reason we get messes we don't wait on the God come on now we don't wait on him long enough to find out should we buy this house or should we buy this car or should we make this dead or should we take this job if we'd wait on him he would show us here's the right decision this is the way you do it but friends we get too hasty we getting jumping ahead because we're too independent we think we can handle the business ourselves that's the reason we're no more spiritual what we are but if we ever learn to lose oursel and die on that Cross of Calvary and get over our self will and let him lead the show everything will run smooth amen Matthew chapter 15: 7 Matthew chapter 15 verse 7 Oh Glory Hallelujah praise the Lamb of God Amen are you hanging on Amen hang on for dear life cuz I probably won't go slow tonight the way I'm feeling Matthew 15: 7 I found out last night y'all still didn't have enough room for me to preach up here so I to get out yonder you know it just gets to feeling good the walls start swelling brother J you just you just you just can't hold it you got to get out amen now once Jesus speaking to the religious of that day remember what we said last night there they crucified him there most holy city they most holy people crucified him Prince of Life Now Jesus speaking to these same people look at this words ye Hypocrites amen that's what I said to you earlier about this Bunch going to Jesus by Night Nicodemus we know you're a teacher come from God slimy hypocrite amen amen that's right you afraid to say it afraid to make that kind of a statement oh I'd hate to be a little bit too rude sometimes Jesus gets rude sometimes friends I don't mean to offend or hurt but he calls white white black black and let me tell you something the day and age we're living in you better not play around with somebody you better tell them the truth this is an age of spiritual deception everywhere you turn around everybody's got the right answer everybody's got the right way to turn everybody's got the answer to Life's problems so you better tell them what's right you better tell them what's the truth and the only way to sometimes get the message across is call it just call a spade of spade and Jesus knew if I play around with these guys they're going to quote me to death he said so I just call them what they are you a bunch of Hypocrites amen woo y'all are just too nice well did Isaiah prophesy of you now watch this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth uh-huh and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me amen you know this repeats yes this isn't just that age this is this age too people in this age brother Carson they'll be able to say what's right tell what's right tell what the prophet said Moses said Mo but their heart is far from him amen amen this goes to prove to you that a person could actually be sitting in the house of God and doing lip service to the word and never really be converted inside of their heart amen oh Lord look at verse n but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctor the Commandments of men that's right so these wasn't just lay folk these were preachers too look at what Jesus said teaching for doctrines amen so these people were teaching for doctrines the Commandments of man amen that's right Amen brother Ben preach it buddy stay with it amen hallelujah amen friends 90% of the stuff people come up around the ranks of this message that's all it is doctrin of man that's right 99% it's a bunch of hogwash people want you to live a certain way and act a certain way and dress a certain way as long as it's what they think should be done amen Hey listen I don't do things your way you don't do things my way we're supposed to be doing it God's [Applause] way everybody got different cultures and customs and ways you you go to you go to Africa I've been there a few times and and and bright colors and certain little flamboyanes and things and some of us white folks would pass out to have to wear some of the colors some of them African Saints would that's true you go to India they have a certain way about them you go to New Zealand they got a certain way about them let me I could never be as quiet as some of you newes are out here it's the culture it's the custom of things but you cannot take a custom and make a Doctrine out of it that's the doctrines of man but we got to stay with the word the word is what our standard of life is man that's what we preach and teach the people we try to tell them what the word says not what I think I think something forget it my thoughts just as equal with your thought and vice versa but the word the word is what's going to get us out of here man makes the difference amen I mean i' I've been in churches around the message in Ohio years back preachers instruct the deacons have a measuring stick out make sure the sister's dresses are so far from the floor you know what that is it's a lacking of the preaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right cuz let me tell you something right now if a man or woman's got the Holy Ghost the only measuring stick they need is that Bible that's being preached on the platform amen that's the only measuring Rod they need not about your legalism let the word Oh my Jesus said when the Holy Spirit comes he will approve the world of Darkness let them get born again brother I'm talking about those African women standing he said they were naked because they were blanket natives he said but when the Holy Ghost come down they put their arms over their breast brother said who told them that they were naked amen not some preacher not some Deacon not some trustee or housewife the Holy Ghost told them they were naked we want people to live right let the Holy Ghost dict to dictate to them what's right and wrong but we're living in the days of Judges every man does what's right in his own eyes so we try to press upon others our feeling and if we're not careful what we've done is we've made a pattern of what we say the Holy Ghost is and we've created our own formula and by creating our own formula we have to leave the old formula to get them to the new one amen well friends that's what Pentecost done you got to have the Holy Ghost better speak in tongues what was that a created formula of what it took to get the Holy Ghost we've done the same thing around the ranks this message believe Joseph's a prophet believe brother B's a prophet believe believe in this thing believe in return Ministry believe in perusia we've done the it's a measuring stick it's it's a it's a created doctrine that try to bring people into what they think is God but oh listen to me the formula has never changed repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost man a woman fully repents then they receive the Holy Ghost CH of the Holy Ghost to be given cuz when a man a woman repent when they genuinely repent that means go out of the sinning business just turn away from it all together every false Doctrine every habit every lie every idea they crucify thems on Calvary turn it away completely amen amen turn around and go the opposite way yeah amen right when a man a woman fully gets down and gives her heart to God I mean fully gives their heart to God you don't have to tell that person you better not do this better not do that there'll be something on the inside of him that's right I remember when I first got it brother Gerald I didn't know what was right I didn't know what was wrong I was raised up in a little church at believe return Ministry and all we were doing twiddling our thumbs waiting for Brother brand to come back brother B we didn't know anything about the message as far as what the real message was all about but after I got it I was sitting out one day and there was a fell that I've been been fussing with in school and he pushed me down I jumped up to go get him and I felt something swirl in my heart like this and said says don't you do that oh am let me tell you something I didn't read it in the book I didn't even read it in the Bible amen but I had the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost told me don't you RAR back don't you fight back amen people around the ranks this message want revelation but I would to God they had a little bit of what I got when I was a teenage boy back here in that camp cuz if they had a little bit of that inside of their heart they wouldn't need a message book to tell them it's right or wrong the spirit of God would Quicken their heart to what's truth amen oh you say but we need the word I'm coming to that but I want to get this part in first because there's a whole lot more that goes with this if you'll understand more than just being able to read a a certain study and adhere to that certain study and say that that that's the way it's going to be right there it's deeper than that amen it's deeper than that in vain they worship St John 14: 16 say John CH 14: 16 one preacher said to me long long ago so we need to make him stop I said okay let's preach the Holy Ghost then that's right amen cuz friends let me tell you something in my years in the platform I'm only barely half of what brother Gerald's been 51 years he told me coming in I'm just a baby in this thing but I I've been around just a little bit what a little bit I've learned is that if you drag them in somebody else will drag him out right amen you beat it in somebody else will bless them out you cannot make nobody do nothing praise the Lord church if it's not in their heart you cannot make them do it I don't care what you quote or what you say though one would be raised from the dead and one was raised from the dead the Lord Jesus raised right in front of their eyes and he told him and told him and told him and told him and they went on and done their own thing anyways why it wasn't in their heart in the beginning amen St John 14 amen St John chapter 14 look here at verse 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he not it amen he may abide with you forever that's right it's a person and if it is a person it is a personality amen listen to me if I've got the person in me I should have his personality amen I should have his character I should have his life I should have his sweetness I should have his gentleness I should have his patience I should have his long suffering I should have everything he is should be what I am if I'm in him and he's in me I should take on his personality that's what the Holy Ghost is you're taking on Christ's personality what he loves you love what he hates you hate what he stands for you stand for what he rejects you reject come on now that's right watch that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive that's right amen it's impossible for him because it seeth him not amen neither knoweth him oh glory to God but ye know him amen for he dwelleth with you do you know what Jesus was calling himself the future Holy Ghost amen he's saying he is dwell with you right now but then look what he said he'll be in you later did you catch it he said I'm here with you right now but in a little while I ain't going to be standing by you I'm going to be in you oh God somebody come on that's what I'm talking about Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah to the Lamb of God it's Christ in the human heart that's what makes them what they are not because of who stands by me but who's living inside of [Applause] me I imagine these people probably people probably felt quite honored to walk by Jesus and talk with Jesus and eat with Jesus and all that sure but how much greater of an honor was it for that same Jesus they walked with and talked with and hunted with to be living on the inside of [Applause] them I'm still not convinced we get it right huh you hear me I'm still not convinced we get it right cuz if we really knew who was living on the inside of us and we recognize fully who that was on the inside I guarantee many of our problems would look like a real Shadow and I believe the bride is coming to a place to where not only she recognizes who she is but recognizes who is living inside of her hallah amen and if you recognize he is inside of you and he is the omnipotent God with all power all authority everything is subject under his hand under his name no greater name could be given than the name of Jesus Christ and that same Jesus Hallelujah has living on the inside of your heart when you recognize that you'll be an invincible [Applause] Army praise the Lord I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you amen not we amen that's right brother I because there ain't three of them it ain't a trinity it ain't a twinity amen only one yet in a while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also praise the Lord [Laughter] hallelujah amen if that don't buckle it down I don't know what else to do now let's move from this part and show now how that it comes to you and I Romans chap 10: 13 now here comes the part of the service where most message people I don't expect you newlanders to do this I know you're a whole lot more spiritual than most of the people I preach to in the states no offense State side but this is where a lot of people have a tendency to draw back because what I'm getting ready to show you is how you got the Holy Ghost it may not come the way you thought it did but this is certainly the Bible Way of how you got it let's go ahead and tell you so that everybody will relax a little bit you got it through preaching amen amen oh not me glory to God I got it the cornfield one day talk but how you learned of it was because of preachers you see that Bible you got in your hand full of pre preachers Matthew Mark Luke that's right Jesus Jesus was a preacher Bible said he was said he was a preacher to the to the circumcision sure he was Jesus went into the synagogue and preached why he was a preacher so for these folks that are against preachers they're against Jesus cuz he was a preacher and hey Jesus went in and read a sko scho every now every now and he played the tape but he preach too amen somebody said they played tapes I said I ain't got nothing wrong with that as long as they realize they got to preach eventually too I'm talking to you you ain't listening to me come on now through the foolishness of preaching God chose that to confound the wisdom of the wise did you know what I'm doing right now is foolishness did you know that what I'm doing right now is foolishness people don't understand what's going on they think this is the stupidest thing in the world people from the outside look at you bunch of people sitting here nodding your head at me screaming and spitting all over the place and they what in the world a matter with them bunch of idiots that doesn't help anything oh if they only understood if they only could see what it is it ain't a bunch of Unholy idiots or a bunch of imiles like the world tries to paint us or his brother bandam called it holy rollers it ain't a bunch of that it's people setting under the opes of the word and as the word Goes Forth they are conforming into the same oh God I feel like hauling and screaming as the image is set before him and that's what a preacher tries to do is paint the picture of what you're supposed to be paint the picture of the potential paint the picture of what God said about you and as you behold that image in the word amen it lets you see what you are and as you behold it you're changed into the very same image somebody said to me and said well glory to God God's in Jeffersonville I said yep he's there and he's also in Manchester he's also in St John's he's also anywhere the bride is that's where God's at somebody said he's out in so and so and air as I said anywhere the bride's at that's where God's at cuz Paul said that's his body you are the a body of Jesus Christ and members in particular amen listen to me I've got to say this I can't hold back and say this I'll ruin my reputation if I keep quiet the bottom line is God never called tape players that's right am he called humans thank God for the prophet thank God for the voice thank God for playing tape thank God I would to God we'd spend them in our homes 24 hours a day 7 days a week that voice of God was designed to get us ready for the Rapture to get us out of here I believe what brother B said I believe that message is important to us we need to know it backwards and forwards if it's our road mapap to get out of here we need to know the Bible as well amen absorb oursel and and and and bathe oursel and baptize oursel in the word of God I believe that but that word has got to become flesh that's right it's got to become skin amen like I mentioned to you last year when the Rapture comes and the bombs are falling and resurrection's up and trumpets are sounding and Gabriel and the horn and the whole bit when all of this is going on every tape every book and every Bible you've ever loved will be laying in ashes underneath the ground amen but the word will be living on the word will be living on you know why cuz the word ain't onion skin pages and and the word ain't tapeh heads and the word ain't MP3 players and the word it is the Bride of Jesus Christ who has got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the Living Word today people want to know where she's at take you a good look right here to soft and flabby as it is what you laughing at Romans 10 ver 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved glory to God brother Ben that's right don't stop there keep reading how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard oh boy now we getting deep amen yes see what do I do now do I read this or while everybody's happy I'll just quit now sing a song and go ahead read read it okay okay and how shall they hear without a [Music] preacher Jesus I say brother bram's my preacher okay let's line it up with the Bible Ephesians 4: 11 and he gave some amen Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and Pastor for what for the perfecting of the body amen that's right okay if that's the purpose of a Preacher then then it isn't just one preacher you're not perfected just by your pastor that's why men like me come by that's why men like brother Mark teach that's why men like George Smith and brother Andre and these brothers come by because it's all of these Ministries working together as a team we are a team I not here to put brother Gerald down or up or I am a team member and he may be the quarterback but I'm over here blocking with the ball amen running by I'm blocking to keep the devil away in my own way of doing it we're a team we're team members working under the same cause under the same opes we are working for the same cause amen well but brother Ben I I don't know I'm a little scared of preachers I am too I've met a lot of bad ones but I've met some good ones too and I figure if God puts it in his word he's going to have a five-fold ministry that's going to be right on the word I figure it's God's obligation to make sure we've got some good ones available yeah good as few as there may be as you know skim as it may be uh uh you know there's just a couple of us maybe eight or 10 of us around the world that actually care you know ain't that funny am you can say Amen about the preachers but I wonder if I could turn that around on congregations cuz there's a lot of people I preach to that ain't sincere either probably just a handful in the churches I preach to Jesus but this is how he said you get it through the preaching this is how you receive the Holy Ghost through the preaching oh you say but wait a minute I I don't understand it all right ohy when Simon Peter stood up and said repent be baptized what was he doing what was he doing he's preaching brother said he gave the greatest sermon that could ever be given in 15 minutes oh god brother Gerald we need to take lessons ain't that right buddy amen can we get a long wind of this I don't know but he was preaching the gospel that's the whole reason the people were pricked in their heart because the word comes through the body and the body was preaching to other members of the body amen that's right verse 15 how should they preach except they be sent as is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel Isaiah say Lord who have believed our report so then here's our famous scripture Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word amen oh that's right brother Ben just push play wait wait wait wait a minute how did Paul say they heard again you just got to go back up to verse 14 and you'll find out how he said they heard Faith came by hearing how shall they hear without a preacher hold on everybody if rapturing Faith lays in the mess message of the hour and the message of the hour is what brings rapturing Faith to the bride then in other words without a gift you don't have the ability as lay people to go into that message and pull out those elements of rapturing faith and apply them to yourself so God gifted five-fold offices to in in the manifold way he gifted them to go into that message and pull out the elements for rapturing faith God I feel like like spontaneously combusting Amen to go into that word and pull out Hallelujah the elements of what it takes for rapturing Faith do you realize rapturing faith will come through the preaching of the word that you yield yourself to amen this is the whole reason why when you come to church you should open your heart wide open cuz whether you know it or not the the elements for rapturing Faith are being preached into your person amen and into your soul because a man of God has the ability to go into that message and pull out those elements and preach them to the people of God and those that have got the Holy Ghost they'll grab onto that word and they'll bring it into their heart and become one with it oh oh thank you Lord Jesus Romans chapter 6 verse5 now let's really get to preaching here for a minute Romans chapter 6 verse 5 here comes some really really good stuff I want to share with you watch what Paul says now this then this is also the way the Holy Ghost comes now notice the words that Paul uses here planted Resurrection death planted let's put it in the right order planted death Resurrection planted death Resurrection this is how the Holy Ghost comes amen for if we've been planted together in the life Ness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection oh Hallelujah verse six knowing this that our old man is crucified with him amen well friends isn't this what I told you last night if you're not willing to hang on an Old Rugged Cross there comes no Resurrection you can't hang up this old guy in a in a closet and pull him out every Sunday or put him back in on Sunday every what the case might be no he's got to die life comes from Death that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin glory to God Amen next time the Devil comes by and tells you you're bound just quoting that one right there that I am free and free indeed For Whom the sun sets free is free indeed you realize what it is the devil's just lying to you he's just lying to you trying to let on like you're certain and you're not bound by sin if you've received the Holy Ghost you are not bound by sin you are dead to it and free from it [Applause] forever amen you're completely dead all together watch him in verse say now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him amen how you supposed to live after you die comes a resurrection am and it's not you that's resurrected it's the Christ on the inside that's resurrected brother B said death to the old man life to the new amen the old man is dead he's crucified he's done away with and that little germ of life on the inside which is Christ at the beginning once it becomes gerti by the preaching of the word remember when Paul said Paul planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase so while you're sitting there hearing the word something's happening something's being planted something's dying something's being resurrected too how under the preaching of the word of God that's how these things are happening notice in the sign of the time brother man said we have so much on the mechanics and not too much on the Dynamics now my body is the mechanics but my body will not operate without the Dynamics or my spirit the spirit operates my body brings it in control he said like an automobile with no gasoline in it no firing power amen no matter how fine the mechanics is fixed up the cylinders points plugs and whatever more it's got to have a current he said that's the way God is listen to this if you it's got to get a believer with God to make the contact and then when it makes contact with God something's got to [Applause] happen amen oh praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost get him in contact with God and then all of this begins to come out that's the reason why when you hear the preaching of the word of God remember the prophet of God said in in MDC he tells us that when you heard heard that the Living Word of God he said what real Eagle food for you he said you left that other thing he said you've then been formed of the living image of the Living God he said you heard from your theophany amen cuz don't forget there was something that was in God before I was here this flesh is the last element of many many great things that God's already done for me and his mind before the foundation of the world I was already a germ seed in his mind I was a thought I was an attribute was a part of him he was the male I was the female I was my name was on the Lamb's Book of Life and this flesh was only manifested Hallelujah that that something in God could manifest oh y'all ain't hearing me tonight that something that God had could manifest through this frussy body that's the reason I'm not the same person I was before I got saved I think different I act different I talk different I walk different why I've been formed into the image of the Living God I become a different personality if a person gets the Holy Ghost Lord once they're born again you will see Christ in that person I don't care how hard a trial they go through or how difficult or what circum you'll see Christ in that person because if God's there the only thing he can do is Manifest his great personality you cannot hide from it you cannot run from it you can pretend like it wasn't there you can you can talk yourself into it not having much power let a little squeeze come on you'll find out who's in charge come on somebody let no trouble hit the household and a child gets sick and the doctor say the word cancer or some other disease or some other germ let something happen and that Christ on the inside goes to working out his great personality that's why many times when you was about ready to give up something on the inside of you begin to raise up and say how can you quit something you never started in the first place amen the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah something on the inside of that Christ on the inside his personality raises up at the right moment amen we can try to keep him suppressed that all it takes is for the right Sun for the right moisture for the right fertile ground and that seed just starts manifesting what's on the inside of it you can try to hate somebody but if he's on the inside he pushes that hate out and Christ just loves and loves oh Hallelujah you can try to have a bad feeling you can try to make an excuse but that personality just squeezes all that stuff out of there Hallelujah you can't keep from it you you can try your best to get yourself in the middle of a complex and God will show you a dream like he did brother brandom and show you you're on a wrong road don't you understand when brother Brandon went through that complex he tells about in 63 when he talks about standing in the Gap and how he got upset and do you understand that if God had not had his hand on him and he didn't have the baptism of holy ghost that have been the end of William Brandon right there but justce it wasn't the end of of William brandom neither is it the end of the Bride because we've all come to them same places them dark valleys where we didn't think we could take another step forward but what was it his great personality oh thanks be to God his life his nature his power his authority everything he is I am the vine you the branches and that power energized you and before you knew it you was back up walk this ain't so bad after all what was it his personality and do you know his personality is he don't never give up he doesn't know the word defeat Hallelujah he doesn't know what the word quit means he's never been defeated never will he ever be defeated and if he's in the heart of the Bride that's his personality that's my personality it's yours amen my so the old man is crucified firing power message rising of the sun brother man said notice Philip full of this quickening power he went down to Samaria the devil was being cast out people baptized in the name of Jesus the spirit spoke to him the dyam has come and said you'll have to leave this revival said oh but Lord what will the minister say said don't make any difference he was full of quickening power he had gasoline and the Dynamics was Fallen upon him said go out in the desert and he found a unic there and baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ you remember with this said you can go back and look at it another time you get a chance when he comes up he finds him reading the scroll of Isaiah this man this poor fell was a part of a tape church and in desperate need of a Preacher amen woo thank you Jesus and he says understand what you read now this man had a whole lot more sense than many of the people around this message he said how can I except some man guide me he didn't say the word lead he said guide me because you understand a real preacher we're not leaders we're guides amen we're guides we are great leaders cuz we're great followers any man that's a great leaders cuz he's a great follower of Jesus Christ he follows the Lord Jesus as he follows the Lord Jesus he can lead the people as he follows him this man needed guidance and God sent him a preacher prise Jesus my found a unic there baptized him that man took the message down to Ethiopia he obeyed God in obedience to God he said if you've never been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ do it and watch the quickening Power pick you up you hear said he said if you've never been baptized what's he using he's going back to the formula he's plugging in the formula how people get the Holy Ghost amen you hear the preaching you repent you're bapt you die on the cross you repent and so forth you're baptized that's death by the way I told somebody one time I said I know that I'm I'm that Ben norad's dead they said how do you know I said cuz I was there when they buried him Hallelujah cuz I was buried in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah about 26 years ago I went under the water why I was crucified on Calvary with Christ he buried me in baptism and I come up in the resurrection of Life the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost came down and changed me made me a new man praise the Lord The Old Man Died the seed came to life am that's the quickening power of the seed now that's not to say that everybody that listens at tapes and things is in the wrong but eventually they've got to come to this program of needing somebody to explain the word to them amen that goes for every single one of you here you can stream you can listen to messages you can get CDs and MP3s from other brothers but eventually you need somebody to come and take that word and expound it and break it down to your am we call them pastors that's what a pastor is supposed to do take the things that you don't understand break them down make them simple so the people can understand it that's what a teacher is supposed to do position that word and lay it out foundationally he's on thin eyes you see Lord cuz when a teacher teaches the word he's not preaching preaching is generalized it's generalizations I say get saved get born again get the Holy Ghost all means the same thing but when a man's teaching he's on thin ice he can't emphasize more than one thing cuz saved is not necessarily a born again born again is not necessarily the Holy Ghost there's a lot of different meanings that go with that when you're teaching but he takes all them little phrases and all them little hard to understand places and positions them together in the scripture and man he's running a 100 miles in every direction and you better keep on cuz he's a teaching locomotive and brother B said he can put together he sit under the anointing and sit there and listen and put together things that the pastor or the Evangelist can't even touch yeah Hallelujah brother R said warning than judgment he's got his place is a part of the team amen that's right A lot of people if a man ain't jumping up and down spitting and slobbering and Hauling at devils and everything El well he's not breaking the word he's not it's not preaching I beg your pardon sometimes you need somebody to help you understand what it means amen as I said many people around this message they become what when I was a boy I watched wrestling okay you'll forgive me Andre the Giant Hulk Hogan the whole thing thing Jamie knows I I I I I loved it and I'd read about these guys you know I I thought it was really really neat how they would do their deals and all that and I used to get so excited when Hogan would start doing his little shaking stuff you know just rally oh that's great I'd read these guys and I found out that wrestlers have what they call a cheap pop what that means is they go into the city whatever city they're in and they'll say good to be in New York tonight and all the people will Ah that's what they call a pop ah so so they'll use what they call a cheap pop something everybody can relate with so they'll holler so they name their City cuz they know everybody's going to holler at their City I said some preachers have become cheap pop artists amen that's right they've learned how to get in the platform and say where the bride where are the elected we're going to heaven everybody goes but if I stood at that back door with a clipboard and I asked you what does bride look like what does bride believe who is the Bride of Jesus Christ and what's her position I doubt many of the people in this message could even answer those questions like that cuz to them it's just about cheap [Applause] pops don't get mad at me love me it's true praise the lord we need people in the message that can break the word down make it simple for us help us understand what it means for baptism and understand what it means for Holy Ghost we need men like that in this body we need them absolutely oh my Lord Dynamic power how can I except some man guide me what watch again God's provided Place brother B said like Samuel said to the people one time I've ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass he said whatever I said it happened he said oh said we know but we want the king anyway he said that's the way it is people want to hold on to their Petty ideas their Creeds they want to hold on to it and talking about a Revival in our day how can we have Revival when it's all messed up the way it is right watered gasoline yes he called it he said and everything else mixed into it detergents modernistic things mixed into it that's right amen he said but what we need he said we need a real birth and he said and we know that any birth is a mess I don't care if it's a pig pin or a pink decorated hospital room any birth is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess that's right it'll make you boohoo it'll make you cry it'll make you carry on Amen y'all don't understand what brother B's talking about don't you all right boohoo you know that that's crying but that's not this little one tear goes down the side of your face and you that's not boohoo that's not boohoo you you just got a little bit overwhelmed and amen for a brief moment you just a little tear slipped out accidentally boohoo is when you can't control yourself amen come on church amen you're uncontrollable in the presence of God you're just pouring out your heart you can't stop what you're doing it just keeps flowing and flowing and flowing Hallelujah am amen that's what he meant by boohoo and it's a mess amen but nowadays in our message we got such a repentance is a matter of well Jesus I'm sorry I done a few bad things here and there but in our hearts we don't we don't say this out loud in our hearts we're kind of saying but you know I'm not all altogether a bad person um I I know that I'm you know but so and so over there he's just as bad as I that's not repentance that's right uhuh that ain't what repentance is all about repentance is when a person comes to the reality I'm a sinner and if something don't happen to me I'm on my way to hell when they get that reality and that moves inside of their heart it ain't about Revelation and Doctrine then brother it's about the person of God the person of God washing away their sins taking that old man and burying them under the sea of God's forgiveness and bringing Resurrection into their heart making them a brand new person amen watered down gasoline got detergents mixed in it no wonder people can't get a spark cuz the formula is simple repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but we have spread those little phrases apart and put this in and this in and this in and then this in and this this and this and this and this so there no wonder that people sit right around in message churches and you still hear the question out of people 40 50 60 70 years old I don't even know if I got the holy ghost or on you know why because we've watered down the meaning and the message of the Gospel am we've made it about affiliation rather than reconciliation Jes and that's where we need some old fashioned preaching cuz Hey folks you young people listen to me the oldfashioned stuff was where the good stuff was at you say you don't know nothing about it but I've tasted I've tasted of what the old fashion was and I know it's real the oldfashioned stuff is where the good stuff is at TH this modern day thing of everybody clapping on Q and everybody looking good for the cameras and everything so proper that that ain't boohoo and that ain't that ain't the awfulest mess you've ever seen that ain't carrying on like brother Bram said oh Lord and it sure ain't repentance like it needs to be cuz if you've ever come to the reality that you're a sinner don't tell me you're going to sit there with a stone expression on your face when you know hell is laying ahead of you and you know that any moment if you draw your last breath you were on your way to a devil's hell don't tell me a man or woman set there Stone Face with their arms folded acting like everything's all right no it's a dry eye it's an intellectual conceptions what we're seeing not the real baptism of the Holy Ghost amen God give us conviction amen God give us preachers that'll preach with conviction amen tell the people what's true if it takes the hide off them and they lose friends and everything let them tell what's right Praise Jesus amen yeah I'm finished now I I feel it except the corn of wheat Falls and the ground dies it abides alone but people don't want to die they want to be alive in the world still want to be religious that's right so they accept an intellectual conception of it listen to this when you do that you're still dead in sins and trespasses amen he said that's what makes people act the way they do because the spirit that's in them dominates their life because they they kind of they mask it over with a little cloak of religion oh Jes a little religious feeling still dead in their sins and trustpass they don't realize by unbelief they're grieving away their soul and that conviction that they might have had they grieve it away from and the devil lies to them and makes them feel like everything's all right but at the hour of death when that Soul comes back to them they'll realize I've spent my life as a deceiver and I've spent it in vain I said this about John Collins the Bergens and all the rest of these Bunch from believe the sign and they can put it on that camera put it around the world I ain't ashamed what I'm getting ready to say they can run their mouth day and night all they want to but I'll guarantee you one thing when that last hour is on them and the death rattles in their throat and their soul is coming back to them they'll not be worried about no Bridge they'll not be worried about no Cloud they'll be worried about why did I waste my life living as a deceiver I'm on my way to hell and in that hour they'll call for him but it'll be too late they've done grieved it away it's over with don't let us be those kind of people amen don't let this be the the be all end all of what don't accept religion yeah that's plug the formula into your heart and if you're sitting here tonight and you've never fully repented tonight's the night to repent if you've never fully turn it over to Jesus be young be old I don't care who you are if you've never plugged in the formula yes Jesus now is a good time Amen to stop and say God I'm searching my heart I'm searching my soul amen don't let me just have religion let me have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord amen amen let's Stand Together praise the Lord Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus mighty God Mighty Jesus Oh remember the story while Jesus had died then the Roman soldier looked up at him and said surely this must have been the Son of God but it was too late amen it was too late he' done sealed away is hour by mockery debate disgust against the king of Israel but after he dies surely that's the way it always is after he comes and goes then people look through the rearview mirror and they say surely that had to be the truth but you got to remember we're coming to a time that when our rearview mirror comes it'll be preaching to those that can never be saved amen I don't want to scare you but I want to be honest with you I believe we're coming to a time we're already approaching in this message an hour Jesus I believe I'm already preaching to people that can never be saved around this message cuz I've seen people in the message I preach to them year after year after year after year they're getting worse and worse and worse less desire to serve God less desire to live right they get more worldly more hard more did you realize what it is it's people sitting in a church with religion all the way around them surround and circled in religion they've never received the Holy Ghost and neither can they they've crossed the line between mercy and judgment and all you're doing is you're preaching message that's haunting them that's right cuz they know they can never get to it they know they can never reach it oh you say it'll come when the hour The Squeeze is on Lord God open your eyes if you think you're waiting on the squeeze you are you are wrong it's already here amen cuz let me tell you brother sister Holy Ghost churches are hated around this message you listen to brother Ben tonight they're hated around this message a move of God is a despise thing around the ranks of this message they don't want you worshiping and shouting and holling and using gifts and casting out devils and preaching the revelation of the hour they want you to sit down and clap on Q and look good on the camera so they can make a lot of money amen don't you realize what hour we've arrived to we're arriving to the hour where people are being preached to that can never be saved you better wake up newand if you're in that condition tonight you better run to God with everything you got in your heart cuz I'm telling you in the name of the Lord the door is closing it's getting all the way down of the latest hours we've ever been it's getting later than we ever think amen better make sure make sure you're calling an election is sure if you don't have the Holy Ghost tonight's the night you need to Bow your head and say God help me God help me I don't want to discourage you Believers if you've got it hey you hold your confession you hold before the Lord thank you Lord for saving me thank you Lord for giv me the Holy Ghost I don't want to discourage you Believers but if there be per chance it be one sitting in here tonight that that's not really a Believer I want this message to so Pierce their heart tonight that oldfashioned conviction sets in and they want to be changed you can be changed right here tonight let's pray together father hallelujah thank you for your word hallelujah thank you for what we've heard tonight Lord oh Jesus God I know this has been a hard hard hard cutting message but Lord that's the way the gospel's got to be preached sometimes cuz your word Cuts coming and going Lord It's not not a lollipop it's a sword it's not a not a feather duster it's a sword it's not to tickle it's not to smooth things over Lord but it's a sword that cuts and divides aunder even between the soul and the spirit making plain what lays inside of the human heart now God you have so revealed to us the way of receiving the true baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight there's not another place in the world outside of the message ministers that take this Revelation and preach it right or the people every hear the great truth like they've heard tonight Baptist don't got it the Methodist they fail the Pentecostals missed a million miles but here tonight right here in St John's the truth is of the word has been preached and if a person will get a hold of it tonight Lord and God your calling and draw
