sister vet Ellsworth Lord praying your continued Grace to her as she recovers Lord God each one Lord you see the needs you see those that are traveling those that are way Lord we pray you be with them each one Lord grant us Grace now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Galatians chapter 5 Galatians 5 and one amen welcome brother Carson sister Sharon with us amen wonderful to see you make the drive out and get some fellowship with us we surely appreciate it and trusting it'll be a blessing for you as well amen I wanted to thank the church for the gift that you gave myself and the family at Christmas you are very generous we certainly appreciate that and as many of you know we take that and we put it towards a family vacation so we can get some time together away as a family so thank you for each one that gave you know it's been a I think a rough year financially for most of us things have just been cost of living so high and things pop up and maintenance on homes and vehicles and these things and seems like there's more month left than there is money every every month but uh I'm thankful and I'm I'm very appreciative of the gift that you gave us so God bless you each one wanted to thank those that went and visited sister Violet Ellsworth in the hospital many of you went that could and I know she appreciated it once she realized who you were and uh I think just being in a hospital Christmas about the worst way to spend spend it so having people come in and and bring her things and talk to her and encourage her and help her out I know she appreciated it very much so God bless you for that amen God bless you Galatians CH 5:1 says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and I'm going to be very pastoral this morning brother Carson and sister Sharon I hope you don't get in the crossfire this morning but I was talking to brother Matt before service he said brother John I'm going to remind you I love the teaching but I like the preaching even more preaching gets down to where we're living amen and so I want to take a a topic this morning or a thought this morning on Liberty or loopholes Liberty or loopholes and it's this time of year you know as we're approaching the new year and I think it's a good time for us to stop and look back at where we've been and what we've done and how we've lived and how we've made decisions and not just what we've done but what's the fruit of what we've done cuz really what we've done sometimes we don't know what we've done until the fruit comes out you know as Believers we trust that we pray about things and we look to the word of God and we trust that we make the right decisions but really it's not until the decision comes to its full fruition that we see whether it was of God or not whether we found the will or God of God or not and so I think it's a good time to check up and say is my life showing the leadership of the go of the word of God in my life I think we ought to do that every single day not just at the end of the year and as we come into a new year but the reason I say that is because as Believers we're always under attack whether we realize it or not we are always under attack and so often what we see is what we think are the big attacks but really what we need to be worried about are the little attacks that we don't realize have happened because so often what happens is we see big results and we think the result is the attack the result is not the attack the attack is what caused that result this the attack is the seed that was planted the decision that was made the choice that was made that resulted in this big effect see so often we blame Satan for the effect and we are the ones that have made the choice and that's not the way it is so many times you know so many times we've missed where it started because we didn't have discernment of what Satan was trying to do we miss the same things of God many times we don't have the discernment to see what's going on but so often like I said we're seeing the result of the attack and not the attack itself you know I I have to laugh a little bit and maybe it's not something to laugh about but earlier this year remember when Hezbollah had had these attacks going on and their cell phones were blowing up or their Pages were blowing up and this is a terrorist group and Israel knew that they were going to attack them and so Israel blew up their pagers but how do you blow up a pager you can't just blow up a pager Israel had made a sneak attack at the point of manufacturer and put a minor amount of explosive in every single one of those pagers and little did they know the attack had been made it just hadn't had its full result yet and so one day when Hezbollah decides to attack Israel Israel targets thousands of their leadership and their members and in one day they kill a bunch of people and they name a bunch of others and then they think the attack's over and then a day and a half later they blow up their walkie-talkies the attack happened at the source of manufacturer it didn't happen on their bodies but all they had to do was they press the button and that seed that they planted that explosive that they planted it blew up if they'd only guarded the point of manufacturer they wouldn't have been seeing the results of that attack on themselves amen Paul's giving us a warning here not just to the galatian church he's giving it to all of us about a slow slide into things that God has set you free from that God has led you out of that God has has drawn you out of that God has delivered you from because remember Satan is Sly and Satan will get into the narrowest of cracks if we'll open the door listen brother Bram says we've all got one thing we've got to keep covered and we keep it covered by prayer and humility amen we never none of us should think none of us should think Satan can't get me because I'm too spiritual I'm too good of a believer I'm too close to God I've got the Holy Spirit Satan can't get at me Satan never takes a lunch break Satan is there 247 he's got demons there he's got influences he's got all sorts of things pressuring us to try and get us to open up a little window a little door a little crack into our lives so that he can get in and Paul was looking here and he's he's looking at the galatian church and he's not warning them cuz it's not a problem he's warning them because he sees what's going on and he was seeing that things were creeping in that they hadn't that they had been delivered from before and remember we've heard that song sin will take you further than you ever want to go and he's saying look you think that you've come out of it and you think you can handle it and now you're going back into the very things that God Drew you out of in the first place Paul was saying check up and see if you're living where Christ has set you or if you moved back into something else listen brother Braham says we live below our Privileges and so many times we live below our privileges by choice by the decisions that we make day to day Paul said this stand fast that phrase means to persevere stay with it don't back off don't give ground don't fall back hold your position in the Liberty therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not he does not say be not entangled he says be not entangled again this is something that you had in your life before he says don't go back into those things be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage Paul's saying you got a battle not to fall back into those habits back into those things that you used to do now there's context that's required here because Paul's talking about multiple yolks of bondage he was talking about how false Ministry came in and was trying to put the Gentiles under the Mosaic law again and no believer at that time had to be under the Mosaic law Christ had fulfilled the law now they're under a New Covenant of Grace but you had these Jewish teachers that were coming in and trying to PE bring people back to the law in some portion so that they could have a measure of control and he says don't let them put you under a yoke of bondage but they've never been under the law so this would have been a new yoke so he's saying don't be caught up in that but also Beware of the things that I've pulled you out of already amen I'm not here this morning to preach about the ways we've been taught and saying we've come out of it let's not go back to it I believe we've been taught right I believe we're a testimony that we've been taught right in this church we have three generations of Believers here Faithfully serving the lord because we've been taught right but let me say this in all of that teaching right we've still had to come out of things Amen in all of that teaching right we've still had to come out of things because we come into this with ideas and opinions and preferences and the way things are done and then we also velop Traditions as we go through life as we attend church as we go through things we develop these things and we can turn them into a bondage of sorts and we can try and bind people to those things so what I want to say rather this morning what I'm led to say is make sure that what you have is of God and not of yourself because if it is of yourself it's a bondage to you and if you start to apply it to others it's a bondage to them and nobody wins and everybody loses in those situations you know what I remember when I moved to Dallas Texas and and I heard something said over a Pulpit and I repeated it and thank God for brother Aon mcir he says who told you that and I said it doesn't matter it's the word of God he says can you show me that and I said yes I can and then I realized I couldn't because what somebody had told me something and I had taken their word for it because they were a minister rather than checking it with the word of God myself and all of a sudden I'm repeating a lie why because I trusted somebody there's a reason why you have to read your Bible every single day because youve got to have discernment for what's coming over this Pulpit or whatever Pulpit you're listening to or whatever Minister whatever person you're talking to you have to establish the principles of the word for yourself God uses a five-fold Ministry of course we know that for the per perfecting of the Saints but I only get you an hour an hour and a half twice a week what are you going to do the rest of the week you're going to have discernment because otherwise what happens is people will place you in a position of scriptural bondage and guess what it's not scripture it's their scripture it's not the word it's their word it's not God's thoughts it's his it's their thoughts and you can get bound up in these things amen I'm not saying we never grow or mature in our understanding of course we do but God will reveal things as he feels led to in our lives lives but we can't just sit here and take everything we hear from every believer as scripture or as Truth by no means amen I was talking with brother Vel and sister Becky at our house the other day and I said if you can settle the principles of scripture and the way that God works you'll never be led astray there are basic principles that never change in the word and what happens is people will come in and they'll preach the what they call the deeper things of God or the mysteries of God or they'll preach a new Doctrine and if you're established in the principles of the word you'll be able to say Amen or you'll be able to stay quiet because you'll know that doesn't quite line up with the unchanging word of God and the deeper people go usually the further off they get because they forget the principles because they're trying so hard to be different amen we've got to personally have discernment personally have discernment about the things that are being said around us amen because if you don't know the word of God somebody can come in and they can tell you you're not a Believer you're not a Christian you're not a child of God if you don't do this if you don't do this if you don't attend here if you don't believe this if you don't have this evidence if you don't have this effort absolutely we've got people remember I read that story not too long ago of that man that came to brother Bram he says brother brandom I'm just trying to get saved he says I've been to the methodists I've been to the Pentecostals I've been to Oral Roberts I've been to Billy graah I've done everything they've told me and I still don't have it why because they were putting him in unscriptural bondage by their what church ideas remember he shouted when they wanted them to shout he spoke in tongues when they wanted them to speak in tongues he said the sinner's prayer he did all of these things and yet he says I don't have it and brother Brandon pointed him back to when did your mind change towards our Lord Jesus Christ when did you love him and seek after him and he says it's when I read a track and then I got that awfulest feeling inside of me that my life needed to be changed brother Braham says you were saved then and he was trying to satisfy that with what other people were telling him rather than going to the word of God and seeing what it told him to do and how he would know he was saved they have bound him in a yoke of denominational bondage and don't think it can't happen in the message well people will tell you if you haven't done this and you haven't done that church if your life has been changed and you love the Lord Jesus with all your heart soul and mind then you have received him and if he takes you into his word and he continues to reveal it and you continue to live by guess what you've been born again because that's what being born again does is it's a renewing of you it's a changing of you into a new creation and as long as he's changing you that means he's working with you and that's how you know you passed from Death unto life I'm not here to put you in or put you out God help me if I ever tell you you're in or out that is is not my place my place is to point you to Christ and invite you to the Liberty that he offers I don't ever want to bind you to myself I don't ever want to bind you to any Ministry or any Doctrine I want to take you to the word and get you bound to him Paul called himself I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ that's the greatest thing that we could ever be amen bring you to your personal position in the body of Christ so I'm here this morning say let's live in Liberty let's not be under that yoke of bondage but it for the Galatians the law of Moses was not their bondage and if you look further down and we'll get there as we go through Galatians 5 this morning we'll read most of it their bondage was not the law of the Jews their bondage was the life that they had came out of their bondage potentially was the things that God had delivered them from and you'll see that what they had was pretty nasty so often we think what we have is not that bad but let me tell you when Satan takes it and he starts to grow it and those roots start to get in our life it can get pretty nasty it may not be filthy in the traditional sense but it can certainly bind our lives and you'll notice in our lives we never start with fruit wouldn't that be easy if we saw the fruit of everything up front we never start with fruit we always start with a seed we start with a choice we start with a decision we start with a footstep in a certain direction and then it's only afterwards that we see whether we were right or wrong and this is the thing as we're talking about entanglement this morning and Liberty and loopholes if we're bound by something you'll notice we aren't bound up front we're bound at the end that's the thing with entanglement is you never think it's going to be as bad as it is you think that it's either too small to be a bother or a hindrance to you or you think that you can control it that's what we'll see as it comes to entanglement it starts out in a way that thinks you think you can get away with it that you're strong enough Paul says be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage Paul's saying you know what this is you know what this does you know that you needed to be set free before and now you're going back to something that you know you need to be set free from he says it makes no sense you know what you needed to do Paul's saying you're on the road to bondage Again by your own choice that word entangled though it has so many meanings we're going to unpack the scripture this morning I I so enjoyed looking at this because it opened up some things in my life as well that word entangled is not just talking about bondage from Habits and these things but the root behind it it means to harber resentment to hold a grudge and it's speaking of unresolved issues in our life see he's not just talking about dos and don'ts hey let's face it most of us are pretty good with dos and don'ts how are how good are we at resentment issues how good are we at personal problems with people how how good are we at not getting bitter about things that didn't go our way Paul says don't things let get so far that you're so twisted up that you're captured in this situation did you know we can resent god brother viel do you mind me talking a little bit about your testimony is that okay this morning brother Vier was sharing with me he's a young man he's single he's got all this time he's got all this money he's got all this time and he was saying to me see brother Vel loves to learn and as he came to this message he had time on his hands and what he his preference was was to continue his education his preference was to continue to learn and grow do you know why because brother Vel had a plan and you know what God Said No and here's the thing what he needed to do was he needed to get into the word of God and so God spoke to him and he says study my word and serve my body that's what he was told to do now here's the thing brother Vel has a choice now he can resent God for taking away his opportunity or he can praise God for giving him an opportunity his Opportunity by vel's plan or God's Opportunity by God's plan we are talking sister Becky was sharing I was talking a bit about how I when I was in British Columbia and I was moving up the corporate ladder and the next step was president and these different things and I willingly walked away that to preach this gospel and that was happy for me I don't believe it was much of a choice because I was happier preaching the few times I was preaching than anything I was getting in the corporate world but there is a sacrifice certainly of a lifesty style but guess what I'm happier today doing what I'm doing than if I was the president of a $100 million Corporation but if I dwell on the changes if I dwell on the changes and Satan can twist that I can start to focus on the wrong thing that hasn't been a a worry for me by God's grace I'm very happy I'm very content but you've got to realize I spend at least 20 hours a week in study and prayer to preach these services on top of a full-time job on top of being a husband and on top of being a father there are days the few days we get of sunshine where people get to go outside and they get to hike and they get to fish and they get to sit on the deck and read a book they get to wash their cars they get to go play soccer or hockey or baseball whatever it might be and guess where I am I'm stuck in the basement studying you think that I don't want to go out there I would love to be out there but guess what there's something else that God has ordained for me to do and so I do it but if I'm not careful I can start to resent and I can start to get grumpy and I can start to get prickly because I don't get to do what everybody else is doing today I've got to keep my mindset focus on the effect of what I'm doing rather than the feeling of what I'm doing amen if I'm focused on how I'm feeling church I'm going to fail most of the time cuz Satan's real good at at working with my emotions with our emotions but if I can focus on the purpose and the promise then I'm going to come through just fine amen Paul's talking about a place where we can resent people again where we can resent situations again see we think we've gotten past it but Satan will come up and he'll remind me of that time that brother Carson didn't shake my hand after church and pretty soon I start to think that brother Carson's got a problem with me because Satan is working to get me to resent something that I long forgave brother Carson for chance are brother Carson didn't ever do that in the first place and it wasn't a slight but see Satan's here to try and bring things back to get our mind and our emotions Twisted so that we start to resent the Believers around us church if we move past the situation don't go dig it up again but here's the thing if we haven't buried it then don't pretend we buried it either let's deal with it let's get it out in the open let's go brother to brother I'll go to brother Carson after church and say brother Carson you didn't shake my hand after service I I'm feeling resentful towards you brother I want to shake your hand I want to hug your neck and tell you I love and appreciate you that's the only thing that's going to get us past it amen remember we spoke in a service not too long ago about one of the greatest weapons brother Bram said was our willingness to commit something to God our willingness to lay it down and let God take over to lay down our rights to lay down our our offenses to lay down our emotions and all those things amen but if we've truly committed it to God we can't say I've committed it to God and then be angry we can't say I've committed it to God and then have a grumpy attitude we can't say I've committed it to God and now I'm prickly we can't say I've committed it to God and we go around and talk about it that is not the way that this works that's being entangled again in something you've got the victory over and Satan's trying to work in our minds and work in our midst to do these things entanglement is a tricky business if you've ever tried to hunt in New Finland you know I just got back from hunting a few weeks ago you tried going through those Alders and they're grown over you think you're getting through and then something grabs you from this side and something grabs you from that side and pretty soon your gun's being pulled off your shoulder and your hat's off your head and you lost a glove and you don't know where or how it happened cuz it's what entanglement these things are just pulling at you and pulling at you we have our own attitudes we have our own issues we have our own interactions with others amen and then we have the entanglements of past habits and ways of doing things we have the entanglements of plans don't we brother Vel where we thought this was how it was going to go and this is what we wanted to do do and then what does God do he comes in he says no but we can fall back on those plans if the feeling of our leadership and our our walk with God starts to go away we can have the entaglement of opportunities we've turned down I have had opportunities come my way and I prayed about it and I said no and you know what they keep coming back and I know it's not of God because I know the impact and what it would do to my family would do to my church life or due to my Ministry and so I say no no no but why do they keep coming back because Satan wants to entangle me and he wants to entangle you listen if you say no prayerfully and it keeps coming back that doesn't mean it's God that means Satan's persistent is what it means if you've made your decision based on the word of God he'll never change it he'll never change it he can't change it amen Satan's trying to get us to think about it rather than pray about it and he's trying to get us to read reason it rather than would see what the word says and the more time he works on you the weaker we tend to get if we don't stay in the word of God and if we don't stay in Fellowship amen you know when we look at our life I believe every single one of us has a predestinated walk amen we're ordained the Paul says we are ordained unto good works and this is just me you can take it or leave it I believe that God has waypoints in our life that are hard points they're embedded they do not move for someone like me it would be that I have a hard point and that I had to meet and Mary Blanca I had to get baptized and receive the Holy Ghost I had to become a minister so I could become a pastor those are hard points but between those points and again this is just me I believe there's a lot of variability I believe there's his perfect will and then I believe there's his permissive will and I believe the prophet taught that that we can do it his way or we can do it my way we can do it the easier way or we can do it the harder way and I'm just going to say the easier way becomes the harder way and the harder way becomes the easier way if we're looking at these things amen the path between those points is very much up to us we have choices remember what the the the the interpretation was given to brother bradam it says because you have chosen you've chosen the harder way and it is my way that means there was a other way and it was brother bram's way it was the fleshly way it was the easier way in that sense but he says because you've chosen my way the harder way a great portion of Heaven awaits you and this is a great Victory and love divine in these different things we have choices that we have to make and we've got to make sure they're clean they're not entangled brother Braham says it this way he says if you're a young woman dedicate your morals you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your mind dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all you are and let Christ work through that he says what a glorious thing you've got the rivers to cross you've got the bridges to go over you got the Brier patches you got the thickets you got the woods you got the Dark Places you got the high hills you got the high climbs he says what are you doing this life is not easy it's not all going to be fun in games he's saying if you get set yourself towards God the start you'll make it through he says someday you'll have to stand and look back and see where you come from and you're going to be judged by the course that you took he says put your all your mind and your thoughts on that North Star the center of God and don't move from it stay right with it it'll bring you straight like it did the Magi right straight to the Christ Church we choose chose whether it's going to be easy or whether it's going to be hard we can go God's way which is harder in the beginning but it's good at the end or we can go the way of the flesh which is Satan's way and it's easy at the beginning and it's hard at the end but one way or the other there's going to be hard days you want to go with the one that has a promise of benefit rather than a promise of death if we can put it that way Paul saying don't slip back don't dig up old situations don't dig up old habits don't dig up things you've gotten over don't dig up things that you've won the victory over keep going forward otherwise it's going to be bondage again and you're going to be back where you started in other words if you've been set free from something don't ever go back to it if the Holy Spirit has pulled you out if the word of God has called you out it will never draw you back in it would be contrary to itself that is not the way that God works amen the holy spirit will raise the standard of your life to match the word it will not put you back into the life that you used to have I've said this before you tell me why women that are professing Christians keep wearing less and less clothes and Tighter and Tighter clothes and they say I I'm allowed to do it well you might be allowed to do it but the holy spirit is not the one causing you to lower your standard you'll never see the Holy Spirit saying please go to that store and buy a shorter skirt than you've ever had buy a tighter skirt than you've ever had reveal more of your skin than you ever have that is not the working of the Holy Spirit it can't be God doesn't draw us out and then push us in again that's not the way it works I've shared this before with you there are certain apps that I don't use on my phone because God has shown me very clearly they're not good for my Ministry they're not good for for my family they're not good for my marriage they're not good for my mindset they're not good for my attitude I don't get involved with politics social media presence is minimal why because none of those things add to me they don't do a single good thing for me well maybe they do I can see where M I can see where there's uh camps going on and meetings going on and I can stay in in contact with some of the ministering Brethren and see what they're doing and some of these songs so maybe 1% of it is good and the rest of it is honestly a waste of time so I need to stay away from those things because they are time killers and they do nothing for me I don't have enough time as it is that's the last place I need to be so there are things that I don't have on my phone because God has shown me to stay away from those things and if God has has taken those things out of my life then who am I to add it back in because I think I can handle it guess what I can't handle it that's that's why he took it out that's why he took it out brother brah says it this way he says the salvation of Jesus Christ is not a hope so it's a noo you know when you are Christ the Holy Spirit Bears record with your spirit that you're Sons and Daughters of God old things have passed away and All Things become new that's the word that's the word all things have become new not a borderline Minister not a borderline Christian if the crowd's going this way you go with it that's not the way we ought to be he says if it goes that way you go with it no he says stay in the road stand in the Liberty where Christ has made you free he says be not entangled again in the Yoke of bondage or halfway God said it made him sick said I would you would be hot or cold for lukewarm he'd spit it from his mouth so God doesn't want a person that's just a professor without being a possessor of the blessings of God he says God grant the day hurries when Christians that profess to be Christians will be just what they profess to be God granted what's he saying entanglement is halfway living half in the world half out of the world dabbling in this coming to church dabbling in that coming to church you're set free and then now you're going back to it hey we've all got choices we absolutely have choices amen but it will be your choice to go back it will not be the leadership of the Holy Spirit to take us back when you've been delivered from something entanglement in it again is a personal choice it's a personal choice if God set you free and you knew you needed to be set free and you go back to it that is a personal choice you go back with your eyes wide open and it's on you then it's on you you were not fooled you walk back of your own free will Paul continues he says you did run well you were doing so well he says who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth Paul said you're seeing the results you're seeing the move of God you're seeing the works of the spirit in your life what happened what changed something changed remember I spoke of this not too long ago that that that if something has changed in our life it's usually because of a choice we've made if we're seeing a weakness if we're seeing a habit if we're seeing an attitude if we're seeing resentment or bitterness it's usually because we've elected to do something that we shouldn't have done it's a personal choice amen look at what Paul says he didn't say what did hinder you he said who remember there's only two sides there's Christ and there's everyone else so it wasn't Christ that hindered us so who must it be well it's got to be the influence of Satan Satan is the great influencer of this world we in Satan's kingdom we're not of it but we're in it and guess what this flesh is ATT tuned to to Satan's kingdom and this flesh is subject to the influence of Satan our souls are sealed by the Holy Spirit they're sealed to the day of our Redemption we cannot be lost but this body this flesh is absolutely attuned to listen to what Satan has coming our way and he's a master at putting things in front of us to entice us to entice our eyes to entice our mind to entice our bellies to entice our career to entice our intellectuality to entice our emotions to entice our need for influence recognition whatever it might be Satan's goal is to make us comfortable enough here that we're not trying to leave Satan's goal is to get us enjoying enough of life to keep the battle not so hard that we don't feel we need to get out of here that's his goal amen Paul would say this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you in other words it ain't God that's doing this work he says a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump you know what Satan's goal is it's to have us as part-time Christians parttime Christians where we can come to church and we can raise our hands and we can say Amen to the word we can attend Faithfully we can write our TI check and we can say I'm a Christian a Christian is a 247 job it's not a job it's a reality amen it ought to be Who We Are but Satan's goal is to get us to the place where we are half in and half out where we give in sometimes and we hold the line sometimes but that's not the purpose of a soldier halfway soldiers die and halfway athletes never win our goal is not to be halfway our goal is to be hot or cold never lukewarm Paul says it perfectly here a little bit of Leaven leavens the whole lump of dough Paul talked a lot about Grace because he was fighting a legalistic attitude and remember the Jews were always trying to go back to that law or try and hold on to some portion of that law and it was all dos and don'ts and Paul tried to get them out of the dos and don'ts but yet Paul came in and said there's things you ought to do and there's ways you ought to live and there's habits you ought to have but what we can get into under grace as we get into this idea of well I'm a legalist so I can do anything you want you absolutely can brother brah says I drink and I smoke as much as I want to which is not at all so the question is who's doing the wanting is it you or is it the Holy Spirit we've got to make sure it's the Holy Spirit that's leading us you know I have a scripture that's saved in my phone I'm going to share in a moment brother Joe shared this with me because we use this as a tactic with scammers that text us and when they text us we text them back this scripture and we underline the word thieves in the scripture we hope to save a soul someday but I want you to see how Paul keeps this this idea of Liberty and legalism in balance of dos and don'ts he says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves this is what we underline for scammers nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God he says and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Paul's point is you used to be like this God took you out of it why in the world are you going back to it in any form or fashion sometimes it's not the Habit it's the people around the Habit we've got to watch who we hang out with we've got to watch how we spend our time they were in yeah I mean you look at that list Church fornicators so out of wedlock intimacy idolators adulterers so married and cheating effeminate homosexuals abusers of themselves of mankind thieves Covetous drunks revilers these were bad people according to the law these are the people that can't go to heaven but he says you used to be this but the spirit of God washed you and it Sanctified you and it Justified you it did all of these things but watch this transition now because there's a place where we can take Liberty and we can turn it into a loophole to do what we want to do to do what this flesh wants to do what this Fallen nature wants and fall back it doesn't change our Soul's condition our soul is sealed but this flesh can be caught up in these things and watch what can happen Paul says this all things are lawful unto me he says every is permissible everything is allowable for me he says but all things are not what expedient all in other words all words or or all things don't profit me and all things don't benefit me I can do whatever I want he says but not everything's going to help me out he says all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any that word that phrase brought not under the power of any is actually a single word and it means mastered he says I will not be Mastered by anything in other words if I choose to do something then my choice must also allow me not to do it and so I am doing by choice and I am not doing by choice if I take up something and I can't lay it down I can't put it aside then guess what it has mastered me we can like it or we canot like it church this morning but if I can't lay it down then I have been Mastered by something other than the holy spirit in this flesh if I say I can give it up and yet I never put it down who's fooling who this guy this guy amen I'm back in bondage again the the the thing is when I looked up this word in the scripture all things are not expedient or sorry all things uh will not be brought under the power of any you know where it's used it's used to express the virtue of a woman's right to say no it's expressing the ability of a woman to reject a man's advances brother Brown listed three virtues of women one of them is the right to say no you get to choose who your partner is and here this is what Paul is saying you get to choose who your partner is you get to choose who's walking with day by day you get to choose the influences that are around you you get to choose the habits that are around you and he says when it's when you've been delivered from those things by God's grace don't ever go back to it leave it alone what God has clear you clearly shown you the answer is no to don't ever say yes to it's never going to be in his will Paul would set the standard here and he would say if you can control it and it does not affect your walk with God then it's between you and God but if it affects your walk with God your purpose in the kingdom of God then now it's not up to you it's not a personal choice that's him telling you no listen there are some things brother Paul can handle that I can't and there are some things I can handle that brother Paul can't there are personal leaderships based on strengths and weaknesses of this flesh has nothing to do with our souls it's purely a flesh matter purely a DNA matter amen and there are things that we ought not to have in our lives I've said before I like to use myself as an example I can't hang around car people a lot because I really enjoy cars and if I go to where they're racing them and where they're showing them and where they're modifying them and all of those things guess what I'll get caught up in it day to day I don't get caught up in it I don't think about cars all day long I don't have car magazines coming to the house I'm not reading up on them I still know a fair bit but it's not something I dwell on but if I focus on those things then guess what it gets the F the hooks into my flesh and pretty soon I'm looking on auto trader and Facebook Marketplace to see where I can get my next sports car it's not God leading me to do it that's John leading me to do it and it's a satanic influence in my life let me give you another example do I only read Christian books no I love historical fiction love it I've got book series on Julius Caesar The War of the Roses the Crusades uh gangas Conan all these things I love to read about it I so enjoy it and if it's clean guess what it's not a problem but the problem is if I'm reading novels instead of studying to preach guess what I'm under the master of the novel if I'm going home and reading my book rather than fellowshipping with the Saints I'm under the mastership of the novel if I'm reading the novel instead of reading my Bible in the morning for tions the novel has mastered brother John amen I've got three books on my nightstand right now and it'll take me six months to read them you know why because I have higher priorities and I might get 30 minutes at the end of the day to read something and that's about it why because it has no Mastery over me but I've got to be real careful because you can get sucked into it and pretty soon you're staying up till 12:30 at night and you're tired the next day and you're grumpy and these different things Mastery Church there's a liberty in the Holy Ghost where he sets us free from those things but it's a day-by-day battle cuz Satan is always fighting he's always presenting he's always giving us an opportunity the desire of our soul has changed but this flesh is unconverted that means there's a battle between soul and body Paul PA will talk about it this way he says for Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh that occasion means don't use it for an opportunity an entrance a starting point he's saying we have a choice don't use this for the flesh he says but by love serve one another if you go look at the original it doesn't say by love it says but by the Love This is aapo Love This Is The Love of the Holy Spirit this is not friendship this is Holy Ghost leadership love amen but by the love of the Holy Spirit serve one another so he's saying don't use Liberty for the flesh use Liberty to serve one another doesn't that take it into a whole different perspective Church doesn't that take the whole personal Liberty out of it he's saying if you've got freedom use it for the person next to you if you've got opportunity use it for the person next to you if you're allowed to do whatever you want want do it for the benefit of the brothers and sisters that are gathered around you Paul takes all the selfishness out of Liberty Paul takes all the personal rights out of Liberty and he says whatever Liberty you've got use it for somebody else we're talking about Liberty O lools Paul's saying you can make a personal choice here and you have a personal choice how you use your free time how you use your free money how you use your free energy how you use your mind how you use the skills God's given you and they're all an opportunity for you to either help yourself or help others so many professing Christians today we're trying to walk with God and keep ourselves safe we're trying to walk with God keep ourselves comfortable trying to walk with God stay pick our own entertainment and music trying to walk with God always feel secure try and walk with God and do things my way because that's what Satan's trying to get us to do hold on to some semblance of control and power that's not a walk with God church that's a ride in my car with Satan sitting shotgun and God coming up to my door from time to time when I ask him for something we want to have our cake in need it too we want to have enough of God's will in our life that we feel secure but enough control of our own pathway that we feel we have some input that's not the way of the believer never has been Jesus said take up your cross this is not a walk in the park it's not easy it's not always fun this flesh will not find it enjoyable amen hey let me put it bluntly for this walk Jonathan klette can't come out the other end he's got to die this guy has to die he has to die in this walk with God CU in the end the only thing that can come out is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the only goal we ought to have is Let Jesus be seen let this one die amen listen I've got to start it with him but he's got to finish it and it's got to be all him and none of me by the end of it look what Jesus said he said If any man will come after me let him deny himself you've got Liberty you got a choice he says let him deny himself take up his cross uhoh no daily really daily take up his cross daily and follow me not lead me not tell me what to do follow me there's a choice and it's a daily Choice it's a daily walk not just Wednesday nights not just s Sunday mornings it's not a part-time Christianity it's an all day everyday Christianity he says for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake the same shall save it brother Bram says this he says you stay with the word and it makes it power Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and for forever Jesus said in St John 14:12 he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also and if he abide in me and my word in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you he says what is it you've got to get with the word and get yourself killed out he says I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything that's a starting place he says but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking and he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in God till his word just living right through you he says you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life my words are life said Jesus we are not to rely upon human reasonings Proverbs the 3r chapter the 5ifth verse said lean not on the upon thine own understanding don't do it no matter what God's word seems like you say well it seems it's just as good this way that isn't what it is it's God's word take it the way he said it We Believe It Or we don't believe it he said God said so let's stay with it he's he's drawing a line church either we believe or we don't James said show me your faith by your Works show me what you believe by how you act if we say we believe it and we don't do it then do we really believe it we were fellowshipping the other day again with brother Vel sister Becky and he was talking you know how how a particular Indian religion over there they don't believe in Kill anything really they don't believe in in eating animals they don't believe in you can't kill a spider or a bug or anything and my wife said well what if you get termites in your house and he said well in that case we would have to kill the termites and of course me being me I said that seems pretty hypocritical to me he said well it's an existential problem it's them or us and so we choose us we don't enjoy it but we choose us and and the thing that came to me by God's grace is I stopped and I said do we ever do that see we're not here to point fingers we're here to point fingers and say do I suffer from this problem and so we started to talk about this and I said do we as as Christians do we stand on a principle of the word and then lay the principle down when things get too uncomfortable when things get too personal when they start to impact our life our finances our health our relationship our family and unfortunately the qu the answer we came up with our testimony was yes not you you say well for us the answer was yes and we started talking about it not always yes but occasionally yes we lay down the word for the sake of ourselves for our comfort for whatever it might be and the only way we do that church is if we stop believing in the full effect of the word that's the only reason we'd ever go against it is we don't feel the word is going to do what the word says we started talking about Daniel when he went to Babylon and when Daniel went to Babylon he did not go as a free man he went as a captive to the king's table he was part of the royal household in in Israel he was one of the the greatest young men he had Prestige he had education he'd been taught the word of God but now he's a slave in Babylon he has no expectation of being able to worship God the way to live the life that he was taught to live he had no expectation of them respecting his religion or them recognizing his God but yet it says in Daniel chapter 1 yet but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself in other words Daniel established one principle whatever I can do to stay with the word I'm going to stay with the word Daniel couldn't celebrate the feasts Daniel couldn't go to the temple but what Daniel could do is keep himself from what the King was offering so where he truly had control he purpose in his heart I'm going to maintain control I'm going to stay with the word of God church if we're looking for loopholes we can find them if you if you're in Daniel's position all the loopholes you're looking for to say there's no way I can serve God way I ought to Daniel could have went and the three Hebrew children with them could have went the way of all the thousands of others that came over cuz what did they take they took the loophole they said we don't have a choice we're captives we're slaves who are we to tell them what we're going to do we can come to a place where our finances are threatened where our retirement's threatened where our job is threatened our career is threatened where our grades are threatened where our health is threatened and we back down and we say far enough I've taken the word this far I'm not going any further and we back down and we let circumstances and situations push us back Daniel didn't allow that Daniel said I'm not moving I'm not moving but in in fellowshipping around this question we are talking about where do we tend to fold like a cheap lawn chair and it's almost always around finances work and family cuz family's personal and there's a natural connection there we all need money and the job is the way to get it and so that's where we tend to fall down we'll do whatever it takes to preserve our income because we need money to live we'll do whatever it takes to preserve health because we need to be healthy amen and we'll skip our family time we'll skip our church time we'll skip our devotions time we'll skip all sorts of things but we won't skip work why because I need my money brother Matt was talking to me before service he attributed this to brother Gerald saying it maybe he did I don't know I don't I wasn't here for it but he said don't push your Ox in the ditch on Saturday so you can get it out on Sunday see too many times we're willing to sacrifice our time with God but not our time for our family Saturday is my day off I'll do my work on Sunday I'm not trying to be extreme here we need money to survive but Jesus said seek ye first first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you you talk about the lies he say look if he if he takes care of the lies if he takes care of The Sparrows how much more are you his children but we've got to let the word stand for us rather than our will and our way in these different things we've got a word promise that's fighting for preeminence against our employer demands against our financial requirements against our family expectations and the only way we can get a word promise is if we stay with it if we stand therefore in the Liberty where Christ has set you free He Set You Free from trying to do it yourself so that you could stand on the word and let him do it for you so that you'd have a promise to stand on rather than your own skills your own reputation your own work ethic your own whatever it might be and now we can stand on a word that never fails cuz guess what I'll fail every time and you will to eventually you notice here Daniel never insisted what Daniel said is Lord I'm going to do what I can do and so Daniel went and in faith he asked it says he requested can I not eat the food can I hold myself apart I'm a Christian you see I can't do these sorts of things but here's what I can do will you give me some some favor see too many times we don't want to explain why and so we just bend over Daniel said I'm a Believer I can't eat this type of food here's the kind of food I can eat it's cheaper it's easier it's readily available if you'll give me this then see how it works out for you and after 10 days what did they find that he was healthier he was smarter he was brighter and so were the three Hebrew children and so they continue to let them live according to the dictates of their heart we've told the story many times brother codre digs talks tells it about that young man that was living in a town and he had a great job with a great employer good paying in a place where good paying jobs were hard to come by and they called him into the office and they and they said we're changing your shift from a day shift to a night shift you'll have to work evenings now 5 days a week and he said that's fine but I can't work on Wednesdays cuz I go to church on Wednesdays and they said we're sorry but it's all the nights or or we'd have to let you go now Church here's the thing they thought they had him over the barrel but he's a Son of God this world never has us over a barrel and he said then you can f me because I go to church on Wednesday nights but here's the thing Church he's a Son of God he's the best worker they've got they can't afford to lose him but Satan was trying to make him think you've got no choice and he said I've got a choice I'm a Child of God my God my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills what am I worried about he says you're going to have to fire me you know what they did they sheepishly came back to him and they said uh what time does your church start he says you know 7:00 but I need to be there 30 minutes beforehand so 6:30 they said how long does it take uh it takes me about 30 minutes okay so they said you got to leave by 600 he said yes he said they said what time do you have to be back he says no no no no I'll I I don't know it changes constantly cuz they were trying to lock him down he says I'm not locking down I'm going to stay in church as long as church is open so what in the end what they did is they said listen when it's time for you to go to church you go to church don't clock out don't tell anybody just go to church and when church is done you come back and work again and in the end he got paid to go to church in perpetuity because he refused to bow down to the circumstance he knew he was a child of God and he stood on the word and he said though it hurt my family though it hurt my bank account though it caused me some pain I'm going to stand here because as a child of God I'd rather have him than anything you could offer me church that's the Liberty we're talking about out he could have taken the loophole I got a mortgage to pay I got insurance to pay I got a car to pay down but he said no I've got a Rapture to make I've got a body to support I've got a word that's been hand prepared for me every service I ain't missing it and he said I'm going to take God's way and in the end they had to come in line with the word because he stayed in the path that God had showed him that's the Liberty we have this morning church you cannot outgive God you can't out trust God you can't out bless God he has no unpaid debts no unpaid debts amen whether it's Daniel or this brother in this story there's one thing they knew they knew where power was remember what Jesus said he's standing before Pilate pilate says don't you know that I have power to kill you to crucify you or set you free and Jesus says oh no you only have power if it's given to you from from above he wasn't cowed why because he knew you can't touch me unless God allowed it it's no different for us listen God can bless you above what you can never ask or think if you'll stay with him brah says if we stayed close to God and loved him and just kept living for him and not trying to push things over not trying to make it happen not trying to force it he says just live for God and live a pure holy life and live and pray every day keep yourself refreshed in his presence God will take care of the rest of it he will adopt the people into his own beloved body the church and when the Rapture comes you'll be found without a blemish because you're living in the presence of the King Church I'm here to say this morning it's time we started recognizing the Liberty that Christ has given us that when we stay with the word when we stay in his presence when we give him the preeminence there's nothing he won't do for us amen our Liberty is resting completely in what he said not in what I've determined not in what I can do listen some of us have enough gifts to make things happen to a certain level but I'll tell you when I've stayed with God he's done he's given me favor Beyond favor he's given me opportunity Beyond opportunity and he's met my every need and isn't that really what we're here for I'm not here for my wants I'm here for my needs cuz that's what he promised every need supplied that's what we're trusting in I don't have to have a mansion I think by age I've got the oldest vehicles in the church but guess what they keep on ticking we're good with it we're not here for wants we're here to make a Rapture we're here to get out of this life amen not here to have a fun and enjoyable life as much as that is nice to have from time to time hey I enjoyed getting a week off of studying every single night almost that was a nice break for me but guess what funny thing is you only get so much of a break and then things start coming in and you got to go down you got to start writing it down anyways you can't get away from who you are you can't get away from who you are as a Believer you try and take a break and guess what God will still work on you God will work on you whether you're you're skiing whether you're snowmobiling or ice fishing or sitting down by your fire reading a book God's going to keep working with us one way amen but we can't get a testimony if we keep backing down at some point we've got to stand up stand therefore in the Liberty that he's given us by his word and say I'm not moving I'm not moving do what you want say what you want do your worst I'm going to stand here because I'm looking for the testimony of the word in my life you know what Satan does Satan's a magnifier he magnifies your flaws to yourself and he magnifies your flaws to me oh every one of us has flaws even our elders even even our venerable Pastor brother Gerald he has flaws from the oldest to the youngest we've got flaws Satan magnifies the situation and he says what if what's going to happen if you don't do what they want you to do what's going to happen if you don't work the way they want to work what's going to happen if you don't study the way they want you to study what's going to happen if you say the things they don't want you to say there's consequences but there's good consequences too because faith comes behind and faith says not what if when when God backs up his word when God does what he said and what does it do it points us to the grace of God it points us to the blood of Jesus Christ it points us to the power of the Holy Spirit bringing this word to a reality in our life and says how are you going to feel then when he does what he promised to do his promise was I'll never leave you or forsake you and if you'll confess me before men I'll confess you before my Father in Heaven says it this way we're getting close he says times may be hard God has not promised a flowery bed of ease but but's usually a bad thing this is a great thing he says but he has promised Grace sufficient for every trial that can hit you that's right yes indeed grace is sufficient not on a flowery bed of ease but he has promised Grace to overcome in every Temptation when a cross gets heavy Christ promised to be with you Church we've got a fully open word we in the end time of end times it's time we stop making excuses there is no reason to make an excuse for why we can't live by the word this morning time we stop giving our reasons it's time we start just saying Lord let your word do what it says it will do let me stay with it and let him sort out the details Paul says for all the laww remember he said use your Liberty for occasion to serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so if we're going to be legalistic about one thing this is it love your brother and sister the way you love yourself treat your brother and sister the way you treat yourself give Grace to your brother and sister the way that you receive Grace give them the benefit of the doubt the way you hope that they're giving you amen he says but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another he's saying if you're going to use that Liberty for yourself watch out because it'll turn you against the people that are around you and you'll destroy the Fellowship of the Saints in your Liberty because you're looking for loopholes to think feel and act the way you want to he says this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh Paul's Paul's emphasizing one thing here if you're led by the spirit the flesh ain't G to like it I'm full of good news this morning aren't I get ready for the flesh not to like this it's impossible to be H having your fleshly desire satisfied and be led by the spirit he says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would remember what Paul said in Romans 7 he says when I would do good evil is present there's always this budding heads between what's in your soul and what's in your flesh and it's a constant battle he says but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law he says now the works of the flesh are made manifest catch this now the flesh has works the spirit has fruit the flesh you can see what's going on the spirit you can't all you see is what it's done he says he says the works of the flesh are manifest which are these okay this is what he's talking about to Believers now professing Believers adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness and we all said we don't do that we're good everybody's good this morning right no adulterers here or the Kings these nodding we're good all right let's move on to the next one idolatry do we have any idolators here this morning oh I I think we might remember it's not bowing down to ba or mik or Kosh it's putting anything ahead of God's word but listen to this remember what Samuel said he says stubbornness is viewed the same as idolatry by God now do we have any stubborn people this morning hey I'm stubborn aren't I Blanca she not I'm stubborn guess what it has to die it has to die see we read these scriptures and we put it on everybody else I'm trying to put you in there with me not to make us bad to set us free if we can't see we're entangled how can we be set free my way or the highway line up behind me let's get set free this morning let's move on to witchcraft any witches or Wizards here this morning Samuel said Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft in God's eyes what is rebellion refusing to follow the leadership of God I have a feeling we've all done that maybe not today maybe not yesterday but at some point we stop short or what do we do we do what he said plus or minus just a little bit and that was Saul's failing was he would only go so far with God's will hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions we would never do these things what about heresies any Heretics this morning Heretics are groups of people with similar opinions and ideas it's not about the word it's about what they think and you can have groups of people inside a church inside this message that have a way that they think and they preach it a certain way and they do it a certain way and if you don't believe it their way then you're out what are they Heretics because it's about them it's not about the word it's about their portion of the word word that they picked rather than the entire word Heretics envin my we would never have that in a church absolutely why does so- and so get to do this why does so and so have this why do they have a bigger house why do they have a nicer car why do they have a better job why they have a prettier wife why do they always get this why do I always get that envyings murders brother Braham says you can murder a man's character and never touch him drunkenness I pray to God we don't have drunkenness revelings and such like of the which I tell you before as I've also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God it's all works of the flesh it's under the influence of a who and that who is Satan amen Paul's making it clear you can't be led by the Holy Spirit and be doing these things but watch this he says but the fruit of the spirit remember the flesh is a doer the spirit is a producer the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such he says there is no law in other words you can't have too much of this you can't have too much love you can have too much filio love you can love your children too much where you don't correct them but this is not when it says love there it is not filio it is agapo that's Holy Spirit love which covers the whole gamut of these things amen you can have never too much of AG goppo love you can never be too patient you can never be too faithful you can never be too Meek you can never deal with somebody too much cuz God's longsuffering with us and if that's the way he is with us that's the way we need to be with each other what's Paul saying he's saying your Liberty is letting him produce himself in you letting God do what he said he was going to do it's a letting go and letting God have his way rather than a holding on and having my way that's what this produces he says and they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust crucifixion was considered the most agonizing death and guess what church we're in the same place this body has to die an agonizing slow death and with it my thoughts and my opinions and my preferences and my rights and my emotions and all those things and guess what it's every single day it happens crucifixion takes time to die and it ain't no fun but he says we do it we choose it we put ourselves here we crucify the affections and the us and he says if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit he says if we're saying we are alive by the Holy Spirit if we're saying we have the new birth then our eyes ought to reflect the life that's in us because if it's these other things and not the fruit of the spirit then something else has entangled us and we've lost the picture somewhere as we start to close this morning I've been a little long I've got a one scripture and a set of quotes I want to share with you and so often we preach really with the expectation that nobody's here nobody's dealing with this nobody's suffering from this but what if we have been entangled what if we're sitting here this morning and we're tied up in our emotions we're tied up in bitterness we're tied up in a habit that we thought we kicked we're tied up in a relationship we're tied up in friendships we we're we're caught in something that we used to not be caught up in what happens then because Satan will magnify that and he'll try and turn it into a place where you think you're lost and you think you can't get out and you think you're not a child of God once Satan gets a Toe Hold or a foothold or a stronghold his purpose is to make you think you can never get him out once he's in but that ain't true but he'll try and make us think that amen but the holy spirit's here by the word of God to say no you can go free there's always a path made for you watch what David said David said where shall I go from your spirit and where shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me I'm never going to come out it's too dark it's too far I'm too deep into it he says even the night shall be light about me you know I love the fact David had a heart after God's Own Heart the desires of David were the same as the desires of God and yet David had his down times he had his failures he had his failings amen David himself had many times where he felt lost forsaken forgotten wondering why do the Heathen Prosper why are they having it so good Lord you look at their life and they're not doing what I'm doing David had moments of total and abject compromise and surrender David went to the Philistines David went to the country and the people that he had defeated himself what for Comfort he was tired of being chased by his own people and so he went to their enemy and he tried to get Comfort there and what did he reap he reaped a whirlwind he never got what he was looking for David's reality was that God was always with him but David's feeling was that God had forsaken him so many times and it got so things got so tight and he got so tightly wound and he couldn't release it and so he took matters into his own hands and rather than relying on the promise of God he relied on his own two feet and he took himself to a place of comfort and it did nothing for him and it took God's grace to get him out but God got him out not without some moments of angst and worry that's for sure as he comes back to his home and finds his wife and children and those of his men gone and they've got to chase after them and get them back but God gave him a promise I'll get them back for you but this was your doing David don't ever forget this don't walk away from my promise and my word I'm saving you but don't ever do it again but if you're caught up this morning listen it could be a big thing it can be a little thing Church you look at your own life this morning but don't let Satan tell you you can't come back don't let Satan tell you you can't win you can't be set free see we think God did it once and that's all he's obligated to do no God's obligated to his word and if you're a part of it he'll keep moving until you're out of it that's the promise of God maybe you're weary maybe you're wondering maybe you're frustrated listen to this this person asked brother Brown they say I have lived many years in sin until I found the Lord praise the Lord then they say I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored whole again this person has gotten reang they've been entangled again in a yoke of bondage they've gone back to where they were and Satan has bound them and they don't think they can be returned brother Ram says yes you have not sinned my friend so far in God but what you could be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you'd never want to be restored but as long as there is something dealing with your heart you're still in line of restoration and then he says these words he puts us all on the same Level Church guilty of the least is guilty of the whole I have sinned many times every day every one of us do things that we don't want to do that ought to keep us so so humble if the prophet of God can say it I ought to be able to say it as well every day we do we think we act on things that we ought not to he says there is a place where you can cross where you can't get back but when that is but when that is you're down there again in the same shape you were it goes to show that you only Fell From Grace he says backsliding is not lost I wanted somebody to tell me where backsliding is lost and prove it to the Bible he says a backslider is is not lost he's just out of Fellowship he says Israel backslid but they never lost their Covenant they lost their praises and joy David lost the joy of his salvation when he took bash Sheba uriah's wife but he never lost his salvation he never said restore to me my salvation he said restore to me the joy of my salvation he says oh there's so much of this legalism today the touch not taste not he says you don't do things legally he says you may think you're tied down brother sister that wrote this question you may think the devil has got you tied down there but he's lying there was one time a man came to Earth Jesus Christ the son of God and he untied you don't you believe it you don't have to stay down there no sir you're free he died in your place to take away your sins you just believe on him flop your wings and fly away with the rest of them don't stay in that pit of the devil it's still a choice there's still a liberty but we've got to walk in it a loophole might have taken us down but it's a choice of Liberty that'll take us back up again and then this person says I have fallen I am sinned I'm dead wrong church are all the words of somebody that doesn't know who they are that's the words of somebody that knows exactly who they are they said is there a chance for me to be whole again he says Absol absolutely the minute you desire it that shows that God dropped the lifeline down to pick you up just rise up on his Lifeline of faith and prayer and move right on up amen God bless you this morning let's stand if we would musicians can come this is down where we live it's not an easy service to preach but my point is not to drag us down down the point is to open our eyes help us to be honest with ourselves help us to be honest with where we are where our walk with God is to look at the things we're doing look at the things we're not doing and say Lord has something entangled me and am I using my Liberty to put myself right back into bondage again or am I living in the liberty of the Holy Ghost where we stay free and we live free in the presence of God Amen you got an issue this morning he can set you free but you've got to be able to say I've got an issue this person said I have fallen I am sinned and I'm dead wrong that's the honesty God's looking for Lord I made the wrong decision I've walked the wrong way I've let something back in I've gone back and I put the shackles on again and Lord now I need you to free me again that's what it takes this morning is to say I've been entangled in the Yol of bondage but I'm coming for the liberty of Christ this morning amen I'm here to warn you Satan is going around as a roaring lion trying to devour you young people guard your life if he set you free don't walk back and if he's kept you from it in the first place don't go try it out amen it'll bind you it's bound better and stronger people than you there are mature Christians walking around this Earth today Bound in things because they won't say I've fallen I've tripped up I'm tangled in things that I can't break out of and it's going to take a move of God it's going to take the spirit of God to set them free amen I believe he's here this morning to set us free if we need it let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord your word says He Who the sun sets free is free indeed lord it's a perfect work it's a complete work it's a finished work and Lord we're here for a total word experience this morning Lord God lord I raise my hands this morning Lord you see my faults and my shortcomings Lord you see my failings Lord you see the lives of every believer

morning Lord I pray you forgive us Lord that we can confess we have fallen Lord but we're asking you to raise us up this morning Lord where we've made wrong decisions Lord where we've walked 99% of the way and then turn back lord I pray you help us to go that last 1% Lord help us to take you at your complete word so we can have a whole word experience Lord God lord I pray you restore us this morning Lord You're a redeemer you're a restorer Lord your purpose is to bring us back to you Lord I pray we'd not walk away by choice this morning Lord but that we'd come willingly to you in Jesus
