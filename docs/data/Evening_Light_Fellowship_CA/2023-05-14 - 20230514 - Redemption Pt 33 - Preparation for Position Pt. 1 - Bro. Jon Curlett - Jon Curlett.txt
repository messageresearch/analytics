Lord but when we walk out Lord that we will be a true reflection of Jesus Christ to this Lord dark and sinful World Lord that we would draw people not to us nor would that we draw them to you Lord the

Lord our faith Lord our Grace our Mercy our love our joy Lord may you just take us into Greater Heights and deeper depths Lord as your word has promised us this morning we pray Lord remembering those

your hand just be upon her your presence in that room Lord it may be a testimony to the doctors of your grace in our life we pray Lord just bless us now here we ask in Jesus Christ's name and God bless you if you would turn to Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter one welcome each one here our visitor at the back there as well amen Roy it's good to see you amen and God bless the mothers today amen those that are those that will be amen prophet of God said that they are the backbone of the nation he said and when they attacked motherhood and when they took it away he said they broke the nation's Spirit that's how important a mother is amen so we praise the God we praise God for Holy Ghost filled Godly women amen that can raise their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord I mean I believe each one that's here is a product in part of a good mother amen that God has granted us those Grace that Grace to be raised in a home most of us with a father as well hopefully that that believes in trusts in the Lord Jesus Christ amen but we're thankful from others that have been faithful and today a mother is not very respected the way they used to be they they're more respected for their jobs and what they do out in the world and they're trying to get them away from it and give their children over to other people to raise men you'll never find in the scripture where where it it shows those sort of things for a mother to back away from those situations but she's supposed to stay with it amen so we're blessed to those that have been able to do it and and have given their lives literally given their lives for for us to raise us as children amen I just wanted to make a a quick announcement here so if you have an emergency my phone goes to do not disturb at 10 pm every night so moving forward of course if you've got a need if there's an emergency that arises to get a hold of me if you text me or call me after 10 pm I won't know because I unless I've got my phone in my hand and look at it I won't know but what you have to do is you have to call me twice within two minutes and it'll go through on the second call if you call me within that two minute period so I've had people call me and say brother John I need prayer I've got a situation or whatnot late at night in the middle of the night you can call me whenever but you have to call me twice and it'll go through on the second call and then I'll pick up and I'll be able to to work with you okay so just wanted to let you know that otherwise there's people from all the way on the west coast and they're texting me at 12 and 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning I can't have my phone on because it'll wake me up through the night but it's it's there and I've got it set now so that the local body in particular can call me and just call me twice within the space of two minutes and I'll be able to to answer your call no matter what time of day it is amen amen God bless you Ephesians 1 and verse 5. very familiar scripture No Doubt says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're we're finally stepping into the last portion of this series on Redemption and and I've been talking about adoption and and what not again like he have kept pointing forward to it well now we're here now we're in the Final Phase so if you've been enjoying it then then we've got a little ways to go and if you wish I'd just move on then we'll be moving on shortly as well so one way or the other it should be good amen but we're going to spend some some time on this because we're at the end of the Gentile dispensation we're at the end of God God's plan for the Gentiles before he turns back to the Jews and that means he's got to wrap everything up and that means that as the scripture talks about there is a final manifestation of the of the sons of God so I want to take for a title this morning we're in in Redemption as I said but I want to talk about preparation for position amen preparation for position and and we know that as God is wrapping things up that that elect lady that bride of Jesus Christ those ones that were chosen from the foundation of the world from before the foundation of the world that he's got a final move that he does with that last age bride and she will be just like they had in the book of Acts Prophet God tells us that if there's another Vine that if it puts forth another Branch she'll do the same work she'll put forth a second book of Acts amen not a book of beliefs remember it's called the book of The Acts of the Apostles not the book of the beliefs of the Apostles amen at some point our beliefs have to be put into action amen there has to be a reflection in our day-to-day life of the decisions we make of the of the way we spend our time of the way we spend our energy that it reflects what we believe that we would be not hearers only but that we would be doers also amen we'll get into that a little bit later and I know that for many of us certainly the older ones no doubt they've heard this many times before but just the way that I've got to do it I've got to start from the bottom and build us up so for the older ones maybe hold on and and just get here but the younger ones maybe haven't heard this and and haven't had it taught to them so I'll be teaching more this morning rather than preaching probably but just to set a foundation of of what it means we talked here in Ephesians 1 about the adoption of children and I want to go through that adoption process over the next few Services because that word adoption means something quite different today than it meant back then because today when we talk about adoption it talks about bringing somebody that's not in your family into the family but the the adoption process in those days was was quite a bit different and and sometimes we forget that the Bible is an Eastern book it's not a western book it's not an American book it's not a Canadian book it's a western it's an Eastern book and so we have to look at it through the eyes of the Eastern world and their traditions and that's how we we start to understand these things and and what adoption really is so in Galatians 4 Paul says Paul says this he says now I say that the air as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be the Lord of all but he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father and he's pointing to what this adoption process looks like and what he's saying here is he says is that the in order to be adopted you had to be a member of the family see here in North America to be adopted you can't be a member of the family but if we started with it with this in the scriptures if adoption was only for somebody that was born into the family as a son in other words you got it because of who you were in the family they couldn't add to it they couldn't take away from it but if you were a part of the family then you were able to go through this process of adoption amen so it was a reflection of their bloodline it was a reflection of their origin it was a reflection of who their father was That's What mattered most was not who you were but who your father was that's what allowed you to come into this adoption process amen so this this idea of adoption the Scripture it doesn't mean it the way we think but it's rather putting someone into a position of responsibility it would be called the placing of a son and it was put into a position of responsibility so not just you are my son but he puts you into the family business he puts you into what matters to the family you take on things that matter to the father and the family and you take those responsibilities on because he knows that you're ready to to take those things on Amen so I want you to understand that adoption is not because you did something in and of yourself and it's no different for us as children of God you don't have adoption because you went out and earned a place that would do it you've got to earn it in a way but you're given the opportunity because you are a child of God and that was before you ever did anything before you ever chose God before you ever took a step towards God he has already put a place there for you and we read in Ephesians 5 there where he says that he has showed us the mystery of his will and the Mystery of his will is how you fit into the family of God what you're supposed to do with your life and so each one that is born has a place that they must fit because God doesn't have children for the sake of children today maybe what happens is is that that a husband and wife have children because they want intimacy because they want pleasure but God doesn't do it that way God has children for purpose and it is for the use and the kingdom of God he's got a place exactly prepared for them and he's got a path prepared for them specifically to take them to where he wants them to be that's where this adoption process looks like amen it's because you are a child of God because you're a part of the family of God because he chose you before the foundation of the world that's why you're going to be adopted amen now I as we read here in Galatians 4 Paul is saying here he says that the air so the one that's going to inherit everything that the father has the one that's going to get all of his money all of his property all of his business all of these things he says that son starts out no different than a servant in other words his authority his responsibility what he is allowed to do with with the father's things and and whatnot all of that he says he starts out no different than a servant because why he's just a child and when you're our child you think as a child you act as a child you do as a child but there has to come a day where you become a man and you put away childish things but as long as you're a child then the father can't use you as long as you think and act as a child then the father can't use you so he's got to put you through a process until you're shown yourself worthy to take over or to step up next to the father and do the work that he has for you so what did he do because he starts as a child at this level and he wants to raise him not just to a man because a man you can look at him and say he's a man but he's got to be a man that's worthy that is similar that is the same as the father so that he can do the father's work and so he's got to take him from here all the way up to here and how does he do it in verse 2 it says that he put him under tutors and governors until the time appointed of whom the father so it wasn't the son that could say Lord I'm ready Daddy I'm ready but the father had to say son you're ready we don't determine when we're ready for God to use us God determines when we're ready for God to use us and we'll sit and we'll sit and he'll work in her work until we get to the place that he sees himself in us and then he'll put us into action but until that time we've got to suffer through the tutors and Governor's stage of our life before God is ready for us Prophet God puts it this way he says for when a man owned a great big place so nice a big farm he had many tenants all all around over this place and he was a busy man he had to go from place to place and then when a son was born in his house they didn't have such things as we have today public schools and so forth they didn't have it in those days they had to hire tutors to raise their children now he says when a son was born he was born he was a son as soon as he was born you're a child of God before you ever realize it when that son came out of his mother's womb he didn't know he was a son but yet he was a son nonetheless but that's only the start of this he was a born son to that home but yet he didn't have any inheritance until he came to a place he'd what proved himself a son how does your son how does your daughter prove that she is your son or daughter she acts like you she talks like you she does these things and it's so funny as you see your children grow and they start to mimic mommy and daddy and you start saying well that's just like me or that's just like you and you see those things reflected and you say they really are my son they really are my daughter you knew they were but you see it in their actions you see it in the words they say in the things they do and you say huh there it is there's my half in there he says he he came to a place where he proved himself a son and then when he was proved to be a son then he was adopted into the family and the law of adoption made him what an equal holder with his father remember scripture says Jesus said in that day you'll ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it that's what adoption looks like is when you speak it and God does it because why your name on the check is as good as his but you don't just get that because you are a son you do not just get that because you are a daughter of God but you get it because you proved you know how to use what's in the bank account for the kingdom of God's purpose not just your own and we'll talk about that in a little bit amen so the father committed the training and the teaching and the proving of a son to trusted Tutors or Governors and they would be directed by what the will of the son did the son get to say I want to be an accountant or I want to be a Rancher or I want to be a machinist or I want to be an engineer I want to be a teacher no the father chose what the son's role was going to be because he knew what was required in his business in his land and in his property and if you didn't do what the father said you couldn't inherit what the father had so you are born into a family to take what the father had already provided for you that what he had built up in these different things amen so maybe if the father was a Rancher and he was surrounded by by desert lands and maybe he was on the border of the Philistines or whatnot then he would have to teach his son a certain way his son would have to be a man that could handle war that could handle cattle rustlers and bandits and he'd have to know what it was like to go out and track men down or guard against them in these different things so the Rancher would maybe bring in an old army Sergeant that was tough and hard as nails to toughen his son up because he was going to have to spend days and weeks out in the out in the fields and out in in the pastures and out in the desert checking on things and tidying things up and he'd have to sleep on hard ground and he'd have to eat beans and and black coffee and beef steaks all the time and he'd have to be a man that could handle the rigors of outdoor life and these different things so he'd have to hire a tutor that matched the end goal or the end purpose of his child of his son but then maybe another guy had a manufacturing business and he didn't need a son that could wield a sword or throw a spear could hunt down cattle rustlers he needed a guy that could maybe fix the equipment like brother Matt you know a machinist or something like that or maybe he needed a man that could develop contracts and and develop a supply chain and bring things in and turn them into better things maybe he needed a son that could handle the books and so he'd have them there and he'd have an accountant train his son into how to run a business you know again the sun was trained based on what the father determined was needed not on what the sun determined what was needed and so the training was a reflection of his final position now if you took those two boys one the son of a Rancher and won the son of maybe a manufacturing or production company and you put the two of them together and they start talking to each other and maybe the the the son that's sitting at the desk he says to the other guy says what did you do today the guy says I learned six ways how to kill a Cattle Rustler while riding my horse and at that accountant boy would be sitting there and saying well all I learned how to do was was to make the financial statements for the company for at your end sitting at my desk and he'd go back and he'd say to his dad how come he gets to ride horses and and swing swords and I'm sitting here at a desk and the father would say because you're not called to kill cattle rustlers you're not called to to sit out there and sleep on the ground and have ants all over you when you wake up in the morning and scorpions in your boots you're called to run a business differently than what he's called to run but if those Sons started talking and one of them would say I want what he's got them what would happen maybe on the side he'd go out and he'd learn how to how to fight and learn how to swing a sword to get away from the father sings and he'd get what he'd get in a place where he wasn't satisfied with what the father had called him to do and he'd start learning something that had no benefit to him or the father's business and he'd have wasted all that time why am I saying this sometimes we look around and we say how come they get to do that how come they get to do that how come they have this and I don't have this and what it is is God has it prepared each and every one of us for a certain place in a certain position in the Kingdom I saw something I was reading somebody had attributed a quote to Michelangelo and I looked it up and I don't know that he said it but one thing he did say he said he said people want to be a master but if they saw how hard it was to become a master none of them would want it if you understood what it took to become certain things in the body of Christ you'd never ask for it we had a Prophet come in this age and it was an open book and we got to see him tell about all the mistakes he made and the troubles that God put them through and the discipline that he went through and the judgments of God on his life because what he refused to obey at Key moments of his life and he was honest enough he was Frank enough to tell us don't disobey because it's painful it's hard because God takes a man or God takes a woman and as he prepares them he's breaking them down and molding them into what they're supposed to be and as long as we resist we can't be molded as long as we resist we can't be molded and so he's looking for people that will what stop resisting and surrender and say Lord you know what you want out of me Father you know what what you want out of me and I'm willing to surrender my life to do it amen when I was called to the ministry it was the last thing I wanted I've shared this publicly many times because why I had a lot of Pride I had a lot of self-confidence I had a lot of belief in myself and that's the kind of thing that kills behind a Pulpit it kills behind a Pulpit if you think you can get up here and get up and preach because of what you know or because of the revelations you have or this that and the other thing that is not it you've got to be able to catch the mind of God for the people for that service day in and day out and it has nothing to do with what you want to say or what you know it has to be what God has for the people that day and that's it that's it and so you have to be molded you have to be broken and the the way that a gift operates is not that you take it and use it but the gift is that you get yourself out of the way so that God can use you whether it's music whether it's Ministry whether it's helps whether it's the conversations we have with people and learning to say the right thing at the right time all of these things are what they are a yielding rather than a wielding can I put it that way it is a yielding rather than wielding it's not that you take it and use it it's that you step back and he takes you and starts to use you in a way that you couldn't use any other that you couldn't do any other way amen but God's preparing us for a specific Place God doesn't have children for the sake of children he has them because he has a purpose and a place for each and every one of us men and women boy or girl children adults it doesn't matter he says this now when this child was born he became a son the very moment he was born in the family he says you get it but then there was a tutor over this boy to educate him and to raise him up well he was no more than a servant said the galatian letter until he came to an age a certain limited time that was set and this tutor would always take the father word your son is progressing right or whatever it was now this Tudor in the natural went to the father and said now here that boy is not going to be very good I try to teach him he just won't listen he's got his own headstrong way and he just won't listen he's going to be this or he's going to be that what the son is saying I don't want what you've got I'm going to be this and I'm going to be that listen when we're boys we always want to be many times what our what our dad is but sometimes we we see things in uh you know like Jensen wants to be a tuna fisherman where does he get that from not for me he wants to be a tuna fisherman or he wants to be this or he wants to be that what he's saying is the sun God's he got a vision he got he saw something that he liked and because he likes it he says I want to be that that's not going to work that's not going to work he says the father realizes right then if that boy keeps fighting if that boy keeps pushing back he realizes right then that that boy cannot take over his domain that's right because what would he do he'd run it through the return of the prodigal son gives a beautiful picture of it see he could not what he would do would be to mortgage the farmer sell it off and drink it off and run around what would he do he'd take what the father had and then sell it get rid of it to benefit what he wanted in his dreams and his ideas so in other words what he's saying here is this tutor was responsible to be in charge of that boy and he was supposed to come to the father and give him regular updates on what that boy was doing and these days we get what we get a report card from school and it's a piece of paper but this kind of a tutor didn't give it just a paper report he came and he gave a verbal report to the father on how his son was doing and all of these things because the father wanted a son that was guaranteed to be ready for the adoption ceremony so he could step in and help the father and he wanted those updates to be real he wanted a tutor that wouldn't tell him what he wanted to hear but a tutor that would tell him exactly what was going on so he'd know whether or not he could trust that son to see if that son was prepared now notice what he's talking about here he's not just talking about knowledge when we get report cards from our children at school most of that report card is focused on knowledge did they get A's or B's or C's in math and science and all these different things and we looked down that report card and we are so proud when our kid gets straight A's but you know what the place is that we ought to be most proud of it's that little box at the bottom where the teacher gives us a verbal report on what our child is like I've always told my children I'm happier if you get a Citizenship Award then you get straight A's because that proves who you are not what you know and I'm more interested in what you are rather than what you know amen and guess what God is the exact same way and we'll get into it here a little bit amen but at the bottom that teacher is going to say is your child interruptive are they kind or mean are they a bully or are they helpful do they give up their time and energy to others or are they take take take and that's where the teacher is really letting you know how your children's doing with everybody else are they an asset or are they a liability in the classroom and we want our kids to reflect the character that hopefully we're teaching them at home and that they're showing that in the school when they're out from under the eyes of Mommy and Daddy and that's a reflection of who they are inside and it's not just a put on when they're around mommy and daddy amen he would say now the father has to find the right man the man the right kind of a tutor and that's a beautiful type of the church that when we become sons of God born into the kingdom of God the Father sent us the best tutor that he could find and that's the Holy Spirit now he never sent us an Archbishop to be our tutor or a general overseer or a district man or a pastor or Minister that's not what it's meant I'm not here to run your life I'm not here to tell you what to do I'm here to point you to the one that knows where you're supposed to go what you're supposed to do how you're supposed to spend your time but I can only turn you back to this anyways that's what I'm supposed to do buying this pulpit and as we count Converse in these different things I've got to point you back to this and if it comes to opinion I've got to clearly State this is my opinion because I don't have a word to stand on but he says you've got to have the right tutor and it's got to be the Holy Spirit he says that's where we've made our mistake the church is governed by the Holy Spirit and that's God's government for his church but we've adopted other tutors and other razors and then this tutor must be just he says not pull any punches he must bring the direct truth to the father and how that tutor must blush when he comes up to the father in his face and said Your son's not doing too good he's failing in his studies he's dilatory he can't say he's doing well when he's not because if he does the father will take him at his word and he'll put him in a place that he's not ready for he says now the tutor must feel to come before the father with such a message as that about his son and I often wonder how the Holy Spirit must feel in the presence of God so much World in it people so dilatory that he's been So Graceful to to and given the new birth he says oh it must be terrible what God has provided everything we could ask for and then what do we do with it buffkes nothing he says they're not doing anything with it they've given they've been given everything and they're doing nothing with it and they're not they're just lazy they're not they're not stepping up to the plate they don't realize what they have they don't appreciate what they have that tutor was being paying good money to spend his time and efforts on that son to raise him and he's saying your son doesn't appreciate what's being put in front of him he says bringing it down home now remember that conduct of yours goes straight to the presence of God by somebody who won't pull punches no matter how good a neighbor you are what a fine pillar you are in the church he says the Holy Spirit brings the truth to God what about how you act not about what we know adoption is not just about knowledge I meant adoption is just not about what we know amen you got to know the the the right things and you've got to know the truth and you've got to have a basis for your life but knowing what's under the Seven Seals will not make you a child of God an adopted son of God knowing the threefold mystery revealing of Christ will not make you a child of God knowing the godhead knowing the original sin will not make you an adopted son of God that's just knowledge there's no doctrinal test to get into heaven there's no doctrinal test for the new birth I can prove by the scripture he says what the holy spirit will lead you into all truth you don't have to have the truth right now to have the Holy Ghost but if you got the Holy Ghost it will lead you into all truth and we sit here saying I've got all truth therefore I have the Holy Ghost no no no if you're raised around truth you can have it and never have it because it's not just about what you know it's going to be about how you apply it amen we can get straight A's in message Doctrine and go straight to hell that's the hard truth listen that's what they had in Jesus Day Jesus is standing before the Pharisees and they all had Straight A's in Old Testament Doctrine they thought and then the word made flesh stood in front of them and gave them the real truth and they said it was blasphemy they said it was satanic and they rejected it and then in the end they killed it but yet they had Straight A's in theology why because they didn't have the life behind it they didn't have a true revelation of what it was I've said it before before I ever got the Holy Ghost I thought I knew truth because I've been raised under him we have brother Mark in Sunday school and brother Jill as a pastor teaching things over the pulpit and you think you know truth but as soon as you get the Holy Ghost you realize before then I had tinted glasses on and guess what they were they weren't tinted by the blood of the Lamb they were tinted by sin they were tinted by personal bias they were tinted by my own hypocrisy and I would look at people in situations and judge them because I had the truth and I didn't have the truth any more than a hot and taught does I needed the new birth to open my eyes to what was really behind this Jesus said to the to the Pharisees they did everything he says you died even down to the mint and cumin the little tiny things he says and you've omitted the weightier matters of the law and what did he say those were judgment mercy and faith they kept the the letter of the law but they could not apply the law properly they didn't have proper judgment they didn't show Mercy he says you go and you take widow's houses for Pete's sake you take from people that can't afford to to give in those situations you you use the law to take something from somebody that you know full well deserves to hold on to that and he says what you're everyone you're Vipers you're no good you don't have what you think you have he says you're white at sepulchers beautiful on the outside and inside you're full of dead men's bones why because they got straight A's in the word but they didn't have the reality of it they didn't have a true revelation of what it looked like before I've spoken of this before as an engineer we come out of University and some of us have excellent grades I didn't and we have all that knowledge you could say we have all knowledge in our heads and then you go into a job and do they put us in the position that requires all knowledge no they put us down at the bottom doing the most basic of things why because that's all you know how to do the most basic of things but then what did they do they put you under a more senior engineer and he or she starts to teach you and starts to share their information and it's amazing how many times you'll work with those senior engineers and you and you'll you'll relay a theory to them and they don't even remember the theory they don't remember the theory but you ask them how do I do this and they can put the theory that they've forgotten into action and show you how it really works in real life and if we can humble ourselves as Engineers to that person that doesn't know as much as we know but can practically do a hundred thousand times more than we can and that's why they're paid a hundred thousand times more then we'll start to learn and will start to grow as an engineer and pretty soon we'll start getting promoted why because we're able to apply what we know rather than just recite what we know I remember that when I when I did one of my senior projects my final University and we had a boyfriend girlfriend combination in my team and she ended up winning top marks for her graduating group for her you know she was civil I think he was an Naval architectural or something and we got both of them in our group and we got to the place in our in one of our projects and he said I can't figure it out and I don't have time and he walked away left us hanging smartest guy in the class but he couldn't even stick out the job why it was all up here and he didn't have anything in here that would keep him going until he could figure it out this is what the Tudors were reporting about is not just what do they know but how do they take it and use it how do they apply these things I remember a man in Texas and he didn't attend church very often it's a common theme among these types of people and he brought one of his converts to church one day and he said he's going to be a great preacher he knows all the Mysteries he can tell you all the things under the Seven Seals he just needs the Holy Ghost and you sit there and you say what are you talking about he's going to be a great preacher and he doesn't have the Holy Ghost what was he going on what he knew rather than what he had and that boy never amounted to anything and neither did that man why because they couldn't do the simplest of things in their Christian walk and yet he wanted to put him up into the position of ministry no wasn't going to work it was all up here and there was nothing in here Paul said if I know all Mysteries and have the gift of Prophecy and have not charity which is God's love which is the Holy Ghost he says I'm nothing what would Paul say if I get straight A's and I don't have the Holy Ghost I'm it that's it nothing not even worth talking about listen to this brother Brown says love God's love it'll take the place of speaking in tongues and that's all right it'll take the place of gifts and wonders and signs and everything else if you haven't got love that accompanies that what good does the signs do you God's tried to do it across the nation but it wouldn't work the greatest of all gifts is wisdom he says the second is knowledge if you haven't got wisdom to control your knowledge what goods your knowledge going to do see what I mean he said seek the first things first you can't seek CEO when you're just the new engineer in the building no seek to be the first engineer the lowly engineer and then seek the junior engineer position then the senior engineer position then the chief engineer position then the head of r d and work your way up he says seek the first things first get it in the right order and you'll come out okay get it in the right order don't seek to skip you know they um there's a couple students in in schools and they they they're very they're very intelligent and what they do is oftentimes they'll let them skip a class you know what often happens it's to their disadvantage because they aren't mature enough to handle that next step they have the knowledge to step up and skip a class but they don't have the maturity to step up into another realm of community and so in the end it hurts them because they're jumping they're skipping something about not to he says so what I mean seek the first things first we've gone after gifts we've gone after this we've gone after that because the Supernatural is done he said but brother don't see gifts don't seek favor with denomination he says seek the love of God and then he says do it Brethren as I said before there isn't a doctoral test enter Heaven the holy spirit's the one that's going to lead us and brother Brown is here is saying he's saying get the first things first do it in the order that God said you're supposed to do it and then move on from there and God will lead you and he'll progress you as you what truly learn these different things as we're coming into this idea of adoption then adoption is a reflection of two things wisdom and character wisdom and character now what is wisdom wisdom is knowledge applied correctly and character is a victory character is a victory character is when you are put to the test in real life and you apply what you learn in a way properly regardless of how it feels regardless of how it looks regardless of pressure regardless of what people want you to do you'll do what's right no matter what that's what character is and that's the victory because you've got to sacrifice everything that this body wants to what the word says for you to do he says and then the father after he had given the tutors the rights to raise his son the tutor had to bring word to the father how the son was progressing he says now Yeti was there of all things but yet he didn't come into legal possession until there was a ceremony you say well I got to get to the ceremony brother John he says and he had fully done fully done that which was right and was worthy remember when Jesus talked about he says a man had two sons and he said to the one he said go and work in the vineyard and the son said I'll go do it and then he didn't do it and then he said to the second son go do and the son said I won't do it but then he went and did it and he said which one loved the Father the one that said it or the one that did it and they said the one that did it so he's talking about here have you fully done have you done exactly what he said not just in part because remember Saul was 95 correct Saul was 95 percent as before I said he was 95 in the will of God but that five percent that he left undone was what took him out and God said I've taken the kingdom away from you because you won't fully do what I've asked you to do so adoption is based in on what you do with what you know so the first test is he says do you know what you've been taught can you recite it can you repeat truth back to me and then the second test is can you apply the truth that you know I I think I'm going to resonate with a lot of people here when I say most people do okay with math as long as the equations are written out for you you can resolve an equation you can figure out mathematics as long as it's written out for you but where do most of us fall flat on our face those stupid word problems right because they say if if Bob has three apples and Susie has two apples and the train they're on is running 90 miles an hour what time is it in Tokyo that's what it sounds like to us doesn't it that's not what that's not what it says but that's as strange as it seems to us and we say what in the world am I supposed to do with this now and everything you need to solve that that word problem has been given you already but you don't know how to apply it so what good was the knowledge they taught you unless you can apply it I remember I was I was in a jack-in-the-box which is a fast food restaurant in Texas and a a kid came in he was 16 about 16 years old I would imagine he came in and he said how much is that meal and they said it's uh six dollars and they said plus tax and he said how much is tax six and a half percent so he said about a dollar fifty then no no that'd be about 38 cents you know but he couldn't do it in his head he couldn't his concept of percentages hadn't translated into real world ability to to handle these things this is what the test of the sum was is can you now take it and apply it and then after you have learned how to apply it the question is will you apply it because you can say well I know math and I figured out the word problem but will you apply it will you go work in a cashier position and you can do it on the fly now and you can handle all of that in your head and somebody gives you two dollars and it's a dollar seventy six and you've got to come up with 24 cents change in your hand like that can you do it and will you do it but the test for the sun now was would he do it when it was difficult to do it would he do it when everything in him screamed I don't want to do it and yet the father's tutor said this is what you have to do and this is the Father's will and this is what you're supposed to go into amen it can't be just head knowledge for us look at this James says this I've been reading James in in uh in my devotions these mornings and James is a rough character boy James didn't suffer fools gladly I think he had a bit of German in him he called it the way he saw it and this is what the tutor's doing the tutor calls it the way he sees it he's not there to to gloss over it or make things look better James says this in in 121 he says wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls he says and be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves notice here you don't deceive anybody else when you're a hearer but not a doer the only one that's deceived is you because everybody can look at your life and say he or she talks one way and they live another way and they're not fooled you might fool people for a little bit but you won't fool them for very long if you say one thing and do another so James is saying the only person that's deceived here is you you're self-deceived if you hear but you don't do amen but he says for if any watch how he explains this now he's Paul's trying to help us or James trying to help us understand this he says for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's like a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholds himself and goes his way and straightway forgets what manner of man he was so he's saying a person that is a hero but not a doer is like a person that looks in a mirror and they look and they say yup everything's okay everything's good and they turn and walk away and they forget what they even look like they forget is my tie on straight is something crooked you know is my hair out of place and so they've got to keep coming back to the mirror to remember what they look like because it hasn't been absorbed in them and he says what happens when you're a hearer but not a doer is there's no life inside of you so you have to keep coming back to the mirror to check do I look like a Christian do I act like a Christian because there's not something inside of you that's driving it so you keep coming back to appearance because appearance is all you have because you're a hearer and not a doer and so what you're having to do is you're having to keep coming back and you keep having to say what does a Christian act like what does a Christian look like what does a Christian do what does a Christian say because as soon as you walk away you forget it as soon as you walk out of church you forget what it's supposed to be because the Life of Christ is not in You by the Holy Spirit that's what James is saying here is when you're here is there's nothing in you to drive it and so you walk away and you instantly forget what it is you are supposed to be it's like the parable of the sower in Matthew 13 and Jesus is talking about it and that parable of the sower he puts seed all over the place and sometimes we can sit here and we can say well what was the seed he said it was the word of God and he says and and the the ground was different people's lives and so what happens so often is we say well the word is all over my life there's seed all over my life therefore I must be a good field but no he's just throwing seed and so just because their seed there doesn't mean that your your life is ready for the word of God because remember there were seed all over the rocky ground and somebody could go and say look I found a field and this is going to be wonderful no that's Rocky ground it's no good and what happens is the field is where what the seed grows and matures not where the seed lands remember scripture talks about that they throw out a net and they get all sorts of things Wrigley things and squiggly things and things they don't want and what do they do with everything in that net that Fisherman's Net that they they pulled in they take what they want and they throw the rest out just because you're caught in the net doesn't mean you're a child of God and just because you're sitting under the preaching of the word does not mean you're a child of God or you're an adopted son of God potentially you are but the proof is going to be in how you act not in what you say not just in what you say let me put it that way remember Jesus said that those those people that had Rocky ground he says they have received the word with Joy happily they were happy they sat under the preacher the word they said praise the Lord hallelujah that was so good and then he said what happens is cares of life and trials and persecutions arise and they're offended and they walk away he says and it's like the sun coming down and burning it right out of their life it has no root and therefore it can't live through those times what am I saying this for because we can't be judged just by how we accept the word because if we accept it up here and it doesn't go in here and live then it didn't it wasn't accepted in the first place amen we judge ourselves by how we Act not by how we talk and that's what the tutor was doing was he wasn't just there to say your son talks right he was there to say your son acts right he thinks the way you do and then he puts it into action the same way you do listen if we're if we're going to be you know easy time Christians we're not going to grow we're not going to mature listen we sing that song in the good times praise His name and the bad times do the same in everything give the King of Kings all the praise that's what it looks like to be a real Christians whether the size or the skies are Sunny like they've been for the last few days praise the Lord or whether they've been cloudy which they were for the last few months praise the Lord anyways that's the way it's got to be in our lives amen whether it's good or bad we've got to say the tutor is here and he's bringing me to a place and he's got me in a position where I'll learn to be what God wants me to be how many children here are tired of going to school one wow three we get tired don't we we get tired of getting up in the morning and putting on the same clothes and going to the same place and hearing the same teachers say the same things with the same people that half of them Annoy Us day in and day out day in and day out most people don't enjoy going to school and then what do they do when they're done teaching you in the classroom they take you out in the gym for phys Ed and they run you around until you're ragged right and you sit there and you say I'm not an athlete I'm never going to be an athlete why do I have to do it do this why do they do it why they do it young people for your good because they know that it's not just enough to exercise up here you got to exercise physically you've got to have a well-rounded education you've got to be pushed in ways you don't want to be pushed so you'll grow and mature because when you come into life later and you've got to get up every morning for work you'll have learned hey I did that in school and in school they made you do it but now you've got to come to the place where you're willing to do it because you've seen the benefit of what that commitment and that consistency brought you in those places what they're doing is preparing you for real life whether you like it or not that's what the parents are doing aren't they that's why we have to eat broccoli spinach brussels sprouts all these things from the lower regions because it's good for us better for us than what we'd want to eat that's what the tutor is doing is he's feeding us things that will make us what God wants us to be even if we don't like it right now but listen you'll like it in the end you'll like the benefits you won't like it nobody likes the breaking and the molding process nobody likes eating yucky vegetables if they're yucky to them but in the end you're really happy with how it turns out and that's how you learn that you can't go with what you want all the time and come out the way God wants you to you're going to have to go through tough times you're going to have to go through rough times he said God is looking for character from men and women who can what conduct themselves as Sons and Daughters of the king conduct God have mercy on us that we will do it that's what I'm after friends as character that's what God is pulling for is character for that bride that will be taken out and as Sons and Daughters of God he says let's act like it be Sons and Daughters God help us so the final test is not can you recite or can you apply but will you apply it in your day-to-day life and that's what character looks like is will you apply what the tutor has taught you in your everyday life amen how do we act when the tough decisions arrive how do we act when money gets short how do we act when we get sick how do we act when the job seems like it's not going so well how do we act when we're feeling unsatisfied how do we act when our relationships aren't so good how do we act when things just aren't the way that we thought they ought to be that's how we show our character everybody's a sunny day Christian very few people are rainy day Christians especially when it rains and rains and rains the year I moved to BC in February we had 27 out of 28 days had rain that's worse than Newfoundland 27 out of 28 days had rain do you know how hard it is to go out every day and have rain rain rain rain and sometimes we go through times in life and all it is is rain and guess what there's a purpose for it there's a purpose for it because we have to be content no matter where we find ourselves in life and sometimes God got to bring us to a place where we're not content so we can understand what true Godly contentment looks like amen when we'll take it and we come up to the line and and we've got to make a decision brother Joe was sharing some things with work and challenges he's facing listen we got to put our livelihoods on the line our reputations on the line our financial well-being on the line even our physical and mental health on the line constantly as Believers and say Lord whatever I have is because you've given it and it's you that preserves it's you that gives it's you that provides and I'll put it on the line every single time because I've seen you come back and give it to me time and time and time again speaking of this son because there's a report card that's going out for each one of us and it's a full spectrum card it's not just knowledge it's not just application but it's the way you live and act every single day of your life amen and when we get to the place where that report card reads Christ Christ Christ Christ Christ Christ that's when he says now you're ready son now you're ready daughter to step up into your Kingdom Purpose speaking of that type of person he said how he likes to be about the father's business how he likes to eat brussels sprouts how he likes to do the things that he used to not like to do remember I shared that story how my wife I think it was on a Saturday night and and and she said um or we had to do something first thing in the morning go on a trip and she said by the way there's no gas in the van and it was howling wind and it was raining it was stormy and it was horrible it was 10 30 at night and I was upset because it's 10 30 at night and I want to go to bed instead I got to put all my clothes back on and go out and gas up the van in horrible weather but then something said you're a man you're a husband put on your big boy boots and do what men do and it's not so much that I enjoyed standing out in the wind and the rain and these things but you know what there's something that comes from doing what you're supposed to do that brings a sense of contentment and fulfillment even when it's tough and sometimes what happens then is God will allow you to have that for the fun times not just for the work times because when you can deal with that bad weather for the things that really matter then it means you can go out and hunt in the mountains and deal with bad weather and enjoy it because you built up that resilience to the place where you say this is what it means to be a man this is what it means to be a mother this is and you can actually Relish in the idea that you're doing what you're supposed to do and you've withstood the rigor and you've gone through the training so you can actually step up to the plate and do what most people will run away from every time you'll get to the place where you actually enjoy doing work he says he likes to be about the father's business how he loves to do the things that the father likes for him to do oh how the tutor would come to the father and say Sir oh I bring you great news your boy he's just a chip off the old block he's just like his daddy he says well that's the way the Holy Spirit wants to bring it when you believe all of God's word when you accept the full gosp the whole full gospel when you believe in everything God wrote that it's the truth God wants you to believe it that way then how the father must swell his chest out and say yes that's my boy and what happened then later on there came a time when that father adopted that child into the family he said or do you clergyman there's the placing of a son is what I'm speaking of and he adopted his own child or placed him positionally in his family now he was just a boy to begin with he says they had to find out what his character was that's what this whole thing was about is does he have character to handle what's coming his way because maybe his father owned a multi-million dollar business and if you don't have character the first thing you're going to do when you get that checkbook is go write a check for a Lamborghini or to give yourself a big flashy office or to wear fancy clothes or to buy a big house and that's not what the father got it for you that's not why he gave it to you he gave it to you so you could grow the business and stay humble and be a reflection of the things that are right in life not just the things that we want in life and these different things like I said I've been reading James and my devotions and and he's so Direct if I could put it that way James didn't pull any punches James would say it the way he was and he'd say look if you lack something in your character don't hide it it's a go and ask God who gives liberally liberally more than you need more than you want all you have to say is I lack something and he'll give you what you need but he doesn't just give it to you like he does a download into your brain of wisdom or something but he puts you in situations catch it he puts you in situations to apply the thing that you kept failing before and that's how he gives it to you is by experience don't ever pray for patience because God will put you in the situation that requires patience to prove you've got it to prove that you can endure to prove that you can have the right action and the reaction those different things and James is saying don't hold back because you don't have it ask God admit you don't have it admit you need it and watch him do it because that's the kind of God he is because he'll give you tutors and governors to raise you to the standard that he requires for what you're trying to do in your life according to his will remember but James would say this he'd say what does it profit my brethren though a man say he had faith and have not works can Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked in destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart and peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things that are needful to the body what does it profit so he said somebody comes to you with a need and they don't have the they're not going to come truly naked but they come and they need clothes maybe they need a winter jacket maybe their kids don't have boots for the winter and they say I have that or I'm hungry he says you don't say be thou warm praise the Lord sister he says what are you talking about that's nonsense that's silliness he says give them what they need of because you got what they need so give it to him he says your faith is not the Lord will provide the the faith is the Lord has provided me to give to you I remember a story about brother Perry green and the deacons came to him in a group and they said you know brother so-and-so has a financial need and we came to you so we could all pray as a group and brother Perry said is it a real need yes is it a genuine need yes he says why will we pray about it he says open up your wallets and open up your checkbooks and let's take care of the need why because he'd read James that said if a brother has need then you give it to him but he's got to be a brother indeed it's got to be a sister indeed it can't be somebody that's running around wasting all their money or doing these things but if it's a real and genuine need through no fault of their own he says then you provide it what was he saying to the deacons he says you're so spiritual you're of no earthly good in this case he says if God has blessed you that much he says put your faith where your mouth is and give him what you have need and Trust the god that gave it to you in the first place will restore to you what you need on the back end write your check out and use your faith to meet their need and watch God meet yours on the back end if you need it that's what James is talking about he would say even so faith if it had not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy work so in other words James is saying prove your faith without doing something he says you can because that doesn't make sense faith without action is not faith in the first place Faith puts you into action he says you do that he says and I will show you my faith by my Works he says I'll prove I've got the faith he says that you don't think I have by doing what you can't and won't do he says you got faith but you won't do the thing that I'm about to do and my what I'm about to do shows that I have faith that you don't think I have you're looking at me and you're saying well you don't have faith you don't have faith he says my actions prove I've got more faith than you do because all you do is talk and all I do is act like I said James was a sharp individual didn't suffer spiritual fools gladly he says Thou believe is that there is one God thou doest well you know the doctrines you know the the truth of the of the word of an open Word of the scriptures that have been revealed he says Thou thou doest well the Devils also believe in tremble in other words Satan believes everything you believe so don't rest on what you believe as the be-all and end-all of your Christian walk he says but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead knowledge without faith to live it or put it into action he says his vanity is Vanity and that's what you'll find like I talked about that engineer his knowledge was vanity because when push came to shove and he couldn't figure it out he walked away he wasn't committed to actually taking it all the way into learning and applying it until he got the solution he needed James said the same way faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar he says seeth Thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was made perfect I went in the Amplified to to understand this he says James said do you see that his faith was cooperating with his works and his faith was completed and reached its Supreme expression when he implemented it by good works so in other words when Abraham took what he had up here or what he had in here by faith and put it into action he says that was the full expression of his faith because he was willing to put his child's life on the line because he believed that God would raise him up from the dead that was the proof of his faith was when he put it into action when he put it into works he says and the scripture was fulfilled which says Abraham believed God what was the proof of Abraham's belief that he said he believed no that he laid Isaac on the Altar and was willing to kill him at God's command believing that God would raise him up because Isaac was the child of promise and the nation had to come through Isaac he says it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God what when he believed God and put it into action that's where righteousness was imputed to him he says you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only the Amplified says you see that a man is Justified or pronounced righteous before God through what he does and not alone through faith so don't throw Faith out the window but he says it's not just Faith you can't just say I have faith therefore I am righteous before God he says no through what he does and not alone through faith through works of obedience as well as by what he believes now I want to explain this a minute because otherwise what you'll do is you'll go the other side and you'll say by works I'm going to make it that's a lie from the pit of Hell that is alive from the pit of Hell by grace through faith are you saved I've got the scripture here in a second but what James is saying that what he's saying here is that sheep produce wool if you eat like a sheep if you walk like a sheep if you look like a sheep then you're going to produce wool and what he's saying is if you just say you're a sheep but you never produce wool there's something wrong because sheep always produce wool so if you do all the things that are that sheep do and you are a sheep you'll produce wool but if you do all the things that a sheep does but you aren't a sheep you'll never produce wool no matter how hard you try but he said the proof is in the wool not in the fact that you're saying you're a sheep because he would say this in Ephesians 2 8 for by grace are you saved and we'd say hallelujah praise the lord it's a Grace work it's a Grace work but he says no by grace are you saved through faith through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God James is saying God has saved you by grace and that Grace is accompanied by something it's accompanied by faith and that isn't just Faith to take you into the water and have you baptized and have you Justified and Sanctified but he says it's a faith that keeps growing and growing and moving and moving you until you come into the statue of a perfect man in Christ Jesus it's a faith that comes to take you from the start to the Finish that's the faith that he's talking about it's a faith that makes you a child of God that makes you produce the very life of God inside of you that comes out where it's not just in your head or in your mouth but it is an actual Living Faith it is character if we could put it that way amen listen God doesn't give us Grace just so we can be justified as if we never did anything in the first place Sanctified so we're cleaned up so we can sit here and be a Sanctified lump what good is a Sanctified lump without life you're no good get all cleaned up and then God won't use you because you're too what lazy to step forward you won't let faith produce its perfect work you hold back because you're satisfied because your conscience is clean and your life is clean and that's all you really needed in the first place but he says no it's got to take you all the way to you start producing God in your very own life God wants to get us in a position where we're a benefit for others not just accepting his benefits for ourselves and that's the life of a true servant he says your character is God's character what is it just a little pushover no sir God is a god of judgment he's a god of correct I believe he means god of correction he says it must be on the line it must be straight as a narrow it's a Razor's Edge it's a Razor's Edge you've got to be right on that line he says nothing else will do that's the kind of character you are why because you're the character of your father we're going to get into this a little bit later the expressed attributes of God that means you got to have his character because that's the only thing that's what character is is the attributes of God in your life he would say you say you see a man's characters made known by his works whatever you are your Works prove what you are no matter how much you testify whatever you say Pro con that has nothing to do with it your Works tell what you are and it tells what you are inside not your words your works every job you do manifest what you are and you do you businessmen if you just do a patched up job see what I mean just a halfway job don't do that if you can't do it right don't do it at all that's right and when you come to Christ if you can't absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come to Christ he says don't come at all but when you really want to be a Christian stand out make it real that's what God wants you to be and that'll prove your Works will prove what your character is your character is known by The Works that you do take it back to Ephesians 2 8 where he says for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourself is the gift of God what is Paul saying there he says Grace is effective it does something somebody receives Grace there's going to be an effect because it's a company with faith that takes them from where they are to where they ought to be and that's what we're resting on him and is that he gave us the faith it's not even our faith it's the faith of God that he's given us to take us through this journey amen James is saying you can't have faith and then not have works just doesn't work that way it's impossible he says you can't say you have faith and you never step out in faith to actually do something to take God at his work he would finish up in James 2 he says for as the body without the spirit is dead he says so faith without works is dead also so remember we're speaking from this adoption standpoint so when we say we've learned and we say we've understood if there's not a change in our life then we haven't understood and we haven't accepted it the way that it was meant to be accepted or learned that's what he's saying is you've got to have a change here you've got to have works that follow that understanding that belief that learning that you've gone through that truth that you say you have it has to be a life-changing experience otherwise it's not truth as you've accepted it at least it may be truth but you haven't accepted it in the way that it's really truth brother Brian said something along the lines of this he says if you really believed it you'd live it you really believed that you'd live it now the thing is this it can't be an act that's what the hearers and not doers do is they act it out this can't be an act but you're going to produce the very life of God through your life for other people's benefit if you've really got what you say you have he says our own testimony meets Us in the face by the word in other words Our Testimony comes up and it looks at us and it reflects the word in front of us and says is that really what you've got because it puts the word next to us and then it puts us up there and it Compares it to and says are they the same thing that's what our testimony does he says otherwise it just became a routine around and around and around and he says the father says so we say it too be careful now he says if you really believe it act like it so what happens here is it sounds harsh but he says if you're a testimony and your actions don't line up you've gotten into the routine of just repeating what was said over the pulpit of just repeating what you read in your Bible of just repeating what so and so said and he says it's not actually hitting the mark because it's not changing you you're just listening and you become a parrot parrots do not get adopted we can't have message parents we've got to have true born Sons and Daughters of God by the New Birth by the indwelling of the holy spirit amen it can't be an act it can't be an act it's got to be a real nature change amen we're talking about a living faith that's what character is is a living faith amen listen this church is not just a community of like-minded people if it's that word denomination I had a co-worker back in Edmonton and I gotten to testifying to him about different things and and whatnot and he said he said John I was at my church the other day he says and they had a drag show so I'm not going to that church anymore I said that's a good idea he said I want to come to your church and you know what I said why why do you want to go to church he says well my wife and I just want a community I said I won't say his name I said that's not why we go to church I said we go to church to be changed we go to church to be challenged I said we go there to hear what God wants for us in our life and I says we do have a community I said but it is not a community like that I said this is about people that are serving a living God and it takes a real real effect in their life I said it's not a community a community like you're talking about I didn't say don't come I said that's not what you're going to find because he'd be uncomfortable here because he'd want community and what we're looking for is new births and Sons and Daughters of God we want don't want people that are heroes only but doers listen we got to have hearers first they got to be a hearer first because listen if they can even hear it that's God working in their life if you can even hear it before you've gotten a new birth that's God opening up the door that's God calling you so that's a miracle but if all you want is to go in there and not have drag shows this ain't the place we'll never have a drag show but this is not the place for that amen this is rubber meets the road this is a living reality that we're looking for in each and every one of our Lives amen we're almost done he says now listen Presbyterian friend Methodist Baptist Pentecostal when you're born again that only puts you in the family remember Jesus said that when in the parable of the sower he says some bring fold 30-fold some 60 fold some 100 fold All Sons and Daughters of God some only bring forth a little bit some bring forth a lot but they all bring forth every single one of them brings forth and I've said before this is my personal belief I don't have a scripture for it but you'll bring forth as much as you let God use you the more you'll surrender the more he'll bring forth in your life I was talking to a brother about you know we talk about some of the gifts that are in our midst and these different things and and visions and dreams and prophecy and these things and and he said the the most powerful gifts I've seen are in the humblest people I know that's it because it's not about them it's not about them and it was a sovereign gift that God gave them when he brought them to the place where they wouldn't use it for their benefit because you know what people that have that gift if they want to use it for their benefit they use it for business Deals they use it for gambling they use it for the lottery they use it for all these different things and doesn't work that way it says the humblest people I know but he says what he says when you're born again that puts you in the family that confirms you're in the family of God when God gives you the Holy Spirit that's his confirmation that's his seal that you are a true child of God he says but it's your character your conduct that gives God confidence in you the reason we haven't got the great church marching on today is because God can't find people to put his confidence in the Holy Spirit keeps saying they're tearing up they're breaking up they're doing this they're off the lines he says stay with God's word that's God's truth that's the pattern that's the blueprint there's something I don't have it here but the prophet God says something along the lines of that's what catches God's attention is a people that will stay with his word not how well we sing not how well we preach not how no no people that will stay with his word that's what matters most to God Amen when did the ceremony take place when the father was convinced when he was assured when he was absolutely positive that his son was ready and he didn't look at the neighbor's son The Neighbor comes over and says oh we just had the adoption for little Johnny today or Big Johnny hallelujah praise the Lord he didn't let that bother him he didn't let you know Mama's saying you know we really got to get him into the family business no he had to be convinced regardless of outside pressure regardless of how fast or slow other people were going he had to be convinced that his son was ready for the family business and until that happened he wouldn't do it but there was a window of time there's a window of time and if that sun turned 20 or whatever it was and he wasn't it the father just said enough's enough if you haven't learned by now you're never going to learn and they moved on to the next Sun there was a window of Grace if I could put it that way for you to step up before God says you know what you'll be a son but I can't trust you you'll be a daughter but I can't trust you and you're just gonna have to sit in the house and do nothing because you don't prove yourself you haven't proven yourself you haven't stepped up he says this oh I wish I had the ability to grind that into the people's hearts God is looking for time tested Christians remember he said seek first things first what comes after first second third fourth fifth there's a progression time-tested Christians you'll see this in business when somebody does well at the first level then they get promoted to the second level when they do well at the second level then they'll go to the third level in these different things and they'll go until they can't go any further why their time tested they're proven throughout the organization he says God's looking for time-tested Christians every son that cometh to God must be tried child trained tested he says and you who jump from Pillar To Post and this to that and in and out how can God ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you he says now think of that for a minute how can you be positionally placed when you will not stand long enough for God to do it we think back to our own preferences and the simple truth is that if we had our own way as soon as things got uncomfortable we'd move we'd move our job we'd move our relationship this is what's happening in the world today right people get married and as soon as it gets uncomfortable what do they do divorce and go find the next one and then when that doesn't work out they go and they find the next one the next one the next one it's a it's a repeating cycle that gets in there they don't like the job they're in it's difficult they're not getting the recognition they they want and all these different things what do they do just off and go why because they won't stick it through to be tested and tried so that they can come up to the next level and that's tough to do I've been there I've been there that's tough to do but guess what for a child of God God is in it that's what I've learned is God is in it whether I'm sitting in the Pew whether I'm behind the pulpit whether I'm doing well financially whether the job is good whether the job not is not good it's God preparing you for something that's coming down the road for you every single time we've got to be able to stick it through the hard times not just the easy times imagine the scripture says that that we are like trees planted by rivers of Living Water can you imagine if a tree had the opportunity to move itself around based on how the environment was based on how the climate was based on how the conditions what would happen if that tree and it and it was in a certain place and all of a sudden the drought came it would just up and walk over to where there is no drought wouldn't it but what happens in the drought time is it drives the roots deeper and deeper and that brings stability to the plant it brings stability to the tree and it can find nutrients where nobody else can and it'll survive the drought and then as the droughts get tougher it can survive longer and longer not only that it stabilizes it so when the storms come then the roots are dug deep and that tree can withstand it when we lived in Texas the water there was so or the ground was so hard packed the water wouldn't be absorbed in and so the trees often have roots that just spread out along the top and we had this tree in our backyard four foot through the middle four foot diameter and we got Hurricane Ike came up with 90 mile an hour sustained winds and that hundred footer went boom and crashed right down our backyard and it only had one deep root and in that kind of wind in a tree that big it wouldn't hold it but if it had put through a tougher time it would have had more Roots down and it might have held up and some of the trees did have that but that big one in the end it crashed because it only had one root holding it and nothing everything else was on the surface and it just ripped them right out when things got tough we don't move because things are tough we don't change where we're at I'm talking everything relationally whatever applied to your life the way where you're at this morning but if you keep moving every time things get tough you'll never grow you'll never mature and brother bam said you'll be a hot house plant you can't understand you can't take the rigors of real life and so you'll never mature and then God just ends up and he says all right just sit there we'll keep you in the house you'll be of no good you can't you can't pollinate you can't do anything else you'll just sit there alone and that's all we can do with you because you won't stick it out he says I need somebody that'll stand still long enough for God to adopt you you've got to let it be effective I've shared I sat for three and a half years in British Columbia it was effective and it was horrible but it was effective and if I'd have ran from that God would never have had any confidence to use me later you can't do those things you've got to stick with it and let God have his perfect way in your life you've got to come to a graduation by going through it not by skipping it amen he says character is what God is looking to find somebody that he can get his hands on somebody that'll stand still long enough what was he talking about God is looking for time-tested Christians it character requires proof and that comes over time and the test keeps getting harder and harder and harder and when it's finally the last test then he says all right son all right daughter you're ready to step into the workforce you're ready to start doing what I have for you to do he said God is trying to empty the world out of us and get us to empty ourselves out and be Fearless men and women who love God and will stay with God and will cross the separating Line Jordan that he could use us for his glory this is the hour I want you to think hard and if you have never crossed this place if you have never come across this line where you're saying well my mother belonged to a certain church that's all right but that doesn't take your place see God is calling men and women today to the Battlefront he's not calling them the gilgal neither is he calling them to Jericho or Bethel they will perish he says but he's calling them to Cross Jordan listen to this so he can get you into the school of his own power and make you and mold you amen God bless you each one the musicians will come we'll all Stand Together what's he saying we've got to be able to learn we've got to be able to surrender to the molding hands then we've got to be able to take the tests and the trials then we've got to be able to be in it for the long haul to understand that we're not going to make it to graduation unless we go through grades 1 through 12. and then that we've got to do every single course and every single class and we've got to pass every single stage before we can get there amen notice here what's he saying he's saying he's calling he's calling for men and women that will empty themselves out first Victory God's looking for is over you you want to go and do something for God he's got to get you in his hands where you'll do what he says not what you want to do and that's the first Victory amen I was so happy the first I was talking to my wife a bit about this you know and how you go through life and and when you're in in the in the early school you know you look at you know in our school we had grades kindergarten through six and you looked at the grade Sixers and you're like oh they're so big and there's so mature and so cool and all these things and when you got to grade six how cool and awesome was it there's a big letdown because you just were what you were well then it was well now I'm going to go to grade seven I'm going to be in high school now the high school not high school grade seven oh that's the best guess what you're the same as you were three months before in grade six weren't you and then you're looking at the grade 12s and they're going to graduate they're oh so cool boy oh boy everybody likes them they're so much better than me at hockey when I'm big and fast and strong I'm going to dominate right and then you get up to grade 12 and guess what you didn't dominate because you weren't that good to start with and you weren't that cool because you always were what you always were and you'll always be what you always are you get up there and you realize that it's just where you're at in life and so you don't appreciate that not but I was so happy when I graduated high school yes I'm done then I went to University and guess what I was a big shot in high school I was a little fish in a really big ocean in in University and that wasn't so fun and I thought I was so smart and all of a sudden I wasn't getting straight A's without having to work for it I started getting B's C's D's right not so fun six years of that and you're looking to the end ah it's gonna be great when I'm finished wrote my final exam and was so relieved you know what I did moved to Texas and what's the first thing I had to do write my engineering training exam eight hours studied for three months for that thank you no and after that yes I'm done that well what's after that three years later I gotta write the professional engineering exam covering everything I could possibly know another eight hour exam they say yes I'm done don't have to do any more tests and I didn't for that then God calls you into the ministry and now you're starting from scratch again and it's just one test after another test and so what he's got to prove he has what a minister first can you be still then as an evangelist can you sit on your headship I had to learn all of that had to learn all of that before he could ever put me here and it's one test after another test after another test talked to a brother the other day and he said the testing never ends you're always growing you're always maturing but will you stick with it that's what character is sticking with it no matter what amen why for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God to write another second book of Acts but listen before they ever wrote a book of Acts it started with them in a room waiting sweating stinking 10 straight days simple obedience simple obedience brought them to the place where they could write a book of Acts amen and it's no different for us what's he saying he's saying will you listen to the tutor will you listen to the holy spirit will you take the word and not just repeat it back but in every aspect of your life will you say this is how I live it not just because it's up here but because there's something in me that won't let me get away with it in the first place why because I'm just like my daddy I'm not just like him I am him I'm a part of him and that won't let it go that won't let it go you can't tell a lie without having to make it right you can't cheat remember I told the story about that insurance thing deal when I was down in the states and they said are you going to Mexico with this truck and I said no and I was I was going for a week and I knew it and I got up those stairs and I was ready to take it and I had to walk right back down there and tell him I lied to him and pay the money because they were going to charge me like 1100 for insurance for that truck and I didn't want to do it because my plan had gotten off the rails and things hadn't worked out why God won't let you do it they'll make you repent he'll make you make it right and then he'll say all right let's move on son because what there's going to be days where it's not just going to be eleven hundred dollars it's going to be ten thousand dollars it's going to be you're going to have to let your reputation go you're gonna have to let something go that you don't really want to let go you're gonna have to pay a price you don't want to pay why because he says this is what character does that's what he's looking for church not parents people with character time tested Believers that have stuck with it I'm glad we've got some here I'm glad we've got some Elders that have showed us the way that we can we can say it works and it sticks because sometimes we're not too sure we're not too sure what it looks like I remember said this before when I before I gave my heart to the Lord I said well what if I don't like it do you like it brother Mark do you like it brother Dale do you like it brother Bob listen if it's calling you it's because you like it it's because there's something in you that says the work is going to be better than the fun I have right now because that's what I am I am what he's trying to call me to I'm not where I'm at amen it's the same thing with this the more we resist the more miserable we are but if we'll give in character comes out of it and then God all of a sudden has a son or a daughter that he can use amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord would you help us to Just Surrender Lord to fall back into those molding shaping hands Lord to accept what you've called us to oh we don't have to force it we don't have to rush it we just have to stand still and let you do the work in US Heavenly Father but Lord once we're there don't let us stand still Lord put us into action we pray Heavenly Father give us Lord of faith that puts us into action give us a Faith Lord that is active that is Lord living that people
