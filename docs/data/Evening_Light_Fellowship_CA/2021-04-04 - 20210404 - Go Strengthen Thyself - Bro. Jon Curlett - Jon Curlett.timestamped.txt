[53:31] sacrifice
[53:32] especially for the the new mothers and
[53:34] whatnot and
[53:35] uh certainly appreciate the addition to
[53:37] the service amen it's wonderful to see
[53:39] the gifts being used
[53:41] and then the sacrifices made and the
[53:43] worship and the atmosphere that it
[53:44] creates amen
[53:46] i really enjoy that tape on on on
[53:48] wednesday night
[53:50] really jumped out of me that part about
[53:51] the receipt and i never heard that
[53:52] before where he said it was
[53:54] proof that the price had been paid the
[53:57] sacrifice accepted and because of that
[53:59] we stand justified
[54:00] this morning amen and justified doesn't
[54:03] mean it's as if you never did it brother
[54:04] brahm says
[54:05] you never did it in the first place amen
[54:08] what a place to stand you never
[54:10] did it satan has nothing he can bring
[54:12] against you you never did it in the
[54:14] first place
[54:14] amen the price is fully paid it's in the
[54:16] sea of god's forgetfulness and if he
[54:18] can't remember it
[54:19] then satan is a liar amen if it doesn't
[54:22] exist in god's world it doesn't exist
[54:24] amen so when satan brings it against us
[54:26] he's he's reading from a pack of lies
[54:28] that he's put together amen against the
[54:29] brethren
[54:30] against the the bride of christ amen
[54:32] first kings
[54:33] chapter 20 and we're going to start
[54:36] reading
[54:37] verse 13 if you would keep your bibles
[54:39] open this morning we'll see how the how
[54:41] the screen works if
[54:42] brother matt thinks he might have a way
[54:43] to to get this going but if not you'll
[54:45] need your bibles close by man first
[54:47] kings chapter 20
[54:49] and verse 13 we're going to read a story
[54:50] this morning that says and behold there
[54:52] came a prophet
[54:53] unto ahab king of israel saying thus
[54:55] saith the lord
[54:56] hast thou seen all this great multitude
[54:59] behold i will deliver it
[55:00] into thine hand this day and thou shalt
[55:02] know that i am the lord
[55:04] and ahab said by whom and he said thus
[55:06] saith the lord even by the young men of
[55:08] the princes of the provinces
[55:10] then he said who shall order the battle
[55:12] and he answered thou
[55:15] and then he numbered the young men of
[55:16] the princes of the province and they
[55:18] were 232
[55:19] and after them he numbered all the
[55:21] people even all the children of israel
[55:23] being seven thousand and they went out
[55:25] at noon but ben hadad was drinking
[55:27] himself drunk in the pavilions he and
[55:29] the kings
[55:30] the thirty and two kings that helped him
[55:32] and the young men of the provinces of
[55:34] the princes of the provinces went out
[55:35] first
[55:36] and ben hayden sent out and they told
[55:38] him saying there are men come out of
[55:40] samaria
[55:41] and he said whether they come out for
[55:42] peace take them alive or whether they be
[55:45] out for war
[55:45] be come out for war take them alive
[55:49] so these young men of the princes of the
[55:50] provinces came out of the city in the
[55:52] army which followed them
[55:53] and they slew everyone his man and the
[55:56] syrians fled
[55:57] and israel pursued them and ben ben had
[56:00] the king of syria escaped on a horse
[56:02] with the horsemen and the king of israel
[56:04] went out and smote the horses and
[56:06] chariots and slew the syrians with a
[56:08] great slaughter
[56:09] and the prophet came to the king of
[56:10] israel and said unto him
[56:12] go strengthen thyself and mark
[56:16] and see what thou doest for at the
[56:18] return of the year
[56:19] the king of syria shall come up against
[56:22] thee amen may god add his
[56:24] blessing to the reading of his word you
[56:25] can have your seats this morning
[56:27] amen for this morning we want to take a
[56:29] title of go strengthen thyself
[56:31] amen and uh this is one of the most
[56:33] interesting battle stories in the
[56:34] scripture because we've got some
[56:36] interesting players here with some
[56:37] interesting conditions in their life
[56:39] and it's it's a beautiful picture to see
[56:41] the grace of god in
[56:42] in something like this and and how he
[56:44] just works and moves and people amen
[56:47] certainly had a tremendous service on
[56:49] sunday and i want to thank the lord for
[56:50] that
[56:50] that's always the sovereign move of god
[56:52] when he moves on people's hearts
[56:54] when he has a message prepared but not
[56:56] only a message prepared but of people
[56:58] ready to receive and act on it amen and
[57:00] god's always mindful of the needs of his
[57:02] children amen those things don't happen
[57:04] because
[57:04] we're sitting at home doing nothing but
[57:06] he looks on us he sees our needs he sees
[57:08] our hearts
[57:09] he sees what's going on in our lives he
[57:11] sees the weaknesses that are there
[57:12] he sees the strengths that need to be
[57:14] brought to the forefront he knows what
[57:15] you're thinking about he knows what
[57:16] you're feeling
[57:17] and then he comes in and he brings his
[57:19] word to deliver you amen
[57:20] he brings his word to strengthen you to
[57:22] encourage you amen
[57:24] amen but i want to share something with
[57:26] you and that's that when you come and
[57:28] respond to the word
[57:29] that's a that's a foresight that's an
[57:31] insight into what god has been thinking
[57:33] about you amen
[57:34] when there's something that comes out it
[57:36] doesn't just show that you're thinking
[57:37] about god but it shows that he's
[57:38] thinking about you amen that he's got a
[57:40] purpose and a plan and he's got a desire
[57:42] for you and it's a good thing for you
[57:44] and then he's got an expected end for
[57:46] you
[57:46] and when you come and you step forward
[57:48] it just gives you a glimpse into the
[57:49] mind of god
[57:50] and what he's thinking about you for
[57:51] that particular time amen we know the
[57:54] scripture says no man comes to god
[57:55] except the father draw him first
[57:57] and even as a child of god god is
[57:59] constantly drawing us and pulling us to
[58:01] his word
[58:02] pulling us to himself and when we
[58:04] respond like that it gives him an
[58:05] opportunity to open up more and more and
[58:07] more of our lives amen
[58:09] it starts to bring us closer and closer
[58:11] to him and he can have a greater and
[58:12] greater effect in our lives amen amen
[58:14] we're believers amen and at the core of
[58:17] a believer the nature of a believer is
[58:19] to believe
[58:19] and it's not just to believe anything
[58:21] but it's to believe the word of god
[58:23] amen and as the holy spirit ignites your
[58:25] heart as it quickens these things
[58:26] then as believers we want to step
[58:28] forward we want to step into the
[58:30] promises of god we want to step into the
[58:31] channel of god we want to step into the
[58:33] moving of god
[58:34] and say lord here i am what would you
[58:36] have your servant to do amen
[58:38] sometimes it's surrender sometimes it's
[58:40] repentance sometimes it's just
[58:42] to stand for somebody else whatever the
[58:43] case may be but we're saying lord we're
[58:45] gonna stand and step into your word and
[58:47] whatever your purpose is for me
[58:49] we're going to do that amen amen but the
[58:52] the thing about great
[58:53] services like that is that the question
[58:56] is always
[58:57] what next amen services like that don't
[59:00] happen every day
[59:02] right and it's not meant to happen every
[59:04] day amen there are cycles in life and
[59:06] there's certain situations it's like in
[59:07] life it's kind of like if you lived your
[59:09] your entire marriage the way you were
[59:11] when you first met and fell in love with
[59:13] your spouse
[59:14] if you lived your entire life with your
[59:16] heart rate amped up all the time and not
[59:17] being able to think straight and doing
[59:19] silly things like we do when we're
[59:21] we're twitter painted then you go
[59:22] through life and you'll be useless amen
[59:24] but there are moments of passion there
[59:26] are there are moments there where you
[59:27] just are so connected with your spouse
[59:29] and it's a great thing and you take that
[59:31] and you build on it don't you and you
[59:32] use that to take your your relationship
[59:34] to the next level and it gives you grace
[59:36] then when things aren't so good and
[59:38] she doesn't make the meal quite the way
[59:39] you want it and he doesn't pick up his
[59:41] clothes and put him in the clothes
[59:42] hamper and these different things right
[59:43] those things they help keep you going
[59:45] and that they kind of give you just
[59:46] little landmarks little
[59:47] little pushes to keep you going in the
[59:49] in the relationship amen
[59:51] the other thing is it's really easy to
[59:53] be brave in a crowd of people when the
[59:55] the lord is moving the presence of the
[59:57] holy spirit is here remember when you're
[59:59] at home and it's just
[1:00:00] you and the four walls it's a way
[1:00:01] different situation isn't it
[1:00:03] when it's just you and your thoughts
[1:00:05] it's just you and whatever it is that's
[1:00:06] been bothering you that comes back
[1:00:08] around and starts knocking on the door
[1:00:09] that's a whole different animal than
[1:00:11] when we're in a service and everybody's
[1:00:12] on
[1:00:13] you know they're at your back and the
[1:00:14] preacher's praying and the people are
[1:00:16] singing and
[1:00:17] the atmosphere is so heavy but when you
[1:00:19] go home now
[1:00:20] it's it's going to be different and that
[1:00:21] doesn't matter if you have the holy
[1:00:23] spirit or not
[1:00:23] it's just you and whatever you are
[1:00:25] facing whatever you're talking about
[1:00:26] whatever you're claiming whatever you're
[1:00:28] looking for the expectation the healing
[1:00:30] deliverance whatever it might be
[1:00:32] it's just you and that now right amen
[1:00:34] and we've got to be able to move in
[1:00:35] and be able to step past the great
[1:00:37] service step past the moving of the holy
[1:00:39] spirit in the service
[1:00:40] and look for the lord to move in our
[1:00:42] lives individually amen
[1:00:44] amen so let's walk down this road of
[1:00:46] growth strengthen thyself and
[1:00:47] this story is all about two kings and
[1:00:49] it's about ben haydad the king of syria
[1:00:51] and he is an idolater but he's a tool of
[1:00:54] god
[1:00:54] that's one thing the syrians and brother
[1:00:56] paul and i were talking about this he
[1:00:57] was talking mostly
[1:00:58] about how god used the syrians
[1:01:01] no that's a good thing you know it's a
[1:01:04] good thing he was talking about how
[1:01:05] syria was a hand it was a tool in the
[1:01:07] hand of god on a regular basis
[1:01:09] to chide israel and to correct them and
[1:01:11] to show them that they were out of the
[1:01:12] will and plan of god amen
[1:01:14] so you have a king here that has no
[1:01:15] right to the land but god's using him
[1:01:18] for something and then you have ahab
[1:01:19] and ahab is one of the worst kings
[1:01:21] because not only is he
[1:01:23] a a backslidden believer or maybe even a
[1:01:25] rank unbeliever but he's brought it into
[1:01:27] the kingdom through marriage and he's
[1:01:28] allowed his wife to wrap him around her
[1:01:30] little finger
[1:01:31] and bring idolatry into the nation to
[1:01:33] the point where there's only seven
[1:01:35] thousand believers left
[1:01:36] in the entire nation and then he's
[1:01:38] ruling through idolatry rather than
[1:01:40] through
[1:01:41] a a one true god amen and so you've got
[1:01:43] these two kings now coming to battle
[1:01:45] and what happened with this is ben hayda
[1:01:47] comes up to samaria
[1:01:49] and he he he surrounds the city and he
[1:01:51] says everything you have is mine
[1:01:53] your gold your silver your wives and
[1:01:55] your children
[1:01:56] and ahab says okay then
[1:01:59] hey that says okay not only that
[1:02:03] but tomorrow my servants get to walk
[1:02:05] through your city
[1:02:06] and they get to go in anybody's house
[1:02:08] and whatever they see that they like
[1:02:10] they get to take it
[1:02:12] so adding insult to injury and the funny
[1:02:14] thing is this is when ahab says
[1:02:16] no you know give up your gold your
[1:02:19] silver your wife and your children
[1:02:20] yeah you can have that but take whatever
[1:02:22] else you have in your house he says no
[1:02:23] no no that's too much
[1:02:25] i mean what what a condition this man is
[1:02:27] in that he maybe he's got something
[1:02:28] hidden there that he really doesn't want
[1:02:29] to lose
[1:02:30] he's willing to lose his family he's
[1:02:32] willing to lose his wealth but he's got
[1:02:33] these little hidden things that he just
[1:02:35] doesn't want to let go
[1:02:36] he'll let the things that matter most go
[1:02:38] but he's got these little tiny things
[1:02:39] here
[1:02:40] maybe he's got this beautiful art that
[1:02:41] he's really attached to you know willing
[1:02:43] to let your wife and children go
[1:02:45] but you can't have my art this is a
[1:02:47] condition that he's in now amen
[1:02:50] and then ahab says sorry you can't do it
[1:02:52] you're gonna have to come take it
[1:02:53] you know bring it on and he's got no
[1:02:55] army to fight
[1:02:56] he's got no way of getting out of this
[1:02:57] but he says we're gonna fight to the
[1:02:59] last man
[1:02:59] because i'm not willing to let you take
[1:03:01] absolutely everything from me
[1:03:03] so let's start again in verse 13. we're
[1:03:05] going to walk through this and and
[1:03:06] really set a picture here and try and
[1:03:07] put ourselves into this this morning so
[1:03:09] first kings 20 verse 13.
[1:03:11] so this is where this is this is kind of
[1:03:13] the preface to what we're going to read
[1:03:15] in verse 13. so ahab said all right
[1:03:16] we're going to fight for what we have
[1:03:18] now
[1:03:18] because you went that far now you can't
[1:03:20] take anything but he's a backslidden
[1:03:22] king
[1:03:23] with no army really and so verse 13 says
[1:03:26] and behold there came a prophet unto
[1:03:28] ahab the king of israel saying thus
[1:03:29] saith
[1:03:30] the lord hast thou seen all this great
[1:03:32] multitude behold
[1:03:33] i will deliver it into thine hand this
[1:03:35] day and thou shalt know that i am the
[1:03:37] lord.
[1:03:38] now there's a couple things i want you
[1:03:39] to catch here ahab is a king
[1:03:41] but he's not a godly king he doesn't
[1:03:44] worship jehovah he's married to an
[1:03:45] idolater amen
[1:03:46] elijah has already killed off all the
[1:03:48] prophets of baal
[1:03:50] this is after the mount carmel showdown
[1:03:52] so this is not like ahab before he
[1:03:54] became a bad king
[1:03:55] this is ahab firmly in the grasp of
[1:03:57] idolatry firmly wrapped around the
[1:03:59] finger of his wife
[1:04:00] there's there's no coming back for ahab
[1:04:02] like he's committed to his path if you
[1:04:04] look in the scriptures amen he's a bad
[1:04:06] king he's a weak king
[1:04:07] he's he's willing to send his family out
[1:04:10] to save his own wealth
[1:04:12] okay not a good guy amen but yet god
[1:04:15] comes looking
[1:04:16] to bring salvation why because they're
[1:04:18] the children of israel they're the
[1:04:19] children of promise
[1:04:21] and he's coming to this backslidden king
[1:04:22] and he says look i'm going to do
[1:04:24] something for you but it's not for you
[1:04:27] it's to prove that i'm the lord it's to
[1:04:29] prove that god is still alive in your
[1:04:31] midst
[1:04:31] and even though you don't believe it i'm
[1:04:33] going to do this just for you you
[1:04:34] backslidden king
[1:04:36] right because he's got 7 000 believers
[1:04:38] that are going to be affected by this
[1:04:40] as well he's not protecting ahab he's
[1:04:42] protecting the believers that are
[1:04:43] serving the one true god amen
[1:04:45] but he comes to that backslidden king
[1:04:46] and says look i'm going to do something
[1:04:48] to prove i'm still god regardless of
[1:04:50] what you've done
[1:04:51] ahabs or or elijah showed you
[1:04:54] that i'm a real god that the gods you're
[1:04:56] serving are not real but i'm going to
[1:04:57] come down and i'm going to save you but
[1:04:58] it's going to be for somebody else amen
[1:05:01] and it is about god amen it's not about
[1:05:03] ahab
[1:05:05] so if god's coming down to a backslidden
[1:05:07] idolatrous king what about his children
[1:05:10] amen if you if you're standing here and
[1:05:12] you say well i've done this and i've
[1:05:13] done that and i'm not here and i'm not
[1:05:15] there
[1:05:15] if god's going to come to ahab he
[1:05:17] doesn't have any problem coming to his
[1:05:18] children if he'll come to the
[1:05:20] backsliding idolater
[1:05:21] he'll come to the backslidden children
[1:05:22] amen he'll come to the ones that aren't
[1:05:24] quite where they ought to be
[1:05:25] the ones that aren't quite as mature as
[1:05:26] they need to be the ones that aren't
[1:05:27] quite serving him the way they're
[1:05:29] supposed to
[1:05:30] amen if he's gracious to the backslidden
[1:05:32] one that isn't his child
[1:05:33] he's going to be gracious to the one
[1:05:35] that is his child no matter their
[1:05:36] condition amen
[1:05:39] verse 14 says and ahab said by whom so
[1:05:42] he says lord you're going to deliver
[1:05:43] them into our hand but whose hand
[1:05:45] and he said thus saith the lord even by
[1:05:47] the young men of the princes of the
[1:05:49] provinces
[1:05:50] and then he said who shall order the
[1:05:51] battle and he answered thou so in other
[1:05:53] words who'll bring the victory who's
[1:05:55] going to win the battle and he says it's
[1:05:56] the bodyguards
[1:05:58] of the princes of samaria so the princes
[1:06:00] of samaria each have their own retinue
[1:06:02] of guards
[1:06:03] and they're the ones that are going to
[1:06:04] lead the battle so they're the ones that
[1:06:06] are going to be the spear tip of god's
[1:06:08] victories he's going to send out these
[1:06:09] young
[1:06:10] warriors these young bodyguards and
[1:06:12] they're going to be the tip of the army
[1:06:14] and then he says who's going to command
[1:06:16] the army though and he says
[1:06:18] ahab you're going to because you're the
[1:06:19] king the king commands the army
[1:06:21] but the victory's going to come through
[1:06:22] the young men that are leading this army
[1:06:24] they're not under your command they go
[1:06:26] out and then you bring the army after
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:29] verse 15 says then he numbered the young
[1:06:31] man of the princes of the
[1:06:32] provinces so the bodyguards and there
[1:06:34] were 232
[1:06:36] and after them he numbered all the
[1:06:37] people even all the children of israel
[1:06:39] being 7 000 232 men
[1:06:43] are going to put the enemy on the run
[1:06:45] gideon had 300.
[1:06:47] right 232 young men on their own
[1:06:51] stick them out in front and then
[1:06:52] whatever happens the army's supposed to
[1:06:53] follow after them with ahab amen
[1:06:55] and then they've got 7 000 men and
[1:06:57] they're facing an army that is massive
[1:06:59] absolutely massive we know it's over
[1:07:01] well over a hundred thousand 127 000 is
[1:07:04] what they're facing here
[1:07:05] and they've got 7 000 plus 232 7
[1:07:09] 232 men against 121 thousand they got to
[1:07:12] kill 300 each
[1:07:14] that's right right that's tough odds
[1:07:17] even with a even with machine guns
[1:07:20] that's tough odds right 300 to 1.
[1:07:24] 16. i love this and they went out at
[1:07:28] noon
[1:07:29] the young men don't sit back and say hey
[1:07:31] hey we promised to protect you we did
[1:07:33] not promise to give our lives stupidly
[1:07:35] against an army of 127 000 men
[1:07:39] it says they went out at noon but the
[1:07:41] beautiful thing is ben hadad was
[1:07:43] drinking himself drunk in the pavilions
[1:07:45] he and the kings
[1:07:46] the thirty and two kings that helped him
[1:07:48] so this is a done deal for ben haydad
[1:07:51] as soon as the army comes out of the
[1:07:52] city he knows we've got them
[1:07:55] they've got no walls to knock down now
[1:07:56] it's just going to be one on one
[1:07:58] 7 232 versus 127
[1:08:01] 000. it's not even going to be a
[1:08:03] challenge so they're sitting there
[1:08:04] having a party
[1:08:05] and israel comes out for battle and the
[1:08:08] young men of the princes of the province
[1:08:09] went out first
[1:08:10] and ben had sent out and they told him
[1:08:12] saying these men are come out of samaria
[1:08:14] so they said hey there's something
[1:08:15] happening here
[1:08:16] verse 18 and he said whether they come
[1:08:18] out for peace take them alive
[1:08:20] or whether they be come out for war take
[1:08:21] them alive so what he's saying is
[1:08:23] surround them
[1:08:25] give them a chance to lay down their
[1:08:26] weapons and then we'll bring them in
[1:08:27] we'll have a talk and see what this is
[1:08:28] all about
[1:08:29] you know are they being foolish or they
[1:08:30] come out to to maybe offer a surrender
[1:08:32] maybe talk about conditions for
[1:08:34] surrender
[1:08:34] he says bring him in don't kill him we
[1:08:36] want to talk to him just surround
[1:08:38] him and take them into me verse 19. so
[1:08:40] these young men of the princes of the
[1:08:42] province came out of the city in the
[1:08:43] army which followed them
[1:08:45] and they slew everyone his man and the
[1:08:48] syrians fled
[1:08:49] and israel pursued them and ben hayden
[1:08:51] the king of syria escaped on a horse
[1:08:53] with the horsemen
[1:08:55] so they go to surround them and every
[1:08:57] one of those bodyguards picks the guy
[1:08:59] nearest to him and kills them
[1:09:00] and then they start moving in and they
[1:09:02] start mowing everybody down
[1:09:03] and the whole army of israel comes in
[1:09:05] and one thing they say about armies is
[1:09:07] once they start moving
[1:09:08] in whatever direction they're moving you
[1:09:10] can't stop it
[1:09:12] right so once they start to retreat then
[1:09:14] the whole army starts to retreat
[1:09:16] regardless of whether they've been
[1:09:17] beaten or not
[1:09:18] the movement is away and so these young
[1:09:20] men drive them back and then everybody
[1:09:22] starts running and israel has a heyday
[1:09:24] and they just start putting them all on
[1:09:25] the running man verse 21 and the king of
[1:09:28] israel went out and smote the horses and
[1:09:30] chariots
[1:09:31] and slew of the syrians with a great
[1:09:32] slaughter seven thousand two hundred
[1:09:34] thirty two against 127 000
[1:09:36] they beat him amen beat him with a great
[1:09:38] slaughter
[1:09:39] amen that's right okay i want you to
[1:09:41] mention here it says he smelt the horses
[1:09:43] and chariots but israel doesn't have
[1:09:45] horses and chariots
[1:09:46] right they're up against a vastly
[1:09:49] they're vastly outnumbered by a superior
[1:09:51] force
[1:09:52] they don't have a hope here they don't
[1:09:54] have the kind of weapons they don't have
[1:09:55] the technology
[1:09:56] they don't have the training they have
[1:09:57] none of this all they have is people
[1:09:59] that are doing what god said to do
[1:10:01] and then they go out and they wreck a
[1:10:03] clearly superior force
[1:10:05] amen i want to stop there and say we are
[1:10:08] fighting a clearly superior force
[1:10:11] amen when we look at ourselves and we
[1:10:12] compare it against the army that's
[1:10:14] that's coming against us we don't have
[1:10:17] what it takes to defeat this force
[1:10:19] amen when we go up with it with our
[1:10:21] experience with our intellect with our
[1:10:22] thoughts with our ideas with our own
[1:10:24] strength with our own discipline
[1:10:26] we cannot defeat satan that way amen for
[1:10:28] one we're not fighting in the flesh so
[1:10:30] we're never
[1:10:30] and and all of our strength is in the
[1:10:32] flesh so that's never going to happen
[1:10:34] but regardless we're fighting satan with
[1:10:36] tools of his own making
[1:10:37] and he's always going to defeat us
[1:10:39] because he's got the numbers he's got
[1:10:40] the experience he's got the age
[1:10:42] to beat us amen if we're using his
[1:10:44] weapons he's going to beat us every
[1:10:45] single time
[1:10:47] brother braham said this in the conflict
[1:10:48] between god and satan he says satan is
[1:10:50] more than a match for us
[1:10:52] we know that we know that satan is way
[1:10:55] more than a match for any human being
[1:10:57] and i guarantee you as believers at some
[1:10:59] point in your life you've tried to do
[1:11:00] something on your own
[1:11:02] and you failed miserably just as i have
[1:11:04] time and time again until you say lord
[1:11:07] the battle is not mine the battle is
[1:11:08] yours i'm going to let you do this work
[1:11:11] i'm going to let you bring me through
[1:11:12] this
[1:11:13] and all of a sudden we've got victory
[1:11:14] where there is no more victory
[1:11:17] we know that satan is way more than a
[1:11:18] match for any human being
[1:11:20] don't you never try and do it with your
[1:11:22] wisdom or outsmart him
[1:11:24] you just can't do it our natural
[1:11:26] condition is what born and sin shaped
[1:11:28] and iniquity come to the world's
[1:11:29] speaking lives we're dead in our own
[1:11:31] trespasses and we can't defeat satan in
[1:11:33] that condition
[1:11:34] you've got to be changed you've got to
[1:11:35] have a new birth you've got to have a
[1:11:37] new life within you
[1:11:38] that gives you a new set of weapons to
[1:11:40] defeat satan because the ones you're
[1:11:41] born with are the ones that we fell by
[1:11:43] in the first place amen
[1:11:45] we won't even slow satan down you can't
[1:11:47] even slow satan down on your own and if
[1:11:49] you think that's not true go look in the
[1:11:50] world because that's what they're
[1:11:51] fighting
[1:11:52] if anything they're fighting with
[1:11:53] satan's own tools and it doesn't slow
[1:11:54] him down at all he's the master of them
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:57] amen we need new weapons we need a new
[1:11:59] identity we need a new way of fighting
[1:12:01] and if we can get those then all of a
[1:12:02] sudden we can defeat satan amen
[1:12:04] amen romans 8 35 says who shall separate
[1:12:07] us from the love of christ
[1:12:08] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:12:10] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:12:12] peril or sword
[1:12:14] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:12:16] killed all the day long and we are
[1:12:17] accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:12:19] amen
[1:12:19] now they're in an age where they're
[1:12:21] dying physically they're giving their
[1:12:22] lives for the gospel
[1:12:24] but here we're accounted as sheep for
[1:12:25] the slaughter if we go in on our own
[1:12:27] strength
[1:12:28] satan's going to he's going to wipe us
[1:12:30] out but verse 37 says nay
[1:12:33] in all these things we are more than
[1:12:35] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:12:38] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:12:40] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:12:42] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:12:44] to come nor height nor death nor
[1:12:46] any other creature shall be able to
[1:12:48] separate us from the love of god which
[1:12:50] is in jesus christ our lord
[1:12:52] so we are conquerors through christ in
[1:12:54] christ alone
[1:12:55] amen we are not in ourselves conquerors
[1:12:57] but we are conquerors through christ
[1:12:58] amen and we're celebrating
[1:13:00] that victory this morning when he rose
[1:13:02] from the dead and he held the keys
[1:13:04] to death hell and the grave that made us
[1:13:06] victors over everything that satan came
[1:13:07] against us with amen
[1:13:09] brother i was listening to ron spencer
[1:13:11] last night and he was talking about how
[1:13:13] you know satan had a demon watching over
[1:13:15] the body of jesus
[1:13:16] he this is a story i mean it's not not
[1:13:18] necessarily true but
[1:13:20] you know he's dramatizing and satan's
[1:13:22] saying to satan
[1:13:23] the body's still there yes sir still
[1:13:25] here hasn't moved
[1:13:27] next day body's still there yes sir
[1:13:30] hasn't moved and then he says on that
[1:13:33] resurrection morning all of a sudden
[1:13:35] jesus starts walking out
[1:13:37] and the saints are walking with him and
[1:13:40] satan's on his phone texting as he's
[1:13:42] still there
[1:13:44] and the demon says he's gone hallelujah
[1:13:47] he's gone
[1:13:48] and satan's saying we've got a problem
[1:13:49] down here because the rest of them are
[1:13:51] leaving with them
[1:13:52] amen and that's the victory we're
[1:13:54] celebrating this morning is that he
[1:13:55] didn't just rise
[1:13:56] but he brought everyone with them that
[1:13:58] had put their life and their trust in
[1:13:59] him amen
[1:14:00] and so when we talk about victory we're
[1:14:02] in christ we rose with him
[1:14:04] as we die with him we rose with him and
[1:14:06] that put every
[1:14:07] everything under our feet amen
[1:14:10] everything that satan brings is under
[1:14:11] our feet because we're in christ not
[1:14:13] because we're in ourselves amen
[1:14:16] i want to continue that quote i just
[1:14:18] said where he said that satan
[1:14:20] we are that satan is way more than a
[1:14:21] match for any human being
[1:14:23] that's a horrible thing to say brother
[1:14:24] jonathan listen to this he says jesus
[1:14:26] knew this so he sent to the church
[1:14:29] so that satan would not outstart them
[1:14:31] outsmart them
[1:14:32] a place to be fortified so he sent them
[1:14:35] the holy ghost
[1:14:36] and the church does not claim to be
[1:14:38] smart they claim to believe
[1:14:41] amen they claim to believe because the
[1:14:43] holy spirit in them quickens the word
[1:14:44] for their day
[1:14:45] and all of a sudden they are doing the
[1:14:47] greater works brother branham i was
[1:14:48] listening to that day at calvary he says
[1:14:50] the greater works is to impart eternal
[1:14:52] life to others
[1:14:54] i don't give you the holy ghost i give
[1:14:56] you the way to get the holy ghost amen
[1:14:58] repent and be baptized for the remission
[1:15:00] of sins and you shall receive the
[1:15:02] baptism of the holy ghost whatsoever you
[1:15:04] bind on earth will be bound in heaven
[1:15:05] and whatsoever you loose
[1:15:07] back and forth up and down whichever way
[1:15:09] you want it you want a bond you want to
[1:15:10] lose
[1:15:11] all power is given to you to do it amen
[1:15:13] impart eternal life to those you come in
[1:15:15] in contact with amen so our
[1:15:17] fortification brother branham says is
[1:15:19] the holy spirit
[1:15:20] and our weapon is faith to believe amen
[1:15:24] we're not stomping around we don't go
[1:15:25] around yelling war cries and taunting
[1:15:27] satan
[1:15:28] right that is not our places to go
[1:15:30] around our place is to stand our ground
[1:15:33] and when he comes in we beat him so
[1:15:35] badly that he doesn't ever want to come
[1:15:37] back again
[1:15:38] that he's in the hospital recovering
[1:15:40] they got to keep sending new demons
[1:15:41] because they get beat up so badly every
[1:15:43] time they come at us
[1:15:44] it would be a beautiful thing that satan
[1:15:46] would be the one that is frustrated on a
[1:15:48] daily basis amen
[1:15:49] and the bride of christ will frustrate
[1:15:51] satan on a daily basis amen
[1:15:54] amen we stand our ground we've talked a
[1:15:56] lot about walking
[1:15:58] in the last little while but now we're
[1:15:59] talking about a message that tells you
[1:16:01] to stand your ground
[1:16:02] when you've walked to where you're
[1:16:03] supposed to be stay there
[1:16:05] and don't let anybody in amen stand your
[1:16:07] ground don't back up amen
[1:16:10] says in every man or woman that has an
[1:16:12] experience with god has met the same
[1:16:14] pillar of fire
[1:16:15] upon the sacred grounds of your heart
[1:16:17] there's no theology theologian no devil
[1:16:19] no nothing paul said nothing present
[1:16:21] nothing future
[1:16:22] death sickness or sorrow can separate us
[1:16:24] from that love of god
[1:16:26] that's in christ jesus he says it's a
[1:16:28] tie post
[1:16:29] you know something happened no matter
[1:16:32] how much science raises up
[1:16:34] and says this that or the other you are
[1:16:36] tied
[1:16:37] you've got to have a place where you
[1:16:38] anchor your experience with god
[1:16:40] i love the story of sister barnes that
[1:16:42] brother gerald tells
[1:16:44] you know where he says what happened
[1:16:45] satan finally hit
[1:16:47] ground zero right where she was sealed
[1:16:51] and when he hits that it's like brother
[1:16:52] bran said
[1:16:53] what a live wire and he gets 20 000
[1:16:56] volts through his body because he
[1:16:57] finally hits where that life is
[1:16:59] he's worked through all the emotions and
[1:17:00] the ideas and the thoughts and he's hit
[1:17:02] the holy spirit that sealed her soul
[1:17:04] and all of a sudden the jolt hits him
[1:17:06] and he starts stepping back and that's
[1:17:07] your boo devil moment amen when he hits
[1:17:09] the thai post
[1:17:10] that's when he makes the mistake amen
[1:17:14] he says you and god become one he's in
[1:17:16] you you are in him
[1:17:18] at that day you'll know i'm in the
[1:17:19] father the father me i
[1:17:21] and you and you and me you are tied to
[1:17:23] him
[1:17:24] he says paul had a christ-centered life
[1:17:26] it was a different life than once he had
[1:17:29] he once had an educational conception
[1:17:33] we know a lot about the message we know
[1:17:34] a lot about christ we know a lot about
[1:17:36] the word for our day
[1:17:37] he says but now he's got a
[1:17:39] christ-centered life
[1:17:41] an absolute is it it's the new birthday
[1:17:45] amen the the thai post the anchor that
[1:17:47] we have is
[1:17:48] our new birth which is when we receive
[1:17:49] the holy spirit amen our new birth is
[1:17:51] not when we say lord i accept
[1:17:53] it's lord when i receive that is our new
[1:17:56] birth
[1:17:56] because if you still have the old life
[1:17:58] in you how can you have a new birth
[1:18:00] you have to have a new life and that is
[1:18:02] the life of god which is the holy spirit
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:04] and that way when satan comes and beats
[1:18:06] on you no matter how far he pushes
[1:18:08] eventually he's going to hit that that
[1:18:10] what do they call it the the bedrock
[1:18:12] right when you build a foundation
[1:18:13] there's bedrock and when you hit bedrock
[1:18:15] you don't go any deeper that's the firm
[1:18:16] foundation and when he hits that holy
[1:18:18] spirit
[1:18:18] when he hits that sealed soul he can't
[1:18:20] go any further and he stopped dead in
[1:18:22] his tracks and all of a sudden you start
[1:18:23] pushing back amen
[1:18:26] ephesians 6 12 says for we wrestle not
[1:18:28] against flesh and blood
[1:18:29] but against principalities against
[1:18:30] powers against the rulers of the
[1:18:32] darkness of this world
[1:18:33] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:18:35] places
[1:18:36] that's quite an order that's quite an
[1:18:38] army that's placed against us
[1:18:41] he says wherefore take under you the
[1:18:43] whole armor of god
[1:18:44] that ye may be with able to withstand in
[1:18:46] the evil day
[1:18:48] and having done all to stand
[1:18:51] so you're not going to stand if you
[1:18:52] don't take what he's given you but after
[1:18:55] you've taken what he's given you then
[1:18:56] stand
[1:18:57] after you've done everything you can
[1:18:59] stand
[1:19:00] don't move stand don't fall back don't
[1:19:02] turn your back
[1:19:03] stand stand stand right don't walk back
[1:19:07] your belief don't walk back from your
[1:19:08] promise don't walk back from your
[1:19:10] confession
[1:19:11] stand on what he's given you and take
[1:19:14] everything he's given you to armor
[1:19:15] yourself fortify yourself in the holy
[1:19:17] spirit
[1:19:18] do not negotiate do not second best do
[1:19:20] not second guess do not have a
[1:19:22] conversation about it
[1:19:23] stand your ground resist him and he will
[1:19:26] flee from you amen
[1:19:29] satan always wants to have a talk
[1:19:31] satan's a talker and you see it from the
[1:19:33] very first
[1:19:34] time in eden satan wants to have a
[1:19:37] conversation
[1:19:38] and it's usually about the word but it's
[1:19:40] a twisted word
[1:19:41] because he did the same thing with jesus
[1:19:43] amen he wanted to have a conversation
[1:19:45] about the word didn't he
[1:19:46] satan always comes in he wants to have a
[1:19:48] little chat about what just happened
[1:19:50] about what you're confessing about what
[1:19:52] you're believing right
[1:19:54] about the service that just happened and
[1:19:56] it always starts with hey that was
[1:19:57] pretty good wasn't it
[1:19:58] but but but are you sure
[1:20:01] right he's not coming in to build you up
[1:20:03] in the faith he's coming in to chip away
[1:20:05] at it bit by bit amen
[1:20:08] how do we know who's talking to us
[1:20:11] sometimes god does challenge us doesn't
[1:20:13] he
[1:20:14] but you got to judge it by the word and
[1:20:17] that's how you're going to know if it's
[1:20:18] satan that's talking or if it's god
[1:20:19] that's talking to you amen if it's the
[1:20:21] holy spirit or if you've got a demon
[1:20:22] that's trying to push in on you as you
[1:20:24] compare it to the word and say
[1:20:25] is he saying exactly what the word says
[1:20:28] in the balance of the word
[1:20:30] because he can quote the scripture but
[1:20:31] if it's out of balance and it's not put
[1:20:33] from genesis to revelation then satan's
[1:20:35] got a tool he can use against you if
[1:20:37] you're not ready for it amen
[1:20:38] amen brother brown said god has always
[1:20:40] respected any man who will stand first
[1:20:43] firm on his promise oh it looked like a
[1:20:45] dark time when shadrach meshach and
[1:20:47] abednego with their hands tied behind
[1:20:49] them
[1:20:49] and as it was the king said you know
[1:20:51] throne said now boys if you want to make
[1:20:53] a little compromising here
[1:20:55] and would like to change your decision
[1:20:57] we'll give you a chance
[1:20:59] but you know that doesn't belong a
[1:21:01] compromise in the heart of a believer
[1:21:04] who solemnly set on thus saith the lord
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:08] oft times the greatest challenge is not
[1:21:10] when you when you come up and you you
[1:21:11] confess or you're prayed for you're
[1:21:13] claiming your healing
[1:21:14] it's after right it's after that the
[1:21:17] real battle is
[1:21:18] a lot of times it's just getting the
[1:21:19] courage to come up maybe or to speak it
[1:21:21] out loud right
[1:21:22] but after that is when the battle is is
[1:21:24] will you hold your ground that you've
[1:21:26] taken
[1:21:26] will you stand where he's placed you and
[1:21:29] having done all
[1:21:30] put on what he's given you stand there
[1:21:32] amen amen amen
[1:21:34] and the problem is is when you're asking
[1:21:35] for or believing in something that you
[1:21:37] can't see
[1:21:38] because now you've got to go 100 percent
[1:21:40] by faith amen you can't feel what's
[1:21:42] happening in you
[1:21:43] you can't feel a change in your
[1:21:44] character you can't feel a change in
[1:21:46] your body necessarily
[1:21:48] but satan's going to come in and say
[1:21:50] well then it didn't happen
[1:21:51] you can't see it you can't feel it so
[1:21:53] nothing happened
[1:21:54] right and so what does he what's brother
[1:21:57] brand saying
[1:21:58] he say he'll give you an opportunity to
[1:21:59] change your mind walk back your
[1:22:01] experience
[1:22:02] walk back what just happened walk back
[1:22:04] your confession
[1:22:06] or maybe just take it back to say well i
[1:22:08] was looking for
[1:22:09] victory but i'll take a fall every once
[1:22:12] in a couple months
[1:22:13] i'll be okay with that because that's
[1:22:14] better than i was yesterday or last
[1:22:16] month or last year
[1:22:18] but that's compromise amen we're talking
[1:22:20] about total victory now
[1:22:22] we're not talking about just one victory
[1:22:23] but we're talking about a victory that
[1:22:25] takes us
[1:22:26] all the way through where satan is
[1:22:27] completely harmless where satan has no
[1:22:30] access to our lives amen
[1:22:32] a compromise doesn't exist in the heart
[1:22:33] of a believer brother branham said
[1:22:35] they won't step back they won't repent
[1:22:37] they won't take back their confession
[1:22:38] they won't take back their
[1:22:40] their profession and they will not
[1:22:41] negotiate to lesser the pain or the
[1:22:43] extent of the battle
[1:22:45] amen they will not back away israel wins
[1:22:48] a great victory here verse 22.
[1:22:50] okay so they're all celebrating yeah
[1:22:52] yeah we won we won
[1:22:54] the prophet came to the king of israel
[1:22:55] verse 22 and said to him
[1:22:57] go strengthen thyself and mark and see
[1:23:00] what thou doest for at the return of the
[1:23:02] year the king of syria will come up
[1:23:04] against thee great victory
[1:23:06] guess what he's coming again great
[1:23:09] victory he's coming again
[1:23:11] and again and again and again
[1:23:14] the amplified says the prophet came to
[1:23:16] the king of israel and said to him
[1:23:18] go fortify yourself and become strong
[1:23:21] and give attention to what you must do
[1:23:23] for at the first of next year the king
[1:23:25] of return
[1:23:25] of syria will return against you he says
[1:23:28] become strong
[1:23:29] he wasn't strong oft times when we're
[1:23:31] claiming victory we are not strong
[1:23:34] and it's god's grace it's god's
[1:23:35] sovereignty it's god's power that gives
[1:23:37] us the victory
[1:23:38] but he says become strong you need to
[1:23:41] step up here you've got to bring
[1:23:42] something to the next battle
[1:23:44] it's not going to be purely me next time
[1:23:46] you're going to have to do a work here
[1:23:48] you're going to have to obey the prophet
[1:23:49] here and strengthen yourself
[1:23:51] and watch because at the turn of the
[1:23:53] year he's going to come at you again
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:56] amen you won the battle but the war
[1:23:58] isn't finished
[1:23:59] they just won a battle against the
[1:24:00] heavily favored enemy with more people
[1:24:02] more technology more weapons
[1:24:04] horses and chariots all these things and
[1:24:06] he says they're coming at you again
[1:24:08] get ready for it amen but god doesn't
[1:24:10] say don't worry
[1:24:12] next time i'll do the exact same thing
[1:24:15] god won this victory 7232 against 127
[1:24:19] 000
[1:24:20] that was god's victory nobody would
[1:24:22] think otherwise but he doesn't say
[1:24:24] i'll do the same thing again now just
[1:24:25] sit back relax get fat and happy
[1:24:28] was he saying go prepare yourself go
[1:24:30] strengthen yourself don't sit back
[1:24:32] sharpen the swords get the armor ready
[1:24:34] get your shields ready
[1:24:35] add people to the army have scouts out
[1:24:38] looking for the enemy so that when he
[1:24:40] comes next time
[1:24:41] you aren't surprised but you're fully
[1:24:42] prepared for it amen
[1:24:44] after the victory is the time to prepare
[1:24:46] for the next battle
[1:24:48] that's the time to get your wounds
[1:24:49] healed up that's the time to get your
[1:24:50] fitness up
[1:24:51] that's the time to build yourself up in
[1:24:53] the face so that when he comes again
[1:24:55] you're ready for him the mountaintop is
[1:24:58] not where we get our growth
[1:25:00] nothing grows on the mountaintop it's
[1:25:02] snow and ice and wind
[1:25:04] right and little tiny liking you know
[1:25:06] what lycan are they're just little
[1:25:08] fuzz on rocks okay you're not getting
[1:25:10] anything that grows at the top of the
[1:25:11] mountain
[1:25:12] it's a wonderful experience you get a
[1:25:13] great view you get to enjoy the effort
[1:25:15] you just put in and then you got to go
[1:25:16] down and into the valley and climb
[1:25:18] another one amen
[1:25:20] because satan not off times he attacks
[1:25:23] but he doesn't always attack exactly
[1:25:24] what you're asking for
[1:25:26] a lot of times his attack is to distract
[1:25:27] you in another area
[1:25:29] so that he can get you running around
[1:25:30] there and then the chance is to come in
[1:25:32] and take what you originally had
[1:25:34] right because if satan can't beat you in
[1:25:35] one spot he's going to go after another
[1:25:37] spot and try and attack you there
[1:25:38] right he's going to shift his attack
[1:25:40] constantly and try and keep you off
[1:25:41] balance try and take victory away from
[1:25:42] one place
[1:25:43] when you've won it in another man he's
[1:25:45] going to try and take land that he
[1:25:46] hasn't had before to replace the land
[1:25:47] that you just took back from him amen
[1:25:51] amen if you're ready for the second
[1:25:53] attack it'll help you hold
[1:25:54] what you got the first time amen and
[1:25:57] god's giving israel a part to play here
[1:25:59] like i said he doesn't say i've got you
[1:26:00] covered next time they come in i'm going
[1:26:02] to do a miracle-working
[1:26:03] battle and once again you'll be
[1:26:04] victorious he gives them a natural part
[1:26:06] to play and guess what the thing is we
[1:26:09] are god's natural part to play in this
[1:26:10] battle
[1:26:11] amen right he works in men and women he
[1:26:13] works in the bride of christ he doesn't
[1:26:14] just sit up there
[1:26:15] and do all this thing in the heavens and
[1:26:17] speak things into existence
[1:26:19] no he he uses warriors he uses a bride
[1:26:22] group amen to beat satan on this earth
[1:26:25] so with us we have to do the same thing
[1:26:28] we have to strengthen ourselves after
[1:26:29] victory
[1:26:30] we have to build ourselves up in the
[1:26:31] faith we have to be ready for the next
[1:26:33] attack
[1:26:34] and sometimes the next attack is the
[1:26:35] next day isn't it brother chad
[1:26:38] sometimes it's the next week and
[1:26:39] sometimes you get a moment because
[1:26:41] satan's really got to build up a big one
[1:26:42] to get you
[1:26:44] but he's going to come again and you've
[1:26:45] got to be ready for it amen
[1:26:48] verse 23 the servants of the king of
[1:26:50] syria said unto him
[1:26:52] their gods are gods of the hills
[1:26:54] therefore they were stronger than we
[1:26:57] 7 232 against 127 000 because they're
[1:27:00] gods or gods of the hills
[1:27:02] but let us fight them again in the plane
[1:27:04] and surely we shall be stronger
[1:27:06] than they what is it satan doesn't
[1:27:09] defeat you in the hill so he takes it
[1:27:10] out to the plains
[1:27:12] right satan can't take away your victory
[1:27:13] over the healing of your body so what
[1:27:15] does he do he attacks your marriage
[1:27:17] he attacks situations in your job he
[1:27:19] attacks the leadership
[1:27:20] he says look god is a god of healing but
[1:27:22] he's not a god of relationships in
[1:27:24] marriage
[1:27:24] god is a provider but god's not a leader
[1:27:27] he's saying your god only works in
[1:27:29] certain areas you only have victory in
[1:27:31] certain parts of your life
[1:27:32] god's only good for limited things for
[1:27:34] you and we're going to take you on in a
[1:27:36] place where god has no strength in your
[1:27:38] life
[1:27:38] that's what he's saying he's saying your
[1:27:40] god is limited
[1:27:44] verse 24 and they said and do this thing
[1:27:47] take the kings away every man out of his
[1:27:49] place and put captains in their rooms
[1:27:51] they said the other problem was our
[1:27:52] leadership was horrible last time you
[1:27:53] guys were all drinking yourselves drunk
[1:27:56] when there was a battle to be fought
[1:27:57] they said kick the kings out
[1:28:00] build an army just like okay it's the
[1:28:02] next verse so take the kings out
[1:28:04] put captains in their place put men of
[1:28:06] war in their place
[1:28:08] not drunks put men that know how to
[1:28:10] fight
[1:28:11] give us the leadership we need and then
[1:28:13] we're going to beat them
[1:28:15] amen verse 25 says and number the army
[1:28:17] like the army thou has lost
[1:28:19] horsefull horse chariot for chariot and
[1:28:21] we will fight against them in the plane
[1:28:23] and surely we will be stronger than they
[1:28:25] and he hearkened under their voice and
[1:28:26] did so they said build the
[1:28:28] exact same army horse for horse chariot
[1:28:30] for chariot man for men
[1:28:32] another 127 000 of them
[1:28:35] it's a big army to rebuild but take it
[1:28:38] to the plane and we'll beat them in a
[1:28:39] new area
[1:28:40] they don't have protection out there
[1:28:41] their god doesn't work out here
[1:28:43] so we'll definitely get them this time
[1:28:45] amen
[1:28:48] verse 26 and it came to pass at the
[1:28:49] return of the year that ben hayden had
[1:28:51] numbered the syrians and went up to
[1:28:52] aphec to fight against israel
[1:28:54] the prophet was right they're going to
[1:28:55] come again verse 27 and the children of
[1:28:58] israel were numbered
[1:28:59] and were all present and went against
[1:29:01] them and the children of israel pitched
[1:29:03] before them like two little flocks of
[1:29:05] kids
[1:29:06] but the syrians filled the country
[1:29:09] i like that it says all of them were
[1:29:11] present
[1:29:12] they were all ready they had all heeded
[1:29:15] the word of the prophet the king had
[1:29:16] heeded the word of the prophet
[1:29:18] and all of the israelites were ready
[1:29:19] they were trained they had their weapons
[1:29:21] ready they had their armor ready and
[1:29:22] they were ready to go out for battle
[1:29:24] they answered the call amen they obeyed
[1:29:27] the word of the lord that came through
[1:29:28] the prophet
[1:29:29] amen that's where i want to be amen when
[1:29:32] he says prepare for battle i want to be
[1:29:34] prepared for battle
[1:29:34] and then when the battle comes
[1:29:36] regardless of what it looks like i want
[1:29:37] to step out and say all right
[1:29:39] i did my part i'm standing here lord use
[1:29:42] me
[1:29:43] amen but that wasn't enough
[1:29:46] for everything that they had done
[1:29:47] they're still staying in front the
[1:29:48] scripture says they were like two little
[1:29:50] flocks of kids
[1:29:51] they're like a little group of baby
[1:29:53] goats not even adult goats
[1:29:54] baby goats in front of this army amen so
[1:29:57] if anything it's worse than before
[1:30:00] baby goats fighting an army amen having
[1:30:02] done all to prepare themselves currently
[1:30:04] speaking there's still no match for the
[1:30:06] army that lays in front of them
[1:30:10] but the backslidden king had obeyed the
[1:30:11] lord and prepared the army and he'd done
[1:30:13] his portion amen
[1:30:14] that's all we have to do do our portion
[1:30:17] obey him
[1:30:18] obey him prepare yourself prepare for
[1:30:20] battle amen
[1:30:21] and then we look to him and say now the
[1:30:23] battle is yours lord
[1:30:24] we've done our part we're here for you
[1:30:26] to use use us as best you can amen amen
[1:30:30] verse 28 and there came a man of god and
[1:30:32] spake unto the king of israel and said
[1:30:34] thus
[1:30:34] saith the lord because the syrians have
[1:30:37] said the lord is god of the hills but he
[1:30:39] is not god of the valleys
[1:30:40] therefore will i deliver all this great
[1:30:42] multitude into thine hand and ye shall
[1:30:44] know that i am the lord
[1:30:46] israel didn't go out on the word of the
[1:30:48] prophet
[1:30:49] they went out because they had to fight
[1:30:51] and then the prophet then the man of the
[1:30:54] of god comes in and he says all right
[1:30:56] this one
[1:30:57] god has your back yet again because they
[1:31:00] have challenged me
[1:31:01] they haven't challenged you they've
[1:31:02] challenged me they have said god has no
[1:31:05] power here
[1:31:06] i'm going to show them that i have power
[1:31:08] anywhere they want to meet me
[1:31:10] and the victory again will be mine not
[1:31:12] yours but they stepped out without a
[1:31:14] promise
[1:31:15] they stepped out because they had obeyed
[1:31:17] the word of the lord and then the
[1:31:19] promise comes
[1:31:20] and says i'll give you the victory amen
[1:31:22] it's another emotion it's another time
[1:31:23] where they had to step out in faith
[1:31:25] put themselves in the array for battle
[1:31:27] and then god comes on the scene amen
[1:31:30] verse 29 and they pitched over against
[1:31:32] one another seven days
[1:31:34] and so it was in the seventh day the
[1:31:36] battle was joined and the children of
[1:31:37] israel slew of the syrians a hundred
[1:31:39] thousand footmen
[1:31:40] in that day hundred thousand men on the
[1:31:44] plains
[1:31:45] i guess he was god of the plains after
[1:31:46] all amen but the rest fled to apec
[1:31:49] into the city and there a wall fell upon
[1:31:52] 27
[1:31:52] 000 of the men that were left and ben
[1:31:55] had fled and came into the city into an
[1:31:57] inner chamber
[1:31:58] have you ever noticed with believers
[1:32:00] they get lucky
[1:32:05] a wall falls on 27 000 men
[1:32:09] that doesn't just happen amen
[1:32:12] when things are going on in your life
[1:32:14] and all of a sudden a way is made where
[1:32:16] there was no way
[1:32:18] this isn't luck this is the provision of
[1:32:20] god to fulfill
[1:32:22] his word in your life right that's when
[1:32:25] walls fall on 27
[1:32:26] 000 of your enemies he didn't leave that
[1:32:30] all to israel god knocked a wall over
[1:32:32] and killed 27
[1:32:33] i don't know how that happens i don't
[1:32:35] know how that happens
[1:32:36] but 27 000 men he finished the rest of
[1:32:39] them off and the only king only one
[1:32:40] that's left is the king
[1:32:41] he says he runs into the city and hides
[1:32:43] in an inner chamber
[1:32:45] it's the only one left is the king amen
[1:32:47] they wiped out a hundred thousand men
[1:32:49] god took care of the other twenty seven
[1:32:50] thousand men amen
[1:32:51] they obeyed god they stepped on the
[1:32:53] battlefield then god appeared on the
[1:32:55] battlefield
[1:32:55] and they wiped another army out 254
[1:32:59] 000 people died in ben hayden's army
[1:33:03] in a year that's a lot of losses to take
[1:33:06] it's just him left now it's just him
[1:33:08] left amen what brought them the victory
[1:33:11] obedience to god to strengthen
[1:33:13] themselves prepare for war
[1:33:15] amen and as long as we are here we have
[1:33:17] to prepare for war
[1:33:18] and then satan doesn't give up satan
[1:33:20] doesn't stop satan doesn't take a
[1:33:21] beating and then say that's enough i'm
[1:33:23] never going back there again
[1:33:24] he repairs he rebuilds and he comes back
[1:33:27] and he attacks again amen
[1:33:29] all they had to do was show up and start
[1:33:32] swinging
[1:33:33] their swords god took care of the rest
[1:33:35] we sing that song you know about david
[1:33:37] it says he flung the rock god did the
[1:33:38] rest that's all he's looking for you to
[1:33:40] do
[1:33:40] use your weapon amen use the word of the
[1:33:43] lord step out in faith
[1:33:44] step in behind the shield of faith and
[1:33:46] start swinging and you'll kill a hundred
[1:33:47] thousand
[1:33:48] demons and then they'll flee before you
[1:33:50] and then god will crush the restroom
[1:33:52] psalms 18 46 says the lord liveth and
[1:33:54] blessed be my rock
[1:33:56] and let the god of my salvation be
[1:33:58] exalted it is
[1:34:00] god that avengeth me and subdueth the
[1:34:02] people under me
[1:34:03] he delivereth me from mine enemies yea
[1:34:05] thou liftest me up above those that rise
[1:34:07] up against me
[1:34:08] thou hast delivered me from the violent
[1:34:10] man
[1:34:11] therefore will i give thanks unto thee o
[1:34:13] lord upon the heat among the heathen
[1:34:15] and sing praises unto thy name
[1:34:19] david recognized david had many great
[1:34:20] victories and he gave all of it
[1:34:23] back to god and said this is the working
[1:34:25] of the lord in my life
[1:34:26] he always showed up he always showed up
[1:34:29] and then he trusted the lord to bring
[1:34:31] the victory amen
[1:34:32] amen but you've got to be ready like i
[1:34:34] said the sword has to be sharp
[1:34:36] how are you going to use the word if you
[1:34:37] never read it right
[1:34:39] how are you going to have faith if you
[1:34:41] never build it up right right faith
[1:34:43] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:34:44] word we've gone through this amen
[1:34:46] how are you going to get fit if you're
[1:34:47] not testing right if you're not pushing
[1:34:49] yourself
[1:34:51] and you don't push yourself to go out
[1:34:53] and fight a demon what are you doing
[1:34:55] you're giving yourself endurance in the
[1:34:56] lord
[1:34:57] right to get yourself into the harness
[1:35:00] to put your shoulder to the wheel
[1:35:02] to press on the things that are still in
[1:35:04] your life amen you keep fit by
[1:35:06] practicing against what's available
[1:35:08] and then when that when when soldiers
[1:35:09] are practicing they've got the posts
[1:35:12] you know we use guns now so what do they
[1:35:14] do today they go out on the shooting
[1:35:15] range and they practice shooting don't
[1:35:16] they
[1:35:17] they do live fire exercises where they
[1:35:18] use real ammunition they have
[1:35:20] fake targets that they try and blow up
[1:35:22] but in those days you had you're
[1:35:23] fighting with swords and bows and arrows
[1:35:24] so what they do
[1:35:25] they go out there and they hack at posts
[1:35:26] in the in the ground
[1:35:28] to build up their strength for the sword
[1:35:30] and then they'd use
[1:35:31] fake swords or dulled swords against
[1:35:33] each other to build themselves up
[1:35:36] right they used whatever was around them
[1:35:38] they may not be fighting satan
[1:35:40] but they'll work on whatever they have
[1:35:41] and they chop down those trees with
[1:35:42] those swords
[1:35:43] just building them up amen and god has
[1:35:45] little things around us we we deal with
[1:35:47] things in our marriages and our children
[1:35:48] even within the church
[1:35:50] and you've got little situations and
[1:35:51] those are just there to build up your
[1:35:52] strength for the big battle
[1:35:54] amen if we're using big strength against
[1:35:56] each other we've got a problem
[1:35:58] right you weren't you didn't battle with
[1:36:00] another soldier to hurt them
[1:36:02] you battled to train you were there for
[1:36:04] their their benefit
[1:36:05] you weren't there to try and knock them
[1:36:07] down you were there to help build up
[1:36:08] their muscles and they were going to
[1:36:09] build up
[1:36:10] your muscles right you kind of provided
[1:36:12] a battering
[1:36:13] ram for each other you know somebody
[1:36:15] just hit on but it was with training
[1:36:16] swords you never were trying to hurt
[1:36:17] each other
[1:36:18] but you were encouraging each other you
[1:36:20] know do this do that i see a weakness
[1:36:22] here i see a weakness there
[1:36:24] you weren't battling each other you were
[1:36:25] building each other up you were helping
[1:36:26] train each other amen
[1:36:29] the crazy thing that happens here so ben
[1:36:31] hayden is the only one left
[1:36:33] we won't read it but he asks for mercy
[1:36:34] and ahab gives it to him
[1:36:37] ben haddad has come against them twice
[1:36:40] threatened to wipe them out
[1:36:41] he finally has him at his mercy and he
[1:36:44] says
[1:36:45] i'll let you go i'll let you go
[1:36:48] you've been tormenting israel for all
[1:36:50] these years and i'll let you go
[1:36:53] verse 42 just jump down there
[1:36:57] it says and he said unto him so the
[1:36:59] prophet comes to ahab he says
[1:37:01] thus saith the lord because thou has let
[1:37:04] go
[1:37:04] out of thy hand a man whom i appointed
[1:37:08] to utter destruction therefore thy life
[1:37:11] shall go for his life and thy people for
[1:37:13] his people
[1:37:14] and the king of israel went to his house
[1:37:16] heavy and displeased and came to samaria
[1:37:18] prophet said that man was appointed to
[1:37:20] destruction at your hand
[1:37:23] and you didn't do it i gave him into
[1:37:25] your hand
[1:37:26] i put your enemy in your power to kill
[1:37:29] him
[1:37:29] and you didn't do it you have mercy on
[1:37:31] him he actually calls him my brother
[1:37:35] that's how backsliding ahab was when he
[1:37:37] came to a place
[1:37:38] to actually have victory he said i'd
[1:37:40] rather have the brotherhood of an
[1:37:42] idolater as well
[1:37:43] than to take his life the prophet said
[1:37:47] here he says they're appointed for
[1:37:49] destruction it's the same thing for us
[1:37:51] there are things that are appointed for
[1:37:52] destruction in your life and he says
[1:37:54] when it's in your hand
[1:37:56] do not stop do not hold back
[1:37:59] do not let it go do not compromise do
[1:38:02] not back
[1:38:02] out you put it you put it down until it
[1:38:05] can't get up amen
[1:38:07] when god puts victory in your hands you
[1:38:08] don't show mercy and i'm not talking
[1:38:10] about people
[1:38:11] i'm talking about demons i'm talking
[1:38:13] about issues
[1:38:15] i'm not talking about killing people i'm
[1:38:16] talking about killing what they're
[1:38:18] bringing to the table amen
[1:38:19] what they're bringing against you we
[1:38:20] don't attack people we look for what's
[1:38:22] behind them the influence that's upon
[1:38:24] behind them amen satan's the accuser and
[1:38:27] the oppressor
[1:38:28] of the children of god he's not going to
[1:38:30] stop his only
[1:38:32] chance he has no chance but his only
[1:38:34] chance is to stop us
[1:38:36] and so it doesn't matter how badly we
[1:38:38] beat on him or any minion or demon that
[1:38:40] he throws at us
[1:38:41] he's going to come back the next day and
[1:38:43] the next day and the next day
[1:38:44] like i said brother braham said he said
[1:38:46] say good things
[1:38:47] one thing about satan he's a good enemy
[1:38:50] he keeps coming
[1:38:50] and coming and coming why they're wired
[1:38:52] to do it they are wired to attack us
[1:38:54] that's the only hope they have
[1:38:56] of not being cast into health and
[1:38:59] destroyed
[1:39:00] is if they can hold us back so he said
[1:39:02] you cannot play around with this this is
[1:39:04] not a time for mercy
[1:39:06] kill it do not compromise do not hold on
[1:39:08] to it
[1:39:09] do not say you can hang around
[1:39:10] occasionally
[1:39:12] put it out of your life completely amen
[1:39:14] look at this
[1:39:15] when david went up to goliath goliath
[1:39:17] was dead
[1:39:18] he knocked him down with the stone
[1:39:20] goliath was dead
[1:39:22] what did david do cut the head off and
[1:39:24] held it up
[1:39:26] right that's what we're looking to do
[1:39:28] you don't just leave it there
[1:39:30] cut the head off make sure that it is
[1:39:32] done and it'll never
[1:39:34] step up again amen there is total
[1:39:36] victory
[1:39:37] there's absolutely total victory for the
[1:39:39] believer satan's going to throw things
[1:39:41] at you and he'll never stop doing that
[1:39:42] your victory is not that satan will
[1:39:44] never throw things at you it's that he
[1:39:46] will never have influence in your life
[1:39:47] that he can't get you running to his
[1:39:49] tune as opposed to the purpose and plan
[1:39:51] of god amen
[1:39:53] turn to second kings 13 if you wouldn't
[1:39:55] we'll look at another example
[1:40:02] i want to drive in this idea that you
[1:40:05] never back down
[1:40:06] you never hold back you never take it
[1:40:08] easy you never compromise
[1:40:10] second kings 13 verse 14
[1:40:14] it says now elisha was fallen sick of
[1:40:16] his sickness wherever he died so he's
[1:40:18] he's dying here and joash the king of
[1:40:20] israel came down unto him josh was a
[1:40:22] good king
[1:40:23] and wept over his face and said oh my
[1:40:25] father my father the chariot of israel
[1:40:27] and the horsemen thereof
[1:40:28] now remember we just read where it said
[1:40:30] that israel didn't have the horses and
[1:40:31] chariots
[1:40:32] i love what he says here he says elisha
[1:40:34] was the horseman and chariots of israel
[1:40:37] he was the voice of god that kept them
[1:40:39] going and being and doing what they
[1:40:41] needed to do and be
[1:40:42] and where they had to be amen elisha the
[1:40:44] voice of god in their midst is what kept
[1:40:46] israel
[1:40:47] and he says you are the strength of
[1:40:48] israel you are the one that that allowed
[1:40:50] us to have these victories
[1:40:51] amen when god was speaking through and
[1:40:53] elijah said unto him take bow and arrows
[1:40:55] and he took unto him bow and arrows
[1:40:57] and he said to the king of israel put
[1:40:59] thine hand upon the bow
[1:41:00] and he put his hand upon it and elisha
[1:41:02] put his hands upon the king's hands
[1:41:05] and he said open the window eastward and
[1:41:07] he opened it and elisha said shoot
[1:41:09] and he shot and he said the arrow of the
[1:41:12] lord's deliverance
[1:41:13] and the arrow of deliverance from syria
[1:41:16] for thou shalt smite the syrians and
[1:41:17] aphid till thou hast consumed them
[1:41:20] now we just read where they came to
[1:41:22] aphec to fight do you remember that
[1:41:24] so first they came up to samaria then
[1:41:26] the second thing is they they came to
[1:41:27] aphec to fight
[1:41:28] and that's where they were defeated
[1:41:29] totally except for ben haydad was left
[1:41:31] alone
[1:41:32] right so this is people that are coming
[1:41:35] to fight in the place that god gave them
[1:41:36] their last great victory over syria
[1:41:39] he says there's an arrow of deliverance
[1:41:40] he says the lord has given you victory
[1:41:43] and then you'll have victory over them
[1:41:44] and this arrow is a representation of
[1:41:45] that the arrows are a representation of
[1:41:47] victory
[1:41:48] verse 18 he says take the arrows and he
[1:41:50] took them and he said unto the king of
[1:41:51] israel
[1:41:52] smite upon the ground and he smote
[1:41:54] thrice
[1:41:55] and stayed so what's he saying he's
[1:41:57] saying take victory in your hand and
[1:41:59] strike with it
[1:42:00] use it use that victory to drive that
[1:42:04] devil into the ocean where he can't come
[1:42:05] back him and
[1:42:06] put him down for good this is your way
[1:42:08] to defeat the syrians
[1:42:09] so strike with your victory and the king
[1:42:12] strikes the ground but he only strikes
[1:42:13] it three times
[1:42:15] he only struck three times right he
[1:42:18] doesn't guarantee victory with three
[1:42:20] because he knows they're going to keep
[1:42:21] coming back and back again the prophet's
[1:42:23] mad he says you should have kept going
[1:42:24] you should have struck until you knew
[1:42:26] that there was no way that they were
[1:42:27] going to be able to replenish their
[1:42:28] armies and come after you
[1:42:30] you should have kept going the man of
[1:42:31] god was wrath and said to him thou
[1:42:32] should have smitten five or six times
[1:42:35] then thou would have smitten syria till
[1:42:36] thou had consumed it resinal
[1:42:38] you'll only smite them three times but
[1:42:40] thrice says you're only going to get
[1:42:42] three victories over them and it's not
[1:42:43] going to be enough you should have kept
[1:42:44] hitting
[1:42:45] you should have kept throwing the arrows
[1:42:46] into the ground until you knew that that
[1:42:48] would be enough to destroy them amen
[1:42:50] what's he saying fight until there's no
[1:42:51] one left to fight right
[1:42:53] don't settle for we've brought them down
[1:42:55] to a thousand warriors left
[1:42:57] we've got more than them so that's
[1:42:59] enough he's saying no he should have
[1:43:00] went until you had utterly consumed them
[1:43:02] until you
[1:43:02] destroyed them completely amen
[1:43:06] you left a wounded enemy what's the most
[1:43:09] dangerous enemy in the in the animal
[1:43:10] kingdom the most dangerous is the
[1:43:12] wounded because they'll turn on you in a
[1:43:13] second
[1:43:14] they'll be laying there and you walk up
[1:43:15] to them you think they're dead and all
[1:43:16] of a sudden you're in there
[1:43:17] you're in their stomach you know because
[1:43:19] why they're just conserving their
[1:43:21] strength they draw you close and then
[1:43:22] they'll consume you themselves amen
[1:43:24] so you say how do i do that brother
[1:43:26] jonathan how do i destroy
[1:43:28] how do i destroy something in my life
[1:43:30] completely like i said you're never
[1:43:32] going to stop them from coming against
[1:43:33] you
[1:43:34] it's always going to come against you
[1:43:36] but one thing is is once you've defeated
[1:43:38] satan in an area and he tries again and
[1:43:39] he can't get in he tries again he can't
[1:43:41] get in
[1:43:41] he's going to switch tactics right
[1:43:44] because you'll see as you mature in
[1:43:45] christ that there's certain things you
[1:43:46] don't ever have to fight again
[1:43:48] you have thoroughly defeated them but
[1:43:50] what has happened is that as he's come
[1:43:52] up you've defeated him time and time
[1:43:53] again now you say how do i defeat him
[1:43:56] the first way you defeat him is you
[1:43:57] don't give him any attention in the
[1:43:58] first place
[1:43:59] right whatever you have been praying for
[1:44:02] whatever you have claimed whatever you
[1:44:04] have confessed whatever you're
[1:44:05] professing
[1:44:06] you don't acknowledge satan when he
[1:44:08] comes and tries to challenge it
[1:44:09] you don't have the conversation you
[1:44:11] don't open the door
[1:44:12] right you don't let him in the house you
[1:44:15] don't let him you know call you on your
[1:44:16] cell phone
[1:44:17] you don't acknowledge him and when you
[1:44:19] ignore him he can't do anything about it
[1:44:21] amen
[1:44:22] but the bible says this the faith that
[1:44:24] took away unbelief
[1:44:26] will resurrect it again amen
[1:44:29] when you take your stand for jesus
[1:44:31] christ stay there and die by it
[1:44:33] what god says is the truth and don't you
[1:44:36] fear satan hasn't got anything to do
[1:44:37] about it
[1:44:38] don't argue with them don't fuss with
[1:44:40] him just ignore him and walk away
[1:44:43] if you fuss with him he will keep you
[1:44:45] fussing
[1:44:46] night and day amen so let me stop there
[1:44:49] because i want you to catch that first
[1:44:50] line it says the faith
[1:44:52] that took away unbelief will resurrect
[1:44:54] it again
[1:44:55] why you have faith you're a believer you
[1:44:58] have faith and you can bring
[1:45:00] back what you have thrown out when you
[1:45:01] disbelieve because disbelief is a
[1:45:03] different kind of faith
[1:45:05] right it's a different kind of faith and
[1:45:07] it's a faith that allows things back
[1:45:09] into your life
[1:45:10] people that think bad things when i say
[1:45:12] bad things think
[1:45:13] unfortunate things and all this is going
[1:45:14] to happen and that's going to happen
[1:45:16] guess what it usually does
[1:45:17] because that's where their faith is and
[1:45:19] that's where their confession is so he
[1:45:20] says
[1:45:21] whatever it is that you used the faith
[1:45:23] that you used make sure you keep using
[1:45:25] it
[1:45:25] to keep the victory and don't allow it
[1:45:27] to slide over and start disbelieving
[1:45:29] because when it switches from faith to
[1:45:31] disbelief
[1:45:31] then all of a sudden it's going to start
[1:45:33] having a way to come back into you amen
[1:45:37] amen he says see well you'll say well
[1:45:40] you're not healed
[1:45:42] you'll say well now look satan i want to
[1:45:43] tell you something
[1:45:45] remember satan wants to have a
[1:45:46] conversation he says don't say it
[1:45:48] just say get away i don't want to hear
[1:45:50] nothing about you and walk on and say
[1:45:52] thank you lord go on see
[1:45:54] don't pay any attention to it he says
[1:45:56] remember when the unclean per
[1:45:57] spirit is gone out of a person it walks
[1:45:59] in dry places and returns back again
[1:46:01] with seven other spirits worse than it
[1:46:02] was
[1:46:03] and if it can it'll enter in and take
[1:46:05] over and the condition will be much
[1:46:06] worse
[1:46:07] but if the good man of the house isn't
[1:46:08] there which is your faith
[1:46:12] to keep it away he says don't fight at
[1:46:14] it it'll fight you back
[1:46:15] just refuse just ignore it that's all
[1:46:17] just go on just say it's over
[1:46:19] and that settles it for good amen don't
[1:46:22] dwell on the negative
[1:46:23] that's what he's saying because that's
[1:46:24] absolutely satan right the holy spirit
[1:46:26] is not negative to the word of god amen
[1:46:28] it is not negative to your confession
[1:46:30] brother braham is talking about mark 3
[1:46:32] 27 where he says no man can enter into a
[1:46:34] strong man's house and spoil his goods
[1:46:36] except he will first bind the strong man
[1:46:39] and then he will spoil his house
[1:46:41] and then we've heard in the last few
[1:46:42] services how the holy spirit will do
[1:46:44] what
[1:46:44] raise up a standard amen you're not
[1:46:47] the strong man or the strong woman in
[1:46:50] your life
[1:46:51] okay so if you think that binding the
[1:46:53] strong man or the strong woman in your
[1:46:54] life is binding you
[1:46:55] then you've already lost the battle
[1:46:57] brother brown says it is faith
[1:46:59] that is the strong man and that faith
[1:47:01] can only be through the power of the
[1:47:03] holy spirit in your life upon the
[1:47:04] revealed word of god for your life amen
[1:47:06] amen but through christ through the holy
[1:47:08] spirit we can do all things because what
[1:47:10] he
[1:47:10] strengthens us right and we're resting
[1:47:13] in the finished work of calvary
[1:47:14] we're resting in our justification we're
[1:47:16] resting in the stripes that he took
[1:47:17] at calvary we're resting in the shed
[1:47:19] blood amen
[1:47:21] amen you give preeminence to the
[1:47:23] faith-building habits to the
[1:47:24] faith-building people
[1:47:25] so that no doubt can enter in amen
[1:47:28] matthew 12 43 says when the unclean
[1:47:30] spirit has gone out of a man he walketh
[1:47:32] through dry places
[1:47:33] seeking rest and finding none so he says
[1:47:35] satan's put out sometimes brother brown
[1:47:37] said sometimes he doesn't
[1:47:38] he doesn't put out he just leaves he's
[1:47:41] go he goes looking seeing if there's
[1:47:42] maybe somebody he can use more
[1:47:44] effectively
[1:47:45] and then he comes back and sometimes
[1:47:46] he's kicked out and he tries to come
[1:47:48] back
[1:47:49] right so he says he walks around for a
[1:47:50] while verse 44 says then he say thou
[1:47:53] returned unto my house from once i came
[1:47:55] out and when he's come he findeth that
[1:47:56] empty
[1:47:57] swept and garnish so that demon that
[1:47:59] influence whatever it is it comes back
[1:48:01] and says hey
[1:48:02] i haven't found anybody so maybe i'll go
[1:48:04] try that that guy or that girl that i
[1:48:05] was with before
[1:48:07] see if i can influence them again see if
[1:48:08] i can get into their life he says and
[1:48:10] when he comes back he finds their life
[1:48:12] what
[1:48:12] empty swept and garnished so there's
[1:48:15] nothing there
[1:48:16] but it's super clean and it says garnish
[1:48:19] that means it's got little decorations
[1:48:21] in it
[1:48:22] just little things to make it look
[1:48:23] beautiful welcoming
[1:48:26] but there's nobody there it's waiting
[1:48:28] for something but there's nothing in it
[1:48:30] amen
[1:48:31] brother brahm says this he says now what
[1:48:32] just happened an evangelist comes
[1:48:34] through they preach repentance and you
[1:48:36] clean up from your sin
[1:48:38] and then when you're cleaned up the
[1:48:39] devil goes away from you you take your
[1:48:41] things back that you stole you go
[1:48:42] confess your wrongs to your wife or your
[1:48:44] husband
[1:48:44] you really clean up and then the thing
[1:48:47] of it is you're just clean and make a
[1:48:48] really good target for the devil
[1:48:51] i want to read that again he says and
[1:48:52] the thing of it is you're just clean
[1:48:54] and make a really good target for the
[1:48:58] devil
[1:49:00] place for him to come back because it's
[1:49:02] empty
[1:49:03] it's clean but it's empty i guess demons
[1:49:05] like clean things
[1:49:07] gives them lots of room to play around
[1:49:09] amen
[1:49:10] why what is it after a special meeting
[1:49:12] after a youth convention after special
[1:49:14] services what is it everybody's feeling
[1:49:16] all cleaned out
[1:49:18] right all fresh in the holy spirit and
[1:49:20] life is good and god is moving
[1:49:22] brian what do we do we go home we get
[1:49:24] rid of those things i remember after
[1:49:25] youth camps a lot of times back when cds
[1:49:27] were still a thing
[1:49:28] they'd have a cd burning fire at every
[1:49:30] youth camp where everybody brought the
[1:49:32] music they knew they shouldn't have been
[1:49:33] listening to and what they do they burn
[1:49:34] it
[1:49:36] right they cleaned out the their lives
[1:49:39] right they swept out everything they got
[1:49:41] out the dust and the cobwebs and the
[1:49:43] filth
[1:49:43] right lebron says that makes you a
[1:49:46] perfect target for the devil if that's
[1:49:48] all you do amen
[1:49:49] why because that's only a starting place
[1:49:51] you need to be sanctified you need to
[1:49:53] have a clean life
[1:49:54] but that's not enough brother branham he
[1:49:56] talks about it because it says the
[1:49:57] scripture says empty he says
[1:49:59] empty is idleness
[1:50:02] that's what's the matter with converts
[1:50:04] today as soon as you get converted you
[1:50:06] start idling around
[1:50:07] because why you have this wonderful
[1:50:09] feeling of cleanliness for the first
[1:50:11] time in your life
[1:50:12] because you've been baptized you've
[1:50:14] repented you've gotten all this weight
[1:50:16] off your shoulders like christian you
[1:50:17] know in the in pilgrim's progress
[1:50:18] he walks up to calvary and what happens
[1:50:21] is the great burden falls off of his
[1:50:22] back
[1:50:23] and all of a sudden he realizes what
[1:50:25] it's like to only feel his weight and
[1:50:27] not the weight of all of his sins
[1:50:29] right you're clean you're running around
[1:50:31] woo
[1:50:32] praise the lord praise the lord i'm
[1:50:34] saved i'm saved
[1:50:36] and all it is is you're clean you've
[1:50:39] lost the burden
[1:50:40] but that's not all there is he said you
[1:50:42] ought to be over there on your knees
[1:50:44] seeking god for the baptism of the holy
[1:50:46] ghost to be filled up
[1:50:48] you're empty but he says you've got to
[1:50:50] be filled up then
[1:50:52] you've got a wall his blessed presence
[1:50:55] with you
[1:50:56] and when the enemy comes in like the
[1:50:58] line in the den that night with daniel
[1:51:00] the light of god shines out and he gets
[1:51:01] away from you
[1:51:02] if the good man of the house hasn't got
[1:51:04] it garrisoned he says certainly
[1:51:08] what you've got to fill in what you've
[1:51:10] cleaned out you can't just take out the
[1:51:12] world and leave it empty
[1:51:13] otherwise that just makes a place for
[1:51:15] them to come back in again they've got a
[1:51:16] bunch of room to fill up
[1:51:17] and not only that because you cleaned it
[1:51:18] out they've got room for even more
[1:51:20] amen right yeah verse 45 says then go
[1:51:24] with he
[1:51:25] the demon and taketh with himself seven
[1:51:27] other spirits more wicked than himself
[1:51:29] and they enter in and dwell there
[1:51:30] and the last state of that man is worse
[1:51:32] than the first
[1:51:33] even so shall it be also unto this
[1:51:35] wicked generation
[1:51:37] worse you say brother jonathan you go to
[1:51:39] a camp you have a great service you go
[1:51:41] to special meetings you go to men's
[1:51:42] meetings and you can come back and in
[1:51:44] six months you're worse than when you
[1:51:45] went that's what it says
[1:51:47] if you don't have the holy spirit that's
[1:51:48] all it is is you're getting into a
[1:51:49] vicious cycle
[1:51:50] of clean dirty clean dirty clean dirty
[1:51:53] and the thing is you get dirtier the
[1:51:55] longer that cycle goes on
[1:51:56] until you break the cycle and say lord i
[1:51:59] need the holy spirit to fill up what's
[1:52:01] what's empty inside of me now amen he
[1:52:03] says god made you a place that could be
[1:52:05] emptied
[1:52:06] now you can't just polish the old life
[1:52:08] up
[1:52:09] because that's what you're doing is
[1:52:10] you're cleaning everything out and
[1:52:11] you're polishing it up you're making it
[1:52:13] look good but that's not the new life
[1:52:14] that's not the new birth that's just
[1:52:16] cleaning your life up that's just
[1:52:17] sanctification
[1:52:19] he says you can't give the old life a
[1:52:21] facelift
[1:52:22] i was right old wife you can't give the
[1:52:25] old life a facelift
[1:52:26] she's got to die in a new life be born
[1:52:28] in her she doesn't need some manicure or
[1:52:31] what it is you need
[1:52:32] or what it is you put on your lips that
[1:52:33] you women do you know to make them look
[1:52:35] better
[1:52:35] she doesn't need a hair curling she
[1:52:37] don't need the lip stuff the church
[1:52:39] needs a birth and a filling of the holy
[1:52:41] ghost
[1:52:42] amen the church needs a birth and a
[1:52:45] filling of the holy ghost
[1:52:46] you can attend church until you're blue
[1:52:48] in the face and if you don't walk out
[1:52:49] with the holy spirit doesn't matter how
[1:52:51] much
[1:52:51] he's present here if you don't walk out
[1:52:53] with them you're defeated already
[1:52:55] amen amen we don't come to church to get
[1:52:58] to to to experience the holy ghost he's
[1:53:00] got to be with us day in and day out and
[1:53:02] like i said when you leave a service
[1:53:04] and you you've accepted something from
[1:53:06] god he's got to be there with you when
[1:53:07] you go home and it's just you and the
[1:53:08] four walls amen
[1:53:10] you've got to have something that's
[1:53:11] filled the empty place in your life
[1:53:14] and it's constantly filling and
[1:53:15] refilling and expanding and pushing out
[1:53:17] and pushing out amen
[1:53:19] amen we don't come to church to find god
[1:53:21] he has to be an experience that we have
[1:53:23] every minute every hour every day
[1:53:25] every week every month what is it 365
[1:53:28] days a year
[1:53:29] every year that is the experience of the
[1:53:31] holy ghost and the true believer amen
[1:53:33] and it's got to be there whether
[1:53:34] anybody's looking whether mom and dad
[1:53:36] are looking over your shoulder whether
[1:53:38] your spouse is looking over your
[1:53:39] shoulder whether the pastor's there
[1:53:40] whatever it is
[1:53:41] you've got to have him there regardless
[1:53:43] of what he what anybody's doing i saw at
[1:53:44] the baptist church
[1:53:46] yesterday at the school it said
[1:53:47] character is what you do when nobody's
[1:53:48] looking
[1:53:49] amen amen the holy ghost will give you
[1:53:51] character to live the life regardless of
[1:53:53] anybody looking over your shoulder
[1:53:54] you know and then when you got the holy
[1:53:57] ghost
[1:53:58] now you've got the garnishment see the
[1:54:00] thing is they're making it pretty for
[1:54:01] something but they don't have that thing
[1:54:03] in there
[1:54:03] get the thing in there and then you can
[1:54:05] suit the garnishing to the taste of
[1:54:07] whatever's in there
[1:54:08] amen remember brother brown said you
[1:54:09] know you've got a uh
[1:54:11] he talked about smoking man's filter and
[1:54:12] and these different things he said
[1:54:14] you've got a holy man's taste and it's
[1:54:15] what
[1:54:16] the holy spirit pulling things through
[1:54:17] the filter of the word so now you start
[1:54:19] to garnish your life you start to add in
[1:54:20] these little things to enhance what
[1:54:23] the holy spirit's effect in your life
[1:54:25] things that would please god in your
[1:54:26] life
[1:54:27] right not just taking out but now you've
[1:54:29] got to add according to his taste
[1:54:30] according to his preference
[1:54:32] according to his will and according to
[1:54:33] what he likes amen
[1:54:35] because why you've got to be able to
[1:54:36] handle the rigors the rigors of a
[1:54:38] christian walk
[1:54:39] without somebody next to you backing you
[1:54:41] up every time
[1:54:42] amen i love david because of that he
[1:54:44] didn't look for backup
[1:54:46] he ran towards the enemy he says i can
[1:54:49] take care of this
[1:54:50] myself right god's with me i'll take
[1:54:52] care of it and it's the same thing for
[1:54:53] believers we're here to help each other
[1:54:55] but sometimes like sister barnes you
[1:54:57] don't have somebody there
[1:54:59] you can't call the pastor your spouse
[1:55:00] isn't there and you're going to have to
[1:55:02] deal with satan one-on-one and you've
[1:55:03] got to be able to say
[1:55:04] the holy spirit is in me and that gives
[1:55:06] me full and complete authority
[1:55:08] and power to boot him out of my life
[1:55:10] every single
[1:55:11] time amen let's turn to first samuel 30
[1:55:15] as we start to close
[1:55:16] one more example
[1:55:25] first samuel 30 and we'll read it verse
[1:55:30] one
[1:55:36] for samuel 30 verse 1 says and it came
[1:55:38] to pass when david and his men were come
[1:55:39] to ziklag on the third day
[1:55:41] that the amalekites had invaded the
[1:55:43] south and ziklag and smitten zig leg and
[1:55:45] burned it with fire
[1:55:47] so this is where david had lived in the
[1:55:49] in the land of philistia right
[1:55:50] he had his own city given to him his men
[1:55:53] and their wives and children and whatnot
[1:55:55] and they had taken the women captives
[1:55:57] that were therein they slew not any
[1:55:59] either great or small but carried them
[1:56:00] away and went on their way so the
[1:56:02] amalekites come in they take everything
[1:56:04] they don't kill anything they're not
[1:56:05] there to kill they're there to take away
[1:56:09] so david and his men came to the city
[1:56:10] and behold it was burned with fire and
[1:56:12] their wives and their sons and their
[1:56:13] daughters were taken captives
[1:56:15] then david and the people that were with
[1:56:16] him lifted up their voice and wept
[1:56:18] until they had no more power to weep
[1:56:21] there's going to be things in life where
[1:56:23] you're going to be sad
[1:56:25] you're going to be sorrowful genuinely
[1:56:26] sorrowful right
[1:56:28] there's no there's no guarantee of an
[1:56:30] easy walk for the believer
[1:56:34] and david's two wives were taking
[1:56:35] captives ahem the jezreelitis and
[1:56:37] abigail the wife of nabel the carmelite
[1:56:39] amen
[1:56:40] this is about the worst scenario you
[1:56:41] could think of as a leader okay
[1:56:43] you're in a land where you're not
[1:56:44] supposed to be he's in philistia he's
[1:56:45] not supposed to be friends with the
[1:56:47] philistines
[1:56:48] so he's in the place he's out of the
[1:56:49] will of god here he's not supposed to be
[1:56:51] here
[1:56:51] he comes back and he and everything he
[1:56:55] owns is burned or stolen away
[1:56:57] so he's lost his family he's lost his
[1:56:58] children and so have his men and he has
[1:57:00] nothing left to come back to
[1:57:02] everything's taken away and everybody's
[1:57:04] weeping
[1:57:05] everybody's crying everybody's mad this
[1:57:09] is not a good day in david's life amen
[1:57:12] but i want you to catch the thing as we
[1:57:13] start to read through this is that david
[1:57:14] knows
[1:57:15] he's still the anointed king amen even
[1:57:18] out of the will of god he's still the
[1:57:20] anointed king
[1:57:21] and so david isn't sitting here and
[1:57:23] saying oh no oh no oh no what are we
[1:57:25] going to do
[1:57:26] david has a place to go to amen and even
[1:57:28] in this backslidden condition and that's
[1:57:30] what it is
[1:57:31] he was backslidden he was out of the
[1:57:32] land of israel right god took care of
[1:57:34] him in israel he came to the philistines
[1:57:36] because he wanted a break from the
[1:57:38] battles he wanted a break from saul
[1:57:40] chasing him down all the time he wanted
[1:57:41] to get away from having to look over his
[1:57:43] shoulder every day
[1:57:44] and wonder where's the trap set today
[1:57:45] where's the trap set today where's the
[1:57:47] trap set today
[1:57:48] and he got away from knowing that god
[1:57:49] was his strength he didn't
[1:57:51] he didn't want to trust god anymore he
[1:57:53] wanted to just get out from under the
[1:57:54] battle and sometimes that's it isn't it
[1:57:56] sometimes what you're doing is you'll
[1:57:57] give in a little bit to satan on
[1:57:59] something
[1:58:00] just to keep them from pushing you
[1:58:02] harder
[1:58:04] right sometimes you'll look at something
[1:58:06] you'll watch something you'll see
[1:58:07] something you'll do something
[1:58:09] because that's what he's asking you to
[1:58:10] do but you know that if you do it then
[1:58:12] he'll give you a break
[1:58:13] that's a scary place to be but
[1:58:16] you may not realize it now go home and
[1:58:18] think about it and say when is the last
[1:58:19] time i've done something i really
[1:58:20] shouldn't have
[1:58:21] and why did i really do it and what
[1:58:22] you'll find is you'll say i wanted a
[1:58:24] break
[1:58:26] i wanted a break and what it is is satan
[1:58:28] has been fighting you and fighting you
[1:58:29] and you give in and say i don't want to
[1:58:31] fight anymore so i'll do a little bit of
[1:58:33] what he wants me to do
[1:58:34] and he'll let me go for a little bit but
[1:58:37] the thing is that's just one step
[1:58:39] and then the next day he'll do the next
[1:58:41] and now you get a trend and you get a
[1:58:42] pattern all of a sudden you've got an
[1:58:43] addiction you've got a habit
[1:58:44] you've got wrong friends you're going
[1:58:46] into the wrong situations and all the
[1:58:48] same
[1:58:48] pro all of a sudden satan has a foothold
[1:58:50] in your life
[1:58:52] right because why you're trying to get a
[1:58:53] break from the battle and that's what
[1:58:54] david was doing here amen
[1:58:58] verse six says and david was greatly
[1:59:00] distressed for the people spake of
[1:59:02] stoning him because the soul of all the
[1:59:03] people was grieved every man for his
[1:59:05] sons and first daughters
[1:59:08] david has 400 men that follow him around
[1:59:10] and they'll do anything for him remember
[1:59:12] they fought all the way to bethlehem to
[1:59:13] get him
[1:59:14] a a drink of water okay that's how much
[1:59:17] they love david they left their families
[1:59:19] or you know they they were not left
[1:59:20] their families because obviously they
[1:59:21] had them but they left everything they
[1:59:23] had follow him they were outcasts with
[1:59:24] david
[1:59:25] they loved david and they respected him
[1:59:27] and they believed he was going to be the
[1:59:28] king
[1:59:29] but at this point they turn on him and
[1:59:31] they're ready to kill him that's how mad
[1:59:32] they are
[1:59:33] right
[1:59:36] it says but david encouraged himself and
[1:59:40] the lord is god
[1:59:41] the amplified says david encouraged and
[1:59:43] strengthened himself
[1:59:44] and the lord is god why like i said
[1:59:47] david even his backs and conditions
[1:59:48] knows he's still the anointed choice of
[1:59:50] god for the kingdom
[1:59:52] and he knows that if he goes to god god
[1:59:54] will still direct him
[1:59:55] god will still give him leadership and
[1:59:57] god will still allow him to see what he
[1:59:59] has to do in this situation
[2:00:00] and god will make a way now there's no
[2:00:02] guarantee that david gets his family
[2:00:03] back
[2:00:04] there's no there's no guarantee that the
[2:00:06] rest of his men get their men back
[2:00:08] their families back but david encourages
[2:00:11] himself because he says god has never
[2:00:13] left me in a
[2:00:14] in a condition that i can't get out of
[2:00:15] it not get out of it himself but that
[2:00:17] god has made a way that god has put a
[2:00:19] door in a wall where there is no door
[2:00:21] right that god is called away solved
[2:00:23] just as he's about to capture him these
[2:00:24] different things
[2:00:25] david has never been pinned down to
[2:00:27] where he can't get away and so david
[2:00:29] encourages himself because he has a
[2:00:30] personal experience
[2:00:32] with a god that delivers amen that god
[2:00:34] that leads
[2:00:35] a god that provides all of these things
[2:00:38] david has a personal experience and so
[2:00:39] he's encouraging himself and he's
[2:00:40] remembering
[2:00:41] okay this is what he did and he's not
[2:00:43] just going back to the line and the bear
[2:00:45] and goliath
[2:00:46] he's going back to what's happened so
[2:00:47] recently with saul in these different
[2:00:48] situations right
[2:00:50] even to where he didn't have to fight i
[2:00:51] mean god literally just saved him from
[2:00:53] having to fight against israel
[2:00:54] he went up with the philistines and the
[2:00:56] philistines said to the king they said
[2:00:58] don't let david he used to be their
[2:00:59] champion what are you doing putting them
[2:01:01] in our army
[2:01:01] we'll be fighting and then he'll turn on
[2:01:03] us and then we'll lose the battle
[2:01:04] so god had saved israel for or david
[2:01:07] from fighting against israel just three
[2:01:08] days ago
[2:01:11] and so david encourages himself and he
[2:01:12] says god's still with me
[2:01:14] i just need to find him amen
[2:01:18] he doesn't turn to himself but he knows
[2:01:20] where the answer lies because we see it
[2:01:22] in verse seven it says and david said to
[2:01:23] abiathar the priest the himalayan son
[2:01:25] i pray thee bring me hither the ephod
[2:01:28] and abyatha brought it to david
[2:01:30] and david inquired at the lord saying
[2:01:32] shall i pursue after this troop
[2:01:34] shall i overtake them and he answered
[2:01:36] pursue
[2:01:37] for thou shalt surely overtake them and
[2:01:39] without fail
[2:01:40] recover all amen pursue them david
[2:01:44] not only that but you won't lose a
[2:01:45] single one i'm going to give you victory
[2:01:47] over them even in your backslidden
[2:01:49] condition
[2:01:50] i'm going to give you victory and then
[2:01:52] we're going to bring you out because
[2:01:53] saul will be dead and i'm going to
[2:01:54] restore you into the kingdom
[2:01:55] amen david's position as an anointed
[2:01:58] son of god gave him access to god every
[2:02:02] time
[2:02:04] it doesn't matter where you're at we
[2:02:05] claim the blood but we don't claim the
[2:02:07] blood to say okay lord i did this and
[2:02:09] i'm claiming the blood now now i need
[2:02:10] this
[2:02:11] no no there's a repentance that comes
[2:02:12] with that amen
[2:02:14] but you don't have to sit there and beat
[2:02:15] yourself up over it right
[2:02:17] and so david says lord i'm looking for
[2:02:20] an answer
[2:02:21] and god says here's your answer pursue
[2:02:23] and without fail you will recover
[2:02:25] all what a place to be amen
[2:02:29] every single one of them is going to
[2:02:30] come back you're going to get back
[2:02:32] everything you lost and then we're going
[2:02:34] to bring you into the kingdom and you'll
[2:02:35] be king over there amen
[2:02:36] well you say hold nothing back push hard
[2:02:40] pursue them don't let the victory slide
[2:02:44] away
[2:02:45] it looks bad looks real bad they ran
[2:02:47] them down
[2:02:48] they ran so hard to get after them that
[2:02:50] david couldn't take the whole group with
[2:02:51] them some of them fell behind did you
[2:02:53] know that
[2:02:54] they pursued so hard that they caught up
[2:02:56] they made up three days in
[2:02:58] in a very short period of time why they
[2:03:00] knew that they had the victory
[2:03:02] and yet some of them still fell by the
[2:03:03] wayside and they had to keep going on
[2:03:05] and david actually took him without
[2:03:07] having all of his men with them
[2:03:08] he had to amen like i've said before
[2:03:12] we want our lives to be a personal hell
[2:03:15] for satan
[2:03:16] amen we want satan to be asking who was
[2:03:19] driving the truck that just ran me over
[2:03:22] because i had them down i had them
[2:03:24] pinned
[2:03:25] i had them in a position where they
[2:03:27] couldn't move
[2:03:28] and all of a sudden the match is over
[2:03:30] and their hands raised in victory
[2:03:32] and i'm laying there wondering what hit
[2:03:34] me why
[2:03:35] because it's not based on how it looks
[2:03:37] it's not based on numbers it's not based
[2:03:39] on strength
[2:03:40] it's based on who you are amen amen and
[2:03:43] on the basis of the promise of god for
[2:03:45] you
[2:03:45] he's going to give you that victory amen
[2:03:47] but he's saying prepare
[2:03:49] for battle go strengthen thyself joshua
[2:03:52] 1 9 as the musicians come
[2:03:54] says have i not commanded thee be strong
[2:03:57] and of a good courage be not afraid
[2:04:00] neither be thou dismayed
[2:04:01] for the lord thy god is with thee wither
[2:04:04] so ever
[2:04:05] thou goest when you're walking in the
[2:04:08] land that he has given you he says be of

[2:04:12] be strong don't be afraid don't be
[2:04:13] dismayed for the lord god is with thee

[2:04:27] good things of god

[2:04:30] ghost and then build a fortification
[2:04:33] around that
[2:04:34] and then build a fortification about the
[2:04:35] infilling of god in your life
[2:04:37] and let it start pushing out everything
[2:04:39] that he's that satan's brought against
