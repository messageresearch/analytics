glory and i shall be made amen lord bless us amen we'll try to get into oh sorry brother we'll try to get into it as soon as we can the word and so we'll leave time to for the business part of it amen because we want to give it preeminence to the word give preemies to our brother bob leave some more songs and then we'll turn to the the business part amen i think it's brother paul amen he's not a politician amen thank the lord for that and uh but i but still i think their believers get caught up in politics but i don't and again as i said before let me repeat it that uh there was a time when a politician did come knock on my door and wanted to know if i voted i said no i said i've never voted he said why i said well i said what's his name the the the cartoon rabbit bugs bunny i said bugs bunny is not running so so i said i i don't vote always said i see that was it and he moved on he wasn't he wasn't bugs bunny amen so thank the lord and again i don't know if brother brown ever ever voted in an election and uh i'm not sure now i've heard it before that it might if he did it might have been just once but he never bothered after that amen because boy we want we want to elect jesus amen it's not this gentleman that gentleman this woman that won't elect jesus and that's all now more and more part of the world when it comes to politics it's not like it used to be no no not not by any means why because one time when we were younger the even politicians were saying but now they're insane oh yeah it's all getting to that place insanity and they're governed we're governed by a lot of thoughts but it's not normal thoughts anymore so god help us to stay with with the net with the normal amen revelation of the word the revelation of god to us amen and i want to bring you greetings uh from our brother and sister eugene young and i think you're leaving beachside i think and our brother eugene called on the phone last evening and just to discuss some things that he wanted some thoughts on it some feelings on it i guess from me as a pastor and also we want to if he's there online that we want to welcome our brother eugene and his wife amen and he said that we're we're tuned in he said we're listening to you on on youtube and uh oh i said okay i said you know you know by that yes he said i know about it and so we said we appreciate the word and uh and he's and praise the lord he's looking forward to brother jonathan ministering again and i said well that's good i said he'll be ministering this wednesday amen so be in prayer for brother gerald because uh our brother um ellsworth you'll be arriving here i i assume might be on tuesday because he's got two appointments on wednesday early in the morning late in the afternoon two different hospitals and so on so we're so the lord willing the brother johnson will be ministering for me on wednesday ministering to the saints again so god bless our brother we'll be in prayer for you and of course our brother ellsworth uh i think he's due to have the voice box surgery whatever and on thursday and uh so he's got quite a quite a task ahead of him so i'll be i'll be working with him and taking him to the two of the two hospitals and being there when he's when he's having surgery and so on so be in prayer for our brother ellsworth and the issues that we'll be dealing with then so i may not be here on a wednesday night but brother jonathan will be here amen and also uh we want to thank the lord for uh some of the saints who in africa are also watching us on youtube amen we received an email from a brother jacob jonah and we've been in contact with him for a number of years and he's in ghana and uh and he did advise us that even brother jacob also tunes in to hear us online on youtube i said well that's tremendous it's amazing so it's all around the world amen the messages around the world the gospel of christ is around the world and so on so we're at the we're at the truly we are at the end of all things as i said if god invented the tape recorders to tape the messages so god allowed the internet to come to get the gospel around the world amen it's absolutely amazing so god's grace to us as we move on but look up we're moving on to the resurrection moving on to the rapture we're moving on to get out of here amen because if you got if you're saying you this is the most uncomfortable place for you amen if you've got sanity nothing normally anymore i thought about it and i said lord this is not the world we lived in even a few years ago and most definitely not the world we lived in when i was maybe in my 20s even first coming to this word coming to this message oh my i said lord i said we need your help amen by the grace of god to move on with with him it's finished why why would we call him for that because he said when he comes will he find faith on the earth amen that's that's how bad it's going to be spiritually there's going to be so little little faith so god have mercy on us brother says let's make make our calling election sure by the grace of god lord trust me by grace that we're going to be numbered with those that are going in the resurrection that are going in the rapture amen so brother this is the this is the only way out of this world and into what god has promised in his word amen and there's no doubt this is why he he predestinated it and he forned the ministry of a prophet in the last days amen that he would minister through that the same ministry the same message that he had when he was here on the earth 2000 years ago it's absolutely amazing so we thank god for it and i pray lord help us to believe amen that we're not going to run away but we're going to stay with the word by the grace of god amen so that that's how serious it is and it's getting more and more serious when we consider the fact that even so-called message believers are getting less and less and less spiritual amen and that spirit of the world the spirit of a church just that religious spirits amen not the holy ghost no definitely not so we pray the grace of god that we're going to stay under the anointing of the holy ghost we're not going to move away to a religious spirit amen and and the religious spirit will focus on what is religious spirit focusing on is focusing on doctrines and certain theology but the spiritual anointing in the bride is focusing on the resurrection and the rapture it's focusing on what god has promised for this age amen by the grace of god so help us to keep focusing on the resurrection help us to keep focusing on the rapture by the grace of god you want to go that's the only way out of here now is resurrection and rapture so i pray grace to us amen that we're going to believe the word we're going to keep moving into the message and we're what are we looking for brother it's not just this idea on this doctrine of that doctrine no what we're looking for is more and more and more rapturing faith amen so that god's going to increase our faith and brother we need it by the grace of god so brother one thing to believe for this believe for that but brother are we believing for the rapture are we hungry and thirsting for the rapture to get out of here that's the only way out by the grace of god amen so god be with us as we press on into the word to line up with the word face the challenge of the word amen so we're not just religious believing doctrines no no we're spiritual amen acknowledging that it is god working on me working on you to get us separated for and ready for the rapture amen that's what he's doing so god help us so the lord bless us let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible yes only believe but believe in your heart amen hallelujah only baby all things are possible only believe jesus is here yes he's here amen let's be conscious of him amen he is the resurrection he is the rapture amen praise the name of the lord jesus is here amen he's with us he's in us amen hallelujah praise the lord amen jesus is here all things are possible jesus [Applause] lord i be amen amen hallelujah believe all things are possible lord i believe lord amen amen amen praise the lord hallelujah things are possible lord i be amen yes lord and again we ask your grace to help us to believe with a complete belief amen where there are no questions there are no doubt we believe the word amen we believe the revealed word and we believe lord that it's ordained to give us the faith that pleases you in this hour that pleases you lord in this day in this age amen father knowing that we are looking up and we need the faith for the resurrection we need the faith for the rapture so we pray lord that you keep working on your servants keep working on the sons and daughters of god okay working on the bride of christ amen father increasing our faith increasing our faith father for the change of this old body amen increasing our faith and believing with all of our hearts amen that we are in the end of all things hallelujah father we know that the only way out is a resurrection and a rapture so lord help us to believe that what you have done you have done and you are doing amen to make it more and more real to us amen that is not just a thought it's just not a theory it's just not a doctrine father not a part of a creed amen but it's had the absolute reality of the prophecy of the revealed word amen elvis to believe hallelujah with that complete belief i pray grace said there be no doubt no questions father amen but we believe it and we are expecting the change amen lord in our lives will reflect what we believe our lives will reflect what we're looking for our lives will reflect lord amen what we are expecting amen not focusing on the world not focusing on the things of the world amen but focusing on the things of god by the grace of god father knowing what you have done knowing what you're doing and knowing what you will do help us to believe it amen so there we're going to be there father that you can use us amen you can reveal it in us you can make it flesh in us amen the change onto a glorified body so we committed all into your care soul body and spirit and grace that we're going to stay with the word that is ordained and predestinated to give us the faith that pleases you amen to give us the faith we need in this hour amen father moving on yes lord believing what luther preached and believing what wesley preached for the pentecostals father hallelujah but we're so glad there was a crowning of the word for the bride amen and lord believing that's why we're here today amen that's why we're pressing on today that's why we believe what we believe today amen it's predestinated a day amen for the resurrection it's for a day for the rapture help us to believe lord for this as they believe for the message lord you gave them amen show grace to us as we go into your word grace to us to give us greater and greater understanding of your word and a greater revelation of what you're doing amen it's good lord we thank you for what you did and we thank you for what you're going to do but we're so glad father for the revelation of what you're doing so be with us lord that we'll go forth more and more and more surrendered to what you're doing be with us we pray for your glory your honor and your praise and for the building up of the body in the most holy faith grace grace grace in the name of our lord grace in the name of our savior jesus christ amen and amen and amen amen praise the lord hallelujah now i believe now i believe [Music] all things are possible now amen now yes now now amen praise the lord hallelujah [Music] yes praise the lord amen thank you jesus now i believe amen praise the lord amen praise the lord god bless you turn with me to first corinthians chapter 2. that some of these scriptures that we have read but do worth reading again amen in first corinthians chapter 2 and beginning to read at verse 9 amen but as it is written the eye hath not seen nor the ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but thank god for the holy ghost anointing that does reveal to us amen thank you for god for the new birth so that he reveals it to us in our soul amen it says again neither entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him amen but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god amen for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god see we know we absolutely need and recognize our need for their indwelling presence of god in the holy ghost amen verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god amen so we need the spirit to reveal to us now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god amen praise the lord so brother it's not just believing say well jesus did this jesus did that thank the lord and move on but they're ignoring the presence tense revelation of jesus what's jesus doing he did it what's he doing now amen we need to the revelation of the present tense and so we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god amen which sings also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth by which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen not religion not a religious spirit but the holy ghost amen let's compare spiritual things with spiritual things and to do that we have to stay with the word but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him and neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned amen and that's why we're here in such a small group amen because it's going to get smaller and smaller and smaller yeah maybe the lord has stayed a little longer until the older ones here be gone on amen so we pray the grace of god and we pray the grace of god amen to our young brothers and sisters here that you're going to stay with the word amen that you're going to see it the reality of it in your mother in your father in your grandparents amen that you know that it's not just religion no no it's the living god living in us amen fulfilling his word verse 13 which sings also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him and neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned amen showing the the need to be spiritual and not religious amen but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him amen but we have the mind of christ god bless his word you may be seated and let's go on to chapter 3. and read it again verses one two six amen let's pay attention to what the what the word is saying concerning being spiritual amen and it's spiritual people that god uses it's the spiritual sons and daughters of god that god is is revealing his word to amen we if there's brothers anything that we need to make sure that we have and that it's a spiritual relationship with god amen brother grace so that we're not just here all because of religion because of a doctrine this doctrine this doctrine no it's an experience it's our relationship with the lord and in our experience in our relationship with the lord he is there to reveal his word amen what for he is there to reveal what he will give us the faith that pleases him in the hour that we're living amen again that's praise the lord for the revelation that's why that luther you know he had the faith what pleased god in that hour and that age why because he was ongoing and thirsting for it amen and god revealed it to him the same for wesley the same for many other groups and the same for the pentecostals they were angry and thirsting and amen why god brother brown said he said god he said always sends the holy ghost ahead he said to create in our hearts a hundred of thirsts for what he's going to do amen so that brings god on the scene amen to do what just to do this just to do that no it's going to be according to the word amen so we know that god came on the scene and luther and that was god what was he doing doing what he's promised to do i will restore said the lord amen so they had a revelation of that of that restoration in the days of luther in the days of wesley in the days of the old salvation army and in the days of pentecost amen hungry and thirsting for the word amen well that's good but what's that word going to do god through the word is going to give us faith amen and there's going to be the faith for that hour for that age that you need so brother sister again thank god for the faith that luther had and even the pentecostal said but i tell them we're going to need a greater faith than that now amen most definitely because what they experienced god given the victory over it and they moved on but brother what you and i are experiencing amen in this hour in this age that it is so bad that jesus said when he comes will he find faith amen because amen because most are caught up maybe into religion but again that's not what god's looking for he's looking for faith in the revealed word amen and it's the faith that's going to bring the past the word ordain and predestinate it for the hour that we're living amen and brother again thank god for what he did in previous ages what he did through previous messengers but brother thank god for what he's doing now amen because what we need now is to get out of here amen those brothers and sisters were there and they were living living for god and and they did their lives reflected god reflected the word that was ordained then amen but as i said oh my god requires more of us now than he did of them amen we know that they did this and they did that amen but in this hour god's requiring more amen and what what is it he is bringing a greater and a greater separation amen from the world and a greater separation from the things of the world than previous ages than previous messages amen for god has ordained in this hour and in this message amen to bring us to a complete absolute separation unto the lord amen so we are totally separated unto him and we are totally given over to the to the word of god for this hour we're looking for a man not what well the others look for it after after they left the scene after they went off the earth but now there's a generation rising on the earth that god is giving them a revelation to look for the resurrection god has given us a revelation to believe for the rapture do we really really believe that there that the resurrection is on amen do we really believe the rapture is on the prophet said he said the rapture is going on all the time amen praise the lord what do you mean it's going on all the time because god is revealing his word and we're maturing in the word all the time amen and the climax of it is going to be the rapture the climax of it is going to be the change of our bodies brother how spiritual will that will that elect me our spiritual where those sons and daughters of god be amen so that you're totally separated from from everything else and you're totally separated onto this it's not god did this and he's going to do this no brother we've come to the end of the gentile dispensation amen and he's making an end of all that he has predestinated and for ordained for the gentiles amen now it's finished there was an hour when he turned from the jews back 2 000 years ago and he turned to the gentiles but now he's moving from the gentiles back to the jews amen but he's given us the faith that's going to take us off the scene he's giving us the faith going to take us off the earth amen and it's going to it's going to allow this to happen that to heaven amen and it's going to amen i tell you it's going on even now in israel i've explained it before let me explain it again that there are a couple of young jews in israel they've been beyond the curtain of time they have oh yes they've had that experience amen and there was a time that long ago when when they they got together with a lot of rabbis in jerusalem amen and the rabbis wanted to meet them the rabbis wanted to talk to them they wanted to know what did you see amen was there a message what's going on amen and and one of the young men just stood there and he said this is what i saw this is what i heard amen they praise the lord and oh what an experience that he had but i tell you why why is that it's god amen it's a testimony amen and a warning to us that he's finishing with the gentiles and he's moving back to the jews amen oh yeah god god concerning moving from jews to israel or to the gentiles somebody has said something in the word of god lord do this do this but don't do that and jesus brother brown said he said god had to do it he said to get is he his gentile seed amen those are me for knew he said god allowed this to happen amen where the gentiles were moved to move but moved away amen god turned away from the jews not the gentiles and moving to the gentiles now he's turned away from the gentiles moved back to the jews amen thank god that we know what god is doing amen that we know what is prophesied in the word he said i'm going to do this i'm going to do that and brother we get on into the book of revelation and he's going back to the jews brother it's a it's about over for the jew for the gentiles amen so listen and this is why that we got to make our calling and our election sure amen because there comes an hour when the last one of the gentiles comes in amen and again that last one might be in it might be among the young people here today and we pray the grace of god that they're going to follow the examples that the older ones are setting make your calling and your election sure amen but don't just assume i'm in the message don't just deserve because i'm in the message i'm going to go in the resurrection i'm going to go in the rapture no no no brother that i'm going to no if you're really in the message you're in the revelation of the resurrection if you're reading the message you're really in the revelation of the rapture amen you're caught up by the grace of god with what god is doing amen amen amen and again as i said we've been resurrected we've experienced it it's coming again we've been raptured we've experienced it and it's coming again why because in that rapture we're in heavenly places in christ and what's christ doing thank god for what what he explained to us in the ministry of william branham he said amen in those heavenly places in christ he said christ is revealing his word amen what for to give us the resurrection yes and the rapture to give us the faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture brother grace as luther got caught up with justification and their other sanctification then the pentecostals they were cut up with the gifts of the spirit amen the baptism of the holy ghost amen and brother the bride is getting caught up but with what that plus amen because it's now revealed to us this is the hour of the resurrection this is the hour of the rapture and brother we've got to get raptured into that and that will rapture us into glory amen let's get caught up in the revealed word for this hour amen that's focusing on the resurrection focusing on the rapture amen it's just not focusing what what what is the church is focusing on now what are what are the preachers focusing on amen or they're focusing on what god did and what god oh god wants you to come and do this god wants you to come and accept jesus yeah brother i tell you this it's more than just making you a church goer amen praise the lord it's getting us to look beyond the church and look up amen others are just looking to the church they're looking in the church looking down at this looking down at that but the bride is looking up amen because what god has done and what god is doing is predestinated to get us to look up anything that god is looking for in your life and in my life anything god is looking for in your heart and your soul amen is look up yeah you're looking up you're not looking back oh yes lord give us more what they had give us that knowing give it to us all that we need amen but go on to what we need now and brother i don't know there's not i don't i don't think there's many want to get out of here they're just moving on and believing the message oh this is wonderful and and and oil they'll praise god for this praise god for that yeah but what's it doing in you amen praise the lord so i pray the grace of god that we're into the revelation a man that pleases god and that revelation is giving us the faith i'll tell you we need now amen we do and brother i pray you keep focusing on it when it comes to the written word keep focusing on the resurrection the rapture amen if you're spiritual and not religious if you're spiritual brother the holy ghost is there to focus you on what he's doing and what he wants to do amen when it comes to the resurrection and rapture so brother again not not just to the revealed word but it's the written word brother and the revealed word has got to got to correspond and blend with the review the written word amen brother what we're pre what we're preaching what we're believing here we've got to have the proof of it here oh yeah or is that in the word did god say this yes god said this amen so the grace of god that we stay with the word amen brother is not and again it's not our idea of religion and our idea of the message is god's yes and that's why the prophet of god said even before he left the scene he knew he was going to leave he said here i am he said at 56 years old i see my inn coming he said at 56. yeah that was in around easter time in 1965 and before christmas time he died amen so brother is to focus on what god wants us to focus on believe what god wants us to believe amen and get the faith that god wants us to have amen do you have the faith that pleases god amen and if you have the faith that pleases god it's focusing on the resurrection and the rapture brother's not focusing on on the years past not focusing on even even 60 years ago no way brother i tell you this because god in the ministry of william branham changed his ministry amen and he went from the signs and the wonders because god said leave it don't do that no more because the people are leaning on a signpost amen and they are and they have been for years and brother if there's anything they're looking for in a ministry it's signs and wonders but i tell you it's the end now and god's looking for the resurrection rapture by the grace of god amen so are we spiritual or religious amen are we spiritual in our hearts or just religious in our heads and in our flesh brother let's be spiritual amen spiritual sons and daughters of god we see we oh yeah we see religion we see this you see this god did this god did that but if you're spiritual you'll see what god's doing not what he did amen thank god for what he did but thank god for what he's doing and thank god for what he will do brother again if there's anything that god is god is working on right now around the world is the resurrection of rapture amen so god help us brother no matter where they're living i pray god help the the elect seed of god amen the true seed of god it's like somebody was preaching somewhere folk testimony about a certain thing oh i might even i don't know where it was now he's in a church and they're saying well oh god's going to do this and god's going to get somebody here somebody there somebody there he said he out of every every culture he said god's got somebody and i said yeah i said well and it's not just us it's not just newfoundlanders and it's not just the white just the black yeah and the yellow and so on and it's like i said i said oh yeah i said sure i should uh we we we we acknowledge that when we dedicate a baby and i said you know i said we said we acknowledge there's the yellow the red and the blue i said god's going to going to bless them those children and there's as part of that chorus that we sing so god help us brother in the name of jesus amen that god's not looking down and pressed with our knowledge of all the doctrine amen brother he's looking down to see if all those things are giving us a greater greater resurrection faith and a rapturing faith that's what god is looking for in you and me that's what god is looking for in the bread amen the resurrection and rapturing faith he has come down to be united with her and there is an invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen but i tell you this he's given her a promise and giving her a word amen what for to get out of here by the grace of god get it amen so that she's going to meet with him in in glory she'll meet with them and sit with him in his throne amen praise the lord for the marriage supper of the lamb to god be the glory amen so let's make sure you're spiritual and not religious if you're if you're religious you're going to focus maybe oh brother brown said this he said that and so on yeah but thank god for the faith how many thinking we thank god for doctrine we thank god for this idea this revelation yeah buddy right away the revelation of the resurrection amen that many feel that all we got to do is believe god sent a prophet all we got to do is believe god through the prophet revealed the mystery of god revelation 10. and so when he did this he did that yes what god did but why did he do it he didn't do it without a reason amen so are we are we manifesting the reason why he did it the reason that why he did that brother is god making it flesh in you and me amen praise the lord that's right brother when it comes to the resurrection it's going to be in you and in me amen oh you're looking for the resurrection no i found it really i said he found me amen it's not me finding him he found me amen by the grace of god and i'm not looking for a rapture he found me hallelujah brother and i tell you this he gave us the experience of the of the resurrection amen in the new birth amen and he's given us the experience of the rapture the change we were caught up up up and the words being revealed revealed revealed amen we're not he's not he's not just making us religious now go to this church and go to that church no go to the word stay with the word amen stay with the word and it's the believers are not gathering together in a church but it's a gathering together for fellowship around the world amen so that amen so that we'll what we're doing we're feeding our faith praise the lord we're feeding our faith that's where we come sunday after sunday or wednesday after wednesday amen because we recognize that we need the word amen to increase our faith we need the word to to strengthen our faith amen we need the word to keep us moving by faith amen amen so god is challenging us through the ministry of the word he challenged the world through the ministry yes of the pentecostals he challenged the world through the ministry of willem branham amen and we're here because we accepted the challenge to walk in the light amen to walk in the revelation of the word amen so i trust trust by grace that we are spiritual and we're we're experiencing the spiritual presence of god where we're recognizing the spiritual moving of god and what god has ordained and promised to do amen praise the lord grace that we are spiritual and not religious the religious end up out there like denomination but the spiritual is in christ amen and what's what's christ therefore the resurrection the rapture amen because he said i am the resurrection he that believe that liveth and believeth in me shall never die amen i'm trying to explain that to churches out there you know and certain individuals in those churches that really believed that when did when you die you're gone you don't know nothing you're dead and i said no he that liveth and believe in the name shall never die amen and i said though we were dead you surely live amen by the grace of god brother we were dead spiritually but now we've been resurrected amen and knowing that spiritually i promise you get out linda that's again what it is praise the lord in your new birth your new birth is is the evidence of the resurrection and the rapture amen because it's christ in you amen in your heart amen and praise the lord and we're caught up into heavenly places for the revelation of the word amen to give us more and more and more faith and to give us more and more of our relationship with jesus you know what he's doing it's bringing us closer and closer and great amen is bringing us into a greater and a greater oneness with our lord amen oh my brother sister i pray god that we're so spiritual that we hate the carnal stuff out there we ate the carnal things that they're trying to get our attention on yeah we hate it why because we want to stay with him amen so god of all grace help us today to stay with the word to focus on our relationship with the word oh i got a relationship with jesus if you got a relationship with jesus you got a relationship with the word amen he's going to keep bringing you back to the word amen brothers as jesus met again the woman at the well and he just expounded to her the word amen this and this oh she said we know that when messiah comes he'll do tell us those things he said i am i am that messiah and she ran into the city amen oh she never i don't i don't think that they respected her very much in the city amen considering who she was and what she had done but i tell you hallelujah jesus respected her amen and that's what puzzled the disciples when oh they were waiting down there but jesus when he saw this woman he moved over to the well you know why because that was a tradition in israel brother because those that never had a good reputation or they they had a certain time to go to the well and get water amen and then there was another time well where the so-called you know real true believers or whatever they were gentiles they would go at another time but jesus went up when that woman was there oh lord something wrong amen surely they were they would accuse jesus of breaking the law of god no no he was the law of god amen and he he knew he knew who she was he knew what she was guilty of amen oh she told he he told her this he told her that oh my you must be the messiah massage is going to do that he said i am amen just saying she ran into the city she never had much of reputation for herself no she didn't mind she said oh come come come come see a man who told me all that i did yes yeah he revealed this she revealed that oh and she was caught up she was caught up into a heavenly place amen and she went went testifying to the rest of those in in the city there and come she said it's not this the messiah amen she believed it and some of the others believed and no doubt they didn't stay with it grace to us amen and grace to us to stay with what god is doing in this hour amen let's not focus on what he did oh yeah the the this church over there that's what god did a hundred years ago what he did you know over a thousand years ago that's what he did two thousand years ago listen what's he doing now amen and this is where so many fail amen to to find the lord and to find what god is doing what god wants to do is why because of their religion and what do they see this is he that but not the revealed word amen amen anything that the true elect of god wants is is to know where god is and what god's doing now i know where he was 55 60 years ago in pentecost and what he was doing what's he doing now because as i said as a young man and a teenager in pentecost and i went into a pentecostal church and they preached and they preached and we were screaming and praising the lord amen and at the end of the service got around the altar got done on our knees and we were praying and screaming and praising the lord and i remember one time on a wednesday night service we went we went into that church and and for a part of it we were worshiping god singing the praises of god then the anointing came down and and everybody began to get up and worship and there was a lot of young men and women there a lot not like it is today because they're getting less and less and less in the church amen i've had individuals in certain churches say oh my there's a pastor you know in denominational churches oh my she said i used to teach sunday school she said because there were so many children there and young people there but now she said there's hardly anyone there to teach for a sunday school so she's that that that's gone and they agree with me regarding regarding the what the prophecy says but concerning the last days amen and brothers but they don't recognize the word they're not not aware of what god is doing amen to inspire us but like i said back when i was in that church and those young people like we were teenagers oh why i remember one time we went down into the basement of course and they had sunday school rooms there but they also had a at another chapel down there a big one upstairs but a smaller one downstairs and oh i can see the myself and the young people and with their hands up in the air and we walked around and around and around and around the chapel and praising the lord and worshiping god oh i pray god bless those young people wherever they are amen now that they'll be my age now for sure and maybe some of them a little bit older amen amen but brother the bride is going around and around and around in the word thanking god for the word and we're getting more and more to the greater revelation of the resurrection the greater revelation of the rapture amen we ought to becoming more and more conscious of what god's doing brother we ought to feel the awkward pull amen brother if god god has ordained his predestination he's created a hunger and a thirst it's a pull there's there's a seed of god down there and they're hungry for this amen pull them up amen pull them up so he sends the messenger he sends a prophet and he what he reveals the mystery of his word to give us the faith to go up amen it's not to run the ear and do this and start this church in that church no it's a focus to people on the end focus the people on the resurrection focuses on the rapture and there's so few that are really putting their emphasis on resurrection rapture amen god help us brother please in the name of jesus so that you'll never forget what god's doing amen to god be the glory amen sorry there's going to be a business part of the meeting so uh i'll try not to be too long because we want to want to understand that there are deacons they want the word to go forth and then they want a song service and then the song leader returned them turns over to the the business part our brother paul amen so the grace of god amen still i won't get into the messages and all the quotes that i want to share with you but just let me leave you with this this understanding as brother brown preached three kinds of believers what for he said i'm i'm ministering this i'm preaching this amen he says so that it'll challenge you he said to decide what you are so are you a believer are you a make-believer or an unbeliever and as always he said three kinds of believers in every church amen so i'm preaching on spiritual religious amen to challenge your faith do you have a spiritual faith or religious faith there's quite a difference amen but eternal life is only in the spiritual faith god help us so in chapter 3 again of first corinthians and he said i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ so can god minister to us because we're spiritual we're mature and we're not immature just babes no no you got to grow up paul said listen he said i fit you with milk milk milk milk and broth this is the hour he's when you should be old enough now to take the meat of the word and they and they weren't he was still delaying what he was doing amen he fed them milk he said i have fed you with milk and not with meat for either two ye were not able to bear it amen i tell you it takes takes the anointing of the holy ghost to enable you to bear the meat of the word there's too many preaching milk milk milk milk oh that's good that's good that's good yeah but if you're going to preach the meat of the word it challenges your faith amen believe us thou this amen as jesus was talking to martha concerning the largest rising from the dead he said he was going to he said he'll rise again oh yeah a lot of people believe like martha oh yeah he'll rise in the resurrection in the future no he said i am the resurrection so the resurrection is going on now and the baptism of the holy ghost is the resurrection and the rapture in you that's right and you read ephesians 2 again and you'll see it the first few verses we've been resurrected and on down to this sixth or seventh verse we've been raptured into heavenly places in christ amen but are we experiencing what the prophet promised would happen in christ is he revealing his word to you and me and increasing my faith increasing your faith and giving us more and more victory over the devil amen i tell you probably god said he said listen he said he said the devils and every all the devils he's in all the demons in hell he said are religious oh yeah he said they believed god but they're not spiritual they're religious amen that's why he come down in the garden of eden yea had god said amen oh yeah this this and this but i say and he and he gave her back well 99 the scripture yeah as i said the devil working through the serpent in the wilderness there and the serpent was the first evangelist yeah because he he went out looking at the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen and brother and the serpent came and said and said what is under the anointing of the devil amen religious but not spiritual amen giving the preeminence to man but not god grace to us and that brother again we know where scientists say that this is how this is how everything started you know back there yeah no but the serpent when when god came and judged him he cursed the serpent yeah oh yes brother he was an up he was an uplight creature like a man yeah he was but god said now he said on your belt on your belly should you go in the dust he wasn't doing it before the judgment but after the judgment and they they have recognized too that in in certain certain serpents there that they have they have spots on on the on their bodies up here down here and they said wonder where'd they get those spots under finally someone came and told us yes that's where he said he was a serpent an upright creature like a man and he had arms and he had legs but god took it off and he became just like a serpent in the dust of the earth amen oh my thank god see that's what happened there and that's why jesus was virgin born none of us were virgin born physically amen no not by any means we were born in sin yeah the original sin amen jesus was without sin and it was the virgin birth amen so i pray god of god by grace help us keep our balance in the word amen thank god for what he did thank god for what he's doing amen to god be the glory again verse chapter 3 and verse 1 or verse yet one and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto colonel and brother brahm did highlight it in in some quote that this kernel was religion religious he said even as under babes in christ i trust we're not a baby in christ anymore we're maturing beyond that amen i have fed you with milk and not with meat for other two we were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able i believe that you're able to bear the meat of the word now that's why we're still here because we're going and feeding feeding feeding on the meat of the word amen so grace to us to keep feeding on the word on the meat amen so he said i fed you with milk and not with meat and it for other two ye were not able to bear it neither yet are ye able i trust we are able to take whatever word that god's going to preach that you're able to take it but please don't let it just fly over you take it judge yourself by the word oh thank you lord for the word and thank you for deliverance though i pray gracie you're going to give me more and more power more and more of the anointing lord so as to keep me more and more in the word amen by the grace of god and he said for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men now we understand why there's so much of that in different churches around the world because they're carnal they're religious but they're not spiritual yeah see the power of god says something he said listen he said sometimes god will send the devil among you yeah he said you see let the devil come into your presence and you know into a church or a group what for he said and then he he'll influence influence this person influenced that person and they'll do this and they'll do that and god allows it what for he said to see what see if you're going to take sides that's what he said he says going to see if you're going to take sides with this with this or you're going to just stay in the middle and move on amen and pray for them encourage them and just move on no there are those that are not going to stay in the middle there are those that are going to going to condemn and try to do this try to do that amen brother where's the holy ghost amen yes he said there is among you envying strife divisions are ye not carnal or just religious and walk as men for while one saith i am a paul another say i'm apollos are ye not carnal and you want to come under this ministry this ministry that ministry right there that's carnelity that's religion amen brother god god used that ministry for this that ministry this ministry the other ministry and brother don't focus on just under one ministry you got you got to take the word amen you gotta you gotta face your challenge amen of the word amen look into the word see yourself amen is that me lord am i guilty of this and like yeah that forgive me lord help me to overcome amen by grace amen so brother that we believe walketh not children walk as men and he said in verse 5 who then is paul who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollos watered and god gave the increase amen praise the name of the lord and go with me to first corinthians chapter 10. and again verse 1 praise the lord amen let's be sincere by the grace of god when it comes to our faith again make your calling make your election sure and oh i pray god to give the understanding to our young brothers and sisters here that they'll know this is not a church just a church and we come to worship god yeah and then we go home we come to worship god and go home and lord bless us bless that yeah but god's working on us what is he trying to do it's not just to make you feel good and do this and do that no he's trying to get you into the into the revelation of faith and of the resurrection and the rapture amen brother because there's nothing else for us to focus on this is the end for the gentiles amen it's the resurrection it's the raptures so let's let's lord keep an anointing the brother or the brothers that preach anoint them lord to increase our faith for the resurrection lord anointing to preach yes amen preach it to increase our faith for the rapture amen lord to increase our faith to trust you increase our faith to love you oh lord increase our faith so that it just brings us into a closer and closer and closer relationship with jesus amen brother so that jesus don't feel ignored amen you gotta you gotta focus on jesus when you're hearing the word all right my lord i need i need you so keep keep ministering lord amen amen so i believe that it is not brother's journal ministry it's not brother jonathan ministry it's jesus amen he's in the ministry he's using the ministry amen to god be the glo that's the problem of god even william branham it was jesus using him but he used him in a greater way than he's used in a sense that he's using us amen we were able to get up and do what he did in discerning the thoughts intents of the heart past present future amen to know this to know that and so on no that was god for sure the gift that he promised in the last day he said i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord amen grace to us amen see first corinthians 10 and verse 1 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant now that all our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and it all eat the same spiritual meat but they were destroyed and it all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but it didn't save them it met their needs what they were focusing on amen but joshua and cadet was focusing on something greater and as i was thinking as the lord is our attitude and our spirit and our actions and reactions i said as zealous as joshua and caleb to go into the promised land they want to go in go in go in go in and now that as i said that the jews that were there listening to them they picked up stones they were going to stone what yeah because all they were emphasizing was giddy and giddy and god said god said god said and if god be with us he said who can be against us yeah they had that so we do we had the same zeal same enthusiasm that they for to go into the rapture as they had to go into the promised land we're going to take our state we're going to stay with it amen we're going to keep believing it we're going to keep keep claiming it by the grace of god amen and it says with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness amen now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted god help us no and there's many believers lusting after the things of the world out there not necessarily sinful things but things that appeal to their flesh oh makes me feel good i like that i like that yeah this too shall pass away amen as i have even almost every day when i'm doing this i'm doing that i see this and i see that i said lord the promise is to destroy it all help me not to put no great emphasis on this no great emphasis on that let me just lay it all aside and move on with you into resurrection and rapturing faith grace amen turn with me just a couple scriptures galatians chapter 6. just a few pages ahead of first corinthians galatians chapter 6 praise the lord verse 1. in galatians 5 he said in verse 25 if you live in the if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit amen not just talk it walk it amen let us not be desires of vain glory provoking one another envied one another no let's provoke ourselves to god amen and let's love the lord and love one another and pray for one another amen let the strong support the weak by grace brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual amen and we're challenging our experience do you have a spiritual experience or religious experience amen so if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted don't condemn your brother your sister encourage them pray for them amen but i tell you this if you're going to condemn them you're religious all right but you're not spiritual amen oh it's like the disciples condemning the woman at the well but jesus went over and expressed his love for her soul amen to god be the glory be on your guard because we live in a very condemning world they're right there to condemn they're right there to charge you right there to do this and we're there to do that amen but brother if we got christ in us we're going to have the same attitude jesus at yeah praise the lord yes let me read it again brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual uh let god prove your spiritual because in a church god allowed this to happen allowed that to happen amen what what her to bring it those who are spiritual and those who are religious be careful be on your guard amen oh but the brother did this the sister did yeah what do you do amen what did jesus do amen he laid his life down for us oh that struck me oh i said lord i said do we really really love you i said are we really sincere in our relationship with considering i said lord what you did considering what you did to redeem us considering what he endured the pain the agony the sorrow the losing of his blood the crucifixion why my do you love him considering now what he did and what he's doing for you amen he's there to defend you he's there to encourage you there to strengthen you he's there to keep keep moving you on but look what he did when he was here brother just think again when he was when he was in in in the prayer and he cried and cried and cried and he was it was such a burden that the angels from heaven came down to to strengthen him amen he laid his life down for you and all you've done contrary to the word you should if i tell you if you got the holy ghost you will love him amen brother the sufferings that he endured mother not just for me not just for you but for the sins of the whole world oh what agony i said lord you endured that for me forgive me we ought to be humble when we consider what jesus did we ought to be humble amen we got the holy ghost we will because the greater greater revelation we got of jesus and what he did we humbled ourselves in his presence amen restore such a wonderful spirit of meekness not condemn them not do this not do that just restore such a one and just pray for him and move on leave it with the lord amen and it says restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted don't let self-righteousness cover in you no none righteous no not one amen it says bear ye one another's burdens this is tremendous and so fulfill the law of christ amen for if any man think of himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself amen but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another amen every man shall bear his own burden amen grace to us grace and go with me to first peter chapter two and i'll share with you a couple of quotes and let's turn to our brother bob first peter 2 and verse 1. wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking be careful lay aside i pray you've got the revelation of it that god that god wants you to have amen don't because sometimes we take things and and oh yeah well this is this big so they're going to take their stand against it and condemn this one condemn that one no no how big is it in the eyes of god sometimes it's bigger in our eyes than it is the eyes of god amen so lay aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings not some but all as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby and if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious amen we need to humble ourselves considering what he did for us but still there's too many it's just religion thank you lord i accept it and move on no it's like in a in a service one time of the prophet and there was this woman there she stood up and she was praising the lord and she was in the congregation there and she was crying and crying and crying and thanking the lord for redemption and there was a gentleman there who had attended the services and so on just having a religious spirit like and he saw her two or three services in a row doing that and he went to the altar and they thought he wanted prayer he said i want what she got why because he saw that re that that spiritual attitude of repentance even though she was a christian but she wanted thank god thank you jesus for what you'd done for me and he said i want what she had yeah they said and they prayed for him and god blessed him and god anointed him amen and he come forth with the same attitude that she had amen same experience she had thank you jesus she said you know people don't consider how great redemption is amen don't consider what jesus really did and now he suffered for you are you willing to suffer for him grace amen and it says in verse 3 if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as onto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious hallelujah ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ not religious but spiritual amen as lively stones built up a spiritual house not your physical or one you're living in at a certain street you know the one you're living in here amen and you're built up a spiritual house you're spiritual and people that know you that is fellowship with you they know you're not carnal like the world you're spiritual amen so he said a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ are we this spiritual are you that spiritual in your relationship with god amen that you are are you a lively stone built up a spiritual house not a religious one spiritual amen a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices amen acceptable to god by jesus christ amen and he said verse 6 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a cheap cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded amen you love him because he loves you amen you love him because of what he did for you and what he's doing for you amen the devil is there to destroy you and get rid of you jesus is there to keep you amen brother what would satan do if jesus wasn't there to defend us jesus is going to do that yes he's doing that i was like i prayed and i said oh lord please i know there's maybe millions around the world that are calling on you for help so i said lord excuse me i said your grace and your will be done amen just a couple of quotes and i might have shared that with with them with you before in 1956 he said there was lot going along just as religious as he could be and lot was very religious why it even began way back when cain and abel he said cain a modern man came to the church and the altar amen came built a church what am i trying to say to you i'm trying to tell you friend that just going to church and making a confession and doing good works will never save you you've got to be born again amen it has to come as a spiritual revelation not intellectual spiritual look at cain if you could just look at those two boys cain and abel we'll have we'll leave the text right here and go back for a minute he said look at cain look at abel one was religious and the other spiritual and oh he said may i stop here just a moment to say that i believe that these nations are getting their last mercy call he preached this in canada in edmonton alberta amen and i believe it i'm on record and i'm on tape saying it but i believe it with my heart that there's not a person on earth who could ever shake this thing back to its conditions again he said it'll take the move of god the second coming of jesus christ and he's a look at the differences in the people today look at how unconcerned they are they're eating they're drinking they're marrying their given in marriage just as it was predicted having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof amen and the bible said from such turn away he said very religious and they're always been very religious but not having spiritual insight to understand and he said that's the main thing he said that's the thing that designates your eternal destination is your spiritual conception because a lot of people are religious but not spiritual so are you spiritual amen spiritual he said that's the main thing he said that's the thing that designates your eternal destination your spiritual conception but now he said cain worshipped all of his carnal works just like the carnal church today and they go to church they worship and cain worship he wasn't an infidel he wasn't a communist he said cain was a believer he went to god you only talked to god god talked to him but he was just religious he wasn't spiritual amen oh yeah he had a beautiful as i i preached that years ago on empire avenue that i said which church would you go to i explained what abel's church was like and i said here he had a dead lamb blood all over the place and he got blood on himself i said would you want to go to that church or would you prefer cain's church oh oh he had a beautiful altar there and it's like thanksgiving days to now in in the denominational church world all they they put this here and they put that there it's all beautiful and and and kane had all these the things that he grew the crops and everything and all my everywhere that's what they do today cain's church are still doing it oh yeah when they have thanksgivings and they put this on the altar okay abel put a bloody lamb on the altar amen so i said which church will you go to and thank god we had a visitor at that time he was never in that church before but he came in just to see what we were like and after that service he said pastor he said thank you he said i never heard that before but he said you're right he said thank you where he is now i don't know pray the grace of god damn amen so brother are we cain or abel are we religious or spiritual as i let me ask you again as i asked you quite some time ago who are you are you adam or eve yeah are you able or cain are you enoch who walk with god or noah are you abraham or lot are you isaac or ishmael are you jacob or esau are you joseph are you one of joseph's elder brethren that betrayed joseph and sold him into slavery yeah yeah and joseph conducted himself to please god in slavery in prison oh yeah no matter what he was doing or he didn't lay aside his faith his faith kept him amen praise the lord it's like praise god the prophet god has highlighted it it's like that black brother that was sold for slavery in the united states and there was a man came to that farm and he was looking at certain ones there and he said he wanted to buy this slave that slave that's life always he said i want i want to buy that one why because he saw that one working as no other one worked he was right into it amazing and he said but can i have that knowledge that he's not for sale he said well look he's doing he's doing his work so don't worry he's right into it he's doing it he wants to do it he wants to do it right you got to do this do this do this he's not fighting anything no he said he's not and he said i wondered about that the owner and he said until he said i learned that back in africa his father was the king of the tribe and he said he conducted himself as a son of a king there and he said right here he's still conducting himself as the son of a king and that's why he said his heart is right into whatever he wants what we want to do he will not hesitate he will not slow down he won't do this he's gone to do it perfect he said he's still the son of a king yeah and brother brown brought that out and he said yes he said that as he conducted himself he says so we ought to conduct ourselves because we are sons and daughters of the king amen do you know that you are god god's give birth to god yeah and so our our heavenly father gave birth to us in a new birth and you are god's amen that's right in glory you're you're going to be recognized as as god because there is jehovah god and there is his sons and his daughters and they are gods no wonder that the bible says they'll he said i'm going to sit you here sit you in this throne and do this and do this and he said they'll come and bow at your feet recognizing that you're a god amen you're the son of the living god you're the daughter of the living god amen your god amen so are you joseph or his elders are you moses or dathan are you jesus or judas like i said there's not much negative in the bible about judas just just where you deceive and betrayed christ and he must have been very good because like i said none of the disciples knew jesus said this one of you shall betray me they said me this one this one they never said oh it must be judas no he must have been he must have seemed to them to be spiritual he was religious but not spiritual amen so i pray the grace of god keep your attitude right keep your spirit right amen so we want to be jesus not judas and remember to betray your brother or sister in the lord you betray jesus be careful amen so are you a wise virgin or a foolish virgin amen again as i preached on it and uh some of the ministering brothers never heard it before they they they were shocked what i said yeah i says people going to hell i said not because of what they did but because of what they didn't do what i said jesus said and as much you didn't do it onto these the least of my brethren you didn't do it unto me so i said be careful you might be judged for what you didn't do not what you did oh i didn't do this i didn't do that well be careful what does god want there's lots of things god require that there's a lot of believers don't do it and because you didn't do it you're condemned god help us amen well he said and as much you didn't do it to me to them he said you didn't do it to me you want to do something for jesus oh well there's one of his children there you do for him yeah no oh yes that'll condemn us one day so make sure you're going to do all god wants you to do amen you're going to be controlled by god controlled by the holy ghost so that it's not what you didn't do that you're going to do it and jesus told him to depart into everlasting fire they were gone amen and as i said a brother must have heard about it because he called me on the phone he said brother he said this is absolutely amazing he said i'm going to preach on that i said good i said here's the scripture you need oh he said good he said thank you amen brother so are we wise virgins are foolish and yet you're still a virgin probably god said now remember there's still virgins but he said one is wise and that was foolish because the foolish got caught up with the natural things where's the where's the the wise got caught up with spiritual amen so are you sheep or goats are you a believer or a make-believer god have mercy amen so brother cain was very religious and he said the churches are very religious and they've always been but not having the spiritual insight to understand he said that that's the things that designate your eternal destination is your spiritual conception amen that determines your eternal destination it's the revelations that god has given you but now he's a cain worshiped all of his carnal works he said just like a carnal church today they go to church they worship cain worship he wasn't an infidel he wasn't a communist cain was a believer he went to god he built an altar and he done every religious thing that abel done but he didn't have the spiritual revelation of the will of god blessed be the name of the lord there you are do you see he said he didn't have the spiritual revelation that's what's the matter with the church today they don't have spiritual revelation and jesus said he built his church on spiritual revelation he said you get it oh my your eyes come open now he said the spiritual revelation cain come he built an altar he worshiped he brought sacrifice he knelt down he praised god he worshiped god he done everything religious that abel done and god flatly refused him because he didn't have the spiritual revelation of the sacrifice god god wanted abel did amen not just to please god abel knew that amen abel wanted a sacrifice to cover his sin amen now cain is on his line and there were everyone very religious very famous people they were scientists doctors and builders and workers smart men but all that lineage was rejected from cain all the way down and on abel's side they wasn't builders not educators not smart men they were a more or less humble sort of sheep razors and peasants that just walked by the spirit amen the bible said there's no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the spiritual man has a spiritual soul that can never die and the carnal man has a religious atmosphere all around him and he wants to worship but his colonel believer and it's a kind that was rejected amen and he said that's the way it is today that men are satisfied in their condition and there is a way to of escape and that's the way it's through jesus our lord jesus christ amen and he said there you are he said the same tribe the same spirits and they were absolutely religious men very religious but they missed the covenant vow amen they missed the calling oh if they want to join a church they get the biggest city the best and well thought of in the city how far they missed the calling yeah the only way you will ever know jesus christ is by spiritual revelation amen not by theology not by how much you study the bible whether you be christian science methodist jehovah's witness or whatever you are no matter what you are you will never know it by the word it's the spirit of god that reveals him to you amen it's a spiritual revelation amen and the antichrist is a religious spirit amen and the people are going to get caught up with that religion in the great tribulation amen and he said 1959 he said how can you worship lest you know what you're worshiping amen how can you be spiritual unless you've got the holy spirit in you amen and if you've all tied up with a bunch of church creeds will make your act make you act like a church people and dignified in religious and things like that that's all good moral acts but brother you've got to be born again by the genuine holy ghost that only comes by the word of god amen and true word of god when it comes to you it'll manifest the truth for he the holy ghost when he'll come he'll testify of me you'll manifest truth he'll take the things that i have showed you amen to take the things i've said and we'll show them to you amen the holy ghost will they're spiritual not religious so brother let's make sure that satan is not going to get us under a religious spirit controlled by a religious spirit but pray the grace of god is there to keep us under a spiritual anointing a spiritual relationship with jesus a spiritual relationship with god so that you can confirm well the prophet said in three kinds of believers who are you are you a believer are you a make-believer or a non-believer amen so are you spiritual in your life and in your walk in your talk are you spiritual are you carnal or religious make sure you're spiritual to be make sure you're spiritual is to make sure that he's in control amen not the devil that jesus control you brother grace that we're not going to we're not going to come under what the prophet of god preached in 64. spiritual spiritual amnesia what spiritual amnesia is forgetfulness yeah someone that's controlled with a problem of amnesia mean that you forget and the prophet of god highlights it and he brings it out and about what the church it started with this but then it forgot it and laid it aside he's saying that there's so many now still caught up with amnesia spiritual so i pressed by the grace of god that we're not going to be deceived by spiritual amnesia and fall down under just a religious spirit god help us amen grace god bless you let's stand thank you for your patience well the bible says you have need of patience amen so god has maybe put me here as pastor to train you in patience amen to test your patience amen but i think brother jonathan would do the same thing amen because he ended up he went on and on and on and on and on that's good amen there's not many not many christians who can see can think it's good but god does amen jesus went on and on and on amen so we pray the grace of god that we're not going to we're not going to worry about time why because we're more in contact with eternity amen so we pray that eternity will keep controlling us amen and keep controlling our brother john on wednesday amen so the lord bless you let's sing higher ground three five five three hundred and fifty-five i'm pressing yes amen
