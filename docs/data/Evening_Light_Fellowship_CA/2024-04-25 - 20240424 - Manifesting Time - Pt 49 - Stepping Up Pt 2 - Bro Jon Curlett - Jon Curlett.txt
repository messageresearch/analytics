of this building Lord the people in it Lord the speaker the hearers Lord each and every one Lord won't you just hit the mark As Only You Can Do Lord Lift Us higher Lord let us see your word let us see ourselves in your word Lord and let us step into it tonight by Grace and Faith we ask in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if we would to First John chapter 5 1 John chapter 5 amen a couple missing I know brother Bob and sister Bren have gone to kill Mory for arrest so we trust that God blesses them gives them a break and I forgot but I think brother Joe is also traveling away for business or something so we trust God's grace to be with him amen sure enjoyed that song service brother Josh it was just perfect as I said just trusting that the Lord is leading us this evening amen 1 John 5 verse 14 says this it says and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him amen God bless you you can have your seats we're continuing again in our series on manifesting time I want to take a second service on this thought of stepping up and we ended last service with a quote where brother br's talking about how we can be so yielded to the holy spirit that God would identify himself with that person and I want to start there just so we can pick up and roll right into the the next portion of this this series tonight brother brah says he's speaking of Christ and he's saying just think that a person so yielded until God identified himself in there in that body and him and God became one Jesus said I am my father are one my father dwelleth in me I do that always which pleases the father he says what if the Christian today could have a testimony like that you would be a masterpiece right here on on the street then he says these simple words he says if you're a washwoman out there behind the washtub you still be a masterpiece to God when you can say I do that always which pleases God he says and the whole world can see the work of Jesus Christ reflecting in you and I love this because so often when we preach we focus on the brothers they're the heads of the homes they're the leaders in the church they're the ones that God has ordained in the five-fold ministry and these things but we're going to dwell on the sisters tonight tonight amen so brothers let's hold in there let's let's let's pray and let's let's enter in and work with our sisters here but as I said the brothers so often get the focal point but you'll see here that the sisters have a great part to play amen and I I know I was talking to a brother not too long ago and he said some of the most powerful people I know in the bride of Christ are women they're just not publicly known by these things but he said the manifestation of the spirit the the gifts that God has placed in the body he says many of them are in women and it's faithful women that are just sitting under proper headship amen and they find their place in these things and we opened up with this scripture in 1 John chapter 5 and there John says if we ask anything according to God's will he hears us the key will see when it comes to adoption is that we are in his will we're not just in the position that he's placed Us in but within that position we're there because we can find the will of God and we're not going to focus on that that's going to be a focus for another service in the future Lord willing about how do we find the will of God but I want you to see that when you seek God's will and you find it then you can ask with confidence because when you found his will now his word is behind it his power is behind it his authority is behind it his promise is fully behind it because when you seek his will it's not just the object or it's not just the action but it's the timing it's the motive it's the objective it's all these things that need to feed in and when we can find ourselves in that place then God will answer our prayers because we've stepped into his perfect will so I want to say tonight we're not going to talk about finding his will but I want to say Seek the will of God above all else seek the will of God and say Lord what would you have to me to do where would you have me to be how would you want me to act in this situation and when we do that then our every need is supplied amen God's behind us and everything but I want us to start tonight on an example here because when we come into adoption we believe that the promises of God are their Force we believe that the blessings of the Kingdom of Heaven are their Force we're stepping into full Authority with God's word behind us and so many times that means we've got to take the word as his word anden we've got to take it personally we've got to step into the promises we've got to step into what God has told us to do and we've got to believe it's for us amen we've got to believe that it's mine it's not just yours but it's mine amen and so if we're children of God and we're living under the word of God that means we ought to be able to claim the promises of the word for us but how we claim things is often what's tied to our real maturity and we're speaking about stepping up we're talking about coming into a place of adoption of thinking and acting the way that adopted Sons and Daughters do so I want to start with a with a promise here and then we're going to go into an example of somebody finding their place in that promise and in Deuteronomy 7 it says this and this is Mos is speaking he says know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God that alone ought to make us stop sometimes and say let's let him be God Amen let's not step on his toes he says he is God he's the faith God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations you love him and you do what his word says He says he'll keep his commandment no matter what his Covenant with you in verse 11 he says Thou shalt therefore keep the Commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I command thee this day to do them wherefore it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he swear unto thy fathers he says he'll do everything he's done for those in the past if you'll do what those in the past did God never changes if you step into your his word the way others have he'll do for you what he's done for others we we sing that song it is no secret what God can do what he's done for others he'll do for you but you've got to meet him where they met him amen and that's under the the presence of his word but I want you to catch this now in verse 13 He says and he will love thee and he will bless thee and he he will multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn and thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kind that's your cattle he says in the flocks of thy sheep in the lamb which he swear under thy fathers to give thee God says I'll bless everything you touch and everything you have if you'll just stay with my word amen what a wonderful place if we can find ourselves there today if that's what he would offer under the law how much more would he offer it under grace but I want you to catch this verse 14 it says Thou shalt be blessed above all people and there shall not be that means in no circumstances will anyone male or female be Barren among you or among your cattle God promised the children of Israel Israel if you'll stay with my word if you'll stay with my Commandments if you'll keep the ordinances that I've told you to keep he says I'll bless everything including I'll give you children that was a great sign of wealth amongst the children of Israel was that he would bless them and multiply them because remember the the promise that he gave Abraham was that he would multiply him greatly and so when they had children it was the literal fulfillment of what God had promised to do in Abraham it was the great Covenant that Abraham had told them to do and it was a part of their blessing anden now I want us to see because if we're in our position in Christ then every promise in the book belongs to us can we say Amen that to that this evening if I'm in my place then every promise will be will it won't be held back for me but I want us to see something amen we're going to see what happens and come up a little higher when it comes to the promises of God and and maybe step up in our understanding and maturity tonight we're going to go to a very familiar story here and it's the story of Hannah now we've just read in Deuteronomy 7:14 where he says there won't be a single one that's Barren amongst you now is that the promise of God or is it not it's his promise right nobody is going to be Barren then we go to 1st Samuel 1:1 it says there was a certain man of ramth Zim of Mount Ephraim and his name was Ela the son of jeroham the son of elu the son of toou the son of zof an ephrathite that's a mouthful he says and he had two wives and the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other was panina and panina had children but Hannah had no children now in the in the in the Old Testament times being childless was considered a reflection of a woman's spirituality and if she did not have children it meant that God had forsaken her because she was disobedient or had a secret sin somewhere why because God had promised that you're going to have children and now here we see a woman that has no children and the other wife has children and now people are looking down on Hannah Hannah doesn't have the promise Hannah is not blessed of God Hannah must be be doing something wrong I wonder what's going on in Hannah's life she always seems so good why is God not blessing her how often must she have asked God to give her a child to take away her reproach she's sitting now under the reproach of not having the word in her life God promised it and she doesn't have it God promised it she doesn't have it and no matter how much she asked no matter how much she goes to God nothing's happening Hannah is living under the reproach of living under the promises of the word she has nothing of what God promised from Deuteronomy 7:14 it's not in her life verse three says and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and to sacrific unto the Lord of host in Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hne and Phineas the priests of the Lord were there and when the time was that elaa offered he gave to panina his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions so ELCA when he goes there he gives them a portion of the offering he says but unto unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion that word worthy means double he gave her double what he gave anybody else he tried to make up for her situation by favoring her he tried to make her feel good about not having the word promise it says for he loved Hannah but catch this now it says the Lord had had shut up her womb God has promised you won't be Barren and then God make her Barren how does this work how does this work how is this fair church we're stepping up tonight a little bit God says I'm going to give it to you and then god holds her back there is nothing wrong with Hannah's body nothing wrong with Hannah's body but God has held back children from Hannah God's putting her through disappointment God's putting her through scorn he's putting her through persecution he's bringing her down in the eyes of the people that are around her he's making her life miserable amen Church where do our minds go in tough situations so often we go immediately to this is Satan's work and yet the scripture says the Lord had shut up her womb see we've got to be able to check ourselves and sayl where am I is it me Lord cuz if it's not me then we ought to be able to have faith that there's a greater thing going on than just what we think it is amen we're talking about stepping up we're talking about coming up higher and watch what happens in verse six and her adversary this is panina the other wife also provoked her SAR for to make her fret make her worry make her wonder why am I like this why is she blessed and I'm not why does she have the word promise and why don't I that is never the working of the holy spirit is to make you wonder and fret the Holy Spirit brings faith it brings rest it brings trust it brings confidence in the word of God this is not God that's giving her an adversary now this is Satan that's giving her an adversary to try and keep her focused on the situation through the wrong eyes it says because to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb in other words the other wife is saying God has cursed you you're out of God's blessing you're out of God's will you're not a real believer you're weak in the faith God hasn't shown you any favor Hannah had to Bear the reproach of not having the word promised in her body verse seven how long does this go on and as he did so year by year church God knows how to work on us God knows how to work on us year after year after year Hannah takes reproach Hannah takes persecution it says when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat see that was supposed to be a time of Thanksgiving That was supposed to be a time of Praise a time of appreciation and this woman is rubbing Hannah's face in the fact that she's not blessed she's not blessed in the way that Hannah wants to be blessed above all other ways now watch elaa typical husband then said alaa her husband to her Hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not I better to thee than 10 Sons am I not enough Church it ain't always about the spouse it's not always about the situation Hannah had a cry in her heart she had a desire for the word to be produced in her body she had a desire for God to give her the promise that he had made all those years ago and nothing could quench it nothing could quench the cry in her heart everything in her body everything in her mind everything in her spirit was screaming out I need a child I own a child I have a child I there's a promise for me and I'm not going to let go until I get it but it ain't easy because she's never getting the desire of her heart year after year after year years after years year by year the scripture says she goes back and no promise no promise no promise church if God puts it in your heart stay there if he puts it in his word and then he puts his word in your heart stay there and trust that he's going to work it out but will we hold on till we get it will we hold on and say say Lord I trust you and I believe you we're talking about stepping up now now catch this they go and they go year after year after year but eventually there comes a year where God's timing steps into it says in verse 9 so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by the post of the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept so Hanah is not in a great State of Mind here Church she's not feeling it the only thing she's got here is bitterness and she's there and she's crying out to God she's got a word desire she's got a Godly desire and bitterness has crept in because God has not answered her prayers we pray and we pray and we pray and we wait and we wait and we wait and nothing happens and we say God where are you what's going on I'm in my place I'm faithful you know my heart I've sought you there's nothing in my life what's going on but I want you to see even in her pain and bitterness she never stopped seeking God that's one thing you can say about Hannah she never stopped talking to God see so often we want to hold it in listen listen God gave us emotions God gave us feelings he knows how we feel whether we tell him or not he knows what's going on in our mind it's okay to let them know how you're feeling it's not okay to stay there though but it's okay amen let's not seeking him because we're bitter let's not seek him let's not stop seeking him because he hasn't given us the answer we've sought for even if it's his word promised yet let's not stop seeking him amen Even in our disappointment Even in our conf confusion so many times Lord what is it is it something I've done no son no daughter it's okay keep pressing listen in verse 11 she says and she vowed a vow Church God's got a way of bringing us around to exactly where he wants us because remember what adoption is adoption is about your heavenly position and purpose and God's got a work that he's trying to do through each and every one of us and he's got to get us to a place where we'll step into our purpose and once we do that the floodgates of Heaven open says she vowed a vow and she said oh lord of hosts if thou wil indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmade and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but will give unto thine handmade a Manchild not just a child she wants a son she says then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his hand what did Hannah do do she finally said the right thing Church in her bitterness in her disappointment in her desperation she said Lord I'll give my blessing back to you I want to be a mother and your word promises me children but what I'll do is I'll give you the first fruits the first thing you give me I'll give it back to you for your service if it's a son I want a son I'll give you a son and I'll dedicate him from the day he's born to your service she put him under a Nazarite vow she says I'll take my blessing and I'll give it right back to you verse 12 says and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth he noticed her mouth it says now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard she was just mouthing the words therefore Eli thought she had been drunken and Eli said to her how long wil thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee and Han answered and said no my Lord I'm a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but I poured out my soul before the Lord don't hold back from pouring out before God how many times do we get in situations and what we do is we spiritualize our holding back half the time all God wants is a honest conversation from your heart that's all he's looking for church is you to say I don't understand I don't know I don't I can't even comprehend what's going on here church I know by experience there's things we pray about and it doesn't happen but we have a word promise we can go chapter and verse and say you said it but we don't have it it's okay to say we don't have it but let's not say I won't ever get it because your word says I'm going to get it so I'm here to remind you of the promise and that I'm here as your son I'm here as your daughter saying this is mine and I'm here to let you know I'm expecting you to back your word up if I'm in your position then I'm expecting you to back this word up amen oh we swallow it so many times let it out pour it out say God I don't understand Lord I'm right where you told me to be I followed you as best I know how what's going on why am I left hanging here let him know you're bitter let him know you're at the end of your rope let him know you got nothing left in the tank that's a great place to let him be God when we're at the complete end of our rope amen but whatever you've got you give it to him and say Lord I need you but if you give it to me I'll give it right back to you I'll put it into your service Hannah says count not thine hand made for a daughter of bile for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto the the Amplified says for out of my great complaint and bitter provocation I have been speaking in other words she's saying God has let me down and I'm here and I'm sharing him how that's affected me like I said so often we spiritualize it I'm German we we we swallow our emotions no matter what we feel God never asked us to do it but we don't dwell in it we don't let ourselves hang out in those things but there's nothing wrong with letting God know I don't know what's going on I'm disappointed I'm hurt I'm feeling offended I did my part and you're letting me down but just remember he's God he knows all things he sees all things watch Eli's answer he says then Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee thy petition that thou Hast asked of him and she said let thine handmade find Grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad she took the man of God at his word and church Hannah's attitude changed now it didn't change when she gets a baby it changed right then she took God at his word then she took that priest that high priest as the mouthpiece of God and she said I believe it I'm accepting it and she went and she ate and it says her countenance is no more set she wasn't she wasn't down in the mouth she wasn't an eore anymore it says and they rose up in the morning early and worship before the Lord and returned and came to their house in RMA and elaa knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her it says wherefore it came to pass that when the time was come after Hannah had conceived that she bear a son and called his name Samuel saying because I have asked him of the Lord in verse 16 and 17 says it went her way you know what hand his victory that she needed was over herself that's the first thing that God had to deal with Hanah on was her attitude and as soon as he got her attitude right then he could give her the promise because her attitude now allowed her to give God what he needed out of her Hannah would be given a son and the baby's name was Samuel why did she name him that she named him after her Victory she named him after her experience Samuel means God has heard and she says because I have asked the right way God has heard because I kept asking God has heard because I went to God God has heard anden she went to the right place she said the right thing she reminded him of the right thing and when her attitude came in alignment God gave her the promise because she stepped into his perfect word church when God hears us victory's coming Victory is coming when God hears us because God never moves without purpose and without effect we notice El canaa had two wives here he had Hannah and he had panina but I want you to draw your attention to something panina crw used through life panina never had any issues panina had Sons panina had daughters panina had a husband that paid her attention she had every blessing of the word without any work but you know what panina did with her blessings she used them to persecute somebody else God couldn't use panina panina was horrible under the blessings of God can you imagine what would happened if she was the one that was under Hannah's curse so to speak God didn't choose panina the one that had it all to produce a prophit he chose Hannah because through it all Hannah kept coming back to God Hannah was a daughter of God Hannah was a real believer even in her bitterness even in her pain even in her suffering in her persecution she kept coming back to God Hannah in all of those things never stopped going to church she never stopped listening to the priesthood she never C stopped praying to God she never pulled back from her relationship she kept going back to him every single time even in her pain even in her suffering there was an eternal difference between Hannah and panina they weren't Cut From the Same Cloth they weren't brought from the same Source if you want to put it that way Hannah's everything that happened drove her to God and all panina did was persecute even under those blessings of God shows that within the framework of Believers there's those that are and there's those those that pretend they are Paul talks about it in Romans 9 he says he's speaking of the Jews he says who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises the people of Israel had all the promises of God he says whose are the fathers and of whom is concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God bless forever amen Jews have the natural bloodline of Christ if we want to we know that's not true but carnally speaking that's the way it looks he says not as though the word of God had taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel Paul's saying not everyone that's in the chosen group is the chosen people they're named amongst the Israelites but not every Israelite was a child of God we know that from their time in the desert only two came out of the 2 million two one in a million I was a true Son of God the rest died by the wayside because they weren't a part of him in the first place not all who call themselves Believers are believers not everyone who says there's a Christian is a Christian not everyone who says they have the Holy Ghost has the Holy Ghost amen but there are those that are born for a purpose there are those that are produced because God ordained them to be in that thing John 1 says this but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name you can only believe on his name if he ordained you as his son or daughter if you come from him in verse 13 says which were born every one of us is born every person in this world is born but there's some that are born of blood that some that are born of the will of the Flesh and of the will of man but Paul says that's not us he says which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God we are born of the will of God God chose Hannah he ordained her her adopted position was to produce a prophet that would be ordained and given to the service of God from his very Birth by her choice by her will God didn't force her into it she did it of her own free will her adoptive position was to ask God for a son the right way with the right reason that's the only thing God needed out of Hannah her entire life was to Bear Samuel that's it that was all God wanted to do what did she do Church she found his purpose in her need see so often we're focused on the need God says how about you look for the purpose in this and as soon as she finds God's purpose she steps in and her request becomes his will and God gives her the desires of her heart what was she doing Church she was stepping up she was coming into a higher plane a higher understanding she was stepping up into God's thoughts of her life and situation let me put it this way the reproach in Hannah's life was God's favor can you understand that look at Joseph the reproach that Joseph bore was the favor of God to raise him to the right hand of pharaoh and to save the very people that persecuted him in the first place for all we know Samuel made all the difference in their kids' lives after that Samuel was a prophet he led the he led the people of Israel Faithfully never made a foot never made a step wrong as far as we know Samuel never did anything wrong he wasn't perfect we know that because he was human but in his leadership Samuel was perfect he was perfect that was the gift that Hannah gave to Israel when she stepped into her position that was the edifying portion of Hannah where she brought a prophet and she dedicated him from the day he was born to the service of the Lord and she let nothing get in there to to get him dirty or mess up his life life for these different things Hannah's reproach was God's favor to her can we see that in our lives sometimes I've had things taken away from me that I thought I should have been able to keep I've gone through health issues I've gone through money issues I've gone through church issues I've gone through Ministry issues I've gone through people issues I've gone through work issues and you say that ought to be mine no God's got a purpose Above All God's got a purpose amen and that's what he's trying to do as adopted Sons and Daughters is to bring us fully into that purpose and start looking at things the way God looks through it and to seek after his will and his way and his sight and these different things Hannah wanted the child to remove her reproach to stop the persecution to shut panina up once and for all to show the rest of the of the community that was a good woman a spiritual woman a Godly woman she wanted it for herself but when she turned her desire loose and said God I'll give it to you that's when God could finally start working with Hannah Hannah wasn't allowed to just be a mom Church she had to be a mom of a prophet she couldn't be like the other moms she couldn't be like panina she couldn't be like the other ladies at church she had to be a special kind of mom a mom that would hold her children apart from everything in the world that first child had to be perfect perfectly raised and God needed a woman like Hannah to do it and so he put her under reproach until she come to the place to get into his perfect will we read this quote last time but let's put it into context now he says but if each one of you in here has not now has not been positionally placed you might be nothing but a housewife you might be nothing but a Hannah this morning this evening he says well you say brother brandom I never done a thing in my life I'm not a preacher well maybe God brought you here to raise a family of children and out of that family of children may come another family of children that'll be a preacher that'll send a million souls to Christ he says you had to be here you're here for a purpose he says did you know that see we don't see that far down the road God sees all things but but God's trying to pour out his blessings on us but he's trying to help us find his purpose in his Blessing he's trying to help us see there's more to Blessings than just giving them to you they're meant they're given with purpose they're given as a testimony they're there to show the hand of God in your life they're there to differentiate the sons of God from the sons of this world from the daughters of this world from the daughters of God and sometimes that means that reproach has to come first that hard times have to come first before the promise comes in our life we want Power what are we going to do with it we want to write big chanks from the checks from the bank of Heaven who's going to benefit what's our motive what's our objective brother Ram says you want healing what are you going to do with your healing do you just want healing to be healed or do you want healing to glorify God to put your health into his into his purpose into his benefit for the kingdom in these different things our desire as adopted Sons and Daughters of God is always to glorify the father that's it and we don't even enter into those things it's not about us it's always about him brother B puts it this way he says the only way that God can preach the gospel today is through that lump of clay he says and that's why he's keeping you here he says now that's why you sick people have a right to come to Christ and say Lord Jesus if you'll only heal me now I'll go I may not be a preacher but I'll talk about it I'll do everything I can you are the vine I'm one of the branches he says now the vine doesn't bear fruit the branches bears fruit not the vine the branch the vine only puts energy into it see we want the power of the Holy Spirit we want everything in God's kingdom behind us but to do what produce fruit that's the work of the Holy Spirit that's the evidence is to produce fruit and fruit is not for the sake of the tree it's for the sake of those that are around the tree as we've talked about before he says the gospel can be preached by Christ how if you'll open up yourself and be a branch that'll bear forth fruit he says others can see Christ in you by your testimony by your life and the way you live he is the energy but you're the picture show you're the walking Bible see what happens so often is we look at God's word and we know God's word is his will but we want to turn God's word into our will rather than what turn God's word into his will by submitting ourselves to it we want all the benefit without the purpose see that's immature thinking that's childish thinking it's for me no it's for him it's always for him it's always for the Kingdom Purpose amen if we want to use it for our benefit then we forget that the word of God is given with purpose always cuz it goes out to do something and that something is a purpose it comes back after a while having produced those things if we can get ourselves into his purpose not ours that's when the real power comes cuz then we're just stepping perfectly into his path amen that's when we can have faith that's when we can have expectation that's when we can have hope is when we say Lord I know I'm in your will we've read that quote before where brother Brandon was asked are you ever scared on that on that platform I don't know what you do what I do if somebody walked up with somebody in a wheelchair with full expectation of them being healed I can't heal them I don't know if I've got faith enough to heal somebody in a in a wheelchair I don't imagine I do yet but if God told me that today somebody's going to come up in a wheelchair and if you'll lay hands on them they'll be heal guess what I'll have the faith then brother Braham says every time if he's told me to be there I have no fear I trust him because I'm in his will in his plan I was reading and and maybe we'll share this at a different time because it it plays into another portion of adoption brother B would talk about other ministers and he says they've got their their campaigns booked for years ahead of time he says I don't know where I'm going to be tomorrow cuz what he's not saying they're not led by the Holy Ghost but he says my Ministry is instant in season I've got to be able to go when he goes remember when he he's he's supposed to go to his plane and the Holy Spirit leads him away from the plane and he ends up going and praying for that boy that had a venial disease and the the mother was was out by the the fence leaning over it and he walks by she says howdy Parson and he gets past her and then something clicks and he says how do you know I'm a person I've been praying to the Lord this morning and God took him away from his airplane made him think that he missed it to go pray for a Praying woman's son that's the kind of leadership he had so he says I may be planned to be somewhere next week and I may not make it because the Holy Spirit leads me it's about stepping into his will and that's what produces the reality of God Sisters You Are called to produce the reality of God by raising your children in the admonition of nurture of the Lord that is your place that is your position that God has put you in you're not just wives and mothers panina was just a wife and a mother you're called to be a Hannah you're called to be there with real purpose that the desires that God has placed in your heart for your children from his word that's an adopted position for you to lay hold of to step into and say this is mine Lord you've told me what to be you've told me what your bride's supposed to be and I'm raising a portion of your bride he's given little Souls into your hands dads don't get the time with them that mothers do brother bandam called you the Fifth Gospel that's how great your lives are the impact that you have and God has chosen you personally specifically for your family for your husband and for the children that are there David got a revelation of being made perfectly do you know that David got a revelation that he was built for the task we see it in Psalms 139 because David learned to rely on God's choosing of him rather than his sight of what he looked like and how he thought he could fulfill it David wasn't caught up in his abilities David was caught up in God called me and anointed me and that's what makes the difference but po but but David would say this in Psalms 139 he says I will praise thee can we praise him this evening why can David praise him for for I am fearfully and wonderfully made that word fearfully means specifically David said I am specifically you know what wonderfully made means awesome I literally looked it up in the office and it means awesome but it's not awesome in the way of this world it's awesome in that it is a reflection of the work and the power of God Church you are awesome tonight but not awesome the way this world looks at it you are awesome because God has built you with him inside of you David said I can praise him because he built me with a portion of him that's what he's saying and he built me specifically for my life that's ahead of me he says marvelous are thy works you did a good job God that's what he's saying David saying God you built me right and you know what Satan tries to do you're built wrong you can't do it look at you look at you comparative spirituality like we talked about they're better therefore I can't he says and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee he says the way I'm built it wasn't hit from you he says when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the the lowest parts of the earth you know what that curiously rot means it's it's talking about the blending and adding of colors together to produce a particular shade in other words some intelligence has to come and just blend everything together to produce exactly what was in their mind that's what David said God did with him he says Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect before the work was done he says and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them in other words he says all our life was written before we were born the way I was built the way you built me the purpose the UPS the Downs the victories the overcoming it was all built in and pre-planned he says how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them the sum of them see we tend to look at things at specific moments it's a high it's a low it's a good it's a bad but but David says the whole sum of it he says that's a wonderful thing when I can see the full picture you know what David's saying he's saying when God picks he picks the best when God builds he builds the best he build you exactly as is needed to do it and then what do we do we sit back and we say I'm not smart enough I'm not good enough I can't do it I'm not as good as those next to me not smart enough not driven enough not disciplined enough what do we do what are we saying we're saying God you picked wrong God you built me wrong have we had those moments where we say this ain't a good idea I've talked about it in Ministry for myself God this ain't a good idea I don't agree I think this will not end well and I'd rather not learn I'd rather not go through the public embarrassment of failing listen church we can do all things through Christ which strengthens us Paul said it's Christ in me that makes me anything that I have that's good today but on the flip side what does Satan do see God says you're the best and we say no we're not God says I made you exactly the way that you're needed and we say and then what does Satan do he comes behind he reinforces that right Satan beats us up on our temper our weight our lack of discipline our dirty house the simple cooking beans and weenies macaroni weeners chicken noodle soup every day and he says you're not a mother you're not a good mother you're not a good wife you can't do this you can't do that you know what you ought to say sisters Satan what does it say about you that God picked a little weakling like me to kick you out of this house to have overcoming power inside of this home by the authority of the headship of my husband under Christ to take you and kick you out of this house anytime I want to women when you can sit there and say God has wonderfully made me God has specifically built me to destroy the works of Satan inside this home it'll change our attitudes forever when when we get up every morning when you get up every morning and you say I'm built to destroy the works of Satan in this home that's when you start stepping into your adoptive position because that's your first order is the family that God gives you and the home that your husband provides for you you're not here because you loved your husband because he chose you and you said yes you don't have kids because you have a loving relationship you have them because God ordained them and he ordained you to help raise them you know what's funny Satan likes to beat us up when we moved to Mount Pearl from killbride and we moved into a bit of a rougher area there near the the the low income housing and whatnot and we went up and they wanted to play against us in different sports and I've said before the first time we played them in baseball it was just me and Nathan and Matt and Adam four of us and we took on the whole neighborhood and we beat them 20 to nothing I think in two innings then the next game we beat them 20 to1 or 19 nothing something like that in in three Innings and so then they went to basketball and we beat them in basketball then they went to hockey and that was even worse and we were dominating the neighborhood but then we'd be playing on a Wednesday night and and we'd say well we've got to go now where you going we're going to church so they started calling us Church boys Satan calls us a lot of names but you know what I've said and I know I've said this before I said you'll notice that the church boys keep beating you maybe you need to go to church Satan keeps pushing your butt and say Satan whatever you say I am I'm still beating you and remind him that he's the loser in this one you've got the Victory and he's under your foot he's under you because you're a part of the body of Christ and it says everything is under him he has no place to stand in your presence he's just bluffing you to make you think you're less than he is and you're more than conquerors through Christ but I want you to see Hannah's finish I want you to see how Hannah treated this cuz cuz Hannah went year upon year upon year without an answer to her prayer and then she finally gets that answer and she gives it back to God and she gives it to God without holding back without bitterness she gives it she gives Samuel right back to God but I want you to see what God does in 1st Samuel 2 it says and the Lord visited Hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters daughters says and the child Samuel grew before the Lord what was Hannah's desire for CH for a child what did God give her he gave her five what's five Grace Grace it was God's grace to Hannah she gave away everything she had no promise of a second child but she gave the only child she had back to him and God came back and he gave her grace upon Grace upon Grace upon Grace five children he filled her quiver filled her quiver and she got to enjoy the full benefits of the promise of the word of God now because what she gave the first fruits she gave the glory to God she gave the child to God church God knows how to bless us God knows how to answer a prayer the way we could never even imagine listen to this brother Bram said this I thought this was a beautiful quote brother Andrew Glover shared this the other day he said now Joshua when he come to the end of the trail through the wilderness he needed a bridge to cross over Jordan into the promised land he needed a bridge he says but God's provided way was a power not a bridge he sent a power and he held the river back and he walked across on dry land that was God's provided way not a bridge he had a better engineer so he just sent him power and pushed the water back until he walked over on dry land can you imagine Joshua and he's praying for a bridge and if all he is looking for is a bridge he's going to be disappointed but what does Joshua do Joshua comes up to the water because God says on the third day you're going to go over and then cross over and Joshua only has to obey and God makes the way that's all he had to do listen to this he says Daniel for the cause of God was thrown into a lion's den he needed a fence but God sent an angel what a difference that was God's provided way he needed a fence but God gave him an angel and what a better fence it was he says he always gives you better than you ask for always he says he needed a fence but God sent him an angel the Hebrew children they needed some water to put out that fire he says but God sent them the fourth man that's all they needed he untied their hands and talk with them they walked out without the smell of fire on them they needed water and he sent the fourth man what's he saying he's saying sometimes the limitation on God is what we're trying to put him in a box about we're saying Lord and we're praying and we're praying and we're praying and we're directing God and God's saying if you'll just let go I'll give you more than you could ever ask for we're saying I want this and he's trying to pour out a bigger blessing and we're limiting ourselves by our little peanut brains can you imagine if Joshua was praying for that bridge and he never got it it but he didn't pray for a bridge he prayed for leadership and he followed God's leadership and God made a way through that's why we need to seek the will of God above all else then our prayer will get right then the answer of God comes amen if Joshua is praying for a bridge he's got the goal right to get into Canaan to cross over Jordan but the path is wrong the the way of doing it wrong seek leadership not giving God his answer we can't put God in that box Paul said this in Ephesians he says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith this is a the Walk of the Believers by faith always but he says that ye been rooted and grounded in love this is a love relationship first and foremost if you don't know that he loves you and if you don't love him it's not going to work you've got to love him back and with that love comes trust and with that love will come Faith as well then he says that you may what be able to comprehend now that word comprehend us means understand but in the original it doesn't mean that it says that you may be able to obtain that you may be able to lay hold of that you may be able to experience with All Saints what is the breadth the length the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God God's wanting to pour more into you than you even realize God's wanting to do more in our lives than we could ever expect or imagine Paul says it now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us he says you've been given something the holy spirit inside of you can bless you more than you could ask or think you know what that tells me if I can get my thinking and my asking out of the way God can probably do more than I ever expected sometimes all we have to do is say Lord here's the need and I'm trusting you it is amazing I hope to share a testimony with you in the next 12 to 18 months of one prayer with a simple answer something I literally just prayed about yesterday and I hope to see it happen in the very near future not telling God how to do it not trying to make it happen not trying to manipulate and move things around play the chessboard but just say Lord here's the need I'm putting it in your hands I want to give that testimony and I'm believing I will I'm excited I'm excited because when we can free ourselves from our own little minds and say God you're God God I'm going to let you be you and I'm going to be me he says according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the Church of Christ by Christ Jesus throughout all ages the World Without End Amen don't raise your hands to this question but how many in here have been praying for something for a long time and you haven't got it and you can say brother John I've got chapter and verse book chapter verse and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and I don't have it I believe there's many in here have it I believe there's many in here that are doing it but hold that on your heart as we move forward this is the last portion that we want to talk about this this evening but hold tight to your promise hold tight to your promise cuz he'll never fail if you've got it in his word he'll never fail amen no matter what you can see no matter what you don't see I I read this the other day I think brother Jason Watkin said it he said faith can move mountains sometimes one Pebble at a time and the thing is we'll never notice the pebble we'll never notice it but it's moving nonetheless and as we've been preaching on here this evening sometimes the mountain that needs to be moved is our will and our perspective that's all sometimes the battle is in here it's not out there and God's just trying to get us to step up into how things are supposed to go sometimes we just need to sit sit back not sometimes every time we need to sit back and say God the promise is yours the word is yours the power is yours I'm just going to rest in what you said I'm just going to take you at your word and I'm not going to back away I'm not going to pull it back I'm not going to set it aside but I'm going to say this belongs to me and I'm going to trust you to do it I'm going to trust you to do it Paul said this this is one of the most beautiful scriptures I believe it says for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed that word ashamed means disappointed whoever believes on him will not be disappointed Whoever has faith in the promises of God won't be left disappointed just don't put your faith and God in a box say God I've got faith in you and I'm going to let you do the work amen we had a moment before church where my youngest I told him to get ready and I said put your shoes on and so I got his shoes down for him I gave him the means of getting himself ready and I said put your shoes on and he said okay and he started to put his shoes on he started to put on the left one first and he he struggled with it for a bit and then he said Daddy I can't put my shoes on and you know what I said yes you can cuz I knew he could and you know what he had faith that I was right even though he didn't think he could do it and he bent down and sure enough within 15 seconds he had that shoe on so you would think having done it once he'd believe it for the second one but you know what happened he started the second one and then he said Daddy I can't get my shoe on I said yes you can keep trying and you know what happened he kept trying and 15 seconds later he had both shoes on what did he have to do he had to have faith that Daddy was right so that he could get his shoes on I wasn't going to go down and put on I've seen him put his shoes on I know he can put his shoes on but he didn't have faith in himself but when daddy said yes you can it reinvigorated him to try again and sure enough all of a sudden he had it remember brother Brandon would say he he'd have people coming up and and and he said they'd have all Faith they thought they'd have all faith and they didn't have any and then he said somebody would come up and he'd say you didn't realize you had that much Faith you didn't realize you had that much Faith but you had to have somebody re-energize you they had to just come into the presence of of the Holy Spirit they just had to come in a presence of somebody that said no you can do it and then they'd step up and they do things that they didn't believe they could which was what believe to receive their healing that's what God's trying to do saying you you can do it have faith keep with it and Watch What Happens Hebrews 10 what happens after we believe Paul says cast not there away therefore your confidence which had great recompense of reward the a Amplified sayso not therefore fling away your Fearless confidence you know we enter into decision sometimes we enter by faith into the promises of God and it's under the anointing of the word maybe the the the presence of the holy spirit is is so powerful the unctions there and what do we do with great Fearless confidence we step forward and we claim it do we not we do of course we do we're Believers he says don't throw that away he says don't fling away your Fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward but after you have the Fearless confidence he says you have need of patience because what God doesn't always answer right then he says that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise there is often a gap between your doing and your receiving Fearless confidence starts us patience takes us to the end and it's Faith he says for yet a little while and he that shall come will come come and will not t now the just shall live by faith the Justified shall live by faith he says but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him he says but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul I think one of the hardest things for a Believer to do is to pray and by faith accept the word of God and then wait and wait with patience and wait with rest in a trusting heart it's one of the hardest things to do when nothing is moving and you've done all you can what does the scripture say having done all to stand stand stand stand hold fast stick with it we see or hear the word of God and we jump at it and something strikes our heart and we say that's for me and we claim it and then what happens nothing nothing and more nothing and sometimes it goes on for minutes days weeks years there's things that I've prayed about for literally decades and still hasn't happened yet but I've got a promise for it where's my Faith Church look around and tell me it's not the truth we've we've got kids that aren't serving the lord we've got families that are torn apart we've got relationships that have been severed we've got healing that hasn't come we've got issues that haven't been resolved we've got hurts pains offenses all sorts of things and we can pray and we can lay up before God and lay up before God and our faithful prayer our expectations there and then what do we do that's what Paul's saying check and see what you're doing cuz sometimes in our flesh what do we do we lay it down and we say what we make an excuse and we say it wasn't for me you don't find excuses in this word God doesn't give excuses God's word doesn't change and he never backs away from his word but you know what we do we back away because it doesn't happen in our timing or in the way we thought it was what Hannah needed first was a change in her attitude before she could ever have that child and sometimes God's got to do something in here before he can do something in this or in our families or in our relationships or whatever these things are you I'm reminded of brother brandham brother brandham sent literally with a gift of Divine Healing to the entire world and he suffers with stomach trouble until the last two months of his life and he goes year after year decade after decade preaching Ing and and restoring healing and hold bodies to people to thousands hundreds of thousands maybe millions of people in his entire Ministry and he never received his healing until two months before he died but you know what he never backed down he never gave an excuse he never said it's not for me he just what stayed faithful to his calling and he prayed for people and they' get healed and he'd never get healed and he prayed for people and they get healed and he never got healed and he never got bitter he wondered but he never got bitter and he never tried to make an excuse for himself and he never tried to make an excuse for God he laid it in God's hands and he stayed faithful and he trusted God to take him through the pain and suffering to give him the victory in the end God made a God made a way through and to me it's a wonderful testimony of how we can bear what seems to be a reproach without giving up on our testimony without pulling back in these things I want to take one more example tonight before we close we're going to talk to the singles specifically the single sisters but it applies to all of us Acts chapter 9 says there was a woman there was at japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas and this woman was full of good works and alms Deeds which she did she was like a an early Mother Teresa except she was a child of God she wasn't in the Catholic church she was in the original Catholic Church she was a real angel of Mercy a Florence Nightingale maybe says and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died she went through pain and suffering without deserving it and then she died good woman given everything she can to the service of the Lord it says whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber and for as much as L was night of japa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring that he would not delay to come to them it says then Peter arose and went with them and when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them church I want us to see now what an adoptive position sometimes look like she her you know because we talked about it's not always so spiritual there's roles within the body of Christ that aren't going to look spiritual to the outset and here we see one what Tabitha's Ministry was to was to make clothes for poor people she had an Outreach Ministry that was completely natural helping people stay warm helping people stay clothed that was her Ministry that was her position in the body of Christ was to be Outreach in that way and this before the foundation of the world was her position this is what God had ordained for her to do and she gave everything she had to that role and then God made her allowed her to be sick and then God allowed her life to be taken she dies doing exactly what God had told her to do she's presenting Christ in the way that she knows best that God has laid on her heart matching her abilities to the ministry and she's giving to all these people and when she dies all of them gather around and they're showing them look how good she was look what she did for us look at the difference she made we need her and because they needed her still they said bring Peter sometimes that's what we need as Believers that say we still got a need here let's step into the Gap here it says but Peter put them all forth and kneel down and prayed and turned him to the body and said Tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and widows presented her alive and it was known throughout all of japa and many believed in the Lord church I'm trying to show you the power of being in your ordained position she was she was completely committed to the work of Christ in her life that ought to give us Faith this evening because Tabitha if you want to hear it this evening had a right to be resurrected the power of God was there to resurrect her because her work was not yet done and what did God do God had Believers there to believe and he had an apostle there with a gift to raise her an apostle with the authority to go before God and say God is it your will and if God says yes to have faith to raise that woman from the dead it wasn't happenstance that Peter just happened to be close by God had ordained these circumstances for his adopted daughter to let her continue in the work and in doing so she brought people to Christ her death and Resurrection brought people to Christ now we would sit back from that and say God why did you have to put her through suffering couldn't you have just struck her dead so she didn't have to suffer at least just let it be quick let it be merciful Let It Be painless but she had to go through pain and suffering despite being completely in her position why so that God could give her a testimony that was greater than her Works God was taking her way higher than anything she'd ever do on this Earth with a simple testimony that this is my daughter this is my child and nothing can hold her until I'm ready to let it touch her there's nothing that comes into our lives but God allows it now if we get out of his will we get out of his path that's going to be on us but nothing can stop us I'll read a quote later not tonight but in another service brother Braham says demons can do nothing to you except God God allows it because he holds Us in the palm of his hands God sent Peter all that way God timed it perfectly so that taba could have a resurrection testimony to go along with her adopted position is working with the the widows and the poor and these different things brother Bram says this he says it's those crucial hours that press us onto those sacred Sands it was in the Bible remember now no matter how great the distress is Satan cannot take your life until God God has finished with you nor can he hold you back nor can he keep you from achieving it he says there is nothing can happen to you unless God permits it there's no evil can come unless God permits it and it's for your good that he is working that he says let's think church we can look at our health we can look at our wealth we can look at our children our Ministries God can attack us or Satan can attack us and God himself has to allow it and if he does allow it it is temporary until God's done with us Satan can't lay hold on and hold something that belongs to God he says there when the floods came to destroy the world it could not destroy Noah Noah could not be destroyed because God had a work for him to do one day down in a great Nation Under a great bondage there were some great Hebrew children that we know as Shadrach and meach and Abednego and it came to a place where they had to make a decision that something had to be done their faith was put to a test he says now when your faith is put to a test test then don't fail stay right with what you believe see on the test the homework doesn't count for anything but the homework has been to prepare you for the test he's saying don't fail at the test cuz that's a pass or fail thing you got to make it past the test is what matters amen everything we've learned it's all brought us up to the test and he's saying when that test comes don't fall back now God's prepared you for it he says they went to a crucial hour not only did they go to an ash sheep they went to a fiery furnace but Satan could not destroy them for God's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled and when their faith was put to a test they could go in there with this hope that I know that my redeemer liveth they could go in there with this hope here we are assured that God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace but nevertheless we will not bow to this image Satan he says could not take them he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished he could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of God had been finished neither could the lions eat Daniel until God's purpose had been finished neither could death in old age take Abraham until the purpose of God has been finished God has a purpose and it will not be held back he says and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of God of our life is finished he says so we gather from from their consolation what that what we're going through what we're dealing with has purpose and it's not going to keep us back from God it's not going to keep us back from his will it's not going to keep us back from his blessings he says why does God let troubles come this is the great answer why do bad things happen to good people he says God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God can you imagine how Tabitha felt after all this she goes through sickness she dies she's raised from the dead what confidence that ought to have given her that God is with her that she pleased God that she had a purpose in these things if God will do that for a woman that makes clothes for poor people what will he do to you sisters that are raising children that are elect of God what can hold us back from his purpose what can hold us back from achieving what he's laid in front of us to do what won't God do for you what won't God do for you if you're in his will and in his purpose what won't he do when you claim salvation for your children what won't you do when you claim leadership for how to raise each one they're all different we know that we don't raise any one of our kids the exact same way we need leadership we need guidance and we go to him and will he turn us down no he won't he will give us what we have need of that little woman she's probably just a a little single sister no husband no children just being faithful to her calling and God used that little woman to put a beating on Satan and show that the keys of death Hell In The Grave had no power over a child of his unless he allowed it can you imagine the service they had after that listen Abraham got a they got a new body and they got a child from a body that couldn't produce a body but we're talking the power of the Resurrection we're talking about the power of the Holy Ghost demonstrated in the greatest way possible to raise somebody from the dead where's our worship how we ought to be able to worship church when he gave you the Holy Ghost it was his sign that nothing can ever hold you back does he care does he care it seems so often that he doesn't care why because he doesn't do it in our timing or he doesn't do it in our way and sometimes it's moving right along and often times we may even miss his answer because we're too busy looking for ours we have to trust his choosing we have to trust his timing his planning his placing and we have to trust him when he holds things back I said earlier that that that that I I prayed for things and I'm still praying for things that he hasn't answered yet and I have to trust that he's got a reason for it I've got to trust that he's got a reason for it when things don't don't go the way that I think I think Hannah is a great example and I want to finish with her as we start to close if we look at Hannah's final words we see her attitude we see her worship we see her praise we see her mindset after she's gone through this she's gone through years who knows how many years maybe 10 maybe 15 maybe 20 years of persecution of of being apparently out of the favor of God but we see Santa step up here we really do and in 1st Samuel 2 I'm going to read it out of the Amplified this evening as we start to close it says Hannah prayed and said my heart exalts and triumphs in the Lord my strength is lifted up who in who the Lord my mouth is no longer silence for it is opened wide over my enemies because I rejoice in your salvation she is not praising herself she is praising him she can't stop talking about Look What the Lord Has Done in my life look what he did after all this time I thought I was out I thought I was out of his favor I thought i' made a mistake sake I thought he wasn't there but Look What the Lord Has Done in my life she says there is none holy like the Lord there's none beside you there is no Rock like our God she can't stop talking about him now she was full of bitterness before then he changes her attitude and now all she has is worship she says talk no more so very proudly let not arrogance go forth from your mouth for the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weight oh you judged me you judge me you all judge me but look what the Lord says about me look how the Lord looks upon me church he understands Us in ways nobody else ever will and the things we do and sometimes we've got to stand and we've got to stand by our decisions we've got to stand by our leadership and people say what's going on why are you doing it that way stand there and Trust his leading he says let not arrogance go forth from your mouth for the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him action are way God proves all things he says the bows of the mighty are broken and those who stumbled are garded with strength the ones that had it all he says they've got no she says they have no power and the ones who stumbled they're GED they're bound up with strength those who were full have hired themselves out for bread those who had it all have to work just to get something to eat he says but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger the barren has borne seven but she who has many children languishes and is forlorn poor panina he says the Lord she said the Lord slays and makes alive he brings down to the ground and raises up the Lord makes poor and makes rich he brings low and he lifts up he raises up the poor Out of the Dust and lifts up the needy from the ash sheep to make them sit with Nobles and inherit the Throne of Glory for The Pillars of the Earth are the Lords and he has set the world upon upon them he will guard the feet of his Godly ones but the wicked shall be silenced and perished in darkness for by strength shall no man Prevail it's not going to be me gets me over this Finish Line church it's not going to be you gets you over there not your discipline not your good abilities not your good intentions not your church attendance these are all good things but it's by God's grace and his strength alone that we're going to get there he she says the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to Pieces against them will he thunder in Heaven the Lord will judge all people to the ends of the Earth and he will give strength to his King and exalt the power of His anointed has he held back from you this evening church let me tell you he's got a plan in it all he's got a plan to bring a testimony he's got a plan to bring praise he's got a plan to bring Victory he's got a plan to raise you up out of the hash Heap and help you sit and inherit a throne of Glory Glory there's been times where I prayed and you get to the point where you cry I've cried been flustered even pull back at times you know why because I forgot that he's God and I'm not and it's that simple I've forgotten that there's a place for him and there's a place for for me and his is up here and mine is down here and if he calls me up it'll be by his grace and mercy to let me see if only for a moment what he's trying to do but in the meantime I've had to learn how to trust CU everything I see is so limited I am so limited by my own abilities by the the natural senses we have by discernment we think we have these different things and I've had to learn to trust him in his provision and in his timing and if he holds back it's for my good and if he gives it's for my good there's times I said before he's taken away things I thought that were so good for me and in the end it wasn't and it was for my good that he took it away things I thought were bad and he he kept them in my life church it's not my thinking it's not yours about them being good or bad that makes them that way it's the end result that'll show what's good or bad in our lives the Harvest will prove it out amen but God's been in it all along and I'll tell you I've had a I look at my life and I look at decisions and I look at things that come and gone and in the middle of it sometimes you wonder sometimes you wonder is it me or is it him and is he there or is he not but when it's all said and done and you let the Harvest come out you see God was in it and when you had to wait and when you had to pray and when you had to get closer and closer to him and you had to trust and you had to lay down your will and you had to lay down your desires and lay down your timing and lay down your need to understand everything that's when God tends to move is when we just get ourselves down and say Lord I'm going to let you be God I'm going to close with this as the musicians could come last scripture Psalm 8411 says for the Lord God is a sun and shield you know sometimes we need the sunshine we know all about this in New Finland don't we let's stand together we know about needing the sunshine you know I think we've had three days of sun in the last five or seven and you go outside and you're just like a because we've longed for this this shining orb to be obvious and clearly presented to us to just feel the warmth of that sun and he says the Lord God is a son but sometimes he's a shield sometimes he's a shade sometimes he's a protection sometimes we need to get in the sun we need to get out of our little basement you know I work from home most of the time I'm down in my basement and sometimes you just need to get outside and walk around a bit and it changes your attitude and sometimes that's what he is to us is he gets us out and he puts some life into us he invigorates us but sometimes he's a shield sometimes we need to pull back and just take a break go to Kil Mory just say no once or twice and say Lord I'm just I need a break Lord give me a rest under the promise of your word where I'm not trying I'm not pushing I'm not I'm not driving but I'm just resting and I'm trusting you to make it happen he says the Lord God is a son and a shield the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly not self-righteously uprightly where you say Lord I want to live by your word and I'm doing the best I can you do that he says there's nothing good that he'll withhold from you if he's holding it back for now it's for our good and when he pours it out it'll be for our good as well amen God knows exactly what we need God knows exactly what's good for us when we need it to produce his word perfectly in our lives we read that scripture that said whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed let's bow our heads each one are you feeling disappointed this evening something you've laid before him and it seems like no answers come you've had all Faith given all testimony laid your life on the line laid your health on the line laid your job on the line laid your family on the line whatever it is it seems like he has an answered just a struggle after a struggle after a struggle after a struggle he cares church he cares all he's asking you to do is trust him Heavenly Father Lord you see our hearts you see our burdens Lord you see the ache not just in our heart but in our souls Lord when we see the needs around us Lord in our own lives in our own bodies in our own relationships Lord in our own children in this very Church Lord in our loved ones maybe with co-workers Lord and we look at your word and we apply it to the situation Lord but it doesn't always happen exactly as we think it will Lord and there's things I've been praying for for a long time lord there's things that people in this church have been holding to for days months years decades even and Lord we're coming to you this evening Lord and we're asking for your grace and glory to give us Faith Lord to trust you Lord to keep looking to you Lord to keep talking to you Lord let our hope and expectation rise I pray Lord let it not dim but when it gets dim Lord may we come into that sunlight that you said you'd be Lord when it seems like it's bearing down on us too hard Lord may you be that Shield that we've just read about Lord but may we above all these things seek your presence Lord seek your perfect will Lord and find ourselves in it Lord and having found your will Lord let us rest in it let us hold fast Lord let us trust I pray Lord let us step up into a higher understanding and Revelation Lord that you are God you do all things well Lord You've Got Us in the palms of your hand you won't lose a single one of us Lord and that any trouble we Face Lord It's a you've got a bti in its mouth and you're working to bring us closer to you Lord I pray you encourage us this evening Lord that we've seen that Hannah Lord could go through so long without a word promise but in the end you came through Tabitha faithful Lord lost her very life and you restored it so she could keep going Lord I'm praying for restoration tonight Lord I'm praying we'd have the praise of Hannah that we'd have the revelation of Hannah Lord that in you everything exists and consists that we have need of Lord that you raise up you take down you pour out you fill up Lord You Are God lord would you help us to realize it as we Face our trials Lord this evening Lord Our lives our decisions whatever it might be Lord where those blessings seem to be stopped up I pray that we would seek your will Lord and with it find your rest Lord will you give us Faith this evening I pray in Jesus
