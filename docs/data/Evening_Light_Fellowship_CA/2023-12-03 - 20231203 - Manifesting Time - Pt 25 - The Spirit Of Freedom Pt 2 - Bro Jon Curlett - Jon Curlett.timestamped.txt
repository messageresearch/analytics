[38:54] 1 Ephesians chapter 1 amen enjoy the
[38:57] song service this
[38:59] morning man good to be home and I enjoy
[39:03] going away and getting out in the woods
[39:05] and there's virtually no internet
[39:07] connection and there's no emails and no
[39:10] work but uh I'm also glad to be back you
[39:13] know I'm a home body I like to be where
[39:15] where I always am and so glad to be back
[39:17] here amen certainly appreciate the
[39:19] prayers had an interesting trip on the
[39:22] way out I had a SUV in the in the night
[39:25] swerving into my lane which was
[39:28] interesting but uh by God's grace he
[39:30] moved back or they moved back so I don't
[39:31] know if they fell asleep or were on
[39:33] their phone or whatnot but God protected
[39:35] me there and then I was able to go out
[39:36] and see brother Doug and sister Beverly
[39:38] and it rained almost the whole time
[39:39] going there and back especially at
[39:41] nights dangerous but he preserved me
[39:43] amen got to spend some time
[39:44] fellowshipping with them got to see
[39:46] brother back Samson went to see of
[39:48] course brother Barry and sister darling
[39:50] guy they let me use their cabin and
[39:51] their equipment for my hunt so we really
[39:53] appreciate that got to see brother Ivan
[39:55] Brenton as well as well and please
[39:57] remember him in prayer you know the
[39:59] doctors say it's just a matter of time
[40:01] for his wife and that's that's tough on
[40:03] him he's been married 54 years no
[40:06] children with her so it's the end of a
[40:08] road really for that relationship and we
[40:10] know it doesn't end here amen but you're
[40:13] you're left with a sense of loss so we
[40:14] want to remember him he's asked me to to
[40:17] handle the the funeral if and when it
[40:19] comes to that so just uh remember them
[40:21] and then I got to spend most of Thursday
[40:23] with brother Hank and sister Vera snow
[40:24] had a wonderful time of fellowship with
[40:26] them so I was very grateful for that and
[40:29] they'd mentioned how much how much
[40:30] they'd enjoyed spending time brother
[40:32] Mark and sister Moren when they were
[40:33] there recently so you know these Saints
[40:35] they need Fellowship you know brother
[40:37] Doug and sister Beverly the pretty much
[40:38] the only ones out there on the west
[40:40] coast and I was talking to them about
[40:41] that and just saying what an
[40:43] encouragement it is for for the younger
[40:45] ones to see people that stand and
[40:47] there's nobody else left it's just them
[40:49] but they stand there and they're
[40:50] faithful and and and they just are
[40:52] expressing the word of God for this age
[40:54] you know so remember those Saints and in
[40:56] prayer certainly but uh it was a good
[40:58] time and of course we did get the Moose
[41:00] as well so so it was a good trip amen as
[41:03] God was very gracious and I was thankful
[41:05] to to get that opportunity to certainly
[41:07] be with the Saints but also to to get an
[41:09] animal as well so we thank God for that
[41:12] amen Let's uh continue this morning now
[41:13] in the service Ephesians chapter 1 verse
[41:17] 17 Paul says that the god of our Lord
[41:19] Jesus Christ the father of Glory may
[41:22] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[41:24] Revelation in the know of him the eyes
[41:28] of your understanding being enlightened
[41:29] that ye may know what is the hope of his
[41:32] calling and what the riches of the glory
[41:34] of his inheritance in the Saints and
[41:37] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[41:39] power to usw who believe it's only for
[41:42] the believer church you've got to
[41:44] believe it says according to the working
[41:46] of his mighty power which he wrought in
[41:49] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[41:51] and set him at his own right hand in the
[41:53] Heavenly places far above
[41:56] not just above far above all
[42:00] principality and power and might and
[42:04] dominion and every name that is named
[42:06] not only in this world but also in that
[42:09] which is to come and ha put all things
[42:12] under his feet and gave him to be the
[42:14] head over all things to the church now I
[42:17] want you to catch this last verse
[42:18] because it says the church which is his
[42:20] body now it said in verse 22 that he has
[42:23] put all things under his feet and then
[42:25] it says who's his body it says the
[42:27] church is so that means that everything
[42:30] is under you I don't care if you're the
[42:33] lowest believer this morning I don't
[42:34] care if you're the rough scaly skin on
[42:36] the bottom of Christ's feet everything
[42:39] is under your feet because you're part
[42:41] of him amen there's nothing that can
[42:44] stand before you everything every Power
[42:48] every principality every might every
[42:51] Dominion every name that is named is
[42:53] under your feet this morning he says
[42:55] which is his body the fullness of him
[42:58] that filth all in all amen God bless you
[43:01] you can have your
[43:02] seats this morning we're continuing on
[43:04] our series and manifesting time and I
[43:06] want to take a second service on this
[43:08] thought on the spirit of freedom and I'm
[43:10] really enjoying this it's it's good to
[43:12] come in and you know you lay in the
[43:13] teaching and you you lay in the
[43:15] structure but now we're getting into the
[43:16] benefit side now we're getting into the
[43:18] the blessing side of the believer and I
[43:20] was looking at my notes last night and
[43:21] I've got 42 pages of notes on this and I
[43:24] don't know how much I can bring before
[43:25] it starts to sound the same amen but I I
[43:28] love to read about the good things of
[43:30] God I love to read about what God has in
[43:32] store for those that love him amen and
[43:33] so I want to bring another message of
[43:35] Freedom this morning and I want to say
[43:37] one thing this morning if you're a child
[43:39] of God you're free if there's one thing
[43:41] that defines us it's that we're free you
[43:43] know and and we can say you know I don't
[43:45] feel like I'm free you know I look at my
[43:48] life and I look at what I'm struggling
[43:49] with and I I look at I've got financial
[43:51] difficulties and I've got health issues
[43:53] and I've got faults and failures and and
[43:56] and relationship issues and job issues
[43:58] and all these things I didn't say you
[44:01] felt free I said you are free and man
[44:04] that's what we forget so many times is
[44:05] that our feelings are determining what
[44:07] we are and it's not based on our
[44:09] feelings it's based on what the word
[44:10] declares for us brother Braham says this
[44:12] he says it's with you tonight
[44:15] unconditionally he's laying it in their
[44:17] lap now he says if you become a
[44:19] Christian every Redemptive blessing of
[44:22] God belongs to
[44:24] you now not not as a group he says it's
[44:28] your personal property you got to put
[44:32] your name there he puts your name there
[44:34] you got to be able to read your name
[44:36] there and realize it's not just for the
[44:37] one that got healed but it's for you
[44:39] it's not for just the one whose children
[44:40] got saved it's for your children that
[44:42] need to get saved it's not for us for
[44:44] that one that got the Holy Ghost it's
[44:45] for you that needs the Holy Ghost amen
[44:47] that everything that he has promised you
[44:49] is your personal property as a son or
[44:52] daughter of God this morning he says you
[44:53] got a right to claim it if you let Satan
[44:56] push you over in the corner well that's
[44:58] up to
[44:59] you he says but brother stand up there
[45:02] toet to Toe with this scripture and say
[45:05] it is written that's right that's the
[45:07] way your Lord did it and any man I don't
[45:09] care you might be a weak
[45:12] Christian you might be a weak Christian
[45:15] this morning he says but you don't need
[45:18] people coming through with gifts of
[45:19] healing you don't need those things the
[45:21] only thing you do too is take God at his
[45:25] word and stand toet to Toe with Satan
[45:28] you'll defeat him on the ground so what
[45:31] he's saying is if you're bound this
[45:32] morning you'll be as bound as you're
[45:34] willing to be bound that it's up to you
[45:36] how much you're willing to go if you
[45:38] think that that that you want to stay
[45:40] there then you can stay there but if you
[45:41] want to get free then you're you can be
[45:43] set free this morning he's already
[45:45] declared it amen you'll stay sick as
[45:47] long as you want you'll stay depressed
[45:48] as long as you want you'll stay
[45:49] overweight as long as you want you'll
[45:51] stay poor as long as you want you'll
[45:53] stay discontented as long as you want
[45:55] but when you say I don't want to be this
[45:57] way anymore now you've got an
[45:59] opportunity to be free but as long as
[46:01] you want it as long as you're willing as
[46:04] long as you allow it as long as you'll
[46:06] deal with it Satan's got room he's got
[46:08] permission to stay there but when you
[46:10] say enough's enough Satan's got to go
[46:13] brother B would say
[46:15] this because what we've got a fountain
[46:18] we've got a fountain this morning and
[46:20] it's a NeverEnding Fountain and it's up
[46:22] to you whether or not you drink you know
[46:24] they got that old saying you you can
[46:25] lead a horse to water but you can't make
[46:27] him drink it's up to you this morning do
[46:29] you want to drink not just do you want
[46:31] to drink how much do you want to drink
[46:33] it's up to you how much you take in this
[46:35] morning brother said there's been much
[46:37] mockery in every phase of religion but
[46:39] there is a real power of the holy spirit
[46:43] that delivers the human being from the
[46:45] bondage of sin he says there's a real
[46:47] power of the holy spirit that delivers
[46:50] the sufferer from his
[46:53] suffering it's not just words it's not
[46:55] just theology it's not just Doctrine but
[46:57] there's a reality in the Holy Ghost
[46:59] that's available for the believer today
[47:01] amen the amazing thing about Believers
[47:03] is we can be in the same situation as
[47:05] somebody next to us and have a
[47:07] completely different Outlook we can have
[47:09] a completely different attitude we can
[47:10] have a completely different approach we
[47:12] can feel different we can act different
[47:14] we can say different even though we're
[47:16] in the exact same condition and it's
[47:18] because we are free that conditions
[47:21] don't determine circumstances don't
[47:22] determine the way that we act the way we
[47:25] think in these different things amen but
[47:27] we all have to walk through life you
[47:28] know brother Hank was telling me while I
[47:30] was away he said brother John he says my
[47:32] life is already on the film It's Already
[47:35] Done God has already determined the way
[47:37] your life goes he said and all I've got
[47:39] to do is walk through it it's already
[47:42] there the film's already there we've
[47:44] said it before that that old Cathedral
[47:46] song I've read the back of the book and
[47:47] we win I've seen the movie we win in the
[47:50] end but you still got to go through the
[47:52] book you still got to go through the
[47:53] movie but if you know the end then you
[47:56] can walk in the middle and you can walk
[47:58] through these hard times with confidence
[48:00] knowing that the end is already
[48:02] determined and we win amen we get our
[48:05] healing we get our deliverance we get
[48:07] our body change we get the Holy Ghost we
[48:09] get salvation we get all of these things
[48:11] that God has promised to the church this
[48:13] morning amen what Freedom means is that
[48:16] none of it can hold us back we're
[48:19] looking to the end we're looking to the
[48:20] author and the finisher of our faith to
[48:22] say you've already declared what's going
[48:24] to happen and so I'm free even though
[48:26] I'm fighting I'm free even though I'm
[48:28] struggling I'm free even though there's
[48:29] a battle I'm free because I know that in
[48:32] the end I'm going to make it all the way
[48:33] through so Satan has no Authority and no
[48:36] power this morning unless we give it to
[48:38] him the only one that controls it is
[48:41] going to be us what are you going to
[48:43] allow what are you going to let him have
[48:45] this morning amen we'll take it to the
[48:47] scriptures as we start to set a
[48:48] foundation before we get into our main
[48:50] thought this
[48:51] morning Jesus is
[48:53] talking and he says then said Jesus
[48:55] Jesus to those Jews which believed on
[48:57] him if ye continue in my word then are
[49:00] ye me my disciples indeed you got to
[49:02] continue you can't just start but you
[49:04] got to keep going you got to keep moving
[49:05] with God he said and you shall know the
[49:07] truth and the truth shall make you free
[49:10] there's a way to be free and it's the
[49:12] truth that does it amen there's a
[49:14] process and we'll see what that looks
[49:15] like in a moment and they answered him
[49:17] the priest answered him and said we be
[49:18] Abraham's seed and were never in bondage
[49:21] to any man how sayest thou ye shall be
[49:24] made free Now Catch because Jesus is
[49:26] offering them freedom and they say we're
[49:29] not
[49:30] bound God can't help you if you don't
[49:33] realize where you're at if you don't
[49:35] think you need help then he can't help
[49:36] you if you don't think you're bound then
[49:38] he can't free you if you don't think
[49:39] you're a slave then he can't take you
[49:41] out of prison you got to recognize where
[49:44] you are this morning amen that's why we
[49:46] call this the house of correction it's
[49:48] to let us see our place by the word and
[49:51] by that same word set us free that's
[49:53] what's going on in the services amen it
[49:55] brings us where we ought to be by the
[49:57] word of God and it says and then Jesus
[49:59] answered them and said verily verily I
[50:01] say unto you whosoever committed sin is
[50:04] a servant of sin what's he saying sin
[50:06] unbelief is the master of everyone until
[50:09] you're set free and it's only Christ can
[50:12] set you free it's only the word of truth
[50:14] that can set you free and whether we
[50:15] realize it or not we're born as slaves
[50:17] and it takes a a real experience with
[50:19] Christ to free us he says the servant
[50:22] abideth not in the house forever but the
[50:24] son abideth forever
[50:25] if the son therefore shall make you free
[50:29] ye shall be free indeed not just a
[50:33] little bit that word indeed means truly
[50:36] in reality certainly it's the real deal
[50:40] he says you'll really be free you think
[50:42] you're free now you'll really be free if
[50:44] you've been set free by the Sun so we
[50:46] know there's an absolute freedom in
[50:48] Christ and it comes by the word of God
[50:49] it comes by the truth of God but it's
[50:51] not by the written word only but it's by
[50:53] the Living Word it's by the power of the
[50:55] Holy spirit in our lives and Jesus would
[50:57] say this a little later in John he says
[50:59] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[51:02] come see he said the spir the truth will
[51:04] set you free then he says when the
[51:06] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[51:09] you into all truth and he will not speak
[51:11] of himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[51:13] that shall he speak and he shall show
[51:15] you things to come Jesus said the spirit
[51:18] the truth shall make you free then he
[51:20] says the spirit of Truth is coming to
[51:22] guide you into all truth and when we put
[51:24] those together we realize that freedom
[51:26] comes not just in word knowledge but in
[51:29] what it's when the word is quickened by
[51:31] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit has to
[51:33] Quicken the word it has to make it alive
[51:36] to set you
[51:37] free because otherwise brother brandham
[51:40] says you say you can you you know I know
[51:42] this and I know that and the Bible he
[51:43] says that just proves you can
[51:45] read that doesn't prove you've got it it
[51:48] doesn't prove you believe it it just
[51:49] proves that you can read but we can
[51:52] study this word and we can read it till
[51:53] we're blue in the face but until God
[51:56] quickens it to us it does us no good
[51:59] it's just head knowledge that's where
[52:00] Saul was until he got converted he had
[52:02] the word completely set up in his life
[52:04] and he was Antichrist at the same time
[52:07] because he needed the Holy Spirit
[52:08] brother Brian would say this he says the
[52:10] word is dead until it's quickened by the
[52:14] spirit we can sit in church and we can
[52:16] hear the preaching of the word and it's
[52:18] good and it'll make us good citizens if
[52:20] we obey it and I'm not against that
[52:22] obviously but until you're filled with
[52:24] the Holy Spirit it doesn't take effect
[52:27] the way it ought to that's just a simple
[52:29] truth that's just the way it is you have
[52:31] to be born again and we know that by
[52:33] experience today Jesus saw it in his day
[52:35] with the priesthood they had tremendous
[52:37] knowledge and understanding and they
[52:38] lived lives that generally speaking to
[52:40] the to the external Observer were
[52:42] perfect that you couldn't put a finger
[52:44] on their life and say they're breaking
[52:46] the law and yet the Living Word comes
[52:48] along and he shows them where their
[52:50] error
[52:51] is and they couldn't see
[52:53] it and they hated him for it and we see
[52:56] it today even as something as simple as
[52:58] water baptism you know to me there's
[53:00] nothing clearer in the scriptures than
[53:02] water baptism in Jesus name and you look
[53:05] at the denominations and they do
[53:06] everything in jesus' name except water
[53:09] baptism you say how can that be how can
[53:12] that be and you show them the scriptures
[53:14] and you line it up and they keep coming
[53:16] back to the titles over and over and
[53:18] over again why they just can't see it
[53:20] because the spirit isn't there to
[53:23] Quicken it it's not their fault it's not
[53:25] their fault they're blinded to it
[53:28] remember what Jesus said to his
[53:29] disciples he said therefore speak I to
[53:32] them in Parables he's talking to about
[53:33] the other people he says because they
[53:35] seeing see not and hearing they hear not
[53:39] neither do they understand and in them
[53:41] is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah
[53:43] which saith by hearing ye shall hear and
[53:45] shall not understand and seeing ye shall
[53:47] see and shall not perceive then he drops
[53:49] to verse 16 he says but blessed are your
[53:52] eyes for they see your eyes work
[53:56] he says and blessed are your ears for
[53:58] they hear I want you to understand what
[54:00] Jesus is saying to the disciples he's
[54:02] saying the people don't understand
[54:04] because it's not given to them to
[54:06] understand it's not meant for them it's
[54:08] only meant for the elect it's only meant
[54:11] for the Sons and Daughters of God he
[54:13] says you're blessed because your eyes
[54:15] see and your ears hear and you
[54:17] understand but let me say something at
[54:19] that moment when he says that they don't
[54:22] understand the thing that he's saying
[54:24] cuz they've said
[54:25] explain to us the
[54:27] parable they have no more understanding
[54:30] than those that are supposedly not
[54:31] blessed he's saying you're blessed but
[54:33] they don't understand the thing but then
[54:35] what happens the spirit of Truth
[54:37] explains to them what's going on and all
[54:40] of a sudden they understand they say
[54:41] that makes total sense What it Took the
[54:44] spirit of Truth in the fullness of
[54:45] godhead bodily in Christ to explain to
[54:48] them what was going on that's the only
[54:51] way we can understand what's going on
[54:53] church is when when he's here when he's
[54:56] in the house when the Holy Spirit is
[54:58] present to Quicken to us his word and
[55:00] what's going on Amen I was talking to
[55:04] with some of the Believers this week not
[55:06] just uh here in newf land but elsewhere
[55:08] and I said I think we've forgotten how
[55:10] good we have it
[55:12] sometimes and I think maybe speaking
[55:15] more to those that have been born into
[55:16] this message we take for granted I think
[55:19] what we know and what we understand
[55:21] because we've always had it and it's
[55:24] always made sense to to us and it's
[55:26] always been in our life but those that
[55:28] have come out from denominations or just
[55:30] come out from the world they understand
[55:32] more what it looks like out there they
[55:34] understand what it's like to be blind to
[55:36] be lost in a way that we don't and now I
[55:38] can pick up my phone and I've got 1,200
[55:40] sermons audio and text perfectly
[55:43] transcribed and I can find anything and
[55:45] do anything with this message that I
[55:49] want and we forget it's the pearl of
[55:51] great
[55:53] price it's a precious Jew jeel worth
[55:56] more than anything else but why do we
[55:58] have it because he has opened our eyes
[56:00] because the spirit of Truth has come to
[56:03] us and we've heard the voice and we've
[56:05] recognized the voice and that's only
[56:07] because he put an antenna in us that
[56:09] could understand it in the first place
[56:10] that could pick up on that thing
[56:13] amen but the easiest thing for us to do
[56:15] and I know I've said this a lot lately
[56:17] and I'm going to keep saying it because
[56:19] I believe it with all my heart the
[56:20] easiest thing for a message believer to
[56:22] do is rest on the intellectual knowledge
[56:24] of this message M and that is death if
[56:26] that's where we stay I'll preach it till
[56:29] I'm dead if all you have is
[56:32] understanding you're lost because you
[56:34] don't understand it the way you do until
[56:36] you get the new
[56:38] birth remember what Paul said he says
[56:40] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[56:43] to think anything as of ourselves but
[56:46] our sufficiency is of God who ha also
[56:50] made us able Ministers of the New
[56:52] Testament not of the letter but of the
[56:55] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[56:58] giveth life amen if we sit here and rest
[57:01] on on God said to prophet and I believe
[57:04] in an end time message and there's a
[57:05] bride that's getting ready and we aren't
[57:07] living in the reality of those things
[57:09] we're going to be very sorely
[57:10] disappointed on Resurrection morning
[57:12] we're going to be sitting there saying
[57:14] but I thought I had it that is not where
[57:17] it ends that's where it starts but it's
[57:19] not where it ends it's got to be a
[57:20] reality in each every one of our Lives I
[57:23] was talking to a minister this we week
[57:25] and and he said we're he travels a lot
[57:27] more obviously than I do and he said
[57:29] we're seeing a global issue of churches
[57:31] dying out he says and it's because
[57:34] they're staying in the past they haven't
[57:37] continued on with God they haven't
[57:39] continued on in the understanding of the
[57:40] message and what happens is they don't
[57:42] transition as the word of God
[57:43] Transitions and the churches die out
[57:45] because they're relics to men and
[57:47] Ministries and the Holy Spirit is not
[57:49] there anymore it's died out because they
[57:51] haven't kept moving on with God and it's
[57:53] killing their churches and and I've seen
[57:55] it myself I know it to be true that
[57:57] we've got to keep moving on as God moves
[57:59] on Amen it's the holy spirit that leads
[58:01] the church it's not we had a pastor for
[58:03] 43 years when he moved aside then the
[58:06] Holy Spirit didn't stop preaching amen
[58:08] and we've had these wonderful men and
[58:09] there many of them have died off there's
[58:11] only a few of those original Witnesses
[58:13] left that's not the leadership of the
[58:15] church the leadership of the church is
[58:17] the Holy Ghost and it moves from vessel
[58:19] to vessel from man to man from Ministry
[58:21] to Ministry People to People child to
[58:24] child It Never Dies it's a living thing
[58:27] amen but we're going to pick up now
[58:29] that's just my Preamble for this morning
[58:31] but we're going to pick up where we left
[58:33] off last service and if you remember we
[58:34] talked about no weapon that is formed
[58:36] against you can prosper and we talked
[58:38] that footsteps is possession and then we
[58:40] talked about how God said fear not time
[58:42] and time again and he said be of good
[58:44] courage don't worry and why did he say
[58:48] that because we are powerful no we just
[58:51] read Paul said our sufficiency is of God
[58:54] we're ins sufficient in ourselves our
[58:56] rest is not in that I am some great
[58:58] thing or I'm some great believer I've
[59:00] got this that or the other our
[59:01] sufficiency is in God remember what God
[59:04] said he said I'm going to go ahead of
[59:05] you and I'm going to fight for you and
[59:07] I'm going to put the fear of God in them
[59:09] and I'm going to put the fear of them in
[59:11] the of you and them he says and then
[59:12] you're going to go and you're going to
[59:13] take over greater and more powerful
[59:15] Nations than yourselves cuz I'm going to
[59:16] fight the victory for you amen we read
[59:19] this quote and it's where where I really
[59:20] want to kick things off this morning
[59:22] where brother Bram said this he said the
[59:23] strength of the Holy Ghost lays in God's
[59:27] promise in other words if we're looking
[59:29] for God to fight on our behalf we've got
[59:31] to find our place in the word of God
[59:33] we've got to find our fight in the word
[59:34] of God we've got to find our
[59:36] circumstances our situation whatever it
[59:38] is our promise we've got to find it in
[59:40] the word of God and we've got to make
[59:42] sure we're on the right side because
[59:44] there's two sides of the word of God
[59:45] there's for and there's against and if
[59:47] you're for then God's for you and if
[59:49] you're against then God's against you
[59:51] God's never for you or against you he's
[59:53] for his word so you you got to be in his
[59:55] word you've got to be on the right side
[59:56] of his word to for him to come on your
[59:58] side amen so we've got to stay within
[1:00:00] the boundaries remember you've got to
[1:00:02] know that you're in a word position and
[1:00:05] how do you do that you find your place
[1:00:07] in the word in Christ in the local body
[1:00:10] you got to find where you're supposed to
[1:00:11] be and what you're supposed to be doing
[1:00:13] and then when you find that you say Lord
[1:00:15] this is my land this is my possession
[1:00:18] this is my property I'm claiming it I'm
[1:00:20] standing on it now you help me to hold
[1:00:22] it and keep it and then God can go to
[1:00:24] work for you amen like I said before if
[1:00:26] you're on Satan's territory you're going
[1:00:28] to lose every single time because you
[1:00:31] have no right outside of the word of God
[1:00:33] that's his land he has kingdoms he has
[1:00:36] positions he has authorities he has
[1:00:37] principalities and they belong to him
[1:00:39] but if it's your land that God has given
[1:00:42] you then you've got a right now if you
[1:00:43] want to go there amen you don't have a
[1:00:45] title deed to Satan's property you got a
[1:00:46] title deed to God's word that's where we
[1:00:49] rest amen now just remember just cuz
[1:00:51] Satan's on it doesn't mean it's his
[1:00:53] property amen CU remember what brother
[1:00:56] BR said he said Satan is a squatter he
[1:00:59] has no right he has no title he has no
[1:01:01] possession but he'll go there and he'll
[1:01:04] set up a fortress he'll build up an Army
[1:01:06] on something that belongs to you and
[1:01:08] what he's hoping is that as you come up
[1:01:10] and you see the castle there that you
[1:01:11] say that doesn't belong to me and you
[1:01:13] move
[1:01:14] on cuz Satan's the ultimate Bluff
[1:01:17] Satan's the ultimate strategist his his
[1:01:19] intention is to make it look harder than
[1:01:21] it really is to make it look like it's
[1:01:24] going to be too much of a battle that
[1:01:26] you can't win it amen but remember God
[1:01:30] said you're going to face greater
[1:01:31] enemies and stronger enemies than
[1:01:33] yourself and you'll defeat them you'll
[1:01:35] take their lands from them because their
[1:01:36] lands belong to
[1:01:38] you now Satan will remind you of the
[1:01:40] part that he's greater than you and
[1:01:43] bigger and mightier because Satan loves
[1:01:45] to quote partial verses Satan never
[1:01:48] likes to give you context or the whole
[1:01:50] thing amen but there where we want to
[1:01:52] see ourselves is in the whole verse
[1:01:54] because remember what Jesus what what
[1:01:56] what Moses said he said then will the
[1:01:59] Lord drive out all these nations from
[1:02:01] before you and ye shall possess greater
[1:02:03] Nations and mightier greater and
[1:02:06] mightier than yourselves so our power is
[1:02:08] not in ourselves it's in God that wins
[1:02:10] the battle amen we're fighting but God
[1:02:12] is the power he's the great champion in
[1:02:14] our midst and we're relying on him all
[1:02:16] the way amen we'll win because what
[1:02:19] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:02:21] that's a greater of than he that's in
[1:02:23] the world it's Christ in me that's
[1:02:25] winning the battle it's not me that's
[1:02:26] winning the battle I fail every
[1:02:28] day when I trust in myself I fail every
[1:02:31] day but when I let him take control then
[1:02:34] that's where the battle's won amen so as
[1:02:36] I mentioned last service I want to talk
[1:02:38] about the Holy Spirit this morning as an
[1:02:40] enforcer in our lives because if we can
[1:02:43] realize that we don't have to win we'll
[1:02:46] relax a bit remember the scripture says
[1:02:49] the battle belongs to God the battle is
[1:02:52] the Lord's so it's not that I have to
[1:02:55] win it's that I have to
[1:02:59] resist resistance is our requirement
[1:03:02] overcoming and victory is God's
[1:03:05] requirement cuz he's the one that's
[1:03:08] overcome he's the one that's got the the
[1:03:11] the keys to death Hell In The Grave
[1:03:12] dangling on his belt tonight today he's
[1:03:15] the one that's already won the battle
[1:03:17] amen scripture says resist the devil and
[1:03:19] he will flee from you but again
[1:03:22] sometimes we focus on the resistance but
[1:03:24] I want to take us back to read that full
[1:03:26] scripture because before comes
[1:03:28] resistance something else has to happen
[1:03:31] amen we don't just resist but if we go
[1:03:33] to the actual scripture it says submit
[1:03:35] yourselves therefore to God then resist
[1:03:39] the devil and he will flee from you
[1:03:41] submission we've got to put ourselves in
[1:03:43] God's hand we've got to find ourselves
[1:03:44] in his word this morning because when we
[1:03:47] get in our way that's when we get
[1:03:49] tempted when we get on our path when we
[1:03:51] get in our will when we get in our
[1:03:53] opinion that's when Satan has access to
[1:03:55] us amen because what we walk out of it
[1:03:58] amen but if we're submitted to God then
[1:04:00] Temptation comes to us we don't go to it
[1:04:03] it's external to us and so we can resist
[1:04:06] because we haven't invited it but
[1:04:08] remember the scripture says that when
[1:04:09] we're says let no man say he's tempted
[1:04:11] of God he says but we're tempted because
[1:04:13] we're drawn aside by our own
[1:04:16] lusts so what happens is when we're not
[1:04:18] submitted to God what are we submitted
[1:04:20] to self and self takes us off the road
[1:04:23] and it gets us into a place where now
[1:04:25] we've walked towards something that
[1:04:27] we're supposed to
[1:04:29] resist now if this is my Temptation and
[1:04:33] I'm in Christ and I'm over here this if
[1:04:35] it happens to walk over here I've got
[1:04:37] every right to say get out of my
[1:04:40] life but if this is my Temptation and I
[1:04:42] go over here and I say get out of my
[1:04:44] life and I'm the one that's walked up to
[1:04:46] it how do you push away something you
[1:04:48] walked up to it didn't come to you you
[1:04:50] came to it the problem's not with the
[1:04:53] Temptation the problems with you so you
[1:04:56] can't resist unless you're submitted to
[1:04:58] God Amen if you've walked towards
[1:05:00] Temptation your Temptation your
[1:05:02] temptation of yourself it's your fault
[1:05:04] that's the reason's there amen so first
[1:05:07] we submit second we resist third Satan
[1:05:11] has to flee that's the way it works
[1:05:13] submission is the first requirement amen
[1:05:16] cuz when we realize that the battle
[1:05:18] belongs to God we realize our role we
[1:05:20] understand it our our position is to
[1:05:23] resist
[1:05:24] his is to provide the power amen ours is
[1:05:28] to surrender his is to provide
[1:05:31] Victory we're letting go and he's doing
[1:05:33] the work amen our Authority is to ask by
[1:05:37] the word and it's his power that
[1:05:38] enforces it by the word we ask and he
[1:05:41] enforces brother Braham says this he
[1:05:43] says we don't have power we got
[1:05:46] Authority it's not a power it's
[1:05:48] Authority we don't need power Christ has
[1:05:51] the power but we've got the authority
[1:05:52] amen there's a a lot of difference he
[1:05:55] was the one who conquered he conquered
[1:05:58] and gave us the authority he's got the
[1:06:00] power but we got the authority just like
[1:06:03] any Ambassador going to another country
[1:06:07] we've got this misconception sometimes
[1:06:09] that we use the Holy Spirit as a power
[1:06:11] church we don't use God that that's like
[1:06:14] your dog using
[1:06:16] you if I could put it that crudely our
[1:06:19] pets don't tell us what to
[1:06:21] do our children don't tell us what to do
[1:06:25] and when they do they find out something
[1:06:26] in a hurry don't they you don't tell
[1:06:28] Mommy and Daddy what to do we don't tell
[1:06:31] God what to do we don't use the Holy
[1:06:34] Spirit the Holy Spirit uses us that's
[1:06:37] the simple truth
[1:06:38] amen it's not how God works he's not
[1:06:41] some sugar daddy and that's what so much
[1:06:43] of Christianity has turned him into is
[1:06:45] you ask and you get you ask and you get
[1:06:47] you ask and you get no you got to find
[1:06:48] your way you got to be submitted you got
[1:06:50] to be surrendered and then you'll start
[1:06:51] to ask the right things and then you'll
[1:06:52] start to receive the right things you
[1:06:54] got to seek the kingdom of God first and
[1:06:56] then you'll start getting the rest God's
[1:06:58] looking for people that are seeking him
[1:07:00] not everything that he provides and then
[1:07:02] seek The Giver of the gift before you
[1:07:04] seek the gifts I would say it that way
[1:07:06] Peter and John didn't use the Holy
[1:07:07] Spirit they were used by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:10] Paul didn't use the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:07:12] Spirit used Paul we've talked about when
[1:07:15] when when Paul was and and Silas were
[1:07:17] being followed by that that girl that
[1:07:19] that fortunetelling girl and for days
[1:07:21] she followed them and she said these are
[1:07:23] the men that show us the way of
[1:07:24] Salvation and day after day it says and
[1:07:27] then Paul being grieved what was he
[1:07:28] grieved by the Holy Spirit was finally
[1:07:30] grieved and then he turned around he
[1:07:32] cast that demon out of her why he was
[1:07:35] used by the Holy Spirit if Paul had
[1:07:37] power of his own he'd cast it out right
[1:07:39] away because we'd say well I don't want
[1:07:41] to deal with that but the Holy Spirit
[1:07:43] used Paul to deliver that girl when it
[1:07:45] was time because guess what she was a
[1:07:47] witness for them for a couple days and
[1:07:49] then he delivered her of that spirit
[1:07:50] that was on her amen we'll we'll see as
[1:07:52] we're going through this that these
[1:07:54] these Apostles and ministers and these
[1:07:56] things they're not using the Holy Spirit
[1:07:58] the holy spirit's using them brother
[1:07:59] brah says my gift is to let myself go
[1:08:03] it's to
[1:08:04] surrender that's what this is about it's
[1:08:06] about surrender not a power because when
[1:08:08] you're yielded God can use you brother
[1:08:10] Hank and I were talking we had a
[1:08:12] wonderful time of fellowship with him
[1:08:13] and sister Verna four and a half hours
[1:08:15] on Thursday and it was just a a
[1:08:16] wonderful time and he was reminded me he
[1:08:18] said that he says you're just a
[1:08:20] microphone until God speaks that's the
[1:08:23] way it's supposed to be you don't speak
[1:08:25] unless he speaks because you're a mute
[1:08:27] instrument unless he's using you I was
[1:08:29] sharing with him some of the testimony
[1:08:30] of some of the past of my life and and
[1:08:32] these different things amen but to an
[1:08:34] outside person it looks like you're
[1:08:35] using power but it's not it's power
[1:08:37] that's using you and that's the way that
[1:08:39] this looks
[1:08:40] amen but remember we have authority so
[1:08:43] brother Braham says here you don't have
[1:08:45] power but you've got Authority and the
[1:08:46] authority comes by the word of God and
[1:08:49] as we move closer into preaching on
[1:08:50] adoption we'll see that God gives you
[1:08:52] authority to match your character
[1:08:54] he gives you authority to match your
[1:08:56] character it's like uh in a business you
[1:08:58] have people that can write checks
[1:08:59] throughout the you know you've got your
[1:09:01] uh your your people on the um accounts
[1:09:03] receivable and accounts payable and
[1:09:05] they've got they can write so much for
[1:09:07] checks on their own and then after a
[1:09:09] certain while they've got to have
[1:09:09] somebody more Superior to them sign off
[1:09:11] on it and you get a big enough amount
[1:09:13] and the CEO has to sign off on it and
[1:09:15] each of us has checks that we can cash
[1:09:16] to certain things but there are certain
[1:09:18] things that every one of us is allowed
[1:09:20] to cash no matter what amen healing is
[1:09:23] in every bank account Deliverance is in
[1:09:26] every bank account provision is in every
[1:09:29] bank account leadership and direction is
[1:09:31] in every bank account we've all got a
[1:09:33] certain level but beyond that God sets
[1:09:35] up levels of authority and it's based on
[1:09:38] what our character and when you find
[1:09:40] your place in the word and in the body
[1:09:41] of Christ then you'll find the authority
[1:09:43] that's God's granted to you now when
[1:09:45] brother Bradon would speak on this
[1:09:46] thought on the enforcer as the holy the
[1:09:48] Holy Spirit as an enforcer he only does
[1:09:50] it in one message out of all 1,200 odd
[1:09:53] that he does there's only one message
[1:09:54] and it's in the message the restoration
[1:09:57] of the brid tree it's the only place he
[1:09:59] talks about the Holy Spirit as an
[1:10:00] enforcer so we'll see it perhaps a
[1:10:02] little different as we thought now we
[1:10:03] say what's an enforcer now the original
[1:10:06] enforcer was in the mafia or the gangs
[1:10:08] where they had these men with with big
[1:10:10] muscles and big bodies and not often a
[1:10:13] lot of intelligence and and I looked one
[1:10:15] up and and this is a modern day enforcer
[1:10:17] you know in in New York or Chicago they
[1:10:19] had these guys and they go and they make
[1:10:21] sure that that people did what they were
[1:10:23] told to do and if you didn't do what
[1:10:24] they told you to do then they tuned you
[1:10:26] up with a beating or they beat up your
[1:10:28] business or they drove your customers
[1:10:29] away they beat up your property they
[1:10:31] gave your family a hard time whatever it
[1:10:33] was so they were there to enforce the
[1:10:35] wrong side of the law they were goons
[1:10:38] they were Thugs and then of course those
[1:10:40] of you that play hockey you know that
[1:10:42] there was a role of an enforcer there
[1:10:43] and guys like Bob Probert here and what
[1:10:46] happened is if you touched the star
[1:10:48] player then they come over and they beat
[1:10:49] you up now they take a penalty for it
[1:10:52] but the goal was to make make it so that
[1:10:54] their best players their star players
[1:10:56] could have more freedom on the ice that
[1:10:58] you weren't hacking and chopping and
[1:10:59] body checking them and doing these
[1:11:01] things even though some of those things
[1:11:02] are legal but they wanted to keep their
[1:11:04] star players free so that they could
[1:11:05] score goals and win games and so if you
[1:11:07] if you touch them then they said you
[1:11:09] touch him you got to deal with me and
[1:11:11] they'd fight you whether you wanted to
[1:11:12] or not they were an enforcer now that's
[1:11:14] gone mostly out of the game today
[1:11:15] because the game's so quick you can't
[1:11:17] have a guy that's just a goon out there
[1:11:18] because they'll score goals all day on
[1:11:19] him so that's moved out of the way but
[1:11:21] when brother bradam starts to talk about
[1:11:23] it these are two illegals if I could put
[1:11:25] it that way they're on the wrong side of
[1:11:27] the law they're not on the side of right
[1:11:28] they're on the on the side of wrong but
[1:11:30] when brother brandham talks about it he
[1:11:32] puts him on the right side of the law
[1:11:34] side of the law and he puts him in
[1:11:35] alignment with the word of God and he
[1:11:37] says he's a Lawman he's like a sheriff
[1:11:40] he's like a police officer he says
[1:11:42] that's what the holy spirit is is he's
[1:11:43] an officer of the law to enforce the
[1:11:46] word of God in your life and in your
[1:11:48] situation now here's what he would say
[1:11:50] so we're going to go into just a few
[1:11:51] quotes on this for a bit he says to
[1:11:53] restore means to return to the former
[1:11:56] owner or to bring back to the former
[1:11:58] state of condition he says and we can
[1:12:01] enforce a claim to be
[1:12:04] restored he says and if a claim is made
[1:12:07] on something to make that restoration
[1:12:09] you can enforce it to make it come back
[1:12:12] to its right place so in other words
[1:12:14] there's a purpose behind this enforcer
[1:12:16] of the Holy Spirit and it's to bring you
[1:12:19] back to Restoration it's to restore you
[1:12:22] the the Holy Spirit say not just running
[1:12:24] around willy-nilly doing whatever we ask
[1:12:26] but he's there to enforce a restoration
[1:12:29] of the Bride to her original condition
[1:12:32] amen so if you're in the Plan of
[1:12:34] Redemption if you're in the plan of
[1:12:35] restoration then you've got an enforcer
[1:12:37] on your side you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:12:39] on your side amen and he's going to
[1:12:40] bring you all the way and he's going to
[1:12:42] knock down everything that stands in
[1:12:43] front of you brother bam says he
[1:12:46] continues he says to restore means to
[1:12:48] bring back or to restore a claim can uh
[1:12:53] a claim can be enforced now to bring
[1:12:55] anything back to its rightful owner
[1:12:57] where it belongs therefore some way it
[1:12:59] went away from its rightful owner and
[1:13:01] can wander around anywhere but to
[1:13:03] restore is to bring it back to who
[1:13:06] really owns it or to bring it back to
[1:13:08] its natural estate where it was at the
[1:13:11] first time bring it back to its natural
[1:13:15] condition he said that in order to do
[1:13:17] this we have a right to enforce if
[1:13:19] there's a law to enforce this rightful
[1:13:22] condition of restoration to restore he
[1:13:25] says look if somebody stole some
[1:13:27] property and they're holding the
[1:13:28] property captive then you can take the
[1:13:31] law and go to this person and the law
[1:13:33] forces it enforces this person to
[1:13:36] restore this property back to its
[1:13:38] natural owner to its liable First Estate
[1:13:43] so now brother BR starting to narrow the
[1:13:45] focus of the Holy Spirit as an enforcer
[1:13:47] here because it's to bring us back to
[1:13:49] our Natural State now let me say this if
[1:13:52] you're a child of heav hell you're in
[1:13:54] your natural state nothing's going to
[1:13:56] change but if you're a child of God
[1:13:58] we're not in our natural state right now
[1:14:01] there's nothing natural there's nothing
[1:14:03] original about the state that we're in
[1:14:05] this morning amen so the holy spirit is
[1:14:08] here because he's not out there just to
[1:14:10] do whatever we ask or want but he's
[1:14:12] there to enforce a restoration of the
[1:14:15] brid tree he's there to enforce the
[1:14:17] restoration of the authority of the word
[1:14:19] in our lives and in the property of God
[1:14:22] that's what he's there for
[1:14:24] what is our natural position in
[1:14:26] fellowship with
[1:14:28] Christ that's our natural position so
[1:14:30] the focus of the holy spirit is to
[1:14:32] restore us to relationship with Christ
[1:14:35] as it was in the beginning as Adam and
[1:14:36] Eve had it at it in the Garden of Eden
[1:14:40] brother Braham says brother if God gave
[1:14:42] an Eagle wings to take him from danger
[1:14:44] to safety and as long as he could feel
[1:14:46] those wings operating right what
[1:14:48] difference did it make what kind of a
[1:14:50] danger he was in remember he's talking
[1:14:53] about that that eagle and he he went and
[1:14:54] he he shot he pointed the rifle at the
[1:14:56] eagle and he said you know I could just
[1:14:57] shoot you he said that eagle just looked
[1:14:59] at me and then just went and he was gone
[1:15:01] he said and I couldn't couldn't have got
[1:15:02] him first nor last he said he wasn't
[1:15:05] worried because why he had wings that
[1:15:08] worked now he says but what ought a man
[1:15:10] to do with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:13] when he feels the spirit of God
[1:15:15] operating
[1:15:17] right catch this now operating right
[1:15:21] blessing him and giv giving him the deep
[1:15:24] deep things that he desires and the love
[1:15:26] that he desires of God brother what are
[1:15:28] you praying for for the Holy Ghost to do
[1:15:30] in your life to Fellowship to walk with
[1:15:35] him amen what can the devil put before
[1:15:38] you God's or Paul said oh death where's
[1:15:40] your sting grave where's your Victory
[1:15:42] but thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:15:44] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:46] even death in the grave could not
[1:15:47] nothing could like scare that old
[1:15:49] Apostle he knew that he had fellowship
[1:15:52] with Christ but he said what is he
[1:15:53] looking for he says when the spirit of
[1:15:55] God is operating in you to do what to
[1:15:58] bring you to Fellowship to walk with God
[1:16:01] we read the scripture a few verses ago
[1:16:03] seek ye first the kingdom of God what
[1:16:07] seek restoration to your position in
[1:16:09] Christ and everything else you have need
[1:16:11] of will be added but see the thing is we
[1:16:14] want the Holy Spirit to add all of these
[1:16:16] things and we're not so worried about
[1:16:17] our relationship being restored with
[1:16:19] Christ Focus On Christ first focus on
[1:16:22] getting back in relation with him focus
[1:16:24] on getting close to him and you'll start
[1:16:26] to see those other things start to fall
[1:16:28] into line amen we're not here seeking
[1:16:30] power and authority for the Natural
[1:16:32] Things of life and for uh positions or
[1:16:35] manifestations in ourselves for our
[1:16:37] natural blessings that's not what the
[1:16:39] Holy Spirit was meant for amen but we're
[1:16:41] walking the highway to Heaven and the
[1:16:43] holy spirit's here to take us all the
[1:16:45] way through Amen to give us our freedom
[1:16:47] as we walk that path that we can go all
[1:16:49] the way back to Christ amen he's in our
[1:16:52] lives to to bring us back to our
[1:16:53] original condition not to make this one
[1:16:56] more palatable but to take us out of it
[1:16:59] we're pilgrims and strangers here today
[1:17:01] this is not our home this is not our
[1:17:04] rest this is not our peace this is not
[1:17:06] our final place our final condition
[1:17:07] we're getting out of here and the holy
[1:17:09] spirit's here to take us to where we're
[1:17:11] going amen what do we have in our
[1:17:13] original condition we have relationship
[1:17:15] with Christ we had eternal life and we
[1:17:17] had total
[1:17:18] Dominion the first thing he's restoring
[1:17:20] back is
[1:17:21] relationship that gives us a turn life
[1:17:24] and that'll bring us to Total Dominion
[1:17:26] the total Dominion comes later church we
[1:17:29] don't have total Dominion here we don't
[1:17:32] cuz God's got to burn it all God's got
[1:17:33] to destroy it all but what you'll find
[1:17:36] is the total Dominion happens here in
[1:17:38] this body we've got and once he's got
[1:17:41] that Soul sealed like we talk about now
[1:17:43] he starts to take dominion over the Mind
[1:17:45] Over the spirit and over the body and
[1:17:48] that's why the body is the last thing to
[1:17:49] be changed because that's the last place
[1:17:51] of total dominion and that's when our
[1:17:53] bodies changed into a glorious body like
[1:17:54] his and we go into a resurrection we go
[1:17:57] in a Rapture amen that's what he's doing
[1:18:00] so the focus of the holy spirit is not
[1:18:02] to change around us it's to change us
[1:18:04] first and then when you're changed now
[1:18:07] he can start to use you for the the good
[1:18:09] of the kingdom of God and the good of
[1:18:11] others brother BR says enforce he says
[1:18:14] then we have the privilege to enforce
[1:18:18] listen a privilege is granted not
[1:18:21] everyone has privilege in certain
[1:18:24] things not everyone has what you have he
[1:18:27] says we're given the privilege to
[1:18:29] enforce upon Satan the claims that God
[1:18:32] give us for God has a law and his word
[1:18:35] is a law and God in this word made
[1:18:38] certain claims to the church therefore
[1:18:40] we have a right to force these claims
[1:18:44] upon Satan and say give it back and he
[1:18:48] has to do it he says because we can take
[1:18:51] God's agent the holy spirit and go right
[1:18:54] on down on our knees and say it's thus
[1:18:57] sayith the Lord he's got to give it up
[1:18:59] that's all cuz the holy spirit is there
[1:19:02] to make him do it he says the law of the
[1:19:05] land is to enforce without enforcement
[1:19:08] the law means
[1:19:10] nothing he says but the law of the
[1:19:13] spirit of God is to force Satan to give
[1:19:15] up that which he has unrightfully and
[1:19:18] deceitfully taken from God Souls of men
[1:19:21] he took from God Souls of women children
[1:19:23] sickness of the body he placed upon
[1:19:25] people where God Made Them In His Image
[1:19:27] to be like him and the church has given
[1:19:29] the rightful legal rights by the Bible
[1:19:32] to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[1:19:35] upon him now I want to stop here for a
[1:19:38] second because notice what he said he
[1:19:41] said what Satan has unrightfully and
[1:19:43] deceitfully taken if you give it to
[1:19:45] Satan if you open the door to Satan if
[1:19:48] you agree that Satan can have anything
[1:19:50] then he's got a right to be there when
[1:19:52] you let let him do it then he has a
[1:19:54] right to be there if you love that
[1:19:55] Spirit if you love that habit if you
[1:19:57] love that condition if you love that
[1:19:59] relationship if you love that hidden
[1:20:00] thing in your life then he can stay
[1:20:02] there as long as you love
[1:20:06] it it'll be there as long as you want it
[1:20:08] to be there amen if you got knowledge of
[1:20:12] the truth and you turn it aside because
[1:20:14] you love that thing more Satan has a
[1:20:16] right to be in your life and until you
[1:20:18] find the love of God greater than the
[1:20:20] love of that it'll stay there but if one
[1:20:22] day you get the love of God in your life
[1:20:23] in a greater way it'll kick that thing
[1:20:25] right out of your life CU it can't stay
[1:20:27] in the presence of the Holy Ghost in
[1:20:28] your life amen you'll make a choice one
[1:20:32] day that's what it'll be and you'll say
[1:20:34] I don't like this anymore and it'll go
[1:20:37] Paul said in Romans he said neither
[1:20:39] yield ye your members your natural
[1:20:41] faculties and
[1:20:43] body don't give any of this as
[1:20:46] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[1:20:48] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[1:20:50] that are alive from the dead your you're
[1:20:52] dead and Christ lives in you now he says
[1:20:55] as those that are alive from the dead
[1:20:57] and your members as instruments of
[1:20:58] righteousness unto God brother BR says
[1:21:01] listen destroy your enemy before your
[1:21:03] enemy destroys
[1:21:05] you he'll do it bring back the
[1:21:07] oldfashioned meetings and the thing and
[1:21:09] leave Delilah alone leave the world
[1:21:13] alone that thing that Woos you off into
[1:21:16] little things that you shouldn't and
[1:21:18] little things troubles come up in the
[1:21:20] church and you won't stand correction
[1:21:22] because you don't have to you can drop
[1:21:23] off to another church and things like
[1:21:25] that he said in the early days when a
[1:21:27] man didn't cope up with the word of God
[1:21:29] they packed him out
[1:21:30] dead bring us back to Pentecost he said
[1:21:33] not Hollywood Showmanship but a
[1:21:35] wholehearted turn to God is what we need
[1:21:37] once more oh Lord once more Church you
[1:21:41] know your own lives I know my own life
[1:21:43] and I may not have a Delila like Samson
[1:21:45] did but we've all got things that can
[1:21:47] seduce
[1:21:48] us Delilah didn't come along for 20
[1:21:51] years in Samson's life
[1:21:53] you know the the scripture is funny that
[1:21:55] way it it'll skip over long periods of
[1:21:57] time as if nothing happened cuz you
[1:22:00] remember Samson had issues with
[1:22:03] women how did he get issues with
[1:22:06] women by walking around the Philistine
[1:22:10] Landes he got out of where he was
[1:22:12] supposed to be and he got into the world
[1:22:15] and all of a sudden he started seeing
[1:22:16] pretty women and he had a real problem
[1:22:19] with pretty women and it led him to
[1:22:21] problems over and over again
[1:22:23] but then he got away from pretty women
[1:22:26] in the land of philistia and for 20
[1:22:29] years he judged Israel
[1:22:32] perfectly and then the scripture comes
[1:22:34] and it says and and Samson found a woman
[1:22:36] named Delilah in the valley of
[1:22:38] sork and all of a sudden Samson realizes
[1:22:42] he didn't conquer that it was still an
[1:22:45] issue do you know where the valley of
[1:22:47] Sorak is it's right on the border of
[1:22:52] Israel and
[1:22:53] fisa how did Sam how did Samson get into
[1:22:56] trouble he got over on the border he got
[1:23:00] over on the
[1:23:03] edge he started looking in a land that
[1:23:05] he hadn't conquered he started looking
[1:23:08] at a world that he wasn't supposed to be
[1:23:09] a part of and pretty soon he was right
[1:23:12] there in the middle of it and the thing
[1:23:14] that he had conquered conquered him
[1:23:17] because he got out of his place he got
[1:23:20] out of his position what's a judge doing
[1:23:22] looking in the land of fisa he had no
[1:23:25] place he had no right he had no purpose
[1:23:27] of being there he got LED astray by his
[1:23:29] own curiosity and by his own lusts amen
[1:23:32] but I like how brother Bram said that
[1:23:34] thing that Woos you into little things
[1:23:37] that you shouldn't scripture says it's
[1:23:39] the little foxes that spoil the vine and
[1:23:42] sometimes it's the little things that
[1:23:43] cause us the biggest grief because they
[1:23:45] seem little but they have a big
[1:23:48] effect cuz they nip the life out of us
[1:23:51] and they cause the fruit to to wither
[1:23:52] and they cause the leaves to wither it's
[1:23:54] the little things that can cause those
[1:23:56] problems amen feel like we've lost the
[1:23:59] victory it's not big things often in the
[1:24:01] lives of Believers it's the little
[1:24:02] things that keep dragging us down
[1:24:04] sometimes the problem is we keep
[1:24:05] injecting ourselves into
[1:24:07] situations it's a lesson I've had to
[1:24:09] learn the hard way God does all things
[1:24:12] perfectly and then I get involved and
[1:24:13] they go not so
[1:24:15] perfectly sometimes it's the little me
[1:24:17] that keeps trying to get into things
[1:24:19] that God's already handling on his
[1:24:21] own what's brother BR saying get away
[1:24:23] from it cut its head off leave
[1:24:27] it and once you've left it don't go back
[1:24:29] to it don't go looking over there that's
[1:24:31] your past that's your past and you have
[1:24:34] no point in being around that leave it
[1:24:37] alone leave her alone whatever it
[1:24:41] is you know sometimes we
[1:24:44] pretend I've got it under control if
[1:24:47] it's in your life it's got control if
[1:24:50] it's in your life it has control
[1:24:53] because if it's an Unholy thing the Holy
[1:24:55] Spirit won't let it stay there it's got
[1:24:57] control don't let him fool you I've got
[1:25:01] it under control no if it's still there
[1:25:02] and it's an Unholy thing Satan has
[1:25:04] control get away from the edge don't
[1:25:05] play with the fire but if you're a
[1:25:08] sincere believer and Satan's trying to
[1:25:09] put something in your life you don't
[1:25:11] have to deal with it you have a right to
[1:25:14] enforce a claim amen anything that would
[1:25:17] keep you from being restored back to
[1:25:19] your natural position in Christ you've
[1:25:21] got a law that you can send out for
[1:25:23] enforcement brother brah says and if
[1:25:25] Satan has robbed you of the privilege of
[1:25:26] being a son or a daughter of God we have
[1:25:29] a right this morning by the Holy Spirit
[1:25:30] to enforce the claim of God bring them
[1:25:35] back he says if he's Afflicted you and
[1:25:37] made you sick we have a right before God
[1:25:39] to enforce the laws of God by his
[1:25:41] stripes we are healed amen bring him
[1:25:44] back turn him loose you're taking him
[1:25:45] out yonder of death and we claim him
[1:25:48] bring him back now he says that's the
[1:25:50] enforcement restore it back back to its
[1:25:52] natural condition again if there was
[1:25:56] never a before there can't be an again
[1:25:58] if you didn't already have it you can't
[1:26:00] have it now but he says because you had
[1:26:03] it you can have it because you were
[1:26:06] perfect you can be perfect because you
[1:26:08] were healthy you can be healthy because
[1:26:11] you did have a sound mind you can have a
[1:26:13] sound mind because you did have peace
[1:26:15] you have peace because you did have joy
[1:26:17] you can have
[1:26:18] joy you can have it because it was
[1:26:21] always yours it always belongs to you
[1:26:22] amen as a child of God it's because you
[1:26:24] were then that you can have it now today
[1:26:27] he says and a man is sick a baby is sick
[1:26:29] a woman is sick see they're out of their
[1:26:31] natural condition then we have a right
[1:26:33] to enforce our claim they say it's not
[1:26:36] our claim it's our claim because God
[1:26:38] give it to us he says by his stripes we
[1:26:41] were healed he was wounded for our
[1:26:43] transgression with his stripes we were
[1:26:44] healed now we have a right to enforce
[1:26:47] that law and the lawgiver the Holy
[1:26:49] Spirit himself is here the agent of God
[1:26:52] to see that it's done that way amen now
[1:26:55] the only way he can
[1:26:57] work catch this this is my Bolding it
[1:27:01] here the only way he can work is when
[1:27:04] you let him
[1:27:05] work he says see you've got to believe
[1:27:09] it there's a law so we do have a part to
[1:27:13] play we do have something we have to do
[1:27:15] and he says we can't just desire it we
[1:27:19] can't just like it we can't just speak
[1:27:22] it he says we've got to believe it
[1:27:25] that's our part to play is we've got to
[1:27:26] believe that healing isn't just for that
[1:27:28] brother or that sister or salvation or
[1:27:31] the holy ghost or Deliverance whatever
[1:27:33] it might be you got to believe that it's
[1:27:35] for you you've got to put your name in
[1:27:37] that scripture amen we've got to believe
[1:27:39] it and our belief is expressed in our
[1:27:42] actions James said faith without works
[1:27:44] is dead amen how we Act is going to show
[1:27:48] what we believe not just what we say
[1:27:50] brother Bram says you need the holy
[1:27:52] ghost to press out there in other words
[1:27:54] don't try this on your own he says Satan
[1:27:57] knows that reasoning and what reasoning
[1:27:59] where reasoning lays yes sir to be an
[1:28:01] effectual witness of his resurrection he
[1:28:03] knew it would take the Holy Ghost cuz
[1:28:04] man cannot do those things he equipped
[1:28:07] his army with the Holy Ghost to do those
[1:28:08] things to make known the secrets of the
[1:28:10] heart as he promised you can't do that
[1:28:12] with any kind of training you've got to
[1:28:14] do that by the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:16] Spirit the armor of God and this is the
[1:28:19] evening light to make Hebrews 138
[1:28:21] reality he says it would take more than
[1:28:23] a training you can't be Jesus Christ the
[1:28:26] same yesterday today and forever by
[1:28:27] training he says you got to get the Holy
[1:28:30] Ghost he says you can read words and
[1:28:33] read words and read words and it'll
[1:28:36] never make it come to pass until you
[1:28:37] have the Holy Ghost there to manifest
[1:28:39] that that's the light he says putting on
[1:28:41] the whole armor of God not just a dress
[1:28:44] only dress up and say glory to God I got
[1:28:45] the Holy Ghost he says then you're
[1:28:47] spurting all the power out the whistle
[1:28:49] you're doing no good put it in action
[1:28:52] put it in faith make it move make it do
[1:28:55] something putting on the whole armor of
[1:28:57] God to go out and withstand the Ws of
[1:28:59] the devil he says let the mind of Christ
[1:29:02] that was in let the mind that was in
[1:29:04] Christ be in you he said takes the
[1:29:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost the whole
[1:29:08] armor of God not just to shake hands
[1:29:10] with a preacher put your name on the
[1:29:12] book or take some kosher and swallow it
[1:29:14] and a priest drink up the wine that
[1:29:16] isn't it but Brothers stay there until
[1:29:19] there comes a rushing Mighty Wind that
[1:29:21] fills all your being takes all your
[1:29:23] doubts out takes all your Creeds out
[1:29:26] takes everything else out and puts the
[1:29:28] word in there with the power of God
[1:29:30] behind it to back it up he says brother
[1:29:32] the whole armor of God is the baptism of
[1:29:35] the Holy Ghost with the word behind it
[1:29:39] the whole purpose of this message is to
[1:29:42] restore the True Church of God back to
[1:29:44] the leadership of the Holy Spirit just
[1:29:47] as it was in the book of Acts except
[1:29:48] this time it'll take us into
[1:29:50] resurrection and Rapture it'll take us
[1:29:51] us all the way it was supposed to
[1:29:54] go that's the purpose but before we can
[1:29:57] have that we've got to have the first
[1:29:59] fruits we've got to have a taste before
[1:30:01] we can get the full thing brother Brown
[1:30:04] would say that healing is a down payment
[1:30:07] of the resurrection of the body change
[1:30:11] the Holy Ghost is the down payment of
[1:30:13] your full salvation you get a taste of
[1:30:16] the victory before you get the full
[1:30:17] Victory you get a first fruit before you
[1:30:19] get the whole Harvest and so he say says
[1:30:22] you got a right to claim these things he
[1:30:24] says while it's taking you in the path
[1:30:26] to get you to the full meal deal and
[1:30:28] then we get a portion before we get the
[1:30:29] whole thing brother Bram says now we
[1:30:32] have a law the law of the life in US you
[1:30:35] are made and born and placed here in the
[1:30:38] body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of
[1:30:40] God you don't have to knuckle down to
[1:30:42] the devil we've got a law and that's the
[1:30:45] law the Holy
[1:30:47] Spirit now he said last time he says the
[1:30:49] only thing you have to do is believe he
[1:30:51] says the only thing you you have to do
[1:30:52] is know how to let go and let
[1:30:55] God you keep fighting at it see and it
[1:30:57] won't never work when you let go and let
[1:31:00] God that's all see remember submit
[1:31:03] yourselves to God resist the devil and
[1:31:05] he will flee from you it's the surrender
[1:31:07] that's the key
[1:31:09] part let him go to working we say oh
[1:31:12] when I come into full maturity I'm going
[1:31:14] to do so and so when I'm adopted I'm
[1:31:16] going to have spoken word authority and
[1:31:17] I'm going to do this and I'm no no you
[1:31:19] won't that's about you
[1:31:23] you got to defeat
[1:31:24] you and if everything you're talking
[1:31:26] about is in the future you'll be so
[1:31:28] caught up you can't defeat the present
[1:31:30] if everything is in the future then
[1:31:32] what's going on
[1:31:33] now you won't have a future if there's
[1:31:35] nothing happening in the present because
[1:31:38] the spirit is Alive and Well to work in
[1:31:39] us today amen with an attitude of II we
[1:31:42] won't defeat our own self much less
[1:31:44] Satan the first victory's got to be
[1:31:46] inside of us amen but when you come into
[1:31:49] full maturity you'll be so completely
[1:31:51] convinced that you can't do a thing that
[1:31:53] God will have full preeminence in your
[1:31:55] life and you'll know because you'd have
[1:31:58] tried you'd have tried to do it in
[1:32:00] yourself you to try to do it your way
[1:32:01] and you've seen what comes out of it and
[1:32:03] so you say Lord I'm going to trust you
[1:32:05] all the way on this I'm not going to
[1:32:06] even stick my finger in the water to
[1:32:08] help us along on this boat of life I'm
[1:32:11] just going to keep all of myself inside
[1:32:13] here and we're going to get let you take
[1:32:14] care of this
[1:32:16] journey and you'll speak when he tells
[1:32:18] you to speak you'll be quiet when he
[1:32:20] tells you to be quiet you you'll act
[1:32:22] when he tells you to act you'll pray how
[1:32:24] he tells you to pray you'll move how he
[1:32:26] tells you to move on a daily basis
[1:32:28] because it'll be Christ in you that's
[1:32:30] operating amen and we'll be dead to
[1:32:32] ourselves I have to die so that he can
[1:32:35] have the preeminence and that's a daily
[1:32:37] thing Paul said I've noticed the closer
[1:32:40] we get to God the less we talk about
[1:32:42] ourselves I've met some tremendous
[1:32:44] tremendous Believers in my life and I'll
[1:32:46] tell you the greatest Believers you
[1:32:48] can't barely pull a thing out about
[1:32:50] themselves but I'll tell you they'll
[1:32:52] brag on God and they'll testify of the
[1:32:54] good things of God but they won't talk
[1:32:55] about themselves cuz they've learned
[1:32:57] that it's Christ in them that is the
[1:32:58] great Overcomer
[1:33:01] Amen brother said if the fish said wait
[1:33:03] I'll catch my breath real good I'll
[1:33:05] breathe up a little oxygen in me and
[1:33:07] I'll see if I can go down he's talking
[1:33:08] about letting go he says no if he does
[1:33:10] that he'll burst open see the bird says
[1:33:13] I'll see how fast I can run down here
[1:33:14] and maybe I'll take off no he won't do
[1:33:16] it he'll fall down see he's got to know
[1:33:18] how that law can control him and the
[1:33:20] same way it is with it isn't what we
[1:33:22] fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I
[1:33:24] don't get this if I don't get that
[1:33:26] that's not it it is to know that the law
[1:33:28] of life is in
[1:33:32] you he says and you just let go and let
[1:33:36] God then he takes you to your healing
[1:33:38] takes you to the baptism of the spirit
[1:33:40] or anything that he's promised any claim
[1:33:43] that he's given is yours and by letting
[1:33:46] go and letting
[1:33:48] God that's why I said we can relax
[1:33:52] when we realize the battle is not ours
[1:33:55] the greatest battle is to let go to
[1:33:57] trust to believe and to act in faith and
[1:34:01] then the battle is the holy spirits but
[1:34:04] notice he says the law of the life is
[1:34:06] where in
[1:34:07] you you've got to know you've got the
[1:34:09] Holy Ghost you got to know you've got
[1:34:12] the Holy Ghost I'm going to say it again
[1:34:14] you've got to know you've got the Holy
[1:34:16] Ghost because if you don't you can have
[1:34:17] no
[1:34:18] confidence no confidence cuz if you
[1:34:21] don't believe you got the Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] then where's the
[1:34:24] enforcer who are
[1:34:26] you cuz a child of God will have the
[1:34:28] Holy Ghost eventually you got to know
[1:34:32] youve got
[1:34:33] it he says that's the reason the law of
[1:34:35] life that was in Christ when the word
[1:34:37] was spoken and said I'll not suffer my
[1:34:39] Holy One to see corruption neither will
[1:34:41] I leave his soul in Hell there wasn't
[1:34:43] enough time there wasn't enough Devils
[1:34:46] there wasn't enough anything to keep
[1:34:48] Christ in that grave till his body begin
[1:34:49] to rot because the law of God will bring
[1:34:52] the word to pass he says and the law of
[1:34:55] God by the Holy Spirit brings any
[1:34:57] promise to pass regardless of the
[1:35:02] conditions now I want you to catch we're
[1:35:04] going to start to close here brother bam
[1:35:06] focuses on this he says job said though
[1:35:08] the skin worms destroy my body yet in my
[1:35:10] flesh I'll see God church this is the
[1:35:13] meat of this service regardless of how
[1:35:16] little we
[1:35:18] are how low we are
[1:35:22] how impure we are how Unholy we are how
[1:35:28] sick we are how Afflicted we
[1:35:32] are does that include us all this
[1:35:35] morning low little impure Unholy sick or
[1:35:40] Afflicted what he's saying is it don't
[1:35:42] matter where you're at he says the law
[1:35:45] of God's spirit by his word makes it
[1:35:48] obey him forces the issue and says give
[1:35:51] it back he says amen oh if we could just
[1:35:55] think of that for a minute forces it
[1:35:57] regardless of conditions no matter what
[1:35:59] the condition is the law of God's word
[1:36:01] forces a condition to cope with his word
[1:36:03] see it's got to church that gives me
[1:36:05] hope this morning that gives me courage
[1:36:07] this morning that gives me Faith this
[1:36:08] morning that gives me a hunger and an
[1:36:10] expectation this morning that my
[1:36:12] condition will not hold back the word of
[1:36:14] God my failures my flaws my my my faults
[1:36:18] whatever it might be my my own idea of
[1:36:23] myself my own disappointment in
[1:36:26] myself won't hold back the word of God
[1:36:30] it has nothing to do with it not a thing
[1:36:33] to do with it anyone feeling low this
[1:36:37] morning anyone feeling sick this morning
[1:36:41] anyone feeling impure or Unholy this
[1:36:43] morning anybody think you're nothing
[1:36:45] this
[1:36:46] morning don't put up your
[1:36:50] hands you probably wouldn't because
[1:36:52] you're feeling too
[1:36:54] little this is for
[1:36:57] you it's for all of us amen we've all
[1:37:01] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:37:02] God but he says
[1:37:05] nothing no condition he says well hold
[1:37:08] it back the word of God forces the
[1:37:11] condition to cope with his word the
[1:37:14] first place it does is in me and in you
[1:37:17] forget the external the internal is the
[1:37:20] first victory
[1:37:22] this body of Flesh this mind this spirit
[1:37:24] this Soul that's the first place of
[1:37:26] Victory then he starts to move outside
[1:37:28] of those things before he can use you
[1:37:30] he's got to bring you and your being
[1:37:32] subject to him and then he can start to
[1:37:34] use you for the outside benefit amen
[1:37:35] once he's got your soul sealed then he's
[1:37:37] moving in on your mind and your spirit
[1:37:39] and your body to restore them back to
[1:37:41] their natural condition and as you grow
[1:37:43] in Christ now he can start to use you
[1:37:45] amen I'm glad I can't hold him back this
[1:37:47] morning I'm glad that he's pushing him
[1:37:48] forward regardless that he's not looking
[1:37:51] at this condition that's why we have the
[1:37:52] blood so that he doesn't see the
[1:37:55] condition in a sinful way just in a
[1:37:58] needful
[1:38:00] way and he's just restoring us back to
[1:38:02] what he saw amen and any obstacle he's
[1:38:06] bringing it subject to the law of his
[1:38:08] word to move it out of the way he says
[1:38:11] then the law of God has to work by that
[1:38:14] word he says we're coming down to a
[1:38:16] great thing in a minute where the law of
[1:38:18] God's word the law of God is with his
[1:38:20] word now the court writes out a word
[1:38:22] it's a certain certain thing and a
[1:38:23] penalty to do so and so all right now
[1:38:25] that's the word of the court and the law
[1:38:27] of the Court enforces the word of the
[1:38:29] court and God speaks something and that
[1:38:32] is a law and the Holy Spirit is here to
[1:38:34] enforce that law amen for the believer
[1:38:37] now watch this he says you have to be
[1:38:38] ordained to do it and it takes a
[1:38:42] Believer remember those things that are
[1:38:45] to those that
[1:38:47] believe he says you got to have
[1:38:52] the badge of believer somebody says you
[1:38:54] got power no but we got Authority that's
[1:38:57] it not power but Authority we ain't got
[1:39:00] enough power to do nothing church let me
[1:39:02] ask you are we Believers this morning
[1:39:04] are we Believers this morning if you're
[1:39:06] a Believer we're talking to
[1:39:09] you we're talking to you this morning
[1:39:12] have you've been born again I'm reading
[1:39:14] out of your title deed this
[1:39:15] morning I'm reading out of the word of
[1:39:17] God that says this is what the
[1:39:19] inheritance of the righteous is
[1:39:22] of the sinless Spotless bride of Christ
[1:39:23] this is for you I'm telling you what God
[1:39:26] has put under your name in your bank
[1:39:28] account
[1:39:31] amen I don't know what we're dealing
[1:39:33] with this morning I know some things
[1:39:34] we're dealing with but I don't know all
[1:39:36] of it you know what you're dealing with
[1:39:38] you know where he's Satan's pressing in
[1:39:40] maybe he's got a stronghold this
[1:39:43] morning but you look at that and you can
[1:39:45] if you can find your place in the word
[1:39:46] if you can find your promise in the word
[1:39:48] then Satan has to move Satan has to move
[1:39:52] amen maybe you're scared cuz you've
[1:39:54] tried and
[1:39:55] failed anybody else tried and failed
[1:39:57] before it's always harder the second
[1:39:59] time isn't it or the third time or the
[1:40:03] 10th
[1:40:05] time just say Lord I'm coming once again
[1:40:08] just once more Lord give me an
[1:40:10] opportunity to believe your word once
[1:40:13] more that's all Samson said at the end
[1:40:15] Lord just once more he died just once
[1:40:19] more and we'll live men and freedom will
[1:40:21] reign in our hearts and lives man if the
[1:40:24] musicians would come this morning I'm
[1:40:26] just going to read two scriptures in a
[1:40:28] quote cuz I want to tell you a bit about
[1:40:30] your enemy this
[1:40:31] morning you know let me show you how
[1:40:33] this ends for him and it's a prophecy
[1:40:35] that's written but it's written in the
[1:40:38] present and Isaiah said this he says how
[1:40:41] art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer
[1:40:43] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[1:40:46] to the ground which did we weaken the
[1:40:48] Nations for thou Hast said in thine
[1:40:51] heart I will Ascend into heaven I will
[1:40:54] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[1:40:56] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:40:58] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:41:01] will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:41:03] clouds I will be like the most high i i
[1:41:06] i i
[1:41:09] i that's what I
[1:41:12] said but here's what the word says yet
[1:41:16] Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to
[1:41:19] the sides of the pit now here's your
[1:41:21] part
[1:41:22] Church they that see thee shall narrowly
[1:41:26] look upon thee and consider the say as
[1:41:29] this the man that made the Earth to
[1:41:30] tremble that did Shake
[1:41:32] kingdoms church when you see who's been
[1:41:35] bothering you all this time you're going
[1:41:38] to say that little
[1:41:39] pipsqueak is the one I was scared
[1:41:44] of that little
[1:41:46] wimp that
[1:41:48] shrimp that's who I was fighting because
[1:41:52] remember he's a
[1:41:54] bluff he's a
[1:41:57] bluff and I hope we don't say if I knew
[1:41:59] he was this small I would have pressed
[1:42:01] harder I would have taken more I would
[1:42:04] have believed more I would have done
[1:42:07] more look church he wrote this in the
[1:42:11] present even though it was in the future
[1:42:13] so we know this is what's going to
[1:42:15] happen you're going to have a day where
[1:42:18] you're going to come over here and
[1:42:19] you're going to look down at Satan and
[1:42:20] going to
[1:42:22] say
[1:42:24] really
[1:42:27] really church are we being fooled this
[1:42:30] morning by a
[1:42:33] pipsqueak we've got a word of God that
[1:42:35] tells us he's a
[1:42:36] pipsqueak that he's a bluff that he's

[1:43:31] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[1:43:33] down out of Heaven which accuse him
[1:43:36] before our God day and night so God
[1:43:38] defeats Satan in heaven and then he
[1:43:40] sends them down to earth and guess what
[1:43:41] happens on
[1:43:42] Earth and they who's
[1:43:46] they
[1:43:47] they

[1:43:51] overcame
[1:43:53] him he got defeated up there and God
[1:43:55] sent him down and says now my bride's
[1:43:57] going to beat you up they overcame him
[1:44:00] how by the blood of the Lamb Church
[1:44:03] Without Calvary we've lost already he
[1:44:06] says
[1:44:07] but and by the word of their testimony
[1:44:10] and they love not their lives under the
[1:44:12] death you can't win without Calvary but
[1:44:14] your words matter your testimony matters
[1:44:17] and the word of Our Testimony is right
[1:44:19] here that's when we s what the word says
[1:44:22] and we do what the word does and that's
[1:44:24] what gives us the victory
[1:44:26] amen God wrote
[1:44:28] this God takes John up into a higher
[1:44:31] place and he writes it in the past
[1:44:38] tense God has written your Victory is
[1:44:41] already
[1:44:44] done the French would say F
[1:44:47] comp it's done it's a finished work your
[1:44:50] victory has already been written into
[1:44:52] the scripture and the word cannot fail
[1:44:55] your Victory your overcoming testimony
[1:44:58] is already there that you overcame by
[1:45:00] the blood of the lamb and how you
[1:45:02] confess the word of God in your life and
[1:45:04] how you acted on it amen let's stand
[1:45:06] this morning God wrote this the spirit
[1:45:10] of the truth comes to John and he lifts
[1:45:11] him up into this place and he writes
[1:45:13] that scripture to show you things that
[1:45:15] are to be remember what the Jesus said
[1:45:17] of this this the the spirit of Truth he
[1:45:19] says when he comes
[1:45:21] what he'll lead and guide you into all
[1:45:22] truth and he'll show you things to come
[1:45:25] I'm showing you things to come cuz the
[1:45:28] time for things to come is right now he
[1:45:30] wouldn't just show you what's going to
[1:45:31] happen but he'll show you the events in
[1:45:33] your own life he'll bring it to pass in
[1:45:35] your own life it's already recorded
[1:45:37] remember what I said brother Hank said
[1:45:39] that it's already on the film you've
[1:45:41] already overcome you've already been
[1:45:44] healed you've already been delivered

[1:45:47] have to walk through the film now
[1:45:49] brother brah says said this and when we
[1:45:52] take our stand today when men say these
[1:45:54] things can happen don't be fussing with
[1:45:56] them that's wrong don't fuss with them
[1:45:58] but pick up the sword he says you look
[1:46:01] at what's supposed to be in this day
[1:46:03] when God gave his promise for today pick
[1:46:06] this up and go and all the goliaths will
[1:46:10] fall under

[1:46:22] it's not bad
[1:46:23] enough that we go to God about it and
[1:46:27] you know what that's the little
[1:46:28] things that suck the life out of us it's
[1:46:31] the little things that take our energy
[1:46:33] that take our victory that take our
[1:46:35] testimony because if Satan can't get you
[1:46:37] on the big things he'll get you in the
[1:46:38] little
[1:46:39] things you know it was striking you know
