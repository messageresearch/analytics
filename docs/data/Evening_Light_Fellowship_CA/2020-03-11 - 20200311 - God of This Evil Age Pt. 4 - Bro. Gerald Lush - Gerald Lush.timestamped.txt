[47:22] leadership his advice amen
[47:25] not my will father don't be done I'll
[47:27] tell you that's that's a strong
[47:29] statement that's a big statement because
[47:31] there's many things that we want to do
[47:33] we want to do this we want to do that
[47:35] when it comes to our natural natural
[47:37] means but I mean it's gonna let let let
[47:40] him make the decision amen
[47:42] now you but it's gonna let him make the
[47:44] decision well I'll tell you this there's
[47:46] so many too many believers during their
[47:49] live in their own lives
[47:49] oh no they're not live by the spirit
[47:51] they're led by the their there's human
[47:54] senses but again if you're the if you're
[47:57] the seed of God if you're the bride of
[47:58] Christ you're led by the spirit there's
[48:01] absolutely nothing that you're gonna
[48:03] make the decision a male it's him Lord
[48:06] what do you want me to do Lord where do
[48:08] you want me to go how do you want me to
[48:10] do it when do you want me to do it Lord
[48:11] amen sons and daughters of God are led
[48:15] by the Spirit of God amen
[48:17] I don't care what it is it doesn't say
[48:19] oh it's just this it's just that it's
[48:21] just religion no no he's controlling
[48:25] your life
[48:25] amen and through his word his word is
[48:28] controlling your life not my will father
[48:30] time be done again not many are going to
[48:33] say it not me really really really got
[48:36] such control given over to the Lord but
[48:38] I pray that by the grace of God ministry
[48:41] to those that have given him control
[48:43] they may it your thoughts your words and
[48:46] your deeds is in his control amen and
[48:50] he's there to convict you when it comes
[48:51] to a wrong thought a wrong word or wrong
[48:54] deke the Holy Ghost would convict you
[48:55] amen
[48:56] as the power of God has highlighted the
[48:58] fact and he said that he that year of
[49:00] theophany is not 12 feet from you at any
[49:03] given time and the
[49:05] time that he'll pull away is if you see
[49:07] it and what does it do if we sin we have
[49:10] an advocate with the father but Sidney
[49:12] said doesn't doesn't change our
[49:14] relationship it just interrupts our
[49:16] fellowship a man but again the theophany
[49:19] withdrawal away but then when you repent
[49:21] he comes back again is conviction you
[49:24] repent you're back in fellowship again
[49:27] praise the name of the Lord to God be
[49:29] the glory a man it's a tremendous
[49:32] tremendous challenge to our faith and
[49:35] again to ask you to remember in prayer
[49:40] our brother rod sister Shirley snow

[49:45] mainland on Monday so the help they'll
[49:48] be back here in Bishop falls on Monday

[59:28] thank you Jesus
[59:30] amen praise the Lord God bless just
[59:33] totally me to Revelation chapter 13
[59:37] revelation 13 a man flattered brother
[59:43] onic made it and our brother Joshua rode
[59:47] on again his family lore blesses a man
[59:51] praying grace for those not able to make
[59:53] it tonight and the grace of God to those
[59:55] that did come and those that will and
[59:58] have to it deal with the weather outside
[1:00:00] as you go home tonight so the Lord
[1:00:02] blesses a man for the glory of God and
[1:00:06] in Revelation chapter 13 and beginning
[1:00:09] to read at verse 1 and I stood upon the
[1:00:14] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[1:00:19] out of the sea having seven heads and
[1:00:23] ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns
[1:00:27] and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
[1:00:31] a man so we're not impressed with that
[1:00:35] we thank God for the revelation and the
[1:00:39] Beast which I saw was like unto a
[1:00:43] leopard and his feet were as the feet of
[1:00:47] a bear and his mouth as the mouth of the
[1:00:51] lion and the dragon gave him his power a
[1:00:56] man and his seat and great Authority and
[1:01:03] I saw one of his heads as it were
[1:01:07] wounded to death and his deadly wound
[1:01:11] was healed amazing and all the world
[1:01:18] wondered after the Beast and they
[1:01:23] worshiped the dragon amazing they
[1:01:28] worshipped the Dragon which gave power
[1:01:30] unto the Beast and they worshipped the
[1:01:34] Beast saying who is like unto the Beast
[1:01:38] who is
[1:01:39] able to make war with him the world is
[1:01:42] deceived by the beasts and the dragon
[1:01:47] who is able to make war with him and
[1:01:50] whether it was given unto him a mouth
[1:01:52] speaking great things and blasphemies
[1:01:57] just consider the power the authority
[1:02:01] that he had Amen so there was given unto
[1:02:05] him a mouth speaking great things and
[1:02:08] blasphemies and power was given unto him
[1:02:12] to continue forty and two months or
[1:02:15] three and a half years and he opened his
[1:02:21] mouth in blasphemy against God to
[1:02:25] blaspheme his name it's in this hour
[1:02:30] it's in this age we're dealing with the
[1:02:34] Beast
[1:02:35] we're dealing with the god of this world
[1:02:37] a man and it says he opened his mouth to
[1:02:44] bless in blasphemy against God to
[1:02:48] blaspheme his name anything that was
[1:02:51] revealed in the mystery of the seals is
[1:02:53] the revelation of the name even our Lord
[1:02:56] Jesus Christ a mayor it is non Father
[1:03:00] Son and Holy Ghost but it is the name of
[1:03:03] Father Son and Holy Ghost amen so we
[1:03:07] pray God and thank God for the name
[1:03:10] anything God for sharing with us the
[1:03:13] name praise the Lord praise the Lord a
[1:03:16] man it was in the bridegroom now it's in
[1:03:19] the bride because the bride takes the
[1:03:21] name of the right girl
[1:03:23] praise the Lord so I trust that you feel
[1:03:26] honored that you're identified with the
[1:03:29] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:03:31] and then you can share his name even in
[1:03:33] water baptism a man in prayer you got
[1:03:36] the authority for the name a man to use
[1:03:39] the name and God will honor your request
[1:03:42] anything you ask in that name he said
[1:03:45] the father will do it praise the name of
[1:03:48] the Lord
[1:03:48] Alleluia we'll ask according to the will
[1:03:51] of God
[1:03:52] so again
[1:03:53] verse six and he opened his mouth in
[1:03:55] blasphemy against God to blaspheme his
[1:03:58] name and he did and his tablet and his
[1:04:02] tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[1:04:06] and it was given unto him to make war
[1:04:09] with the Saints and to overcome them and
[1:04:13] power was given him over all Kindred's
[1:04:16] and tongues and Nations
[1:04:18] brother the beast is going to control
[1:04:20] the world a mad once the bride goes out
[1:04:23] the Beast takes control
[1:04:26] amen and it says and power was given him
[1:04:31] over all Kindred's tongues and nations
[1:04:34] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:04:36] worship Him whose names are not written
[1:04:41] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[1:04:44] from the foundation of the world If any
[1:04:49] man a venire let him hear god bless his
[1:04:52] words you may be seated
[1:04:53] again a confirmation of the god of this
[1:04:57] evil age a man that he that it's not a
[1:05:01] fairytale it is the fulfillment of the
[1:05:03] prophecy of the word that God has
[1:05:06] prophesied even in Revelation a man that
[1:05:10] that God is going to rise with Authority
[1:05:13] and power in the world a man so much
[1:05:17] that he's going to deceive if possible
[1:05:19] the very elect
[1:05:20] that's how closer it's going to be to
[1:05:23] the real a man God is going to be here
[1:05:25] God is going to be doing this God is
[1:05:27] going to be going to be revealing his
[1:05:29] word and the devil is going to be there
[1:05:31] impersonating what God is doing a man so
[1:05:34] we pray the grace of God to be with us
[1:05:36] that we're not going to be deceived amen
[1:05:39] the grace of God to be with us amen that
[1:05:42] we're going to stay with the truck we're
[1:05:44] to stay with the word we're going to
[1:05:45] stay with what God has revealed to us
[1:05:47] and when the enemy comes in amen yeah
[1:05:50] yeah God's read but but we're not going
[1:05:52] to listen to him a man will let the
[1:05:54] goats listen to him but those sheep and
[1:05:57] lambs we're not going to listen to him
[1:05:58] amen
[1:05:59] and again and as the warning is to the
[1:06:02] sheep and the Lambs to beware of the
[1:06:04] enemy when he comes because there's
[1:06:06] close it would deceive the very elect
[1:06:08] brother this is serious don't think
[1:06:11] because we're not in denomination well
[1:06:13] God brought us out and the rest of the
[1:06:15] world is be being deceived by
[1:06:16] denominations no it's going to be worse
[1:06:18] than that
[1:06:19] amen brother we're gonna work with
[1:06:21] others like it like I said I felt so bad
[1:06:23] when I was neatly at the altar that time
[1:06:25] years ago and anybody that might have
[1:06:28] been almost 50 years ago and there was
[1:06:30] there was a certain believer right next
[1:06:32] to me there and they were praying and
[1:06:34] they were saying oh lord I thank you for
[1:06:36] bringing us out of denominations and now
[1:06:39] Lord we don't have to be subject to any
[1:06:41] man and I said Lord forgive them I said
[1:06:45] they're not they're not acknowledging
[1:06:46] the truth of your word you brought a
[1:06:48] note from there and you bring them under
[1:06:50] the under whole yeah under the authority
[1:06:52] of man I said even a prophet a man there
[1:06:55] they got to be subject to the Prophet
[1:06:57] and now for the ministry of the Prophet
[1:06:59] you had to be serving to a 5-volt
[1:07:00] ministry why because the Prophet said no
[1:07:03] he said you young ministers he says
[1:07:05] you're ordained to take this message on
[1:07:08] to the coming of the Lord
[1:07:10] a man so both of the Prophet is not here
[1:07:12] but again brother our emphasis is not on
[1:07:14] William Branham William Branham William
[1:07:16] Branham it not just on profit profit
[1:07:18] profit now it's on Christ in the bride
[1:07:21] and the bride in Christ amen because he
[1:07:24] has come down he revealed himself
[1:07:26] through the prophetic ministry and what
[1:07:28] what is he doing he's entered into a
[1:07:30] oneness with his bride he is Kali his
[1:07:32] bride a man he redeemed her now he has
[1:07:35] come down to get her a man and he's
[1:07:37] going to take her home so though brother
[1:07:40] sister the emphasis on Christ with you
[1:07:42] Christ in us Christ the bride he has
[1:07:45] entered into become one with us because
[1:07:48] the bride and the bridegroom become one
[1:07:50] by the grace of God and brother I tell
[1:07:53] you sir we're going back and just
[1:07:54] putting the emphasis on the Prophet and
[1:07:57] all William Branham will around
[1:07:58] we're not enter into a oneness with
[1:08:00] Jesus brother so we got to move on and I
[1:08:04] tell you this when the man wouldn't want
[1:08:05] to do that not by any means because just
[1:08:08] like when they went at that time when
[1:08:10] we're in Bantam went to the pulpit and
[1:08:12] this brother came over and he and he put
[1:08:14] a note in William brother's pocket and
[1:08:16] brother Ram before he got to the Pope
[1:08:18] took a took the no doubt any read it and
[1:08:21] he said william branham is my lord
[1:08:24] well then i guess in a sense they might
[1:08:26] have shocked with their brain them but
[1:08:28] when he got up to preach before he
[1:08:30] preached and he said now he said i want
[1:08:32] to do i want to make the note of this
[1:08:33] and he said her brother just put it in
[1:08:35] my pocket a many now of course he knew
[1:08:38] it was and at the time their brother was
[1:08:42] was in the room there and he was
[1:08:45] recording the sermon exactly and brother
[1:08:49] brown said when brother brows that i'm
[1:08:50] going to preach on this their brother
[1:08:52] even changed the title a man oh yeah
[1:08:56] he changed the title due to line up with
[1:08:58] with the way that he believed it but the
[1:09:00] part of God said this and so on so I
[1:09:03] like that some other time to you
[1:09:05] concerning the title but brother Brown
[1:09:07] said listen he said don't you do this he
[1:09:10] said if you do this again
[1:09:11] he said I'll leave the ministry and he
[1:09:15] said I just had to leave it and I want
[1:09:17] one preach no more he said because he
[1:09:18] said why he said because this is anti
[1:09:21] grace a man and brother that all my
[1:09:24] brothers sister if it was Antichrist
[1:09:26] then how much more genetic race now a
[1:09:29] man because they're Bobbitt is gone and
[1:09:32] he went on so the only one now that we
[1:09:34] had to do with his Christ in the
[1:09:37] revealed Word a million and so brother a
[1:09:40] who was Antichrist vanna said of Christ
[1:09:42] now he says you're making me and a
[1:09:45] crisis what he's saying so brother
[1:09:47] sister there there's many a believer
[1:09:48] today still making William Branham
[1:09:50] Antichrist and they're becoming
[1:09:52] Antichrist themselves a man because why
[1:09:55] because they're not putting the emphasis
[1:09:56] on the revealed word coming through the
[1:09:58] ministry but it just exudes are still
[1:10:01] back there you know fifty years or fifty
[1:10:04] five years with the Prophet they're
[1:10:06] still back there back here 1965 when
[1:10:09] that message was preached they're back
[1:10:11] there
[1:10:12] maybe 1963 or 1961 those messages were
[1:10:15] preached brother we gotta get into the
[1:10:17] revelation
[1:10:18] although those messages for the day a
[1:10:21] man brother they meant one thing back
[1:10:23] there but now that needs something else
[1:10:25] is absolute truth brother well yeah the
[1:10:28] problem of gods that I he said I know
[1:10:30] it's not striking you the way that it
[1:10:32] should
[1:10:33] that was 55 years ago he says not
[1:10:35] striking me the way that it should
[1:10:37] why because it wasn't coming to
[1:10:40] fulfillment but now with you and me this
[1:10:43] message here on the god of this evil age
[1:10:45] brother and now now we see it in a
[1:10:48] greater way than they saw it over 50
[1:10:50] years ago we see it in a greater way
[1:10:53] than they saw it 40 years ago brother
[1:10:55] sister way because now we're seeing the
[1:10:58] god of this evil age a may reveal
[1:11:00] himself more we see his influence among
[1:11:03] the people more in this hour and they
[1:11:05] say then we did 40 years ago we see his
[1:11:08] influence among them even more now than
[1:11:10] we did even 20 years ago I can I can I
[1:11:13] can vindicate that I can prove that a
[1:11:16] man brother sister after after being
[1:11:18] around this message in this message than
[1:11:21] I trust the message in me for over 50
[1:11:23] years brother I know what was going on
[1:11:26] 50 years ago I know what was going on at
[1:11:29] 45 years ago 40 and 30 years ago I know
[1:11:32] the spirit that was on the people I know
[1:11:35] the auntie tree that was in the people
[1:11:36] ain't bad they're brothers they now know
[1:11:39] yet the whole thing is changing
[1:11:40] completely amen brother it's not the
[1:11:43] same spirit not the same Adoni that it
[1:11:45] was revenge that it was 40 or 50 years
[1:11:48] ago a million brother I'm dealing with a
[1:11:50] lot different spirits now than I did
[1:11:52] then
[1:11:52] amen brother we're duty we with our
[1:11:55] spirit back then as well
[1:11:57] but we're trying to get the people more
[1:11:59] at a denomination more away from that
[1:12:01] get away get away get more into the word
[1:12:03] get more into the word a man moving away
[1:12:06] from within brown lorry into the word so
[1:12:09] they will know what God has done what
[1:12:11] God is doing and what God will do a man
[1:12:15] we do what God did amen 55 years ago in
[1:12:18] the message of the Prophet but and we
[1:12:21] then we were getting into what he was
[1:12:22] doing
[1:12:22] fifty years ago and forty years ago and
[1:12:25] thirty years ago but brother after 1977
[1:12:29] we had to start getting into what he do
[1:12:31] what he's going to do a man and brother
[1:12:34] they're dead what he was going to do
[1:12:36] he's doing now I know it's the present
[1:12:38] tense again God bringing us out of the
[1:12:40] future out of the past into the present
[1:12:43] brother to get us into the present tense
[1:12:45] revelation of what he is doing a man
[1:12:50] there were the present tense revelation
[1:12:52] of what he was doing 40 50 years ago 30
[1:12:55] years ago 8 million but after 1977
[1:12:58] brother the anointing was changing on
[1:13:00] the bride hey babe
[1:13:02] and when we will begin to what because
[1:13:04] we started to get into the word we
[1:13:06] started to get into the message a man
[1:13:09] and Christ was beginning to take is
[1:13:11] right and our lady can bring us into a
[1:13:13] revelation of Resurrection and rattray
[1:13:17] faith a man because the part of God said
[1:13:20] that that's what the that's the mystery
[1:13:21] of the of the seven seals that is the
[1:13:24] mystery of what God was doing in his
[1:13:25] ministry a man it was the revelation of
[1:13:29] the word to give the bride brought
[1:13:31] through faith a man brother but again we
[1:13:35] didn't get into that we weren't seeing
[1:13:36] that we want to get where they getting
[1:13:37] that understanding for you know 50 years
[1:13:40] ago 40 years ago or 30 years ago but
[1:13:43] again you by 19 and 77 that is when
[1:13:46] believers started again into the to the
[1:13:48] word believer started to get into the
[1:13:50] message they were they believed God's on
[1:13:53] a prophet but they began to focus not on
[1:13:55] the profit but they begin to focus on
[1:13:57] the message amen brother for many years
[1:14:01] many many years we were all preaching
[1:14:03] goddess and a prophet goddess and a
[1:14:05] private goddess and a brother
[1:14:07] unfortunately they're still those who
[1:14:09] are focusing on that revelation God has
[1:14:12] sent a prophet anybody but brother we
[1:14:14] got to get out of that and we got to get
[1:14:16] into voice or the prophet and so that
[1:14:18] God is going to start making it
[1:14:20] manifesting you and me
[1:14:22] why should whatever what he going to go
[1:14:24] through the Prophet well God is doing
[1:14:26] that he you and me God is fulfilling it
[1:14:28] in you and me
[1:14:29] all right you wanted to know why God
[1:14:31] sent a prophet watch what he's doing in
[1:14:33] the bride a man what he's doing in there
[1:14:36] that's what he said the profit so now
[1:14:38] we're not going to say it's not going to
[1:14:40] go around the world preaching goddess
[1:14:42] and a prophet we're going to start
[1:14:44] preaching why should the Prophet amen
[1:14:46] they get us out of that and into the
[1:14:48] resurrection out of that into the
[1:14:50] rapture amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:53] see brother sisters just like our
[1:14:55] brother Luther there and Wesley and all
[1:14:57] the others have been accost ones they
[1:14:59] they were moving God did this God did
[1:15:01] that God did that but eventually it all
[1:15:03] became past tense amen it was past tense
[1:15:06] a way to move on to something else see
[1:15:09] it's like it's like a lot of a of the
[1:15:11] Pentecostals and Abele though oh praise
[1:15:14] the Lord praise the Lord and the
[1:15:16] anointing began to move away
[1:15:17] oh yeah the emphasis on the gifts and
[1:15:20] you know at the bachelors were the Holy
[1:15:22] Ghost are speaking of John's and it
[1:15:24] began to go down down down a lot of the
[1:15:27] old fashioned Pentecostals they were
[1:15:28] wondering well Lord what is next because
[1:15:32] the anointing is not not not in the
[1:15:33] Pentecostal message now like it used to
[1:15:36] be so Lord what are you going to do next
[1:15:38] so they many of them believe they made
[1:15:40] they they door was right what they were
[1:15:43] thinking those old-fashioned ones they
[1:15:45] were right but they never recognized
[1:15:48] that when God was doing it they believe
[1:15:50] a man that the crowning of the event
[1:15:52] acosta message would be the coming of
[1:15:54] the Lord that's the truth
[1:15:56] oh yeah and the Prophet himself even
[1:15:59] even they even mention it
[1:16:01] and he should always show the panic all
[1:16:02] semester people issue they believe that
[1:16:05] years ago amen but they've when God
[1:16:07] fulfilled it in the Ministry of Malachi
[1:16:10] for a million praise the name of the
[1:16:12] Lord
[1:16:13] they never recognized that it was Christ
[1:16:15] coming down to receive his bride
[1:16:18] amen Christ coming down to get his brain
[1:16:20] Christ coming down to anoint his brain
[1:16:23] now with the Pentecostal and 80 yes that
[1:16:26] yes and he anointed the bride with when
[1:16:30] Luther Wesley Pentecost amen
[1:16:32] but he was going to crown it amen
[1:16:35] whether with a message that would give
[1:16:38] the bride resurrection and Raftery faith
[1:16:39] to take us into glory amen but the old
[1:16:43] fashioned Pentecostals of course they
[1:16:44] went off the scene and
[1:16:46] they were there they weren't here to
[1:16:47] recognize it they weren't here to be
[1:16:49] part of it hey man they they boy God
[1:16:51] ordained him to do a man that God was
[1:16:54] raised in another generation a man in
[1:16:56] this hour this age to fulfill what he
[1:17:00] wants to do that he can come and live in
[1:17:02] you and live in me and what and manifest
[1:17:05] the resurrection in the rapture praise
[1:17:08] the Lord hallelujah brother God is not
[1:17:10] just looking to to manifest luther's
[1:17:12] through a message or Wesley's message or
[1:17:14] the Pentecostal message now in a small
[1:17:16] he's done it the world has been the
[1:17:19] world has been given a witness the world
[1:17:21] will be given the testimony of
[1:17:22] justification say to vacation the
[1:17:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:26] but brother the thing that they're that
[1:17:28] they're looking for they're not looking
[1:17:30] for the thing that they need to get into
[1:17:32] now is the resurrection of the rapture
[1:17:33] they need to get into the revelation
[1:17:36] that is giving us the faith the
[1:17:38] revelation of the Resurrection and the
[1:17:41] rapture what God is doing how God is
[1:17:43] doing it amen
[1:17:45] Oh a thing with it oh yeah well you know
[1:17:48] after a while there's got a couple of
[1:17:50] Resurrection and this is going to happen
[1:17:52] come a resurrection that's going to
[1:17:55] happen though reading any and concerning
[1:17:58] the oh yeah it was on my Matthew Matthew
[1:18:04] and Reese's commentaries and so on
[1:18:07] concerning the hour that you and I are
[1:18:09] living and and he was pointing to the
[1:18:11] resurrection but they a brother either
[1:18:13] the revelation that he had was the
[1:18:16] revelation of Pentecostal say the Luther
[1:18:18] had Wesley had amen but brother garner
[1:18:21] took us on into the into the Ministry of
[1:18:23] Malachi for and the opening of the seven
[1:18:25] seals the mystery of God amen to give us
[1:18:28] a revelation of the coming of the Lord
[1:18:31] the revelation of the resurrection and
[1:18:34] the rapture amen
[1:18:36] but our brother Matthew Andrea and God
[1:18:39] bless him a man because our brother
[1:18:42] Branham he had Matthew in his
[1:18:44] commentaries even in his library and
[1:18:47] when I when I was there a man in his
[1:18:50] home in Tucson I saw it it was there a
[1:18:52] man
[1:18:54] he didn't agree with my mother math you
[1:18:56] want everything but a lot of things he
[1:18:58] did but matter in he was pointing to the
[1:19:00] resurrection you're playing to the
[1:19:02] rapture the same way that Luther a
[1:19:04] Wesley the Pentecostals believe that the
[1:19:06] resurrection was coming they believe in
[1:19:08] the rapture was coming a man exactly
[1:19:11] like I said that I had a book I don't
[1:19:13] know they still got it or not by a
[1:19:14] certain church not a messy church and
[1:19:17] and then a picture there of the
[1:19:20] resurrection of the rapture and I said
[1:19:22] Lord I said that was according to the
[1:19:24] revelation that they had I said maybe a
[1:19:27] hundred years ago but I said we're gone
[1:19:30] beyond that now and then the picture of
[1:19:33] the resurrection a man and the rapture
[1:19:35] only the picture a painting rather you
[1:19:39] know a like in a graveyard and they were
[1:19:41] looking up and there was Jesus coming
[1:19:43] down and oh my ear was the graves
[1:19:46] opening up in the painting the graves

[1:23:51] crowning of the of all the messages the
[1:23:54] crying of all that God has done and God
[1:23:55] is dead was the was Malachi for the
[1:23:59] crying is the calling out of the bride
[1:24:01] for the resurrection and the rapture
[1:24:03] amen
[1:24:04] to give us a revelation of the
[1:24:06] resurrection that that is not going to
[1:24:07] be like that it's not gonna be like that
[1:24:09] it's gonna be like this amen amen
[1:24:12] brother there's like I when I go by a
[1:24:15] graveyard I had someone a solid somebody
[1:24:18] has asked me you know what maybe a
[1:24:19] couple of times you know how many is
[1:24:21] dead there in the graveyard and I said
[1:24:24] how many well I said they're all dead I
[1:24:27] said because if they weren't dead they
[1:24:29] won't be there I said when it comes to
[1:24:32] physically they're all dead but I said
[1:24:34] how many I said is still alive in a
[1:24:35] theophany body somewhere I don't know
[1:24:37] but again when when Lazarus died he rose
[1:24:40] in what they called the bosom of Abraham
[1:24:41] and when the rich man died he rose in in
[1:24:44] in the fire oh yeah so he oh my brother
[1:24:49] just think during a place of torment do
[1:24:53] use it in a place of peace
[1:24:54] or a place of torment Amen sir brother
[1:24:59] sister God pointed us to it in Luther
[1:25:02] and Wesley point of that generation and
[1:25:04] the Pentecostals you have plenty us
[1:25:06] through the resurrection players to the
[1:25:07] rapture but a mother was in this hour it
[1:25:10] was the crowning of the Pentecostal
[1:25:12] message with the revelation of how God
[1:25:15] was going to bring the resurrection in
[1:25:17] the rapture amen
[1:25:19] how is God going to do it brother I pray
[1:25:21] grace that we're now we're not just
[1:25:23] going on to the resurrection
[1:25:25] like they were when I going on to the
[1:25:27] resurrection I knew there are the
[1:25:28] Pentecostals but Brennan
[1:25:30] revelation of the resurrection Edea to
[1:25:33] the revelation of the rapture a man
[1:25:35] brother in the neighborhood audience on
[1:25:37] nd York asunder by a man oh brother

[1:25:42] know if you read the devotion in in our
[1:25:46] brothers gods book within the last
[1:25:49] couple of days but the problem of God
[1:25:51] was there and there somebody was praying
[1:25:53] and at the same time another brother was
[1:25:55] speaking in tongues amen and the rod of
[1:25:58] God said I think that brother he said
[1:26:00] for speaking in tongues and he said he
[1:26:02] was interpreting what the brother was
[1:26:03] saying was praying a man because this
[1:26:06] the Holy Ghost we can't at her but only
[1:26:09] ghost can he spit the Roman roamin says
[1:26:12] he speaks in this language amen and as
[1:26:15] her brother was praying out for brother
[1:26:16] Branham or somebody or brother round
[1:26:18] pray for somebody else
[1:26:19] this brother spoke in tongues yeah
[1:26:21] brother Brown says thank you god bless
[1:26:24] you amen so that was good amen so
[1:26:28] brother God is God is amen
[1:26:31] interpreting his word God is revealing
[1:26:33] his word God is pressing upon us what he
[1:26:36] wants us to hear and what he wants us to
[1:26:38] be late brother God is pressing upon us
[1:26:41] what he wants to make flesh in us amen
[1:26:45] so that will believe the word on the
[1:26:47] inside the inside to the extent that we
[1:26:50] become one with it
[1:26:51] anybody and God is going to work it out
[1:26:53] by the grace of God God is making they
[1:26:56] making it as it were flesh and us the
[1:26:58] revelation of the resurrection
[1:27:00] amen amen praise the Lord no wonder the
[1:27:03] prophet of God said he said the dead are
[1:27:05] waiting on us amen when you look for to
[1:27:10] come to that revelation amen amen amen
[1:27:14] as Jesus was talking to Mary Martha and
[1:27:16] concerning Lazarus her brother that was
[1:27:19] dead and Annie's release and I am the
[1:27:21] eel rides again oh yes she said he'll
[1:27:24] rise up there yeah in the resurrection
[1:27:26] in the future yeah jesus said I am the
[1:27:30] resurrection
[1:27:31] amen he said believe us now this a man
[1:27:36] brother she didn't have the weight for
[1:27:38] the resurrection up there so there are
[1:27:40] 2000 years away he was right there
[1:27:43] we
[1:27:44] hooray for the resurrection up there the
[1:27:46] resurrection is in us the resurrection
[1:27:49] is with us because he said then he said
[1:27:52] I am the resurrection a man and brother
[1:27:56] he's the resurrection tell me that he
[1:27:58] proved he was the rapture a man because
[1:28:01] he didn't know when he come up and bring
[1:28:02] that body back up again
[1:28:03] he went near Oxford it he did 2,000
[1:28:07] years ago he went up in a rapture he
[1:28:09] came back in the Holy Ghost amen to
[1:28:12] reveal himself in his break until he
[1:28:14] would come again to the full revelation
[1:28:15] of the Resurrection and the full
[1:28:18] revelation of the rapture anyway and
[1:28:20] that site is going to be made first in
[1:28:22] his break
[1:28:23] they managed to bring the resurrection
[1:28:25] and the rapture that's why the dead in
[1:28:27] Christ are waiting on us do you have the
[1:28:30] revelation of the resurrection oh yeah
[1:28:31] it's up there no he's made flesh in the
[1:28:34] bride don't you see don't you recognize
[1:28:37] what he did in Malachi 4 don't you
[1:28:39] recognize what he did in will in Rose
[1:28:41] ministry amen the public God constantly
[1:28:43] said and he said listen he said this was
[1:28:46] not means and I can't do this and
[1:28:49] because he was deserting the thoughts
[1:28:51] and intents of the heart
[1:28:52] and he was you know any USAO thus saith
[1:28:54] the lord you're healed thus said the
[1:28:56] Lord thus saith the Lord and there are
[1:28:58] doers two or three people there one time
[1:29:00] in church had died but they came back to
[1:29:02] life he raised him again well because
[1:29:04] the resurrection of the rapture what he
[1:29:06] wasn't William Branham wasn't it was
[1:29:08] Christ in him it was that ministry that
[1:29:11] was in control and brother amen
[1:29:13] it was the ministry that is in the bride
[1:29:15] and he was revealing himself in the
[1:29:17] prophetic ministry to let us know easier
[1:29:19] oh not just William Branham William
[1:29:22] Branham we don't read no it's too bright
[1:29:24] mister believers exactly that's why he
[1:29:29] wanted to get the people to believe a
[1:29:31] man by the grace of Almighty God and he
[1:29:35] would see the audience this way you City
[1:29:37] on is that way and he would say he would
[1:29:39] see the the pillar of fire or he would
[1:29:41] see the light and some places there do
[1:29:44] you see darkness why because I'm belief
[1:29:48] but he was what he was looking for faith
[1:29:52] any man and brother
[1:29:56] there was faith there
[1:29:58] pulley on the anointing they were
[1:29:59] pulling on the gift they were pulling on
[1:30:01] what what God was revealing through this
[1:30:03] man called William Branham but he said
[1:30:06] he got out of the way so Jesus could do
[1:30:09] what he want to do amen
[1:30:12] whether they recognize Jesus in in what
[1:30:15] he was doing the recognize Jesus
[1:30:17] absolute truth there there were many
[1:30:19] many evangelists and many Pentecostals
[1:30:21] many many so others remain on
[1:30:24] denominations back there that day they
[1:30:26] they saw this is God this is God this
[1:30:28] shouldn't Lord you this is exactly what
[1:30:30] you did 2,000 years ago but they not
[1:30:33] acknowledge that but they couldn't make
[1:30:35] knowledge the truth that he was
[1:30:36] preaching no they said how do we how do
[1:30:39] we reconcile into this sign how do we
[1:30:41] reconcile this ministry with what what
[1:30:44] the man is preaching they couldn't do it
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:47] because he was going beyond Pentecost
[1:30:50] beyond though they're beyond Wesley he
[1:30:52] was going beyond denominations he was
[1:30:55] going into the revealed word amen but
[1:30:58] brother I tell the bride recognized it
[1:31:02] they recognized it was gone
[1:31:04] amen I pray grace that we recognize it
[1:31:07] was God it was crates coming down with
[1:31:10] resurrection around through faith and
[1:31:12] that's why again that the daily Christ
[1:31:14] are waiting on us and he said God is
[1:31:17] waiting on us just to many believers so
[1:31:20] called waiting on God that is the

[1:32:28] before you had the reserve as he
[1:32:30] quickened you as a resurrected who were
[1:32:34] dead in sins and trespasses and we have
[1:32:37] been caught up in devil II places in
[1:32:38] Christ and again the prophecy what's

[1:33:21] the spirit a man and to believe that
[1:33:24] Lord that you are the resurrection in
[1:33:26] the rapture he said I am he said believe
[1:33:30] us though this brother he was going to
[1:33:33] raise Lazarus from the dead and he did
[1:33:36] very bad so in this hour this age he's
[1:33:40] going to raise the bride a man couldn't
[1:33:42] not bring her out of their graves he's
[1:33:44] going to bring her from that dirty in
[1:33:45] that dimension oh yeah there is in that
[1:33:49] dimension in the theophany bodies but
[1:33:51] they're waiting for the resurrection and
[1:33:53] the rapture when a man when all the dead
[1:33:56] in Christ is a word or dead in Christ
[1:33:57] yeah
[1:33:59] they're dead to the world and the things
[1:34:01] of the world a certain Church's teaching
[1:34:04] oh yeah well you're dead you're that's
[1:34:06] it you're you're totally unconscious and
[1:34:09] you don't know anything that's going on
[1:34:11] I should wait a minute I said there are
[1:34:15] those the dead does know what's going on
[1:34:17] amen we're brothers I said sister I see
[1:34:21] the thing of it is they don't know
[1:34:22] what's going on in this world a man no
[1:34:26] no I said they've gone on to another
[1:34:28] dimension so that's why the Bible says
[1:34:31] those that are dead they know not
[1:34:33] anything period I said but don't let
[1:34:36] don't stop there I should go on ice to
[1:34:38] do a few more verses and maybe a few
[1:34:40] more chapters then you'll understand
[1:34:42] they don't know anything about this
[1:34:43] world a man but they know where they are
[1:34:47] the rich man lifted up his eyes in Hell
[1:34:49] being in torment a man Lazarus that was
[1:34:53] was the rich man saw Lazarus in the
[1:34:56] bosom of Abraham and oh they made fun of
[1:34:59] that when I told him and they saw
[1:35:01] Abraham's Muslim must be some big I said
[1:35:05] but oh yeah oh all the day we went to a
[1:35:08] proposal I said it is big I said what
[1:35:10] was this Muslim I said was his faith
[1:35:12] amen amen so brother it was we got a
[1:35:17] golf looking for that faith in you and
[1:35:19] me that he found in Abraham hey so what
[1:35:22] we're gonna we're gonna go on into as it
[1:35:23] were to the bosom of Abraham what's in
[1:35:25] his bosom I said his heart a man was in
[1:35:28] his heart I said his faith for God sees
[1:35:31] a man but you're saying that they they
[1:35:34] put in a literal interpretation to the
[1:35:37] scriptures they probably want a little I
[1:35:38] mean a physical interpretation all the
[1:35:41] dead don't know anything that's it
[1:35:42] period
[1:35:42] no yes the devil he's hiding their true
[1:35:45] why did the trunk he's hiding from them
[1:35:49] the revelation that they need about the
[1:35:51] resurrection the revelation they made
[1:35:53] about the rapture as he was ideate from
[1:35:55] that rich man and Jesus said you know
[1:35:57] you got to do this do some distance at
[1:35:59] all he didn't wanna do that he believed
[1:36:03] God yeah he kept the commandments from
[1:36:06] his youth like I said how many of us can
[1:36:09] say that you know we've no made no
[1:36:12] mistakes we didn't do this we didn't do
[1:36:14] that oh my goodness but how many feel
[1:36:19] like the rich man to be righteous
[1:36:23] but he was self-righteous Amen just
[1:36:27] think he lifted up his eyes until and
[1:36:29] there was Lazarus the beggar easy of the
[1:36:32] bosom of Abraham hey babe

[1:37:55] we really doing what God wants us to do
[1:37:57] are you just waiting for God to do it
[1:38:00] I'll tell you this most believers are so
[1:38:02] called are waiting for God to do it why
[1:38:07] because they're under the influence of
[1:38:09] the god of this evil age under the
[1:38:11] influence of the devil
[1:38:13] oh yeah yes God said concerning the
[1:38:18] resurrection yeah God said concerning
[1:38:21] the rapture but you just gotta wait oh
[1:38:25] oh thank you yes I fear I feel the same
[1:38:29] way no you say get behind me Satan I'm
[1:38:33] claiming the resurrection now
[1:38:35] I claim in the rapture now name of Jesus
[1:38:39] brothers sister if we don't take that
[1:38:41] right attitude right spirit if we don't
[1:38:43] let that revelation should take control
[1:38:45] of us we're gonna be left like I said
[1:38:50] grace that we're not gonna be here to
[1:38:51] ask the question I thought there was to
[1:38:54] be a rapture oh it already happening you
[1:38:57] didn't know what now I tell you that
[1:38:59] brother the vast majority of believers
[1:39:02] around the world are gonna be left to
[1:39:05] ask that question short yes if the part
[1:39:10] of God said over 50 years ago someone
[1:39:14] said brother Ben and what would you do
[1:39:16] if God asks you to pick a Debray you
[1:39:18] know for the rapture he said it always
[1:39:19] said I might find a dozen what if it was
[1:39:24] like that over 55 when 55 years ago what
[1:39:27] it would be today because people are
[1:39:29] more caught up with the world the things
[1:39:30] of the world today than they were then
[1:39:31] at least they were more spiritually not
[1:39:37] religious spiritual and again another
[1:39:40] time the Father God said there might be
[1:39:42] 200 there might be 500 yeah and he
[1:39:49] caught it down to one in a million
[1:39:52] not many is a that's why you got to be
[1:39:56] on your guard that's why you got to make
[1:39:58] sure you're in the spirit well make your
[1:40:01] calling and election sure how do you do
[1:40:03] that make sure you're in the end they in
[1:40:04] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:07] eating you a man and a man and that
[1:40:10] you're led by the Holy Ghost are not led
[1:40:12] by your own feelings you're not led by
[1:40:14] this up here curse it be those thoughts
[1:40:16] amen
[1:40:17] because this up here is all based on
[1:40:19] human feelings a man but the bride she
[1:40:22] lives by faith in the heart and that's
[1:40:24] based on the revelation of the will of
[1:40:26] God what is God's will for your life
[1:40:30] amen
[1:40:31] what does God want you are you doing
[1:40:33] what God wants you to do
[1:40:34] amen what he wants you to do when he
[1:40:36] wants you to do it where he want you to
[1:40:38] do it he meant by the grace of God it's
[1:40:42] got to be there by the predestinated
[1:40:43] plan and purpose and will of God
[1:40:47] a man she was that why our sisters are
[1:40:50] here from the from America a man
[1:40:53] believing that is to be destinated
[1:40:55] planned purpose of God now why in the
[1:40:59] world would God bring you from there
[1:41:03] to a place called new feeling or
[1:41:07] Newfoundland with its own dictionary its
[1:41:11] own language yeah amazing

[1:45:44] shall not come except there come a
[1:45:48] falling away first and that man of sin
[1:45:52] be revealed the son of perdition and if
[1:45:59] any revelation that we are seen in this
[1:46:02] hour and this age I trusted that the
[1:46:04] brightest seen it for sure
[1:46:05] amen not just all believers but the
[1:46:08] bride is seeing the god of this evil age
[1:46:11] oh yeah we're seeing the influence of
[1:46:14] the god of this evil age oh yeah by
[1:46:17] looking back over 50 odd years I can see
[1:46:19] the influence of the
[1:46:20] this evil age most definitely a man and
[1:46:28] he said let no man deceive you by any
[1:46:31] means for that day shall not come except
[1:46:34] there come a falling away first and that
[1:46:36] man of sin be revealed the son of
[1:46:39] perdition who opposeth and exalteth
[1:46:42] himself above all that is called God or
[1:46:46] that is worshipped so that he as God
[1:46:50] sitteth in the temple of God showing
[1:46:54] himself that He is God
[1:46:56] and he's the god of this evil age oh
[1:46:58] yeah she I preached on it years ago on
[1:47:03] the five I wills of the devil it's found
[1:47:07] in Isaiah he said I will I will I will I
[1:47:11] will be like the Most High yeah and
[1:47:16] there are those that are worshiping the
[1:47:18] devil thinking they're worshiping God
[1:47:22] worshiping the devil thinking they're
[1:47:24] worshiping Christ why he is so close
[1:47:29] that he would deceive the very elect if
[1:47:31] possible and brother that's the very
[1:47:33] elect what about the others they're not
[1:47:36] very elect they're they're trying to
[1:47:39] identify as very late but they're
[1:47:41] deceived God had mercy and it says that
[1:47:49] he sitteth in the temple of God showing
[1:47:51] himself that He is God remember ye not
[1:47:55] that when I was with you I told you
[1:47:58] these things and now he know what with
[1:48:03] older that he might be revealed in his
[1:48:06] time for the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:48:10] already work only he who now letteth
[1:48:14] will let until he be taken out of the
[1:48:18] way amen and then show that wicked be
[1:48:23] revealed whom the Lord shall consume a
[1:48:26] man whom the Lord shall consume with the
[1:48:30] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:48:33] with
[1:48:34] the brightness of his coming in these
[1:48:37] last days amen
[1:48:41] even him who is he going to destroy even
[1:48:45] him whose coming or again it's parousia
[1:48:51] presence whose presence is after the
[1:48:56] working of Satan with all power and
[1:48:59] signs and lying wonders a man such as
[1:49:05] the deception consider it the power of
[1:49:08] God in preaching this god of this evil
[1:49:10] age he references
[1:49:11] second Thessalonians yeah
[1:49:16] such as the deception and it says even
[1:49:21] in whose coming is after the working of
[1:49:23] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[1:49:26] wonders and he said with all
[1:49:29] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:49:31] them that perish because they received
[1:49:34] not didn't say to receive not the truth
[1:49:37] they received not the love of the truth
[1:49:42] well they're identified as all of them
[1:49:45] identified as believers but they don't
[1:49:46] love it
[1:49:48] God help us where is divine love
[1:49:51] do you have divine love in your heart in
[1:49:54] your soul for the truth they do truly
[1:49:57] sincerely like Jesus did yes like the
[1:50:01] apostle's like the prophets you too love
[1:50:03] the word all my anything I love is the
[1:50:07] word Amen anything we love is the reveal
[1:50:13] word amen but it says they perish
[1:50:17] because they received not the love of
[1:50:21] the truth that they might be saved if
[1:50:25] there's anything that God's looking for
[1:50:26] is love divine love is love that shows
[1:50:30] us God in you if you got Islam Amen
[1:50:34] because you go to first Corinthians 13
[1:50:36] again this is absolutely amazing you can
[1:50:39] have all the mysteries you can
[1:50:41] understand this understand that you
[1:50:43] could do this and do this amen
[1:50:45] but if you don't have divine law
[1:50:47] all in vain well we might think we're
[1:50:51] doing something good
[1:50:53] all we're building ourselves up you know
[1:50:55] spiritually but again if you don't have
[1:50:57] divine love you're not you you got the
[1:51:02] you got the letter of the word you got
[1:51:04] the dynamics of the mechanics of the
[1:51:07] word but not the dynamics the dynamics
[1:51:09] is divine love a man can love projects
[1:51:14] grace grace faith a man so anything in
[1:51:20] God's looking for in the revelation of
[1:51:22] his word in the revelation of your your
[1:51:24] testimony your light it's divine love
[1:51:26] oh yeah no matter much why I believe the
[1:51:31] word I believe the message yes so does
[1:51:32] the devil but he don't have divine law
[1:51:34] and he seed don't had divine law his
[1:51:38] children don't have divine love
[1:51:40] they might ever love but not divine laws
[1:51:43] or the prophet of God said that or said
[1:51:46] you can have love he said but it's easy
[1:51:47] it's just just ordinary common he says
[1:51:50] not divine Anthony got divine look my
[1:51:56] God have mercy I told you there's not
[1:52:00] much love today as it was 30 years ago
[1:52:03] not love today as it was 50 years ago no
[1:52:07] not by any means the love is not
[1:52:11] therefore the word the love is not
[1:52:14] therefore for the sons and daughters of
[1:52:16] God no not like it was what like I said
[1:52:21] when I first come to this word this
[1:52:23] message is this amazing so different now
[1:52:27] that people are too net too natural yeah
[1:52:32] they're just you just ordinary humans
[1:52:35] but not only go Schumann's if your Holy
[1:52:38] Ghost you got the Holy Ghost in yarn you

[1:59:22] and pleasure in unrighteousness or
[1:59:25] apostasy a man not the true Holy Ghost
[1:59:30] revelation of the word but a false
[1:59:32] interpretation thereof a man should they
[1:59:35] had pleasure in such unrighteousness it
[1:59:39] is unrighteous we
[1:59:40] god amen grace of God bear with me I'll
[1:59:49] try Oh Matthew but the time' grace
[1:59:58] didn't realize there was this long i'll
[2:00:04] just give you a couple of quotes again
[2:00:08] just as your natural life
[2:00:12] your natural traits is ended down from
[2:00:16] the natural bleeding or breeding rather
[2:00:18] of your father so is the Spirit of God
[2:00:22] that was predestinated before the
[2:00:25] foundation of the world and when the
[2:00:27] entire Word of God he said incomplete
[2:00:30] was added up and an human body called
[2:00:34] Jesus Christ in there God made me pay
[2:00:38] for my sins in him amen he laid down his
[2:00:43] life for us Jesus he said then he raised
[2:00:47] me up with him in the resurrection
[2:00:50] praise the Lord if I died with him I
[2:00:54] raised up again with him amen and now we
[2:00:58] are seated with him he said with power
[2:01:01] and authority over every devil
[2:01:04] Amen oh yeah you got the power you got
[2:01:07] the authority over Satan and all of his
[2:01:10] demons all he said if you could only
[2:01:13] believe he said what God has given but
[2:01:16] if you're not seated there you don't
[2:01:18] have it and if you're seated there he
[2:01:20] said don't believe and are afraid to
[2:01:22] move he said you'll never use it but he
[2:01:25] said if you are seated you will use it
[2:01:28] if you're seated in Christ you're going
[2:01:31] to use that word and he said for you are
[2:01:34] ordained to do what you do by brother
[2:01:38] the thing of it is the natural traits
[2:01:41] and more preeminent sometimes in the
[2:01:44] spiritual people are more caught up with
[2:01:47] their natural feelings and and and
[2:01:50] wishes and desires than the spiritual
[2:01:53] father we got by grace a man to
[2:01:57] surrender to the leadership of the Holy
[2:01:59] Ghost
[2:01:59] because when the devil is going to move
[2:02:01] in the natural the Holy Ghost is going
[2:02:03] to move in the spiritual get behind me
[2:02:05] Satan a man you need to use that thought
[2:02:08] sometimes a thought in your mind because
[2:02:10] Satan is working in the mind a man make
[2:02:14] sure you got the word to give the devil
[2:02:16] a minute knowing that Rex you know would
[2:02:19] make sure you got the revelation so that
[2:02:21] you'll know when when it's Satan him and
[2:02:24] when it's not God because a lot of
[2:02:27] people you know Satan is there and they
[2:02:28] think well it's God know you better be
[2:02:30] careful so closer to see the very like
[2:02:33] that possible oh yeah he's gonna be
[2:02:35] dropping thoughts in your head and he's
[2:02:37] gonna try to get down what's he trying
[2:02:38] to do control your spirit and then to
[2:02:41] control it control your soul but if
[2:02:44] you're born again for Satan out of the
[2:02:45] soul code we're born in sin well God
[2:02:48] comes in and a man if our Satan out of
[2:02:51] the soul a man grace of God and he take
[2:02:56] what it is and he said he's on the
[2:02:59] throne in yourself yeah and Satan is
[2:03:03] there oh yeah then he controls your
[2:03:06] spirit then he's trying to influence you
[2:03:08] in your soul but if it's the devil the
[2:03:12] Spirit is gonna come with the word out
[2:03:13] of your soul get behind me Satan any man
[2:03:18] brother let's be careful my grace
[2:03:22] he said notice how beautiful the
[2:03:24] scripture tied themselves together in
[2:03:27] every age the scripture is tied together
[2:03:30] in every age word to word the word to
[2:03:34] finally if the fullness of the Godhead
[2:03:36] bodily in the bright it was all the word
[2:03:39] down through the prophets and in Christ
[2:03:41] if the fullness of the Word made flesh
[2:03:43] to redeem us spiritually a man but now
[2:03:47] it goes onward onward onward to now it's
[2:03:50] the word in us a man to redeem us
[2:03:52] physically amen
[2:03:55] he came and we were born to gain insight
[2:03:57] now he's going to come and give us a new
[2:03:59] body by the grace of God amen
[2:04:03] so he said notice how beautiful the
[2:04:05] scripture tie them sounds like
[2:04:07] in every age and he should notice now he
[2:04:10] said in the church world he said would
[2:04:12] not have the Word of God to rule over
[2:04:14] them will we have the word to rule over
[2:04:16] us concerning you concerning your your
[2:04:20] your life your relationship with others
[2:04:23] your job no matter what it is is the
[2:04:26] word in control he said the word to rule
[2:04:30] over them the Word of God and they
[2:04:32] accepted a murderer they would not have
[2:04:35] the word in Jesus day he said they
[2:04:37] accepted a murderer Barabbas and he said
[2:04:41] what did this do it exalted Satan the
[2:04:44] god of this evil age exalted him to the
[2:04:47] place that he's always wanted now he
[2:04:50] said listen for Satan is not spoke of as
[2:04:53] a God of any other age but this age and
[2:04:56] he was a spoke of the god of the age of
[2:04:58] Noah and he said he wasn't a smoke of
[2:05:01] the god of the age of Moses or the age
[2:05:03] of Elijah but this evil age he said
[2:05:07] don't miss it he said he is the god of
[2:05:10] this evil age worshipped now listen
[2:05:15] who are the people worshiping he is the
[2:05:20] god of this evil age he said worshipped
[2:05:23] by millions and billions of people and
[2:05:27] they don't know it they think they're
[2:05:33] worshipping Jehovah but they're
[2:05:36] worshipping Satan
[2:05:39] thinking that E is God such as his
[2:05:42] deception yeah just think about the one
[2:05:47] that betrayed Jesus Judas just thinking
[2:05:53] about the one that betrayed Jesus
[2:05:54] brother and in in the in the in the
[2:05:57] scriptures the Matthew Mark Luke and
[2:06:00] John we took we find nothing negative
[2:06:02] vote about him own only the worry to
[2:06:05] save Jesus he betrayed Jesus until
[2:06:08] disciples didn't know she was Thomas so
[2:06:12] close to had deceived the very light
[2:06:14] well he was there he was part of the
[2:06:17] part of the disciples Jesus anointed the
[2:06:19] disciples the glutton
[2:06:20] pray and heal the sick raise the dead
[2:06:22] and they all come back and says oh yeah
[2:06:24] we did this we did that and again
[2:06:26] there's nothing negative about you Judas
[2:06:28] nothing anywho when Jesus said one of
[2:06:33] you bid will betray me they were me is
[2:06:37] it me Lord
[2:06:39] is it me see it was so close
[2:06:44] and Jesus said well he said it's gonna
[2:06:47] be this person then Jesus turned to
[2:06:49] Judas and he's nice what you do do
[2:06:51] quickly no and there wasn't there was
[2:06:55] nothing negative about the relationship
[2:06:57] Jesus told him what to do there wasn't
[2:07:02] an anointing there before he got up and
[2:07:04] left and went and did it but it's
[2:07:08] amazing that he was interred in to enter
[2:07:11] into it that he was just he was
[2:07:13] deceiving there all the other disciples
[2:07:16] this is absolutely amazing and again
[2:07:20] it's proving what the scriptures that
[2:07:22] were reading is proving what the proud
[2:07:24] of God is talking about the God of this
[2:07:26] evil age it's so close who had deceived
[2:07:31] a very elect impossible no doubt the
[2:07:35] disciples were surprised we would think
[2:07:39] maybe would be Peter I like what brother
[2:07:42] brother George Smith brought out and we
[2:07:44] look forward to our brother coming back
[2:07:46] and finishing this sermon on Acts the
[2:07:48] book of Acts he finished with acts 18 I
[2:07:51] think a man and he was talking about
[2:07:53] Paul that God chose Paul as the
[2:07:57] messenger yet Paul was guilty of killing
[2:07:59] Christians imprisoning Christians oh
[2:08:03] yeah and yet he was he was he was the
[2:08:07] son of God
[2:08:09] amazing yeah he was the Messenger of God
[2:08:11] he was the messenger to the aged brother
[2:08:15] and we would consider well Lord after
[2:08:18] all we read in the Bible but Peter and
[2:08:20] you chose him to be the messenger of the
[2:08:24] day of Pentecost yeah he was the one God
[2:08:28] chose and yet went and you wouldn't when
[2:08:31] Jesus was fellowship with Peter at one
[2:08:33] point there Jesus
[2:08:34] Peter made a remark and Jesus said get
[2:08:36] thee behind me Satan yeah and even after
[2:08:39] the resurrection Jesus came back Peter
[2:08:41] lovest thou me more than these three
[2:08:44] times he was challenging Peters
[2:08:46] relationship with him yeah we had would
[2:08:53] he challenge yours mine god help us
[2:08:58] listen he says Satan is not spoke of as
[2:09:02] the God of any other age but this age
[2:09:04] and he wasn't spoke of the god of the
[2:09:07] age of Noah or Moses or Elijah don't
[2:09:10] miss it
[2:09:11] he is the god of this evil age worshiped
[2:09:14] by millions and billions of people and
[2:09:16] they don't know it yeah he's he's
[2:09:22] worshiped by Jews Christians Muslims
[2:09:24] cetera all other faiths and religions is
[2:09:27] Satan notices to Satan not called the
[2:09:30] God of any other age but this age it was
[2:09:33] his ambition to be like God from the
[2:09:35] very beginning a man he goes didn't want
[2:09:39] to go in some scriptures and he said are
[2:09:41] there fallen from heaven o Lucifer son
[2:09:43] of the morning
[2:09:44] however cast down to the ground which
[2:09:47] did weaken the nation's for thou hast
[2:09:49] said in thine heart I will ascend into
[2:09:51] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[2:09:54] stars of God and I was set also upon the
[2:09:57] Mount of the congregation in the sight
[2:09:59] of the door yeah I will I will I will
[2:10:02] they may be like God and he would be
[2:10:07] worshipped as God and he is
[2:10:10] thank God for the revelation to be on
[2:10:13] our guard amen he said it was Satan's
[2:10:18] ambition to be worshipped play God and
[2:10:20] he took two-thirds of the stars of
[2:10:22] heaven ascended himself above the stars
[2:10:25] preached to them and seen two-thirds of
[2:10:28] them and now he's ready with his careful
[2:10:31] selected educated bride by his own
[2:10:34] knowledge all painted up in his deceit
[2:10:37] of big buildings big denominations
[2:10:41] paints of knowledge theology smart
[2:10:44] intellectual educated to deceive the
[2:10:47] whole
[2:10:47] and become a god that's what he's done
[2:10:50] all heading up into the person of the
[2:10:53] Antichrist which has already cloned the
[2:10:56] Vicar of God by his worldly loving
[2:10:59] scientific bride all dressed up in pop
[2:11:02] of intellectual religious education amen
[2:11:07] grace grace grace I'll finish it right
[2:11:13] there with this he mentions second
[2:11:19] Thessalonians 2 what we just read he
[2:11:23] said notice they are they the people
[2:11:25] exalt him above all that's called God
[2:11:28] they exalted the devil and he said
[2:11:33] doesn't he says 2nd Thessalonians say
[2:11:35] they would do it and the authority of a
[2:11:38] denominational church the people
[2:11:40] believing these are their denomination
[2:11:42] more than they believe God and God is
[2:11:45] the word but they'll believe their
[2:11:47] denominational Creed above the word
[2:11:49] which exalts him above all that's called
[2:11:53] God and there's only one God that's the
[2:11:55] word all that's called God so he as God
[2:11:59] is sitting in the Church of God proving
[2:12:03] that he is God because he got the people
[2:12:05] worshiping him amen
[2:12:08] and that says God is the word but he
[2:12:12] exalts him above all that is called God
[2:12:14] a man and there's only one God that is
[2:12:18] the word amen and he said the god of
[2:12:23] this age has exalted himself above the
[2:12:26] truth vindicated word above all that's
[2:12:30] called God so that he has God sits in
[2:12:32] the temple of God with authority and he
[2:12:35] is priest for it oh let the people God
[2:12:38] let the people see the deception he is
[2:12:42] praised for it and solemnly believed by
[2:12:44] the people of this evil age now do you
[2:12:47] see the God and his servants of this
[2:12:50] evil age amen
[2:12:53] he says he is making a better world for
[2:12:56] them to live in by his not by his
[2:12:59] knowledge apart from the never failing
[2:13:01] word of god he is making a better world
[2:13:04] for man to live in and ignoring the
[2:13:06] promise of God that the only time the
[2:13:09] world will be will be fit to live in is
[2:13:11] in the Millennium he said you know my
[2:13:14] opinion he's made a better world to sin
[2:13:17] in instead of Libya and that is the
[2:13:20] truth amen yeah it's a better world to
[2:13:25] sin in order just disbelieve God just
[2:13:27] believe the word than it is to believe
[2:13:30] the word amen
[2:13:32] why because to believe the word the
[2:13:35] truth the whole truth nothing but the
[2:13:37] truth you're gonna live a different life
[2:13:38] than what's out there in the world
[2:13:39] you're gonna be totally separated from
[2:13:42] the world and the things of the world
[2:13:44] and and brother it will if you're really
[2:13:47] living it from your soul it'll separate
[2:13:49] you from the people of the world all
[2:13:51] there's there's few that would would
[2:13:53] keep you as friends and so on but other
[2:13:55] but for the most part no separation
[2:13:58] because why because you're just your
[2:14:01] nature it's just too uncomfortable for
[2:14:02] them your thoughts and your ideas they
[2:14:06] know they can't convince you of this
[2:14:08] they can't you persuade you of that no
