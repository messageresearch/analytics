church family there to rally around her lord to lift her up in prayer or may you just grant our grace especially this day we pray in jesus christ's name we ask amen and then god bless you if you turn your scriptures to genesis chapter 2 this morning genesis chapter 2 immense nice to have a full church here seems like everybody's back that was sick almost got brother chad back came in sister rebecca back in the kids and then brother vaishal's back and then it's good to have good to have everyone here as brother matt said when one's gone we miss him amen amen brother ellie's not here this morning praying god's grace to him sister elise i think is out as well sister priscilla perhaps but uh trusting god will be with them amen amen genesis 2 verse 18 says in the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him and help meet for him amen may god bless his word you may be seated this morning and then we want to continue our series and that kingdom come and we want to take a title of the bride's character test amen and we're starting to transition now this will be the the first service where we kind of start to focus on the sisters especially amen and so we want to start with this this uh this title of the bride's character test amen now when we were focused on the men we showed that when god pulled back from humanity he put man into the position of authority amen he made the man the head over marriage in the marriage he made the the the men the head over the women and men don't that doesn't mean that any man is head over any women by any means a man a man is if he's unmarried is head of no one except himself and if he's in the church and he's given authority then he has spiritual authority over people but he absolutely is not the head over every woman i mean i remember we were in one place and a man tried to tell my wife what to do and she said you'll have to talk to my husband about that he said you need to listen to me because i'm a man and she said i absolutely do not i need to listen to my husband amen so there's a limit to a man's folk to immense a man's ministry a man's authority if we could put it that way and that is to his own household and then if he is put in a position of authority in the church then he has spiritual authority but he still doesn't have physical authority over a woman amen and we see on the on the flip side of that then is that a woman can never take spiritual authority over a man there's no position anywhere in the scripture where you will see a woman take a spiritual authority over men you'll see women that are prophetesses but that is not a position of spiritual authority it's a position of being a microphone for god and she has to say thus saith the lord but she does not preach she does not teach she just is a microphone for the lord amen so we see no place where a woman takes spiritual authority and if we want to type it to the bride in christ we never take authority over christ do we amen the easy thing for our sisters to do is say if we wouldn't do it to christ then we're not supposed to do it in this life does it because you are the bride type if we don't do it to god then we're not supposed to do it to other people as well amen that's that's the the easy way for our sisters to see that so a woman is never to be an authority unless she's under authority herself and then under that authority some authority is then given to her for a certain space or a certain part of the family or finances or whatever it might be she is given authority but she does not take authority to herself of her own accord amen now we see life isn't perfect we see broken marriages i come from a broken home where my mom was forced to step into the roles of a man in terms of a provider and a caretaker in these different things and you have to do it out of necessity but it's not something you take under yourself and there's always a price to pay man there's a price to pay for her there's a price for us to pay his kids and that's not in god's perfect will but we're in a fallen world and so we see we get into situations and things where we have to do things that maybe we wouldn't have we wouldn't do if things were in their perfect order amen but we're in an imperfect world we're in a fallen world with fallen people and so there are things that we have to deal with that are maybe a little less than than what god would want us to do but life brings us those situations at times amen but when we start talking about authority and we talk about somebody that that is that is is in authority over another person a lot of times we see this picture painted and you'll certainly see it in the media these days with the focus on cults and these things where they paint a picture of a christian woman that is oppressed i meant she is suppressed she's down trodden she shackled the perfect men she's under fallen leadership and even they are abused amen and i'm not saying those things don't happen by any means they do and we don't want to minimize that but we know that that is not the position that they were intended to occupy is to be under that sort of of a ministry or of a man by any means amen the position and and and the grace of a woman under the body of christ is one of glory it's one of beauty it's one of purity dedication and holiness amen and that's the picture that i want to paint for our sisters as we we go through this amen it's our human nature to dwell on the negative amen on the difficulties on the trials that we face but as we go through here as we start to preach for our sister's sake amen i want a picture of what god sees that you're going to be by foreknowledge and by predestination amen about where he wants you to be by his word amen and how that looks in the life you're living today amen we want to apply the word so we can get word results amen if we're real believers we want our lives to line up with the word and not just line up with it up in our heads but we want to line up in the way we live our lives day by day amen amen so we want to go back to the beginning to see where we are and then because we don't so often what we can look back is is where we were and where we're going but we want to really find out where we are and how we got here because if we can see how that happened then we can see how satan's going to keep trying to affect our lives today because satan is always coming at us from the same way he might change the way it looks but he's got the same thing and he's trying to separate us from one thing and that's the word of god amen so if we take it back to genesis 2 and there was the opening scripture we read and it says in the lord god said it's not good that man should be alone i will make him and help meet for him now i want to remind you i've said it before that this is not a help mate amen it's misquoted so often but this is a help meet and that means it is a helper a companion that is suited specifically to the man amen it's not a slave it's not a servant it's not something that answers to the man this is an equal partner under the perfect situation that they had in eden amen this is a compliment to the men if we could put it that way amen and the driving reason why god created women is that he says it's not good for man to be alone amen and that was an echo of the desire of god's heart was that he looked at himself and said i don't want to be alone i don't like being alone i have great power i have great authority but i'm looking for a relationship i'm looking for family i'm looking for intimacy and i don't have that with the angels they're created to serve the angels were created for one thing and that was to serve but he says i'm looking for something else and that that desire was echoed in the man and so god's seen what's in that man he says it's not good for man to be alone just as it's not good for me to be alone so what he's doing is he's bringing out the desire of that of that man's inward heart amen so in the in a perfect world in eden we had a woman that was created to complement a man now that doesn't mean to say nice things about a man now don't let that stop your sisters from saying nice things about your man but it to compliment means to complete to bring to perfection and to enhance or improve so this was something that was going to make man's life better it was going to make creation better it was going to make their life on earth better by bringing this out of the man amen we talked about compatibility last service remember and we said there's only one thing that makes you compatible with the body of christ and that's the holy spirit because by one spirit we're baptized into this body amen and we looked at eden originally and you see the man and the wife and the wife the men and the woman are perfectly compatible they're in harmony they're in one accord there's no rancor there's no argument there's no fear there's no distrust or anything why because they come from the same source don't they as we continue in verse 21 it says in the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh there instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man therefore shall a man leave his mother and his father and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now i love how what it's saying here because the scripture is telling us men it says your wife is worth leaving mom and dad right life is better married than single right life is better than getting then staying in your your basement or your room and mom cooks all of your meals and you have everything made for you and you have lots of money and lots of toys and lots of this and lots of that it says no no there's a reason to leave and it's because that wife is going to make your life better amen when you get the second half of you then life is better right now that's the opposite of what the world is trying to paint today isn't it right there's there's a focus on singleness today there's a focus on taking the family out of the picture and doing what trying to build the economy trying to make more money for us trying to get us out of this big tax debt that we're in right amen but in a perfect world you're the two are one and he says that's where you want to be is with the with the other part that makes you one that fulfills you that completes you that brings you to perfection amen it says and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed now what a contrast that is to today amen where today they know they're naked and they're still not ashamed amen we've come to the place where right is wrong and wrong is right black is is white and white is black amen we've come to the place where we've complete completely switched the way things god said they were supposed to be and what's right and what's not amen now as i said before as we set this proper foundation for the sisters the men and the women were created co-equal here under perfection there is no differentiation of authority between the man and the woman amen that's where they were but we know that the woman sinned and by listening to the serpent what did she do she considered an opinion that was contrary to the word that was the start where she stopped and listened and we've read the quotes many times and brother braham says don't stop and listen right don't have the conversation in the first place don't open the door to the one that's giving you something contrary to the word as soon as you identify it as contrary to the word close the door say we're not even having this conversation but somehow he got an opening with eve didn't he and so they started to talk this over and fellowship over time and what happened was he changed her mind amen and over time that consideration she gave him turned into unbelief and then she took matters into her own hands and we know what the original sim was amen and when she did that she dropped herself out of that position of co-equal god judged her for it and he says you are no longer co-equal because you're the one that sinned amen now i want you to grasp that what i just said does not make her lesser amen she dropped out of her position of co-equal authority but that dog did not make her lesser it did not make her less than a man and it did not make her less in the eyes of god we see that nowhere in scripture all he said was you're no longer under the same authority right now you're under a different authority and the man is going to be the head of you amen she lost her position and in being deceived and doing what god told her not to do she effectively took herself out of a position of authority but it didn't make her lesser and that's often the problem we see is that we make the women a lesser thing because of the original sin and god didn't say you're lesser he just said you're not in the same position you were that's what we've got to remember as men is that our sisters are not lesser but they are in a different position and that's all there is to it and it's not of our doing it's of god's doing if we can put it that way amen why because adam wasn't deceived and paul says it clearly in first timothy 2 he says and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so this is why she was out was because she was deceived he fooled her now adam didn't do what he did with eve out of deception because he did it out of love amen brother brown we've read the quotes where he says and quickly adam took her to himself so that what god wouldn't destroy her because now she was a part of him in every way possibly man he put his seat inside of her because god wouldn't just wouldn't destroy that righteous seed amen he took himself to her and he saved her and it was that savior attribute that god recognized when he put that man in authority over the woman amen and we see this in the scripture because adam took the place not because he was better but because he loved her and god was understanding that he would be considerate and loving and everything else if he was willing to give up eternal life then why wouldn't he be a right leader for everything else i mean if you're willing to give up the one thing that makes you a god then he's trusting that the man is going to continue down that path and the way he treats that wife the way he treats that woman is going to be reflected in sacrificial love for the rest of his life amen so we see that the driving factor here for the man being put in authority was because man showed the character of love and salvation to that woman and then he put himself with her out of love and god says i'm going to trust you to be in authority by love for the rest of time amen it says in in romans 5 14 it says nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them who had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come in the amplified it says adam was a type or a prefigure of the one who was to come why adam was christ-like in his transgression because what he took on sin for the sake of his bride amen now adam was imperfect when he did it because he broke the word of god when he did it but he broke the word with his eyes wide open for the sake of his wife christ on the other hand was perfect and he had no sin he did not break the word but rather he came and he took our sin on him and in doing so he paid the price so adam was a type and christ was the fulfillment of perfect love if we could put it that way amen adam was the type christ was a fulfillment now we're not going to get into marriage for quite some time i don't know if we ever will in this in the series i don't feel that's necessarily where we want to go but we see here that the christ-like man is motivated by love in all things when it comes to authority amen that love is supposed to be the motivating factor it's not for selfishness it's not for things that we want but rather it's for the benefit of those that are under our authority and we covered this when we spoke about the men was that when you do things it is supposed to be for the benefit of those that are beneath you not for the benefit just of yourself amen so what we have to ask ourselves what does our motive mean if we're in authority and we're doing something if we're insisting on something or if we're holding the line is it out of love or is it out of selfish motivation is it to make our life easier or is it to make those that are under our authority lives better amen we want to question our motives every time so when we what we have here is somebody that's trying to what help and support the woman so the question is how are you supporting her and how are you helping her because a lot of times we have a certain idea of what we believe the woman wants and needs and we should by the word of god but so often what we're ignoring is what the woman says she needs because that's not something that we are ready to supply just yet and that's really the character test for men especially in marriage is will you supply what your wife has needs of even if you don't think that's necessary amen i can speak from my own marriage that my wife was asking for things for emotional connection these different things and i wasn't willing to give it to her because i didn't need it the way she needed it but my role is to provide for what she needs not to provide just for what i have need of so i had to do what i had to humble myself i had to bring myself to a place where i would meet her emotional needs and something that was very uncomfortable for me to do most of you know i'm not a particularly emotional people unless a person unless i'm in church or unless my kids are being born that's where my two emotions are right and so when it when a wife is asking you to connect emotionally and you're not particularly emotional what's that that's a real stretch isn't it right and so there's going to be things in every marriage and every man's life is where you're going to have to stretch because your wife is saying i need this and you're saying but i don't have it so where are you going to go get it you got to go to the one that provides amen you got to go to jehovah gyra you've got to humble yourself and say well just because it's not natural to me doesn't mean i'm not going to do it she has needs and i'm supposed to be supplying those things amen when we go back to genesis now we want to see where god places the woman in general after the fall he says now unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now remember the command was given be fruitful and multiply and what eve was trying to do was be fruitful and multiply right she was trying to be fruitful multiply she was trying to bring forth life and satan convinced her that if he did it she did it his way then she would get that and in addition to that she'd have other things she would be like god when she did it amen and so because of that god judges childbirth for the lady for the woman right and this is a reflection of what he's judging her based on what she did he's making what she did now very difficult he's making it a pain for her to go through what she was trying to bring forth he's greatly multiplied it from what it would have been otherwise right and what he's doing is he's compounded now the judgment by giving her a natural desire a craving for intimacy with that husband so he's put the woman between a rock and a hard place because he's given her a desire for physical intimacy and then the fruit of that physical intimacy is going to cause her pain and hardship right and not just from the birth but she's gonna have 18 years probably a pain in hardship raising those kids with a husband so what he's done is he's made he's given her a desire to do what she did that she shouldn't have done and then he's get he's judged it by causing that to have a painful outcome amen it's an eternal reminder of what the original sin was it's amazing to me that people think the original sin was eating some sort of fruit off of an apple because we never see a judgment on a tree do we we we see a judgment on the things that cause the problem in the first place amen and so we don't see it on the mouth we don't see it on the hand do we we see it in the place where the original sin was amen so god judged that part of the original sin but her greatest loss was not the pain it was what that lost position of co-equal authority with the man now she's put under headship that is flawed and that is the greatest struggle and the greatest trial and that is the greatest character test of our sisters today is to sit under flawed authority because every man in here ought to be able to raise his hands and say i am flawed authority amen whether it's in ministry whether it's in fatherhood whether it's in husbandhood whether it's it's a position in the church we are flawed men amen and if the women haven't haven't grasped that by now they're going to grasp it very shortly amen we are flawed men and that they're called to be under our headship and as long as we are here in these bodies of sin that never changes a woman never takes authority over a man amen that's where god has put it amen now for a woman that's single because we're talking about a man and a wife right a woman that is single she has no husband and so god has still put her under headship and that's her father right and we see in numbers 30 that a young woman as long as she is under the roof of her father she's under the headship of her father and he has covenant authority now i want you to grasp what authority means because authority doesn't mean you get to force authority means you can break that's what we see in the scriptures i can't force my wife to do anything my wife still has has free will right i can't force my wife to have kids i can't force my wife to stay home i can't force my wife to clean the house or do any of these things she has to do it of her own free will amen we're not brute beasts we don't go around with a whip cracking it and saying you must do this you must do that that's not what authority under god's word is supposed to look like right we're supposed to lead and we're supposed to support and we're supposed to serve that's what authority is really supposed to look like in its greatest elements right so we don't force them but what we can do is we can break amen and what we can do is we can break what they commit to do as soon as we hear it and so we saw that a father has covenant authority for his daughter so if she said i vowed to god to to go around the world seven times preaching the gospel then he could say no i'm going to break that vow god's not going to hold you to that because as soon as i hear i'm telling you that's not the right thing to do and i'm putting a stop to it or it can be something as simple as where she's going or or she's committed to a missions trip or or she's going to fast for 40 days or whatever it could be whatever that that daughter committed to then as soon as he heard it he could break it and that's the same authority that a husband has for his wife as if she says i prayed about it and i feel led to do this and he says sorry i can't allow you to do that because it's going to impact the family too much it's going to impact me too much it's going to cause problems it's not going to have the benefit you're looking for sorry i'm going to put a stop to it husbands have covenant authority and fathers have covenant authority over young women that are still under their house amen so again we don't force them to do things but we can keep you from doing something that's really the authority that a man has amen but i want to come back to this idea of child bearing because in the old testament especially the focus was on that be fruitful and multiply command and god gave it to adam god gave it to noah god gave it to abraham god gave to jacob and then by moses god gave it all the way to the children of israel in leviticus and after that we don't hear anything it was a command given and god says look i've told the children of israel to do this i don't ever have to mention again and we never see it ever again in scripture he gives it in leviticus moses gives it to the children of israel and after that we don't see it at all we don't see it in the new testament ever and all we see then is israel was trying to grow into the great nation that god told them to be right when they were looking for a natural kingdom a natural land and they were going to be a great people with with the as the sands of the sea and these different things right all they were focused on was having children so that's what the women were focused on back then they were focused on bringing the fulfillment of the promise of god to the israelites and so a woman's role back then was purely to get married and have children the value of a woman was determined by is she married and once she's married does she have children and it was really that simple that's all they looked to the women for was marriage and children right now we look around in in the church today and we see that obviously that's not the only thing we value our sisters for right but in those days that's all they were seeking and we see it in sarah we see it in rachel and we see it within hannah and these women are struggling and striving to have children right and if they didn't have it it was what a reproach to them it was a slight against their character and their value in society and even to their own husbands if they couldn't bring forth life because that was the overarching commandment was we've got to be a great nation and we can only do it if the women bring forth children right so the goal was have a lot of kids and again that's really difficult on the women because that's the thing that god cursed was he says it's going to be very painful for you to have children so they've got a desire to do it but it's bringing pain in their lives and so your whole value is based on something that's painful to you amen i will tell you this sisters nothing's changed today your value is going to be based on something that's very painful for you to do it's going to be difficult for you to do us men have a load to carry and you women have a load to carry and it is not an easy thing to do amen so we see here what the woman is supposed to do she's supposed to take what the man gives her and she's supposed to magnify it glorify it and manifest it amen so what she takes is she takes a seed and she turns it into what a beautiful baby right she takes one thing and she turns it into something much bigger and greater and then it grows and it manifests she takes the potential she takes the vision she takes the dna of that man and she turns it into a into a reality right she's a magnifier she's a glorifier she takes something and she makes it into something better than it was when it was given and then even if you look into proverbs 31 in these different areas we see the woman is both gifted and positioned to take something that is raw something that is relatively unimproved and she turns it into something amazing amen you bring in the groceries men and then she turns it into what a wonderful meal you bring in cloth and she turns it into clothing you bring in this and she turns it into that you buy a house and she turns it into a home right all of these things what she's doing she's taking what you give her and she makes it into something better and then she's a glorifier she is something that is supposed to be the glory the scripture says a woman is the glory of her husband amen that's so when we look at the women when we look at our wives they are supposed to be a glory for us and if something's a glory that's not something we're going to be putting down is it it's something we're supposed to be elevating something that we're supposed to be encouraging something that we're supposed to be growing something that we're supposed to be putting a lot of effort into because that's our glory amen our glory is not ourselves our glory is our wife right so there's a lot that that goes into this amen but in the in the nation of israel that woman was absolutely outside of any spiritual authority the only place we'll ever see a woman with anything spiritual in that sense is the prophetesses and you'll see it with miriam and you'll you'll see it with with the judges and whatnot but even then we'll get deeper into that later they're still under headship they're still under headship when they do it they don't get to run around and do whatever they want amen a prophet or a prophetess is one thing and they're a microphone they say thus saith the lord and then they speak and then they don't say anything else of their own amen they're just a microphone amen a commentary i read on this had this to say it said in ancient judaism the woman only had rights in the home and even that was very limited the man had authority over his wife and daughters establishing their activities and their relationships women were passed from the control of her father to the control of her husband with little or no say in the matter they were sold for a dow resettlement usually when they came of age now like i said you can look around the church today and you can see that things have definitely changed amen i'm not selling my daughter to anybody because they couldn't afford her amen but what we don't pass women around like cattle right we don't just move them from our house to somebody else's house and then they have spiritual roles in the church we have sisters that play we have sisters that sing we have sisters that worship amen we have sisters that teach in the sunday school and these different things they have a role in the church amen and they have what not spiritual authority but they have spiritual impact in a way they were never allowed to in the old testament right the women were separated from the men for most of most of the time in the in the old temples they had a women's car court and then they had the the inner and then they had the outer court so the women were between the inner court outer court and the inner court they were better than a gentile and a money lender but they weren't necessarily the same as a man that that's where they were societally that had nothing to do with god we don't see a woman's cord in the original temple did you know that it was never there but under men they took it and they ran with it and they made it way worse than it had to be right god never intended to separate them that way but men did that for whatever reason right but we don't see it in the original temple so what happened was they took the word of god and then they started adding men's doctrine to it to cause what a separation and so for 4 000 years women are defined by are they married and do they have children and if they didn't they were not valued right and it was a slight to them it was a slight to their family it was a reproach to their family if they weren't married and having babies for four thousand years and then christ comes along and he starts walking around and he fulfills the law and he pays the penalty of the sin that he caused in the in the garden of eden and all of a sudden we see things change like i said now he commissions us and he says what go you into all the world and preach the gospel and all of a sudden we're here to bring forth spiritual children not just natural children now don't think for a second that this lets the sisters off the hook there is still a primary role for a woman and it is still in the house and the scripture fulfills it and paul and paul confirms it to us as well and the prophet said it as well okay you still have a primary place but you are not limited only to that and what happens is jesus comes and all of a sudden gets what he's doing he's inviting women out of their traditional roles right he's got women that are following him around from town to town and city to city and what are they they are spiritually minded women that are what supporting the role of that outreach because guess what there are things that women can talk to women about that men can't easily talk to men about and as we start to go and we start to seek people and we start to try and bring souls into the kingdom now women can have a role in in mentorship and in fellowship and even in witness right they can never join the priesthood that's never going to open up for them you can never have a woman ministering teaching admonishing men it's never going to happen it's never in the scripture but they can still have a role in bringing souls into the kingdom amen and we've got sisters in this very church that have witnessed the people and brought them to church and have done what they've furthered the gospel in the kingdom of god amen there's a place that you're allowed to take it's just not over men but you still have a place now in the kingdom and jesus does this and jesus goes to women he talks to women and he has women following him in his ministry and that was never allowed before that was never a part there so we see what an expansion of the role of women to allow them to have a spiritual impact in the church and that's where we want you to see today is that you are no longer just valued for being married and having kids right there is something else you can do and like i said we see it here we see a tremendous gift in our in our sisters here for singing how many singers how many great singers do we have in this church that are gifted not just to sing in the pews but to come up and what be anointed by the holy spirit to what caused the cause the presence of god to come ever closer to us amen it's something that we value and we cherish right can you imagine the old days we'd have missed that right we wouldn't have had that why because christ has come and he's what he's put aside the old covenant now we're under a new covenant and there's a freedom that allows them to be a part of things that they weren't before amen now the perfect way and the perfect example is still through marriage that's what he started with he started with marriage didn't he started with a man and a woman and they were they were husband and wife amen so that is the perfect way that's the type of christ and the bride i mean that's the place you're always going to find the perfect types and it's the perfect shadow of what we are with christ amen so i do believe that the perfect example for a christian is still to be married right but that doesn't mean you have to be married to be a christian it doesn't mean you have to be married to be a true believer for a woman it doesn't mean you have to have kids or have a husband to be a true believer paul shows us this very clearly and we'll start to we're going to cover the single sisters and these different things as we go through amen but marriage will grow you strengthen you humble you cause character growth in ways that you will never get if you're not married because why as iron sharpness iron if you're in the house with somebody on a regular basis their flaws and your flaws it's going to bring things to light very quickly and god will use that spouse to do what sharpen you off and take off those rough edges amen because as a man you're going to have to humble yourself and sacrifice and as a woman you're going to have to humble yourself and sacrifice amen you both have to give 100 to marriage right it's not 50 50. it's 100 100 and that's how you get the whole out of it amen but it's not a requirement men and women don't have to be married to be what effective in the kingdom of heaven now right again we'll see it i'm giving you a very broad picture i'm giving you a lot of generalities sisters and brothers alike so you'll see where we're going to go here because what happens so often is that when a brother says i'm going to preach to the man it's all great but when he says i'm going to preach to the sisters now we start to get tightened up and is he going to pin us down for the way we dress and married or not married and working and not working and educating and not educating and saying this and doing that and they get tightened up i'm not here to to hammer you down i'm not here to push you down i'm here to show you where your freedom is and where your limit is amen and then you can self-judge yourself as to whether you want to do that or whether you don't want to do it but we're going to paint a picture for what the word says you can do for what the word says it will bring you to and the beauty and the holiness it'll bring you to and then you get to make a decision do i want it or do i not want it or maybe the bigger question is do i have it or do i not have it amen when i was preaching to the men it was what we're looking at ourselves we're self-examining right that's what we're supposed to do before we go to communion remember scripture says examine yourselves why judge yourselves so that you're not judged right so that the word judges you and you can be dealing with that rather than having other people coming up to you and trying to tell you what to do amen let the word judge you amen i'm not here to judge anybody amen but the thing with being single is that most people can't handle it and again we'll get into this a bit later and paul says i wish everyone was like i was right he was single at that point but he says most people can't handle it jesus said it they came to him when they were talking about divorce laws and and he says you can't do that you can only do it for one reason they said well then it's better for better for us not to be married he says yes but he says most people can't handle it he says some are eunuch and and they're made that way but most aren't and they need to be married to what get past the lust and the desires of the flesh right if you look at a man it's going to be a physical it's going to be physical desires that are probably going to tip him over the edge but he can go into a life of hedonism where he he wants to have toys and he wants to have big vacations and he's always wants to be out having fun in these different things and then for a sister it's going to be a struggle for headship every single time amen because you're going to think because i'm not under headship then i get to do this and this and this and it'll take you completely off the word as well right the man is supposed to be sacrificing and so when he's single the the the the inclination is not to sacrifice it's to live for yourself and for the sing the sisters they're supposed to be under authority and when you're single the the the the pressure is to what not be under authority right that's the two struggles you're going to face is the man's going to be selfish and the woman's going to be headstrong amen but our title today is what the bride's character test we spend a lot of time last service speaking on what character now i want to read the quote for this because we all know it but i want to set a foundation here and a stage for our sisters now this is talking about the bride of christ and brothers we're talking about women but the type is the bride so anything we say about women it applies to us as as we are the part of the bride of christ amen so let's not just look at our sisters let's look at our own lives and say how does this apply to me in my walk with god amen and am i submitting myself and am i doing the same thing that i expect the sisters to do or my wife to do or or whoever it might be amen now brother brown says this he says and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us he says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift so you can't go to god and say god i want character he won't give it it's not something that he deposits into your life it's not something he deposits into your person into your being but if you want character what does he do is he puts you in a battle and he proves what's in you and then you can see do i have what i thought i had or do i not have what i have and then you say lord put in me what i need and he's going to put it there and then he's going to run you through a trial again and a battle again until you have what you say that you needed amen he says a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with characters fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us in us not to us in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing willing not forced not driven not hammered into it but those that are willing to enter his kingdom through what much tribulation amen our tribulation is now brothers and sisters this is where we are judged this is where we are purified this is where we have what the the proof that we are who we say we are they're going to go through a tribulation after we leave our tribulation is now and it is to do one thing and that is produce that character that godly character in our lives he said thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that everyone goes through it and the church that is not suffering and that is not being tried hasn't got it wow the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it now when he says the church he's talking about the called out one so let's take it down to your life if you are not suffering then you don't have it if you didn't suffer to get what you think you have then you don't have what you think you have if i could put it that way amen you have to have suffered to have what you think you have he says what it isn't of god hebrews 12 6 and 8 says for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if ye be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then are ye bastards and not sons and then so we've got a character struggle here and then there's got to be a victory and so men face a character struggle and women face a character struggle now what is the character struggle for us men it is to show our character through love right that is the christ-like nature we're supposed to do is rule by love not by a an iron fist not by a whip not by a club right not by harsh words but to rule by love and that is the ultimate reflection of christ is love god is love amen for god so loved the world that he gave his life right in ephesians 2 25 25 it says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it amen men do a lot of things by nature but loving is rarely one of them physically we're great at it every other way no right why because we are by nature selfish and so the struggle for us is to love in an unselfish way amen and so what we're generally practical and our inclination is to do things that we can touch and see and and we can we can we can have in front of us and whatnot but love goes way beyond what we can put in front the home we can put over our wives head the car we can put in the driveway the clothes on our back and these different things but this is an all-fulfilling love that we're supposed to be doing we can't do it all we never can that's why they need god remember we're supposed to be doing our best to fulfill every need that we can possibly fulfill of theirs amen but the great test for us is to love as christ did amen and so what the great test for us is when we do is when we realize that the women that are under our authority are occasionally stubborn temperamental disobedient illogical overly emotional or any other characteristic that your wife might be able to exhibit that's when the test of your character is it's not when she's making your supper and your breakfast and your lunch exactly the way you want it the house is sparkling clean she looks beautiful every day her breath never smells right and her attitude is phenomenal that is not the test of our character brothers our test of character to love is when she is unlovable because guess what there's going to be a day where she is unlovable to you and you're still going to have to love her where what it's not that you don't love her so you don't feel like loving her right and then can any married men be honest and say there was a day where i didn't feel like loving my wife and the question is what did we do did we act out of that or did we just step right over it and say no i have a christ-like nature i'm going to love you regardless right that's the test for us is to love the unlovable not that they're unlovable all the time but sometimes they're unlovable amen but for the women however they have a different test of character don't they it's in the same scripture it says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands even as unto the lord now that as unto the lord means as if he was god submit yourselves to your husbands as if he was god and in the same way that you submit yourself to god now that is a massive test of your character because what whether you realize it or not yet there is going to be a time where what you'll realize that the men that you are under authority to are imperfect selfish lazy or have any other number of character flaws that this men are able to exhibit right so your test is submit is to submit when the info the authority is imperfect right when the man is clearly doing something wrong as far as you can tell and yet you will still submit to it that is a test of your character is when you'll submit when you really don't want to submit you may have the the best reason you may even have a word reason right but you don't get to force him any more than he gets to force you and so that is the test of your character now remember we said last service this word wives is not wives it is women and it is a woman of any age whether a virgin married or a widow so this is not only to the women to the wives this is for women every believing woman she is to submit to her husband now this doesn't mean that uh obviously if you're single you don't have a a literal husband here but you do have headships so it's either your father but in one thing is certain we are all subject to the word amen so you have to submit yourself to the word regardless and it is to do it as unto the lord as if you were doing it to the lord that word submit it means to submit to one's control to yield to one's ammunition now control is one thing but admonition what do we do when your husband or your father is saying you really shouldn't do this or i wish you would do this that's an admonition amen that's trying to get you to do something without forcing you to do it or to yield to one's admission or advice or to obey but catch the second one this is says a voluntary attitude of giving in voluntary now that's what we have to do with the word amen all of us men and women alike is what we have to voluntarily give ourselves give up our rights and then we are no longer we are no longer free right i am not free we are prisoners as paul said i'm a prisoner to christ amen i'm a love prisoner to christ but that is by volunteering it i gave it up of my own free will and so for the sisters it is a voluntary attitude of giving in of cooperating of assuming responsibility and carrying a burden i will tell you this i'm not a woman but i know what my own leadership is like and for my wife it's a burden to be under my leadership at times it is also a burden to carry the responsibilities that i've given her under that authority amen this is not an easy walk this is something that's going to bring out character in you amen he said that character is a victory so victory implies what a battle hardship struggle and an enemy right this is not a walk in the park we are not full of character having easy lives amen this is going to be a struggle this is going to be a trial for the men and for the women alike amen because why we're all inherently flawed scripture says we have all sinned and come short of the glory of god so we've got flawed men in leadership and we've got flawed women in submission and that means that they're sometimes not going to be in submission and that means that the men are sometimes not going to be in very good authority and yet through it all character is developed amen amen so what we all are flawed we all have to have the new birth we all have to have the indwelling of the holy spirit and this is always a work of grace we've covered it time and time again our pastor his three favorite words are grace grace grace aren't they right why because we need to have it and our our every action or every attitude ought to be tempered with one thing and that is grace for the other person amen for their failures for their shortcomings and for their flaws amen scripture says freely you have received freely give amen now so the sisters the test of their characters to be under authority and to be in submission now contrast that against what the world is saying today what is the world's message today to our sisters to our women free yourselves right do whatever the men are doing you're better than men you can do what men do you can do what men do better you don't need a man you don't need to be married you don't need to have kids you definitely don't need to be under authority to everyone they're saying to the women you're equal with men guess what the word never said otherwise right it's a false argument the word never said that the women were any less right never said that they were less than a man it just said they're under authority to the men but they make up this false argument to the sisters to say well you're less than a man no i'm just in a different role amen amen i'm just in a different role and if i can step into that role then that's where god's gonna bless me amen what are they saying we'll watch your kids for ten dollars a day sisters so you can do what go make more money so you can have what a great life and a ruined marriage they don't tell you the real marriage part do they but they'll tell you that we can take care of your kids for ten dollars a day what kind of what kind of support do you think your kids are getting for ten dollars a day even with government subsidies 25 30 bucks a day you think they're going to do what you can do sisters there's no way there's no way on god's green earth that they're going to be able to take care of your kids for thirty dollars away the way you can if you commit your life to them amen look at hollywood i had to look these up don't judge me hollywood has had a burst of female superheroes in the last five to ten years right and what are they doing is they're starting to take out the men and they're starting to insert the women so we have superwoman we have wonder woman we have black widow we have captain marvel we have bat woman we have the wasp we have catwoman and we have elektra amen and at the same time do you know what they're doing to the male superheroes they're making them lesser and lesser they're emasculating them they're making them into the bad guys the latest captain america is bisexual okay that was supposed to be the symbol of american awesomeness and they've turned him into a separate simpering environmentalist right that's where he is now that's where they put the men and what are they doing they're putting the women in the position of men and they're putting the men in the position of women and what they're really trying to do is make one big lump where there's neither men or women it's just humanity and it's a hundred percent against the word of god every single bit of it amen what is it sisters they're aiming at you okay who did satan pick go back to the very beginning who did he pick we don't know whether he tried adam the scripture's silent on it maybe he went at him and said has god not said and adam said god has said now get out of here. all we know is he's how he saw no opening with adam but there was something about that conversation that first conversation with the woman where she did not reject him outright and from there he stuck with it and he stuck with it and what he's been sticking with it ever since if he can get the woman to fall then he can get the entire society to fall with her okay sisters he's not aiming for the men only he has gun him for the sisters because he's had his greatest success with the sister in the first place amen amen listen if we can see it in hollywood that's satan's throne right satan's throne is hollywood if you can see it happening there then you know that he's trying to do it in our sisters everywhere else amen that his guns are aimed at you amen listen to what brother branham said he says that's what he did in the beginning and he certainly has made a target out of you sisters he does that just to because he knows what he can do he can deceive a woman a thousand times quicker than a man i know that hurts your feelings but that's the truth this isn't brother john amen i'm not here to hammer you i'm reading what the prophet said okay that's exactly that's what he done the garden of eden okay this is the prophet pointing us back to the original sin he says now she was honest and she was sincere and we'd say great and then he says but she was deceived honest and sincere right great attributes great characteristics we should all be honest and sincere but remember brother brown says you can be sincerely wrong right sincerity does not guarantee rightness he says adam was not deceived the bible said he wasn't deceived but she was deceived so he can deceive her amen like i said this is not brother john saying it this is what the prophet said and this is what he's bringing to our sisters amen so the question is this in your sincerity and in your honesty just because you are sincere and honest does not make you right so if you're sitting here and you're insisting on your rightness how did you get to your rightness was it by sitting there and mulling it over and dwelling on it and dwelling on it until you convinced yourself or did you pull it through the word from genesis to revelation because that's where our rightness has to come is through the word not by sitting and mulling it over amen if there's one thing that sisters are very good at it's mulling things over in their head amen they can take things and they can turn it into a very jumble ball very quickly because why that's their nature that's the way they're built as they can take hey listen folks they're magnifiers they're glorifiers and guess what if you have the wrong thing they'll still magnify it right brothers if you don't like what you're getting change what you're giving right because you've got a bad attitude you're a poor provider you're a poor spiritual authority in the home father husband whatever it is if you're poor in that she's going to magnify the poorness but if you're great in it then she's going to magnify the greatness amen so if there's something coming in that's poor she'll magnify it into something that's really bad right but if she can take it back to the word if she can take it back to her husband if she can take it back to her father now maybe he'll maybe steer clear and help her to find her way through it right listen us men have to do the same thing it's not specific to women only just because say you know he says he can fool a woman a thousand times quicker doesn't mean he can't fool a man amen i've been fooled many times amen this is this is not like he can't fool a man therefore go to a man by any means by any means let's not put the man in that position they can't be fooled but what he has an easier time with the sisters that's what he's saying here he said but the woman being deceived was in the transgression see now listen to this eve actually thought she was right you say how he literally said the opposite of the word but eve thought she was right when she accepted it that's how far he got her was he got her 100 percent opposite he turned a yes he turned a no into a yes and she thought that's right okay that took time that didn't happen in a day okay that took time that took influence that cut that that took fellowship with the wrong person right and he got her to believe the opposite of what the word said the literal opposite that's how strong it is eve actually thought she was right but satan deceived her but he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife he represented himself with sin and was condemned by the same and cast out of the garden of eden i can speak by experience and say this many times in dealing with sisters they're trying to do the wrong thing for the right reason they have all the right motives they have all the right objectives but they're trying to do the wrong thing but they have the right reasons for it and that's what makes them think that they're right but the reason doesn't matter if what you're doing is wrong amen i had something i was dealing with recently with my wife and she was just saying you know no you really need to do this and i said no you're i agree with where you're coming from but it says it's still the wrong thing to do you can't do it that way you can't and and you have to hold firm and that's very difficult for us men sometimes because you can see where they're coming from you can see where their heart is you can see where their desire is you can see where their motive is and it's from a great place but that doesn't make it right a right motive does not make us right amen it's got to be right with the word right and then you've got to have the right motive on the flip side us brothers okay let's flip it around we can do the right thing with the wrong motive and we're still just wrong right just because it was right by the word but we did it the wrong way that still makes it wrong did you know that it has to be wrought by the word with the right motive and the right objective that's a challenge for us all isn't it to be right in across the spectrum amen amen now i'm speaking to message believers right now because this is a real challenge to our sisters when i put these quotes up i cringe reading them i cringe putting them in my notes and i cringe speaking them over the pulpit because it doesn't feel good it doesn't sound good it doesn't look good it's a challenge to a sister to read this and say that's me right that's the way i'm built is that i can be deceived more easily than a man but if you can recognize it you can keep it in check right and you cannot get caught up on that high horse of what self-righteousness that comes along so easily and you can humble yourself and say lord give me somebody to help me either confirm it to me not another sister not another sister no go to your head right you've got a father you've got a husband or you got a pastor right you got somebody you can go to to run it by them and say am i right brother am i right husband am i right dad that's what we need to do run it by your headship scripture says if any woman has a question from what happens in the service go ask her husband right if you're single go ask your father right and say dad did i read that right did i hear that right is that right is that really what we believe is that really what he said no take it back to your headship right amen but your test sisters your character test is submission and your natural inclination is that you're more easily deceived can you see how that's going to cause friction right you have to submit and yet you have a very high opinion of what you think you think you're right but you're often not that's your natural inclination that's what the prophet's saying here is you've got a natural inclination that allows you to be more easily deceived than a man but you think you're right still that's a hard thing to to deal with amen especially under flawed leadership especially under flawed leadership because it magnifies that and you're like well he's definitely not right and he may not be right that's the difficulty here right so victory for a woman in terms of characters is what submitting even when she's convinced she's right you've got to the word says you submit right it doesn't listen submission is not based on the qualifications of the man it just says submit right now you have to do it as unto the lord you don't do something that is clearly off the word right if your husband's trying to force you to go out dancing and drinking or something you don't have to do that that's clearly off the word right but in everything else if it's not off to work then you do it right and it's not whether he's perfect or great or amazing or even right you're still under authority because what he answers to god he answers to god you're answering to god through him in that sense but it's will you submit and then you get let god sort that out and guess what us brothers it's no fun when god deals with you does it when you're off when you're off base when you're stepping into a path of your own making when you're on your high horse god knocks us down so quickly sisters he knocks us down so quickly right and it'll allow you to say i need to pray for him rather than i need a rant about him right i need to dig in my heels right because that's the inclination is what dig in our heels i don't want to do it i don't blame you for not wanting to do it many times i don't blame you for not wanting to do it it's difficult us men are difficult right but you're called to do it anyways he says this also there's nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman now the fall proves this statement to be true the fall in the beginning she was not in the original beginning creation she was in adam but not in a female sex herself at the beginning she was the byproduct made he says now there is nothing designed that can deceive and be deceived as easy as a woman and we see that today because what it is i i believe we could say it's a woman's world now in the sense that the influence is coming from the females far more than the men you still have men at the highest levels of of economy and companies and that it's still very much a a male dominated aside from the commerce side of things but from where things are shifting now it is heavily female driven and then whether it's in hollywood whether it's in education we have more women are educated than men now right we have what a lot more women going into the workforce instead of going into marriage and you have this real shift in hollywood you have it in the politics you have it in in commerce and these different things in education you see the influence of women coming in and guess what that's satan's pride right he's developing a bride and god's developing a bride and so when you look at the world you see what satan's bride looks like so sisters if you're matching up to what the world is teaching guess whose bride you're patterning yourself after right satan's bride because he's preparing his church and what christ is preparing his church amen and she's not going to line up with the world in any way or fashion and then it's just not going to happen now here's the thing you say that's about women that's it okay great listen god has put things on our shoulders that he expects us to do and guess what compared to god there's nothing that can deceive or be as easily deceived as a human right we talk about the woman being a weaker vessel guess what guess what i am right here right now i'm the weaker vessel right where's god god's up there the unseen spirit and he's using what me to speak to you he's using the weaker vessel isn't he right so when we look at this listen i can be deceived as easily as anybody else i'm not saying that we can't right i'm saying that god has chosen to use an easily deceived vessel men are easily deceived as inhumanity is easily deceived and yet he uses humanity we are his hands and feet we are his voice on this earth amen so again it's not that we can't identify it as men with what the sisters are going through because god chooses to use us and then we fail and we fail and we we don't submit and we do things our own way and we try and take control that's the way we get denominations as men trying to take control isn't it right so man we can identify with this can't we we've been deceived we've gone our own way we've done our own things we've tried to do things in a way that is contrary to the word and every time we come back and god slaps our hand and brings us back and we line up again we try again right us man we know a lot about submission if we're real believers amen and we know what it's like to get off and we know what it's like to be brought back on so it's not that it's only on you sisters amen like i said men are called to love the unlovable and women are called to submit to the imperfect who's got the tougher road who's got the tougher road i'd say my wife has the tougher road i find it easier to love her than i think she finds it to to follow me because i know my own flaws and then i i know my own failures i know the thoughts i have right i know the inclinations i have and sometimes even when i do the right thing i know that inside i don't feel the same way that i'm doing i'm doing it because i'm forced to do it in the sense that i will i refuse to allow myself to do something contrary to the word but yet often there is a little thing in there that says this is really not what i'd rather be doing right now right right for me i i i can commiserate with the sisters i can say knowing my own flaws i can say it must be tough it must be tough because here's the thing i have to know how to submit to christ but my husband is perfect nein or nina nina right my husband's perfect your husbands aren't perfect right to me i think that's harder i think our sisters have a harder road that's just me amen that's that's that's that's brother john it's only an opinion amen but you aren't called to submit because men are better or greater you're just called because that's the way god said to do it it's really that some simple it's it's really that simple but i meant one day women are going to be restored to your original position amen and guess what the women will the men will be shouting hallelujah that day just as much as the women are believe me because it takes a big load off of our shoulders as well and men don't think there's not pressure on the men to do these things amen it's a difficult life to bear that responsibility that to have that christ-like nature to try and and bring people bring a wife bring a family to an eternal destination amen it's not an easy thing to do but one day we won't have to do it and we'll praise the lord together and we'll be under one great head that time again and then we'll be restored back to that eden condition we'll be under one man and that's christ our heavenly bridegroom right but there's only one thing that will put a woman back in her place and it's the word of god quickened by the holy spirit it's the only thing that's going to get you there lebron says this now i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upwards i want to stop there and say god forces upwards when when trials and struggles hit what do we do do we do this or do we do this right do we try and do it with national no force do we do with physical force or do we do it with godly force where we say lord this is your way of doing it i'm giving it back into your hands amen because when we start doing this then we block out this right god will never intervene as long as you're trying to do it on your own but what if you can give it back to the one who set it up in the first place now he's responsible for sorting it out he says the spirit of god which is the word of god my spirit word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word and then she's in christ will put her in her place if you can stay in your place he's got something to work with but if you get out of your place then he's got nothing to work with he can't respond except to his word and if you step out of the word then what's he going to respond to nothing right he's got to get you back he says no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the national forces of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory out of it o people recognize your day as jesus warned you the sign of sodom and the church's conditions of this day and then your sisters want to find your position get the holy ghost you'll never find it without it you'll never find it without it you'll struggle and you'll strive and and you'll make your own life miserable you'll make your family's life miserable your husbands your fathers whatever the case may be if you don't have the holy ghost there's no way you're going to step into this because you've got to find rest in a place of imperfect authority amen and that's only going to come through the indwelling of the holy spirit in your life amen and what the holy spirit does not give you freedom to run around the holy spirit gives you freedom to submit yourself to the word of god just like the man next to you amen it calls us in remember we said the universal attribute of the believers of the church the bride of christ is that they will submit themselves to the word they will align themselves with the word remember we read that quote where brother brown says in every revival it causes the women the church the called out ones to what come back to the word to align with the word him and that's the same thing and the holy ghost has to give you a desire to submit the same way it has to give a man a desire to rule with love right because lots of men want to rule not many want to rule with love right he's got to give us a desire a change a nature change to cause us to want what he wants amen now is that easy no it's a battle every day isn't it it's a battle for us men it's a battle for the women and there's nothing about victory that's easy like we said before victory implies struggle it implies a battle it implies hardship that implies an enemy and then so you're going to be fighting every day to do this sort of thing amen he says in women i want you to look in the mirror and look what god requires a woman to do and see in god's mirror not in your church mirror now in god's mirror and see if you could qualify in your life as a spiritual bride of jesus christ now that goes for every one of us that's not just to the sisters is look at our lives and say does that qualify as the bride of christ but remember as we preach that service you the women the sisters are the type of the bride right they're the reflection when when we look at them on the street they're a reflection of the condition of the church i think it's amazing i'm sure the men can identify this you're driving around and mostly you're guarding your eyes but you see a woman walking with a skirt and long hair what do you say whoa immediately without ever talking to that you say that's potentially a christian doesn't mean she is a christian but potentially that's a christian and it quickens and we're like hey that could be one of us and then we look and we see do they go to our church maybe it's a pentecostal maybe it's just a worldly woman that has realized that that long hair and those dresses are absolutely gorgeous right you never know but as soon as we see it we know it don't we you sisters you don't ever have to speak a word you don't ever have to speak a word just by walking around dress the way you do with the attitudes you have the hair the way it is it is an instant recognition that there's something different about you and it's amazing like i said like we'll be walking through i never go to the mall but you walk through the mall or you walk through something or you're driving down the street and as soon as you see it you say who's that who's that is that someone we know because why there's a need there's just something that quickens inside you and says there's something about them right they're different what do you measure up ministers he says think the same do you cut corners here to save somebody's feelings over yonder it's a tough one as well doesn't it guess what we're all flawed i see some of the flaws brother gerald sees some of the flaws we all see flaws if i get up here and i preach against the flaw that you have do you know how that makes me feel if i know about it it makes me feel horrible i'm not preaching at you i'm preaching the word but that's not an easy thing to do you sit in that office you go home you beat yourself up did they take it the right way i didn't realize that i didn't i forgot that they even had that and then you know who brings it to your mind later it's not god brings it to your mind later satan to try and get you to what to back off the next time you're going to say something right what to make you gun shy right listen a minister has to sit up here and he has to move as the spirit of god moves him and then it's up to the people to take it or leave it but if he is silent when god tells him to speak he answers for it and it's not a pretty picture amen it's a hard thing to do he says would you do this if they'll put you out of the church if you're feeling that way my dear brother let me warn you in the name of jesus christ flee from that right now and lady if you can't measure up to the qualification of a christian not as a nominal christian what's a nominal christian outward signs right you know what's inside of you i know what's inside of me you know what's helped keep me humble with the small humility that i have is i know what's inside of me and when you're honest and when you're praying before god right when you go and you're dealing with a situation or something like that guess what if you go in with an honest heart and say what am i contributing to this usually you don't end up praying too much for that person you usually end up praying for yourself because you see where you're contributing and where you've had an impact and it's not the spirit of christ in your life amen i know what's inside of me i know the flesh that is jonathan corlett and it's not a pretty thing it's not a good thing and when i see that flesh creeping out then i go to pray for me before i'll ever pray for that person because i want the change here i want the change here i'm i want to make it to heaven no matter what and then once i'm convinced that god has dealt with me and i've repented and i've made it right now i can pray for them i believe that's why brother brahm says when you see a somebody's done you wrong or this that and the other he says go in and pray i think the first thing he says god will show you what they're dealing with but i believe he'll show you what's working in your life and what you need to clue up as well amen i want to look at my own life he says lady if you can't measure up to the qualification of a christian not as a nominal christian but in your heart and your life is patterned exactly like god's marriage certificate here says it has to be and church member if your church isn't like that that can measure up to god's qualification of his word get out of it and get into christ i want to finish with this scripture because it speaks of the glory that comes after humbling and submission amen and it's philippians 2 it says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man listen to this now he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth amen that's what you sisters are reflecting that is the highest level of submission is what he did what he submitted himself he humbled himself to the will of god to the point that it took his life but guess what he was a dying sacrifice you're not called to be a dying sacrifice you're called to be a living sacrifice and that that stretches it out doesn't it now it's not just a one-day victory it's not a three-day victory like jesus said but this is an everyday victory this is an everyday sacrifice that you've got to be living amen in submission to the word of god that's where you've got to be amen you get the same reward as the men if you look in the scriptures and you look in revelations 2 and 3 when it goes through it says to him that overcomes now that hymn is not a man that him is what it's to everybody there's no differentiation between women and men when it comes to overcomers we all sit with him in the throne amen every single one of us is going to be a victorious overcomer right so in the end you've got to you've got to you've got to win your victory and we've got to win our victory as men amen no one's getting out of here without a battle that's for sure and then every one of us has got to struggle and we're just going to face different challenges to get there even as women you're going to face different challenges than the other sisters as men we face different challenges based on what god's given us the way god's made us right we've got to have internal victories we've got to have external victories we've got to have character flaws that are filled in and smoothed out and these different things everybody's going to face a different battle amen amen god bless you let's stand together and then i cover your prayers in this series and then it was real easy to preach to the brothers because i'm a brother i have experience being a brother right i have no experience being a woman and then the only type i have is as a member of the bride of christ and like i said i'm under perfect headship so i don't have the struggles the sisters do so i'm trying to preach it as tight as i can with as much grace as i can amen we've got to have an honest understanding of where we at where we're at right now and then we got to see where we're at and it is in a fallen condition men and women alike and that's why we're talking about these things is because we're being brought into what a mature perfect condition but the men have a different walk than the women do it's all through the word but we have those different struggles and that's going to be difficult for us amen so i pray you'll just give me grace as i go through this amen because i want the sisters to see the tremendous respect the tremendous importance the beauty the holiness that you reflect in the body of christ and then it's it's amazing as we get into it the things that the word opens up for our sisters and i want you to be inspired by this not cut down not trim not put in a box there are there are boundaries the word has boundaries for every one of us amen if you're outside the boundaries let's cut off the things that are outside the boundaries but let's see the beauty of what's inside that box amen amen i'm not here to limit you i'm here to expand to let you see what god sees to try and paint the picture that he has for you amen let's just power our heads together heavenly father lord how we need your grace lord men and women alike brothers and sisters married single old and young lord the battle never stops lord in fact i think the battle just rages longer and harder every single day lord but you've given us grace lord you promised us a a a certain end lord and that is that we would be overcomers and lord so we ask as we continue to take this series lord that we would look into our own lives lord as brother steve said let's not have a pitchfork sermon where we're looking at other people but lord may we examine ourselves lord so that we're not judged lord but we let the word judge us and clean us and correct us heavenly father lord give grace to the hearer especially lord god i pray may they see to the heart of your word lord if i say something wrong lord if i say something that offends or forgive me lord but grant grace to the hearer especially we pray lord god lord just have your way in these services lord minister to your bride we pray men and women alike lord may we humble ourselves all lord before your throne of grace or be with us now we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen i found it all 1182.
