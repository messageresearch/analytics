[46:36] way of saying amen
[46:38] amen so be it so the lord bless you and
[46:42] uh we pray the grace of god to be with
[46:44] us in the remainder of this service
[46:46] as we go into the message that i've been
[46:48] referring to
[46:49] i've been talking about spiritual your
[46:51] spiritual or religious
[46:53] and my intention was to bring some
[46:55] thoughts from the message spiritual
[46:57] amnesia
[46:58] so we're going to let you hear the
[47:00] message and
[47:01] of course not all of it but
[47:05] we'll just start after the prophet reads
[47:08] the scripture
[47:09] and i'm going to read that scripture
[47:10] right here and we'll finish just before
[47:12] he goes into a prayer line
[47:14] and again it's uh
[47:18] it's a birmingham series of messages
[47:22] that he preached in 1964
[47:25] amen so i pray the grace of god to that
[47:27] you're going to pay attention to what
[47:28] he's saying
[47:29] and you're going to let god judge you by
[47:31] what is being said
[47:33] and that's the truth you're standing
[47:34] you're in the altar now you're in the
[47:36] hour of judgment
[47:37] amen god not judging just judging the
[47:39] world there
[47:40] god's judging us amen by the word
[47:43] probably god said that when the ministry
[47:44] of the words
[47:45] so now he says but remember this judging
[47:48] that
[47:48] this person that person and so on and
[47:52] we've got to recognize it receive it and
[47:54] repent of it
[47:55] and move on by the grace of god it's not
[47:57] that we're lost
[47:58] but it's just that god wants to correct
[48:00] us so that we are going to truly
[48:02] represent him as sons and daughters of
[48:04] god not sons and daughters of william
[48:07] branham
[48:08] no no sons and daughters of god amen
[48:11] so by the grace of god the new birth
[48:13] your new birth really proves it
[48:16] what you really are are you even born
[48:18] again of the
[48:19] of the letter of the word or you feel
[48:20] you've been born again by the
[48:22] by the power of the anointing and spirit
[48:24] of the word amen
[48:26] so let's make our calling and election
[48:28] sure again
[48:29] again to remind you that the power of
[48:31] god in preaching the minister
[48:33] the message of three kinds of believers
[48:35] he had a reason for doing that
[48:37] because he wanted the people to judge
[48:39] themselves is that me
[48:41] well judge yourself by the word is going
[48:43] forth over the pulpit
[48:45] lord is that me am i lacking that am i
[48:47] going too far with that
[48:49] and so on so i pray the grace of god
[48:51] that
[48:52] in in the hearing of the of the message
[48:54] three kinds of believers you determine
[48:56] which one was you amen that's what he
[48:59] wanted to do
[49:00] now he said there's believers are you a
[49:01] believer but he said there's
[49:03] unbelievers and there's make believers
[49:05] so what are you
[49:07] i'm sure that he was ministering to to
[49:09] those that
[49:10] that were make believers he was
[49:12] ministering to others that were
[49:13] unbelievers
[49:14] amen it's like i said that when the
[49:17] power of god preached the message
[49:18] church order amazing when he preached it
[49:22] and a lot of the people left bradham
[49:25] tabernacle
[49:27] because they didn't agree with what he
[49:28] was saying in church order
[49:30] but he again he had a reason for
[49:32] preaching it he had a reason for saying
[49:34] what he said
[49:34] and really he was judging he was judging
[49:37] those that were professing to have the
[49:38] gift
[49:39] of prophecy the gift to do this to gift
[49:41] to do that and so on
[49:42] he knew that it was a wrong anointing
[49:45] amen
[49:46] so that's why he preached the way he
[49:48] preached that's why he laid it out the
[49:49] way he laid it out
[49:50] concerning church order amen and we know
[49:53] that he totally
[49:54] done away with what we used to have in
[49:57] denominational
[49:58] or protestant churches for years
[50:01] and that was a testimony meeting oh yeah
[50:04] i remember that in growing up in the
[50:06] salvation army in pentecost
[50:09] and for the most part it was in those
[50:12] those churches and similar churches that
[50:15] they would go in
[50:16] and they would start singing they have a
[50:17] song service and then they
[50:19] they get a brother or sister to come up
[50:22] and lead
[50:24] hymns and choruses for a testimony
[50:27] meeting
[50:29] and of course it wasn't the best
[50:32] because i i remember even in pentecost
[50:34] one time that
[50:35] that the the rabbit testimony me and
[50:37] this brother testified testified and
[50:40] then
[50:40] somebody else started a chorus to sing
[50:42] them down because they were going too
[50:44] far with their testimony
[50:45] amen and i've of course experienced that
[50:48] even in pentecost
[50:50] and so on so we got to the place where
[50:52] the testimony meeting was out
[50:54] of order amen and that's the way it was
[50:56] in tabernacle
[50:58] but he wasn't going to put up with it no
[51:00] no that's why he did away with testimony
[51:02] meetings
[51:03] amen and i remember
[51:06] having experience testimony means in
[51:07] believers churches that i did approach
[51:10] the pastor
[51:10] i said brother one thing you need to do
[51:13] i said stop testimonies
[51:14] i say get rid of it why because i've
[51:17] experienced it there in certain
[51:18] believers churches
[51:20] and this believer get up while he's
[51:21] supposed to testify but all he did was
[51:23] preach
[51:24] oh yeah it wasn't just a brief testimony
[51:27] for the glory of god
[51:29] and what god did no no he started to
[51:31] preach
[51:32] i said brother stop your testimony
[51:34] meetings i said
[51:35] get rid of it i said because because why
[51:38] because i really saw the pastor there
[51:40] sitting on the pulpit sitting on the on
[51:42] the platform
[51:44] and with his bible and notes in his hand
[51:46] and he would wait for two or three hours
[51:49] oh yeah wait for two or three hours
[51:50] before you get to the pulpit
[51:52] and i said brother it's about time you
[51:54] stop those things as you've got to give
[51:56] more time to the word of god
[51:58] amen praise the lord so i pray the grace
[52:00] of god
[52:01] amen that we saw we know who we are
[52:05] as a result of the message of three
[52:07] kinds of believers
[52:08] do you really really honestly and
[52:11] sincerely know who
[52:12] you are amen did you find out that oh oh
[52:16] thank you lord i'm a believer amen
[52:19] praise the lord welcome my brother
[52:20] kingsley
[52:22] and uh he said oh but he knew
[52:25] there were a few believers there but he
[52:27] knew for the most part they were
[52:28] make believers and unbelievers amen
[52:32] as i said quite a few after he preached
[52:35] that message church ordered quite a few
[52:36] of them quite a number of them
[52:37] just moved out of that church and into
[52:40] another brothers church
[52:41] amen as far as i know that other
[52:44] brothers church is still there
[52:46] and we'll be in prayer for the for the
[52:48] voice of god
[52:49] and those in branham tabernacle because
[52:51] right now they are going through some
[52:53] a lot of construction work and i believe
[52:56] that the services are cancelled
[52:59] in brown tabernacle and also in the new
[53:01] building that they built
[53:03] or that they bought rather and it was an
[53:05] arena
[53:06] of some kind where they used to play
[53:08] certain games there but
[53:10] the voice of god bought the building and
[53:12] they used it for
[53:13] sunday night services or some no sunday
[53:17] services and because why
[53:20] because those that came on sunday uh
[53:23] were such
[53:24] numbers that they could they couldn't
[53:26] set them all in branham tabernacle
[53:28] brown tabernacle would seat around 500
[53:30] people
[53:31] but the new building would allow them to
[53:33] have over a thousand people
[53:36] that would come for a sunday service so
[53:38] we pray the grace of god to be with them
[53:40] and give them his leadership in their
[53:43] construction
[53:45] so brother god help us we're living in
[53:47] that hour now
[53:48] the last day brother we need to know who
[53:50] we are
[53:52] yeah and if whoever you are that's the
[53:55] faith you're going to have
[53:57] so are you a make-believer an unbeliever
[54:00] or or an absolute believer amen
[54:04] i pray the grace of god and ministry to
[54:05] believers amen
[54:07] and we're laying in the word laying in
[54:08] the word so it's to to us to
[54:10] i like believers so it's to bring out
[54:13] the the spirit nature
[54:15] and attitude of true believers amen
[54:19] well god says this and god does that
[54:21] before it's just there to get your
[54:23] reaction
[54:24] to bring out the reaction of his seed
[54:26] amen his sons and daughters
[54:28] amen so pray i pray the grace of god
[54:31] that we're going to
[54:32] react as seed of god we're going to
[54:35] react as
[54:35] as god is looking for sons and daughters
[54:37] to react
[54:38] and what to do and how to do it you know
[54:41] and so on he's looking at
[54:42] looking at your attitude amen again
[54:46] as i preached there a little while ago
[54:48] you're going people go to hell not
[54:49] because of what they did
[54:50] because what they didn't do amen oh yeah
[54:53] there's right there in the scripture
[54:55] where jesus sent those to hell and what
[54:57] is it because he said you didn't do it
[54:59] to the least of these my brethren he
[55:00] said you didn't do it to me
[55:02] amen so you don't think i'm a christian
[55:05] and i'm spiritual
[55:07] because i i believe the message and i do
[55:10] this and i do that
[55:11] well brother it's got to be as christ
[55:13] did amen
[55:14] make sacrifices for one another oh yeah
[55:17] give the preemise to jesus by the grace
[55:20] of god
[55:22] amen so the lord bless us so we're going
[55:24] to
[55:26] i'm going to let you hear and and again
[55:28] i think it might be an hour
[55:29] maybe not it's it's a short message so
[55:32] we're going to
[55:33] start after he read the scripture but
[55:35] we'll finish
[55:36] just before he goes into the prayer line
[55:39] amen and pray for the people
[55:41] so god bless you let's stand and sing

[55:50] god wants us to believe it and i believe
[55:52] in the way that man wants you to believe
[55:53] it
[55:54] but the way that god wants you and well
[55:56] what is the difference well one is
[55:58] intellectual the other

[1:02:44] i believe
[1:02:48] amen praise the lord i want you to turn
[1:02:51] with me to the book of amos
[1:02:52] chapter one amen
[1:02:58] amen it's just a couple of chapters our
[1:03:02] books after this daniel series
[1:03:07] and thank you all for your prayers for
[1:03:08] our brother ellsworth
[1:03:12] he apparently he apparently expressed
[1:03:15] that he really enjoyed the fellowship
[1:03:18] and uh and staying with us he said
[1:03:20] brother
[1:03:21] he said i feel like i'm home and he said
[1:03:24] that's good
[1:03:24] i really appreciate that amen so keep
[1:03:27] him in prayer
[1:03:29] he's had the surgery and he is due back
[1:03:32] again in about i guess three weeks
[1:03:34] to see the doctor that performed the
[1:03:36] surgery so we pray the
[1:03:38] grace of god be with him and to bring
[1:03:40] him to complete recovery
[1:03:43] amen by the grace of god
[1:03:46] so that just just keep one another in
[1:03:48] prayer
[1:03:50] grace grace grace well if i tell you
[1:03:53] this
[1:03:54] if you're born again you've got the
[1:03:55] spirit of christ in you you're
[1:03:57] you're going to have the same attitude
[1:03:58] as jesus said he was right there for you
[1:04:01] right there for me have you really
[1:04:03] considered taking as serious
[1:04:05] what he has done for you
[1:04:09] it's amazing i pray gracious we've got
[1:04:12] the revelation
[1:04:13] and it's going to make us more and more
[1:04:14] humble
[1:04:16] considering what the praise that he paid
[1:04:18] for your redemption of mine
[1:04:20] brother he cried and cried what what a
[1:04:22] burden
[1:04:23] was on his heart and he cried and cried
[1:04:26] and prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:04:27] amen i took finally on on the cross
[1:04:32] he bowed his head he gave up
[1:04:36] not my will but thine be done the will
[1:04:39] of god
[1:04:40] for our redemption that's what it was
[1:04:42] all about
[1:04:43] so thank god that jesus did what he did
[1:04:46] just think he suffered
[1:04:47] for you to redeem you
[1:04:51] how much are we willing to suffer for
[1:04:52] him
[1:04:54] god help us
[1:04:58] in the book of amos
[1:05:01] chapter 1 let's see
[1:05:09] okay i don't know where the prophet was
[1:05:14] okay
[1:05:17] verse six
[1:05:20] thus said the lord for three
[1:05:22] transgressions of gaza
[1:05:24] and for four i will not turn away the
[1:05:27] punishment thereof
[1:05:28] because they carried away captive the
[1:05:31] whole
[1:05:31] captivity to deliver them up to edom
[1:05:36] but i will send fire on the wall of gaza
[1:05:40] which shall devour the places thereof
[1:05:44] amen and i will cut off the inhabitants
[1:05:48] or inhabitant from ashdod
[1:05:51] and him that holdeth the scepter from
[1:05:54] ascalon
[1:05:55] and i will turn mine and against echaron
[1:05:58] and the remnant of the philistines shall
[1:06:00] perish saith the lord god
[1:06:03] and thus saith the lord for three
[1:06:05] transgressions of tyrus
[1:06:07] and for four i will not turn away the
[1:06:10] punishment thereof
[1:06:11] because they delivered up the whole
[1:06:13] captivity
[1:06:15] to edom and remember not
[1:06:18] the brotherly covenant but i will send a
[1:06:21] fire on the wall of tyrus
[1:06:23] which shall devour the palaces thereof
[1:06:26] thus
[1:06:26] saith the lord for three transgressions
[1:06:30] of edom
[1:06:31] and for four i will not turn away the
[1:06:33] punishment thereof
[1:06:34] because he did pursue his brothers
[1:06:37] his brother with the sword and did cast
[1:06:40] off all
[1:06:41] pity and his anger did tear perpetually
[1:06:46] and he kept his wrath forever but i will
[1:06:48] send a fire upon
[1:06:50] demon which should devour the palaces of
[1:06:54] basra thus saith the lord
[1:06:58] for three transgressions of children of
[1:07:00] amen and for four
[1:07:02] i will not turn away the punishment
[1:07:05] thereof amen excuse me
[1:07:14] and concerning what god has spoken
[1:07:16] concerning the hour and
[1:07:18] the in the world we're living in he will
[1:07:20] not
[1:07:22] cancel it and again there's something i
[1:07:25] want to
[1:07:26] also mention some other time because
[1:07:28] there was a somebody
[1:07:30] asked me about it and it was is what the
[1:07:33] scripture says about god
[1:07:34] repenting they said you mean to tell me
[1:07:37] god got to repent
[1:07:40] well i said got to be the way that you
[1:07:42] that
[1:07:43] that he does it spiritual i said let's
[1:07:45] let's see what's going on
[1:07:46] let's see what it means and i said i'll
[1:07:48] share with share it with you later
[1:07:50] amen and there are a number of
[1:07:52] references there in the bible
[1:07:54] where god repented god repented of this
[1:07:58] repentance of that
[1:07:59] and they felt that if he was god why
[1:08:01] would he have to repent
[1:08:02] well that's another thought i guess i'm
[1:08:05] going to have to share with you
[1:08:06] amen and share with you those scriptures
[1:08:08] and explain to you what it is
[1:08:10] amen it's not the repentance that he's
[1:08:12] looking for in you and me
[1:08:14] not by any means amen thank god
[1:08:17] all right let's go to chapter 3 of amos
[1:08:21] and beginning to read at verse 1.
[1:08:27] hear this word that the lord hath spoken
[1:08:29] against you
[1:08:30] o children of israel against the whole
[1:08:34] family
[1:08:35] or all the tribes which i brought from
[1:08:38] the land of egypt
[1:08:39] saying you only have
[1:08:42] i known of all the families of the earth
[1:08:46] amazing
[1:08:47] therefore i will punish you for all your
[1:08:50] iniquities
[1:08:52] can two walk together except they be
[1:08:55] agreed
[1:08:56] amen if we got the same spirit we'll
[1:08:59] agree
[1:09:00] amen humbling ourselves one to another
[1:09:03] in the fear of god
[1:09:05] so he said can two walk together except
[1:09:07] they be agreed
[1:09:09] will a lion roar in the forest when he
[1:09:12] hath no prey
[1:09:13] will a young lion cry out of his den if
[1:09:17] he have taken nothing can a bird fall
[1:09:21] on in a snare upon the earth where no
[1:09:24] jinn is for him shall one take up a
[1:09:27] snare from the earth
[1:09:29] and have taken nothing of all
[1:09:32] shall a trumpet be blown in the city and
[1:09:35] the people
[1:09:36] not be afraid amen
[1:09:40] shall there be an evil in a city and the
[1:09:42] lord hath not
[1:09:43] done it surely the lord god will do
[1:09:47] nothing but he revealeth his secret
[1:09:51] unto his servants the prophets amen
[1:09:55] the lion hath lord who will not fear
[1:09:59] the lord god has spoken who can
[1:10:02] but prophesy god bless his word to our
[1:10:05] hearts
[1:10:06] and this was the word the scriptures
[1:10:08] that the prophet of god
[1:10:10] read as he proceeded to the message on
[1:10:15] spiritual amnesia amen
[1:10:21] so brother i pray the grace of god give
[1:10:22] us the understanding that we need
[1:10:24] and to give us yes what we need
[1:10:26] personally
[1:10:27] amen that we're going to pay close
[1:10:30] attention to the preaching of the word
[1:10:32] the ministry of the word
[1:10:33] amen but let's recognize what's there
[1:10:36] for us
[1:10:37] let's recognize what's there for me was
[1:10:39] there for you amen
[1:10:41] so that's unfortunate that down through
[1:10:43] the years that in the preaching of the
[1:10:44] word the ministry of the word
[1:10:46] that that people have failed to
[1:10:48] recognize oh well the lord is talking to
[1:10:50] me
[1:10:51] the lord is correcting me the lord's
[1:10:53] encouraging me through the preaching of
[1:10:55] his word
[1:10:56] most just think well pretty he's going
[1:10:57] to preach and this is what he's going to
[1:10:58] preach
[1:10:59] and it's over with now so we can have
[1:11:00] sing and sing and go home
[1:11:02] yeah that's because they're they're
[1:11:04] they're religious but there's nothing
[1:11:05] spiritual
[1:11:06] amen so i pray the grace of god be with
[1:11:09] us that we'll have a revelation and
[1:11:11] understanding of the spiritual
[1:11:12] things that god wants to impart to us
[1:11:15] maybe there's something in this message
[1:11:17] amen that you want he wants us to apply
[1:11:20] to our lives
[1:11:22] not just say i believe it in my you know
[1:11:24] i believe it i believe it it's mostly in
[1:11:25] the head
[1:11:26] but brother if you believe it in your
[1:11:28] heart you're going to apply it to your
[1:11:29] life
[1:11:30] amen that's the thing but most people
[1:11:33] think i'm all right i got nothing to
[1:11:34] worry about jesus did it all
[1:11:36] yeah but what are you going to do now
[1:11:39] he's looking
[1:11:40] looking for christ in you you're going
[1:11:42] to make the same sacrifice as christ did
[1:11:44] in
[1:11:45] in the flesh now it's in your flesh by
[1:11:48] the grace of god
[1:11:49] but again people don't consider it so i
[1:11:52] pray that the lord will
[1:11:53] speak to our hearts amen that will
[1:11:56] suffer for him
[1:11:57] as he suffered for us amen but i tell
[1:12:00] you and again the scripture encourages
[1:12:01] that
[1:12:02] that as as believers we're there for
[1:12:05] tribulation
[1:12:06] we're going not to great tribulation but
[1:12:08] it's tribulation everyday living
[1:12:10] why because of our stand for the word
[1:12:12] because of our stand for jesus
[1:12:14] we're going to endure this and endure
[1:12:15] this and endure that amen
[1:12:17] i tell you what we've got to do we've
[1:12:18] got to lay our lives down
[1:12:20] in christ amen by the grace of god
[1:12:24] so they're not living for ourselves
[1:12:25] we're living for jesus that's the truth
[1:12:28] oh brother it makes no difference where
[1:12:30] it is how it is you're living for jesus
[1:12:32] so lord and that's why we always say not
[1:12:35] my will thine be done
[1:12:36] amen so you've got to find you
[1:12:40] believe this is the will of god as i
[1:12:42] said before
[1:12:43] that the lord led me to do this i did it
[1:12:45] and the lord
[1:12:46] opened the door for this and i went in
[1:12:48] and he opened the door for that i went
[1:12:49] in
[1:12:50] and he's trained me in this and trained
[1:12:52] me in that amen by the grace of god
[1:12:55] why because he felt that before it was
[1:12:58] all over i would need this training i
[1:13:00] would need this experience
[1:13:01] in dealing with the things that i'd have
[1:13:02] to deal with for these last 50 years
[1:13:05] amen that is the truth so god is
[1:13:07] training us
[1:13:08] and god is training you amen by his word
[1:13:12] because brother i tell you and closer we
[1:13:14] get to the resurrection rapture
[1:13:16] the greater and greater the separation
[1:13:19] oh yes
[1:13:19] it's going to get greater and greater so
[1:13:21] i pray the grace of god help us
[1:13:24] yeah it says the closer we get to the
[1:13:26] resurrection rapture the separation from
[1:13:28] unbelief
[1:13:29] will become greater yeah
[1:13:33] by the grace of god but what we need to
[1:13:34] do in those circumstances
[1:13:38] when we're experiencing these things we
[1:13:40] got to remember lot's wife
[1:13:43] don't and all that you're you're
[1:13:45] enduring
[1:13:46] and stand you're taking for the word
[1:13:49] don't endure
[1:13:50] don't don't forget lost wife and turn
[1:13:52] around look back at this
[1:13:54] oh i'm gonna look at this i guess i
[1:13:56] gotta see this i gotta say no
[1:13:57] keep on going you put your sight up
[1:14:00] there
[1:14:00] don't turn her back amen so remember
[1:14:04] lot's wife by the grace of god
[1:14:07] amen so we'll go from here into the
[1:14:10] ministry
[1:14:11] of the prophet and again it's 1964
[1:14:14] and it is about a year after the opening
[1:14:16] of the seven seals
[1:14:18] so god bless the word to our hearts amen
[1:14:20] and again
[1:14:22] let's see if we are spiritual or just
[1:14:25] religious
[1:14:26] amen god help us god bless you brother
[1:14:30] put the tape amen
[1:14:38] tomorrow don't forget it tomorrow at two
[1:14:41] o'clock
[1:14:43] and now our next service will begin next
[1:14:44] week in tampa
[1:14:46] florida now i want to speak on spiritual
[1:14:49] i need amnesia now
[1:14:52] this little fellow that we're talking
[1:14:54] about amos just for a moment to get our
[1:14:56] background before we get to the text
[1:14:59] this was during the time of the great
[1:15:01] prosperity
[1:15:02] in samaria israel had prospered they had
[1:15:06] really
[1:15:07] went after the world and it prospered
[1:15:10] not always prosperity is a sign of
[1:15:13] spiritual blessings
[1:15:14] but sometimes on the contrary people
[1:15:17] think maybe you have to
[1:15:19] own a lot of worldly goods and shows
[1:15:22] that god's a blessing
[1:15:23] that's not true sometimes it's the other
[1:15:26] way
[1:15:27] but we find him we don't know much about
[1:15:29] this little
[1:15:30] fella he we have no history where he
[1:15:33] come from we know to you according to
[1:15:34] the scripture here he's a herdsman
[1:15:36] but god had raised him up i can imagine
[1:15:39] seeing on one hot day
[1:15:41] in samaria there that one of the great
[1:15:43] tourist cities
[1:15:44] of the world that day something on the
[1:15:46] order of would say
[1:15:47] miami or or hollywood los angeles some
[1:15:51] of them places like that some great
[1:15:53] place for tours and we
[1:15:56] can just imagine seeing it never been in
[1:15:58] such a city
[1:15:59] but he had the word of the lord he was
[1:16:02] coming to this great
[1:16:03] uh city where sin was heaped on every
[1:16:07] side
[1:16:08] the ministers that all got away from the
[1:16:09] word of god and they hadn't had a
[1:16:11] prophet in long years and so
[1:16:13] this little fellow as he topped the hill
[1:16:15] just uh
[1:16:16] kind of north of samaria i can imagine
[1:16:19] seeing
[1:16:20] the hot sun shining down his grave
[1:16:22] whiskers over his face his little eyes
[1:16:24] narrowed his little ball head shine as
[1:16:27] he looked down upon that
[1:16:28] city his eyes narrowed he wasn't looking
[1:16:31] at what tourists usually see
[1:16:32] to go to a city to see all of its
[1:16:34] enchantments of beauty
[1:16:36] he looked and seen what a sight that
[1:16:38] that city had become
[1:16:39] a city that once was a city of god and
[1:16:42] had gotten such a
[1:16:43] morally decay is that no wonder this
[1:16:46] little
[1:16:47] unknown fella was amos the prophet
[1:16:50] and now we don't know very much about
[1:16:52] him we don't know where he come from
[1:16:54] prophets usually come on the scene
[1:16:56] unknown leave the same way
[1:16:58] we don't know where they come from where
[1:16:59] they go know about their backgrounds
[1:17:02] god just raises them up he wasn't much
[1:17:05] to look at
[1:17:06] but he had thus saith the lord that's
[1:17:10] the main thing
[1:17:12] of course he come to samaria to begin
[1:17:14] his campaign
[1:17:16] i'm sure he had no cooperation from
[1:17:18] nobody
[1:17:19] he had no fellowship card from any uh
[1:17:22] denomination he had no credentials to
[1:17:24] show what
[1:17:25] group he come from and but he had one
[1:17:28] thing
[1:17:29] he had the word of the lord for that
[1:17:31] city
[1:17:33] and i wonder if we could transport amos
[1:17:36] today
[1:17:37] down to our time i wonder if he'd be
[1:17:40] welcome in our city today
[1:17:42] i wonder if we would receive him or
[1:17:44] would we do just like they did
[1:17:46] we find our cities in the same decay
[1:17:49] and we find that sin is just great among
[1:17:52] the people
[1:17:53] as it was then and i wonder if this
[1:17:56] little unknown
[1:17:57] man how is he going to start this
[1:17:59] campaign how
[1:18:00] where is he going to begin at what
[1:18:02] church is he going to or who's going to
[1:18:03] cooperate with him
[1:18:05] he had nothing to show where he come
[1:18:07] from he had nothing at all but
[1:18:09] thus saith the lord for the city
[1:18:13] he found them so decayed and so morally
[1:18:16] corrupted
[1:18:17] it was a great time the women in that
[1:18:19] city had become
[1:18:21] almost like they are in the united
[1:18:22] states they had become
[1:18:24] corrupt everything that god had expected
[1:18:26] out of them they went right the other
[1:18:28] way
[1:18:29] and and we'd find that it was a great
[1:18:32] place where
[1:18:32] they had dancings on the street the
[1:18:35] women immorally stripping their clothes
[1:18:37] and so forth like
[1:18:38] striptease of course that was a public
[1:18:40] amusement now days now it's every day
[1:18:42] just let the weather get hot and you
[1:18:43] don't have to go to any
[1:18:44] shows you're all on the street anywhere
[1:18:46] anyhow shame on you women to do a thing
[1:18:49] like that
[1:18:50] you ashamed yourself and um and then
[1:18:53] i said that to a woman here not long ago
[1:18:55] and she said why
[1:18:56] she said uh brother branham said that
[1:18:59] that's
[1:19:00] uh uh that's just like the rest of women
[1:19:02] i said but we are not supposed to act
[1:19:03] like the rest of the people
[1:19:05] we are different we are uh a different
[1:19:08] character reminds me of a
[1:19:11] woman said well brother branham another
[1:19:13] said i i don't wear those sharks that i
[1:19:15] wear
[1:19:16] slacks i said that's worse god said it's
[1:19:19] an abomination a sight for a woman to
[1:19:21] put on a garment pertains to a man
[1:19:23] it's exactly right one said well they
[1:19:26] don't make any other clothes they still
[1:19:28] make sewing machines and have goods
[1:19:30] there's no excuse
[1:19:31] it's just what's in the heart that's
[1:19:32] what shows out it it identifies itself
[1:19:36] and now we find in this city it become
[1:19:39] morally decayed the preacher's afraid to
[1:19:41] say anything about it
[1:19:43] and uh but they had a little fellow
[1:19:45] coming up over the hill was coming to
[1:19:46] tell them
[1:19:47] thus saith the lord clean this thing up
[1:19:50] or you're going to
[1:19:51] go into captivity and he lived to see
[1:19:54] the days
[1:19:55] of his prophecy fulfilled he prophesied
[1:19:58] in the days of jeroboam the second which
[1:19:59] was just a
[1:20:00] outcast anyhow he favored the other
[1:20:03] nations and
[1:20:04] and lisa amos prophesied and told him he
[1:20:06] said the very
[1:20:08] god that you claim to serve he'll
[1:20:09] destroy you
[1:20:11] and he did and if his voice would be
[1:20:14] here tonight
[1:20:15] in birmingham it would claim the same
[1:20:17] thing to the churches
[1:20:19] a very god that you claim to serve will
[1:20:22] destroy you someday
[1:20:24] i'm not speaking to this audience here
[1:20:26] these tapes go around the world
[1:20:27] now remember that is true then he found
[1:20:31] out
[1:20:31] when he come into the city that he all
[1:20:34] this stuff i wonder how he must have
[1:20:36] felt to look and see that
[1:20:37] decay of the people of god to whom he
[1:20:40] was sent
[1:20:42] uh i wonder if we would receive him now
[1:20:45] if he'd come in would we
[1:20:46] would we cooperate with him would we
[1:20:48] give him our
[1:20:49] our best would we give him our attention
[1:20:51] would we repent if he told us
[1:20:53] that we should go back to the word of
[1:20:55] the lord and do the way the lord said
[1:20:57] i wonder what our sisters would do about
[1:20:59] their bobbed hair would they let their
[1:21:00] hair grow out again
[1:21:01] if aim is gone he'd preach it now i'm
[1:21:03] telling you that because that's the word
[1:21:04] of the lord
[1:21:05] i wonder if our if our boards have put
[1:21:08] out
[1:21:08] deacons as married three or four times
[1:21:10] and and so forth like that
[1:21:12] trying to be deacons i wonder if all
[1:21:14] these things i wonder what he would do
[1:21:15] to man that would let his wife
[1:21:18] wear sharks and get out in the street
[1:21:19] out there and mow the yard out in the
[1:21:21] yard when
[1:21:22] man is passing by i wonder what he'd say
[1:21:23] to man like that
[1:21:25] amen you certainly blast it with all
[1:21:27] that was in him
[1:21:28] or he had thus saith the lord and he
[1:21:31] couldn't do
[1:21:31] nothing else but that he found them in
[1:21:34] that day with the bad case
[1:21:37] of a disease spiritual uneasy and that's
[1:21:40] just exactly what we got today
[1:21:43] now how did he know what was going to
[1:21:46] happen
[1:21:47] how would amos know first he was a
[1:21:49] prophet
[1:21:50] and the next thing he knowed by the
[1:21:53] disease
[1:21:53] what the diagnosis was and he know what
[1:21:56] the results was
[1:21:57] if a doctor looks upon a malignancy and
[1:22:00] sees that that
[1:22:01] malignant untucker hold he knows there's
[1:22:03] nothing but death left that's all
[1:22:05] unless god does something about it well
[1:22:07] when you look at a city and you look at
[1:22:09] a people
[1:22:10] you look at a church and look at a
[1:22:12] people it's so far away from god
[1:22:15] there isn't nothing but to diagnose but
[1:22:17] sin
[1:22:18] the wages of sin is death it's dying
[1:22:21] the diagnosis proves what it is you see
[1:22:24] when people get away from god and won't
[1:22:25] listen to the word
[1:22:27] have no more desire for the word then
[1:22:28] there's one diagnosis to it
[1:22:30] the soul that sinneth that soul shall
[1:22:32] die
[1:22:33] unbelief shall separate you from god
[1:22:36] that's exactly right
[1:22:38] but he knew what the disease what the
[1:22:39] results was when he seen the disease
[1:22:42] of of sin in the city now
[1:22:46] this amnesia we told it is a a
[1:22:50] cause you to be to a place where you
[1:22:52] can't not
[1:22:53] identify yourself
[1:22:58] now it's an unusual thing it don't
[1:23:01] happen too often
[1:23:02] but the causes is from shock
[1:23:06] it's somebody that don't even know who
[1:23:08] they are they find it from war
[1:23:10] sometimes the soldiers get it sometimes
[1:23:12] people get it
[1:23:13] another thing causes it is weary where
[1:23:16] he will cause it where he has no virtue
[1:23:18] to it at all
[1:23:20] it's it's skip wary accept faith
[1:23:23] someone said well my wife you're going
[1:23:24] to be shot in the morning wouldn't you
[1:23:26] worry i said no
[1:23:27] don't think so why i said worry couldn't
[1:23:30] do enough but make me worse
[1:23:31] well what good is going to do to have
[1:23:32] faith i said it might deliver me yes sir
[1:23:34] see so where he has no virtue to it at
[1:23:37] all but faith has
[1:23:38] all virtue believe now
[1:23:41] weary sometimes calls it and another
[1:23:43] thing that causes among the people
[1:23:45] is getting between two opinions that'll
[1:23:48] cause
[1:23:49] amnesia and it uh gets you to a place
[1:23:52] where you you
[1:23:53] actually what you've done you've lost
[1:23:54] your reasons you've lost your mind
[1:23:57] you can't make you don't know who you
[1:23:58] are you can't identify yourself you can
[1:24:00] walk around
[1:24:01] eat and everything but you still you
[1:24:03] can't identify yourself
[1:24:05] you've got your scholarly education you
[1:24:07] can same education you had but you don't
[1:24:09] know where it come from you don't know
[1:24:10] who you are where you belong that's
[1:24:13] amnesia
[1:24:14] so we're told we are identified
[1:24:18] uh with our families in this human life
[1:24:22] by marriage and with our wives we marry
[1:24:25] and our families identified by the union
[1:24:28] of our
[1:24:29] our marriage and then what
[1:24:33] to think what if this horrible thing
[1:24:35] would happen to you
[1:24:37] and you wouldn't be able to remember
[1:24:40] who you married who's your wife which is
[1:24:43] your children
[1:24:44] who is your father and mother who is
[1:24:46] your neighbor
[1:24:48] that would be a horrible thing then
[1:24:51] we are identified again can identify
[1:24:54] ourselves in the human race by having
[1:24:57] intelligence and being different from
[1:24:59] the animal life
[1:25:00] the animal cannot think he just goes
[1:25:02] with sounds
[1:25:03] he has no soul and but we're animal life
[1:25:07] what makes us different we're a mammal
[1:25:09] but what that mammal is warm blooded
[1:25:11] animal
[1:25:12] and we are in the feature of animal
[1:25:15] but what makes us different we are
[1:25:16] identified by having a
[1:25:18] soul a conscience that tells us what's
[1:25:21] right and wrong
[1:25:22] now there is a place when you get this
[1:25:24] amnesia you might get like
[1:25:26] nebuchadnezzar was who exalted himself
[1:25:28] one time
[1:25:29] and god let him think he was an
[1:25:33] animal and he lived out in the
[1:25:35] wilderness and
[1:25:36] and eat grass like an ox and and his uh
[1:25:40] his hairs grew down his body like eagle
[1:25:42] feathers
[1:25:43] and he become the heart of a beast in
[1:25:46] him
[1:25:47] see that was amnesia
[1:25:50] because he had forgotten that he was a
[1:25:52] king he had forgotten
[1:25:54] that he was a human being and he thought
[1:25:57] he was an animal so he acted
[1:26:00] like an animal amen because he forgot
[1:26:04] he was a human being that's so easy
[1:26:06] today
[1:26:08] and we forget sometimes what the
[1:26:10] christian church is
[1:26:13] we act like the world that shows that we
[1:26:16] got spiritual amnesia
[1:26:18] because you don't act like the christian
[1:26:22] you act like the world you receive the
[1:26:24] heart of the world
[1:26:26] and it causes this here we uh
[1:26:30] we find that israel had exposed
[1:26:34] uh got exposed to the world and it fell
[1:26:36] into this
[1:26:37] rut and this prophet was sent to dig him
[1:26:40] out of it if he could
[1:26:41] and to tell him god by his
[1:26:45] grace chose israel from all the rest of
[1:26:48] the families on the earth
[1:26:50] grace had did that he had given them the
[1:26:53] choice lands
[1:26:55] he gave them houses that they never had
[1:26:57] to build
[1:26:58] god did that chose them he gave them
[1:27:02] farms that they never bought he
[1:27:05] he gave them he gave them food that they
[1:27:08] never planted
[1:27:09] you gave them wells that they never dug
[1:27:12] you gave them victories
[1:27:14] that they never won he gave them grace
[1:27:16] that they never merited
[1:27:18] god did that by his grace for this
[1:27:22] people
[1:27:24] israel his chosen his beloved
[1:27:28] and he said in the bible he found her in
[1:27:29] the field as a little girl
[1:27:31] sitting in her own blood and he washed
[1:27:33] her and cleaned her up
[1:27:34] and what he did but after god showed all
[1:27:37] these
[1:27:38] mercies to her and she got rich she got
[1:27:41] amnesia and these and she forgot
[1:27:44] all about where these things come from
[1:27:48] i think that's a picture of usa 1964.
[1:27:55] it's suffering with the same disease
[1:27:57] we're great powerful churches
[1:27:59] we're a great powerful people we're
[1:28:02] millions in number
[1:28:04] and we'll forget where these things come
[1:28:06] from
[1:28:08] they had a bad case of it after god had
[1:28:11] been good to him and brought him up
[1:28:12] from all the heathen lands and made him
[1:28:15] a separated people
[1:28:16] separated them to himself he said he
[1:28:19] took a vine out of another country and
[1:28:21] planted over in another country
[1:28:23] and how he fixed it around to make it
[1:28:25] grow fruit
[1:28:27] and be fruitful but the vine
[1:28:30] forgot where its blessings come from
[1:28:33] so has god's people in these last days
[1:28:37] has forgotten what the testimony
[1:28:40] of being a christian means amen
[1:28:44] it's again this amnesia has become upon
[1:28:47] the people
[1:28:48] they can't identify themselves they um
[1:28:52] they forgot all about it they forgot his
[1:28:55] holiness
[1:28:56] they had forgotten his law the women
[1:28:58] were living like the rest of the women
[1:29:00] god's church and his people has always
[1:29:03] been a
[1:29:04] separated people a called out people a
[1:29:06] peculiar people
[1:29:07] a holy nation a royal priesthood
[1:29:10] offering spiritual sacrifices to god the
[1:29:13] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[1:29:14] his name
[1:29:16] god called his church and separated from
[1:29:18] the world
[1:29:19] for that very purpose and he given a law
[1:29:23] and he it must be holy he said i
[1:29:26] am holy and you must be holy and without
[1:29:29] holiness
[1:29:30] no man shall see the lord god said that
[1:29:33] himself
[1:29:34] and he called this people to be this
[1:29:36] type of people
[1:29:38] but they had forgotten about it they had
[1:29:41] forgotten his laws
[1:29:42] and they'd forgotten their morals the
[1:29:45] women out in the street israelite women
[1:29:47] out there each one expecting to to be
[1:29:51] conceived by the holy spirit to bring
[1:29:53] forth a messiah
[1:29:54] and then acting like that their
[1:29:56] character was
[1:29:57] terrible i want to stop here a minute to
[1:30:00] say
[1:30:00] it's the same thing among our peoples
[1:30:02] today who call themselves christians
[1:30:04] their character if you would only
[1:30:07] realize
[1:30:08] one time in the south i read a story
[1:30:10] from down here where
[1:30:11] when they used to have slaves they'd
[1:30:13] take those people and
[1:30:15] sell them on the market just like you
[1:30:16] would a used car and then
[1:30:18] there was a buyer a broker who would
[1:30:20] come by and pick up these slaves and
[1:30:22] trade them and just like you would a car
[1:30:23] or something and
[1:30:25] those slaves was away from their home
[1:30:27] country
[1:30:28] they were from africa the boers uh
[1:30:30] kidnapped him
[1:30:31] brought him over here to the islands and
[1:30:33] then smuggled into the united states and
[1:30:35] sold them
[1:30:36] for slaves from not jamaica and around
[1:30:39] now we find that those people were sad
[1:30:42] they had been kidnapped from their own
[1:30:44] home they've been taken out by an enemy
[1:30:47] and they were sad they'd never see their
[1:30:49] husband no more their wife no more their
[1:30:51] father mother their children
[1:30:53] they were absolutely they had to whip
[1:30:55] them with whips to make them work
[1:30:56] for they were sad people and one day
[1:31:00] a broker came by a certain plantation he
[1:31:02] saw a bunch of slaves out there working
[1:31:04] and
[1:31:04] he went in and asked the owner said how
[1:31:06] many slaves you got said about a hundred
[1:31:08] said you got in it you swap or sell he
[1:31:10] said yep
[1:31:11] said let me look him over and he went
[1:31:13] out the field and watched him and
[1:31:14] he seen him have to whip him around and
[1:31:16] that's why he saw one young man that
[1:31:18] didn't have to whip
[1:31:19] he had his chest out his chin up didn't
[1:31:22] have to whip him
[1:31:23] so the broker said i'd like to buy that
[1:31:26] slave
[1:31:27] and he said but he's not for sale he
[1:31:30] said
[1:31:30] uh well what's the difference of that
[1:31:32] slave said is that slave the boss or the
[1:31:34] rest of me said no
[1:31:36] he's just a slave he said well maybe you
[1:31:39] feed him different
[1:31:40] he said no he eats in the galley with
[1:31:42] the rest of the slaves
[1:31:44] he said well what makes him so different
[1:31:46] from the rest of the slaves
[1:31:47] he said well this i wanted to for a long
[1:31:50] time
[1:31:50] but one day i learned that over in the
[1:31:53] homeland where he come from
[1:31:56] his father is the king of the whole
[1:31:58] tribe
[1:31:59] and though he be an alien and away from
[1:32:01] home
[1:32:02] yet he knows he's the son of a king and
[1:32:05] he
[1:32:05] he conducts himself like the son of a
[1:32:09] king
[1:32:09] i thought but that if a negro coming
[1:32:12] from africa
[1:32:13] and noted his father was a tribesman and
[1:32:15] a king over a tribe
[1:32:17] what order to do to a christian that's
[1:32:19] borned again a man or woman
[1:32:22] that our father is a king of heaven and
[1:32:24] glory we should conduct
[1:32:26] ourselves as christian men and women we
[1:32:29] should act like a dress like it talk
[1:32:30] like it live like it
[1:32:32] though we be an alien yet we are a
[1:32:34] children of the king
[1:32:35] amen our character our
[1:32:38] demoralization in the days that we're
[1:32:40] living in now
[1:32:42] israel had dropped into that same rut
[1:32:45] and was all so immoral they forgot the
[1:32:48] laws of god thou shalt not commit
[1:32:50] adultery and i shall not covet thy
[1:32:52] neighbor's wife
[1:32:53] and so forth they'd forgotten those laws
[1:32:56] they
[1:32:56] they they didn't want it anymore and
[1:32:58] they uh they wanted to
[1:33:00] to be like the rest of the world just
[1:33:02] like the church has got today
[1:33:04] one time israel when he started wanting
[1:33:06] to have a king over it
[1:33:08] samuel told him the prophet which was
[1:33:10] sent to them
[1:33:11] he said now have i ever told you
[1:33:13] anything in the name of the lord but
[1:33:15] what come to pass they said no
[1:33:16] you haven't did i ever beg you for my
[1:33:19] food and money
[1:33:20] for your money to for me to live on no
[1:33:22] you haven't done that
[1:33:23] you never told us nothing samuel but
[1:33:24] what come to pass and you've never asked
[1:33:26] us for our money
[1:33:28] for your living but yet we want the king
[1:33:31] anyhow
[1:33:33] god said to samuel let them have him
[1:33:35] they didn't turn you down they turned me
[1:33:37] down
[1:33:39] israel had gotten that same shape now
[1:33:42] they didn't want god's prophets no more
[1:33:44] they didn't need them and if one would
[1:33:47] come and bring him the word and try to
[1:33:49] bring him back to the word they would
[1:33:50] reject it
[1:33:51] amen they always do it in that manner of
[1:33:54] corruption
[1:33:55] when the world and the church joins
[1:33:57] itself together
[1:33:59] then they don't want nothing spiritual
[1:34:01] they don't want thus saith the lord
[1:34:05] they want what they want they want the
[1:34:07] world and to say they're a christian and
[1:34:09] live in the world and live with the
[1:34:10] world and live like the world and still
[1:34:13] maintain their confession of being a
[1:34:15] christian
[1:34:16] you know the thing of this is spiritual
[1:34:18] amnesia that's exactly what it is
[1:34:20] they don't know who they are they've
[1:34:22] forgotten that what they're supposed to
[1:34:23] do
[1:34:25] if one would come today like that it
[1:34:27] would be rejected yes the same
[1:34:29] they had a bad case of it and so have
[1:34:32] they today
[1:34:33] they cannot identify themselves with the
[1:34:35] supernatural things
[1:34:36] anymore because they didn't want it the
[1:34:39] word the gospel
[1:34:41] they didn't want it sin disease had
[1:34:44] afflicted them
[1:34:45] and they loved that sin
[1:34:48] is pleasant to the unconverted heart
[1:34:52] it looks good to the unconverted mind
[1:34:55] but it's a way of death there's nothing
[1:34:57] left but
[1:34:58] death the wages of sin is death and you
[1:35:01] must
[1:35:02] reap them wages you've sowed to the
[1:35:04] winds and not
[1:35:05] reaping the whirlwind the spiritual
[1:35:08] signs and the preaching
[1:35:10] of an ordained messenger from god never
[1:35:12] stirred them anymore
[1:35:14] the women could laugh right their face
[1:35:16] and say i don't have to go hear such a
[1:35:17] stuff as that
[1:35:18] if that hasn't repeated again
[1:35:22] what is it spiritual amnesia exactly
[1:35:25] what it is
[1:35:26] they have forgotten that god and his
[1:35:29] word is the same and he cannot change it
[1:35:32] amen if the prophet rose on the scene in
[1:35:35] them days and give a spiritual sign
[1:35:37] a spiritual voice and get the voice of
[1:35:39] god behind it they'd only laugh at it
[1:35:41] and make fun of it
[1:35:42] you know the old sand fools will walk
[1:35:44] with hobnailed shoes
[1:35:45] where angels fear to try that's what
[1:35:49] this spiritual amnesia does
[1:35:51] makes people get to a spot to work they
[1:35:53] have no feeling on the inside of them
[1:35:55] they don't want nothing that's spiritual
[1:35:58] take a real spiritual meeting
[1:36:00] where the holy spirit's healing is sick
[1:36:02] and discerning the thoughts that's in
[1:36:03] the heart
[1:36:04] and put it in among all the churches
[1:36:06] it's a great rally out here in this
[1:36:07] stadium
[1:36:08] and look what would happen in a few
[1:36:09] minutes everybody be getting up walking
[1:36:11] out
[1:36:11] they have nothing to do with it they
[1:36:13] don't want nothing to do with it
[1:36:15] they'll listen to some intellectual talk
[1:36:17] but when it comes to the power
[1:36:18] of jesus christ and his resurrection and
[1:36:21] the holy ghost they want nothing to do
[1:36:23] with it because it condemns them
[1:36:25] it sets them a fire but the thing that
[1:36:28] they ought to know
[1:36:30] no chastisement of course is pleasant
[1:36:32] for the season but
[1:36:34] if you yield to it it it brings the
[1:36:36] fruits of
[1:36:37] repentance so we find out when this
[1:36:39] spiritual amnesia
[1:36:40] get a hold to the people then they are
[1:36:43] they're in a bad condition
[1:36:44] now we find the same now now i want to
[1:36:47] you must be identified somewhere you
[1:36:50] must
[1:36:50] show your life shows tonight
[1:36:53] where you are identified you are
[1:36:56] identified either in christ or out of
[1:36:59] christ
[1:37:00] you are not halfway there's no such a
[1:37:03] thing as a drunk sober man
[1:37:05] there's no black white bird you're
[1:37:07] either a saved or you're
[1:37:09] not saved you're a saint or a sinner one
[1:37:12] of the other
[1:37:13] and your spiritual attitude towards
[1:37:15] god's word
[1:37:16] identifies you exactly where you're
[1:37:19] standing
[1:37:20] god's word vindicated proved
[1:37:24] that the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:37:25] just the same as it ever was on the day
[1:37:27] of pentecost or any other time
[1:37:29] and jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:37:31] forever and your
[1:37:33] attitude towards that identifies whether
[1:37:35] you have spiritual
[1:37:36] amnesia or not amen right
[1:37:39] no matter if you're a deacon even if
[1:37:41] you're a preacher it doesn't make you
[1:37:43] they get a two
[1:37:44] so we find out it's contagious and hits
[1:37:47] the whole thing
[1:37:48] now we notice now to be an american
[1:37:51] to be american i must be identified with
[1:37:54] my nation

[1:45:13] i was with moses when he crossed the red
[1:45:15] sea
[1:45:16] when he raised his hand and walked
[1:45:18] forward and the red sea
[1:45:19] opened i was identified in christ right
[1:45:22] then
[1:45:22] and i was with moses at that hour
[1:45:25] whatever christians has been
[1:45:27] whatever believers has been every
[1:45:29] believer now is identified with that
[1:45:31] same person
[1:45:32] whatever it is you must be identified
[1:45:35] don't forget that
[1:45:36] when you do you got spiritual amnesia
[1:45:40] you've forgotten who you are amen now
[1:45:43] identified with him
[1:45:44] with moses when he crossed the sea i was
[1:45:47] with elijah
[1:45:49] in the days of ahab when they had to
[1:45:51] make a choice
[1:45:53] who they would serve god our balaam
[1:45:57] we was with him on mount carmel when he
[1:46:00] had to make this
[1:46:01] choice for we are identified
[1:46:04] in the body of the same god that he was
[1:46:07] identified in
[1:46:09] so if we are identified in that body
[1:46:11] then we must remember
[1:46:12] we were there with him
[1:46:16] right now i was with david when he was
[1:46:20] rejected by his own brethren
[1:46:23] i was with david you are too if you're a
[1:46:25] christian
[1:46:26] you have to be identified in his
[1:46:28] rejection
[1:46:31] i was with the hebrew children in the
[1:46:33] fiery furnace
[1:46:35] when the the fire couldn't burn because
[1:46:38] of the presence of the fourth man
[1:46:41] i was with daniel in the lion's den i
[1:46:43] was identified in there
[1:46:45] when the angel of the lord identified
[1:46:48] him in there
[1:46:50] i most surely was with him at calvary
[1:46:52] amen
[1:46:54] i must be identified with him at calvary
[1:46:58] i must be there to a place that were not
[1:47:01] also was identified with him at calvary
[1:47:03] i
[1:47:04] died with him at calvary every christian
[1:47:07] must die with him at calvary
[1:47:09] if you don't die with him at calvary you
[1:47:11] can't be none of his
[1:47:12] i was there when he died i died with him
[1:47:16] and then i was with him when he raised
[1:47:18] up from the dead
[1:47:20] i come up on easter morning with him in
[1:47:22] the resurrection
[1:47:23] whatever he did i was right there with
[1:47:25] him every believer was the same
[1:47:28] and now i am seated with him in heavenly
[1:47:31] places
[1:47:32] in christ jesus with all the powers of
[1:47:35] hell conquered to him
[1:47:37] every christian believer was seated the
[1:47:39] same way
[1:47:40] because you have to be identified now i
[1:47:43] find myself in this last days
[1:47:46] with many of the believing christians
[1:47:48] identified in his ministry
[1:47:50] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:47:52] forever
[1:47:54] i find myself in this day identified in
[1:47:56] his ministry
[1:47:58] do you find yourself that way believing
[1:48:00] it walking with it
[1:48:02] notice the works that he did he said the
[1:48:05] believer would do the same thing
[1:48:08] the works that i do shall you also then
[1:48:11] can you be identified with him then
[1:48:13] when the reproach comes on the word can
[1:48:16] you stand the reproach
[1:48:18] like he did see identified with him i
[1:48:21] was
[1:48:21] identified with him i was with him at
[1:48:23] the day of pentecost
[1:48:25] i was with the disciples up there
[1:48:28] identified with them
[1:48:29] in the baptism of the holy ghost i
[1:48:31] wonder if the church
[1:48:32] hasn't got amnesia so much now that they
[1:48:35] don't some of them don't even believe
[1:48:36] there is such a thing as the holy ghost
[1:48:39] see where the church has got a very bad
[1:48:41] case of
[1:48:42] amnesia see they have forgotten that
[1:48:45] that was jesus
[1:48:46] christ back there they have forgotten
[1:48:48] what jesus christ was
[1:48:50] they have forgotten they thought he was
[1:48:51] just a a lawmaker or a
[1:48:54] prophet or a good man they forgot that
[1:48:56] he was god
[1:48:58] they forgot that he's the same yesterday
[1:49:00] and forever and the church has got a bad
[1:49:02] case of spiritual
[1:49:03] amnesia they have forgotten all these
[1:49:06] things
[1:49:07] they don't understand it no more we must
[1:49:09] be with the disciples at pentecost
[1:49:11] identify with them i was identified with
[1:49:14] peter's sermon on the day of pentecost
[1:49:16] in acts the second chapter i heard what
[1:49:19] he said
[1:49:20] i believe what he said i obeyed what he
[1:49:22] said now i'm identified in the same
[1:49:24] thing
[1:49:25] amen don't get spiritual amnesia
[1:49:29] because you will you identify yourself
[1:49:30] with something else stay right with that
[1:49:32] word
[1:49:33] whereas with the church when it was
[1:49:35] commissioned by jesus christ
[1:49:37] in acts the 16th chapter go into all the
[1:49:39] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:49:41] creature
[1:49:42] i want to be identified there all the
[1:49:44] world to every creature
[1:49:46] these signs shall follow them that
[1:49:49] believe
[1:49:51] can be identified in that well are you
[1:49:53] identified with that or have you got
[1:49:55] some spiritual
[1:49:56] amnesia that you find out you don't
[1:49:58] believe those signs follow the believers
[1:50:01] see if you don't believe it then you
[1:50:03] have spiritual amnesia
[1:50:05] see you've forgotten if god promised
[1:50:07] that he said these signs
[1:50:09] shall follow them that believe don't
[1:50:12] forget it
[1:50:13] you can't forget it to be a christian
[1:50:16] you must be identified with it
[1:50:18] you must be identified with saint john
[1:50:20] the 14th chapter the 12th verse
[1:50:22] he that believeth in me the works that i
[1:50:24] do
[1:50:25] shall he do also don't forget it
[1:50:29] if you do then you've got spiritual
[1:50:32] amnesia
[1:50:33] you've forgotten who you are you've

[1:50:41] word in you you can ask what you will
[1:50:43] it will be done for you are you
[1:50:45] identified there to believe it that is
[1:50:47] the truth
[1:50:48] mark 11 when he said if you say to this
[1:50:50] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:50:51] your heart
[1:50:52] but believe that what you have said will
[1:50:54] come to pass you can have what you said
[1:50:56] can you be identified there to believe
[1:50:58] it that is the truth
[1:51:00] if it hasn't then you're getting
[1:51:01] spiritual amnesia amen
[1:51:03] and it you forget you lose your
[1:51:06] christian balance you can't tell where
[1:51:09] you belong
[1:51:10] you say i'm methodist i'm baptist that's
[1:51:12] what i know about it i'm pentecostal i'm
[1:51:14] this side of the other
[1:51:15] watch out that may mean the disease sign
[1:51:18] is showing on you
[1:51:19] that you've got some spiritual amnesia
[1:51:22] you say well brother branham i i believe
[1:51:24] this now i don't hardly
[1:51:25] now wait just a minute if god promised
[1:51:28] to do these things and said they'd be in
[1:51:30] the last days
[1:51:31] and your creed will keep you from that's
[1:51:34] a good sign i can see
[1:51:35] the disease sign on you it's spiritual
[1:51:39] amnesia you've forgotten to identify
[1:51:42] yourself
[1:51:43] amen amen you say i don't believe that
[1:51:47] the sick are healed
[1:51:48] you've got spiritual amnesia you see i
[1:51:51] don't believe in the baptism of the holy
[1:51:53] ghost spiritual amnesia
[1:51:55] he said i i don't believe that god
[1:51:57] promised to do these things in the last
[1:51:59] days then
[1:51:59] you've listened to a creed or some
[1:52:01] doctrine instead of the bible
[1:52:03] you have spiritual amnesia you don't
[1:52:06] know where you do belong man
[1:52:07] you're confessing a christian and
[1:52:09] denying the word
[1:52:11] brings you right back to spiritual
[1:52:12] amnesia again
[1:52:14] don't know where you stand you got
[1:52:16] spiritual amnesia
[1:52:18] you can't identify yourself with the
[1:52:20] scriptures you have to be with the
[1:52:22] disciples you have to be with all the
[1:52:23] scripture
[1:52:25] with the church when it's commissioned
[1:52:26] but now when the church was commissioned
[1:52:29] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:52:30] gospel these
[1:52:32] signs shall follow them and believe that
[1:52:35] was her commission
[1:52:37] now they have that was the commission
[1:52:40] but they have
[1:52:40] gotten a bad case of this spiritual
[1:52:43] amnesia just like
[1:52:44] eve got on the on her around through the
[1:52:47] garden one day
[1:52:50] now she's like israel suffering from
[1:52:52] this same disease
[1:52:54] an allergy from a seminary diet that'll
[1:52:58] give you spiritual amnesia
[1:53:00] get some seminary diet and you'll get an
[1:53:03] allergy
[1:53:04] and then the first thing you know you'll
[1:53:05] get amnesia real bad you don't believe
[1:53:07] anything the bible says
[1:53:09] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:53:11] today that's what's a matter we can't
[1:53:12] have revival today
[1:53:14] that's what's the matter with the people
[1:53:15] they've been so drug over coals of
[1:53:17] everything and ever
[1:53:18] ism that can hatch up till they don't
[1:53:20] know what is right and wrong
[1:53:23] exactly she can't remember her lord
[1:53:26] she can't remember his word she can't
[1:53:29] remember the promise
[1:53:30] that was what was the matter with israel
[1:53:32] when jesus come on the scene
[1:53:34] they could not remember that a virgin
[1:53:36] shall conceive
[1:53:38] they could not remember that moses said
[1:53:40] the lord your god shall raise up a
[1:53:41] prophet like an enemy amen
[1:53:43] they had spiritual amnesia that's
[1:53:46] exactly what the church has got today
[1:53:48] he said it shall come to pass in the
[1:53:50] last days that these things would take
[1:53:52] place that we should take
[1:53:56] amen what is it spiritual amnesia amen
[1:54:00] we call ourselves pentecostal divine and
[1:54:02] can't
[1:54:03] identify ourselves in the world
[1:54:10] and doing exactly what he said he would
[1:54:11] do then watch out
[1:54:14] our denominational system has got us
[1:54:15] into spiritual amnesia
[1:54:18] we're suffering we don't know where we
[1:54:19] belong one takes his papers from this
[1:54:22] church to the other church in this
[1:54:23] church and this is him and that ism
[1:54:25] see what we need again is another amos
[1:54:28] to come on the scene
[1:54:29] with thus saith the lord amen
[1:54:34] but we receive him not like they did
[1:54:36] they never received him they wouldn't
[1:54:37] receive him today
[1:54:39] he couldn't get his head in a place
[1:54:41] hardly to preach now that's exactly
[1:54:43] right because the church is suffering
[1:54:45] with this spiritual amnesia now why
[1:54:48] god promised in this last days when the
[1:54:51] son of man would be revealed according
[1:54:52] to luke 17
[1:54:53] chapter that the sign it was taking
[1:54:56] place in sodom
[1:54:57] would take place again and the people
[1:54:59] see it done
[1:55:00] and some of them don't even believe it
[1:55:03] they think it's telepathy they think
[1:55:05] it's a devil spirit
[1:55:06] what is it they're suffering with
[1:55:08] spiritual amnesia
[1:55:11] exactly they can't understand the lord
[1:55:13] jesus christ is the same
[1:55:15] yesterday today and forever what he was
[1:55:17] than he is now
[1:55:19] amen but what's happened just can't
[1:55:22] identify herself no more with a word
[1:55:24] why she she don't know whether she's a
[1:55:26] lodge or whether she's a church
[1:55:29] she don't want to be called a lodge and
[1:55:30] she can't be called a church
[1:55:32] of course be called a church would
[1:55:34] identify herself with christ that gives
[1:55:35] her spiritual amnesia and she don't want
[1:55:37] to be called a lodge
[1:55:38] so it ain't the pentecostal church of
[1:55:40] methodist church the baptist church it's
[1:55:42] a pentecost to lodge methodist lodge and
[1:55:43] baptist lodge
[1:55:44] because you can't be identified with the
[1:55:46] word and when the words made manifest
[1:55:49] they still
[1:55:49] don't believe it disease spiritual
[1:55:52] amnesia
[1:55:54] can't identify themselves they don't
[1:55:55] know where they belong
[1:55:57] that's right it's just exactly like
[1:56:00] hybriding something
[1:56:02] as i've often said i always thought one
[1:56:04] of the most
[1:56:05] dumbest things i've ever seen was a mule
[1:56:08] see he's a hybrid
[1:56:10] see his mother was a mare his daddy was
[1:56:12] a donkey
[1:56:13] and he don't even know where he belongs
[1:56:15] and the first thing you know you
[1:56:17] you you can breed him and get a donkey
[1:56:19] and then or get the mule
[1:56:21] but the mule can't breed itself back
[1:56:22] again see
[1:56:24] he don't you can't teach him nothing
[1:56:26] he's hard-headed
[1:56:28] you'll never tell anything you accept
[1:56:29] that big long ears and he'll wait the
[1:56:31] longest day of his life just before he
[1:56:32] dies to kick you
[1:56:34] that's all he's always waiting for
[1:56:36] something to bust it on you if you can
[1:56:38] that puts it in mind a lot of so-called
[1:56:40] hybrid christians
[1:56:41] that have breathed into church until
[1:56:43] they got the disease a spiritual
[1:56:44] adhesive
[1:56:45] they can't reproduce nothing again you
[1:56:48] talk about hybrid corn
[1:56:50] hybrid corn is nothing it's the worst
[1:56:51] thing you ever put in your mouth
[1:56:52] anything hybrid
[1:56:55] that's the reason you have to take these
[1:56:56] little hot bed plants and hybrid stuff
[1:56:58] and spray it and
[1:56:59] doctor it and baby why because it can't
[1:57:02] keep the bugs off of it
[1:57:03] but a genuine thoroughbred you don't
[1:57:06] have no disinfect on him
[1:57:12] they keep the bugs of unbelief off a
[1:57:15] real genuine
[1:57:16] spirited man take it on you and
[1:57:19] you're going to talk to him say say boy
[1:57:21] i want you to do this are you saying
[1:57:22] huh years working them down
[1:57:26] i've seen a lot of christians about like
[1:57:28] that so called
[1:57:30] you say jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:57:32] and forever these signs shall follow
[1:57:33] that belief
[1:57:34] oh i believe the days of miracles has
[1:57:36] passed ha
[1:57:37] see he don't know what he does amen
[1:57:41] where he comes from he don't know where
[1:57:42] he's going
[1:57:47] he's got horse amnesia
[1:57:50] you don't know where he come from he
[1:57:52] can't go no farther
[1:57:53] but i like a genuine thoroughbred oh
[1:57:56] he's gentle you can talk to him
[1:57:58] he knows who his papa was who his mama
[1:58:00] was or his grandpa and grandma was
[1:58:02] he's got pedigreed papers to show where
[1:58:04] he come from not like a petty greek
[1:58:06] christian
[1:58:07] that can go all the way back to the word
[1:58:09] of god to the day of faith
[1:58:10] and identify themselves with the faith
[1:58:13] for the power of the holy ghost came
[1:58:15] upon them
[1:58:16] that's a pedigreed christian he knows
[1:58:19] where he comes from he's not identified
[1:58:20] with methodist baptists or nothing else
[1:58:22] he's identifying god's word he knows
[1:58:25] exactly where he's standing with us
[1:58:28] the royal blood of his father flows to
[1:58:30] him
[1:58:31] the blood of jesus christ he knows what
[1:58:34] it does he believes every word
[1:58:36] god works stream and confirms it with
[1:58:38] the signs that he promised to follow
[1:58:40] he hasn't got no spiritual amnesia he's
[1:58:43] a genuine
[1:58:45] thoroughbred i like that but the church
[1:58:48] today has got a bad case of spiritual
[1:58:50] amnesia
[1:58:50] it doesn't know where it belongs just
[1:58:52] forgot all about it forgot all these
[1:58:54] things it makes it a church
[1:58:56] what made us so rich as we are it's got
[1:58:58] into the place
[1:58:59] of ladies again back into that rich
[1:59:02] place like israel was
[1:59:03] when it was poor and had to trust god
[1:59:05] for everything he could do everything
[1:59:07] that god had trusted god
[1:59:08] then god was with it and he was
[1:59:10] spiritually moved on
[1:59:11] but when he got rich here's what
[1:59:13] happened their cities build up and their
[1:59:16] women got immoral
[1:59:17] their man permitted it their preachers
[1:59:19] let down the bar
[1:59:21] and they denounced the prophets and
[1:59:23] that's the kind of a condition they got
[1:59:25] into
[1:59:26] what caused that to forgive where that
[1:59:28] blessings come from
[1:59:30] amen are you methodists are you baptists
[1:59:32] are you presbyterian
[1:59:34] you methodist and remember john wesley
[1:59:38] your baptist of the john smith went for
[1:59:40] the
[1:59:42] affairs of people until his wife would
[1:59:44] have to lead him to the table his eyes
[1:59:46] swelled shut from crying and praying all
[1:59:48] night long
[1:59:51] what's the matter john wesley said that
[1:59:53] one of the great things
[1:59:55] i believe it was one of the early method
[1:59:56] his father said the disgrace of the
[1:59:59] daughters of the methodist church was
[2:00:01] beginning to get so early they were
[2:00:02] wearing rings upon their finger
[2:00:04] what would he say now with sharks on
[2:00:06] them what happened
[2:00:08] spiritual episode that's right exactly
[2:00:12] what it is
[2:00:12] for god where you come from you've got
[2:00:16] all these things because
[2:00:17] god's given this goodness did to you do
[2:00:20] you think this is a strange thing
[2:00:21] it's exactly with the spirit of jesus
[2:00:23] christ the prophecy
[2:00:25] and revelation is the third chapter it
[2:00:27] said because thou
[2:00:28] says i am rich i have need and nothing
[2:00:32] and know not that thou art poor blind
[2:00:36] wretched miserable naked and don't do it
[2:00:40] see don't know it what is it spiritual
[2:00:43] amnesia
[2:00:44] amen they don't know it right the church
[2:00:48] has got the money now there's not a
[2:00:50] church
[2:00:51] heart in the country a denominational
[2:00:53] what's worth millions
[2:00:54] times millions of dollars building
[2:00:56] millions and millions of dollars in
[2:00:58] buildings and things and preaching the
[2:00:59] coming of the lord is at hand
[2:01:00] [Music]
[2:01:02] rich and said i have need for nothing
[2:01:06] the best educated preachers they ever
[2:01:09] had
[2:01:10] no more theology than they ever known
[2:01:13] and they got the biggest buildings
[2:01:14] the best selected places in the city
[2:01:17] they got the right away to anything they
[2:01:18] want to do
[2:01:19] and then what did they do got spiritual
[2:01:22] amnesia
[2:01:22] and forgot that it was god that done
[2:01:24] that for him
[2:01:26] just like israel and the bible
[2:01:28] prophesied jesus christ
[2:01:29] sent his angel to john and said this
[2:01:32] church age would
[2:01:33] have this spiritual amnesia they were
[2:01:35] wretched remember they think they're
[2:01:37] beings
[2:01:38] they think they've got something but he
[2:01:40] said they were
[2:01:41] miserable wretched poor
[2:01:44] blind naked and fitted out
[2:01:47] yeah there's no way to tell them now if
[2:01:50] a man was out here on the street
[2:01:52] disgraced or a woman naked on the street
[2:01:56] blind that would be a pitiful shape to
[2:01:58] be in that shape
[2:02:00] but then if they had their right mind
[2:02:02] know who they was that they was a human
[2:02:04] being
[2:02:05] and they're supposed to wear clothes
[2:02:07] when you go out there
[2:02:08] they're human beings supposed to be
[2:02:09] identified with human race
[2:02:11] and out there wretched miserable blind
[2:02:13] and naked
[2:02:14] and you go to him said brother you're
[2:02:16] naked now here i'm doctor so and so you
[2:02:18] just
[2:02:19] abandon your own business i'll tell you
[2:02:21] i belong to someone so you ain't got no
[2:02:23] business you holy roller tell me nothing
[2:02:33] [Applause]
[2:02:38] what is it it's a forgotten the lord
[2:02:41] jesus christ
[2:02:43] they better come down and do the signs
[2:02:46] and wonders that he said he would do
[2:02:47] they don't want to believe it right with
[2:02:49] spiritual amnesia
[2:02:51] say they have forgotten and they're
[2:02:54] made and don't know it don't
[2:02:58] realize that they think just because
[2:02:59] i've gone to church that's always
[2:03:01] necessary oh brother that means
[2:03:03] more to god than to be a mason or
[2:03:04] anything else
[2:03:06] any other life upon the church that
[2:03:08] don't mean nothing to god
[2:03:10] you've got to be sons and daughters of
[2:03:12] god
[2:03:14] [Applause]
[2:03:18] when i become part of my father i become
[2:03:20] all my father
[2:03:21] when you become part of god you become
[2:03:23] god and full his whole word you believe
[2:03:25] all of it
[2:03:26] amen amnesia what if you didn't know
[2:03:29] your name was what it was
[2:03:32] if you are you'll come from a fine
[2:03:34] family which i hope you did
[2:03:36] if you come from a fine family people
[2:03:38] and what if you forget
[2:03:40] that family name and you guys are living
[2:03:42] disgraceful
[2:03:43] they say aren't your name jones or
[2:03:45] whatever i don't know who i was
[2:03:47] see all right see that's a horrible
[2:03:50] thing to be
[2:03:51] a horrible condition to get into well
[2:03:53] that's just where the church is gone
[2:03:55] it's supposed to be the representation
[2:03:57] of jesus christ
[2:03:58] yes but it's forgot that because it's
[2:04:00] got injected into it
[2:04:02] creeds and denominations that they've
[2:04:05] accepted that instead of the
[2:04:09] blind word and don't know what is no way
[2:04:11] to tell them
[2:04:13] right i may never be in birmingham again
[2:04:16] but this is one time to go hear it
[2:04:19] right i'm just i'm not
[2:04:22] responsible for another sowing seed
[2:04:26] god directs it to the ground we're
[2:04:27] supposed to go amen
[2:04:29] for god yes they forgot the word of the
[2:04:32] promise
[2:04:33] they forgot israel is that kind of
[2:04:35] effects when jesus come
[2:04:36] it had forgot they looked well they said
[2:04:38] they believe there's coming a messiah
[2:04:40] but the messiah come and identified
[2:04:42] himself by the word
[2:04:45] they had so many traditions to them made
[2:04:47] the word of god of no effect
[2:04:50] and jesus promised just before the
[2:04:53] end time if it wasn't sudden so would it
[2:04:56] be and if he
[2:04:57] identified it the people so traditional
[2:05:00] to invade the promise of god of no
[2:05:02] effect by their tradition
[2:05:04] spiritual amnesia spiritual amnesia is
[2:05:08] exactly what it is
[2:05:09] see they have forgotten these things oh
[2:05:11] i belong to this i i've done this i've
[2:05:13] danced in the spirit i
[2:05:14] did this one my my that has nothing to
[2:05:16] do with it
[2:05:17] not at all how can you be a christian
[2:05:20] and deny the word
[2:05:22] you can't do it god is the word the
[2:05:24] words in you you and the word are the
[2:05:26] same
[2:05:26] all the word is you are amen
[2:05:30] if i'm living in this generation what
[2:05:32] this
[2:05:39] all that the bible preaches and stands
[2:05:41] for hallelujah
[2:05:43] [Music]
[2:05:44] already i feel pretty religious right
[2:05:49] i've got to be identified with
[2:05:51] everything that that bible claims
[2:05:54] and give it claims and if i haven't been
[2:05:57] stricken with this modern day
[2:05:59] spiritual amnesia i am will be and can't
[2:06:02] be identified with him
[2:06:05] by the night then i've got spiritual
[2:06:07] amnesia
[2:06:08] something has happened i've accepted a
[2:06:11] creed or a doctrine or some church
[2:06:12] or a group a man i can't do it when yet
[2:06:15] the word comes and identifies itself
[2:06:17] that's why jesus wasn't recognized oh
[2:06:20] they say well this man's holy
[2:06:22] there's our holy priests our holy this
[2:06:24] and jesus said you're of your father the
[2:06:26] devil
[2:06:27] and his works you'll do did you know
[2:06:28] cain offered a good sacrifice too he was
[2:06:31] sincere
[2:06:32] build an altar and held down in worship
[2:06:34] and offered a sacrifice and prayed to
[2:06:36] god
[2:06:37] and if god that's all god requires you
[2:06:39] to belong to church and have an altar
[2:06:40] and pay your tithes and
[2:06:41] go to church and live a good life if
[2:06:43] that's all he requires he was unjust to
[2:06:45] condemn king because he did the same
[2:06:47] thing
[2:06:48] amen yes exactly but religion means a
[2:06:52] covering
[2:06:53] and you can't be covered by your own
[2:06:55] good works there's only one thing that
[2:06:57] god will
[2:06:58] accept and that's the blood of jesus
[2:06:59] christ amen that's the only covering
[2:07:02] outside of that if you say keep the
[2:07:04] creed spiritual amnesia
[2:07:06] that's what happened now notice they
[2:07:09] have forgot their word
[2:07:10] they have forgot the bible they have
[2:07:12] forgot the promise they're trying to
[2:07:14] live in a glare of
[2:07:15] what methodist was what baptist was what
[2:07:17] somebody else was
[2:07:18] here's the promise of the day and god
[2:07:20] speaking through his word and confirming
[2:07:21] again proving that it is so
[2:07:23] and they still don't believe in
[2:07:25] spiritual amnesia
[2:07:27] it's exactly right total total amnesians
[2:07:31] absolutely don't believe it all a french
[2:07:34] soldier i was told a little story
[2:07:36] before we closed i didn't know it's even
[2:07:38] that late
[2:07:39] and i got about 10 pages of notes here
[2:07:41] left get it some other time notice
[2:07:44] a french soldier they got a bunch of
[2:07:46] soldiers in from the army and they had
[2:07:48] this
[2:07:48] amnesia some shock on the battle
[2:07:52] and they had a program and they they
[2:07:55] called up let people
[2:07:56] who had missing loved ones to call and
[2:07:58] see if they could identify
[2:07:59] these boys no hope for them maybe one or
[2:08:02] two out of it caught it
[2:08:04] then they took the rest of them is going
[2:08:05] to put them in a sanitarium where they'd
[2:08:06] have to stay the rest
[2:08:07] their life that's going up the hillside
[2:08:10] train pulling and
[2:08:11] stopping the station let the boys get
[2:08:13] out and stretch their legs and the
[2:08:14] guards got out on the hill to watch them
[2:08:16] because
[2:08:16] with amnesia while they they had to
[2:08:19] watch them
[2:08:19] so they watched one young fellow there
[2:08:21] he got out and began to look around that
[2:08:23] water tank
[2:08:24] looked all right over the hill he rubbed
[2:08:27] his face and
[2:08:28] he studied and he looked again and seen
[2:08:31] that water tank he looked all around the
[2:08:33] station
[2:08:34] and he started walking instead of the
[2:08:36] guard stopped and he followed him
[2:08:38] he went up over the hill down a little
[2:08:40] path turned to the right went up over
[2:08:42] another little hill
[2:08:43] and come to a little log cabin he looked
[2:08:45] coming out on the porch an old man with
[2:08:47] a
[2:08:47] cane in his hand come out and throw his
[2:08:49] arms around him said my son i know you
[2:08:51] would return
[2:08:51] they told me you were dead but i know
[2:08:53] you would return
[2:08:54] and the boy come to himself his amnesia
[2:08:58] left him he could identify who he was
[2:09:01] he know that was his father oh soldier
[2:09:04] of the cross
[2:09:06] has been shocked by so much
[2:09:09] training so many shocks of denomination
[2:09:13] and creed and things of the world
[2:09:15] why don't you just step off for a few
[2:09:17] minutes and go looking around at the
[2:09:18] bible
[2:09:19] you might wander around you might find
[2:09:20] yourself identified here in the word
[2:09:23] as a believer one of these as you might
[2:09:24] not know you may come to yourself like
[2:09:27] the prodigal son did
[2:09:28] and find yourself you might find your
[2:09:31] identification
[2:09:32] in the words of god someone said the
[2:09:35] other night long ago said but brother
[2:09:37] branham look at us pentecostal people
[2:09:39] what fine churches we got well we we got
[2:09:42] ministers has been trained
[2:09:43] listen when a man marries a wife he
[2:09:46] doesn't trust in her beauty no he trusts
[2:09:49] in the loyalty of her vow
[2:09:51] her word he doesn't trust in her beauty
[2:09:54] he trusts us in her loyalty
[2:09:56] and that's why when you marry to god you
[2:09:58] don't trust in some big beautiful church
[2:09:59] you can build
[2:10:00] but in the promise that jesus christ
[2:10:02] made on the same
[2:10:04] yesterday today and forever do you
[2:10:06] believe that
[2:10:07] let us our head just a moment
[2:10:27] amen praise the lord thank god for the
[2:10:30] word
[2:10:31] thank god for a prophet that brought the
[2:10:33] word amen
[2:10:36] not not the pastor not the evangelist
[2:10:39] but the prophet of god
[2:10:40] amen we pray the grace of god to
[2:10:44] make us in the word one amen
[2:10:48] and there's nothing that he said that i
[2:10:50] can deny it was the truth
[2:10:53] amen so i prayed and it was amazing
[2:10:56] again
[2:10:56] that though he passed through this this
[2:10:58] city there
[2:11:00] and many others and yet they they never
[2:11:03] recognized the prophet
[2:11:05] no they recognized a man with with with
[2:11:08] signs and wonders
[2:11:09] and he could he could preach this and
[2:11:11] preach that thank god for those who were
[2:11:13] behind him
[2:11:14] amen supporting this ministry but
[2:11:17] the most they were looking for was signs
[2:11:18] and wonders and again that's why he went
[2:11:21] beyond this
[2:11:22] and he went back in to pray for the sick
[2:11:25] the signs and the wonders and it's it's
[2:11:28] no wonder the prophet of god or the
[2:11:30] the lord did say and tell william
[2:11:32] branham to stop
[2:11:34] the signs and wonders all right why
[2:11:38] because they were
[2:11:39] they were just out with signs and
[2:11:41] wonders they were just at the signpost
[2:11:44] but they didn't receive in their hearts
[2:11:47] what he was preaching it's like and
[2:11:49] you'll never get
[2:11:50] you never get to where you're going
[2:11:51] unless you receive it recognize it
[2:11:54] it's like i said when we used to some
[2:11:57] years ago
[2:11:58] when our family was here in the city and
[2:12:01] there are signs of course
[2:12:02] especially during summer or holidays
[2:12:05] that they would
[2:12:07] they would that we would drive from st
[2:12:09] john's back to our
[2:12:11] town in gamble and it was
[2:12:14] absolutely absolutely amazing then i
[2:12:17] said now if coming back
[2:12:19] we're coming back home i said what are
[2:12:21] we looking at i said we're looking at
[2:12:23] the
[2:12:24] oh we're looking at the i said the signs
[2:12:27] of
[2:12:27] that's guiding us to st john's oh
[2:12:30] there's
[2:12:30] so many more back then it was miles oh
[2:12:34] oh good we're getting closer another but
[2:12:36] i said
[2:12:37] we don't stop at the sign no no we let
[2:12:40] the sign poop move us on
[2:12:42] and the closer we get the the number of
[2:12:45] miles went down
[2:12:46] we're more and more encouraged oh
[2:12:49] oh we'll soon be home amen we'll soon be
[2:12:53] home
[2:12:54] i wonder if we got that attitude
[2:12:56] spiritually
[2:12:57] amen brother there was luther was one
[2:13:01] the signs that god had all the way down
[2:13:03] through and finally of course they
[2:13:05] became allowed to see it and so on and
[2:13:08] but that was the most deceiving one
[2:13:10] and everybody say they stayed hung up by
[2:13:12] the sign
[2:13:13] allow to see it the church is rich and
[2:13:15] increased with goods have needed
[2:13:17] nothing but they had a need of something
[2:13:20] they didn't recognize
[2:13:21] or they were satisfied with the natural
[2:13:23] things of life well we
[2:13:24] and basically their their emphasis was
[2:13:27] on the natural things
[2:13:28] amen but not the spiritual and that's
[2:13:31] why jesus came and said you're richard
[2:13:32] you're miserable you're poor you're
[2:13:34] blind you're naked
[2:13:35] my what they they said oh we're rich
[2:13:40] we're increased with goods we have
[2:13:41] needed nothing we're great we're
[2:13:43] wonderful
[2:13:45] but when god looked at him through his
[2:13:46] word oh you're wretched
[2:13:49] you're miserable you're poor you're
[2:13:52] blind
[2:13:53] but they wouldn't receive it they
[2:13:54] wouldn't they didn't want that
[2:13:56] again see this as proof and evidence
[2:13:59] that as
[2:14:00] like what they what they've refused here
[2:14:02] they refuse
[2:14:04] in this last age that you and i are
[2:14:05] witnessing oh yeah
[2:14:07] they didn't want jesus to say that that
[2:14:09] you're richard miserable poor blind
[2:14:11] naked
[2:14:12] we are rich increased with goods have
[2:14:14] needed nothing
[2:14:15] yeah nothing physically but they they
[2:14:17] did have the need of something
[2:14:18] spiritually
[2:14:19] so brother what is our need don't don't
[2:14:22] don't
[2:14:22] put too much emphasis on on the natural
[2:14:24] things you'll feel that everything's
[2:14:26] fine everything's fine no let's judge
[2:14:28] ourselves by the word
[2:14:30] let's let's see if there's any needs
[2:14:32] there are we rich
[2:14:34] spiritually increased with goods
[2:14:37] comes to the revelation spiritually you
[2:14:39] know and have need of
[2:14:41] nothing by the grace of god
[2:14:44] how are you judging yourself amen the
[2:14:46] bride judges up by the word
[2:14:48] amen and jesus because jesus why she
[2:14:51] listened to jesus
[2:14:52] jesus said he said i stand at the door
[2:14:55] and knock
[2:14:56] open the open the door and i'll come
[2:14:57] into you and he said
[2:14:59] and we'll have fellowship together amen
[2:15:02] so i pray god that that's
[2:15:03] that's why we're here amen why because
[2:15:06] he knocked and
[2:15:06] he he opened the door and we went in
[2:15:08] that fellowship with him
[2:15:10] the word by the grace of god amen
[2:15:13] but the church the church is out there
[2:15:15] they're still rich and increased with
[2:15:16] goods that needed nothing
[2:15:18] and don't know that they he consider
[2:15:22] that they are wretched and miserable and
[2:15:24] poor and blind and naked
[2:15:27] uh if we were preaching that they they
[2:15:30] would
[2:15:30] they would blame us that we got the
[2:15:32] anointing of the devil
[2:15:33] they think they got the anointing of god
[2:15:36] you know
[2:15:37] and for us to be preaching that and
[2:15:38] they're just seeing that you're all
[2:15:40] all you're seeing is negative negative
[2:15:42] negative i've got a lot of complaints
[2:15:44] against my own testimony
[2:15:45] over the years that people say oh he's
[2:15:48] he's all down
[2:15:50] well you got to get down to get up you
[2:15:52] have you humble yourself
[2:15:54] to go down he'll raise you up amen by
[2:15:57] the grace of god
[2:15:58] so because i've emphasized these things
[2:16:02] the reality of what's all around us you
[2:16:05] know
[2:16:06] so and we got to recognize that
[2:16:09] you know if not we won't we won't
[2:16:11] believe what jesus said richard poor
[2:16:13] miserable blind and naked
[2:16:14] yeah so brother i'll tell you that
[2:16:16] unfortunately there's even a lot of
[2:16:18] believers
[2:16:19] with that attitude oh yeah they're blind
[2:16:22] they think they've got eyes to see and
[2:16:24] he used to hear but no they're blind
[2:16:27] and don't know it why because
[2:16:30] it's exactly what jesus prophesied
[2:16:33] he says going to get so bad and so
[2:16:36] deceitful
[2:16:37] in the last days it would deceive the
[2:16:39] very elect if possible
[2:16:42] not just to save the elect the very
[2:16:44] elect amen because there's many called
[2:16:47] but those that are chosen many are
[2:16:50] called fewer chosen as the bride of
[2:16:51] christ
[2:16:52] and he warned them that it's going to be
[2:16:54] so deceptive
[2:16:55] it would deceive them amen
[2:16:58] so god help us brother that we're not
[2:17:00] going to be deceived by those religious
[2:17:01] spirits that are on the move
[2:17:04] yeah but but by the grace of god we're
[2:17:07] going to stay
[2:17:08] with the word and the prophet again
[2:17:12] in that message
[2:17:17] on spiritual amnesia
[2:17:20] he goes on i don't want to be honest
[2:17:23] we heard it but he goes on to to give us
[2:17:26] the exhortation
[2:17:27] to stay with the word amen
[2:17:30] don't go with this don't go with that
[2:17:32] stay with the word
[2:17:34] and that's why it's going to get down to
[2:17:35] the twos and trees
[2:17:38] he said amen so grace of god to us
[2:17:41] brother sister
[2:17:42] amen and again
[2:17:48] i would have i really wanted to go
[2:17:51] through in some of those things there
[2:17:53] and uh but i felt that if i
[2:17:58] played the tape that i wouldn't have to
[2:18:00] take two or three services to go through
[2:18:01] the quotes
[2:18:02] and it would you know to bring it into
[2:18:05] the word
[2:18:06] so just bear with me just uh
[2:18:11] okay
[2:18:15] so i pray god to make you and what you
[2:18:18] heard one
[2:18:19] i pray by the grace of god that what you
[2:18:22] hear is going to control
[2:18:24] what you do what you don't do amen
[2:18:27] you're going to you're going to humble
[2:18:28] yourself and come back in order
[2:18:30] make sure you're in order with the word
[2:18:32] amen
[2:18:33] by the grace of god
[2:18:37] he said i i like this part that he was
[2:18:39] bringing out near the end there
[2:18:41] he said i was most surely with
[2:18:44] jesus at calvary
[2:18:50] amen
[2:18:52] i must be identified with him at calvary
[2:18:55] i must be there to a place that
[2:18:57] we're not where not also was i
[2:19:00] identified with him at calvary
[2:19:02] i died with him at calvary
[2:19:05] i trust the lives we live is proof
[2:19:09] that we die we lay down our lives with
[2:19:11] him and we rose up in the resurrection
[2:19:14] and we're living resurrected raptured
[2:19:17] lives again that's right you
[2:19:20] at the quickened you as he resurrected
[2:19:23] who were dead
[2:19:24] in sins and trespasses amen because we
[2:19:27] lay ourselves down with him
[2:19:29] amen praise the lord and again
[2:19:32] like i said we've been raptured into
[2:19:34] heavenly places oh
[2:19:36] and that's why we are totally separated
[2:19:38] from the world
[2:19:39] because we're where the word is being
[2:19:41] revealed that's it that's in
[2:19:44] in the rapture in christ amen
[2:19:48] i died with him at calvary
[2:19:53] i don't think it meant where most
[2:19:54] believers and so-called christians today
[2:19:57] really they don't consider what jesus
[2:20:00] suffered
[2:20:02] for them they're already considered what
[2:20:05] jesus did
[2:20:06] endure for your sake to save you
[2:20:09] so brother sister what what are we
[2:20:12] willing to suffer as
[2:20:14] do for him not to save him
[2:20:18] amen but to show what he did
[2:20:22] we needed and we appreciate it
[2:20:25] because lord we're going to lay our
[2:20:27] lives down for you
[2:20:29] you laid yours down for me now lord help
[2:20:31] me to lay my life down for you
[2:20:33] through whatever i'm getting involved
[2:20:35] with here and there and there no no
[2:20:37] lord i just stay down
[2:20:40] amen we'll get put down by the world
[2:20:44] but that's fine they did as i said dude
[2:20:48] oh yeah i see the word of god there i
[2:20:49] preached on being a prisoner
[2:20:51] not a prisoner i said of newfoundland
[2:20:53] not a prisoner of of
[2:20:54] of canada not a prisoner there a
[2:20:56] prisoner there no you're
[2:20:58] you become a prisoner of jesus
[2:21:01] amen totally controlled by jesus amen
[2:21:04] and the gospel so god help us
[2:21:09] so he said again now i
[2:21:12] am seated with him in heavenly places in
[2:21:15] christ jesus
[2:21:16] with all the powers of hell conquered
[2:21:18] through him
[2:21:19] amen now he said i find myself in this
[2:21:23] last days
[2:21:24] with the many believing christians
[2:21:27] identified in his ministry
[2:21:29] he is the same yesterday today and
[2:21:31] forever
[2:21:32] i find myself in this day identified in
[2:21:34] his ministry
[2:21:36] do you find yourself that way believing
[2:21:40] walking with it amen he said the
[2:21:43] believer would do the same thing
[2:21:45] and the works that i shall do you shall
[2:21:47] do also
[2:21:48] amen i was with him at the day of
[2:21:51] pentecost
[2:21:52] i was with the disciples up there
[2:21:55] identified with them in the baptism
[2:21:57] of the holy ghost amen
[2:22:00] i wonder if the church hasn't got
[2:22:02] amnesia
[2:22:04] so much now that they don't no don't
[2:22:06] some of them
[2:22:07] don't even believe there is such a thing
[2:22:09] as the holy ghost
[2:22:11] there's very little emphasis put on the
[2:22:13] baptism of the holy ghost or even around
[2:22:15] the message
[2:22:16] they're putting the answers on on this
[2:22:18] doctrine this doctrine that doctrine
[2:22:20] oh yeah but no what about your personal
[2:22:23] relationship with jesus
[2:22:26] amen doesn't make a difference where it
[2:22:29] was
[2:22:30] all down through the ages they all had a
[2:22:32] personal relationship
[2:22:33] with the lord they were born again
[2:22:37] amen so i pray grace that we have the
[2:22:40] testimony that we're born
[2:22:42] again you didn't we didn't just come out
[2:22:44] of one church into another
[2:22:46] no no we were born again
[2:22:50] amen and god brought us brought us out
[2:22:53] of that hospital
[2:22:56] that you were in amen you don't have to
[2:22:58] go back there no more
[2:22:59] amen he brought you to the word and
[2:23:01] you're born again
[2:23:03] and you'll feed on the word you get more
[2:23:04] and more and more faith
[2:23:06] amen luther did wesley did the
[2:23:08] pentecostals now the bride
[2:23:10] but look what they they did the lutheran
[2:23:13] brought forth the work of the of the
[2:23:14] word the revealed word
[2:23:16] they brought forth the life of the
[2:23:17] revealed word the life of the revealed
[2:23:18] word
[2:23:19] and now what are we going to bring forth
[2:23:22] resurrection and rapture by the grace of
[2:23:26] god
[2:23:26] god help us amen
[2:23:30] he said now i am seated with him in
[2:23:32] heavenly places in christ
[2:23:35] with all the powers of hell conquered
[2:23:38] through him amen praise the lord
[2:23:41] don't let the devil get the victory in
[2:23:43] your life don't let the devil decide
[2:23:45] deceive you
[2:23:47] don't let the devil trick you into doing
[2:23:48] this doing that
[2:23:50] god help us amen well again
[2:23:53] he tricked he tricked cain yeah
[2:23:57] and cain thought for sure he said you
[2:23:59] know i got my
[2:24:00] church i got i got my offering got my
[2:24:02] altar got my sacrifices
[2:24:04] all wonderful you know and maybe kane
[2:24:07] thought he
[2:24:07] is was the best better than abel's
[2:24:11] he's right because he because they were
[2:24:13] like i said he would never had nothing
[2:24:14] only of
[2:24:15] only a slain lamb blood all over the
[2:24:18] altar blood over over abel
[2:24:20] and no doubt abel was giving him a
[2:24:22] preaching to him a revelation
[2:24:24] oh yeah it was by it was by faith that
[2:24:27] abel
[2:24:28] offered the more excellent sacrifice it
[2:24:30] was revealed to him
[2:24:31] and he was sharing that revelation that
[2:24:33] faith with cain
[2:24:34] and cain killed him right why
[2:24:37] because he was downloading cain's
[2:24:40] sacrifice
[2:24:41] he was downloading same kings altar
[2:24:44] maybe showing that well
[2:24:46] look what you've done look look what
[2:24:47] i've done abel my
[2:24:49] surely the lord appreciates this yeah
[2:24:52] but it wasn't by faith
[2:24:55] no no but what what abel did was by
[2:24:58] faith
[2:24:59] and he pleased god amen
[2:25:02] so brother what we do has to be based on
[2:25:06] faith
[2:25:08] not religious ideas of doctrine
[2:25:11] no no religious because you feel
[2:25:13] religious to do this to do this
[2:25:15] yeah lord we want to do this for you and
[2:25:17] so on no
[2:25:18] no you got to do what god wants you to
[2:25:20] do amen
[2:25:22] we got to have the faith that pleases
[2:25:24] god see that again
[2:25:25] cain cain never read the faith that
[2:25:27] pleased god
[2:25:29] and god told him god said cain if you do
[2:25:32] if you do do right he said won't you
[2:25:34] also be accepted
[2:25:36] yeah he would but no way he felt that
[2:25:40] god should accept what he was doing and
[2:25:41] what he did
[2:25:43] and there's a lot of believers saying
[2:25:44] god should accept what we've done and
[2:25:46] what we're doing you know we're doing
[2:25:47] this we're doing that
[2:25:49] well regardless of what you do
[2:25:52] your salvation is in jesus name
[2:25:55] not doing this not doing this doing that
[2:25:57] no no definitely not
[2:25:59] no your salvation was in the finished
[2:26:01] work of calvary
[2:26:02] it was in christ it all goes back to him
[2:26:05] starts with
[2:26:06] him amen and when what we do after that
[2:26:09] well
[2:26:10] if it's according to his will god help
[2:26:13] us
[2:26:14] again there's there was a message that i
[2:26:17] wanted to bring up too
[2:26:18] and that was on trying to do goddess
[2:26:20] service without
[2:26:21] his will amen
[2:26:24] that's what cain was trying to do amen
[2:26:27] but it didn't work
[2:26:28] mccain but abel had the will of god
[2:26:31] i pray grace that we have the will of
[2:26:33] god doing what we're doing part of the
[2:26:35] emphasis on the word lining up with the
[2:26:37] word
[2:26:37] by the grace of god amen humbling
[2:26:40] ourselves to acknowledge lord
[2:26:42] thank you i acknowledge lord that we are
[2:26:44] sinners
[2:26:45] saved by grace yeah
[2:26:48] you can't condemn this one or that one
[2:26:50] no because
[2:26:52] oh yeah they're this they're this forget
[2:26:54] it
[2:26:55] that what you're seeing in that person
[2:26:57] i'll remind you what god sees in you
[2:27:00] amen oh that person you know he's not a
[2:27:03] believer he's not this he's oh he's a
[2:27:05] he's a sinner well well you're a sinner
[2:27:09] saved by grace amen and you're still in
[2:27:12] this
[2:27:12] old sinful body and god is with you to
[2:27:15] give you power and great grace to
[2:27:17] overcome
[2:27:18] amen so humble yourself better stay
[2:27:21] humble
[2:27:22] and as i said don't look down your nose
[2:27:24] at anybody if there's another another
[2:27:26] believer or somebody out there in the
[2:27:28] nomination don't look down your nose
[2:27:30] at them definitely not and remember as i
[2:27:33] said i preached this
[2:27:34] 55 years ago almost my first sermon and
[2:27:38] i give them the scripture and i said so
[2:27:40] i said keep your attitude right in your
[2:27:41] spirit right
[2:27:42] i said don't look down your nose at that
[2:27:44] one i said
[2:27:46] maybe they'll get in and you won't yeah
[2:27:49] they'll be they'll be cast out so i pray
[2:27:52] the grace of god brother alphas
[2:27:54] to keep our spirit and our attitude
[2:27:56] right that god is in control
[2:28:00] by the grace of god and again when our
[2:28:03] prophet was taken off the scene
[2:28:05] in 1965 and like i said i have
[2:28:08] i have a copy of the newspaper that they
[2:28:12] published back then and and uh they
[2:28:14] interviewed
[2:28:15] different religions as it were religious
[2:28:18] people to
[2:28:19] you know see what they thought about
[2:28:20] william branham and
[2:28:22] and they're gone well most of them just
[2:28:24] felt so bad
[2:28:26] you know and but it was a roman catholic
[2:28:30] priest he was in some roman catholic
[2:28:32] office in the church
[2:28:34] and they interviewed him and he he was
[2:28:36] he was so
[2:28:38] disappointed so all mine down because
[2:28:41] william branham was gone
[2:28:44] and why why because he
[2:28:47] what did he experience what did he find
[2:28:49] in william branham
[2:28:51] the love of god
[2:28:55] and he said well when it comes to
[2:28:56] william branham he said
[2:28:58] there's one thing for sure when you met
[2:29:01] him
[2:29:01] and you talked to him he said you knew
[2:29:03] he loved you
[2:29:06] amen today you talk to
[2:29:10] many believers and you don't sense no
[2:29:13] love
[2:29:14] no but i tell you if they're born again
[2:29:17] seed of god the bride of christ
[2:29:20] they'll have that love as god loved them
[2:29:23] they will love you yes god laid himself
[2:29:27] down for
[2:29:27] you they will lay down sit there lay
[2:29:30] themselves down for one another
[2:29:32] oh yeah by the grace of god but there's
[2:29:34] not many living that kind of life today
[2:29:36] most are just living for themselves but
[2:29:38] not for the body
[2:29:41] but the true believers are living for
[2:29:43] the body of christ
[2:29:45] amen as he's talking about here he said
[2:29:47] i was with daniel i was with the hebrew
[2:29:50] children i was with david yes that's
[2:29:51] right
[2:29:52] well we're all in different in a
[2:29:54] theophany body
[2:29:56] but we're all back there with moses with
[2:29:58] jacob
[2:29:59] joseph and so on yeah by the grace of
[2:30:02] god
[2:30:04] amen he said i was with him on the day
[2:30:06] of pentecost
[2:30:08] just think i was with him on calvary i
[2:30:10] wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia
[2:30:12] so much
[2:30:13] now that they don't some of them don't
[2:30:15] even believe
[2:30:16] there is such a thing as the holy ghost
[2:30:20] so where the church has gone a very bad
[2:30:24] case of amnesia
[2:30:26] they have forgotten he said that that
[2:30:29] was jesus christ back there
[2:30:31] they have forgotten he was just
[2:30:36] or rather what jesus christ was
[2:30:40] they have forgotten because they thought
[2:30:42] he was a lawmaker
[2:30:44] or a prophet or a good man they forgot
[2:30:47] that he was god
[2:30:48] they forgot that he is the same
[2:30:50] yesterday today and forever
[2:30:52] and the church has got a bad case of
[2:30:54] spiritual amnesia
[2:30:56] and unfortunately again i'm experiencing
[2:30:58] where a lot of believers
[2:30:59] have got a bad case of amnesia spiritual
[2:31:02] amnesia
[2:31:03] because that anointing is not there that
[2:31:05] used to be there
[2:31:06] years ago no and again this and again
[2:31:09] that's the proof
[2:31:10] where jesus said concerning the elect
[2:31:13] that is so deceiving that
[2:31:14] it would deceive the very elective
[2:31:16] possible
[2:31:18] yeah well it must that must be the hour
[2:31:21] that we're living because
[2:31:22] personally from somebody that knew this
[2:31:24] and knew that back 50 years ago
[2:31:26] and the anointing 50 years ago and oh my
[2:31:29] the attitudes
[2:31:30] and and and to realize now that it's
[2:31:34] it's almost all gone so like he said
[2:31:38] most are being deceived
[2:31:40] yeah it's that bad
[2:31:44] he said don't get spiritual amnesia
[2:31:48] because you will you you'll identify
[2:31:51] yourself with something else
[2:31:53] stay right with that word
[2:31:57] amen it's not identifying with the
[2:32:00] preacher it's not identifying what is
[2:32:02] this ministry that ministry
[2:32:03] is identifying with jesus amen
[2:32:08] he said you say i don't believe that the
[2:32:10] sick are healed
[2:32:11] you've got spiritual amnesia
[2:32:15] brother because he's the same yesterday
[2:32:17] today and forever
[2:32:22] bear with me a moment here
[2:32:26] he said that's what's matter with the
[2:32:27] church today he said that's what's
[2:32:30] matter
[2:32:31] we can't have revival today and that's
[2:32:33] what's the matter with the people today
[2:32:35] they've been sold drug
[2:32:39] over coals
[2:32:42] or everything and every ism that could
[2:32:44] hatch it up
[2:32:45] he said till they don't know what is
[2:32:47] right or wrong
[2:32:48] amen and she can't remember her lord she
[2:32:51] can't remember his word
[2:32:53] she can't remember the promise of god
[2:32:56] amen it's a spiritual amnesia
[2:33:01] as i've been ministered on or said that
[2:33:04] in the three kinds of believers brother
[2:33:06] brown said i'm preaching it he said this
[2:33:08] this way and he said i want you to
[2:33:14] just want you to say this is me
[2:33:17] i'm not a i'm not a make-believer i'm
[2:33:18] not a non-believer i'm a believer
[2:33:20] so he preached it and preached it and he
[2:33:22] said he said but what are you
[2:33:24] no doubt there was others there felt
[2:33:25] maybe he shouldn't have been preaching
[2:33:26] that
[2:33:27] and maybe he discerned that well he said
[2:33:29] i'm preaching it i landed out
[2:33:31] so that you'll you'll be able to
[2:33:33] determine which is you
[2:33:35] amen so he wanted to let he let him know
[2:33:37] what a believer was he let him know what
[2:33:39] a
[2:33:40] unbeliever was and a make-believer and
[2:33:41] the attitude they would have
[2:33:43] now he said which one are you not just
[2:33:46] hear it and learn it is to apply it to
[2:33:48] your own life
[2:33:50] and say oh well i i heard the message
[2:33:53] and
[2:33:54] i've talked to the lord about it and i
[2:33:57] felt maybe i was an unbeliever in
[2:33:59] certain areas of my life
[2:34:00] not only and i was a make-believer in
[2:34:03] other areas of my life
[2:34:04] and things that i was doing and but i i
[2:34:07] settled it with the lord
[2:34:08] and i'm a believer amen
[2:34:11] so also with with with the message
[2:34:13] concerning
[2:34:15] spiritual amnesia amen brother we want
[2:34:19] you to consider
[2:34:20] do i have amnesia spiritual amnesia
[2:34:24] have i forgotten am i forgetting you
[2:34:27] know this
[2:34:27] and this and this that what god requires
[2:34:30] now
[2:34:31] oh that was just then well what about
[2:34:33] now
[2:34:34] brother let's create grace that we don't
[2:34:36] get spiritual amnesia and forget it
[2:34:39] because they they were back in the
[2:34:41] beginning when they walked
[2:34:42] walk walk in this word walk with this
[2:34:45] word
[2:34:46] oh my oh my praise the lord what what an
[2:34:49] attitude of spirit that the people had
[2:34:51] what an anointing was on them and yeah
[2:34:54] that like that catholic priest said i
[2:34:56] shook the handle with him brought him i
[2:34:58] knew he loved me
[2:34:59] yeah and yeah well
[2:35:03] believers experience those things too
[2:35:05] with believers
[2:35:06] but it's not not now like it was back
[2:35:08] then
[2:35:09] no god help us
[2:35:15] and he said i like a pedigreed
[2:35:19] christian that can go all the way back
[2:35:22] to the word of god
[2:35:23] to the day of pentecost and identify
[2:35:25] themselves with the saints
[2:35:28] where the power of the holy ghost came
[2:35:29] upon them that's
[2:35:31] a pedigreed christian and he knows where
[2:35:34] he come from
[2:35:35] he's not identified with methodist
[2:35:37] baptists
[2:35:38] or nothing else is identified with god's
[2:35:41] word
[2:35:42] and knows exactly where he is standing
[2:35:44] the royal
[2:35:45] blood of his father flows through him
[2:35:48] the blood of jesus christ
[2:35:50] amen the church today has got a bad
[2:35:54] case of spiritual amnesia and
[2:35:57] don't just take it and apply it out
[2:36:00] there
[2:36:01] let's take it and apply it in our own
[2:36:03] ranks
[2:36:04] and in your own life too often the
[2:36:07] people take
[2:36:08] just certain messages and they just
[2:36:10] apply it out there but they won't apply
[2:36:12] it among themselves
[2:36:14] and that's what's wrong amen
[2:36:18] again he told you to make your calling
[2:36:20] election sure
[2:36:21] make sure you're going to apply it here
[2:36:24] not out there
[2:36:26] what what god with the word of god oh
[2:36:28] well i'm separated i don't have nothing
[2:36:29] to do with him
[2:36:31] well maybe god don't have nothing to do
[2:36:32] with you
[2:36:34] god help us amen
[2:36:39] so he said the church today as a bad
[2:36:43] case of spiritual amnesia
[2:36:44] what made us rich so what made us so
[2:36:47] rich
[2:36:48] as we are it has got to the place of
[2:36:51] laodicea
[2:36:52] back into that rich place like israel
[2:36:55] was
[2:36:56] and when it was poor it had to trust god
[2:36:59] for everything
[2:37:00] it could do amen and brother i said
[2:37:04] the prophet of god warned us that
[2:37:07] it's coming to a day when uh we're going
[2:37:09] i'll say you go to bed tonight you got
[2:37:11] money in the bank
[2:37:12] i said you wake up tomorrow and i said
[2:37:14] you you don't own it
[2:37:16] i said there's another power that's
[2:37:18] going to take control of it
[2:37:20] what are we going to do then are we
[2:37:22] going to
[2:37:24] oh are we going to forsake what
[2:37:28] what we really believe why are we going
[2:37:29] to keep taking our stand for the word
[2:37:32] or will we compromise just to keep get
[2:37:34] our money back
[2:37:36] i tell you there's a lot of believers
[2:37:37] are going to compromise
[2:37:39] when they realize what they're going to
[2:37:41] lose when it comes to the natural things
[2:37:42] of this world
[2:37:43] natural things of life they'll
[2:37:45] compromise just to get it back normal
[2:37:47] say
[2:37:47] that's mine that's mine that's mine
[2:37:49] thank you
[2:37:53] no wonder he said when he come will he
[2:37:54] find faith
[2:37:56] on the earth they're down through the
[2:37:59] ages there were those that were that had
[2:38:00] faith
[2:38:01] to the extent that they would lay down
[2:38:04] their lives
[2:38:06] yeah as paul laid down his god help us
[2:38:12] amen that god elvis and gave us the
[2:38:14] faith
[2:38:15] that stays with the word and we're not
[2:38:17] going to compromise for
[2:38:18] family friends or neighbors
[2:38:22] we're not going to compromise for
[2:38:23] ourselves
[2:38:25] amen many will unfortunately
[2:38:30] we know that that's the truth or jesus
[2:38:33] wouldn't have warned us
[2:38:35] in the way that he did
[2:38:40] amen
[2:38:42] god's grace to us
[2:38:47] i want to ask you something
[2:38:50] what if he does come tonight
[2:38:54] oh say he isn't coming i don't know
[2:38:56] whether he is or not
[2:38:58] this is the last sign
[2:39:01] remember thus saith the lord did you
[2:39:04] ever hear me
[2:39:05] say that but what it was true
[2:39:08] he said you are seeing your last sign
[2:39:11] that scriptural he said you've seen your
[2:39:14] last sign
[2:39:16] pentecost don't get mixed up now
[2:39:19] with what he promised israel after the
[2:39:22] rapture
[2:39:23] that ain't you he said you're done
[2:39:26] now is your day now is your sign
[2:39:29] now is your time don't reject it don't
[2:39:32] do it
[2:39:33] you'd better come believe me to be god's
[2:39:36] servant he said
[2:39:40] he said you are the nicest people i want
[2:39:42] to meet in my life
[2:39:43] here in birmingham but you need a
[2:39:45] revival
[2:39:47] you are dying and you're taking
[2:39:49] spiritual amnesia
[2:39:50] you are dying and he said don't do that
[2:39:54] revive that what you've got bring it up
[2:39:57] again
[2:39:57] quickly before jesus comes
[2:40:03] and get rid of that amnesia and now
[2:40:06] how many knows that i am telling you the
[2:40:08] truth that you are dying
[2:40:10] and need a revival but folks
[2:40:14] you better wake up right quick
[2:40:17] and he said right here brother brown
[2:40:19] pound the pulpit three times
[2:40:24] and he said in that hour that you think
[2:40:26] not it might happen
[2:40:28] amen so remember he said you're getting
[2:40:30] your last
[2:40:31] warning so he said flee while you have
[2:40:35] time to flee
[2:40:36] amen wake up while you have time to wake
[2:40:39] up
[2:40:40] make your calling election sure when you
[2:40:41] have time to do it by the grace of god
[2:40:45] but it's unfortunate but we're living in
[2:40:47] that hour
[2:40:50] wherein that is written in the bible
[2:40:52] there's somewhere concerning those that
[2:40:55] look into the mirror of the word of god
[2:40:59] amen and some look into it and see
[2:41:03] see themselves and they want to they
[2:41:05] want to change
[2:41:07] and others look in and they see their
[2:41:08] faults and everything else and just move
[2:41:10] on
[2:41:11] amen they're not taking the
[2:41:15] mirror of the word of god seriously
[2:41:18] so lord help us bear with me just try to
[2:41:21] find that scripture
[2:41:28] amen
[2:41:33] oh sorry
[2:41:42] let's see
[2:41:47] he said but ye are doers of the word and
[2:41:50] not errors only
[2:41:52] there are some that hear it but not do
[2:41:53] it he said deceiving
[2:41:58] or he said be ye doers of the word and
[2:42:00] not errors only
[2:42:01] there are those that hear the word only
[2:42:03] but not do it well i just believe in god
[2:42:06] no you gotta line up your word with it
[2:42:09] line up your life with it every day
[2:42:13] what how you do this how you do that and
[2:42:16] how you react in this how you react in
[2:42:18] that
[2:42:19] that's what you're doing because the
[2:42:20] anointing is in you the holy ghost is in
[2:42:22] you
[2:42:23] make sure that you're going to say and
[2:42:25] talk the way you you should talk
[2:42:27] as a christian and act the way you
[2:42:28] should be acting as a christian
[2:42:30] and reacting as a christian and so on so
[2:42:33] that it's not it's not you that lives
[2:42:34] it's christ that lives in you
[2:42:36] by the grace of god so he said
[2:42:40] be ye doers of the word and not errors
[2:42:43] only
[2:42:44] he said if you're just doing the word
[2:42:47] not doing the word and just hearing it
[2:42:49] he said you're deceiving your own self
[2:42:52] amen if any man if any be a hearer of
[2:42:55] the word and not a doer
[2:42:57] he is like unto a man beholding his
[2:43:00] natural face in a glass
[2:43:02] for he be all of himself and go with his
[2:43:05] way
[2:43:05] and straightway forgetteth what manner
[2:43:08] of man he
[2:43:09] was amen but there are others that look
[2:43:13] into it
[2:43:14] and take it serious and if there's
[2:43:16] anything they need to get done
[2:43:17] they go get it done but others just look
[2:43:20] into the mirror and go on
[2:43:23] they don't stop to consider what they
[2:43:24] need to do
[2:43:27] amen
[2:43:30] it says why also looketh into the
[2:43:32] perfect law of liberty
[2:43:34] and continue it therein he be not a
[2:43:37] forgetful error
[2:43:38] but a doer of the work this man shall be
[2:43:41] blessed
[2:43:42] in his deed so god help us look into the
[2:43:45] mirror
[2:43:46] and act and react according to what
[2:43:48] we're seeing
[2:43:49] by the grace of god
[2:43:54] amen
[2:43:58] he said you're not going to get anything
[2:44:00] from god till
[2:44:01] you get desperate
[2:44:05] and you gotta get desperate enough so
[2:44:08] god recognizes your desperation
[2:44:10] amen he said what a place to be in
[2:44:15] there's no fire burning there's no
[2:44:16] enthusiasm
[2:44:18] there's not a go into it and he said as
[2:44:21] an evangelist that just kills me
[2:44:23] to see god's people in that shape
[2:44:26] we're supposed to be on fire
[2:44:30] amen but he said see you see
[2:44:33] is exactly what i told you revelation 3
[2:44:37] your lukewarm and he said because you're
[2:44:39] lukewarm
[2:44:40] then i'm going to spew you out of my
[2:44:43] mouth
[2:44:44] amen pray god don't spit you out
[2:44:48] amen but you're there ready for him to
[2:44:51] use you in any way he wants to
[2:44:53] by the grace of god amen so god bless us
[2:44:57] amen as we continue
[2:45:01] in the word amen seriously
[2:45:04] amen by the grace of god serious
[2:45:10] brother how serious are we to be
[2:45:14] concerning the resurrection and the
[2:45:16] rapture
[2:45:17] we ought to be very serious because
[2:45:20] if if we're living in that hour right
[2:45:22] now of the resurrection rapture
[2:45:25] we we ought to be looking on oh yeah and
[2:45:28] i think that's what god's looking for in
[2:45:29] us
[2:45:30] spiritually in our experience with god
[2:45:32] are we really really looking up
[2:45:35] for the rapture looking up for the
[2:45:37] change looking up to get out of here out
[2:45:38] of here and into glory
[2:45:40] and they really believe us believe
[2:45:42] rather that there is
[2:45:44] there is another place where jesus is
[2:45:47] waiting for us
[2:45:49] in glory amen
[2:45:52] in heaven god help us
[2:45:56] we heard a sermon
[2:46:02] there was a sermon this morning on the
[2:46:03] radio that we just tuned in for
[2:46:05] something
[2:46:06] and uh pentecostal pastor
[2:46:10] preaching from the church that i would
[2:46:12] that i that i was in many many years ago
[2:46:15] and i have to i have to be honest i said
[2:46:17] yeah he's spiritual
[2:46:19] he's really putting the people on their
[2:46:21] guard and on their toes
[2:46:23] concerning their relationship with the
[2:46:25] lord
[2:46:26] amen so you just don't don't take it for
[2:46:29] granted
[2:46:29] you just don't assume everything is all
[2:46:31] right well i go to church i'm a
[2:46:32] christian
[2:46:32] oh yeah i'm going to a pentecostal
[2:46:34] church yeah
[2:46:36] the devil does too and the devil goes to
[2:46:40] messy churches
[2:46:41] yeah so god help us brother because i
[2:46:44] must i gotta say that the
[2:46:45] the preacher he was really balanced in
[2:46:47] what he was preaching
[2:46:49] and challenging the people in their
[2:46:51] relationship with jesus
[2:46:54] it was a challenge amen
[2:46:57] brother believers need to be challenged
[2:47:00] only those that have a perfect
[2:47:01] relationship with jesus is going into
[2:47:03] resurrection and rapture
[2:47:05] god help us amen
[2:47:10] he said the only way that you can
[2:47:12] actually be a christian
[2:47:14] is for christ to identify himself
[2:47:18] in you amen
[2:47:22] he said we got a stinger there
[2:47:25] amen it is christ identified
[2:47:28] in you and that's when he has recognized
[2:47:32] you praise the lord amen
[2:47:36] so do others recognize you as a
[2:47:38] christian because they're seeing christ
[2:47:40] living in your life christ in your
[2:47:42] spirit your attitude your conversations
[2:47:45] your
[2:47:45] decisions and everything oh they're
[2:47:48] christians
[2:47:49] yeah i trust that they they see that in
[2:47:52] you
[2:47:53] those that you work for those that you
[2:47:54] associate with fellowship with
[2:47:56] and so on grace of god
[2:48:00] so again it's christ identified in you
[2:48:03] and that's when he has recognized
[2:48:05] you but when christ is identified in you
[2:48:09] and he said identifying himself then you
[2:48:11] are christ-like
[2:48:12] he said which the word christian
[2:48:16] means to be christ-like he said there is
[2:48:18] your identification
[2:48:20] amen identified with him by living for
[2:48:23] him
[2:48:24] amen so i trust that you're living for
[2:48:27] jesus
[2:48:29] there's another quote satisfying we'll
[2:48:32] leave it there
[2:48:33] and it's like i said when i was in a
[2:48:36] certain
[2:48:39] building a certain store to
[2:48:43] buy some things there or to check some
[2:48:45] things i don't know what it was now
[2:48:47] but i noticed the worker
[2:48:50] and it's a young man and
[2:48:54] he walked by and he had his name on his
[2:48:57] tag there
[2:48:58] and he said christian
[2:49:02] oh so i ran after him
[2:49:06] and i said excuse me i said your name is
[2:49:09] christian
[2:49:10] yes he said that's my name oh i said
[2:49:13] well god bless you
[2:49:14] and i said thank you i said i said most
[2:49:18] would narrow it down to chris not
[2:49:21] christian but chris
[2:49:23] so i said i prayed the lord i said help
[2:49:25] you to keep it
[2:49:26] he said that way i said i said it is to
[2:49:29] be christ-like
[2:49:30] oh well he was i think he was a
[2:49:32] professing christian oh i said good the
[2:49:34] lord bless you
[2:49:35] i said keep it up and i said don't
[2:49:37] narrow your name down
[2:49:38] i said keep it the same okay said thank
[2:49:41] you
[2:49:42] so he wasn't offended but i i appreciate
