name of Jesus Lord that were there not not just with the human spirit not just Lord with the our feelings My Lord with the Holy Ghost praying that all the ghosts Lord is in control the Holy Ghost in

you're in control Lord Alleluia what we believe a man so we pray the grace of God Lord and the anointing of the Holy Ghost to be in control father through this service yes Lord here again and again those on line for your glory your honor your praise to God be the glory because great things Lord you have done and great things you're doing so be with us we pray as we commit ourselves into your care for your glory your honor your praise and for our redemption in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen now I believe all things are possible now me no I believe no Oh Ranger possible [Music] a man praise the Lord a man the Lord blushes here and again those on line and we pray the grace of God to be with us a man ministered to us here but also ministered to those on line of course and i feel as i heard a brother express one of the brethren online are on the internet rather that there was looking forward to everything changing so that the he wouldn't be preaching just to just to a few in any in the audience but he'd be preaching to all of them a man that they would come back to church again and now me that that he felt to that many a believer that was viewing it online and at home was longing for that time to get back to church any man so we pray the grace of god brother to to bring to bring it to pass we know you know this may be just a just a beginning of other things that we expect to come upon them upon the earth because we know things are going to change but we pray grace that our faith doesn't change just that it will get better and stronger amen and our faith by the grace of god to increase a man to it to our staying for the word of god so god bless us and may the lord help us during this time it's it's a trial especially for those at home it's a trial for the for the ministry to come and minister and again ministering to theophanies not ministering to the physical bodies but to theophanies but as i was thinking about that today and this thought also struck me and says son that's what i'm longing for i've been ministering to theophanies but the lord was saying son i'm longing to get together you all in a glorified body a man so you're looking for those to come back to the church in a physical condition and he said I'm looking for all the things to come back in a glorified body a man because he's been what I've been ministering to as it worked with the often Eason and so on that's what God's been ministering to a man but he's what is longing for that hour that moment to come for the change when we're gonna come home in glorified bodies oh this is wonderful a man and again God allowing these things to happen maybe to bring that that revelation to our hearts a man to make it more real to us for the glory of God Oh Lord we're looking forward to it to a man we're looking forward not just to get out of the flesh and into a theophany we're looking forward to get out of this and he doing a glorified body by the grace of God probably gods that were going to go from ear to theophany and into a glorified body by the grace of God so God's grace be with us and I pray that we're not going to lose that faith but brother that faith is going to keep us moving that faith is going to keep us looking up by the grace of God amen so grace that we're going to have the revelation the faith that pleases God the faith that will bring us to that Dourif I'd body a man praise the Lord so Lord bless us turn with me to the book of Proverbs chapter one and there was another message that I was thinking about maybe ministering on but we'll leave that until Sunday the Lord willing and by the grace of God and I think we've been notified that there'd be no service next way to sleep because we lab service with our brother Ben Friday Saturday and Sunday that's where brother Joseph started out that's where we ended up a man Friday Saturday and Sunday and so being prayer for our brother Ben a man and as I don't know whether it was ministry in his home or in a church or where and again I feel that most of the ministry and brethren would prefer to be standing me behind a pulpit and minister that way rather than sitting in their homes or even or even in an office and so on so we pray the grace of God be with our brother Ben a man as he would come come to minister to us amen and also to be in prayer I may be mentioned it I think in the last service but greetings from our brother Eber in st. Lawrence as I said he called but we didn't get his call he got a message he left a message on the phone to greet us all and to thank us all to say that he's doing good and the Lord and the Lord has blessed him Amen that's good praise the name of the Lord so let's be in prayer one for another and keep also our brother Eber in prayer for the glory of God amen and in proverbs chapter 1 and share with you some thoughts tonight concerning a message that the prophet of God again priest in 1965 and it's one of the last messages that the Prophet preached and not the last message but one of the last ones before is homegoing and he makes reference to it even in this message right here concerning his own home going that may be that he was going to go and maybe the Lord was going to take him off the off the scene and so on and that's exactly what the Lord did he preached this message in August and the 15th 1965 and it was in December that the Lord called him home Amen brother and I felt that brother Brown in well after the oume the seals brother realm may be felt that he could could be going home amen he preached just not very many more messages and he said now he says that's another revelation on the seals and one of them was marriage in divorce and so on but he said another revelation on the seals and I believe there was other messages as well but it was it was the opening of the word he preached the seven seals and then after that he preached this this and this and this but it was further unveiling of the mystery of God a man and the finally brother we could we come to the hour when it's over and is finished and we know in December 1963 brother Bentham said ere I go he said back into evangelism amen because he felt that the other ministry was was over with was finished or that that God was was finished with it amen so he would go back into evangelism and wait on the Lord and that's what he did and he did come back of course to Benham tabernacle and maybe even in brother Jack Morris Church he would preach certain messages to believers a man that the Lord would lay on his heart on to the Lord called him home a man so I believe that whatever the Lord wanted the prophet of God to preach after the open the seals I believe that he had it done finished a man by the time the Lord called him home when we consider that the last message he preached was communion a man and I don't think that was that was by chance or and it wasn't a message he just greeted the people in Tucson Tabernacle in brother Greene's assembly brother green preached but brother branham he asked whether round get up and greet the people any any and he did explain to them concerning the communion a man then as I said before I can't see how that believers can say we shouldn't take communion when that was the last message that we have hearing brother Branham explained our need to take communion so god help us brother so again tonight the message that I want to share with you tonight and some of the thoughts in it not all the message for sure but some of the thoughts and I have ministered on this before and it may be quite some time ago but and it's a message and knoweth it not a man what a subject and knoweth it not what does that mean a man well there's something they should know what they don't know and I trust brother sister that that we're not guilty of that the things that we should know we don't know I pray the grace of God that we know what God wants us to know that we're not going to miss the revelation that the generation back years ago missed during the ministry of a prophet and and they this has happened this has happened this is gone this is fulfilled that's fulfilled God's doing this and he's to watch the problem he said they don't know it a man because they think this they think that and they're believers the same thing they're thinking this they're thinking that a man but brothers sister they don't know what they should know so god help us it's I pray great step we're gonna know what we should know a man and and and their lies I said I believe their last service that after after their brides gone dead they're gonna still gonna be preaching the message oh yeah they be here preaching the message that's why they're when we ask the question I thought it was to you a rapture already happened they didn't know it oh yeah I saw I believe there's gonna be pro con believers that are gonna be left behind why because to get into the intellect of it the letter of it but not the spirit of it and they're gonna miss it and they are missing what God is doing in the resurrection and the rapture amen so in the book of Proverbs as we go into the message and know that not chapter 1 and beginning to read at verse 22 how long ye simple ones will deal of simplicity and that word means ignorance ignorance hour long he simple ones will ye love ignorant and thus corners delight in their scorning and the fools eight knowledge you know turn you at my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you and I will make known my words unto you because I have called and he refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have said it not all my counsel and were none of my reproof did it recognize what God was doing and what God was saying regarding is his word I also will laugh at your calamity I will mock when your fear cometh and when your fear cometh as this desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you and these things are coming upon a generation that misses the rapture and then shall they call upon me but I will not answer a man they shall seek me early but they shall not find me for that they aided knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord a man choose the fear of the Lord in hearing his word choose the fear of the Lord in receiving his word a man to believe his word and it said they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof this is amazing therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices brother make sure we got his way and his devices make sure we're doing what he wants us to do because the Private Eye lights in the message on the anointed ones at the end time concerning false Christ and he said in say a false Christ he says plural he said it oh yeah false Christ he said they are there they have the anointing to Christ anointing he said but they have false teaching he said they're not following the leadership he said of Christ he said they got the anointing but he said they had their own ideas that they're gonna live by so brother's sister let's be careful this again let's make our colony and election sure by the grace of God oh I want the anointing I got the anointing yeah that's right but do you had the right teaching a man are you going to yield to his leadership therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way not your way but are we going to take God's Way and God's understanding and be filled with their own devices this is amazing for the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them but whoso arkin athon to me shall dwell safely not just a recognized and acknowledges anointing but to acknowledge his counsel and his word drag knowledge is revelation it's not what we think it's what he thinks a man and again there are those that can have the anointing of God in their flesh and the prophets that go to hell oh yeah well I got the anointing I got the anointing yeah but let's prove it by following his leadership a man but whoso arkin it unto me should dwell safely and shall be quiet from the fear of evil god bless his word you may be seated and turn with me to Revelation chapter 3 these are scripture references that the prophet of God I lighted in the message and knoweth it not in Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14 and this is where he gets his texts and knoweth it not and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith II a man it's finished the faithful and true witness and the beginning of the creation of God because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and he said I know thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot I would that thou wert cold or hot a man not lukewarm God doesn't like that lukewarm attitude that lukewarm spirit amen God wants you to be cold or hot to be on fire and he said I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm god help us this is serious because they are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot will spew thee out of my mouth so if you're lukewarm in your relationship with God if you're looking for man your relationship with with with the brothers and sisters of your faith if you're lukewarm a man in your relationship with Jesus brother God will spill you out of his mouth a man you'll spit you out god help us because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not and this was his sex and knoweth it not and this is a generation that we are living in they believe this they believe this but don't know what God sees they don't know what God is seen in you they don't know what God has seen in us what God has seen in this church it's not what you're seeing but it's not what this one Caesar that one sees what is God seen there others are there that might come and say oh this is a wonderful church and then this is a wonderful group of believers what does God feel about it does God feel the same way a man we pray the grace of God a man that we're that we have is Grace a man praise the name of the Lord it's not what a man sees is what God sees and it says because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing well praise the Lord God has blessed me God has blessed me with this God is blessing with that that's right a man God can bless us with many things and yet not be saved a man and he said I'm need of nothing and he said and knowest not that thou art wretched just think man sees one thing God sees another mine what God said what God sees light the man silver man sees light God sees darkness just think man thinks he got life and in far as God's concerned he's dead yeah grace brother this is how seriously is the hour that we're living brothers ever an hour an age that we got to make our calling and election sure is this one a man and we got it we gotta test it with the word morning noon and night Amen Genesis to Revelation Genesis to Revelation because of the hour that we're living in why because this is the most deceiving of all ages a man and so deceiving the Bible says it would deceive the very elect if possible yeah as well bad it's going to be in this hour and in this age that were brother they never dealt with these deceiving spirits in Luther's day in Wesley's day or even in the early Pentecostal age but in this hour a man because they they were there those spirits were there but not under the extent that they are here no no it's on a day it's in a greater measure in this hour and in this age there's more of it in this on this age than it was in the other ages a man it was just a little bit in the other ages but he got worse and worse and worse andhe finally jesus warned him he says he said be careful he said because if would deceive the very elect if possible why why does he the very elect because of the anointing yeah the anointing yes they're going to be deceived oh because they got they got the the Christ anointing because it is false Christ and the part of God said what is the false it's not a false Christ he said false anointing it's a false teaching he said he says they got the oil they got her true anointing he said it's the anointing of the Holy Ghost you gonna have that he said go to hell and he's yeah I'm right but he said what stop what it what is the the the problem with it he said they're gonna teach he said that which is not right he said they'll say this and say that amen but he stern they're not going to stay with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth a man a man is gonna head to it or take from it that's the truth just thinking that and yet they yet they know they know the anointing of God they feel the anointing of God that struck me brother when we get to that message on the anointing once at the end time anointing and we were thinking older anointed by the devil no no it's God's anointing amen but it's Satan's teaching Satan is there to influence them hey man don't let Satan influence you in your thoughts in your words or your deeds god help us amen by the weekend we could have that anointing and believe all we believe the master we've read the message we believe this we believe that a man but brother be careful Satan might be adding to it or taking from it and that's what he's done in every age god help us amen and he said thou sayest I am rich increased with Goods have need of nothing and he said and knowest not just think under the anointing they think this they think this they think that but Christ has no he said you don't know he said that you are wretched what wretched no Lord we don't feel that way do we well he's in regards to what you feel that's what you are again it's not what you think what does God think there's not what you say not what you feel is what God sees a man and God looked down and said you're Richard and you're miserable and poor and blind and naked spiritually your wretched spiritually and he said you're a poor spiritually you're a miserable spiritually and you're boring and naked huh they think they don't think that I think it's just the opposite but he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may us be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear a man who sees it God sees it and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may is see as God wants you to see as you need to see a male need not been on our guard because of the hour we're living being on our guard because of the warning Jesus gave us they would deceive the very elect if possible why I will deceive the elect I was going I was ago me that so that their clothes that it would deceive the elect of God to deceive the seed as it were professing to be the seat and our bed is it because it's going to be false Christ's false anointed ones and false prophets and show signs and wonders yeah god help us brother make sure if they're signs and wonders to make sure it's plenty to the word not man's interpretation of the word but God's revelation of the word concerning what he has done and what he is doing and what he will do a million praise that praise the Lord brother I tell you whatever God has done your point back and he'll show you what he's doing and give you the revelation of what he's going to do press on a may and Luther press on Wesley pressed on the Pentecostals were pressing on others were pressing on a main but is the bride moving on to the resurrection and the rapture amen God Elvis brother we're not going to be here looking for this looking for that but we're gonna be here because of what we have recognized God has been and what God is doing brother it's pushing us on to the resurrection it's pushing us on to the rapture to get out of here because the world is fading away the world is getting worse and worse the Great Tribulation is coming upon the world and what we're seeing happening around the world right now brother is a token it is evidence a man that it's on its way it's beginning oh well no that's this is not it no but it's it's leading up to that oh it's gonna get worse but this is just a beginning and it's o'mine God allows this and God will love maybe something else but it's just to get our attention and to get us to look up amen any one of these messages here the prophet of God again highlights it and says God all that God's going to do this and I was going to do that you let the devil do this you let the devil do that why he said to get us look up amen for the devil thinks we're gonna look down but he said God knows if we do this and this live we let Satan do that amen he said he's gonna strike us and we'll look up for the rapture hey man brother listen the Bible tells us when this happens when that Evans look up because your Redemption draws near amen so god help us brother now take it for granted a man would not take it as as a denominational Creed or a Dogma some you know oh yeah I believe this and I believe that no brothers sister it is the Living Word of God ministering to a living sons and daughters a man that are pressing on to the resurrection and the rapture a man is not looking back to what God has done is going forward to what God's going to do amen because the Lutheran stopped and just focused on what God did and the Worth and the Methodists and the others and the others and the others amen revival after eBay oh and they just stopped and focused on what God did and made a denomination out of it even under the Pentecostals God did this God knew that eight million and brother there's many a so-called message believer brother many of those churches our denominational Amen God did this a man and God is doing this but what's God going to do a man is he really getting us ready and giving us the faith amen to bring to pass what he's going to do to make it flesh what he's going to do the rapture and the resurrection amen not just point us to it but to manifest it in US and through us oh yeah he got that somebody that he's gonna make it flesh him he got her somebody that he's gonna bring it to pass him amen brother to someone even even the early Preta Costas brother I turn to this that they thought that the Pentecostal message was going to take us on to the rapture and the resurrection that the Pentecostal message they thought was going to bring the coming of the Lord but then when God brought it on the scene through the Ministry of a prophet they never did they knew it not amen because they felt they were this God did this God did that Richard increased with Goods and need of nothing and they didn't know their wretched miserable poor blind and naked spiritually Amen God let I'm going good I'm go on a man till they got away from the spiritual revelation of what God was buried and they just got an intellectual knowledge and understanding of it and everything was focused on the intellect of what God had done and today everything is focused on the intellectual knowledge and letter of the word of what God has done in this hour through the Prophet but I'll tell you this not many not many believers are focusing on the spiritual and catching the what getting the faith of the rapture faith of the Resurrection to revelation amen brother I pray grace that we're going to get more and more into the end of the faith for the change I tell III don't know what I trust you do yeah there you want to get out of here that you want to get out of here you want as to powder gada and again it's for aai lights again in this message and note that not he said you gotta want to go and he said God is waiting on you but there's too many believers waiting on God no gods waiting on you look we will God could say what are you waiting on me for well Lord for this but I've already done that I've already gave you the word I've already gave you the word to give you the faith of the resurrection the faith of the rapture amen and listen the dead in Christ are waiting on you I'm waiting on you amen there's this brother sister come for a man sister coffee come forward amen brother Jesus called nitrous for now brothers God's waiting you know waiting on us to call them for and the dead in Christ the prophecy is going to going to appear to the living Saints and we're going to change amen are they gonna appear to us because we're gonna have that faith a man as they appeared to Jesus they're going to appear to mrs. Jesus Christ amen gracious brother that we're going to lay in the word and the word is going to lay at us till we come to that perfect faith amen brother the perfect faith the prophet of God ministered on it now and then after that he ministered on what the rapture and he said we got to come to this perfect faith for the rapture brother God's done what he wants to do god what he's going to do now it's up to us to believe it and act on it amen sure brother sister I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may us be rich white raiment that thou may'st be clothed amen and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I say that thou may is see see what you should see and how you should see it and as many as I love a man as many as I love I rebuke and chasten but most don't want that kind of preaching but brother God's gonna do that what for to shake us God's going to do that to get us to focus on the rough faith Lord why is God doing this why is God doing that or or must be my lack of faith forgive me lord help me to get really into the spiritual revelation of what you have revealed a man a man and then the revelation of the rapture the resurrection is going to get more and more real brother grace that we that we're not going to be judged by those that know it not but that we know it what do you know a man I pray we know what God wants us to know amen and just consider all that God has done what for to give us the revelation of what we need to know amen and consider what God is doing to give us the revelation of what we need to know a million and again the public God said listen it's not the ministry as not ordained as a grow to preach and make you feel good make you feel good no no no no he said that he said they've done that for years no he said is to get you thinking more serious I am about yourself and there's preaching and there's ministries they'll preach while all makes you feel good Oh wonderful wonderful event raised the Lord and yet they're getting less and less right dream faith yeah they getting caught up in this and cut up in that oh that's wonderful amen whatever yeah well let a brother come out and preach the word yeah personally to get you into a more personal relationship with Christ a more personal relationship with the word and what God is doing to get you ready for the rapture that's more serious oh yes it's more serious amen brother we could go to the scripture and show you what God does and how God does it to get the people to be more serious more sincere amen God elfis so he says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten yeah brother he got to do that to bring us through the revelation we need he got a rebuke as' he got a chasing us amen be zealous therefore and repent yeah the ever zealous repentance and brother the believer the bride has got that repentant attitude and spirit constantly forgive me why because we're in this flesh Lord forgive me help me Lord to keep my attitude right my spirit right amen and he said behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice Amen and opened the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me Amen brother I pray Greece we're not something just with William Branham or something with Jesus he's feeding us amen and to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as also I overcame and then sit down with my father in is strong he that Anthony R forget your ears he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit is saying saith unto the churches grace to us brother not by coincidence that don't think that the Lord would have us to consider the thoughts of the message and knoweth it not because considering the message that we've been ministering on the god of this evil age and Satan's een a man brother do we consider and do we know the truth the revelation of the god of this evil age do we know the truth and the revelation of Satan's Eden are we recognizing father the brother/sister the things that God has prophesied the things that God has revealed to us in those messages amen are people recognizing the god of this evil age not as Jehovah but as the devil a mayor the same God got such a control changer got such an influence on the people a man that he becomes as it were a god a man and now it is Satan's Eden we've gone from God's Eden now we're down into Satan's Eden a man and brother in God's Eden Satan deceived and in insane scene the world has deceived a man and again praise the Lord Alleluia amen because jesus warned us that this debt that is in the last days the deception is going to be great we have to be on our guard you don't just assume you're in the message we don't you don't just assume that I'm a believer and you know I just got no worries no because you know I believe God sent a prophet I believe the seals are open I believe the mysteries of God are revealed so I believe this you know there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a rapture yes you believe all that but are you easy believing it in your head or in your heart a man for many they got it in their heads but they don't have it in their hearts amen and brothers not going to give you faith in your in your head no no you got to have it in your heart if it's gonna if there's gonna be be faith amen a revelation in your heart not knowledge in your head and the prophet of God does also I like that where the where the were we got the knowledge of it and the intellect of it but not not the spirit of it grace of God brother and then again there's too many so-called believers out there they got to let the intellectual letter of the other message but they don't have the spiritual revelation amen and they're motivated by the letter of it but not the spirit of it oh yeah oh oh yeah yeah the Prophet said this see again did they go by the letter of the Bible and they go by the letter what William Branham said or William Brown said this and you know what as I've said B I said some years ago I said they take the Bible and they'll skip this chapter or that chapter some they'll skip a book yeah just skip that one on there just read this one they'll just read that one I like this one I like that one yeah it's the same thing with the message of the revealed word amen brother they'll take oh that's all right you know I prefer this message I prefer that message but they're not getting into this one or getting into that one amen and if they do as I said before and after a reading reading the message as the Bible they'll skip this or that and then get into a message and you'll skip this paragraph skip that paragraph and all they're just just flip that page and go on to another one they're doing that many a believers doing it because if they weren't they wouldn't be living the way they're living that's right they wouldn't be acting the way they're acting to wouldn't have the spirit that they got they're lacking the Holy Ghost whereas one time most believers they just had the Holy Ghost praise the Lord hallelujah is all wonderful but now just came to the place where less and less and less got the Holy Ghost you know it's the truth grace to us brother you're gonna make your call and election sure make sure you got the Holy Ghost amen by the grace of God it's a generation that knows not that Satan is the god of this age it's a generation that knows not that the world is in Satan's they don't stop to consider that what's going on they just think well we got the message we don't have to worry with this they're not to worry about you do I had to consider it a man such as the absolute deception of the world we are living in it's a generation that feel they are rich increased with Goods and need of nothing brother it's three things but that tree is not perfect oh yeah rich increased with Goods have need of nothing oh yeah three three confessions of faith but it's not perfect faith yeah but Jesus said they know not what they know not that they are Richard miserable poor blind naked five that's grace but the grace they're not willing to acknowledge amen how many are willing to acknowledge what God says sees and ask forgiveness Lord forgive me for thinking that forgive me for having those ideas amen grace brother sister let's realized let's see it see ourselves as God sees us we're gonna see ourselves rich increase with goods that need of nothing but I tell you this Jesus sees us as Richard miserable floor blind that that's grace but can you accept that you're going to take the perfection or the grace the grace of Christ that sees us as we really are amen brother let's not put our faith in the flesh let's put our faith in our souls amen again oh I think for the most part most people are rich they are increased with Goods they have need of nothing yeah naturally a lot of oats spiritually because spiritually Jesus said you're Richard what I'm Richard yeah knowing that you're miserable you're poor and you're blind and you're naked what no Lord because it because the church thought they were this they were good they were fine not nothing wrong but God comes to all my see as man sees himself now let's see him as God sees him a man down through the church ages man sees this God sees that and God says repent repent brother drop us to God help us repent of our ideas god of us to repent of our of ours of our spirit trying to control us yeah god help us they are blind indeed so I pray grace to the elect and grace to the Bride of Christ brother that will not be blind to what God has done and what God is doing amen bear with me take what the Prophet is said he said let's think of the louder see in church age and it's condition does it describe you or is it just a church and he said as far as I know he said I don't see anything to enter at this time he said the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of the readiness of his church the church wasn't ready as far as he was concerned for the coming of the Lord are we ready for the rapture he's come now is getting us ready to go amen and he said I think that is one of the prophecies concerning Christ outside the church and he has and the church is not ready amen he said look at Cain's children now they went into it when the sons of God saw the daughters of men were fair and they had taken unto them but wives and God never did forgive them god help us he said God never did forgive and they perished in the wilderness he said every one of them died and he said without hope without God and is eternally lost he said damned forever he said though they had seen the goodness of God and though they had drank from the fountain that never runs dry they drank from the smitten Rock and they had seen the brass serpent perform miracles and they come out from the baptism of Moses in the sea and they had seen the hand of God and they had eaten angels food and not all those things but they married into it he said let women bring them in marry among them now he said committed not commit adultery just marry among them God never did forgive it a man why because they were not ordained to enter to mix with the others and listen though they drank water from the fountain and they drank from the smitten Rock God judged them and knowing that there was a smitten Rock God told Moses to speak but they provoked Moses Oh Moses shouldn't have done that shouldn't have done that no he shouldn't but who caused it it was the unbelief of the people it was the lack of faith of the people and Moses got upset and angry and he struck the rock and God rebuke Moses for it he said told you to speak to the rock yeah now he struck the rock and it water came forth so brother you'd be careful yeah so sometimes the ministry and brethren strike of the rock don't strike the rock of the reveal word speak the word amen amen and he said God never did forgive them for what they did in inter mingling and intermarrying and he said that's the second time it met now he should err were on a third time and more deceiving now than ever don't think you can't be to see the devil is there to deceive you that's right knowing that he shouldn't make you believe it's the truth when it's not he should make you believe it's all right but it's not oh this is God this is the Holy Ghost you'd better make sure that it's according to the Word of God make sure that it's according to the will of God what is the will of God for your life what is the leadership of God in your life we can we get feelings we want to do this we think this is all right that's all right your minute make sure it's the Holy Ghost yeah and again make sure it's the leadership of God because Satan can be there to influence you to deceive you grace the prophet of God brings out what we have quoted many times from Matthew 24 and as they set up on the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and Jesus said the first thing he told him he said take heed that no man deceive you amazing why because the greatest thing you're going to have to be on your guard is against deception oh not against this or that or the devil to do this the devil to do that no noises take heed that no man deceive you he did say the devil no man why because gonna be false christs they're gonna be they're gonna be men out there preachers out there they're gonna be anointed but they're gonna preach to go to teach you wrong the false teachings they're going to add to the word you're gonna take away from the word oh yeah be on your guard take Heat we'll bring out more on the on that revelation concerning false Christ's yeah oh yeah they're gonna be didn't have a true anointing but but a false teaching grace of God oh yeah the proper God brings that out other ministry and brother and bring that brought that out all that brothers anointed that brothers anointed oh that's cool that's good yeah but is the teaching watch the anointing on the teaching grace to us no wonder jesus said Jesus knowing what was going to come to pass not only what we had to deal with he said take heed that no man deceive you yea for he said there shall arise false Christ's false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that ever were possible they would deceive the very elect if yeah very elected if possible so we think we're elect they are near gird because the deception is so great they would deceive the very elect if possible don't get don't get there cause even believers to stumble yeah to compromise grace of God the prophet of God I lights even 9 to 24 in fact he reads about 15 earth there are more scriptures from Matthew 24 God Elvis grace he said the second time admit and now we're on the third time more deceiving than ever it is more deceiving now he said than ever yet it is and again it can be a spirit get on you spirit get on the path the preacher oh yeah a spirit get on the brothers get on the sister and they'll just think this way and think that way oh well yes yes and be deceived he said I know that's hard and I've often wondered in many ways how will it ever be why do I have to talk to so rational to the people he said what makes it so and yet I notice if it wasn't God there wouldn't be nobody and he said not a woman would sit and listen at me but he should they come back because there's somebody that's got an anchor of truth he said that's right regardless they know it's right he said though he said I know it's hard what what he was preaching and he was getting harder and harder and harder as he got near the end of his ministry a man a man he knew that he had to lay it in so God wouldn't wouldn't judge him for it for refusing to declare it amen and he said listen the people the women of the world the church is in the same stage he said what's the natural type the spiritual rate each time and he said I know it's not popular to say it and if a man is not ordained to say it you'd better not say it because you're impersonating and they said you'll get in trouble sure enough and he said I'm only building and he said the hour is so closer to him and he said when you're going to see something happen and when something is going to take place and he said all this background here he said has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shape the whole nation a man or brother not the nation we need to shake the bright shake the people but be on your guard look at yourself look at yourself in the mirror of the word and don't deny what you're seeing don't tell hold on I'll leave that no no you've got to deal with it if you're looking in the mirror of the word and God showed you this God's truth that didn't you got to deal with it oh no I'll just leave that with the Lord no God is true God want God leave me with you you got a deal with grace to us and he said remember he said the higher you rise in God the more sinful the whole thing looks oh yeah the higher you rise in God God's required more and more and more and you want to walk more and more in line with the word oh yeah amen you want to walk and live and live more pleasing to the Lord do you never please in the name of Jesus to many believers just assume too much I don't have to worry just leave that with the Lord and go on God's leading with you he wants you to deal with it there's too many more just a little I'll let God deal with that no God wants you to deal with it and if one thing God wants you to do is acknowledge it God wanted to deal with Alinea on to first acknowledge it and you confess it to him praise the Lord he says sometimes in prayer he says you can imagine when the Holy Spirit takes you up into a sphere that the whole thing looks chaos and then when you come back down he said you seem like you're to the people you're a rascal and you're nothing but all sarcastic and he should you're a fool because you stand as an old crank always rebuking the people but he said if you ever climb into these spheres one time when you can be in the presence of God not your emotion but through the genuine Holy Spirit lifting up he said the whole thing is written Ichabod the glory of the Lord has departed from the whole outfit Ichabod see it as God sees it amen God wanted you to get up and preach all of your believers God bless just a nice for you to see is here and those online at home and so on good praise the Lord yeah what does God see what does God see is God seen a son and a daughter or a religious person race to us a man remember Ichabod the glory of Lord has departed don't forget this don't forget this now he said people can live in in this spirit they can dance in the spirit they can shout in the spirit they can go to church in the spirit and he said they can absolutely have the real spirit of god anointed on that spirit but still be lost and he said just as the devil possessed as they can be with that spirit yeah and he said you can absolutely have the real spirit of god anointed on that spirit that's on you you know you can feel oh I feel the Holy Ghost I feel the Spirit of God yeah but you better make sure that the initial spirit you're dealing with is God controlled by God not the devil because the devil knows to speak this spirit on you that spirit on you your work on that God is there to help you overcome it the devil is there to help you you to it oh yeah that's all right don't worry about it Oh - so deceiving it would deceive the very elect if possible be on our guard amen so deceiving yeah you know oh but in my eyes to death that's not serious yeah but in the eyes of God it's this serious God's looking at our faith you know believe us thou this grace he said God helped this to sink in to me the whole thing is wrong God's Word is the ultimate and whatever that word says he said that's right and now he said the only way up here in these spheres that you could ever be in this little inside man he said you have to be for ordained because you were with God and you're a part of God amen he said I was in my father and I was also in my grandfather my grandfather's grandfather by seed I was in that and I was in Christ and you were in Christ before the foundation of the world and he came to redeem his own in his own that was in him hallelujah his children that was in him he came to redeem us those that he saw in theophany form he come to redeem his seed amen and brothers were truly redeemed a man truly forgiven truly got the revelation of it the Spirit of redemption brother we're going to we're going to live on a level that religious people don't live on we're higher by the grace of God he said he never come to deceive or he never come rather to save the devil's children he said they never will know it and they are so shrewd in the ways of their intellectual learning yeah he said that you can't compare with them at all and he's you can't talk them but he said by faith you see it by the grace of God amen they're with me amen and brother branham explains the dreams that certain brethren had for their junior Jackson at a dream and he explained it's rather random yeah putting brother Branham on his guard because of his ministry and brother Leo Mercer at a dream I don't have time to get into those dreams and brother Roy Roy rather Roy Roberson at a dream three of those brothers had dreams and they all come to brother Branham because all the dreams were for brother Branham you know to put brother Brett and brother Branham as they were on his garden on his toes concerning what was going on in his life brother of God dealt with the Prophet in that way how much more is God going to deal with us grace Sewell brother to have that humility to humble ourselves to what we're seeing in the mirror of the word oh I see this and I see that my brother come here when it comes to the word the word is here to correct us the word is there to get us to line up with the will of God what is the will of God amen brother sisters does not just apply the will of God to just spiritual well it's the will of God for the believe there's one God the will of God to believe you know and water baptism in the name it's the will of God to believe this well what what is the will of God for your life are you in the will of God for your life doing what God wants you to do and again when where and how I want you to do it there's a lot of believers brother they might be in the will of God spiritually when it come when it comes to or the doctrines of the scripture of the Bible and they know I believe this I believe that yeah but are you in the will of God for your life your day-to-day living I'll tell you this that's not there's not not many believers that are in the will of God for their day-to-day living and I'd like to be honest you know by grace of God that I have constantly in in in in growing up and in in education and getting getting a job getting training getting this getting that I I would always said Lord what is your will do you want me to do this Lord because I've got training for this and I got training for that or something else and then the Lord is this your will so I prayed about it and then ask goddess Lord if he sure will then I'm asking you to to let this work out this way let this happen this way and and the Lord would if it was his will the Lord did it that way as I asked him amen this is absolutely amazing so but how many people and it's for the glory of God but how many believers today make decisions without seeking the will of God I'll let the be honest most believers get up I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that and and they just go do it they don't stop to consider maybe it's not the will of God oh well I don't think the Lord mine if I do this I don't think the lord of mine if I go here go there no yeah he died he will so the Bible says sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God amen and in all your ways you acknowledge him that's the Bible but yet most people think all I got to do is is acknowledge God spiritually and in my baptism in the church I go to and this no it's in everyday living so there's not you that lives it's Christ that liveth in you and I allowed to be honest it's not correct Christ is not living in many believers a few because there's only a few others going to seek the Lord and to seek his counsel nice we'll what is your will Lord a man god help us because again many have their will based on reading rich increased with Goods and have need of nothing oh I believe that's the will of God yeah oh yeah oh God Oh Lord you bless me well you did this you did that and Jesus said you're Richard you're miserable you're poor and you're blind and you're naked why no Lord so we got this and we got that yeah but that God didn't give it to you that was you under the anointing of the devil oh yeah Satan told Jesus you do this and I'll do I'll give you this you do that and I'll give you this you worship me and he's on my I'll give you the control of the kingdoms of the world yeah I think I said Satan Satan as I would dare to do this say I would do that and people think it's God and it's not and Jesus said get behind me Satan how many would say that most today would think oh that's God Lord you blessed me oh you've got to prosper me you're gonna do that no sometimes God takes it away from there not give to you yeah well for you bring in your faith also that's alright Lord I know and you lead you but you'll be with me and you'll help me and you you you take me through yeah you know and if he blesses you then you're not gonna you're not gonna put your emphasis on that you're gonna say thank you Jesus oh I'll do it I'll use it for your glory glory they are said a month on eternity no most want to use it for their own glory but not the glory of God grace amen it's like that man just think when the prophet of God was here he was here and he was a millionaire and he would help support the ministry yeah but he didn't start out he started out very good but just remember what he did oh yeah he had a house and he had this knee had that it was good good good and finally in a dream the Lord dealt with him and told him to sell his house or to give it not sell it he give it to somebody yeah give it to somebody he mentioned to his wife and it was to a preacher I think and he told the dream to his wife she said yes she said I believe it and so they did it the will of God and where do they go from there gave this person that house they moved out and he moved into somebody they knew that was that was where it rich and she told them that they could live in the inner garage so they would left her house and went and lived in the garage oh yeah that's where they lived they slept morning noon and night and he went and did work here did that did that but they said did all they could do for this woman yeah - finally God blessed him and he became a millionaire yeah why God blessed him but he paid the price and if God took it from him he didn't mind if God gave it to him thank the Lord and he used it for the glory of God oh yeah and God and brother he came and he supported brother Branham he would have me to help here or help there and help somewhere else support of other others or their ministries as well it's her brother but if God took it from him he'd accepted as the will of God would you grace a tent or a cottage why should I care I like what that brother said he preached it years ago and I got it on tape somewhere and he said he said you're gonna he said yes where you sing he said the biggest lies you said you tell is in church he you sing those lies in church he said a tenor a cottage why should I care they're building a mansion for me over there but he should you do care he says not many say can really sing it and it's the truth most want a cottage but they don't want to tempt delivah but there's others out there they got the right spirit and right attitude if the Lord told to go live an attempt they live in a tent like that man lived in that courage yeah oh yeah if God wanted him stay there he'd stay there amen not my will father time be done and because he's added he was right the Spirit was right God left him a man to God be the glory listen he said referring to brother I Roberson's dream and he said it pact you toward the West brother branham he said I cried and walk the streets and after a while I went and sat at the table I happen to look up there at the head of the table and I could just see that much of you was snow weight and you were standing there and said you spoke with authority and there was no guessing to it every man understood exactly what you said oh my brother sister now every one of you conscious I know he said what that means just watch stay close to Christ and let me warn you as a minister the gospel don't take any foolishness don't imagine not anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're right in Christ because there's only one thing going that's going because we're in the most deceiving age that we ever lived in it would deceive the very elect if possible because they have anointing and they can do anything like the rest of them he said clean up your lives pay your debts and oh no man he said in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen again this was august 65 and not long after that the prophet of god was taken off the scene amen so brother grace to us the prophet of god been gone for many years over 50 years so where is our faith after all these years we are still here still thanking God for what he did still getting into him oneness with what he's with what he did for the revealed word and still moving on by the grace of God toward the resurrection and rapture how much longer I pray and pray and pray Lord how much longer will it be before were changed into a glorified body please Jesus grace that we haven't missed the rapture and I'm praying and praying and praying and crying and crying and crying lord help us lord please that we haven't missed the rapture grace he said what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a lodge he said Christ can't listen he said Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us I believe we are at the end he was nearing the end of his life I pray grace that the bride is nearing the end of time to get into eternity grace please don't take for granted what's going on in the world the coronavirus that's just not something casual but I believe is one of the signs of the end because again the prophet of God warned concerning the Greek this is going to happen he said in the world this is going to happen that's going to happen he's to remember he said there's coming a Great Tribulation upon the world and all that's going on now is going to lead to that Great Tribulation don't assume is just a casual thing it's just such just so it did that just happen that just happened no no brother I pray God that it's going to produce in us what the Scriptures tells us it should look up how many believers are really looking up for the rapture now expecting any time to experience the change many believers were taking a casual oh well that's God judging the world God join oh yeah there's in the world what's he doing for the bride you know the world's gonna do this world's gonna do that God is doing this guy's doing that but what's he looking for in the bright he's looking for that bright he looks down and sees err look you know why because she knows for a Redemption the rapture is that hand grace brother sister that we're not going to miss the rapture be on your guard he said old God he said where is the man where is man man that's man and he sir that stands for a principle where is women that stands for a principle where is a church that stands for a principle he said I ain't got a nickels worth of time for a wishy-washy give in compromising spirit in a person or in a church he said where's a man that is standing for what's right he said where is a man he said that's not afraid to speak out regardless if the whole world is against him hmm he's a speak out for what's right he said stand for it and die for it by the grace of God so the grace of God be with us to help us amen because what we know not good and brother if it's not having the desired effect in our lives then we don't know it the way we should when I seen it the way we should we're not understanding the way we should we're not taking of the way we should brother but if we if we know it what's going on we know what's coming to pass in the world even concerning this coronavirus and other things that are taking taking input taking place or coming to pass in the world the prophecy that's being fulfilled we know the rapture is that an come on do we want to go do we want to stay amen I pray grace that we want to go he said 'no god let me stand with the principles of one man as a minister the word of Jesus Christ so I pray grace that will all stand for the word will all stand for what God wants to do and what God is doing concerning the resurrection and the rapture praise the name of the Lord grace that we know what God is doing amen grace that we're on our guard that God want judges with those who know it not but as those who know it amen the grace of God be with you nore bless you miss Dan amen the grace of God by the Holy Ghost we know it amen that it is the end the grace of God by the Holy Ghost we know it that it's the time of the resurrection it's the time of the rapture think about it every time you want to drive through the city or drive through somewhere else and you see a cemetery how can you just go through a past the cemetery and not think about the resurrection nothing with the rapture oh yeah it's only just a couple of days ago that I was driving past the cemetery I said oh Lord oh Lord my heart went in to her sister Coffee was

you what for come for Lazarus were waiting on Jesus yeah and Jesus said Lazarus come forth yeah yeah and then we know that the Bible says Jesus cried he wept and they were saying he cried for look oh he loved Lazarus and he cried because Lazarus was dead no he didn't he was crying because of their unbelief they didn't believe why why would Jesus cry when he was when he was the resurrection life he said he said Lazarus not dead he said he sleeps yeah so brother for years and years and years and still there's a generation millions still believe Jesus cried because Lazarus was dead but he wasn't because Jesus said he sleeps and he said I go wake him so if they're not dead you're just asleep you go to cry for that person if there's somebody you know a family member or a friend of just laying there oh dear sleep okay well wake them up later yeah you're not gonna cry and Jesus wasn't gonna cry over Lazarus definitely not no he cried because of their unbelief but just think he turned his Lazarus takeaway to stone when he said what take away two stone let's come forth he knew he knew Lazarus was going to hear he knew lasers were going to respond he knew lasers were going to walk out of that tomb yeah praise the name of the Lord do we have that same fate for the resurrection of our sister coffee sister Dunford and other saints that are gone on waiting on us grace of God to us God
