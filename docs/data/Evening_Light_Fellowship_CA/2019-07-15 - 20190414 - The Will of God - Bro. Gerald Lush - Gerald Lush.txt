now I believe that our brief God on the scene now how do you a quickens the power of God now in our lives because now we believe now in the present tense praise the name of the Lord all things are possible because now I believe praise the name of the Lord Amen god bless you turn with me to the book of proverbs chapter 6 the book of proverbs chapter 6 as we go into the word and maybe I might have ministered on it some time ago but we'll see there are a number of scriptures that I want to share with you please let's pay attention to the word a man man it's called on to ribbet to believe the truth whole truth and nothing but the truth Amen God gives us his word and God has instructed us not to head or to take away but to leave it the way that it is amen and to believe it the way that God has written it and let him by the grace of God and by the Holy Ghost let him bring it to pass amen it is in his way is time whether it's in your life or somebody else's life a man let him do it amen it's not doing what's right in your eyes is doing what's right in the eyes of God a man and there's too many still doing what's right in their own eyes and they're acting as human beings but not as the sons and daughters of God I mean they're gonna do what they do as a god amen because ye are God's you're the sons of God amen so we're going to go there and live as God you're going to talk as God you're going to do this and do that as God would do it amen so brother it's it's a reflection that it's not me that lives as Christ that liveth in me there's this tremendous brother what God requires of us in these last days well he's required it all down through the ages and it wasn't it wasn't man as a worry and enable it was God enable it was God with Abel it was God with Noah's God with Enoch brothers sister amen you talk about being in the will of God they must have been in the will of God most definitely and to receive what God wanted them to receive to do what God wanted them to do and and to say what God wanted them to say a man see they they're born they were born again God had control there and God has control of us through the finish work of Calvary amen they had a relationship with God you and I got a relationship with God amen so the grace of God to us as we go in and that's what I want to share with you in some thoughts on the will of God a number of scriptures and again we're familiar with the message that the prophet of God preached in 19 and 65 in November 19 and 65 and it was entitled trying to do God a service without his will amen you could be you could be doing this for God doing that for God but it's not the will of God and there there are thousands and thousands today guilty of that oh they I'm doing this for God I'm doing that for God but check it with the word a man and check it with the Holy Ghost in your heart is it the will of God amen so we've got it we've got to conclude as Jesus did not my real father dying be done amen and brothers over this is good yeah but that doesn't mean as God wants you to do it Amen the devil does some good things too you know and to deceive the people so brother what we do we got to do more the will of God and we got to do it for the glory of God amen god Elvis that what we're doing today is according to his will well we will do after the service is acordes will what you do at work at school no matter where it is it's according to the will of God amen but there's too many again as there was with Israel sorters with with the Gentiles there's too many that's doing what's right in their own eyes yet religious a man just like Cain so raised to us to fight to submit ourselves to the will of God and in proverbs chapter 6 and verse 1 my son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou as stricken Dyan with a stranger thou art snared with the words of thy mouth that are taken with the words of thy mouth do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou are come into the hand of a friend go humble thyself amen and make sure they go not sleep to thine eyes or rather give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids deliver thyself as a roll from the hand of the unter and as a bird from the hand of the Fowler go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise and it says which having no guide overseer or ruler provided her meat in the summer and gathered her food in the harvest how long will those sleep o sluggard when will they rise out of thy sleep god bless his word he may be seated go back to proverbs chapter 5 just showing you with the scriptures the faith comes by hearing the word amen and in proverbs 5 he said in verse 1 my son attain unto thy wisdom and bow die near to my understanding that thou mayst regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge amen and back to chapter 6 again the scriptures that I have shared with you before quite some time ago and he said verse 16 he said these six things that the Lord hate do we ate them yay seven are an abomination unto Him a proud look a man do we hate it that we're not looking in the mirror we're not going to the stores to get what we feel we want to get so that we're going to look proud we're going to look good in the eyes of man what out here look in the eyes of God and the question is what is the will of God amen because some can control it others let it control them a man others can dress no matter what they want to do it there but again doesn't bother them doesn't matter to them as long as it's proper decent clothing and so on so he said a proud look and a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood and an heart that devises wicked imaginations he says feet feet that be swift in running to mischief amen we're hid hurry to do their to do what we want to do sometimes and as and it's the mischief it is sin in the eyes of God but not running to do what God wants us to do amen now I'm any gonna lay down their lives as he did many years ago and it says the false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren these are the things that God hates a man were there to encourage one another in the Lord Amen and give God the glory and so he said my son keep thy father's commandment forsake not the law of thy mother and bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck and when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when the way cos it shall talk with thee amen God is our Father and our mother a man if we recognize the natural father and mother what about our spiritual father and mother a man we want a close relationship with the natural how much more do we wanted with the spiritual a man the eternal because the natural passes in the way because when we get the glory they're not going to see that woman and say that's mom no no if she makes it it's it's your it's your sister in the Lord and you're not her son you're your brother in Christ a man see all of these things changed and again as I said in that book that somebody gave me one time and I turned around of years later and I gave it back to somebody that belonged to that denomination and in that and once they read what it was but in that book they're paintings of the resurrection and right they said this is the resurrection and in the painting oh my it was Jesus up there in the cloud that's fine that's good but the rest of it was wrong the resurrection here they err they had little boys and little girls coming out of the grave and there they had old men and old women coming out of the grave and here they had others judge me in their Middle Ages who were coming out of the grave but the thing of it is in glory there there there there no old people there's no there's no babies there's no young people there's no infant of days nor nor an old man that has not fulfilled his days the Bible says that so but - why Jesus came to change that and give us the give us and heater body a man has eternal sons and daughters of God a man and brother I tell you this in any ringing glory and in heaven any it's eternity it is not time a man no way the angels are not getting old amen God's not getting old amen our theophany bodies are there that are getting old amen they're waiting for us to come back in a in a redeemed form and and receive that go into the oven e and receive glorified bodies a man Jesus came to accomplish all of that a man God God gave the promise from the beginning praise the Lord right now from the beginning right on to the end I'm when I'm going to receive but like again that what happened in the Garden of Eden and many of many many feel that well God did this and the devil did that but your God knew it and God allowed it and God permitted it and was all for a reason because God wanted to reveal his character and again Eve she said because she was a byproduct amen she wasn't that she wasn't of the original creation because God created Adam a man under the dust of the earth God made him a man in in his own image as it were and but he took he took part of Adam and made the woman a man so she was a byproduct and that was the weakness that she had a man so that when the enemy came he we could not do TV Adam but he they deceived the woman but when he deceived the woman and she went to the man and any and he saw what she had done and she expanded in this this and this well he couldn't he could have went back to where he fellowship with God and told God about it that in and told God maybe that he wanted another woman a man that he would want to divorce her a man but no so what did Adam do what he did Adam Adam submitted himself to her a man anything he did what the serpent had done to her and so on why did he do that a main thing God for the message of the hour they gives us understanding he said Adam but himself in sin Lisa with eat so he said that God redeeming him would redeem her a man praise the Lord hallelujah and understand - when God came down and judge them God judged the woman and God said to the serpent but God didn't judge the man he judge the earth for the man a man and he said to the woman he's now he said no he said impatiens you till you bring forth children a man and give birth and to the serpent he said now he said he says you're not going to no longer walk as a work but he said what are you going to do is you're gonna you're going to be going to the dust of the earth amen his legs come off his arms come off because people still think that he that he was he was a snake no no no back then he was the missing link between man and beast a man and he and he walked he had arms he could talk with man a man so close to the hand that he could could mingle with man a man that's why the serpent got in and he used the or the devil got in and he used the serpent to the CV amen and God came down and he cursed the woman and I put a curse on her and he put a curse on the serpent and then as I said the legs come off the and then the arms and you know and I'm not a few years ago I believe it was that I got a report regarding the what the scientists had discovered in certain serpents that they discovered just going and going in the dust of the earth and they discovered there well there's something here in the serpent and there's something down here in the serpent and they were wondering what it was we know what it was if this is where this is where the arms were and this is where the legs were a man but God cut it off and he said dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy light a man so he was no longer an upgrade creature now he was cursed and put down but when it comes to the man God come to the man and he's know she should have done what you did this is over because you did it he said I cursed the ground for your sake amen and in the sweat of your brow so you bring for a man so so the curse is and again that ought to humble our sisters and the brother God has warned us that we are living in in in a woman's world and that is the truth because more and more and more the women are taking control more and more the world the women are expressing what they feel and what they want and so on and trying to force the world to yield to their will a man then again that proves that we are back in the Garden of Eden again and so the sisters need to be on their guard a man by the grace of Almighty God don't think I'm a believer so I have a Christian and I'm this right I don't have no worries oh yes you do Amen you could understand that that curse is still there amen amen but it's only through Christ are we going are we redeemed amen so this is tremendous that God sent a prophet to bring out these revelations and to bring out these mysteries in these last days so that we may know that what happened in the beginning and we all know what's going to happen in the end a man by the grace of Almighty God a man thank God so brother I pray the grace of God help us that we're going to be we're going to stay with the will of God amen hey man the will of God and that will of God is right now for us it is revealed in the Word of God amen back here in the Garden of Eden the will of God was revealed personally from God to Adam and Eve but after the fall a man God was going to deal with him by faith it is by grace through faith after the God put him out of the garden God was going to deal with with Adam and Eve and Abel and Enoch and Noah and all of them and what is it by grace through faith a man so and they would be they would find the will of God by grace through faith now we do know that even in the Old Testament they were going the Bible says by faith they did this by faith they did that and so on so that was the grace of God for them to reveal the faith that pleased God and what it what is the faith it is the revelation of the will of God it is a revelation what God wants them to do amen not just to believe in God not just to believe this or believe that you got to believe the will of God for your life amen because it becomes a very personal situation a man so brother-sister that this is the important thing it's the the payor we think faith is believe in this doctrine faith is believing that doctor faith is believing the revelation of the will of God for you amen and part of it is believing the truth part of it is believing the word but God in control of you wants to do this God in control of you wants to do that Amen so it's not my will thing be done amen you're not going to do what's right in your own eyes you're going to do what's right in the eyes of God we're gonna live free to do that you got to live in the spirit a man you got to live in the spirit and you got to walk in the spirit now brother you're not you're not doing what your natural human spirit once you're going to do what the Holy Spirit wants hey man amen praise the name of the Lord that's why God ordained are they ordained this remain to stay in the will of God and that is by grace through faith brothers by grace through faith in the old testament by grace through faith in the new testament a man but there are so few that are recognizing what go to the will of god and they are not in the will of god they are out of the will of god amen they think I'm in the will of God because I'm in the message no no you go you go to the message is going to be in you amen the message is in you and in your heart and in your soul you're going to do the will of God amen you're going to be controlled by the word controlled by the message and you're going to be controlled by the will of God the Holy Ghost amen not my will but thine be done brothers a tremendous testimony and there's a tremendous witness you know concerning the will of God for you to be in this service this morning amen the will of God were and I trust they got the revelation of it the will of God forever our sister Kimberly here our sister amber here sister Brazil a man to be married to Newfoundlanders Amen so the grace of God brother and believer brother very earlier and brother Josh when the Columbo's there's some other guys with them to be here a man not my real father thine be done a man brother sister I pray their grace here to her to our brother Columbo I pray that glacier to his wife here and his daughters and so on the old mine not my will then be done brother it's the will of God that has taken us back hey man we got to get into the revelation of the will of God to get back get into the revelation will of God to please God a man by the grace of Almighty God amen so brothers sister again is a tremendous testimony tremendous witness and again for those that you got well you agree either going to acknowledge it or deny it and even where our brothers had to be here brother Alec to be here hey man praise the name of the Lord maybe and yet maybe there are others they were here and laughed and they should be here amen say but that man is doing what's right in his own eyes they're doing why they feel is good and what they feel they'll enjoy and whatever you know what they feel is better for them but when brother I tell you this what God considers better is one thing will you consider matters another well you consider best for you you know oh it's good for me well well good what do you mean it's like again like I said my father has told us often and we were growing up he said you're good well he said there are two kinds of good you're good or good for nothing so he said what are you and so it's to make sure you shoes are good make sure you're good for something not good for nothing a man so to be good for something you had to be in the will of God a man 9 my real father then be done and others of vast majority of believers that are not in the will of God amen no way they're not in the will of God where they are they're not in the will of God what they've done and where they did it and how they did it and so on just how do they think because I'm in the message and I'm in a message Church the other maybe God don't want you to be in this when the church organ or that message maybe God if they're there God want some here Amen hi brother a witness that over over the years and I could go and tell that tell this brother this tell that brother this or sister this and then they're not gonna do believe me they're gonna do what's right in their own eyes a man and others know Anna for the glory of Almighty God there are others set back over the years they have said listen why don't you go ask for the journal and and see see what the will of the Lord is amen and I'm still getting getting getting the emails still counseling the people still trying to get them to the revelation of the will of God amen and again as I say there are others that have said oh I don't like being around brother Jareau lost reason because he knows what I'm thinking and that's the truth and I said what I said if I knew whether thinking I'm not going to say anything so and then the power of God did the same thing he would walk away and so on amen but no that's just I give the glory to God brother and I believe that God has called me and I trust I trust by the grace of God as the prophet said I hope you don't believe me behind when he comes a man even the Prophet was acknowledging that he knew he said are you looking for mistakes easily I got lots of them he's like a lot of mistakes a man so he such I trust he said he won't leave me behind he said when he comes and we think all this as one person don't have no worries that's brother branham oh yeah because the privacy right on through the Bible and then the Apostles right on through the scriptures brother they've made their mistakes and then they're trying when God found them out of his will not in his will hey they were doing what was right in their own eyes are following their own leadership and not God's leadership oh yeah no brother there that we could I like the the Ministry of certain prophets and I can i light even the Ministry of Paul the Apostle and there were things that Paul did and he was the will of God Avengers think it was things that he did and getting out of the will of God brother o mine the devil is the devil is there to torment you the devil is there to detest you has to work because because Paul explains one thing in where then it wasn't the will of God and he said we did this and we did that we did this and he said we got to the place where we wish we were dead yeah because they were they had to endure this and they were that and it wasn't God that led him into it it was it was they was their own leadership it was what they were thinking in their minds when not following the leadership in their hearts a man it was the will of the devil but not the will of God hey man and he gave Satan a controlling our thoughts and to get us to do what our thoughts are saying instead of following revelation of what God wants us to do hey man see again Cain when did the revelation of what the devil wanted to do and his nature Abel and do what God wanted him to do hey man he had a revelation was my paid by faith by faith by faith man again Ebru zebras 11 is tremendous revelation of God dealing with his sons and daughters all down through and it is by faith and is my faith what is it it is the revelation of the will of God he always a revelation of this a revelation of that yeah but the revelation that God wants you to enter into a oneness with a man that is his will a man even in your everyday living and I I just that I had an email from a brother and he said brother he said you are my elder Easy's and he's a and he's the pastor himself but he said I consider you to be my elder brother and he said brother would you Lisa would you please counsel me I need help please tell me what to do in these circumstances and these situations and he highlighted three or four situations that he that he was dealing with anyone accounts as to what to do and how what is the will of God a man so brother what is the will of what is the will of God that I should do here what does the will of God I should do in this situation in these circumstances and so I I have counseled him about three times on certain things and no he said I'll be back he said there's another issue he said that I want you to counsel me on amen so brothers sister the oh my god have mercy on us but that we're there were going to be found in the will of God not in the will of the church not in the will of the devil not in the will of you just religion but in the will of God which is the Word of God amen amen and again it's got to be according to God's revelation and it's got it according to the way that God wants this will see it and the way that God wants us to believe it and the way that God wants us to do it amen and so that was so that it's going to control everything else that we do amen again there's not me that lives us Christ I live within me just thinking all your ideas it's the Lord it's the Lord it's the Lord amen anyway listen when you go to work do you pray Lord I want you to help me today nyjah's Lord protect me but lord I want you to help me so that I'm going to do your will I'm going to do it the way you want me to do it I'm going to I'm going to act the way that you want me to hack I want to talk the way you want me to talk and so on amen praise the name of the Lord brother it is a challenge that again and again there's no wonder jesus said Strait is the gate and narrow is the way and through their me they find it amen because there's not many they're going to let go of what they want to do and just stay with what God wants them to do a man because they feel that they're over I'm not going to enjoy life if I do this I'm not going to enjoy life if I let that go let that go if I don't do this I don't do that or if I don't go here and go there I won't enjoy like brother sister you know you're not going to have light now in no way they're going to be kicked out they're going to be cut out but as they get ahead by the grace of God as I told our brother Billy Paul when when we were down there a couple of years old and I said hello and he just ran and shook my head and he said thank you thank you thank you brother for what you've done and I said brother listen what we did we did for the glory of God and I said what we and I said we lived for the glory of God I said we didn't live for ourselves we live for Jesus and I said we weren't looking for the next long holiday we were looking for a holiday there so we could go here and go there go somewhere else I said we were looking for those holidays so that we could so we could go fellowship with their brothers and sisters somewhere else amen maybe that's the absolute truth money amen amen but yet people want to know and all due respect they want to go to Florida or they want to go there and they want to go there holiday and so on well brother our holidays back there years ago our holiday shows that we enjoyed it only if we were with the brothers and sisters in the faith we enjoyed it by going here to help them going here they do a fellowship with them going there to encourage them a man by the grace of God oh it was wonderful hallelujah because why we be we're the Holy Ghost they had the Holy Ghost amen we were feeding on the word we were looking for eternity they were looking for eternity and so on see if brother Mike what a tremendous thing it is to be in the will of God and to live for God and to have the revelation reality in you that is not you to live 9 let me live it as trace living in me hey man and if Christ is living in you what's he going to do he's going to do this he's going to do that he's a man even the early church they went from house to house to house the house and fellowship fellowship fellowship fellowship morning noon and night by the grace of Almighty God brother sister and the individual with that attitude in that spirit that's the ones Alleluia that's the ones who are dating for the rapture that's the ones that are going in the resurrection that's the ones they may are going to the marriage supper of the lamb by the grace of God amen that's what they are living for they're not living for this world because this too shall pass away and brother then we are we're living in an age where in the private oh God said this is faster dude that is past dude that is past due even the company of the Lord is past due buddy buddy should we hunger and we thirst for it amen because we know that we're living in the hour of the resurrection we're living in the are the rapture this way and we believe it is past dude and he's for that that's why we're hungry and we're thirsting for it hey man and but where why are we where are we holding back he says it's for maybe for this brother for that sister for somebody else he said we're holding back and praying the grace of God to them maybe the last one to come in a man by the grace of Almighty God they can be realized now according to the will of God and the will of God is the word of God and according to the will of God brother sister that there is very little in the scriptures left to be fulfilled a man because practically 99% of the truth is fulfilled there was a time when the part of God so we are three minutes to midnight but brother I was save early a few seconds to midnight and I'd say a few seconds in the mind of God because 1,000 years there's one day as I and one day as a thousand years a man so brother closed early to the resurrection I closed early to the rapture because there is very little left to be accomplished in the earth it is a woman's world and then the Antichrist is rising in popularity and another thing we see what's going on in Israel a man I could explain to you concerning the prophecy we don't have the time but a concern the prophecy about America and about Russia and about Israel and about and about England and in other states the things of the prophet of God mentioned he said America crossed the line between mercy and judgment he said in nineteen and fifty seven I read that age and run that time they crossed the line well what do you mean cross the line between mercy and grace a man between between the grace of God and the judgment of God and America has been for many years now under the term it of God and that's why we are witnessing what's going on there now that was not the America that I knew back in back fifty years ago no no there's not the America that I knew forty years ago maybe thirty years ago but in those last number of years everything has changed and is changing around the world I pray God give us eyes to see a man again that we're going to look through his eyes and we're going to see that we are it has come to pass and it is coming to pass Amen why what has come to pass the prophecy concerning the end of the end time and we're in the public artistry there's coming a germ warfare and and that's on the earth now hey man old brother a view a view if you have checked your the internet and some of the news here some of the news there and they're warning about these diseases these diseases these diseases and it's all around the world and it's as our brother George and sister Rebecca spoke and a number of years ago in the believers international monthly letter that they sent out and they were they were dealing with German the term warfare and they they highlighted the fact that is not going to be new germs it's going to be it's going to be the old germs that are going to come back and they and what the cures are they that they profess to have back years ago is not going to work anymore a man so they said it's not the old new germs there's going to be the old germs a man and God according to his word is permitting it brother and sister brother and again in Matthew 24 and other references in the Bible concerning what we are going to witness in the last days we are witnessing a man it is coming to pass the scripture has been fulfilled and is being fulfilled what is left it is very absolutely very little when it comes to the Bride of Christ and the Gentile Church in Israel and Russia and what's going on in the Middle East brothers sister everything is happening so quickly a man and again this Benjamin Netanyahu they elected again as the Prime Minister of Israel he just barely got in but understand he is the Prime Minister now for the third season a man the third time brother sister is serious and it's all for a divine purpose I believe it's according to the will of God that he got elected back it's according to the will of God what's going on in Israel and it is according to the will of God what's going on in in the United States Amen God has promised itíd amen the American has crossed the line amen between mercy and judgment amen and they don't know the the churches across the line because they're part of God the messages inside the Father God preached the message the indictment and he said I and I do this this generate not only the church but I indict this generation and the governments and the world and the churches and religious people in data for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ the second crucifixion of the word it is serious brother sister Aaron the world if you got the Holy Ghost and you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you were and it's Christ living in you out of the world can you enjoy this world out of the world can you enjoy living here amen how in the world can you be content living in this atmosphere hey man as I said I'm not contained live any of this atmosphere I do then I do I do not enjoy living in this world because I've got a greater revelation of the world to come and have a new heaven and a new earth and I want to get there a made by the grace of Almighty God I want to get out of here and get into the kingdom of God I went and I just spiritually but but but naturally hey man you got to want it hey man you got to be praying for it you got any hungry for it you got to be thirsting for it by the grace of Almighty God and you got to be constantly what constantly praying Greece Greece they Lord that I'm gonna be in your will today your will today hey man listen and those are going there are through being the will of God he'll be the will of God for that person to go into the resurrection be part of the resurrection and be part of the rapture brother and only those in the will of God will identify with the resurrection only those in the will of God will identify with the rapture amen the will of God and what you want to do your doing for the glory of God hey man praise the name of the Lord so that they're going to really give the glaive that give glory to you use ask the grace of God amen if you're going to lift you up that's the grace of God ain't man and it is it is for the glory of God amen so they're they're not going to give the glory to man and humanity but they're going to give it to divinity the divine creature even I our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ even Almighty God so God Elvis brothers sister in this hour to be to be in this later so that whether it's in your home whether it's whether it's in your job whether it's in your school you're in the will of God amen by the grace of Almighty God so they let us come to that place where where all of these things are going to leave us it's not where and we're going to leave it rather it's like that preacher preached in 1995 amen I was into a certain church and the minister was preaching and and he said the question and not even not even the message preacher and he said he said listen concerning your sin he said did you leave your sin or did your sin leave you a man he said one day down the road he said you're sitting we'll leave you but he said by the grace of God you leave in a man so God Elvis rather sister that our sin is going to leave us and not just leave us we're going to leave our sin because why is getting in the will of God and you're gonna you're going to go according to the will of God you will lay it down and have you said you repent said Oh Lord forgive me you'll walk away again by the grace of Almighty God a man thank God hallelujah see what see the thing that God is looking for in control of our lives it is the will of God a may be in the will of God believe the will of God stay with the will of God walk the will of God deliver the will of God any man whether it's a sister in her home or brother in a day's work or the young people in school or university the will of God is the important thing amen but they're getting more and more people that the world as is not in the will of God and brother churches are not in the will of God amen governments are not in the will of God the bride is in the will of God and God is bringing the elect Jews back in these will all brother what's going on there brothers it ought to put us on our toes hey may brothers would stand up and look up by the grace of God when you see this he said look up a man when you see this when you see that look how much the will have gone look up what is the will of God in your life in mind now is looking at is looking to eternity amen and we're getting more sensitive of that dimension and less of this one amen because that one is driving us to the other one amen what's going on in this world is driving us to that dimension and what God is doing amen amen me brothers sisters not far away here here's Katie doing what he did and Eira's able to but he did it wasn't very far from Abel because the Bible says he offered the more excellent sacrifice so brother the will of God is the more excellent sacrifice a man praise the name of the Lord the way the will of God and II know a man was the resurrection and the rapture the will of God in Nora amen watch what Noah did amen we're in a few souls were saved by water hey man that's what my mother quoted that many times why she wanted to prove that few was eight hey man we were always running well a few this and a few that well what's a few she said that's easy she said there was a few that were saved by water in the days of Noah and then and the few was ain't a man so brother still we never we would never forget it because of the way that my mother would bring it out or the way that my father would bring it out a man and there's too many scriptures area in Proverbs that my father would quote a man so we thank the Lord that they had an experience with God a man and anyway in transfers they were concerned it was the will of God haebang quote the scriptures remind your children of this Christmas tree raise them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord amen and that's the Word of God that's the will of God amen you want to know how to raise your druid nurture and admonition of the Lord and that's according to his word hey man you keep reminding them of God you keep reminding them of the word and point them to the word amen highlighting the highlighting to them and let him know hey men that heaven and earth pass away by the earth what the word will never pass away hey man and God is creating a new evident a newer amen - they're going to focus as well on the natural because I'll tell you there's a lot of there to distract our our young people there's a lot a there to distract mom and dad there's a lot of there to distract even Grandma and Grandpa that is the absolute truth because the Devils are there to try to get us all out of the will of God amen and yet at the same time get us to think we are in his will amen when we were out of his will hey man God had mercy on his brother and Elvis said by the Word of God that will find the will of God and we're going to live the will of God by the grace of God amen faith is they give a say the faith is a revelation of the will of God amen so let's get into the revelation of their will of God remember they want my faith in Hebrews there they did this they did that and everything when it comes to what they did by faith amen it says faith is the substance of things old for and it is the evidence of things not seen it is substance and evidence so what my faith declares is more real than what my senses declare a man because he said by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which to appear and it goes on down by faith able by faith a man he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which now listen you get a blessing what is the blessing that Abel got Amen god responding to a bizarre sacrifice and it says he offered under God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain a man by which he obtained witness that he was righteous a man your righteousness is being in his in the will of God Amen hallelujah the righteousness of God is its provoked / provoked promoted rather to those who are going by the faith of God and the will of God oh my are you in the will of God it's like the problem of God said if you're working in a job and he said his position came up a new position higher more pay and he said and there was two of you he said qualified are you gonna claim that position he said no it not if you're a Christian where's the will of God each if you're a Christian you'll step back and you'll say no I won't take it give it to the over Oh somebody else will come as they're old but you're gonna get a higher position you're gonna get more money you're gonna get this you're gonna get that and some people Oh make no wonder the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil yeah at the I'm more interested in money than they are in the word the will of God yeah god help us burn just think that you will go to hell because one same spirit the rich man this is amazing amen Jesus so much a guy gave to the poor well that struck his heart to show that he wasn't in the will of God oh he was by the letter of the word jesus said do this do this do this do this always I've kept those ceases from my youth up what we couldn't say that no way and Jesus said yet one thing thou lackest for iriarte the most Sunda load of hey man do you like anything well like I said they said all what must I do he called Jesus good and Jesus said there's one good but God none good but God yeah he was God but the rich he said this is what you gotta do you know why you know why Jesus gave him that command he knew that's where his weakness was a man not the little God it was doing what's right in his own eyes and the prophet of God told him you gotta sell all you got give to the poor in the way not many gonna do that but the Bible says he lifted up his eyes in hell brother if you put more inches on some natural things than you do on the spiritual and it hinders it hinders God in your life it endures the leadership of God in your life God wants you to do this do this do this and you enter that you go to hell you know why cuz God's gonna bring out the real spirit that's controlling you if he's in your heart not my will father don't be done the will of God if he's in your heart you're giving pre a message to the will of God that's right and brother again that's why Jesus said the love of money is the root of all evil he beloved could money money money money money governments are wanting it and people are wanting it everything but don't worry about because you're gonna lose it in here oh yeah they're gonna take everything I thought I told that fellow one time he was working at a certain place and I said one time one these days I said you know you come here and you won't get no paycheck I said I'll give you I said you'll be everybody be given a card that's all you do you know you know where all those cards are leading and they're increasing more and more or more well I've seen people the stores open to open up their wallets and gonna pay for something by the card and they go through this and wife good grief I should wear in the world to get all them cards that's insanity the world's not only a germ warfare but the world's insane and it is and and eventually they'll narrow it down to one card 666 and you'll be able to go to the store you'll be allowed to get so much and does he have to go here and get this boy here get that there's you mean the world's coming to that place oh yes it's not far far it's not far from me it's a warning please let's start exercising faith anybody this exercise faith trusting garment this exercise faith they manage sir we will leave everything with the Lord he meant the will of God by the grace of God amen so Abel Abel attained the witness that he was righteous a man just testifying why God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now God testifying of his gifts he's like the brother that brother round caught at one time that how they God testify of tables get he said fire came down from heaven and devoured it amen he said God acknowledging Abel's faith a man a man a man so brothers sister goes on by faith by faith by faith and look what a but look what Abraham did was it a Moses you know nobody sacrificed oh but today we want everything to work good we don't want to be tested and trying just everything worked good I got to do this because it's better I got to do that because I've got it what's the will of God it says by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter brother he chose the will of God amen choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God did too then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season are we choosing to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a while and then well then we'll go to go to the will of God no you choose the will of God now as I said a lot of so-called smelly really gonna be very uncomfortable in glory in heaven if they had knowledge of this world they would want to come back because there's more than more for them to enjoy in this world then over there because they're doing they're dealing with their flesh Elvis we got the Holy Ghost brother the flesh is feeling worse and worse and worse and worse you want to get out of here get out of here I can't take it no longer Lord can't take you longer so he chose it he chose the will of God he chose to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season what is your choice today what will be your choice in an hour won't we be your choice after the service what will you be our choice tonight Grace and contours well will be your choice when you got to make a choice at work or in school you got to choose this Tuesday I got again for God's glory even in the school like I said that I attended denominational school they they acknowledge you you're religious they fell I was religious because I always brought the Lord into everything you know and there's like they acknowledge that like I said when that deep that teacher is still alive but very old now when he had that religious class and he asked the question no no when I went in and I was late he told me I was gonna be late for the judgement I said I hope so man and then he asked the question what church age are we in that was the Bible class and nobody answered so he asked it the second or third time and I answered oh oh he said you're right thank you amen sources anything religious did would come to me and you know what just think back then in 1967 I believe it was for 68 that he told me I was going to be a pastor yeah he told me I was going to be a pastor yeah thank so brother the Lord Muslims was speaking through a man I said well I said that's whatever the will of God is I said that's up to the Lord amen to the grace of God brother what is the will of God for your life what does God want you to do sometimes we base it on money how many's basing it on the will of God oh yeah all of that to be honest said I never did judge a job based on money but God blessed me as I went on yeah as I said I was a janitor and I worked in a store and just gathered up carts outside oh yeah did did that yeah did it did janitorial work and even the even the boss knew I was tired at one point there cuz I would I was on to go I'm to go I'm to go and he said look mr. Watson come here so he took me up into the storage area told me to go to sleep there under me in that department store he said light out there he said you need a rest why cuz I never took no breaks no no I don't understand that take a break I said like I told you before when they asked me why don't you take a break I said I'm not using their picking trouble I said I said sometimes I might use a pin not only walking around here I don't need the way Oh what he said not many think like that you're right brother grace amen the grace that were in the will of God by the grace of God turn with me to mark chapter three st. Mark's Gospel chapter three time is passing and verse 31 to show you the Word of God concerning the will of God and the importance of being in the will of God there came then his brethren and his mother and standing out set onto him calling him and the multitude said about him and they said unto Him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren and he looked around about on them which sat about him and said Behold my mother and my brethren that was the will of God was the will of God in your life amen who is your spiritual mother and your spiritual brothers and sisters they're more important to you than to the believers than your natural yeah if you're born again oh yeah you're attracted to your heavenly family amen the natural passes away and he said oh so ever shall do the will of God the same is my brother and my sister and mother amazing so who is your mother who is your brother who is your sister is they that do the will of God a man so you are my brothers sisters mother and your Center says father a man only those that do the will of God not oniy there's not many draw this line right there there's a number of believers today that are more caught up with their natural families than they are their spiritual Jesus got caught up with his spiritual not the natural even when he went back to Capernaum and his stepbrother who would call him they would say oh oh I'll come you you did that there did that there did that you you won't do nothing here he said because of your unbelief he rebuked him for their unbelief he was putting the emphasis on the spiritual sons and daughters of God they were his brothers and sisters and he told us if we're if we do this and walk in the light and say it obey his word we are his brothers and his sisters he we don't he won't stop to consider the Sirians of our relationship the significance of what we do identifies our relationship so whosoever shall do the will of God the same is my brother and my sister and my mother those that do the will of God for their lives and everyday living they are his brothers sister and mother amen turn with me to Romans chapter eight Romans chapter eight it says in verse 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and either search of the heart knowing what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God so when you pray in the spirit when you pray you got to pray in the spirit because the Spirit would make it a session according to the will of God for you and for your everyday living it's not what you feel you've got to do is what God wants you to do so he said he that search of the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit the Holy Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God a man Romans chapter 12 again the significance is based on the will of God Romans chapter 12 and verse 1 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice amen not just going to church but God wants to use you over there for something God wants you to do this God want you to do that amen present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable it's your reasonable service amen I think you were singing here concerning what Christ has done for you for us I've been mentioned in prayer but what Christ has done for us what ought we to do for him brother we consider what he's suffering and and today in this generation people avoid suffering they avoid suffering for the gospel sake they don't want to suffer for this brother for this sister no they do well I'll just leave it to them go on what does God wants you to do amen the Bible tells us that the week got a support strong the strong rather got us some more the weak yeah so are you supporting the weak are you there for your brother and sister are you praying for them do you love them amen love to the extent you can't forget him amen and he said so he said which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so you think you're in the will of God because you believe the message no he you're in the will of God wouldn't when he's in you and he and he's living is living the message out through you not talking it through your tongue living it through your life Amy you're separated unto the Lord for the resurrection in the rapture God's doing something see listen who was in the will of God when they came out of Egypt look all they saw what God didn't heed you surely they knew that God was able to destroy the enemy and in in the promised land but no no they they they were just caught up with themselves and they were fearful oh they just didn't believe amen they refused the will they wanted the will of God to come out of it you and face the Egyptians but they didn't want the will of God to go into the Promised Land oh I want the will of God to come out of here I want I don't want to be subbing through this and subject to that yeah and there's people commended nominations think they don't have to be subject to anybody it's like I said it at the altar one time when we were praying dead certain certain believers said oh thank you Lord for delivering us from the churches now we don't have to be snobby 20 men that was a lie of the devil become more subject because God has said in the church the five full ministry that they asked the prophet of God in the opening of the seven seals in questions than answers they said oh does the bride ever ministry yes he said the bride's got a ministry said and he says been there he says since since the day of Pentecost he said God has said in the church he sort of fivefold ministry and he listed them that was his answer to the question in the seals and wonders I quoted I believe the last service that he's the popular pastor the pastor he's as a judge he's judged by the word oh yeah he said even the Evangelist has got to have a pastor amazing grace of God brother let's prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God God is testing your subjection as I said if you're not something here you won't be something there oh yeah because there's gonna be there's gonna be a thought he's there they're gonna be subject father God has exhorted us he said if you're if you're here and you're subject you're all over over the people you'll be over to people there people don't realize that that's that's one place they think in heaven or we can do what we want to do know if anybody does everything decently and in order is God and I tell you heaven is in its decent and in order very bad that's right these are above these these are next below below the law there's also side the city oh we still got something to do as I said don't get the idea you're going to a dream world fairy tale a lot of ideas of having her dreams oh we won't have to do this we won't have to do that God is testing you and I'll tell you if he's testing anyone that's too bright because she got to sit with him and it's wrong so brother leaders prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God all right go to me with Ephesians chapter 6 I let her finish with the scriptures Ephesians chapter 6 amen and in verse 1 it says children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother and this is obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and ye father's provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord amen servants will be into the hem that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ not with eyeservice as men pleasers but as the servants of God oh Christ doing the will of God from the heart amen see it's the will of God now it's got to be from the heart it's expounded we're given the understanding of revelation of what the will of God is and where it is if you're born again the will of God is in the heart you're living out of your heart your attitude your spirit when you meet people you're doing the will of God there's a spirit comes out amen praise the Lord so he said doing the will of God from the heart and with good doing service as to the Lord and not to me okay you do to what God wants to do not what man wants to do a man turn with me again to the book of Hebrews chapter 6 I'm proving by the word what the Scriptures has to say concerning the will of God and the significance of the will of God and how that God wants you to walk in his will in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 36 and the Bible says others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings came over of bonds north eleven bonds and imprisonment where they suffered a lot but God of prevent permitted it so I'd be the will of God he wanted it to bring out their faith amen in 1036 for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise amen give me two patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise amen so brother the will of God is very significant amen now let's go to first Peter just a couple more scriptures first Peter chapter 4 and verse 14 first peter 4:14 if he be reproached for the name of Christ happy are you for the spirit of glory and of God rested upon you and on their party is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified they may but let none of you suffer as a murderer as a thief as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf for the time has come the judgment must begin at the house of God and if at first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel and the righteous scarcely be saved if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God we suffer suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him and well doing as unto a faithful creator amen if you're suffering according to the will of God commit your soul to him amen as on to a faithful creator amen judgment begins at the house of God - what to test those that are in the will of God or out of the will of God so are you in the will around don't go by your mind go by your heart amen first John chapter 2 familiar Scripture first John 2 and verse 15 love not the world amen neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world and it's referring to the ways of the world and and what the world is offering and so on If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever go back to the will of God again what is the will of God for you in this world amen what does God want you to think out as God wants you to walk talk and act and react amen according to the will of God praise the name of the Lord he that doeth the will of God abideth forever see the significance make sure you're in the will of God don't don't just assume it make your calling and election sure it make your call and election sure you got to make sure you're in the will of God know that your election is in the will of God amen your calling is in the will of God amen the prophet of God said I would rather have a church with 50 people in the will of God than to have five out of the will of God sure God can do more with a man in his will in one hour than he could with a man out of his will in 50 years he is stumbling and staggering like shooting in the dark but when man is really in the will of God and knows his calling he should abide there amen Jesus on his way up the devil always doubted that being any more than a prophet he didn't believe that he was Emanuel how could God the Creator ever stand and that somebody tell him if you be the Son of God command the stones to be turned to bread how could he in pilots courtyard and there he was with a rag around his face the Roman soldiers spitting in his face jerking on the beard and the blood pouring through with a crown of thorns on his head and his blood running freely down his side and Satan watching that and Satan said that can't be the Son of God it just can't be he wouldn't put up with that but he put up with it for you and me now we're we willing to suffer for him as he suffered for us he said but the sons of God put up with anything as long as they know they're doing the will of God and that's what he come to that's what every genuine believer has to do separate yourself from doubters and unbelievers and walk with Christ it's life to you and Abraham did such a thing in 25 years later we find him still believing the promise he had focused his mind to the will of God by the Word of God and believed it and if we can focus ourselves to the plan of God to what God wants us to do and what God promised us he's to let everything else alone he said no matter how long it is just keep believing just thing abran waited 25 years for the child and Mort longer he waited physically the more impossible it seemed amen God was letting to go let it go let it go until it would be America and God allows things in your life your life and I and brothers and sisters from life until what until there's prune that your life is a miracle yeah you wouldn't bill do it without the will of God amen working out the miracle of Christ in you amen he said Paul could not go to a certain places that he wanted because the Spirit forbade him remember many times that Paul was trying to go some place thinking there is where I could have a great meeting but the Spirit forbid him now he said does that clearly state and prove that Paul was a prisoner to Jesus Christ he was harassed to his word by the spirit he so I like that and he we feel well oh we got to be a witness we got to go here we got to go there we got to do this got it no you got to be led by the spirit what does God want you to go there this guy wants to do this because the prophet of God said we're not going to reach everyone with this message he said only the elect but with the bit with the the basics of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ the world will receive that witness and it is I've already brought that out concerning and that just not only Internet television and radios and all that stuff and but it's in Madonna love magazines going around the world amazing absolutely amazing and it's only again the last couple of weeks I saw two or three other magazines and they're they're famous magazines but again it's they're focusing on spiritual something spiritual to them this religious foster spirit what is it it's a witness to the world the whole world got to receive that witness but when it comes to the message that's just for the bright for the resurrection and the rapture amen and it says Paul was bound by a chain and by fetters of love to do the will of God and that only regardless of our green the pastor was here on this side or that site he had to go the way the leader and the yoke went Oh tonight if we as Brenham Tabernacle could only become prisoners to our own selfish being to our own ambition and we could completely surrender ourselves and be yoked to Christ no matter what the rest of the world thinks no matter what the rest of the world does we are yoked with fetters of love we are prisoners to Christ amen and the will of God is usually contrary to our will amen god help us that we're going to seek the will get in the will no matter what no matter what it's for don't you it don't you make the decision find God's will as I said there's many today in different parts of the world and they shouldn't be her out of the will of God you know and it's like a missionary one time he said to a lot of the preachers in America he said please he said dose it don't send any American evangelists he said I think at the time he was in Africa or somewhere like that he said don't send any American evangelists please he said there just couldn't lead the people astray because what he was experiencing and he was not African but he was in Africa but what he was experiencing was a lot of things that was contrary to the word country to the message yeah and they were there to promote their own ministries but not what God was doing not the will of God there will a men so he said please you American Eve and just stay home so brother and I get a lot of emails sometimes for this for this for this for this for this and just I got it one again yesterday someone asked another question would you please explain this question not yesterday it was last week this is what about this ministry I said well brother I cannot condone that ministry I'm sorry I said 30 years ago I said we have problems with that ministry so please in the name of Jesus don't submit yourself to that ministry and and that was the brother was from Africa but the minute the ministry is referring to was not an African ministry it was from another Western type ministry so brother caught helpless again straight us away gate narrow is the way and do there be that find it why again it's the scripture fulfilled he said there's gonna be such going on in the last days that he said would deceive the very elect impossible now brother sister if it's that bad you should be on our guard and we should make sure were in the will of God we are doing what God wants us to do when he wants us to do where he wants us to do the will of God he's what matters not my real father dying to be done brother I could even go through the scriptures even the Old Testament and prove where this one got out of the will of God that one got out of the will of God you know maybe only once but God had to go after him and bring him back into his will because they did when God reveals his will the devil is there to get you out of it a man oh yeah just just constantly I thought so even even now a number a number of number of prophets in the Old Testament they just just one thing they got had the will of God you know we got to stay in the will of God then the brother and one prophet not out of the will of God and it cost him his life he didn't cost him his Redemption or his salvation but it cost him his life on her Tod cut it off now there's a number there like that and you come on down even - even into the New Testament again there are those that got out of the will of God now even down to this hour there are many that are out of the will of God amen because they're doing what's right in their own eyes grace god bless you to stay you make your call unless you're sure again well now you know to make my called an election sure I gotta make sure
