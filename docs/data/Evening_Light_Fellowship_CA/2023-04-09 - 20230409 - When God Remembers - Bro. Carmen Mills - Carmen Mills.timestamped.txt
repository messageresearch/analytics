[47:24] tonight if you're expecting the prophet
[47:26] said you get what you expect
[47:28] if you're not expecting much you won't
[47:30] get much
[47:32] but I believe the Lord is here once
[47:33] again as he I'm sure every service he's
[47:36] here to speak if you're here to listen
[47:39] man I believe he can speak personally
[47:40] I've I've seen it happen different times
[47:42] in my Ministry brother Timothy mentioned
[47:45] it as well and just the Lord is able to
[47:48] speak personally
[47:50] I've seen that happen so many times the
[47:52] Bible says the word is a discerner
[47:54] you know we think about the profit and
[47:56] I've had that too I wish maybe I could
[47:59] go you know when I'm in trouble I I wish
[48:01] brother Brandon was here I'd go and he'd
[48:03] see a vision but you don't need that
[48:05] the word is a discerner if you ever need
[48:07] tonight he can speak personally to you
[48:12] it's personally to your need
[48:14] if you're willing to listen amen let us
[48:16] pray together Lord Jesus we come to you
[48:18] tonight we thank you for your presence
[48:20] among us we know you're already here
[48:23] and Lord we come to this part of the
[48:24] service
[48:25] Lord we I have nothing to offer these
[48:28] people Lord
[48:29] and Lord I all that I want to do is
[48:32] yield this vessel to you
[48:34] I don't want to say one word of my own
[48:36] thinking Lord
[48:37] but I pray that you would speak through
[48:39] me you know these people Lord you know
[48:41] the needs that might be among them you
[48:43] know where a word might be needed Lord
[48:46] and I pray that you would allow us to
[48:48] say those things that would be helpful
[48:51] that would be edifying Lord to your
[48:53] people tonight we pray we just commit
[48:55] this part of the service to you now For
[48:57] Your Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's
[49:00] name we pray
[49:01] amen
[49:03] we'll have you turn to the the
[49:05] scriptures I don't want to keep you
[49:06] standing to Genesis 19.
[49:09] Genesis 19.
[49:12] read beginning from the 27th verse
[49:21] through to the 29th verse
[49:24] and Abraham got up early in the morning
[49:27] to the place where he stood before the
[49:30] Lord
[49:31] and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah
[49:34] and behold all the land of the plain
[49:36] and be held and lo the smoke of the
[49:38] country went up as a smoke of a furnace
[49:41] and it came to pass when God destroyed
[49:43] the cities of the plain that God
[49:45] remembered Abraham and sent lot out of
[49:48] the midst of the overthrow when he
[49:50] overthrew the cities in the witch lot
[49:52] dwelt
[49:53] may be seated
[49:56] before I before I speak on on what the
[50:00] Lord's put on my heart tonight there was
[50:01] I was listening as I was coming up here
[50:03] I was in New Orleans here for for work
[50:05] and I and I drove up today which is a
[50:08] little bit of a drive and so I had the
[50:10] opportunity to listen to a message and
[50:13] and the message I listened to was I
[50:15] stand at the door and knock
[50:16] and in there brother Branham
[50:18] you know gives the example and he uses
[50:20] it in many places he talks about
[50:23] he said if I was hungry and somebody
[50:24] gave me 25 cents he said you know I
[50:27] could be just as happy with that as with
[50:29] the bread that I need
[50:32] but in this message he he went on in a
[50:34] little bit more detail because and I
[50:36] think it's something that maybe we miss
[50:40] so the purchase power is is is
[50:41] equivalent to the faith that we that we
[50:44] get when we you know that's the piece
[50:46] but but the but the prophet preached
[50:49] another message that said tested Faith
[50:50] produces goods and we're maybe not
[50:53] accustomed to the fact that many times
[50:55] God tests us a little bit with our faith
[50:57] because you don't need faith if your
[50:59] need is met if God comes tonight and you
[51:02] reach out and you you get an instant
[51:04] healing an instant answer well there's
[51:06] no faith being exercised too much there
[51:08] but but the faith is what stands there
[51:10] in the place of the thing that you hope
[51:12] for that's what the Bible says it's an
[51:14] actual substance and so and so brother
[51:16] Brandon said I'm just as good with this
[51:18] 25 cents in my hand but I want you to
[51:21] notice some things he said that really
[51:23] kind of struck me he said he said I get
[51:25] this 25 cents and he said I go down the
[51:27] street
[51:28] and you said I cross over the river and
[51:30] I go through the Briar Patch so you know
[51:33] he doesn't get the bread rate off
[51:35] doesn't happen overnight sometimes
[51:38] he said I'm getting hungrier I'm getting
[51:40] hungrier all the time he said I haven't
[51:42] got the bread yet but all the time I'm
[51:44] going I'm rejoicing
[51:47] because I've got the purchase power but
[51:50] not just the purchase power brother
[51:51] Brenham said but the assurance that the
[51:54] bread belongs to me
[51:57] and that's the thing the devil I think
[51:59] gets a lot of us out is is we believe
[52:01] that God can do it
[52:03] we believe God can heal us we believe
[52:05] God can deliver us we believe God can
[52:07] save our loved ones he can do it
[52:09] but you got to go from the can to the
[52:11] will
[52:12] that God will do it that it's mine
[52:16] it's not just possible but that it's
[52:17] going to happen
[52:18] and that's where the faith comes in so
[52:21] he said he said I've got to purchase
[52:22] power and the assurance that the bread
[52:24] belongs to me
[52:25] and he goes on he said before I get
[52:28] there he said I might have cramps
[52:30] I'm so hungry
[52:32] so I might have cramps I I might get
[52:35] Delirious he said Till I'm fighting my
[52:37] way through the bushes like a madman
[52:40] he said I could get like that that's how
[52:42] bad it could get but as long as I'm
[52:44] holding the 25 cents
[52:47] he said the bread has got to come
[52:49] it has got to come
[52:51] so what is the devil doing when you get
[52:54] that faith in a service that the Lord is
[52:56] going to meet your need now the devil's
[52:58] trying to get you to lose that 25 cents
[53:00] you've got it in your hand but he's
[53:01] trying to knock it out of your hand
[53:05] about a year ago into the story for
[53:07] another day but I was running I run a
[53:09] little bit for exercise and I was going
[53:10] across the road street with a follow I
[53:13] was ahead of him and this lady was
[53:15] coming in a car I thought she saw me but
[53:18] she didn't and she was traveling fairly
[53:19] quickly and I got hit and thrown about
[53:21] 20 feet in the air but I had pulled my
[53:24] phone out because I was near the end of
[53:25] my run and it and it knocked the phone
[53:27] out of my hand but I didn't actually
[53:29] know it did and if it wasn't for the
[53:31] fellow that was there I wouldn't have
[53:33] even got it back probably I wasn't even
[53:36] looking for it because of the
[53:37] distraction
[53:38] so you're you're claiming something you
[53:40] got the 25 cents
[53:42] you're claiming something then the Devil
[53:43] comes along with something else and he
[53:45] tries to get you to let go
[53:47] of that Faith you got
[53:49] but you've got to hold on to that for
[53:50] dear life because that is your Assurance
[53:53] of your victory of whatever it is that
[53:55] you're claiming
[53:57] because God will come through he will
[54:00] he'll come through he'll bring it to
[54:02] pass but we can't prescribe when
[54:05] Prophet said we can't say we can't tell
[54:07] God when he will answer but we can't
[54:09] prescribe when it's going to be
[54:12] now I want to go to my thought I want to
[54:14] speak on the thought of
[54:15] when God remembers
[54:18] when God remembers
[54:20] now God we know
[54:22] the Bible says God he doesn't look like
[54:25] us the Bible says we have never seen God
[54:26] no man has seen God at any time he
[54:29] dwells in another dimension Prophet said
[54:31] he dwells in a place he's a being he
[54:34] dwells in a place but we don't know what
[54:36] he looks like you know he's in that
[54:38] realm that other dimension that we can't
[54:40] see but we know that he can come to this
[54:42] one whenever he chooses to and declare
[54:44] himself
[54:45] but we do notice also in the scripture
[54:47] because God wants to be personal with us
[54:49] that throughout the scriptures we see
[54:52] the Bible describe him with these
[54:56] personal attributes he personifies many
[54:58] of his attributes so we read about God
[55:00] hearing we read about God speaking
[55:03] and and touching and all these things
[55:05] that are human attributes but we see God
[55:08] expressing those and we also read and
[55:11] can see where it speaks about God's mind
[55:14] and about God's memory and about God
[55:17] remembering is where we're coming to but
[55:19] of course God's memory is not like our
[55:21] memory our memory is is not good many
[55:24] times
[55:25] you know it is said that every
[55:26] experience we ever have that that those
[55:28] thoughts and those experiences are all
[55:30] there in our mind
[55:32] our trouble is bringing those memories
[55:34] and those thoughts to the Forefront
[55:37] sometimes it takes a trigger I was
[55:39] somewhere one time many years ago and
[55:40] and I smelt a certain smell and when I
[55:44] smelt that it took me back to when I was
[55:47] in elementary school when my mother used
[55:50] to pack me a lunch in this particular I
[55:52] had a lunch box a yellow lunch box that
[55:54] flipped open I had a service on one side
[55:55] my lunch in the other and she used to
[55:57] tape a dime or 15 cents in the top I'd
[56:00] used to buy milk and all of a sudden
[56:01] that memory which I probably hadn't
[56:04] thought about maybe since then come
[56:06] flooding back just from that trigger
[56:09] but God doesn't need a trigger for his
[56:12] memory because he knows everything that
[56:14] has ever happened or ever will happen
[56:17] but God does remember and and but his
[56:21] his remembrance if you take the
[56:22] definition of remember it just simply
[56:24] means to call to mind
[56:26] and with God he can call to mind any
[56:28] thought at any time
[56:30] and so every promise that God has ever
[56:32] made in the scriptures he has not
[56:33] forgotten it but there's a time when he
[56:36] will bring that thought forward he will
[56:38] remember it it could be triggered by
[56:41] something that we do or it could be just
[56:42] something he does and we want to look at
[56:44] a few examples in the scripture just to
[56:46] build some background for this thought
[56:49] I want to look at Noah first of all
[56:52] we all know the story of Noah how that
[56:54] he was called out that God was going to
[56:56] send a judgment upon the earth a flood
[56:58] of waters he understood that he believed
[57:00] that he preached the message he built an
[57:03] ark and then there was a day that came
[57:05] when God sent the animals in and told
[57:07] Noah it's your turn now to go in the ark
[57:10] and he closes the door I want to look at
[57:13] this timeline there's many descriptions
[57:15] of how the timing of this went I'm just
[57:17] taking one of them they're all fairly
[57:19] close but we know that he went in the
[57:21] ark and he was there for seven days
[57:22] first of all nothing happened no rain
[57:25] brother Bram talks about that I'm not
[57:28] going to take that time so he's there
[57:29] for seven days then the rain begins
[57:32] and it rains for 40 days and 40 nights
[57:34] so now he's in the ARK for 47 days now
[57:36] the purpose of this flood is Noah
[57:38] understands it is to destroy all flesh
[57:42] that breathe the breath
[57:44] well after that 47 days maybe add a
[57:46] couple days if you want pretty much
[57:49] everything was gone then the work was
[57:52] accomplished
[57:53] and and it doesn't say much about what
[57:55] Noah thought but if I was Noah sitting
[57:58] in the yard with what I understood about
[58:00] things I'd be kind of thinking it was
[58:02] soon time to get out
[58:04] you know because the work is done why am
[58:07] I still here
[58:08] but yet we know that the flood covered
[58:10] the Earth
[58:11] for another 150 days after that so now
[58:14] we're up to 197 days why
[58:17] and and I I can't imagine that Noah
[58:19] wouldn't have thought that in his mind
[58:21] you know why is God waiting why is God
[58:24] delaying you know taking me out and
[58:27] maybe somebody has an answer but we know
[58:28] that many times we go through things in
[58:31] life for which the answer escapes us
[58:33] we don't know why
[58:35] it happens
[58:37] and the why question is not wrong it's
[58:39] just the it's the attitude with which we
[58:41] we have it but but wondering why is
[58:44] normal
[58:45] it's normal
[58:46] you remember Gideon in the Bible
[58:49] Gideon was there a faithful man a
[58:52] Believer but but you know he was under
[58:54] the pressure of the enemy all the time
[58:56] and this man this Angel of the Lord
[58:59] comes to Gideon and you remember what he
[59:01] says to him he says you know you you are
[59:03] he calls him a mighty man of Valor
[59:07] now Gideon I'm sure Gideon was just
[59:10] scratching his head over that because
[59:12] how on Earth is that possible
[59:14] I'm a mighty man of Valor and I'm being
[59:16] I'm being overrun by these by this enemy
[59:19] of Israel
[59:20] and and yet he was because God sees you
[59:24] and he sees me differently than we see
[59:27] ourselves
[59:29] because we see our faults and we see our
[59:31] failures and we fail every day brother
[59:33] Brown said we fail every day and so
[59:35] those failures the enemy loves to bring
[59:37] them up he loves to condemn us because
[59:40] of them and and that and that dwelling
[59:43] on those things hinders our faith many
[59:45] times because we think well God's not
[59:47] going to answer my prayer because I'm
[59:48] such a failure
[59:49] but that's not true and that's not the
[59:51] way God sees you
[59:53] but Gideon asked you know asked why
[59:57] and even Jesus
[59:58] you know on the cross Jesus was on the
[1:00:01] cross there
[1:00:03] and we know the weight of the sins
[1:00:04] coming upon his shoulders and as that
[1:00:06] takes place we know that the the father
[1:00:08] whose presence he's always felt his
[1:00:10] whole life
[1:00:11] and now in his darkest time sometimes
[1:00:14] that's the way it seems in your darkest
[1:00:15] trial when you're looking for God it's
[1:00:17] when he seems to vanish
[1:00:20] and so he feels the presence of the
[1:00:22] father pulling away and he cries out he
[1:00:25] says my God my God why
[1:00:27] why
[1:00:28] have you forsaken me why
[1:00:31] and so the why question is not the
[1:00:33] problem
[1:00:34] but remember God never goes far even if
[1:00:37] he seems away remember Job in the Bible
[1:00:39] in his trial in his deep trial he went
[1:00:43] looking for God you read the scripture I
[1:00:45] look forward
[1:00:46] I can't find him I look backward I
[1:00:48] looked left and I look to the right he's
[1:00:49] not there in fact he even said he even
[1:00:51] acknowledged that God was hiding himself
[1:00:54] he was hiding himself
[1:00:56] but he had a revelation which we all
[1:00:58] need to have that even if you can't see
[1:01:00] God he can always see you
[1:01:04] job said he knew that the Lord knows the
[1:01:06] way that I take he said
[1:01:08] he knows where you are there's no pit
[1:01:10] that's so black
[1:01:11] that God's eyes can't Pierce down into
[1:01:13] it
[1:01:14] there's no place you can be where God
[1:01:16] doesn't see where you are
[1:01:19] and so Noah is in the ARK for all this
[1:01:21] time 150 197 days now
[1:01:24] but then we come to Genesis 8 and 1.
[1:01:27] and in Genesis 8 1 we don't see any
[1:01:30] trigger for this we don't see somebody
[1:01:32] praying or crying out we're going to see
[1:01:33] some examples of that but in this case
[1:01:36] the Bible just simply says and God
[1:01:38] remembered Noah
[1:01:41] but God had never forgotten no it's not
[1:01:43] because he forgot about him but it was
[1:01:45] time now and when God when God remembers
[1:01:48] it's because he's about to do something
[1:01:50] he's about to act
[1:01:52] the Bible says God remember no every
[1:01:54] living thing and all the cattle that was
[1:01:56] with him in the ark and God made a wind
[1:01:58] to pass over the earth and the waters
[1:02:01] assuaged
[1:02:03] but now you look at that and Noah
[1:02:05] probably recognized he probably heard
[1:02:06] the win and thought now God is doing
[1:02:08] something I'm going to get out of here
[1:02:10] soon
[1:02:11] but you know
[1:02:13] he was there
[1:02:14] for a while another 74 days
[1:02:18] a God could have dried those Waters up
[1:02:20] in a day
[1:02:22] but 74 days he's there the wind's
[1:02:24] blowing he hears it and all of a sudden
[1:02:27] as after after 74 days they can see the
[1:02:30] tops of the mountains so we're getting
[1:02:31] there
[1:02:32] but then there's another 40 Days Noah
[1:02:35] sends out the Raven and the Dove and so
[1:02:37] on and then there's another 14 days
[1:02:39] after that and finally the dry land
[1:02:41] appears and so now you think okay
[1:02:44] everything's done it's all dried up
[1:02:46] let's go nope he's there for another 57
[1:02:49] days
[1:02:50] for a total of 382 days over a year
[1:02:54] no one knew that God was the one that
[1:02:57] put him in there
[1:02:58] he was waiting for the god to say it's
[1:03:00] time to get out
[1:03:02] he was faithful and we have to be too
[1:03:05] and so so God linger sometimes
[1:03:08] sometimes he allows us to go through
[1:03:10] things but we have to hold on to that 25
[1:03:12] cents we have to hold on to that faith
[1:03:15] God will remember us
[1:03:18] he will remember us he hasn't forgotten
[1:03:20] us and that memory will come at some
[1:03:21] point to mind and then he'll begin to
[1:03:24] act on our behalf
[1:03:27] the Bible says in the Book of Psalms
[1:03:29] that many are the afflictions of the
[1:03:31] righteous and that word afflictions
[1:03:33] means hardships or perplexing
[1:03:35] circumstances it's not just sicknesses
[1:03:38] it could be anything
[1:03:39] many are the afflictions of the
[1:03:41] righteous we're not talking about the
[1:03:42] world they have their troubles but the
[1:03:44] righteous have all these problems and
[1:03:45] there are many of them
[1:03:47] so so that shouldn't surprise us that we
[1:03:49] have many it's not because we're bad
[1:03:50] it's not because we're failures yes
[1:03:52] sometimes we bring trouble on ourselves
[1:03:54] but even if we aren't if we're doing the
[1:03:57] best we can the devil brings lots our
[1:03:59] way
[1:04:00] but we have a promise the Lord
[1:04:01] delivereths us out of them all
[1:04:04] there's not one circumstance there's not
[1:04:07] one trial that you will ever face that
[1:04:09] God will not bring you out of
[1:04:12] he will
[1:04:16] now there is something unique about the
[1:04:17] memory of God in the mind of God we said
[1:04:19] God's memory is perfect and all of that
[1:04:21] it's not like ours but he has this other
[1:04:24] unique ability
[1:04:26] and that is God is capable and able to
[1:04:30] forget a memory
[1:04:33] the Bible speaks in Micah about the Sea
[1:04:35] of God's forgetfulness but I want to
[1:04:37] read this quote because brother Branham
[1:04:38] really states that well in the message
[1:04:40] Investments he said when your sins are
[1:04:42] confessed
[1:04:43] and your sins are dropped into the
[1:04:45] bleach of the blood of the son of God
[1:04:48] he said it remits sin so much
[1:04:51] it's put in the sea of God's
[1:04:52] forgetfulness notice this now
[1:04:55] it can never be remembered in his sight
[1:04:58] anymore
[1:05:00] we remember that's the problem that's
[1:05:02] the problem with our memories we
[1:05:03] remember things that we should be
[1:05:04] forgetting
[1:05:05] and we forget the things we should be
[1:05:07] remembering
[1:05:09] but God's able to actually forget it
[1:05:11] completely it's gone and so that's why
[1:05:14] you have to be so careful you know when
[1:05:16] a brother and sister accuses another
[1:05:19] you know if somebody's put us in under
[1:05:21] the blood and it's truly been put under
[1:05:22] the blood and it's forgotten from God
[1:05:24] and you're accusing them what do you
[1:05:26] think God thinks about that
[1:05:28] he doesn't even know what you're
[1:05:29] speaking of you are falsely accusing
[1:05:32] your brother or your sister
[1:05:34] if you take that in the the real truth
[1:05:36] of it before God if it's been put under
[1:05:39] the blood
[1:05:41] it can never be remembered in his sight
[1:05:43] and he said then what does that make a
[1:05:45] man he said a son of God
[1:05:47] God he notices he said God never
[1:05:49] remembers you to be a sinner imagine we
[1:05:53] remember that though and that's what
[1:05:54] that's what a lot of our trouble is
[1:05:56] we remember those mistakes but God
[1:05:59] doesn't remember them if we've confessed
[1:06:00] them
[1:06:01] he said he doesn't remember you are as a
[1:06:03] sinner you are a son you are a daughter
[1:06:05] he said there's no more remembrance of
[1:06:07] sin at all none
[1:06:10] he puts it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:06:11] the bleach the sea of forgetfulness
[1:06:13] brother Brown said is Christ's blood
[1:06:15] that we shed for you
[1:06:17] and therefore he said then you and you
[1:06:19] and God are Father and Son by Jesus
[1:06:22] Christ Grace not by anything you've done
[1:06:24] but by his grace
[1:06:28] but you know we we think of those things
[1:06:30] and we hang on to those things and and
[1:06:32] we remember them and sometimes we
[1:06:34] remember other people's sins too as I
[1:06:36] just said
[1:06:37] sometimes we have trouble with that if
[1:06:40] we've been hurt sometimes we have
[1:06:41] trouble to forgive we were brother
[1:06:44] Timothy might remember that when we were
[1:06:45] in Israel we went to this glass Art
[1:06:47] Museum I remembered we went into this
[1:06:49] room
[1:06:50] real dark lit room and they had this
[1:06:52] sculpture there with these
[1:06:54] faces on it the kind of blood and it was
[1:06:56] just a gory looking thing and it was a
[1:06:59] memory of the Holocaust and the lady
[1:07:01] that was that was touring us there she
[1:07:04] said you know this here is so that we
[1:07:07] will never forget
[1:07:09] and that we will never forgive I
[1:07:11] remember all of us yeah you know the
[1:07:13] people in the room just gasped because
[1:07:14] that's not the way a Christian is but
[1:07:17] that was her attitude they were still
[1:07:18] harboring that from all of those years
[1:07:21] and it wouldn't be easy if it was you
[1:07:24] and your family maybe she had relatives
[1:07:26] you know that that died you know it's
[1:07:29] possible but she said it's here so we
[1:07:31] don't forget and we don't forgive
[1:07:35] but you have got to forgive
[1:07:37] you might not be able to forget that's
[1:07:39] just a limitation of these minds but
[1:07:41] you've got to forgive
[1:07:43] you've got to forgive
[1:07:46] so it's it's different you know God
[1:07:48] thinks differently in that respect but
[1:07:50] it's important to remember that so when
[1:07:51] we're approaching God if we put these
[1:07:53] things under the blood we we can tell
[1:07:55] the Devil he's a liar when he comes at
[1:07:57] us with these things
[1:07:59] because God doesn't know about them
[1:08:00] they're they're not on your record you
[1:08:03] say well you know is there going to
[1:08:04] brother Brandon said when you do wrong
[1:08:06] you know you're going to get a weapon
[1:08:07] for it but that's not your problem
[1:08:09] that's gone he'll do that and we all
[1:08:11] know that we do wrong things we're going
[1:08:13] to get a weapon for it but that's all it
[1:08:15] is
[1:08:16] God does that and then you keep going on
[1:08:18] brother Brad said you go on you confess
[1:08:20] that thing and you go on and you rejoice
[1:08:22] with a Hallelujah on your heart you
[1:08:24] don't have to live under condemnation
[1:08:26] you don't have to do that because you
[1:08:28] feel like you have to punish yourself
[1:08:29] you don't have to do that God takes care
[1:08:32] of whatever needs to be done you are
[1:08:34] part is just to put that thing by
[1:08:36] confession under the blood
[1:08:39] I want to talk about Rachel
[1:08:40] in the Bible another character who you
[1:08:44] know Jacob saw her at the well and the
[1:08:46] and he loved her and wanted to marry her
[1:08:48] and he served for seven years and then
[1:08:50] was tricked into taking Leah and then
[1:08:54] another seven years he served for Rachel
[1:08:55] well
[1:08:57] God noticed and it's in the it's in I'm
[1:08:59] just going to read a few uh selected
[1:09:01] verses in Genesis 29 and verse 31 that
[1:09:04] God noticed that Leah was the Bible says
[1:09:08] hated but really it's that Leah wasn't
[1:09:10] really loved
[1:09:12] by Jacob and so the Bible says he opened
[1:09:16] Leah's womb because of that he opened
[1:09:17] Leah's womb
[1:09:19] but Rachel was barren
[1:09:21] now if you would take it from the
[1:09:23] perspective of Rachel
[1:09:24] Rachel could not help that she was born
[1:09:27] more fair than Leah Rachel could not
[1:09:30] help that Jacob loved her more than he
[1:09:33] loved Leah wasn't her fault it was the
[1:09:36] way God made her
[1:09:37] so it's like she's being punished and so
[1:09:41] she's she's Desiring to have children
[1:09:45] and uh you know uh well in fact neither
[1:09:49] wife was very happy because Leah I don't
[1:09:52] think Leah was too concerned about
[1:09:53] children as she was she wanted Jacob's
[1:09:55] love you can see that in the scriptures
[1:09:57] he wanted Jacob's Lobster so she was
[1:09:59] having children thinking and in fact
[1:10:01] even in one of the verses it'll say
[1:10:03] after she had a child now he will love
[1:10:06] me and it was like that was the only
[1:10:08] reason she was having but but Rachel
[1:10:09] Moore wanted the children so that
[1:10:11] neither wife was very happy
[1:10:13] and Rachel at one point tells Jacob you
[1:10:15] know give me children unless I die
[1:10:17] what could he do about it he wasn't the
[1:10:19] one that closed her womb
[1:10:21] but just I want to just go through
[1:10:23] quickly these of course from these
[1:10:26] children come the patriarch these are
[1:10:28] the Patriarchs
[1:10:30] so Leah has has four children one right
[1:10:34] after the other the first four
[1:10:36] Patriarchs
[1:10:38] and Rachel's still Baron
[1:10:41] and then as we as we go through we see
[1:10:43] Rachel has this idea well I can't have
[1:10:45] children I'm going to offer my maid and
[1:10:47] so she offers her maid Bill and to Jacob
[1:10:50] and he has a son by her which was Dan he
[1:10:53] was the fifth patriarch and then a
[1:10:55] second son napped a lie which was the
[1:10:57] sixth patriarch
[1:10:59] well Leah didn't want to be left out so
[1:11:00] she offers her maid because at this
[1:11:02] point Leah had stopped conceiving
[1:11:05] and so she offers her maid and they have
[1:11:08] two more children zilpa she has Gad and
[1:11:11] then Asher's son's seven and eight now
[1:11:13] we've got eight Patriarchs Rachel still
[1:11:15] hasn't had any children of her own then
[1:11:17] the Lord opens Leah's womb again
[1:11:20] and she Bears her fifth son is a car the
[1:11:23] ninth patriarch she Bears a sixth son
[1:11:24] zebulun which became the 10th patriarch
[1:11:28] now we know there's only two more coming
[1:11:30] and this happened over a period of years
[1:11:32] so if you think about from the time that
[1:11:34] Jacob met Rachel it was 14 years before
[1:11:36] they even got married and depending on
[1:11:38] who you you read the scholars say it
[1:11:40] could have been almost that much time
[1:11:41] again
[1:11:42] before we come to Genesis 30 and 22
[1:11:46] because in all of this time I know she
[1:11:48] we see in the scripture where she was
[1:11:51] after Jacob you know but I believe that
[1:11:52] Rachel sought the Lord as well that God
[1:11:55] would open her womb because the Bible
[1:11:57] says in Genesis 30 and 22 it says and
[1:12:01] God remembered Rachel
[1:12:04] and God hearkened to her and opened her
[1:12:07] womb
[1:12:09] but it was years it was years that it
[1:12:11] took how many times would Rachel have
[1:12:14] asked God how many times has she had
[1:12:15] treated him to to open her womb and then
[1:12:19] all of a sudden
[1:12:20] Gods remembers her not that he had
[1:12:23] forgotten it's not that he didn't know
[1:12:24] that she was asking but it was now time
[1:12:27] to bring that thought forward he always
[1:12:29] intended to open her womb and now the
[1:12:32] time had come
[1:12:33] and she opens her womb and of course she
[1:12:35] has Joseph and then Benjamin dies in
[1:12:38] childbirth and those are the those are
[1:12:39] the 12 Patriarchs but you know you can
[1:12:41] look and say well why was she made the
[1:12:43] wait so long and other people
[1:12:45] you know we see in the scripture they
[1:12:47] they prayed and they got an instant
[1:12:48] answer
[1:12:49] that's not up to us
[1:12:51] the question I think about the parable
[1:12:53] of the man that hired the workers in the
[1:12:57] Book of Matthew and he hired some early
[1:13:00] in the morning and in the if you read it
[1:13:02] I don't want to take the time because I
[1:13:04] have a little bit to get through and but
[1:13:05] he hires them in the morning and he
[1:13:07] tells them that he's going to give them
[1:13:09] a penny
[1:13:11] and so then after he hires them the
[1:13:13] Bible says the third hour and then you
[1:13:16] know he goes on the sixth hour and a
[1:13:17] different times during the day he hired
[1:13:19] more and in that he said I will give you
[1:13:21] what's right you didn't say what he was
[1:13:23] paying them
[1:13:24] and he'd come up to the 11th hour and he
[1:13:26] hires someone he's hired some people at
[1:13:28] the 11th Hour
[1:13:30] comes to the end of the day and those
[1:13:31] workers who worked the shortest amount
[1:13:33] of time got paid first and they got paid
[1:13:35] a penny as well
[1:13:37] and of course the people that labored
[1:13:38] the whole day they didn't like that
[1:13:41] but you know he said am I not able to do
[1:13:43] with what I want am I not just
[1:13:46] and I want you to think about it you
[1:13:48] know we've been serving the lord I've
[1:13:49] been I was a boy when when the message
[1:13:51] came our way and so it's been you know
[1:13:53] 50 plus years that the message has been
[1:13:56] that we've been serving the lord in this
[1:13:58] message and
[1:13:59] but you know there's going to be people
[1:14:00] come in at the last hour like the thief
[1:14:02] on the cross
[1:14:03] thief on the cross lived his entire life
[1:14:05] in sin
[1:14:07] he gets on the cross
[1:14:08] and he's there and he recognizes and he
[1:14:12] says Lord remember me remember me he
[1:14:15] says
[1:14:16] and here he's in his dying moments
[1:14:19] but you know those ones that come in in
[1:14:21] the final hours of this age that we're
[1:14:23] in which I don't believe we're going to
[1:14:24] be here a whole lot longer they're going
[1:14:26] to get the same reward as us
[1:14:28] but you know I I don't feel bad about
[1:14:30] that
[1:14:32] I've got loved ones out there I'll be
[1:14:34] quite happy
[1:14:35] if they when they come in not if they
[1:14:37] come in but when they come in
[1:14:39] and that's how you have to look at it
[1:14:41] too when they come in
[1:14:44] so there will be some that come in and
[1:14:46] those Final hours gone we'll remember
[1:14:49] and we'll save those ones
[1:14:52] now Abraham we know that God gave a
[1:14:54] promise to Abraham
[1:14:56] that he would be the father of a great
[1:14:58] nation and that they would be a stranger
[1:15:00] in a land would serve them you know for
[1:15:03] 400 years and so on and we know that
[1:15:05] that that happened and then it comes
[1:15:08] down to the time closer to the time of
[1:15:11] their Deliverance
[1:15:13] and what happens there I want to go to
[1:15:14] Exodus 2.
[1:15:16] in Exodus 2
[1:15:18] what's very interesting is that you know
[1:15:20] the children of Israel went down into
[1:15:21] Egypt as guests
[1:15:23] and they were comfortable there
[1:15:25] and there was no pressure
[1:15:27] and when it comes time for them to be
[1:15:29] delivered God had to turn the heat up on
[1:15:31] them a little bit because they really
[1:15:33] were enjoying things too much
[1:15:35] and I want you to think about the time
[1:15:37] we're in now you know I fear sometimes
[1:15:39] that we might be a little bit too
[1:15:41] comfortable but we see what's going on
[1:15:44] in the world now I know for me and it's
[1:15:46] not just because I'm getting older but
[1:15:48] this world is not as nice a place as it
[1:15:50] used to be
[1:15:52] and and more and more year after year I
[1:15:54] feel myself
[1:15:56] Desiring to move on
[1:15:59] really there's there's a lot less that I
[1:16:02] enjoy about this life now
[1:16:04] because of the sin and because of the
[1:16:06] direction it's going
[1:16:07] and I think that that's intentional
[1:16:09] because the Bible says you know when you
[1:16:11] see these things become come to pass
[1:16:13] look up for your Redemption draweth nigh
[1:16:15] he says that he is coming for those who
[1:16:18] are looking for him if we're not looking
[1:16:20] for him I would be a little bit fearful
[1:16:22] that we might be left behind he's coming
[1:16:25] for them they were looking it says in
[1:16:27] Revelation even so Lord Jesus come
[1:16:31] when we are praying those kind of
[1:16:33] prayers then I think we're getting
[1:16:34] really close because that's what
[1:16:36] happened here Exodus 2 verse 23 it come
[1:16:39] to pass in the process of time that the
[1:16:41] king of Egypt died and the children of
[1:16:43] Israel sighed by reason of the bondage
[1:16:45] and they cried
[1:16:47] and their Cry came up unto God by reason
[1:16:50] of the bondage and notice verse 24
[1:16:53] here's the trigger in this case and God
[1:16:56] heard their groaning and God remembered
[1:17:00] his Covenant with Abraham he hadn't
[1:17:02] forgot it
[1:17:03] but now they were in the condition to
[1:17:05] receive it and their groaning was that
[1:17:07] trigger okay it's time to bring that
[1:17:09] thought forward
[1:17:11] he remembered his Covenant and he looked
[1:17:13] upon the children of Israel it says in
[1:17:15] verse 25 and had respect unto them and
[1:17:18] from there we know that he begins to
[1:17:20] call Moses and and and and bring him
[1:17:22] there for the Deliverance
[1:17:28] I want to look at Hannah
[1:17:29] another one in the Bible who had a
[1:17:31] problem where she was not able to Bear
[1:17:33] children
[1:17:36] and she was you know just like Rachel
[1:17:39] desirous that the Lord would Minister to
[1:17:41] that and and but she had it you know her
[1:17:45] husband had another wife penina who
[1:17:48] who was able to have children and so she
[1:17:49] rubbed it in a lot
[1:17:52] to her and and uh and in fact the Bible
[1:17:55] refers to her as an adversary in many
[1:17:57] ways you know devil loves to rub things
[1:17:59] in when things are not going the way you
[1:18:02] want to or you're trying to to move on
[1:18:04] with he loves to to rub it in when when
[1:18:06] you don't seem to be making progress
[1:18:09] that's just he loves to do that and so
[1:18:11] she keeps praying she was just so so
[1:18:14] upset that she finally goes down there
[1:18:16] to Shiloh and and before the priest and
[1:18:19] she begins to to speak to him about that
[1:18:21] and and there the Lord at that time
[1:18:24] began to Quicken a seed of faith in her
[1:18:28] heart and the Bible says and just saving
[1:18:30] time again that she went away from there
[1:18:32] with that Faith with that 25 cents as it
[1:18:35] were
[1:18:36] and and their countenance was no more
[1:18:38] sad you can read it in the scriptures
[1:18:39] there
[1:18:41] and when she comes back from there
[1:18:44] the Bible says and just for reference
[1:18:47] sake it's in first Samuel 1 and verse
[1:18:50] 19.
[1:18:51] it says they rose up early in the
[1:18:53] morning early sorry in the morning early
[1:18:55] and worshiped before the Lord and
[1:18:57] returned came to their house to Rhema
[1:18:59] and Elkin knew Hannah his wife and the
[1:19:02] Lord remembered her
[1:19:04] Lord remembered her
[1:19:07] and and and and and the and the next
[1:19:09] verse actually says when we come to
[1:19:10] passive when the time was come about
[1:19:12] after Hannah had conceived she bear a
[1:19:14] son called his name Samuel Samuel saying
[1:19:17] because I have asked him of the Lord
[1:19:21] so God was responding to her prayer it
[1:19:25] was her prayer he was responding to he
[1:19:27] was remembering her
[1:19:29] he was remembering her
[1:19:31] now I want to go back to the original
[1:19:33] scripture that we read
[1:19:34] here and we just read a portion of it
[1:19:36] but I want to go back and look at this
[1:19:39] this story and this is when God comes
[1:19:42] down and visits Abraham
[1:19:43] with the two angels that were going to
[1:19:45] go to Sodom
[1:19:47] and so I want to pick this up and and
[1:19:49] look at it in just a little bit of
[1:19:50] detail in Genesis chapter 18. beginning
[1:19:53] at the 16th verse
[1:19:56] they're there and they have a have some
[1:19:58] time of Fellowship together
[1:20:00] and then it says in the 16th verse that
[1:20:02] the men rose up from thence and look
[1:20:03] towards Sodom and Abraham went with him
[1:20:06] to bring them on the way and of course
[1:20:08] they're getting ready now to go to Sodom
[1:20:10] and we know why they're going to Sodom
[1:20:12] but Abraham doesn't know why they're
[1:20:13] going to Sodom not just yet
[1:20:16] and notice verse 17 and the Lord said
[1:20:19] shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[1:20:21] which I do
[1:20:24] seeing that Abraham shall become shall
[1:20:27] surely become a great and mighty nation
[1:20:28] and all the nations of the Earth shall
[1:20:30] be blessed in him
[1:20:32] and notice this part verse 19 4 I know
[1:20:35] him
[1:20:37] for I know him
[1:20:38] see God knew that when Abraham became
[1:20:41] aware of what was going on
[1:20:43] that it was going to cause Abraham to do
[1:20:45] something that actually made a huge
[1:20:47] difference in the outcome
[1:20:50] he said for I know him that he will
[1:20:52] command his children in his household
[1:20:54] after him that they shall keep the way
[1:20:56] of the Lord to do justice and judgment
[1:20:58] and that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
[1:21:00] that which he has spoken of him
[1:21:03] so God knew the reaction so he tells
[1:21:06] Abraham what's going on that they're
[1:21:08] going to in verse 20 he said because of
[1:21:10] the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great
[1:21:12] and because their sin is very Grievous
[1:21:14] and Abraham knew this he said I'm going
[1:21:16] to go down and see whether they have
[1:21:19] done all together according to the Cry
[1:21:21] of it which has come unto me and if not
[1:21:23] I will know
[1:21:24] and so then the men the two angels
[1:21:27] turned their faces from thence and went
[1:21:28] towards Sodom and Abraham stood yet
[1:21:31] before the Lord
[1:21:34] now it sinks in Abraham realizes what is
[1:21:37] coming he knows that when they go down
[1:21:39] there the condition of Sodom that God is
[1:21:42] not going to let it let it get by
[1:21:45] and so he's thinking about that and so
[1:21:47] his response his very next response in
[1:21:50] the 23rd verse Abraham draws near to the
[1:21:53] Lord he says wilt thou also destroy the
[1:21:56] righteous with the wicked
[1:21:59] now you might think why would Abraham
[1:22:01] ask that question why would he ask
[1:22:03] because they're they're all Wicked
[1:22:05] he asked because he had family there
[1:22:08] he had a nephew there
[1:22:11] and and you know lot is referred to as a
[1:22:15] righteous man but brother Branham said
[1:22:17] he was really lukewarm and half backslid
[1:22:22] but he was a believer of some of sorts
[1:22:24] but he wasn't really where he should be
[1:22:26] or he wouldn't have been down there in
[1:22:27] the first place
[1:22:29] and so Abraham begins to ask these
[1:22:32] questions you know would you destroy for
[1:22:34] 50 and for 40 and so on he goes down to
[1:22:36] 10.
[1:22:37] and he said well if there's 10 righteous
[1:22:39] I won't destroy it and then
[1:22:41] and then they go their separate ways
[1:22:43] Abraham goes to his place
[1:22:45] and the Lord goes and he goes home
[1:22:48] and you know Abraham was probably
[1:22:50] thinking well is there even ten
[1:22:53] righteous there and he you know he's
[1:22:55] doing the math you know it
[1:22:57] got lot and his wife you got the two
[1:23:00] daughters maybe maybe their husbands so
[1:23:02] you're up to about six but
[1:23:05] and it doesn't mention about any
[1:23:06] children if they had children
[1:23:08] but he's he's a little short
[1:23:11] of 10.
[1:23:12] and so Abraham probably went to bed that
[1:23:14] night you know kind of wondering how is
[1:23:16] this going to turn out how is this going
[1:23:18] to play out
[1:23:21] well we flipped the scene over to to
[1:23:23] Sodom in Genesis 19
[1:23:27] and verse 12 the Angels come to lot's
[1:23:29] house it's interesting why do they go to
[1:23:31] lot's house we'll find out
[1:23:34] here soon it says in verse 12 the man
[1:23:37] said the Lord has that when he hear
[1:23:38] besides son-in-law and sons and
[1:23:41] daughters and whatsoever though hassle
[1:23:43] the city bring them out of this place
[1:23:45] for we will destroy this place because
[1:23:47] the Cry of them is waxing great before
[1:23:49] the face of the Lord and the Lord has
[1:23:51] sent us to destroy it
[1:23:52] well that's pretty strong words I should
[1:23:54] have been enough for lot and it did stir
[1:23:57] him up the Bible says in verse 14 he
[1:23:59] goes out and speaks to his sons-in-laws
[1:24:01] which married his daughters and say you
[1:24:03] know get you out of this place for the
[1:24:05] Lord will destroy the city but he seemed
[1:24:07] as one that mocked to his sons he
[1:24:10] couldn't even convince them
[1:24:12] the only ones he could convince were his
[1:24:14] own flesh and blood
[1:24:16] so it was just the four
[1:24:18] but the interesting thing is when the
[1:24:19] morning comes and the 15th verse the
[1:24:22] morning comes Lots not really ready to
[1:24:24] go
[1:24:26] the Bible says when the morning arose
[1:24:28] the Angels hastened law pressed him
[1:24:31] urged him saying you need to take your
[1:24:33] wife and your daughters which are here
[1:24:34] unless thou be consumed in the iniquity
[1:24:36] of the city but lot didn't rush to leave
[1:24:39] verse 16. Wally lingard the Bible said
[1:24:41] that men laid hold on his hands
[1:24:44] they weren't really going to go without
[1:24:46] being forced
[1:24:49] he said the men laid hold on his hand
[1:24:51] one upon his wife and upon the hand of
[1:24:53] his two daughters notice what it says
[1:24:55] the Lord being merciful unto him and
[1:24:58] they brought him forth and set him
[1:24:59] without the city
[1:25:02] so when you look at this
[1:25:05] lot's salvation as it were from the
[1:25:09] destruction of Sodom
[1:25:10] really hadn't didn't have much to do
[1:25:12] with lot
[1:25:14] it was the mercy of God
[1:25:16] but why was it that way
[1:25:19] why was it that way well let's look at
[1:25:22] the verse 27.
[1:25:24] Abraham gets up in the morning probably
[1:25:26] didn't sleep a whole lot thinking about
[1:25:29] what might take place the Bible says
[1:25:31] Abraham gets up early in the morning to
[1:25:32] the place where he stood before the Lord
[1:25:36] and he looks over at Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:25:38] and toward the land of the plain and
[1:25:39] behold the smoke of the country went up
[1:25:41] as a smoke of a furnace
[1:25:44] so he sees the destruction I imagine
[1:25:46] he's wondering what happened what
[1:25:48] happens a lot what happened to his
[1:25:50] family but notice the 29th verse
[1:25:53] he came to pass when God destroyed the
[1:25:55] cities of the plain that God remembered
[1:25:57] Abraham
[1:25:59] it wasn't a lot he was remembering it
[1:26:02] was Abraham
[1:26:04] and sent lot out lot didn't even want to
[1:26:07] go out but it was Abraham
[1:26:09] it was Abraham's request you say I don't
[1:26:11] know if I believe that well let me tell
[1:26:12] you what brother Brandon said in hearing
[1:26:14] recognizing and acting on the word of
[1:26:16] God
[1:26:17] brother Branham said
[1:26:19] speaking about lot
[1:26:21] he said he'd have never come out
[1:26:23] he had he'd have never been called out
[1:26:25] called not even called out
[1:26:28] if it had not been for the mercy
[1:26:30] of Abraham
[1:26:33] the mercy of Abraham
[1:26:35] can I find 50 men when he asks those
[1:26:37] questions it was the mercy of Abraham
[1:26:39] that lot was called out now think about
[1:26:41] your loved ones that you're praying for
[1:26:45] you you say what what influence do I
[1:26:47] have I'm going to read you something
[1:26:48] towards the end about that but your
[1:26:51] prayers don't think that they have no
[1:26:52] effect
[1:26:53] you might look at them out there and say
[1:26:55] well they don't seem like they're
[1:26:56] they're coming any it looks like they're
[1:26:57] going further away
[1:26:59] it's going to be your one of these days
[1:27:01] it's going to be your mercy one of these
[1:27:03] days God is going to remember you he's
[1:27:05] going to remember your prayers for your
[1:27:07] loved ones
[1:27:09] and he's going to bring them up
[1:27:19] and you know prayer is so powerful we
[1:27:22] underestimate it that even the prayers
[1:27:24] of those that have passed on
[1:27:27] you know it's God's answers though
[1:27:29] sometimes after they're gone
[1:27:33] brother Branham was having a baptismal
[1:27:35] service for his son Billy Paul and his
[1:27:37] nephew Melvin
[1:27:39] in 1950 he was he was getting ready to
[1:27:41] baptize him and he's he relates this
[1:27:43] statement
[1:27:45] he said Heavenly Father 1900 years since
[1:27:48] the scripture has been written and your
[1:27:49] promise is still moving on
[1:27:51] and he said now Lord hear these young
[1:27:53] people there were two young ladies on
[1:27:54] his right they've accepted you as their
[1:27:56] savior they believe the gospel story to
[1:27:58] my left Lord is my little nephew Melvin
[1:28:01] and my own boy
[1:28:03] he said oh God if it's possible this
[1:28:05] morning that the two mothers could be
[1:28:07] called to look over the banister and to
[1:28:09] look down and see their boys now
[1:28:11] he said how happy I am Lord to know that
[1:28:15] you answer prayer
[1:28:18] he said that poor little mother Ruth
[1:28:19] that would have been Melvin's mother he
[1:28:21] said that poor little mother Ruth she's
[1:28:23] gone on years ago
[1:28:25] but her prayer is answered now
[1:28:28] prayers answered now
[1:28:30] she prayed that he would love you and
[1:28:31] serve you and he's making this stand
[1:28:33] this morning
[1:28:35] to these others their mothers maybe has
[1:28:37] gone on Lord we don't know
[1:28:38] thou does but whatever he said answer
[1:28:41] prayer
[1:28:43] there's another time brother Brown gives
[1:28:45] an altar call it's actually it was in
[1:28:47] Shreveport the message love in 1956 and
[1:28:50] you're probably familiar with this quote
[1:28:51] but this this piece of the quote was
[1:28:53] always stood out to me
[1:28:55] the young people had come to the Altar
[1:28:56] and brother Branham made the statement
[1:28:58] he said I feel God that everyone here at
[1:29:00] this altar has been accepted in your
[1:29:02] sight that's pretty rare thing
[1:29:04] you know I've been at youth camps and
[1:29:06] different times people come to the Altar
[1:29:07] and a lot of them go through the same
[1:29:09] and put on the you know go through the
[1:29:11] same motions but a lot of them walk away
[1:29:13] the same as they came unfortunately
[1:29:16] but brother Brown said I believe every
[1:29:18] one of these at the altar has been
[1:29:19] accepted he said their names are on the
[1:29:21] book angels are singing bells of Heaven
[1:29:23] Are Ringing Satan's defeated and they're
[1:29:25] moving back down the corners of hell
[1:29:27] with their black flags draping
[1:29:29] but I want you to notice this he said
[1:29:31] the angels have gone to heaven to
[1:29:33] Rejoice around the throne where mothers
[1:29:35] and fathers are waiting to hear the
[1:29:37] message coming back from this meeting
[1:29:40] he said they've got boys and girls
[1:29:42] sitting here where loved ones has gone
[1:29:43] on and they're waiting I believe those
[1:29:45] loved ones that have gone on it also
[1:29:46] prayed for them
[1:29:48] I've got two older brothers that don't
[1:29:50] serve the Lord my mom and dad prayed for
[1:29:51] them absolutely all the time
[1:29:53] and they're both gone
[1:29:55] but I believe one of these days God's
[1:29:57] going to remember
[1:29:58] those prayers
[1:30:02] you know there's a scripture and it's
[1:30:03] it's been quoted often in Jeremiah where
[1:30:05] it talks about God is going to come and
[1:30:08] perform his good word and that he knows
[1:30:10] the thoughts that he thinks of us
[1:30:12] thoughts of peace to give us an expected
[1:30:15] end
[1:30:17] you know the the believer
[1:30:19] we we know what's coming we know what
[1:30:23] our end is we know where things are
[1:30:25] going we may not know tomorrow and
[1:30:27] specifically in our life but we know
[1:30:28] where this is going to end up
[1:30:30] and God's got good plans and good things
[1:30:32] in store for his people
[1:30:35] but you know the world doesn't have that
[1:30:36] the sinner doesn't have that but we have
[1:30:38] that confidence that God has an
[1:30:42] objective and everything that God brings
[1:30:44] our way it's with purpose
[1:30:46] nothing happens just accidental nothing
[1:30:48] just happens randomly
[1:30:50] might seem that way to you
[1:30:52] and it might seem surprising as well
[1:30:54] sometimes things happen it just shocks
[1:30:56] you sometimes almost paralyzes you when
[1:30:58] when you encounter some trials and tests
[1:31:00] but nothing surprises God he knew it was
[1:31:03] coming
[1:31:04] he allowed it to be he may have even
[1:31:06] ordained it to be
[1:31:09] but God is is going to bring everything
[1:31:11] the Bible says all things work together
[1:31:13] for good
[1:31:14] to them that love the Lord very simple
[1:31:15] scripture we quoted all the time but
[1:31:17] sometimes it's hard to believe that when
[1:31:19] they're in the middle of the trouble
[1:31:20] it's hard to believe there's going to be
[1:31:22] a good outcome how can good come of this
[1:31:24] but if you're a Believer when you get on
[1:31:26] the other side of that trial you can
[1:31:28] look back and
[1:31:29] and see how God brought you through and
[1:31:32] the purpose sometimes maybe you won't
[1:31:34] know all of all the ins and outs of it
[1:31:35] but God will bring you through it's not
[1:31:38] all Valley you know the god of the
[1:31:40] mountain is God in the valley too
[1:31:44] and so he has plans he's going to give
[1:31:46] us an expected end you know I read one
[1:31:49] time Charles Spurgeon said blessed be
[1:31:51] God it is an expected end
[1:31:53] he said the ungodly people can only look
[1:31:55] forward to a dreaded end
[1:31:58] an end of your foolish mirth an end of
[1:32:00] your carelessness an end of your
[1:32:01] boasting he said you fear your end but
[1:32:03] God will give his people an expected end
[1:32:07] suppose he said that end should be the
[1:32:09] coming of Christ oh how we long for it
[1:32:13] he said brother and the Saints are
[1:32:15] prepared before they go
[1:32:17] our Lord does not pluck his fruit on
[1:32:19] wisely
[1:32:20] foolish State people he said May tear
[1:32:22] the green apples from the tree with a
[1:32:24] pull and a ranch and Bruise them as they
[1:32:26] throw them into the basket but our Lord
[1:32:28] values his fruit and he waits until it
[1:32:30] is quite ripe and he gathers it
[1:32:32] sometimes we wonder why our loved one's
[1:32:33] different things but God knows he has a
[1:32:36] purpose he has a time for everything he
[1:32:38] doesn't make any mistakes
[1:32:42] when he puts forth his hand and he said
[1:32:44] the fruit bows down to it and parts from
[1:32:47] the bow without a strain
[1:32:49] when the believer comes to die it will
[1:32:50] not be to an end in which he feared but
[1:32:53] to an end which he expected
[1:32:58] now at the very end of things when the
[1:33:00] we go to the Book of Revelations when
[1:33:02] things are wrapping up there's two
[1:33:03] things that God is going to remember
[1:33:04] since we're speaking about God's memory
[1:33:08] in Revelation 18 it talks about how that
[1:33:10] God will remember the iniquities and the
[1:33:13] sins of the unrepentant sinner
[1:33:15] speaks to that in Revelation 18 and 4
[1:33:18] and 5. but he also will remember the
[1:33:20] prayers of the righteous in Revelation 5
[1:33:22] and 8. it talks about how that when when
[1:33:25] he took the book The Four beasts and the
[1:33:27] Four and Twenty Elders fell down and it
[1:33:28] talked about they had Harps and golden
[1:33:31] vials full of odors which were the
[1:33:33] prayers of the Saints so some of your
[1:33:35] prayers you know they're they're used
[1:33:36] now and they're going to accomplish
[1:33:38] things some of those prayers are going
[1:33:39] to be poured out one day
[1:33:41] over there
[1:33:44] now I was reading one when I was looking
[1:33:46] at this message in the Book of Malachi
[1:33:48] and there's a reference in there to
[1:33:50] something called The Book of remembrance
[1:33:53] we know there's a book of life and all
[1:33:55] these things that write your life story
[1:33:57] and The Sinner and it has a book too it
[1:34:00] has things that track what happens in
[1:34:02] their life but there's this it was
[1:34:03] interesting the way that it reads in
[1:34:06] Malachi 3 and so I just wanted to to
[1:34:08] mention this Malachi 3 verse 16.
[1:34:12] he said then they that feared the Lord
[1:34:14] spake often one to another which is a
[1:34:18] good thing for a believer
[1:34:20] to do to Fellowship but notice what it
[1:34:22] says the Lord hearkened and heard it so
[1:34:25] the Lord pays attention
[1:34:27] to our conversations
[1:34:29] to the things that we do he said look
[1:34:31] they that fear the lord speak often one
[1:34:32] to another the Lord hearkened and heard
[1:34:34] it and the Book of remembrance was
[1:34:35] written
[1:34:36] before him for them that feared the Lord
[1:34:39] so this is very specific to these groups
[1:34:42] this group of people that fear the lord
[1:34:44] and that thought upon his name
[1:34:46] so the contents of this book
[1:34:49] are things that God took note of in our
[1:34:52] lives the things that were important
[1:34:54] that were memorable
[1:34:56] of those that feared the Lord and verse
[1:34:59] 17 referring to these people of whom I
[1:35:02] trust all of us are apart
[1:35:04] he said and they shall be mine
[1:35:07] saith the Lord of hosts in that day when
[1:35:09] I make up my jewels and I will spare
[1:35:11] them as a man spareth his own son that
[1:35:14] serveth him
[1:35:16] God's Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know
[1:35:19] he watches me he's looking at us and
[1:35:22] mindful of us
[1:35:25] and so
[1:35:27] when we look back in our lives we see
[1:35:28] the flaws and we see all of those things
[1:35:31] but God as I said earlier looks at us
[1:35:34] differently than we look at ourselves
[1:35:36] brother Brown said the things that you
[1:35:37] do the words that you say and how you
[1:35:39] treat your neighbor and what you do
[1:35:40] about Christ will be an everlasting
[1:35:42] Memorial
[1:35:44] you know we have the opportunity as
[1:35:46] Christians that God can because he can
[1:35:48] forget the sins that we make you know he
[1:35:51] can edit our record
[1:35:53] you know like you do when you're typing
[1:35:54] up something you know you can get that
[1:35:56] thing just perfect well God's wanting to
[1:35:58] do that with each one of us
[1:36:00] yes we make mistakes every day but God
[1:36:02] just kind of takes care of that
[1:36:04] so that when the record is done it's all
[1:36:06] good things
[1:36:09] and a real good way to look at that
[1:36:12] is to compare the Old Testament in the
[1:36:14] New Testament when you look at Hebrews
[1:36:15] 11 you read Hebrews 11 it's a summary of
[1:36:19] The Heroes of Faith
[1:36:21] and you know those those men and women
[1:36:23] that are referenced because there's
[1:36:24] women reference there too in those in
[1:36:26] that scripture you know they had
[1:36:29] mistakes and made mistakes and if you go
[1:36:31] to the Old Testament which didn't leave
[1:36:33] anything out you can read about Abraham
[1:36:35] and Sarah for example you can see things
[1:36:37] with Abraham you see Sarah you know we
[1:36:40] often criticize Sarah oh she she didn't
[1:36:42] believe how much doubt she had
[1:36:44] but you know the record in Hebrews of
[1:36:46] Sarah doesn't mention that
[1:36:48] Hebrews 11 11 you know it's a memorable
[1:36:51] actually even a memorable scripture
[1:36:53] because we know uh you know we we
[1:36:55] celebrate you call it Veterans Day here
[1:36:57] but on November 11th the 11th day the
[1:36:59] 11th month the 11th Hour of the day we
[1:37:02] call it Remembrance Day at home
[1:37:04] well on the the 11th verse of the 11th
[1:37:07] chapter of Hebrews talks about Sarah
[1:37:10] and I want to read that scripture
[1:37:11] because this is her this is the summary
[1:37:14] this is the memory this is what's
[1:37:16] memorable about Sarah in the New
[1:37:19] Testament through faith also Sarah
[1:37:21] faith
[1:37:23] herself through faith also Sarah herself
[1:37:27] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:37:31] was delivered to a child when she was
[1:37:32] past age why because she judged him
[1:37:35] faithful who had promised we know
[1:37:38] Abraham was faithful when we talk about
[1:37:39] Abraham's Faith but with Sarah we often
[1:37:42] go back to the Old Testament we often
[1:37:44] point to the mistake
[1:37:46] but doesn't mention the mistake here
[1:37:49] because Sarah did have to come to a
[1:37:51] place where she believed just like
[1:37:52] Abraham for her body to be changed it
[1:37:55] wasn't enough for Abraham to believe she
[1:37:57] had to believe
[1:37:58] and she come to that place finally might
[1:38:00] have took her a little bit longer than
[1:38:01] him but she got there and that's what
[1:38:04] God remembers that's what was important
[1:38:06] enough that it was written of her here
[1:38:08] in the scripture
[1:38:10] and so if we can look at if we can I
[1:38:12] mean that's a good example
[1:38:14] we look at our lives we can see those
[1:38:16] times when we weren't very faithful when
[1:38:18] we've had you know made mistakes and
[1:38:20] said things that were not very good
[1:38:22] but if you put those things under the
[1:38:23] blood
[1:38:24] they're gone
[1:38:26] they're gone from the record and then
[1:38:27] what's left are those good things the
[1:38:29] times you did reach out in faith the
[1:38:30] times you did stand
[1:38:32] those are the things that God will
[1:38:34] remember of you
[1:38:37] brother Brown preached a message and I'm
[1:38:39] going to close here soon in just a few
[1:38:42] moments
[1:38:43] with this thought
[1:38:45] he preached a message called Mother's
[1:38:47] Day in 1959 he was 50 years old at the
[1:38:49] time
[1:38:50] you know and by that time he had lost a
[1:38:52] number of his loved ones and in that
[1:38:54] message he was reminiscing about what it
[1:38:56] would be like when he got over to the
[1:38:58] other side and he began to meet some of
[1:39:01] those ones and he he related in that
[1:39:03] message he said the first one probably
[1:39:04] he would see would be his baby Sharon
[1:39:08] and he said you know she she won't be
[1:39:09] shaking with meningitis when I see her
[1:39:12] and then he thought about his wife hope
[1:39:14] he said she won't have those bony hands
[1:39:16] and the sunken cheeks which is the way
[1:39:18] he remembered her when she left
[1:39:20] then he then he mentioned Edward and
[1:39:23] Charles
[1:39:24] he said Charles won't be dragging his
[1:39:26] leg his dad his brother Howard who had
[1:39:28] got right with the Lord just a few days
[1:39:30] before he left he was just reflecting on
[1:39:32] these and then he made the statement
[1:39:33] after that he said we'll come brother
[1:39:35] Seward and brother Frank broy brother
[1:39:37] George the ark always said the
[1:39:40] resurrection means a lot to me
[1:39:42] he had a lot of a lot of people that had
[1:39:44] gone on and and as we get older we have
[1:39:46] those things too I got my parents and
[1:39:48] different ones that have gone on soon
[1:39:50] there'll be more over there maybe than
[1:39:52] here in many ways
[1:39:53] you know but he said the resurrection
[1:39:55] means a lot to me I'm anticipating on
[1:39:57] that great crowning hour he said as the
[1:40:00] light begins to spread he said we'll
[1:40:02] know
[1:40:03] as we are known
[1:40:05] and we'll understand and we'll remember
[1:40:07] our acquaintances the ones that's been
[1:40:09] here been there
[1:40:10] and I want you to catch this here and
[1:40:12] you may have heard this before but this
[1:40:14] has always been really striking to me
[1:40:16] it's always been really encouraging to
[1:40:18] me brother Branham said they'll he said
[1:40:21] he said many
[1:40:23] many he said there will be many there
[1:40:26] that we didn't even think would be there
[1:40:30] many there think about that can you I
[1:40:33] can think of people
[1:40:35] I can think of some of my loved ones
[1:40:36] right now that if the war was to come
[1:40:38] tonight I would think I don't know
[1:40:40] in my flesh
[1:40:42] he said when we get over there there'll
[1:40:43] be many there that we didn't even think
[1:40:46] would be there
[1:40:49] but I want you to here's the thing why
[1:40:52] will they be there I want you to notice
[1:40:54] what he said he said for I know it's at
[1:40:56] that time I believe that the bread that
[1:40:57] we have cast upon the human Troubled
[1:41:00] Waters will return to us upon that day
[1:41:02] why it was your effort it was my effort
[1:41:05] what we have shown the seeds that we
[1:41:07] have sown he said when we see the
[1:41:09] effects of Our Testimony
[1:41:11] on people that we didn't understand
[1:41:12] their action toward it
[1:41:15] how many times have we tried to witness
[1:41:16] or we tried to you know shed a light
[1:41:19] somewhere and it just seemed like it
[1:41:21] wasn't accomplishing anything but it was
[1:41:24] but it was
[1:41:26] we didn't understand why they were
[1:41:28] acting that he said they'll probably be
[1:41:29] there what a day that will be and here's
[1:41:31] what it goes on he said in the seeds
[1:41:33] that we sowed
[1:41:34] not even thinking what they would do we
[1:41:37] just sowed the seeds he said
[1:41:39] but here they are
[1:41:41] the seeds that we sowed and who are
[1:41:43] those seeds he said they brought forth
[1:41:46] precious fruits those seeds that we sow
[1:41:47] those seeds that you have sown
[1:41:49] he said they brought forth precious
[1:41:51] fruits and we will see them on that day
[1:41:54] the Wayward loved ones and relatives
[1:41:57] and we all have them we all have those
[1:42:00] Wayward loved ones and relatives that
[1:42:02] we've been trying to sow seeds with and
[1:42:04] sometimes we don't see seems like it's
[1:42:06] not do anything but don't stop sowing
[1:42:08] the seeds
[1:42:09] because God will remember don't stop
[1:42:12] praying for them because God will
[1:42:14] remember
[1:42:15] one of these days it may not be until we
[1:42:18] cross over that we see the realization
[1:42:19] of some of those
[1:42:21] but that doesn't mean we should stop
[1:42:24] God will do it God will remember
[1:42:28] he will remember you
[1:42:29] he will remember your prayers
