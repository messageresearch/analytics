[1:15:26] amen
[1:15:28] ah
[1:15:29] so by the grace of God if I could share
[1:15:31] with you some other thoughts concerning
[1:15:34] the rapture
[1:15:36] and it saws that I have expressed and
[1:15:39] ministered on some years ago
[1:15:41] but I want to share with you again
[1:15:43] because we're getting closer and closer
[1:15:45] to the rapture we're getting closer and
[1:15:47] closer to what God is requiring of us
[1:15:50] and there's anything that God has
[1:15:51] requiring of us now it is rapturing
[1:15:53] Faith amen it is one thing to say Lord I
[1:15:57] believe you sent the messenger I believe
[1:15:59] there was it was Malachi 4 you did this
[1:16:01] you revealed the seals you revealed this
[1:16:03] mystery of that mystery that's good but
[1:16:06] what's what's what's it accomplishing in
[1:16:07] US amen there's one thing to bring us
[1:16:11] out of the denominations oh yes but it's
[1:16:13] another thing to bring us into the word
[1:16:15] into the message and into Christ it's
[1:16:18] another thing to bring us into the faith
[1:16:19] that God is looking for praise the name
[1:16:22] of the Lord and it's more than just
[1:16:24] coming at our denominations that's
[1:16:25] coming into Christ again as I said it's
[1:16:28] like one time when I was kneeling at
[1:16:30] adulter at a certain church and there
[1:16:32] were the others uh around praying and
[1:16:35] again this this believer that was just
[1:16:38] kneeling to the left of me there and
[1:16:40] they they were praying his oh Lord thank
[1:16:42] you for bringing us out of denomination
[1:16:43] and thank you Lord so that we don't have
[1:16:46] to come under any man anymore and I said
[1:16:48] Lord I said I said they don't have the
[1:16:51] Revelation I said because you're going
[1:16:54] to bring them bring it up from under the
[1:16:55] control of one to the control of another
[1:16:57] amen I tell you this they weren't under
[1:17:00] they weren't under the leadership of the
[1:17:02] Egyptians in Egypt but I tell you when
[1:17:04] they came out of Egypt they were under
[1:17:06] the leadership of Moses and and and and
[1:17:08] Aaron I believe it was Joshua and so on
[1:17:11] Amen so brother because of why it's
[1:17:13] God's leadership is what God does and
[1:17:15] how God does it amen don't think oh
[1:17:18] we're free so I don't have to listen to
[1:17:19] anybody amen God is ordained the God has
[1:17:22] set in the church amen the faithful
[1:17:25] Ministry and why this and why that why
[1:17:27] did God do it that way it's to test your
[1:17:30] faith amen not only the test your faith
[1:17:33] is to increase your faith amen because
[1:17:35] if you're going if you're going to
[1:17:36] recognize that this is God and this is
[1:17:38] this is what God does and this is how
[1:17:40] God is doing it amen it's going to
[1:17:42] increase your faith amen there's too
[1:17:45] many thinking that oh God came through
[1:17:47] the message of the prophet and he
[1:17:48] brought us out of denominations now we
[1:17:50] don't have now we don't have to be
[1:17:51] subject to any man now we don't have to
[1:17:53] ever have any leadership with Lord we
[1:17:55] just let you lead but I'll tell you this
[1:17:57] rather he'll bring you out from that but
[1:17:59] he'll bring you under another leadership
[1:18:01] almost definitely amen you're not under
[1:18:04] the leadership of denomination you're
[1:18:05] not under the leadership of the nominee
[1:18:07] those Brethren out there the ministry
[1:18:09] over there that's controlled by
[1:18:11] denominations my brother he's going to
[1:18:13] bring you out from under that Ministry
[1:18:14] to another Ministry most evidently again
[1:18:17] because as it is written that God has
[1:18:20] set in the church amen and the proud of
[1:18:23] God somebody asked the prophet of God
[1:18:25] the question concerning you know our
[1:18:27] ministry does the bride have a Ministry
[1:18:28] he said yes he said the bright God of
[1:18:31] ministry he said it's in the church and
[1:18:32] it's in the church now and he quoted
[1:18:34] Ephesians he said and God has said in
[1:18:37] the church this rightful Ministry amen
[1:18:39] but again we think because we came out
[1:18:42] out from under denominational rule that
[1:18:44] we come up from under the control of man
[1:18:46] we can have under the control of the
[1:18:49] leadership of ministry no not by any
[1:18:51] means amen God took you up from under
[1:18:54] that leadership and brought you under
[1:18:55] the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:58] and the leadership of the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:00] in a faithful Ministry amen the Republic
[1:19:03] of God has highlighted it the proper
[1:19:05] goddess has put the emphasis on it amen
[1:19:07] to get our attention to the ministry so
[1:19:10] it's not just coming out of denomination
[1:19:12] and oh yeah and now I believe the
[1:19:14] message with that sent I don't have
[1:19:15] listen to anybody else oh yes you do
[1:19:17] amen and God brought you out of that and
[1:19:20] he brought you under another Ministry to
[1:19:22] teach you the word he brought you in
[1:19:23] another Ministry to give you to give you
[1:19:25] the word that will give you the faith
[1:19:27] that will please God Amen
[1:19:29] and it's not just it's not just oh the
[1:19:32] Lord's going to do this the Lord's going
[1:19:33] to do that no no we're not without the
[1:19:36] ministry
[1:19:37] not without
[1:19:39] not by any means so brother and sister
[1:19:41] don't never think they that they oh they
[1:19:44] trust me so that I don't have to listen
[1:19:46] to this I don't have to listen to that I
[1:19:48] don't have to follow this ministry that
[1:19:50] Ministry amen sometimes God is testing
[1:19:52] your faith to follow him to see if
[1:19:54] you'll follow him in the ministry amen
[1:19:57] will you follow him in that ministry
[1:19:58] will you follow him in that Ministry
[1:20:00] where they acknowledge Him in that
[1:20:01] Ministry amen or the other Ministry amen
[1:20:04] as acknowledge in our Lord and believing
[1:20:06] that it was it was God ministering to us
[1:20:08] through our brother Jonathan amen God
[1:20:11] ministering to us through the other
[1:20:12] Ministries amen that he would send our
[1:20:14] way amen don't think we don't have to
[1:20:17] have it we don't I don't think we don't
[1:20:19] need it we do because brother God God
[1:20:21] has got a pattern God's Got A Plan God's
[1:20:24] got a purpose and this is this is what
[1:20:26] God is doing this is how God is going to
[1:20:28] do it brother all down true right from
[1:20:30] beginning to end there has been a
[1:20:32] Ministry amen God always has listened
[1:20:35] and whether even in the even in heaven
[1:20:36] he got the Angels amen that's right even
[1:20:40] in heaven the angel there to minister
[1:20:41] the angels are there to do this the
[1:20:43] angels are there to do that by the grace
[1:20:44] of almighty God Amen and yet there are
[1:20:47] so many Believers that think because God
[1:20:49] through the messenger of the hour the
[1:20:51] prophet of the hour brought us out of
[1:20:53] the denominations then we don't have to
[1:20:55] be under any man we don't have to be in
[1:20:56] any church you don't most definitely do
[1:20:59] amen and as Believers that have come out
[1:21:01] of denominations and they won't go to
[1:21:03] church they won't go to any church they
[1:21:05] they wanted they won't don't even bother
[1:21:07] the fellowship with Believers the
[1:21:09] fellowship with family and friends and
[1:21:11] neighbors but what about Believers Amen
[1:21:14] brother because we're there to minister
[1:21:16] to one another where they're they're
[1:21:17] there to encourage one another amen
[1:21:19] praise the name of the Lord until I pray
[1:21:22] the grace of God don't never let the
[1:21:24] devil give you that that that that that
[1:21:26] Spirit don't ever let the devil give you
[1:21:29] that feeling that you don't have to
[1:21:31] listen to a Ministry you don't have to
[1:21:33] come under a Ministry that you don't
[1:21:34] have to do this you don't have to do
[1:21:36] that brother the thing of it is say God
[1:21:38] brings us out from from the control of a
[1:21:40] denomination and amen into under the
[1:21:43] word
[1:21:44] amen back to the word amen and brother
[1:21:48] if you're coming back to the word
[1:21:49] brother if it was it was the Jews in the
[1:21:52] Old Testament he brought him under
[1:21:53] Prophet after Prophet after Prophet
[1:21:56] Ministry after Ministry after Ministry
[1:21:58] amen if they were looking for God they
[1:22:01] were looking for a Ministry amen and
[1:22:03] they had to recognize the ministry that
[1:22:05] God would send whether it was Isaiah the
[1:22:07] prophet or or in the Book of Genesis
[1:22:10] brother that Cain should have recognized
[1:22:12] the ministry that God was was witnessing
[1:22:15] to him through evil amen oh no he was
[1:22:18] judging Abel he argued with Abel oh yeah
[1:22:21] the Bible says they went out there and
[1:22:23] they just argued and fussed and and he
[1:22:25] killed Abel amen that's right and
[1:22:28] brother today there are those that would
[1:22:30] argue with the true Ministry of God and
[1:22:32] and kill them not necessarily physically
[1:22:34] but spiritually
[1:22:36] oh yes you're not necessarily God God is
[1:22:39] going to judge us not necessarily for
[1:22:41] killing somebody physically but you can
[1:22:43] kill the kill their influence amen
[1:22:45] spiritually amen that you can spread
[1:22:47] this word and that word concerning this
[1:22:49] brother this brother that brother amen
[1:22:51] amen to try and try that and and get the
[1:22:54] people oh just ignore that that brother
[1:22:56] amen be careful you're killing him
[1:23:00] amen and and to kill him you're gonna
[1:23:02] you're gonna kill God's influence
[1:23:05] amen and you're going to answer for it
[1:23:08] brother sister yes and Sir again against
[1:23:10] is there a respect again like he says
[1:23:12] respect our brother Jonathan here and
[1:23:14] and to believe that it is God
[1:23:15] ministering through the brother not not
[1:23:18] say oh hey brother Jonathan brother
[1:23:19] Jonathan no it's God so thank you Lord
[1:23:22] for the ministry thank you for what you
[1:23:23] said amen oh we're not not giving the
[1:23:26] glory to brother Jonathan because I sure
[1:23:28] he don't want it amen but we'll give the
[1:23:30] glory to God Amen and believe that it
[1:23:33] was God Ministry to us through the
[1:23:35] ministry God ministering through us to
[1:23:37] us through that Pastor that or that
[1:23:39] evangelist whoever whatever whatever
[1:23:41] calling he might have amen oh just don't
[1:23:44] don't think again and that's unfortunate
[1:23:46] that too many so-called Believers that
[1:23:48] believe that they are the bride but
[1:23:50] brother they don't they they'd
[1:23:52] absolutely refuse to come under the
[1:23:53] ministry oh yeah I've I've experienced
[1:23:56] those things over the years and I've
[1:23:58] experienced many who have amen took
[1:24:01] their stand as it were for the message
[1:24:03] and for the word but they wouldn't come
[1:24:05] under the ministry to counsel them in
[1:24:07] the word
[1:24:08] no no I've actually like I said I've
[1:24:11] experienced many like that that have
[1:24:13] done that over the years
[1:24:15] and brother they're better their spirit
[1:24:16] is not right
[1:24:18] their attitude is not right
[1:24:20] because again there's certain Ministries
[1:24:22] I'm not saying they're not trying to
[1:24:23] promote this one not by any means no but
[1:24:26] there's certain Ministries that God is
[1:24:28] in and God's with and to reject that
[1:24:29] Ministry you're rejecting God Amen to
[1:24:32] reject what our brother Jonathan was
[1:24:33] Ministry is to reject Jesus you're not
[1:24:36] rejecting brother Jonathan no you're
[1:24:38] rejecting Jesus amen and brother in the
[1:24:42] end brother at the time of the of the
[1:24:44] time of the Judgment amen they're going
[1:24:46] to be judged for rejecting the Lord and
[1:24:49] then they'll lord said you you didn't
[1:24:52] listen to me and they said listen to you
[1:24:54] what do you mean
[1:24:56] you didn't say this you didn't say yes I
[1:24:58] did
[1:25:00] and he said the Lord the Lord will open
[1:25:02] the sky there and he said there look up
[1:25:04] oh
[1:25:06] and he said they'll see this ministry
[1:25:09] they'll see Jesus ministry to that one
[1:25:10] Ministry through that one but he was
[1:25:12] ministering to these and they didn't
[1:25:13] recognize Jesus
[1:25:15] because they never recognize the
[1:25:17] ministry amen so let's record let's
[1:25:20] recognize the ministry let's recognize
[1:25:22] and do not recognize that as Jesus
[1:25:24] ministering to me
[1:25:25] is Jesus teaching me is Jesus meeting me
[1:25:28] amen we asked whether it's her our
[1:25:31] brother Jonathan this ministering there
[1:25:32] and we've had our brother Mark here
[1:25:34] minister a few times amen not lately but
[1:25:37] we may get him to do it again amen
[1:25:40] to exhort the Saints oh yes definitely
[1:25:43] if he's not if he's not ministering you
[1:25:46] you you could have the call to exhort Oh
[1:25:49] yes most definitely by the grace of
[1:25:51] almighty God so brother said let's let's
[1:25:53] recognize God and what God's doing it's
[1:25:56] not being put in our focus on man let's
[1:25:58] focus on God
[1:26:00] Amen brother there's too much going on
[1:26:02] today and then they're putting their
[1:26:04] focus on man man man and they'll raise
[1:26:07] this man up they'll raise that man up
[1:26:08] they're glorified this man or they'll
[1:26:09] put this one down put that one down and
[1:26:12] brother they're not recognizing Jesus
[1:26:15] God help us
[1:26:17] that we're going to recognize Jesus
[1:26:19] brother again to believe that it's not
[1:26:22] not our our brother Jonathan or some
[1:26:24] other Ministry brother Ministry or
[1:26:27] brother Mark is not not their Ministry
[1:26:28] it's Jesus
[1:26:30] amen is Jesus giving us the word amen
[1:26:33] because it is it is Jesus that's in the
[1:26:36] ministry God has set in the church
[1:26:39] amen for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:26:42] amen so brother to for God to perfect us
[1:26:47] through the ministry of the word we got
[1:26:48] to recognize and honor and respect the
[1:26:50] ministry amen
[1:26:53] so God help us to do that
[1:26:55] amen thank God Amen for the for the
[1:26:58] ministry of our brother Jonathan thank
[1:27:00] God for the ministry of the other
[1:27:01] brothers amen that have stood behind
[1:27:04] this Pulpit to God be the glory amen
[1:27:07] brother they're going to be surprised
[1:27:08] when we get when when they come to the
[1:27:10] end and they find out they missed this
[1:27:12] they missed that and they wonder why and
[1:27:14] God will show them here
[1:27:17] oh
[1:27:18] that was brother so-so no that was Jesus
[1:27:21] oh that was brother someone said no no
[1:27:23] no that was me that was Jesus
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:27] you Lord yes I was I was speaking to you
[1:27:30] and ministering to you through
[1:27:33] that Ministry
[1:27:34] amen well brother we better take it
[1:27:36] serious
[1:27:38] amen we better take it serious amen
[1:27:42] but down through the years as I've said
[1:27:44] that I've had to deal with much and I've
[1:27:46] had to deal with with with the so-called
[1:27:49] Believers not respecting the ministry oh
[1:27:52] yes and I I and I I've been a bit in in
[1:27:56] pulpits as it were introducing
[1:27:58] Ministries and so on and yes encouraging
[1:28:01] the people to respect that Ministry
[1:28:03] respect the word Amen brother don't look
[1:28:07] at the bat the person look at the word
[1:28:09] pay not pay attention to the person pay
[1:28:12] attention to the word
[1:28:13] amen listen we're not here to find
[1:28:16] fought with brother Jonathan no or if I
[1:28:18] fought my brother Mark what about the
[1:28:20] word
[1:28:21] amen let's respect the word amen
[1:28:25] whether to God be the glory amen
[1:28:29] so brother
[1:28:31] he said again so shall my word be that
[1:28:33] goeth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:28:36] return unto me void amen and going out
[1:28:40] of God's mouth is going out of the
[1:28:42] ministry's mouth
[1:28:44] to believe that it's the anointing of
[1:28:45] the Holy Ghost amen ministering the word
[1:28:49] the anoint of the Holy Ghost is speaking
[1:28:52] to you
[1:28:54] I'm speaking to you
[1:28:57] brother Jonathan wasn't speaking to us
[1:28:59] no no it's the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] he's God
[1:29:03] please in the name of Jesus we come to
[1:29:05] worship Jesus
[1:29:06] amen we come to hear Jesus
[1:29:10] we come to hear his word
[1:29:12] amen amen
[1:29:14] forsake not the Assembly of yourselves
[1:29:16] together and much more as you see the
[1:29:19] day approaching
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] Grace brother
[1:29:25] but the the I think the prophet did say
[1:29:27] sometime long ago I don't know where it
[1:29:28] is now I said if you don't find it if
[1:29:31] you find it tell me but seemed like I
[1:29:33] said it was in he was in in one of his
[1:29:35] message books
[1:29:37] and it was on on this side of the book
[1:29:39] and down down the bottom that I remember
[1:29:42] the prophet of God saying he said the
[1:29:44] hour is coming when he said we should we
[1:29:46] he said when we should meet every night
[1:29:48] oh yeah
[1:29:50] meet every night
[1:29:51] what
[1:29:53] and it was seemed like now services are
[1:29:55] getting less and less
[1:29:57] one time it was every Sunday there was
[1:30:00] two services
[1:30:02] that I when I was raised up brother even
[1:30:04] in denomination they have service Sunday
[1:30:06] morning at 11 o'clock and of course we
[1:30:08] as as young people back then we had
[1:30:11] Sunday school around three o'clock
[1:30:14] yeah in the church and then service
[1:30:17] again at seven o'clock
[1:30:18] oh yeah
[1:30:20] yeah and he got not only that the
[1:30:21] service would if it's seven o'clock it
[1:30:23] would go on to around 12 midnight or one
[1:30:25] o'clock
[1:30:27] in the morning
[1:30:29] Services yes sir that was the kind of
[1:30:32] services we had in the in the
[1:30:33] old-fashioned Salvation Army and I said
[1:30:35] I remember even amen I can remember now
[1:30:38] as I said sitting in a front Pew and uh
[1:30:41] oh I was just a young person sitting
[1:30:44] right at the front Pew and then all of a
[1:30:46] sudden they went on a Jericho March
[1:30:48] oh yeah they did oh yes they they
[1:30:50] started they went on down and went on
[1:30:52] right around the marching they would
[1:30:56] gather at the pulpit first or down at
[1:30:58] the altar and they were worshiping and
[1:31:00] worshiping then they'd line up and go to
[1:31:02] Jericho March
[1:31:03] and and they go up that side and they go
[1:31:05] on out in the into the porch we call it
[1:31:07] and then they come on back again in the
[1:31:09] other door and come on on overall kept
[1:31:11] on going kept on going and I was sitting
[1:31:13] I was set as a young boy sitting in the
[1:31:16] front seat and I remember now that I had
[1:31:18] to pull myself in and pull my legs in
[1:31:20] under the seat amen because they were
[1:31:22] moving around
[1:31:23] going walking around and they were
[1:31:25] singing Onward Christian Soldiers
[1:31:28] amen Martinez to war and praising the
[1:31:31] Lord and praising the Lord you
[1:31:33] experience that even in the Salvation
[1:31:35] Army yes I experienced it in the
[1:31:37] Salvation Army amen experience that even
[1:31:40] even in Pentecost amen the old-fashioned
[1:31:43] Pentecostal church that I attended years
[1:31:44] ago here in St John's amen and they
[1:31:46] would go and go and March and March and
[1:31:49] March and March praising the Lord amen
[1:31:52] tremendous praise the Lord and again
[1:31:54] even in the fellowship with Believers at
[1:31:57] one time they Fellowship a lot more than
[1:31:59] they did now oh yeah grace of God to us
[1:32:03] there's only going to be a few
[1:32:06] please
[1:32:07] be numbered with the few
[1:32:09] amen it's not the many it's not the it's
[1:32:12] not the great big groups it's the little
[1:32:14] groups
[1:32:15] amen that's like the power of God they
[1:32:17] wondered they wondered why in the world
[1:32:19] they said to William Branham they said
[1:32:21] brother why in the world would you would
[1:32:22] you refuse Ministry to this group over
[1:32:25] here and there might be two or three
[1:32:26] thousand and he says you're going to
[1:32:28] minister over to a few people he said
[1:32:29] maybe you know maybe uh three or four
[1:32:31] dozen or something like that and well he
[1:32:34] said the Lord wanted me to go there
[1:32:37] not there
[1:32:39] amen because God God had more freedom
[1:32:41] more Liberty in that little group
[1:32:43] than he did in than he did in the large
[1:32:45] group amen so brother and sister let us
[1:32:49] recognize God as don't don't think oh
[1:32:51] Lord what's wrong we're getting smaller
[1:32:53] we're getting smaller good praise the
[1:32:55] Lord amen straight As the straight As
[1:32:58] the gate Narrows away and few there be
[1:32:59] that find it amen if there's too many if
[1:33:03] there's big crowds oh no no something
[1:33:05] wrong
[1:33:07] exactly brother
[1:33:08] somewhere there's compromise
[1:33:11] amen as and then again all due respect
[1:33:14] and I know there are churches around the
[1:33:16] message and they've got maybe hundreds
[1:33:18] of hundreds of Believers in big churches
[1:33:20] and so on but
[1:33:22] I'll tell you this
[1:33:23] Jesus even when he was here oh yes he
[1:33:26] first when he had his ministry there oh
[1:33:29] at one point there he had he had his 12
[1:33:32] disciples and he had 70. 70 disciples
[1:33:35] following him and wherever he went they
[1:33:38] were there amen yeah
[1:33:40] recognizing his ministry recognizing
[1:33:42] this recognizing that until he spoke the
[1:33:44] word
[1:33:46] amen and they said who can do this who
[1:33:49] can believe this
[1:33:51] and they were and they went away
[1:33:54] and walk no more with him
[1:33:56] amen and Jesus turned to the 12 and said
[1:33:59] will you also go away no he said you got
[1:34:02] the words of eternal life
[1:34:04] they recognize the words of eternal life
[1:34:06] they didn't understand everything even
[1:34:08] what he said they didn't understand it
[1:34:09] but they believed it
[1:34:11] amen even though we don't understand
[1:34:13] everything let's believe it that it is
[1:34:16] God Amen brother so they they went back
[1:34:19] and went on their own way again brother
[1:34:22] God help us stay with the word
[1:34:26] whether you understand this and whether
[1:34:27] you want this and don't want that leave
[1:34:29] it with the Lord and move on if if you
[1:34:32] recognize the word that it is God in his
[1:34:33] word Amen brother and his it's
[1:34:36] increasing your faith in God stay with
[1:34:38] it
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:42] because again remember
[1:34:44] even though the 70 walked away Judas
[1:34:47] stayed
[1:34:50] he stayed
[1:34:52] brother and brother brother Branham also
[1:34:55] said again
[1:34:56] and I was thinking about that very very
[1:34:58] early this morning while I was still in
[1:35:00] bed
[1:35:01] six or seven o'clock six o'clocks for
[1:35:03] sure I think
[1:35:04] and I said Lord where is it where is it
[1:35:06] please I want to find that quote Lord
[1:35:09] and it is he said judaistarians
[1:35:12] he said there it's Jewish terrians in
[1:35:14] the church he said pretended Brothers
[1:35:18] yeah
[1:35:21] and he and he's oh yeah he said they're
[1:35:23] in Hmong Believers yeah Hmong believers
[1:35:27] yeah
[1:35:28] I'm sure I'll try to find that quote you
[1:35:31] can try to find it yeah
[1:35:33] so brother
[1:35:34] Jesus had to deal with it we're dealing
[1:35:36] with it
[1:35:37] that was Jesus back then and he was
[1:35:40] betrayed and he was crucified and Jesus
[1:35:43] and the prophet of God said he said
[1:35:44] there's judaistarians he said in the
[1:35:46] churches today and he said they're there
[1:35:48] and he said for the same thing to betray
[1:35:50] us
[1:35:53] it's not going to be easy
[1:35:57] he was crucified then he's crucified now
[1:36:00] oh what brother Brown yes brother Brown
[1:36:02] preached preached on it you know yes he
[1:36:05] did because the denominations crucified
[1:36:07] it my brother I tell you this
[1:36:09] is going to get even
[1:36:11] more serious
[1:36:13] because there's going to be Jewish
[1:36:15] terrians in in
[1:36:17] around the world
[1:36:19] still professing to be believers
[1:36:22] yeah
[1:36:23] beyond your guard
[1:36:26] amen don't think oh don't worry my
[1:36:29] brother if everything's gonna be fine
[1:36:30] now because we're getting closer to the
[1:36:31] Rapture the closer you get to the
[1:36:33] Rapture brother
[1:36:34] the more you're going to have the
[1:36:36] experience of juditarians
[1:36:39] that'll betray you
[1:36:40] amen
[1:36:42] Judas was right there right there and to
[1:36:45] 24 to take Jesus right out to Calvary
[1:36:49] praise the Lord
[1:36:50] so brother sister I pray the grace of
[1:36:52] God be with us
[1:36:54] stay with the word
[1:36:56] amen take your stand for the word
[1:36:58] regardless of of
[1:37:00] anything negative that you might
[1:37:02] experience among other other believers
[1:37:04] stay with the word
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:08] Jesus stayed Jesus took his dad we got
[1:37:11] to take our stand
[1:37:12] and if Jesus Is With Us Jesus is in us
[1:37:15] we will take our stand we will stay with
[1:37:17] the word amen and listen as Jesus was
[1:37:20] betrayed and crucified we will be to
[1:37:22] betrayed and crucified
[1:37:28] don't think because oh we're Believers
[1:37:30] so we got no worries and we can go
[1:37:31] around the world with Believers and and
[1:37:33] they'll respect us no not necessarily no
[1:37:36] no God help us
[1:37:39] stay with the word
[1:37:41] don't compromise and the thing of it is
[1:37:44] is that there's too many churches are
[1:37:46] compromising
[1:37:49] they're compromising with the world and
[1:37:51] the things of the world
[1:37:52] oh yeah they're getting more and more
[1:37:54] worldly
[1:37:55] oh yeah like the denominations out there
[1:37:59] they're allowing this they're allowing
[1:38:00] it they're focusing more and more on the
[1:38:02] world focusing more and more on the
[1:38:04] things of the world amen God help us
[1:38:09] stay with the word
[1:38:12] amen
[1:38:14] so sorry
[1:38:16] I'm spend an hour already
[1:38:19] but what are thoughts that I want to
[1:38:21] share with you
[1:38:22] oh my
[1:38:25] did we have time for all this
[1:38:29] I don't I don't know
[1:38:31] that's four four messages
[1:38:33] okay and this oh my
[1:38:37] I'll live to just just start I guess and
[1:38:40] then come again on Wednesday and see
[1:38:43] well we can never finish it
[1:38:46] no no way
[1:38:48] amen God bless brother Jonathan if he
[1:38:50] can start to finish your message
[1:38:54] amen
[1:38:55] that'll be good
[1:38:57] but when it comes to starting to finish
[1:38:59] a message you can't do it
[1:39:00] no because boy it come from eternity in
[1:39:04] the time when we're going back to
[1:39:05] Eternity
[1:39:06] so brother there's no there's no way we
[1:39:08] can get away from eternity there's no
[1:39:10] way we can narrow it down not by any
[1:39:12] means you know but to stay stay with the
[1:39:16] word and there's these thoughts that I
[1:39:18] wanted to share with you on the Rapture
[1:39:20] and as I said I preached them a number
[1:39:22] of years ago and I still have oh
[1:39:25] oh
[1:39:29] not enough
[1:39:32] yeah
[1:39:33] so it's quite a few pages but we'll see
[1:39:36] what the Lord will allow us to bring to
[1:39:38] you and minister to you again concerning
[1:39:40] the rapture
[1:39:41] because we're getting closer to the
[1:39:43] Rapture amen and brother God by his by
[1:39:47] the grace and by the ministry of the
[1:39:48] word is focusing more and more on
[1:39:51] rapturing faith and we thank the Lord
[1:39:53] again for the ministry of our brother
[1:39:54] Jonathan and the emphasis he was putting
[1:39:56] on faith faith faith faith
[1:39:59] Because Why without faith it is
[1:40:01] impossible to please him
[1:40:04] amen whether whether it's the faith that
[1:40:06] they've required in the first age or the
[1:40:09] faith in the sixth age but the faith in
[1:40:12] the seventh age under Pentecost but
[1:40:14] brother now we're going on to a bright
[1:40:15] age the crowning of the Pentecostal age
[1:40:18] with a bride message Amen to give us a
[1:40:21] resurrection and a robbery faith
[1:40:24] now brother I'll be honest that
[1:40:26] Pentecost when when they started way
[1:40:28] back a hundred years ago that they they
[1:40:30] felt that they felt that there are some
[1:40:33] of them not all of them felt that what
[1:40:35] God was doing in Pentecostal Revival a
[1:40:37] hundred years ago was going to go on and
[1:40:40] climax with the rapture
[1:40:42] and some of them were right but again
[1:40:45] all of course they were the older ones
[1:40:47] and of course the Lord took them on and
[1:40:49] they they're gone on Amen to their
[1:40:51] reward
[1:40:52] but the Pentecostal
[1:40:55] people they eventually just became
[1:40:57] another denomination
[1:40:59] and so God had to move on to scene again
[1:41:01] to call out from all these organizations
[1:41:04] out of these denominations to call the
[1:41:07] bride
[1:41:08] so brother it's not Pentecost and it's
[1:41:11] it's not the Lutheran or the or the
[1:41:13] methodists or or any of the others but
[1:41:16] no it is the bride Revival let's take
[1:41:19] the bride on to the resurrection take
[1:41:21] the oh God help us please Lord help us
[1:41:24] that we're we're not just getting into
[1:41:25] the letter of the word and Lord your
[1:41:28] Prophet said this your Prophet said that
[1:41:30] but praying Grace oh God that it's
[1:41:31] becoming a revelation to us Lord and
[1:41:34] we're getting a greater and a greater a
[1:41:36] revelation of the Rapture a greater
[1:41:39] revelation of the Resurrection amen
[1:41:42] Brothers
[1:41:44] the lutherans got into what God was
[1:41:46] revealing oh my they were thinking about
[1:41:49] justification but all of a sudden it
[1:41:51] struck them and it became a a Revival in
[1:41:54] their hearts to Revival in their souls
[1:41:56] amen and they would preach it morning
[1:41:59] noon and night justification because it
[1:42:02] struggled amen that Jesus Justified him
[1:42:05] that they didn't have to do this they
[1:42:06] didn't have to do that do this Jesus
[1:42:09] already did it
[1:42:10] and is because we're justified in Jesus
[1:42:13] and of course what what did they think
[1:42:15] they thought that they they had to
[1:42:17] justify themselves they were oh yeah
[1:42:20] that's what Luther was thinking that
[1:42:21] that he would justify himself if he did
[1:42:23] this if he did that if he went here and
[1:42:25] he went there oh and he made many
[1:42:27] Journeys because he thought that oh
[1:42:29] there's a
[1:42:31] if he was going to be justified in the
[1:42:33] presence of God he had to do this he had
[1:42:35] to do that until finally he was so it
[1:42:38] just he just didn't feel Justified
[1:42:41] he was doing this doing that and the
[1:42:43] more he did it this seemed like he still
[1:42:44] wasn't Justified until one day he was so
[1:42:47] frustrated and he was crying unto the
[1:42:49] Lord and to finally and he was walking
[1:42:52] and walking to finally walk into the
[1:42:53] church that he attended and of course
[1:42:56] right in the vestibule thereof there was
[1:42:58] the on on the on the thing there and
[1:43:01] there was a there was a Bible oh and
[1:43:04] Luther went into the church and he he
[1:43:06] was all frustrated and he went over to
[1:43:09] the Bible and opened the Bible oh
[1:43:12] struck him
[1:43:16] did Jesus Justified us
[1:43:19] Jesus
[1:43:22] Justified us
[1:43:24] oh
[1:43:25] and that shock and that brought the
[1:43:27] Lutheran Revival
[1:43:29] and he went preaching that we didn't
[1:43:31] have to do this for justification we
[1:43:34] didn't have to do that for justification
[1:43:35] he said Jesus has already done it
[1:43:38] he said we need the faith
[1:43:40] that we are Justified
[1:43:42] amen and he went and preached that and
[1:43:45] that was the that was the the Lutheran
[1:43:47] Revival amen by the grace of God the
[1:43:51] word of God
