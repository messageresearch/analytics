possible now i believe amen god bless you remain standing and turn with me in your bibles to saint matthew's gospel chapter 22 it's in matthew's gospel chapter 22. amen we'll hear the word of the lord and then go in to hear the prophet of god amen in matthew 22 and verse 1. and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come amazing and again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner amen my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things already come unto the marriage praise the lord but they made light of it don't make light of the word don't make later what god has done and what god is doing amen and it says but but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm and another to his merchandise don't let the natural things of life catch your attention amen let's give our attention to the spiritual the revealed word of god amen the word that's been ordained and predestinated to give us the faith we need amen what is the faith you feel you need amen what is the faith that god wants us to have amen god's looking for looking for to see in you and in me amen brother it's amazing but let's be on our guard because the faith that god is looking for in you and in me is resurrection and rapturing faith amen because amen because that's the thing that god has ordained and god has predestinated amen to bring the past now in these last days so be on your guard be on your toes believe the word amen but believe the word that god has revealed believe the word that god is revealing amen brothers look for that word to come to pass look let's be expecting the resurrection let's be expecting the rapture by the grace of god amen and it says verse 6 and the remnant took his servants and entered them spitefully and slew them or entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city and then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy grace to us go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage so these servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in ether not having a wedding garment and he was speechless amen brother make your calling and election sure make sure you got the wedding garment amen praise the name of the lord regard called unto a marriage supper of the lamb by the grace of god and verse 12 and he saith unto him friend how came us thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless and then said the king to the servants bind him and and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen amen and the message the prophet is going to minister on is one in a million amen brother is not the impression that we were left with down through the ages in one revival after another and we thought oh not one in a million there's gonna be a million in a billion amen maybe that out of this age of that age and that age there's gonna be a million amen that god's gonna choose that god's going to call to the marriage supper of the lamb no many are called but few are chosen amen because god's looking at your heart the call goes forth by the word the call goes forth through the word but god's looking at your response to the word god's looking at your your feeling concerning the word amen your attitude toward the word oh praise the lord i understand this brother when it comes oh well this brother he's got all these good deeds he does this he's good he's good what is it in his heart amen because a person can be as good as anything when it comes to the the things of the flesh they do this they do that but brother what about any what the love of god in their heart do they really really really have it in their heart do they really appreciate the word in their souls do they really appreciate god in their hearts amen do they really appreciate one another in their hearts amen so brother that's what god's looking at right now he's looking at your heart amen it's not your head and and not necessarily what even what even what i'll say and and i'll all respond and all i'll react and so i know looking for a reaction but he he wants to see it in the heart he wants to hear it in the heart amen so brother we're going to praise the lord is it is it out of our heads or out of our hearts amen amen so i pray grace brother when we praise the lord we're responding to the word amen amen amen out of the heart that's what god's looking for amen because too many it's just out of their heads oh yeah intellectually but brother god wants it spiritually from your soul amen it shows that amen brother i'm not into this physically i'm into it spiritually praise the lord you you bring the physical subject to the spiritual amen don't let the physical take control the spiritual no no you let the spiritual take control the physical amen let's believe god out of our hearts oh no brother not just out of the head because there's many that believe god under their heads but they're they're going to hell oh yeah but god's looking for the faith in the heart grace to us this is why brother that in these last days there's going to be one in a million why because one in a million believe in the heart others just got it in their heads others got it in their in their bodies in their physical beings oh yes i believe this oh thank you lord wonderful i feel this i we're not going by feelings we're going by faith not what you feel is what you sense in your heart your soul by the grace of god amen so again he said then said the king to the servants bind him and foot those that were those that never had the proper garment a wedding garment bind them hand and foot and take them away and cast them into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen and we trust by grace we're numbered with the chosen amen he has called but chosen from among all that god is called we that brother god recognizes our faith in our hearts not not oh lord i believe this i believe that no you do you you believe it so does the devil but brother god's looking for faith in the heart amen so god help us to believe from the heart and as we go into the word we pray grace to hear it from the heart and in your heart and the lord by grace that the lord will give us the faith of the revealed word in your heart you're going to really appreciate this not in your head but in your heart amen so grace as we go into one in a million april 24 1965 so god bless you you may be seated amen praise the lord brother good morning friends certainly good to be here in los angeles again this morning prior to this great convention and the oncoming meeting of this coming week over at the embassy hotel i'm expecting to see you all over there and we'll all under a great expectations to meet our lord jesus and see him over there he promised that he would be wherever two or three was together together he would be there and i'm sure that i met him this morning as i come up the steps here in this auditorium when all the people with great anticipations waiting for the breakfast and the speaking and it's good to be gathered here with you and uh to the radio audience there's so many in here there i had to go down the next floor and speak to a few and seen so many requests heart trouble and different ailments of their bodies and we're here now to pray for the sick and the afflicted justice got top the steps i'm looking at the old gentleman now he came up to me and said brother brown years ago he said he had heart trouble so bad that he they thought he was going to die i had prayer for him and grace of god healed him and here he is this morning way in his 80s just rejoicing so that makes us take new hope and now i'm certainly soliciting the prayers of the people out in the radio land as well as here actually this meeting i'm going to europe down into africa and around all meetings and uh this is going by a vision so it's going to be a great meeting there i'm sure i've felt for years that the lord has warned me to come back the little humbly humble ministry that he gave me i don't think he's quite finished with it yet over there it seemed like there might be a soul somewhere that i could catch in the gospel net the one that he's given me to sing for the people a way of in divine healing praying for the sick and i certainly solicit your prayers for you people hearing them or out in the radio audience i don't have time to take a text and preach which i expect you to after a few minutes here in the the auditorium but just to speak and to you a few moments to get acquainted and to the people out in the land i'm going to have prayer for those out there right away and you're here also and i'm certainly glad to meet all these fine new friends that i have never met before just come in contact with them this morning we've been having great times in the services and other places i don't get out too much anymore it's so busy we just got to keep the road hot between jeffersonville indiana and tucson arizona where we moved out there a few years ago by a vision of the lord that sent us out there to not knowing where i was going and many of you heard clifton's i spoke to you a little before left in a phoenix meeting of a vision that had come of seeing seven angels in a cluster i know to the radio audience perhaps many of you are not full gospel and this may seem a little mysterious to you which it would to me but there is anyone who can explain anything you don't have to accept it anymore by faith it's things that we cannot explain that we have to accept by faith we cannot explain god no man can explain god he's sovereign he's great mighty we just we just accept it because we know he's there and then by our faith in accepting it he brings a response back to us as a baptism of the holy spirit which i'm just going to speak to you about in a few moments a year on god's way our place of worship and the only place that you can worship him the only place he'll ever meet you they've got is one church one place one time one people and all that god meets and it's i hope that the lord blesses the message to your heart now coming to tucson it was strange those visions speaking to you in the name of the lord not one of them as i ever can recall blast anyone else they could recall any time that he ever did say anything but what was the truth it always happens just the way he says it will happen and he's supposed to according to the scriptures return to us in this last days and this type of ministry that'll be after the baptism of the spirit and speaking in tongues and divine healing and so forth these things the capping of the pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today this ministry of the christ himself impersonated among his people with the very same things that he did when he was here on earth in his body the bride which is part of him doing the same things his husband and wife are king and queen just before the marriage ceremony this week the lord willing i wish to speak some on that out in uh our campaign here at the embassy hotel and kind of get acquainted and my humble way of doing it the the time and the hour that we're living if a person don't know which way to go what to do or how to turn you're not walking by faith anymore you're just guessing you're pursuing and pursuing is to it to advance without official authority so if we haven't got the real official authority to know what god said would take place in this hour how are we ever going to face this hour and we've got to face it knowing by faith in his word the things that's supposed to be happening now and the condition of the nations the condition of the people condition of the church and so forth we got to know that and then how to walk out to face it if you don't know how to do that you're just just what we used to call kind of haphazardly just jumping hoping to be here hoping this and hoping that and will it be but god don't want us to do that he wants us to know what he has said about this day and then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way and we we know your truth then because you haven't got some person's word for it you got his word of what we must do and we're hoping that our heavenly father will will grant this to us this week now i'm sorry that i cut off of what i was saying a few moments ago about coming to tucson and i thought myself that it was the end of my life i thought no one could ever stand that shock of that condition that happened in that vision that morning about 10 o'clock at home that would ever be able to live after that well i come to tucson making arrangements with uh my son for my wife and and children to go with him after i was gone because i thought it was my end and i and phoenix demanded meetings before it happened i told you just how it would happen well a few months after that i was up in sabina canyon one morning which is just north of tucson i was up there to pray and while i was praying i had my hand up in the air and saying father i pray thee that thou will and somehow help me give me strength for the hour that i'm now facing and if my work is finished here on earth then i must come to you and it's not as i regret coming but i know that you'll take care of my family and i i'm just asking for strength for this hour and something struck my hand now radio audience this may seem strange i have said but it's the truth and god is my judge i looked at my hand and there was a sword uh had a sheath over the handle part and the handle itself was made of pearl this looked like kind of a gold-like guard over the handle part and the the knife itself looked rather like it was kind of shiny like oh something like chrome or something glistening in the sun now it's about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning way on top of a mountain you can imagine how a person uh feel that i'm in my right mind would feel standing there with a sword from nowhere people for miles and miles holding that in your hand i felt of it tucked and waved the blade back and forth and why it was a sword and i looked and i said well now how could that ever happen here i am standing here right here and no one around for miles and miles and where did that come from i said well i i suppose maybe it's the lord telling me it's my end time and a voice spoke and said this is the sword of the lord and i thought well a sword then is sent for like a king tonight you know how i used to do in england and different places i thought that's what that is for tonight and uh i thought well maybe i'm supposed to lay hands on people over i had all kinds of human mind can be all messed up you know you don't know our minds is finite his is infinite so and as it then it left my hand and i didn't know where it went just disappeared well if a person didn't understand a little bit about spiritual things you you'd go crazy like that you'd be standing there wondering what happened and he said the vision is not your end time it's for your ministry that sword is the word the seven seals will be open those mysteries of and then two weeks after that or two months rather after that i was up in the mountain with a bunch of friends when it happened seven angels just as clear as you're standing here came sweeping down from heaven the rocks in the mountains rolled out and down the hills and people standing there was screaming and going on in order dust flying everywhere and when it was he said return to your home now will be each angel will be one of the seals of the seven seals which is on tape and the book will be out pretty soon then now it's kind of grammarized as you know my grammar is not very good people wouldn't you just have to be people that love me and know how to understand me on my grammar but uh some theologian is grammarizing for me and um taking out all the the uh well maybe i said the wrong word there i don't even know so i heard someone laughing so i guess that grammarize wasn't right but like the dutchman you take me for what i mean and not what i say baby and it's uh just uh three minutes now i'm told until the uh closing of the program now you dear people out in a radio land and use it sick and needy here in the audience would you just lay your hands on each other now while we have this word of prayer for the sake now jesus said his last commission to the church these signs shall follow them that believe them them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover their heavenly father we're like children today we're obeying what you said do we are laying hands upon all these telephone requests thou seest them out in the land out there how they're needy the suffering you see those here that are needy suffering and we are committing them to thee dear god with this faith in thy word that thou hast said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover granted lord in jesus christ's name amen [Music] thank you brother it's certainly a grand privilege to be back again on the broadcast to speak to some of our friends out and the radio land as well as present here and we're certainly extending this invitation to you to come to the embassy hotel tomorrow afternoon to be prayed for and not only that but to bring the ones that sinners and those who are backslidden if we just have a prayer for the sick and we do see god constantly doing great miracles but that's secondarily the main thing is to be saved filled with god's spirit which i'm going to speak to you about just in a few moments here and the sufficiency how that we must be filled with god's spirit and divine healing usually draws an attention to people and brings them in the presence of god when god does something that they know is on well it's not understood we cannot mechanically show how it's done god does it in his own great way then that attracts the attention of the people to know that there's a presence of a power somewhere that can do something as beyond human understanding and that causes them to look to the lamb of god and always divine healing i've been told and i believe myself that about between 60 maybe 70 of our lord's ministry was on divine healing and he did that to attract the people then when they were there he said except you believe i am he you will perish in your sin now divine healing is a great drawing card to get people to look to the lord jesus and dr ff boss which many of your was a friend to and knew him and his ministry meant so much to me as a young minister i started out in my meetings now i run into brother bosworth he used to say divine healing it's a cruel little statement now he says divine healing is the bait on a fish hook that you never show the fish the hook you show you the bait and then he just adds the bait and gets on the hook so that's what we try to do that's our uh we our aim is to get people to the lord jesus christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he was a healer in the days gone by he's the healer today uh just a personal testimony before i pray for the sick out in the radio land it was a few days ago i was setting up in a mountains where a great thing had taken place before a 15 or 20 breath are in there where the angel lord came so down and great light flying like a comet bursting around through the mountains and rocks flying for 200 feet or more across there cutting the top of the trees out and i was standing right under and told him just a few months before it happened it would be there and what would happen frankly it was told the day before and all these men running under trucks and everything trying to get away they didn't know why it's taken place and he spoke and said what would take place right immediately afterwards sitting on this certain rock there right where he had appeared i had a friend that was with us that had come down from up minnesota his people are here this morning and i'm not sure but what he may be here on some of the other floors it was donovan works and a fine young fellow lutheran that had just given his life to christ and been filled with the spirit very humble german boy about 30 years old family two three little children he moved down to tucson just being neighbors with me were three or four hundred moved in to be neighbors so we i'm glad to have such neighbors as that they followed me always from south africa and everywhere around this to be near to see the with me and to be with me and enjoy the pleasures of the lord such a humble fellow i never noticed him very much of course the people i know and associate with are just like my own brother sister i watch them and see if i think they're getting out of line and take them out to one side and talk with them because i love them we want to live in glory together and sometimes maybe in the meetings you think i speak harsh to you that isn't from that isn't the cause that i don't love yet but it does come from my heart because i i it must be just one way there's only one way to serve god and we must stay in his way no matter what our thoughts is his way and i noticed donovan on the right tip of his ear was swollen perhaps three times its size and looked very red well not thinking maybe that there in the desert uh for a few days that where we've been maybe he had gotten some cactus in his ear but uh taking a hold of his hand i found out it was a cancer so i said to donovan i said donovan uh have you how long has that been on your ear just can't throw him off like i didn't know i said how long has i been on there at donovan he said brother branham about six months he said i said why didn't you mention it to me he said oh seems so busy so i didn't want to to do it said i just thought maybe sometime the lord might tell you so uh i said do you realize what it is he said i have a good idea i said that is right and the second morning no more than that holding the boy by the hand the second morning there wasn't even a scar on his ear it was all completely gone so many times we pressed and trying to get to this that er see [Music] it's these signs shall follow the believer it didn't say if they pray for the sick if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover we must have faith ourselves in what we're doing all right so now donovan is probably here you'll meet him he'll be here if he isn't here this morning on some of the other floors you'll meet him and he'll know the testimony and what more could i say as believe luke or john once said uh the world couldn't conhold contain the books that could be written of what he's done among the people in this last days how six been healed alcoholics delivered by the thousands of them and all kinds of diseases and afflictions now you out in radio land as well as here i'm holding here now a great handful of requests has come in by the phone this morning constantly ringing since we've been here and so we uh 196 requests has come in this morning by the phone since we've been in here so let us join in prayer now as each one wherever you are out in the land lay your hands on one another if you're believers if not lay your hand upon the bible or something out there while we pray here and there dear heavenly father a little testimony of donovan works just one of the thousands lord that thou has so graciously i pray that you'll look down into the hearts of the people both here and in radial land and may the everyone be healed may the evil one lead them and may they be delivered from all their afflictions granted father in the name of jesus christ our son we asked him amen [Music] well this is three times for me up here this morning and you know they're just told that we got to vacate the building in about 12-14 minutes or something and the management said this on the other floor then they can't serve any meals our meals lengthened out we have many courses you know so we're very very glad that we have had this great spiritual gastronomical jubilee you know i would call it this morning here with this fine bunch a man i'd like to to make mention that we are the services again tomorrow afternoon or the embassy now we will be praying for the sick there and expecting god to meet with us and i've come to put in my part my ministry into making all that we can this meeting to be a success not a success because it's our meeting a success of people finding jesus christ that's a success any meetings no matter how much we praise god how many great things that we see him do how many times he speaks to us in the spirit and so forth unless there's something accomplished some souls brought into the kingdom and uh brothers carrying out we just made a real statement just now about what he thought about these days that we're we're living in i truly believe that with all my heart that we're living just at the closing time just in a just in the evening shadows the sun is far advanced and when we see things taking place the way they are today why it's hard telling what another generation would bring a few days ago just let me give you a little insight something uh they made an analysis throughout arizona where i live of all the schools that gave the children unknowingly to them a mental test and guess what including high schools and and grammar school there was 80 percent of the children suffering with mental deficiency seventy percent of them was television watchers the evils it just slipped up on us and we don't you wonder why it comes you can hear the voice of god screaming out against it yet here we we find ourselves webbed into it let me give you a shocking something see not all this says unto me lord lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father his will is his word we can be ever so religious have great time shouting jumping in these meetings which we're i don't i don't want to be critical but i have a a duty to do to god and that duty is to be sincere and to say what he wants me to say and i'm i'm certainly grateful for the california chapter who's bore with me and and my convictions if i don't speak my convictions i'm a hypocrite i'm not i'm not even honest with you and if i can't be honest with you how will be honest with god because i'll see you and talk to you of course we do to god too but we got to be really sincere and honest with one another we are certainly in a a horrible horrible age and did you ever stop just let me give you just a little analysis not all that saith unto me lord lord will enter therein but the one that doeth the will of my father jesus said on earth man shall not live by bread alone but by every word every word not just now and then a word but by every word it was one word misbelief by gods of god's commandments that caused death sorrow and ever sickness and heartache to miss god's word one word if he'd taken the human race into death by this misbelieving one word surely surely but he said it would happen satan said surely it won't but it did so we've got to keep every word of god and if the human all this suffering and things that went on the human race by misconstruing or are misbelieving one word how we going back by missing one if it's cost all this price even the life of his son many are called you're chosen many are called few are chosen i can't take a text from this but because we haven't got time but just to leave something with you let us think of i went one day with brother shakarian you know when his high breeding cattle and i've seen the the in the laboratory where brother shakarian take him in and they in the sperm of the male cow uh just uh a little like a little instrument matched them and took up a bunch of that sperm and put it under this glass that magnified it hundreds of times and there was little germs jumping in that and that sperm which we know the germ comes from the male and the eight from the female and i asked the chemist there and i said what's that making that little jump like he said that's uh that's little bulls and calves see i said in that little drop he said yes i said perhaps then in the entire spurn there would be a million of them he said oh yes now watch close now when this great thing takes place there's one egg waiting for one germ out of that million and there's no one can tell which germ that is or which age that is if you'd watch the natural birth it's more of a mystery than the than the virgin birth because in the sperm there's one in there that's predestinated to live and the rest of them will die and it isn't the first one meets it's the first one that comes together with the egg maybe the egg may raise up from the back of the spur in the middle of the sperm the germ may do the same they the germ crawls into the egg and little tails drop off of it and there starts the spine there's only one and that whole load of a million that's going to make it only one and that's determined by some unknown forced demand that you're everyone alike every one of those germs are just a light same thing an animal same thing in man it's determined where it's going to be boy girl redheaded blackhead or white is determined by god all of them look the same naturally but there's one in there that's ordained to life one in a million yet all of them alike when israel left egypt there was approximately two million people left at the same time every one of them heard the message of a prophet every one of them saw the pillar of every fire of us baptized the moses in the red sea every one of them shouted in the spirit beat the tamarins and run up and down the bank with maryam when moses sang in the spirit there everyone drank from the same spiritual rock they everyone eat fresh manna every night every one of them but there was two made the land one out of a million what was the test they all drinking the same rock they all eat the same spiritual man as we eat this morning but the word test proved him when it comes to the time of katie sparnia when they start over into the promised land and they could not go over until they was tested by the word and all the the other ten came back and said we can't make it the people are like we're like grasshoppers to them they're great walls cities the opposition is too great but joshua and caleb steal the people they say we're more than able to do it why god said before they left the promised land i've given you the land i'll give it to you it's yours but there were one out of each million there's approximately 500 million so-called christians in the world today and each day ends a generation and now what if the rapture would come today and 500 people universally would be taken in the rapture you never know or even see in the paper them going and the coming of the lord is a secret coming you'll come and steal away you'll be such a minority so just like it was in the days when the disciples asked jesus why does the scribe say that that elias must first come he said he's already come and you never knew it did you ever think what the people did they went right on believing that elias was coming and he was right among them and they didn't know it so will it be in the coming of the son of man he'll do with him just the same thing the spirit of god is here well what are we going to do with it are we going to eat manna and so forth and not continually move up as we grow did you ever notice a seed as the reverend pitts was speaking a few moments ago and how seed goes into the ground many seeds are there in the ground when god moved upon the water with the light and light brought forth the first presence of god spoken light chained by god's word and god's word is the only thing that still brings light and when the waters went back the seed is already in the earth and the light only brought forth the seeds that remain with germ in them come forth god making his creation and now on easter morning there was another light struck the earth when the holy spirit was given and it's given to bring life to those seeds that god by his foreknowledge knew that would be here on the earth as he knew the first natural seed he knows where the spiritual season your body was laying here right down on the earth when god first brought the earth into existence we are a part of the earth we were laying there and by his foreknowledge he knew exactly who would love him and who would serve him and who would not his foreknowledge tells that if it doesn't then he isn't god he can't be god without being infinite and if he's infinite he knows all things amen so you see people making their blunders they stumble at it they run at it they think this and that but it doesn't work right we see it but there is a working right that's to find god's perfect will and standing in what god calls you for as brother jack said a few moments ago about down here at the the persian square all the confusion one this away in one that way and about the theologians and so forth that you want to know some theology go down there i guess that's just about like it is the hyde park in london i was down there everybody has his own idea it's a it's a conglomeration of of a modern day world in babylon amen but did you notice as brother pitts went on with his lovely message this morning to us as he began to walk out of the park there he found a little easter lily in the midst of all the confusion as he brought it to us that had no way to say yes or no it was a life of god shining in it in the midst of all the confusion it was there in its radiance because god had ordained it to be there in the midst of all the conflict no one was noticing it they didn't see the spiritual application of it and so easily today amongst all of our great gatherings and groups and churches and denominations and so forth one pulling this away we must be baptized and be presbyterian we must be this side of the other in the midst of all of it there is a growing flower there is a power of god right among us being raised right up in the midst of all of us let's just stop and behold it a few minutes and watch it this week and see it unfold right before us we believe god will do it don't you [Music] i see it we ought to be downstairs but now so let's pray each one of us dear god when we bow our heads in thy presence we are feel that we are so insufficient to ask but you promised us that if we would come you would not turn us down and these rude statements that's just been made by no means to be a doctrine one out of a million but just to kind of remember or you said straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there will be that'll find it or many are called but few are chosen o eternal father send the gospel light across this city through this coming week of convention and if there be any seed somehow by your own great wise province like trying to illustrate it in the spurn of the male and female may they roll into the convention may the holy spirit give them life we realize that the time is perhaps later than we think it is we pray god that as we come here just believing that maybe there is something here that could be done that would help the people or or catch that last sheep we know when the sheep fold is full then the shepherd will close the door as it was like in the days of noah when the last member of the family was brought in god closed the door and they beat and pounded but it was too late dear god they had the opportunity you said i am that door to the sheephole and how striking the song from the poet are not ninety and nine enough for thee but no there was one more he might be a little black sheep or he might be a little nobody might be the little her he we don't know where they are but that last one must come in and then the door will be closed oh god who knows all things search our lives this morning and send us wherever that we could go that we might find that last one that the door will be closed and the shepherd inside with the sheep granted lord if there be that one here today if that one that's supposed to come in all the father has given me will come to me and no man can come except my father has drawed him and if there be a tug or a little feeling that this might be the hour for somebody here in this audience here are downstairs or wherever they may be may they answer yes lord i am that little wandering one that's wandered away it's fallen off all my life i i felt that i should come but today i'm hanging on the side of the peak i can't go up or down i can go no way oh may the great shepherd come reach down with tender hands and bring that one safely in place it up on his shoulders and bring it safely back maybe there is one here laura that's sick in a similar condition that the doctor said there's nothing can be done he tried hard to rescue it but he could not rescue it it's beyond his reach there's there's nothing that he can do his medicine or his knife cannot get to it oh lord there's nothing too far for your great arm and your word is your arm so we pray dear god that this morning while we are talking to thee that thou will reach down and pick that one up that's sick it cannot help itself out of the reach of all scientific uh matters away from the doctor may they be healed granted lord as we think of david as he was given a charge over a few sheep just a few but one day a bear come in and got that one little sheep and tuck it out and would have eaten up like a cancer would eat up a body our huge line but david not too well equipped with a a rifler and not a swordsman but with only a slingshot he went after that sheep and when he found the animal that was about to kill the little sheep he slew it with the slingshot just a simple little weapon with a piece of leather and a string and but he had confidence in it we have no great genius among us lord we're simple people with a simple little prayer but we're coming this morning after father's sheep that woman that has walked the streets miserably smoking cigarettes trying to find peace through the cigarette that man who has smelt the glass and tries to set it back but the enemy holds him tight that boy or girl that's tried to do right just can't find strength to break away from the wrong thing we come in the name of the lord jesus to claim that sheep this morning we defy the enemy because it's a simple thing a slingshot of prayer but we're coming to bring that one back to the father's home that we might give an account of those things that's been committed to our hands may the power of god now strike faith down in the hearts of the people and may that lost soul return this morning may the temptations of this life turn him away let him go may he find himself safely upon the master's shoulders being carried back to safety again we asked it in jesus name amen god bless you all i'll see you tomorrow i'll turn this service to brother chicarion this i hope that you that i found more grace than the sight of god and before you to believe that i'd stand here to tell you something that was wrong i was past my 56th birthday the other day this isn't just an old man's message i believe this since i was a little boy and if this isn't true i've been the most foolish person god had on the earth i've given my entire life for this cause and may i say this with sincerity if i had ten thousand lives i never changed my opinion now healing is in reach of every person remember healing is in you god placed in the peach tree every peach that would ever be in it when he planted it in the garden see you just the peach tree of the apple tree the fruit tree just has to grow from drinking the water in the earth now each one of you has those potentials in you to deliver you or it is god since you've been planted into christ by baptism not water baptism spiritual baptism you don't come into christ by water baptism by spiritual baptism tomorrow afternoon the lord willing i'm speaking on that how and what is the real application of it we have in the afternoon so we'll interfere with any of your services now look each one of you here is standing as believers see then the life that was in christ is in you okay if you could just sit it's a devil's business keep you blocked off from that keep you blinded penis let you be blind and that's see you don't know where you're going then a man that's blind cannot tell where he's going he's got to seek the understanding from somebody who can see until we can understand somebody's got to tell us what's truth and christ died for you and you are transplanted from the world into christ and everything you have need of is right in you by the baptism of the holy ghost isn't that right now the only thing you have to do is just start drinking from that as the tree drinks it begins to push out its leaves its buds pushes out its fruit each year the fruit's not in the ground the fruit is in the plant how many understand that say amen the fruit is in the plant and every plant has to drink from his fountain as a rain comes down gives that plant life to drink from and as it drinks it grows it's growing up until it comes to the full blood just like the church has to bloom out in this age and as we drink we grow if the plant refuses to drink then the plant cannot grow and if you just believe it now individually of course you know how the lord does show different things of what you've done and what you should not have done and so forth in the meeting was hoping that the holy spirit would fall upon us this morning and do such as we stood by kept waiting i think it's a nervous part thinking it downstairs to hold us out of here see but they're wanting us we're late now but believe this with all your heart please do if i if i found grace in your sight as a truthful person believe this i'll put your hands on each other now look now the bible didn't say these signs will follow william brown didn't say the follower or roberts only didn't say the father brother copper or somebody these signs shall follow damn plural that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover it's that power of god that's in you that brings to life to the person you got your hand on the life giving source of the holy ghost dear god in the name of jesus christ in this crucial moment when the church may they stand at this second without nervousness may the power that raised up christ from the grave quicken to them just now the truth of the gospel that jesus commission was if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover may ever demon power ever sickness every disease every affliction every tormenting thing that's happened to the people may at least just now by faith as believing people we asked it in jesus christ's name amen now raise your hands and give him praise if you believe that he doesn't dear god this baby will die lord unless this is done i condemn this not in the name of jesus christ may leave the innocent child amen uh the doctors is trying the faith amen praise the lord just think that's not just one sermon but william brought him that was three i think amen so thank the lord and it was uh again it was printed as as one in in this little booklet here and uh and of course it's referred to as one in a million and it was broadcast that brother bannon was was highlighting amen so we thank god for the word we thank god for the revelation of the things that he was sharing with us and sharing with those back in 1965 and again it was around easter time in april the 24th so thank god for the revelation to put us on our guard concerning one in a million because straight is the gate narrows the way and few there be that find it so understand that trust brother please let's seriously consider the challenge to our faith just don't assume that oh well you know one in a million yeah so we're numbered we're going to be there just make your calling and election sure amen so humble yourself to be more and more and more sincere to the lord more and more sincere to the message more and more sincere to one another amen let's brother sister let us truly make our calling election sure make sure that we've got the the baptism and the anointing of the holy ghost so that it is christ in me it is christ in you amen we're here not because of we had thoughts in our mind and we believe this we believe that and we're influenced by religious spirit no no no it's it's the holy ghost in me and i'm a new creature in christ amen and the nature of the new creature oh we just we want what what we want to do we want a fellowship around the word oh yes as the bible says forsake not the assembly of yourselves together much more as you see the day approaching and i'll tell you

mercy lord and and and encourage encourage them strengthen them lord but no jesus oh my jesus said just oh his heart went out to the family his art went out to the to the parents of this young man that was that was that they were taken out to be buried oh yeah but jesus went over and laid his hands on him and raised him up amen and turned him over to his mother this is amazing absolutely
