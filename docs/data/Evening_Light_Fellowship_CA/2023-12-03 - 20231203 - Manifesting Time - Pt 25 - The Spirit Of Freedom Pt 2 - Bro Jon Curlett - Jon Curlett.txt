want to just let it lay there Lord but we want to pick up the the sword of the spirit which is the word of God this morning and Lord we want to see freedom in our lives Lord we want to see Deliverance Lord we want to see salvation ation we want to see the Holy Ghost In Action Lord in each and every one of our lives this morning Lord Body Soul and Spirit Lord so we're giving ourselves a new to you this morning Lord we're laying it all on the altar Lord we're giving every bit of us Lord every thought every idea every opinion Lord every part of it Lord we're giving to you this morning and say Lord have your way in our lives Lord let your word be manifested Lord let the the reality of God be in our body soul in spirit this morning Lord in a greater and more powerful way Lord would you speak to us once again Lord those that aren't here Lord we pray your special Grace to them Lord but those that are here Lord may we be blessed Lord as your word would go forth Lord as your presence quickens us to it Lord may we be changed Lord even in this service we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 amen enjoy the song service this morning man good to be home and I enjoy going away and getting out in the woods and there's virtually no internet connection and there's no emails and no work but uh I'm also glad to be back you know I'm a home body I like to be where where I always am and so glad to be back here amen certainly appreciate the prayers had an interesting trip on the way out I had a SUV in the in the night swerving into my lane which was interesting but uh by God's grace he moved back or they moved back so I don't know if they fell asleep or were on their phone or whatnot but God protected me there and then I was able to go out and see brother Doug and sister Beverly and it rained almost the whole time going there and back especially at nights dangerous but he preserved me amen got to spend some time fellowshipping with them got to see brother back Samson went to see of course brother Barry and sister darling guy they let me use their cabin and their equipment for my hunt so we really appreciate that got to see brother Ivan Brenton as well as well and please remember him in prayer you know the doctors say it's just a matter of time for his wife and that's that's tough on him he's been married 54 years no children with her so it's the end of a road really for that relationship and we know it doesn't end here amen but you're you're left with a sense of loss so we want to remember him he's asked me to to handle the the funeral if and when it comes to that so just uh remember them and then I got to spend most of Thursday with brother Hank and sister Vera snow had a wonderful time of fellowship with them so I was very grateful for that and they'd mentioned how much how much they'd enjoyed spending time brother Mark and sister Moren when they were there recently so you know these Saints they need Fellowship you know brother Doug and sister Beverly the pretty much the only ones out there on the west coast and I was talking to them about that and just saying what an encouragement it is for for the younger ones to see people that stand and there's nobody else left it's just them but they stand there and they're faithful and and and they just are expressing the word of God for this age you know so remember those Saints and in prayer certainly but uh it was a good time and of course we did get the Moose as well so so it was a good trip amen as God was very gracious and I was thankful to to get that opportunity to certainly be with the Saints but also to to get an animal as well so we thank God for that amen Let's uh continue this morning now in the service Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 Paul says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the know of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe it's only for the believer church you've got to believe it says according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above not just above far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and ha put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church now I want you to catch this last verse because it says the church which is his body now it said in verse 22 that he has put all things under his feet and then it says who's his body it says the church is so that means that everything is under you I don't care if you're the lowest believer this morning I don't care if you're the rough scaly skin on the bottom of Christ's feet everything is under your feet because you're part of him amen there's nothing that can stand before you everything every Power every principality every might every Dominion every name that is named is under your feet this morning he says which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we're continuing on our series and manifesting time and I want to take a second service on this thought on the spirit of freedom and I'm really enjoying this it's it's good to come in and you know you lay in the teaching and you you lay in the structure but now we're getting into the benefit side now we're getting into the the blessing side of the believer and I was looking at my notes last night and I've got 42 pages of notes on this and I don't know how much I can bring before it starts to sound the same amen but I I love to read about the good things of God I love to read about what God has in store for those that love him amen and so I want to bring another message of Freedom this morning and I want to say one thing this morning if you're a child of God you're free if there's one thing that defines us it's that we're free you know and and we can say you know I don't feel like I'm free you know I look at my life and I look at what I'm struggling with and I I look at I've got financial difficulties and I've got health issues and I've got faults and failures and and and relationship issues and job issues and all these things I didn't say you felt free I said you are free and man that's what we forget so many times is that our feelings are determining what we are and it's not based on our feelings it's based on what the word declares for us brother Braham says this he says it's with you tonight unconditionally he's laying it in their lap now he says if you become a Christian every Redemptive blessing of God belongs to you now not not as a group he says it's your personal property you got to put your name there he puts your name there you got to be able to read your name there and realize it's not just for the one that got healed but it's for you it's not for just the one whose children got saved it's for your children that need to get saved it's not for us for that one that got the Holy Ghost it's for you that needs the Holy Ghost amen that everything that he has promised you is your personal property as a son or daughter of God this morning he says you got a right to claim it if you let Satan push you over in the corner well that's up to you he says but brother stand up there toet to Toe with this scripture and say it is written that's right that's the way your Lord did it and any man I don't care you might be a weak Christian you might be a weak Christian this morning he says but you don't need people coming through with gifts of healing you don't need those things the only thing you do too is take God at his word and stand toet to Toe with Satan you'll defeat him on the ground so what he's saying is if you're bound this morning you'll be as bound as you're willing to be bound that it's up to you how much you're willing to go if you think that that that you want to stay there then you can stay there but if you want to get free then you're you can be set free this morning he's already declared it amen you'll stay sick as long as you want you'll stay depressed as long as you want you'll stay overweight as long as you want you'll stay poor as long as you want you'll stay discontented as long as you want but when you say I don't want to be this way anymore now you've got an opportunity to be free but as long as you want it as long as you're willing as long as you allow it as long as you'll deal with it Satan's got room he's got permission to stay there but when you say enough's enough Satan's got to go brother B would say this because what we've got a fountain we've got a fountain this morning and it's a NeverEnding Fountain and it's up to you whether or not you drink you know they got that old saying you you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink it's up to you this morning do you want to drink not just do you want to drink how much do you want to drink it's up to you how much you take in this morning brother said there's been much mockery in every phase of religion but there is a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the human being from the bondage of sin he says there's a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the sufferer from his suffering it's not just words it's not just theology it's not just Doctrine but there's a reality in the Holy Ghost that's available for the believer today amen the amazing thing about Believers is we can be in the same situation as somebody next to us and have a completely different Outlook we can have a completely different attitude we can have a completely different approach we can feel different we can act different we can say different even though we're in the exact same condition and it's because we are free that conditions don't determine circumstances don't determine the way that we act the way we think in these different things amen but we all have to walk through life you know brother Hank was telling me while I was away he said brother John he says my life is already on the film It's Already Done God has already determined the way your life goes he said and all I've got to do is walk through it it's already there the film's already there we've said it before that that old Cathedral song I've read the back of the book and we win I've seen the movie we win in the end but you still got to go through the book you still got to go through the movie but if you know the end then you can walk in the middle and you can walk through these hard times with confidence knowing that the end is already determined and we win amen we get our healing we get our deliverance we get our body change we get the Holy Ghost we get salvation we get all of these things that God has promised to the church this morning amen what Freedom means is that none of it can hold us back we're looking to the end we're looking to the author and the finisher of our faith to say you've already declared what's going to happen and so I'm free even though I'm fighting I'm free even though I'm struggling I'm free even though there's a battle I'm free because I know that in the end I'm going to make it all the way through so Satan has no Authority and no power this morning unless we give it to him the only one that controls it is going to be us what are you going to allow what are you going to let him have this morning amen we'll take it to the scriptures as we start to set a foundation before we get into our main thought this morning Jesus is talking and he says then said Jesus Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye me my disciples indeed you got to continue you can't just start but you got to keep going you got to keep moving with God he said and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free there's a way to be free and it's the truth that does it amen there's a process and we'll see what that looks like in a moment and they answered him the priest answered him and said we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free Now Catch because Jesus is offering them freedom and they say we're not bound God can't help you if you don't realize where you're at if you don't think you need help then he can't help you if you don't think you're bound then he can't free you if you don't think you're a slave then he can't take you out of prison you got to recognize where you are this morning amen that's why we call this the house of correction it's to let us see our place by the word and by that same word set us free that's what's going on in the services amen it brings us where we ought to be by the word of God and it says and then Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is a servant of sin what's he saying sin unbelief is the master of everyone until you're set free and it's only Christ can set you free it's only the word of truth that can set you free and whether we realize it or not we're born as slaves and it takes a a real experience with Christ to free us he says the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed not just a little bit that word indeed means truly in reality certainly it's the real deal he says you'll really be free you think you're free now you'll really be free if you've been set free by the Sun so we know there's an absolute freedom in Christ and it comes by the word of God it comes by the truth of God but it's not by the written word only but it's by the Living Word it's by the power of the Holy spirit in our lives and Jesus would say this a little later in John he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come see he said the spir the truth will set you free then he says when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth and he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come Jesus said the spirit the truth shall make you free then he says the spirit of Truth is coming to guide you into all truth and when we put those together we realize that freedom comes not just in word knowledge but in what it's when the word is quickened by the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit has to Quicken the word it has to make it alive to set you free because otherwise brother brandham says you say you can you you know I know this and I know that and the Bible he says that just proves you can read that doesn't prove you've got it it doesn't prove you believe it it just proves that you can read but we can study this word and we can read it till we're blue in the face but until God quickens it to us it does us no good it's just head knowledge that's where Saul was until he got converted he had the word completely set up in his life and he was Antichrist at the same time because he needed the Holy Spirit brother Brian would say this he says the word is dead until it's quickened by the spirit we can sit in church and we can hear the preaching of the word and it's good and it'll make us good citizens if we obey it and I'm not against that obviously but until you're filled with the Holy Spirit it doesn't take effect the way it ought to that's just a simple truth that's just the way it is you have to be born again and we know that by experience today Jesus saw it in his day with the priesthood they had tremendous knowledge and understanding and they lived lives that generally speaking to the to the external Observer were perfect that you couldn't put a finger on their life and say they're breaking the law and yet the Living Word comes along and he shows them where their error is and they couldn't see it and they hated him for it and we see it today even as something as simple as water baptism you know to me there's nothing clearer in the scriptures than water baptism in Jesus name and you look at the denominations and they do everything in jesus' name except water baptism you say how can that be how can that be and you show them the scriptures and you line it up and they keep coming back to the titles over and over and over again why they just can't see it because the spirit isn't there to Quicken it it's not their fault it's not their fault they're blinded to it remember what Jesus said to his disciples he said therefore speak I to them in Parables he's talking to about the other people he says because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive then he drops to verse 16 he says but blessed are your eyes for they see your eyes work he says and blessed are your ears for they hear I want you to understand what Jesus is saying to the disciples he's saying the people don't understand because it's not given to them to understand it's not meant for them it's only meant for the elect it's only meant for the Sons and Daughters of God he says you're blessed because your eyes see and your ears hear and you understand but let me say something at that moment when he says that they don't understand the thing that he's saying cuz they've said explain to us the parable they have no more understanding than those that are supposedly not blessed he's saying you're blessed but they don't understand the thing but then what happens the spirit of Truth explains to them what's going on and all of a sudden they understand they say that makes total sense What it Took the spirit of Truth in the fullness of godhead bodily in Christ to explain to them what was going on that's the only way we can understand what's going on church is when when he's here when he's in the house when the Holy Spirit is present to Quicken to us his word and what's going on Amen I was talking to with some of the Believers this week not just uh here in newf land but elsewhere and I said I think we've forgotten how good we have it sometimes and I think maybe speaking more to those that have been born into this message we take for granted I think what we know and what we understand because we've always had it and it's always made sense to to us and it's always been in our life but those that have come out from denominations or just come out from the world they understand more what it looks like out there they understand what it's like to be blind to be lost in a way that we don't and now I can pick up my phone and I've got 1,200 sermons audio and text perfectly transcribed and I can find anything and do anything with this message that I want and we forget it's the pearl of great price it's a precious Jew jeel worth more than anything else but why do we have it because he has opened our eyes because the spirit of Truth has come to us and we've heard the voice and we've recognized the voice and that's only because he put an antenna in us that could understand it in the first place that could pick up on that thing amen but the easiest thing for us to do and I know I've said this a lot lately and I'm going to keep saying it because I believe it with all my heart the easiest thing for a message believer to do is rest on the intellectual knowledge of this message M and that is death if that's where we stay I'll preach it till I'm dead if all you have is understanding you're lost because you don't understand it the way you do until you get the new birth remember what Paul said he says not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who ha also made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen if we sit here and rest on on God said to prophet and I believe in an end time message and there's a bride that's getting ready and we aren't living in the reality of those things we're going to be very sorely disappointed on Resurrection morning we're going to be sitting there saying but I thought I had it that is not where it ends that's where it starts but it's not where it ends it's got to be a reality in each every one of our Lives I was talking to a minister this we week and and he said we're he travels a lot more obviously than I do and he said we're seeing a global issue of churches dying out he says and it's because they're staying in the past they haven't continued on with God they haven't continued on in the understanding of the message and what happens is they don't transition as the word of God Transitions and the churches die out because they're relics to men and Ministries and the Holy Spirit is not there anymore it's died out because they haven't kept moving on with God and it's killing their churches and and I've seen it myself I know it to be true that we've got to keep moving on as God moves on Amen it's the holy spirit that leads the church it's not we had a pastor for 43 years when he moved aside then the Holy Spirit didn't stop preaching amen and we've had these wonderful men and there many of them have died off there's only a few of those original Witnesses left that's not the leadership of the church the leadership of the church is the Holy Ghost and it moves from vessel to vessel from man to man from Ministry to Ministry People to People child to child It Never Dies it's a living thing amen but we're going to pick up now that's just my Preamble for this morning but we're going to pick up where we left off last service and if you remember we talked about no weapon that is formed against you can prosper and we talked that footsteps is possession and then we talked about how God said fear not time and time again and he said be of good courage don't worry and why did he say that because we are powerful no we just read Paul said our sufficiency is of God we're ins sufficient in ourselves our rest is not in that I am some great thing or I'm some great believer I've got this that or the other our sufficiency is in God remember what God said he said I'm going to go ahead of you and I'm going to fight for you and I'm going to put the fear of God in them and I'm going to put the fear of them in the of you and them he says and then you're going to go and you're going to take over greater and more powerful Nations than yourselves cuz I'm going to fight the victory for you amen we read this quote and it's where where I really want to kick things off this morning where brother Bram said this he said the strength of the Holy Ghost lays in God's promise in other words if we're looking for God to fight on our behalf we've got to find our place in the word of God we've got to find our fight in the word of God we've got to find our circumstances our situation whatever it is our promise we've got to find it in the word of God and we've got to make sure we're on the right side because there's two sides of the word of God there's for and there's against and if you're for then God's for you and if you're against then God's against you God's never for you or against you he's for his word so you you got to be in his word you've got to be on the right side of his word to for him to come on your side amen so we've got to stay within the boundaries remember you've got to know that you're in a word position and how do you do that you find your place in the word in Christ in the local body you got to find where you're supposed to be and what you're supposed to be doing and then when you find that you say Lord this is my land this is my possession this is my property I'm claiming it I'm standing on it now you help me to hold it and keep it and then God can go to work for you amen like I said before if you're on Satan's territory you're going to lose every single time because you have no right outside of the word of God that's his land he has kingdoms he has positions he has authorities he has principalities and they belong to him but if it's your land that God has given you then you've got a right now if you want to go there amen you don't have a title deed to Satan's property you got a title deed to God's word that's where we rest amen now just remember just cuz Satan's on it doesn't mean it's his property amen CU remember what brother BR said he said Satan is a squatter he has no right he has no title he has no possession but he'll go there and he'll set up a fortress he'll build up an Army on something that belongs to you and what he's hoping is that as you come up and you see the castle there that you say that doesn't belong to me and you move on cuz Satan's the ultimate Bluff Satan's the ultimate strategist his his intention is to make it look harder than it really is to make it look like it's going to be too much of a battle that you can't win it amen but remember God said you're going to face greater enemies and stronger enemies than yourself and you'll defeat them you'll take their lands from them because their lands belong to you now Satan will remind you of the part that he's greater than you and bigger and mightier because Satan loves to quote partial verses Satan never likes to give you context or the whole thing amen but there where we want to see ourselves is in the whole verse because remember what Jesus what what what Moses said he said then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater Nations and mightier greater and mightier than yourselves so our power is not in ourselves it's in God that wins the battle amen we're fighting but God is the power he's the great champion in our midst and we're relying on him all the way amen we'll win because what greater is he that's in you than he that's a greater of than he that's in the world it's Christ in me that's winning the battle it's not me that's winning the battle I fail every day when I trust in myself I fail every day but when I let him take control then that's where the battle's won amen so as I mentioned last service I want to talk about the Holy Spirit this morning as an enforcer in our lives because if we can realize that we don't have to win we'll relax a bit remember the scripture says the battle belongs to God the battle is the Lord's so it's not that I have to win it's that I have to resist resistance is our requirement overcoming and victory is God's requirement cuz he's the one that's overcome he's the one that's got the the the keys to death Hell In The Grave dangling on his belt tonight today he's the one that's already won the battle amen scripture says resist the devil and he will flee from you but again sometimes we focus on the resistance but I want to take us back to read that full scripture because before comes resistance something else has to happen amen we don't just resist but if we go to the actual scripture it says submit yourselves therefore to God then resist the devil and he will flee from you submission we've got to put ourselves in God's hand we've got to find ourselves in his word this morning because when we get in our way that's when we get tempted when we get on our path when we get in our will when we get in our opinion that's when Satan has access to us amen because what we walk out of it amen but if we're submitted to God then Temptation comes to us we don't go to it it's external to us and so we can resist because we haven't invited it but remember the scripture says that when we're says let no man say he's tempted of God he says but we're tempted because we're drawn aside by our own lusts so what happens is when we're not submitted to God what are we submitted to self and self takes us off the road and it gets us into a place where now we've walked towards something that we're supposed to resist now if this is my Temptation and I'm in Christ and I'm over here this if it happens to walk over here I've got every right to say get out of my life but if this is my Temptation and I go over here and I say get out of my life and I'm the one that's walked up to it how do you push away something you walked up to it didn't come to you you came to it the problem's not with the Temptation the problems with you so you can't resist unless you're submitted to God Amen if you've walked towards Temptation your Temptation your temptation of yourself it's your fault that's the reason's there amen so first we submit second we resist third Satan has to flee that's the way it works submission is the first requirement amen cuz when we realize that the battle belongs to God we realize our role we understand it our our position is to resist his is to provide the power amen ours is to surrender his is to provide Victory we're letting go and he's doing the work amen our Authority is to ask by the word and it's his power that enforces it by the word we ask and he enforces brother Braham says this he says we don't have power we got Authority it's not a power it's Authority we don't need power Christ has the power but we've got the authority amen there's a a lot of difference he was the one who conquered he conquered and gave us the authority he's got the power but we got the authority just like any Ambassador going to another country we've got this misconception sometimes that we use the Holy Spirit as a power church we don't use God that that's like your dog using you if I could put it that crudely our pets don't tell us what to do our children don't tell us what to do and when they do they find out something in a hurry don't they you don't tell Mommy and Daddy what to do we don't tell God what to do we don't use the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit uses us that's the simple truth amen it's not how God works he's not some sugar daddy and that's what so much of Christianity has turned him into is you ask and you get you ask and you get you ask and you get no you got to find your way you got to be submitted you got to be surrendered and then you'll start to ask the right things and then you'll start to receive the right things you got to seek the kingdom of God first and then you'll start getting the rest God's looking for people that are seeking him not everything that he provides and then seek The Giver of the gift before you seek the gifts I would say it that way Peter and John didn't use the Holy Spirit they were used by the Holy Spirit Paul didn't use the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit used Paul we've talked about when when when Paul was and and Silas were being followed by that that girl that that fortunetelling girl and for days she followed them and she said these are the men that show us the way of Salvation and day after day it says and then Paul being grieved what was he grieved by the Holy Spirit was finally grieved and then he turned around he cast that demon out of her why he was used by the Holy Spirit if Paul had power of his own he'd cast it out right away because we'd say well I don't want to deal with that but the Holy Spirit used Paul to deliver that girl when it was time because guess what she was a witness for them for a couple days and then he delivered her of that spirit that was on her amen we'll we'll see as we're going through this that these these Apostles and ministers and these things they're not using the Holy Spirit the holy spirit's using them brother brah says my gift is to let myself go it's to surrender that's what this is about it's about surrender not a power because when you're yielded God can use you brother Hank and I were talking we had a wonderful time of fellowship with him and sister Verna four and a half hours on Thursday and it was just a a wonderful time and he was reminded me he said that he says you're just a microphone until God speaks that's the way it's supposed to be you don't speak unless he speaks because you're a mute instrument unless he's using you I was sharing with him some of the testimony of some of the past of my life and and these different things amen but to an outside person it looks like you're using power but it's not it's power that's using you and that's the way that this looks amen but remember we have authority so brother Braham says here you don't have power but you've got Authority and the authority comes by the word of God and as we move closer into preaching on adoption we'll see that God gives you authority to match your character he gives you authority to match your character it's like uh in a business you have people that can write checks throughout the you know you've got your uh your your people on the um accounts receivable and accounts payable and they've got they can write so much for checks on their own and then after a certain while they've got to have somebody more Superior to them sign off on it and you get a big enough amount and the CEO has to sign off on it and each of us has checks that we can cash to certain things but there are certain things that every one of us is allowed to cash no matter what amen healing is in every bank account Deliverance is in every bank account provision is in every bank account leadership and direction is in every bank account we've all got a certain level but beyond that God sets up levels of authority and it's based on what our character and when you find your place in the word and in the body of Christ then you'll find the authority that's God's granted to you now when brother Bradon would speak on this thought on the enforcer as the holy the Holy Spirit as an enforcer he only does it in one message out of all 1,200 odd that he does there's only one message and it's in the message the restoration of the brid tree it's the only place he talks about the Holy Spirit as an enforcer so we'll see it perhaps a little different as we thought now we say what's an enforcer now the original enforcer was in the mafia or the gangs where they had these men with with big muscles and big bodies and not often a lot of intelligence and and I looked one up and and this is a modern day enforcer you know in in New York or Chicago they had these guys and they go and they make sure that that people did what they were told to do and if you didn't do what they told you to do then they tuned you up with a beating or they beat up your business or they drove your customers away they beat up your property they gave your family a hard time whatever it was so they were there to enforce the wrong side of the law they were goons they were Thugs and then of course those of you that play hockey you know that there was a role of an enforcer there and guys like Bob Probert here and what happened is if you touched the star player then they come over and they beat you up now they take a penalty for it but the goal was to make make it so that their best players their star players could have more freedom on the ice that you weren't hacking and chopping and body checking them and doing these things even though some of those things are legal but they wanted to keep their star players free so that they could score goals and win games and so if you if you touch them then they said you touch him you got to deal with me and they'd fight you whether you wanted to or not they were an enforcer now that's gone mostly out of the game today because the game's so quick you can't have a guy that's just a goon out there because they'll score goals all day on him so that's moved out of the way but when brother bradam starts to talk about it these are two illegals if I could put it that way they're on the wrong side of the law they're not on the side of right they're on the on the side of wrong but when brother brandham talks about it he puts him on the right side of the law side of the law and he puts him in alignment with the word of God and he says he's a Lawman he's like a sheriff he's like a police officer he says that's what the holy spirit is is he's an officer of the law to enforce the word of God in your life and in your situation now here's what he would say so we're going to go into just a few quotes on this for a bit he says to restore means to return to the former owner or to bring back to the former state of condition he says and we can enforce a claim to be restored he says and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place so in other words there's a purpose behind this enforcer of the Holy Spirit and it's to bring you back to Restoration it's to restore you the the Holy Spirit say not just running around willy-nilly doing whatever we ask but he's there to enforce a restoration of the Bride to her original condition amen so if you're in the Plan of Redemption if you're in the plan of restoration then you've got an enforcer on your side you've got the Holy Ghost on your side amen and he's going to bring you all the way and he's going to knock down everything that stands in front of you brother bam says he continues he says to restore means to bring back or to restore a claim can uh a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time bring it back to its natural condition he said that in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore he says look if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces it enforces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner to its liable First Estate so now brother BR starting to narrow the focus of the Holy Spirit as an enforcer here because it's to bring us back to our Natural State now let me say this if you're a child of heav hell you're in your natural state nothing's going to change but if you're a child of God we're not in our natural state right now there's nothing natural there's nothing original about the state that we're in this morning amen so the holy spirit is here because he's not out there just to do whatever we ask or want but he's there to enforce a restoration of the brid tree he's there to enforce the restoration of the authority of the word in our lives and in the property of God that's what he's there for what is our natural position in fellowship with Christ that's our natural position so the focus of the holy spirit is to restore us to relationship with Christ as it was in the beginning as Adam and Eve had it at it in the Garden of Eden brother Braham says brother if God gave an Eagle wings to take him from danger to safety and as long as he could feel those wings operating right what difference did it make what kind of a danger he was in remember he's talking about that that eagle and he he went and he he shot he pointed the rifle at the eagle and he said you know I could just shoot you he said that eagle just looked at me and then just went and he was gone he said and I couldn't couldn't have got him first nor last he said he wasn't worried because why he had wings that worked now he says but what ought a man to do with the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he feels the spirit of God operating right catch this now operating right blessing him and giv giving him the deep deep things that he desires and the love that he desires of God brother what are you praying for for the Holy Ghost to do in your life to Fellowship to walk with him amen what can the devil put before you God's or Paul said oh death where's your sting grave where's your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ even death in the grave could not nothing could like scare that old Apostle he knew that he had fellowship with Christ but he said what is he looking for he says when the spirit of God is operating in you to do what to bring you to Fellowship to walk with God we read the scripture a few verses ago seek ye first the kingdom of God what seek restoration to your position in Christ and everything else you have need of will be added but see the thing is we want the Holy Spirit to add all of these things and we're not so worried about our relationship being restored with Christ Focus On Christ first focus on getting back in relation with him focus on getting close to him and you'll start to see those other things start to fall into line amen we're not here seeking power and authority for the Natural Things of life and for uh positions or manifestations in ourselves for our natural blessings that's not what the Holy Spirit was meant for amen but we're walking the highway to Heaven and the holy spirit's here to take us all the way through Amen to give us our freedom as we walk that path that we can go all the way back to Christ amen he's in our lives to to bring us back to our original condition not to make this one more palatable but to take us out of it we're pilgrims and strangers here today this is not our home this is not our rest this is not our peace this is not our final place our final condition we're getting out of here and the holy spirit's here to take us to where we're going amen what do we have in our original condition we have relationship with Christ we had eternal life and we had total Dominion the first thing he's restoring back is relationship that gives us a turn life and that'll bring us to Total Dominion the total Dominion comes later church we don't have total Dominion here we don't cuz God's got to burn it all God's got to destroy it all but what you'll find is the total Dominion happens here in this body we've got and once he's got that Soul sealed like we talk about now he starts to take dominion over the Mind Over the spirit and over the body and that's why the body is the last thing to be changed because that's the last place of total dominion and that's when our bodies changed into a glorious body like his and we go into a resurrection we go in a Rapture amen that's what he's doing so the focus of the holy spirit is not to change around us it's to change us first and then when you're changed now he can start to use you for the the good of the kingdom of God and the good of others brother BR says enforce he says then we have the privilege to enforce listen a privilege is granted not everyone has privilege in certain things not everyone has what you have he says we're given the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it he says because we can take God's agent the holy spirit and go right on down on our knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all cuz the holy spirit is there to make him do it he says the law of the land is to enforce without enforcement the law means nothing he says but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully and deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church has given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon him now I want to stop here for a second because notice what he said he said what Satan has unrightfully and deceitfully taken if you give it to Satan if you open the door to Satan if you agree that Satan can have anything then he's got a right to be there when you let let him do it then he has a right to be there if you love that Spirit if you love that habit if you love that condition if you love that relationship if you love that hidden thing in your life then he can stay there as long as you love it it'll be there as long as you want it to be there amen if you got knowledge of the truth and you turn it aside because you love that thing more Satan has a right to be in your life and until you find the love of God greater than the love of that it'll stay there but if one day you get the love of God in your life in a greater way it'll kick that thing right out of your life CU it can't stay in the presence of the Holy Ghost in your life amen you'll make a choice one day that's what it'll be and you'll say I don't like this anymore and it'll go Paul said in Romans he said neither yield ye your members your natural faculties and body don't give any of this as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead your you're dead and Christ lives in you now he says as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God brother BR says listen destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you he'll do it bring back the oldfashioned meetings and the thing and leave Delilah alone leave the world alone that thing that Woos you off into little things that you shouldn't and little things troubles come up in the church and you won't stand correction because you don't have to you can drop off to another church and things like that he said in the early days when a man didn't cope up with the word of God they packed him out dead bring us back to Pentecost he said not Hollywood Showmanship but a wholehearted turn to God is what we need once more oh Lord once more Church you know your own lives I know my own life and I may not have a Delila like Samson did but we've all got things that can seduce us Delilah didn't come along for 20 years in Samson's life you know the the scripture is funny that way it it'll skip over long periods of time as if nothing happened cuz you remember Samson had issues with women how did he get issues with women by walking around the Philistine Landes he got out of where he was supposed to be and he got into the world and all of a sudden he started seeing pretty women and he had a real problem with pretty women and it led him to problems over and over again but then he got away from pretty women in the land of philistia and for 20 years he judged Israel perfectly and then the scripture comes and it says and and Samson found a woman named Delilah in the valley of sork and all of a sudden Samson realizes he didn't conquer that it was still an issue do you know where the valley of Sorak is it's right on the border of Israel and fisa how did Sam how did Samson get into trouble he got over on the border he got over on the edge he started looking in a land that he hadn't conquered he started looking at a world that he wasn't supposed to be a part of and pretty soon he was right there in the middle of it and the thing that he had conquered conquered him because he got out of his place he got out of his position what's a judge doing looking in the land of fisa he had no place he had no right he had no purpose of being there he got LED astray by his own curiosity and by his own lusts amen but I like how brother Bram said that thing that Woos you into little things that you shouldn't scripture says it's the little foxes that spoil the vine and sometimes it's the little things that cause us the biggest grief because they seem little but they have a big effect cuz they nip the life out of us and they cause the fruit to to wither and they cause the leaves to wither it's the little things that can cause those problems amen feel like we've lost the victory it's not big things often in the lives of Believers it's the little things that keep dragging us down sometimes the problem is we keep injecting ourselves into situations it's a lesson I've had to learn the hard way God does all things perfectly and then I get involved and they go not so perfectly sometimes it's the little me that keeps trying to get into things that God's already handling on his own what's brother BR saying get away from it cut its head off leave it and once you've left it don't go back to it don't go looking over there that's your past that's your past and you have no point in being around that leave it alone leave her alone whatever it is you know sometimes we pretend I've got it under control if it's in your life it's got control if it's in your life it has control because if it's an Unholy thing the Holy Spirit won't let it stay there it's got control don't let him fool you I've got it under control no if it's still there and it's an Unholy thing Satan has control get away from the edge don't play with the fire but if you're a sincere believer and Satan's trying to put something in your life you don't have to deal with it you have a right to enforce a claim amen anything that would keep you from being restored back to your natural position in Christ you've got a law that you can send out for enforcement brother brah says and if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring them back he says if he's Afflicted you and made you sick we have a right before God to enforce the laws of God by his stripes we are healed amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out yonder of death and we claim him bring him back now he says that's the enforcement restore it back back to its natural condition again if there was never a before there can't be an again if you didn't already have it you can't have it now but he says because you had it you can have it because you were perfect you can be perfect because you were healthy you can be healthy because you did have a sound mind you can have a sound mind because you did have peace you have peace because you did have joy you can have joy you can have it because it was always yours it always belongs to you amen as a child of God it's because you were then that you can have it now today he says and a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is sick see they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim they say it's not our claim it's our claim because God give it to us he says by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the lawgiver the Holy Spirit himself is here the agent of God to see that it's done that way amen now the only way he can work catch this this is my Bolding it here the only way he can work is when you let him work he says see you've got to believe it there's a law so we do have a part to play we do have something we have to do and he says we can't just desire it we can't just like it we can't just speak it he says we've got to believe it that's our part to play is we've got to believe that healing isn't just for that brother or that sister or salvation or the holy ghost or Deliverance whatever it might be you got to believe that it's for you you've got to put your name in that scripture amen we've got to believe it and our belief is expressed in our actions James said faith without works is dead amen how we Act is going to show what we believe not just what we say brother Bram says you need the holy ghost to press out there in other words don't try this on your own he says Satan knows that reasoning and what reasoning where reasoning lays yes sir to be an effectual witness of his resurrection he knew it would take the Holy Ghost cuz man cannot do those things he equipped his army with the Holy Ghost to do those things to make known the secrets of the heart as he promised you can't do that with any kind of training you've got to do that by the baptism of the Holy Spirit the armor of God and this is the evening light to make Hebrews 138 reality he says it would take more than a training you can't be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever by training he says you got to get the Holy Ghost he says you can read words and read words and read words and it'll never make it come to pass until you have the Holy Ghost there to manifest that that's the light he says putting on the whole armor of God not just a dress only dress up and say glory to God I got the Holy Ghost he says then you're spurting all the power out the whistle you're doing no good put it in action put it in faith make it move make it do something putting on the whole armor of God to go out and withstand the Ws of the devil he says let the mind of Christ that was in let the mind that was in Christ be in you he said takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost the whole armor of God not just to shake hands with a preacher put your name on the book or take some kosher and swallow it and a priest drink up the wine that isn't it but Brothers stay there until there comes a rushing Mighty Wind that fills all your being takes all your doubts out takes all your Creeds out takes everything else out and puts the word in there with the power of God behind it to back it up he says brother the whole armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the word behind it the whole purpose of this message is to restore the True Church of God back to the leadership of the Holy Spirit just as it was in the book of Acts except this time it'll take us into resurrection and Rapture it'll take us us all the way it was supposed to go that's the purpose but before we can have that we've got to have the first fruits we've got to have a taste before we can get the full thing brother Brown would say that healing is a down payment of the resurrection of the body change the Holy Ghost is the down payment of your full salvation you get a taste of the victory before you get the full Victory you get a first fruit before you get the whole Harvest and so he say says you got a right to claim these things he says while it's taking you in the path to get you to the full meal deal and then we get a portion before we get the whole thing brother Bram says now we have a law the law of the life in US you are made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knuckle down to the devil we've got a law and that's the law the Holy Spirit now he said last time he says the only thing you have to do is believe he says the only thing you you have to do is know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work when you let go and let God that's all see remember submit yourselves to God resist the devil and he will flee from you it's the surrender that's the key part let him go to working we say oh when I come into full maturity I'm going to do so and so when I'm adopted I'm going to have spoken word authority and I'm going to do this and I'm no no you won't that's about you you got to defeat you and if everything you're talking about is in the future you'll be so caught up you can't defeat the present if everything is in the future then what's going on now you won't have a future if there's nothing happening in the present because the spirit is Alive and Well to work in us today amen with an attitude of II we won't defeat our own self much less Satan the first victory's got to be inside of us amen but when you come into full maturity you'll be so completely convinced that you can't do a thing that God will have full preeminence in your life and you'll know because you'd have tried you'd have tried to do it in yourself you to try to do it your way and you've seen what comes out of it and so you say Lord I'm going to trust you all the way on this I'm not going to even stick my finger in the water to help us along on this boat of life I'm just going to keep all of myself inside here and we're going to get let you take care of this journey and you'll speak when he tells you to speak you'll be quiet when he tells you to be quiet you you'll act when he tells you to act you'll pray how he tells you to pray you'll move how he tells you to move on a daily basis because it'll be Christ in you that's operating amen and we'll be dead to ourselves I have to die so that he can have the preeminence and that's a daily thing Paul said I've noticed the closer we get to God the less we talk about ourselves I've met some tremendous tremendous Believers in my life and I'll tell you the greatest Believers you can't barely pull a thing out about themselves but I'll tell you they'll brag on God and they'll testify of the good things of God but they won't talk about themselves cuz they've learned that it's Christ in them that is the great Overcomer Amen brother said if the fish said wait I'll catch my breath real good I'll breathe up a little oxygen in me and I'll see if I can go down he's talking about letting go he says no if he does that he'll burst open see the bird says I'll see how fast I can run down here and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down see he's got to know how that law can control him and the same way it is with it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it it is to know that the law of life is in you he says and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours and by letting go and letting God that's why I said we can relax when we realize the battle is not ours the greatest battle is to let go to trust to believe and to act in faith and then the battle is the holy spirits but notice he says the law of the life is where in you you've got to know you've got the Holy Ghost you got to know you've got the Holy Ghost I'm going to say it again you've got to know you've got the Holy Ghost because if you don't you can have no confidence no confidence cuz if you don't believe you got the Holy Ghost then where's the enforcer who are you cuz a child of God will have the Holy Ghost eventually you got to know youve got it he says that's the reason the law of life that was in Christ when the word was spoken and said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in Hell there wasn't enough time there wasn't enough Devils there wasn't enough anything to keep Christ in that grave till his body begin to rot because the law of God will bring the word to pass he says and the law of God by the Holy Spirit brings any promise to pass regardless of the conditions now I want you to catch we're going to start to close here brother bam focuses on this he says job said though the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh I'll see God church this is the meat of this service regardless of how little we are how low we are how impure we are how Unholy we are how sick we are how Afflicted we are does that include us all this morning low little impure Unholy sick or Afflicted what he's saying is it don't matter where you're at he says the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him forces the issue and says give it back he says amen oh if we could just think of that for a minute forces it regardless of conditions no matter what the condition is the law of God's word forces a condition to cope with his word see it's got to church that gives me hope this morning that gives me courage this morning that gives me Faith this morning that gives me a hunger and an expectation this morning that my condition will not hold back the word of God my failures my flaws my my my faults whatever it might be my my own idea of myself my own disappointment in myself won't hold back the word of God it has nothing to do with it not a thing to do with it anyone feeling low this morning anyone feeling sick this morning anyone feeling impure or Unholy this morning anybody think you're nothing this morning don't put up your hands you probably wouldn't because you're feeling too little this is for you it's for all of us amen we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God but he says nothing no condition he says well hold it back the word of God forces the condition to cope with his word the first place it does is in me and in you forget the external the internal is the first victory this body of Flesh this mind this spirit this Soul that's the first place of Victory then he starts to move outside of those things before he can use you he's got to bring you and your being subject to him and then he can start to use you for the outside benefit amen once he's got your soul sealed then he's moving in on your mind and your spirit and your body to restore them back to their natural condition and as you grow in Christ now he can start to use you amen I'm glad I can't hold him back this morning I'm glad that he's pushing him forward regardless that he's not looking at this condition that's why we have the blood so that he doesn't see the condition in a sinful way just in a needful way and he's just restoring us back to what he saw amen and any obstacle he's bringing it subject to the law of his word to move it out of the way he says then the law of God has to work by that word he says we're coming down to a great thing in a minute where the law of God's word the law of God is with his word now the court writes out a word it's a certain certain thing and a penalty to do so and so all right now that's the word of the court and the law of the Court enforces the word of the court and God speaks something and that is a law and the Holy Spirit is here to enforce that law amen for the believer now watch this he says you have to be ordained to do it and it takes a Believer remember those things that are to those that believe he says you got to have the badge of believer somebody says you got power no but we got Authority that's it not power but Authority we ain't got enough power to do nothing church let me ask you are we Believers this morning are we Believers this morning if you're a Believer we're talking to you we're talking to you this morning have you've been born again I'm reading out of your title deed this morning I'm reading out of the word of God that says this is what the inheritance of the righteous is of the sinless Spotless bride of Christ this is for you I'm telling you what God has put under your name in your bank account amen I don't know what we're dealing with this morning I know some things we're dealing with but I don't know all of it you know what you're dealing with you know where he's Satan's pressing in maybe he's got a stronghold this morning but you look at that and you can if you can find your place in the word if you can find your promise in the word then Satan has to move Satan has to move amen maybe you're scared cuz you've tried and failed anybody else tried and failed before it's always harder the second time isn't it or the third time or the 10th time just say Lord I'm coming once again just once more Lord give me an opportunity to believe your word once more that's all Samson said at the end Lord just once more he died just once more and we'll live men and freedom will reign in our hearts and lives man if the musicians would come this morning I'm just going to read two scriptures in a quote cuz I want to tell you a bit about your enemy this morning you know let me show you how this ends for him and it's a prophecy that's written but it's written in the present and Isaiah said this he says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did we weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high i i i i i that's what I said but here's what the word says yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit now here's your part Church they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider the say as this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms church when you see who's been bothering you all this time you're going to say that little pipsqueak is the one I was scared of that little wimp that shrimp that's who I was fighting because remember he's a bluff he's a bluff and I hope we don't say if I knew he was this small I would have pressed harder I would have taken more I would have believed more I would have done more look church he wrote this in the present even though it was in the future so we know this is what's going to happen you're going to have a day where you're going to come over here and you're going to look down at Satan and going to say really really church are we being fooled this morning by a pipsqueak we've got a word of God that tells us he's a pipsqueak that he's a bluff that he's nothing he's nothing don't wait for then to say I wish I'd had done more I wish I to believe more I wish I'd to take him more we're going to take more we're going to take everything that he's got got to have for us amen but you got to understand your enemy is already defeated he has no house he has no rights he has no title deed he has no claim to you and he's just a little wimp trying to Bluff you out of your possession look what it says of us says and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now has come salvation strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ you you need salvation you've got it if you need strength got it the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost he says in the power of His Christ it's all available he says for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down out of Heaven which accuse him before our God day and night so God defeats Satan in heaven and then he sends them down to earth and guess what happens on Earth and they who's they they they overcame him he got defeated up there and God sent him down and says now my bride's going to beat you up they overcame him how by the blood of the Lamb Church Without Calvary we've lost already he says but and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives under the death you can't win without Calvary but your words matter your testimony matters and the word of Our Testimony is right here that's when we s what the word says and we do what the word does and that's what gives us the victory amen God wrote this God takes John up into a higher place and he writes it in the past tense God has written your Victory is already done the French would say F comp it's done it's a finished work your victory has already been written into the scripture and the word cannot fail your Victory your overcoming testimony is already there that you overcame by the blood of the lamb and how you confess the word of God in your life and how you acted on it amen let's stand this morning God wrote this the spirit of the truth comes to John and he lifts him up into this place and he writes that scripture to show you things that are to be remember what the Jesus said of this this the the spirit of Truth he says when he comes what he'll lead and guide you into all truth and he'll show you things to come I'm showing you things to come cuz the time for things to come is right now he wouldn't just show you what's going to happen but he'll show you the events in your own life he'll bring it to pass in your own life it's already recorded remember what I said brother Hank said that it's already on the film you've already overcome you've already been healed you've already been delivered you've already been changed you just have to walk through the film now brother brah says said this and when we take our stand today when men say these things can happen don't be fussing with them that's wrong don't fuss with them but pick up the sword he says you look at what's supposed to be in this day when God gave his promise for today pick this up and go and all the goliaths will fall under it you know where Satan hides Satan hides in the I'm dealing with it and I'm putting up with it it's not bad enough that we go to God about it and you know what that's the little things that suck the life out of us it's the little things that take our energy that take our victory that take our testimony because if Satan can't get you on the big things he'll get you in the little things you know it was striking you know brother ma came up for prayer for a stomach issue and God healed him you know what he came and said to me he said brother John now I'm praying for your stomach issue cuz I don't care about it cuz I deal with it I deal with it that's not the attitude of an overcomer we don't have to deal with it we've got an enforcer that'll deal with it we deal with it by dealing with it amen you don't have to have it this morning I don't have to have it this morning that's about our heads Heavenly Father Lord what a word you've given us and Lord all I'm asking for this morning Lord is Faith to believe it and act on it Lord not just for me but for everyone within the hearing of my voice this morning Lord we know the Battle Belongs to You Lord but we've got to lift up that word sword Lord we've got to believe we've got to act
