kind God has been good so good I have been [Music] blessed Lord we're a blessed people this morning Lord even before we came into your presence Lord before we knew who you were Lord we were blessed because because our names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life Lord before the very foundation of the world but Lord since we've stepped into your word since we've stepped into your plan Lord and Lord we can be a part of it Lord we can know what's going on we can Lord make decisions in the way that you'd have us to Lord we're even more blessed Lord to be a part of this great work that you're doing Lord we're thankful for this people that's gathered this morning Lord we're thankful for a desire in our heart to come and preach the word Lord to hear the word Lord to live the word to be the word Lord and we're coming in this morning Lord saying set us aside Lord and build yourself up Lord build us into this stature of a perfect man and woman in Christ Lord make us Lord what you would have us to be make us effective Lord in what you've called us to be Lord and let us lay aside every weight and sin that does easily beset us we pray Lord touch your people again we pray Lord many sick Lord many traveling today Lord we pray your grace your hand of mercy your hand of protection Lord your hand of healing upon each and every one we pray Lord now bless us here Lord not just here Lord but where your bride is gathered today Lord where anointed men are Lord may you just set them aside Lord use their lips use their bodies Lord to preach your word to your bride Lord that she could be made into the perfect image of Christ we pray Lord let us find our places this morning we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and greet each one amen certainly appreciate each one that's made it we've got many traveling and sick as I said so we want to remember them amen we want to remember brother Grant's mother especially amen that's a serious need that she has there and we're trusting that the Lord will just go and just Reach Out And Touch her body amen and Michael also very sick with brother brother Paul had and it's one thing to to be sick as an adult because you know there's an end coming but when you're a kid you just don't know and it's it's very much in the moment so we want to remember him and of course sister Kimberly there just by way of announcement brother Dale has also let us know that he won't be standing for trustee in the coming year and uh I'll say this brother Dale I think you landed at exactly the right time and you came here and you put your shoulder to the wheel and and you made a huge difference so we thank you for your service but he's not stepping back from helping he just doesn't feel to be the trustee he's still going to be providing the muscle and the support as he always has so we appreciate that so if you feel that you could hold that position or if you know somebody that you think should take that position just have a chat with the deacons or send an email or a text however you want to reach out to them and just let them know who you think could could do that or if you want to do it that's even better we love a volunteer in these positions but uh we're thankful for each one that served and and there's no obligation there's no obligation for these things it's you know many of us and you put in your time and then your time's done and it's not wrong to to think it's bad to do that and it goes for Ministry it goes for the positions in the church no matter what it is so we just thank the Lord for each one that's that's been serving and continues to serve and when your time is done then we'll say praise the Lord and we'll look for others to take your place as well so God bless you each one amen 1 Corinthians chapter 12 bit of a longer scripture this morning as we open up so hold your Bibles here 1 Corinthians 12 and 27 just another thing I have changed the slides back to a darker slide with with white text and uh I I didn't go with a black background I went with a gray so hopefully this is a good kind of inet for those that have you know struggle to see from the back and then those that find it bright so if you if you like it let me know if you don't like it let me know and and uh we probably won't do a thing because we've gone back and forth now and this is the best I can probably do amen 1 Corinthians 12 and 27 says this now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular we're speaking we've been speaking on the stature of a perfect man and Paul says ye are the body of Christ he says and God hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets phets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues then he says are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles we look around is everybody everything does everybody have every gift we can't have every person to minister we can't have everybody doing the same thing and we can't have everybody that has everything otherwise why do we need a body but he says look around not everybody has has something like that and certainly not all of them have all of them he says have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret he says but covet earnestly the best gifts there's nothing wrong with Desiring in fact he says you should desire the best gifts not for yourself but for others but then he says and yet show I unto you a more excellent way there's only one other place in scripture we see that and that's with Cain and Abel and I liked how I think it was Brother David Nash brought this out that Cain's sacrifice was excellent but it was out of order in other words he didn't do the sacrifice first he brought the first fruits and you had to bring the sacrifice you needed your sins covered before you could bring the first fruits and what Paul's saying here is he's saying you've got to be careful that you don't bring the first fruits ahead of the sacrifice so then we'll continue on in 1 Corinthians 13 chapter 1 this is the more excellent way that Paul is talking about he says though I speak with the tongue of men and in and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could move remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth the mean nothing down to verse 8 but he says charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away he said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing on our series on manifesting time and I want to take a title this morning of coming into Perfection and and again we're speaking on the attributes of Charity and as I've said before there's lots of pieces lots of chunks with this and so we're going to cover another aspect of that this morning but as I said last service there's many angles to this when Peter said add charity to your life and we're going to talk about this thought of perfection for the next couple of services Lord willing and I know that there were a few that weren't there so just to do a brief you know recoup of what we covered last services that word charity that that he uses there is the Greek word agape and it means divine love and it is only used in the New Testament it's never used in the Old Testament and we show that that was because charity is is is personified in the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was not given before the New Testament before the New Covenant and so you couldn't see the expression you couldn't get the experience of True Divine love in the Holy Ghost until the New Testament so the word wasn't used in the Old Testament cuz the love they were under was different it all God's love and God has always been love and we talked about that but but this this this experience of divine love the ability to have that in your life did not happen until the day of Pentecost until Christ paid the price on Calvary and made a way back then we could not experience this Divine love and we could not project this Divine love more importantly until we had a new birth experience and so th this isn't just an attribute this charity is not just an attribute but it's the life of Jesus Christ Living inside of the believer it's the holy spirit inside of you producing the life of God and it flows out of you it doesn't just come into you so you have to receive charity in order to give charity you have to receive the Holy Ghost in order to give the Holy Ghost if I can put it that way and then we read where where John said un or Jesus said unless you're born of God and know God you can't have this Divine love so you have to have a you have to have a new birth and the only way you can have a new birth is to receive the Holy Ghost and then he says and then you have to know God in order to have this Divine love and that's a personal intimate experience and we talked about how that was a relationship between a man and a woman and it's this invisible Union that brother brandham talks about between the the the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom so this is all what's going inside of this is that you've got to have God to give God you've got to have love to give love and it's all one and the same thing the very attribute the very nature of God is love and so unless you have God you can't love the way that you're supposed to and we said it last service I believe that you can't truly love unless you have the Holy Ghost you can't do it and we know that you can't because we see what love has done to this world Amen welcome our brother Kingsley back all the way from Nigeria God bless you amen now we know that this this this holy spirit is reserved only for the children of God it's only reserved for the children of God Amen origin is Destin Destiny brother Brian would say and if you weren't a part of God in the beginning you can't be a part of God at the end so so so that doesn't mean though that you can't get eternal life if you're not a part of God cuz there's going to be a great white Throne judgment that comes and we'll be judged by works whoever doesn't make it in in in the resurrection and the Rapture they come before this throne and there's going to be people that are given eternal life they're granted eternal life the scripture says they don't have it but they're given it and it's because they did something for the bride for the children of God and most of them did it unknowingly they didn't realize that they' done something for somebody that mattered in the eyes of God and God has no unpaid debts God doesn't pay for like for like God gives you more than what you deserve cuz that's the kind of God that he is that means there's a place for every single person potentially but we know they won't take it we know they won't take it but yet there is a place but for you and I we're not granted eternal life the scripture says we are ordained unto eternal life we are promised eternal life because before the foundation of the world was God thought of us we were a part of his mind we were a part of his word and so we're just an expression of eternal life in this age so we're not granted it we are it we have it we're a part of it and it's just a natural thing for us and under the new birth what happens is the life the eternal life comes into our body and it quickens us and it makes us live the way that we were supposed to live but it takes a salvational experience it takes a new birth experience to remind us of who and what we are but I look at both groups and I say that's Grace because listen God's allowing people into his house that aren't his family and that's Grace to them but it's Grace to me because if we go by what I live this in this earth and what you live in this earth we don't deserve eternal life this is nothing about deserving it but rather we were a part of it and that's why we get to have it amen it's a beautiful thing but John concluded all this he says you can't love unless you've been born of God and you know God and then Jesus comes along and he says it's only my true church that gets to experience this we talked about how he said to the disciples to you it is given to know to understand to be a part of the kingdom of God he says they don't do it and that's why I speak to them in Parables that's why it's riddles to them is because they're not meant for it you're not they're not part of that group but I want you to catch what the prophet of God would say in the token message here because we can think that because we're under the hearing of the message that makes us bride and I believe God has given us a message to call out a bride but not all that hear it are are members of the Bride there's lots of people went to Brother Braham Services there's lot lot of people went to Jesus services and were not in the upper room and never came into a new birth experience listen to what the prophet of God said this is for us he's preaching the token now he says don't just come this far and say I believe the message he says you obey the messenger and what does that mean he says come into Christ because remember here what the spirit saith unto the churches it's not just to hear it but it's to understand it and it's to take it into your life and Obey it and make it a part of your life to say I've recognized that Malachi 4 has come is not mean you're a member of the Bride you've got to obey the messenger you've got to obey him because the Holy Spirit speaking through him trying to get us back into Christ trying to get us back into our place of origin he says so obey the messenger coming to Christ you say well I believe every word said brother Brandon I believe you're a prophet I believe every word you said that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you he says when I see that I will pass over you he says now you got truth but you got to come to it different than just something to be hollering about and I believe in hollering about it it has got something to to holler about But be sure you approach that with the very depths of sincerity if you live a different life than what you should live he says keep still until you get that life he says when it gets to living in you then it's automatically you don't have to put it on and then we're going to talk a bit about that this morning we don't have to put this on we don't have to to try and make it happen this is something that ought to be flowing out of the believer's lives each and every one of us amen remember we read that quote last service where brother bam says that that you can that that Satan can impersonate every gift and then he said these things that we're talking about have to be God sent and God born I'll just take the clips here so we can read it he says Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word he can't build up a Believer he can't he can't create Us in the stature of a perfect man he can't change us into the word because he's a thief and a liar and a a Tormentor and a destroyer he can only break us down he can't build us up he says that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden and that's where he's always failed and then he he says Satan can impersonate but then he comes to us and he says you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be godsent and God born imitation only cause confusion he's not saying it's impossible to imitate them he's saying the imitation will never work we've got to be able to say I am where I am and thank God for where we are but don't rest on where we are but say there's more for me because the word says there's more for me amen there there there are there are aspects as we go into this today I mean every time I read the charity chap chapter it causes you to question where I'm really at in your Christian walk in my Christian walk because the standard is so high but you got to realize that this is the more excellent way it's the way of perfection Perfection is the standard that's the standard is perfection and we'll get into why maybe perhaps we don't hit the mark all the time but but I I I'm not trying to break down our confidence this morning but I'm getting us to say Lord there's more for me I want to go high Lord I want to step into what this really means to be in the Holy Ghost to have the Holy Ghost living inside of me amen because the preaching of the word ought to call us to a higher level absolutely it ought to call us to a higher level and it ought to wash out the things of our life that ought not to be there so let's go into this charity chapter in 1 Corinthians 13 and Paul says this he says though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels that's so that that's speaking of though I though I can preach though I can give a sermon though though I have a great delivery and of angels though I speak with tongues though I speak in other languages though I have the gift of those things he says and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol now that that that phrase sounding brass and tinkling symbol doesn't mean much to us today but you got to realize in the old days they use these things to draw attention and that word in the Amplified says I'm only a noisy gong or a clanging symbol now I think most of us have been intelligent enough not to buy our children a drum set especially with symbols why because that's the loudest noisiest most irritating sound if it's not played correctly and if you ever watch a drummer play the symbols are minimized rather than maximized but Paul says if I have all these things these tongues these gifts and I don't have Divine love I don't have a gape love I am like a Gong a noisy gong amen you if you've ever given a child something like that you don't have to give a child something like that they'll find something that hits another thing and it makes a loud noise and they love it they love it and they'll hit it and hit it and hit it until you want to hit them that's the way it goes because why it's somebody that's making sounds but not making music amen there's no rhyme to it there's no rhythm to it there's nothing about it it's just drawing attention to them but it's not it's not doing anything for the hearers Paul says if I do all these things and I don't have Divine love I don't have the Holy Ghost it's as if I'm beating a Gong next to you and guess what nobody likes a Gong nobody has a Gong in their house for their family to play on a regular basis there's nothing about a Gong a Gong is meant to draw attention amen but it's meant to draw attention it's meant to compliment rather than just be a loud loud banging sound amen it's selfish it's egocentric it's it's childish to beat on a Gong with other people around it's not polite it's not the way to do things but what does that mean today what because you know you say well what is that what is that going to look like in my life or in our lives prophet of God puts it this way he says when the World Council and all that's going on today that says the days of Miracles is passed the great powers of God have been taken out of the churches they seem like anymore they don't have nothing but a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol he says we know that to be the truth he says it's a form of godliness and denying the power thereof that that's what it means to be a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and then he'd repeat that that scripture we just said and he said see it's nothing it's nothing listen Church Pentecostal he says it's nothing it's a hybrid seed it can't come to the word it's all noise but no results it's all lips and no life it's all words and no Works amen it's all words and no walk it's lots of things coming out but it's not actually doing anything it's not producing anything lasting it's not producing anything Eternal and what does he say it's because it's hybrid they've Blended something else in with it and all it becomes is a show it becomes a noise it becomes a a you know a circus whatever you want to call it amen what's he saying you got to have the Holy Ghost you've got to have this Divine love to lead these things in your life to take them to where they need to be otherwise it just becomes a performance of your side and that's never going to work it's never going to work and ultimately these things fail and we see them fail like I said I've spent so quite some time looking at different denominations and seeing what they're doing and how they're doing it and some of them have amazing I I was watching a service the just a little while ago and you talk about beautiful they got like eight people on cameras walking around they got light shows going on their sound is perfectly synced everybody's in Perfect Harmony in the music for an hour and a half and then they do a 20-minute childish sermon but beautiful we couldn't touch it guys coming down you know and sister Morin's playing on the piano and they're coming in and they're zooming in on the beautiful hands perfectly manicured you know great great jewelry on right just setting a mood wonderful lighting and with is it ikabod is written over the door the glory of the Lord has departed and all they've got left now is a production but what a production Church what a production it was fantastic I was in awe I can't imagine the money and time that they spent to get that service to that level of perfection and yet the Holy Ghost isn't there but what a beautiful thing but there's a more excellent way there's a more excellent way Paul's talking about himself Paul said says though I give he didn't say you he said though I give Paul's looking at himself and if there's one thing I want us to get this morning look at yourself I'm not looking at you I'm looking at me when I preach this you you study this you talk about knock you back a bit this humbles me to to read this sort of thing the prophet of the age says though I do this and don't have it I'm nothing that means though I do it and then I don't have nothing either I am nothing these different things he says though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing you know there was something Brother David said last week last weekend when he was talking about flipping the the uh the words around to give it an effect and I did that here and I'm going to give you the inverted revision this is the Jonathan klet revision to this just to to punch this up a little bit and and go this way and say and if I have not charity I am nothing even though I have the gift of Prophecy understand all Mysteries all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains if I don't have this Divine love and I have every single one of those things I am nothing I'm nothing listen we believe in the Supernatural we believe in the absolute Supernatural power of God we believe it in this church we've prayed for things we've had healings we've had Deliverance we've had things cast out of people in the last couple of months we have seen the Lord move in lives we've seen provision we've seen all of these different things coming through we've prayed for things and they have happened we have asked for things and God has given it amen we have seen the hand of God moving and we see things changing and we love what God is doing in our midst now now I haven't heard anybody that has a gift of Prophecy here as far as I know but if somebody were to raise up in this congregation and they would say thus sayeth the Lord and they would give a prophecy and it would happen and this happened time and time again we'd say praise the Lord that person would gain a measure of respect probably and appreciation that they didn't have before because we'd say the spirit of the Lord is upon them they've got a gift of Prophecy in their life and that would be an amazing thing wouldn't it that would be an amazing thing and and maybe I would stand here a brother Grant or some other minister would get up here like brother brandham and somebody would come up with a tumor or something and we laid hands and that tumor would drop off well we couldn't stay we wouldn't be able to stay in the seats of course we wouldn't the the V ible Supernatural hand of God doing something if if if crossed eyes were straightened or an eyeball was put back in I was listening to um um uh God in Simplicity this morning and brother Bram says Lord we thank you for what you did for that woman that had a shortened leg and a shortened foot she had a shortened leg straightened in service you talk about the power of the Supernatural and Paul's saying though I have all of this I have nothing without this Divine love many times you you know we talk about the the third poll and spoken word and and scriptural and word authority and casting out demons and sicknesses run immediately before our prayer and things happen as soon as we call on it and we think that that is what we're looking for and that's going to be the proof of us being the great elect bride and Paul says you can have all of that and be nothing the thing is are we looking for the ex ENT way or are we looking for the more excellent way because the more excellent way will challenge you way more than the excellent way absolutely it's a challenge for you on the inside because it's not just a work now but it's something where you've got to surrender and you've got to die out and you've got to give where you don't receive amen it's something coming out of you it's something flowing through you as opposed to something that builds you up listen I'm going to be honest if I if some some person came up to here to and there's a tumor and I prayed and it fell off that would I I'd be on a high for a year not because I did it but because God answered our prayer in that kind of a way but let's be honest I'd probably take some of that to myself in some way or some fashion it would probably connect to me and you know what this is streaming you know what that could share if that happened on live video that' get shared around the world 30 million times eventually and what would it do it would boost me up but that is not what Christ is looking for in a bride the glory is supposed to go to him the worship and the praise is supposed to go to him and so what we love about all these things he's talking about gifts of Prophecy understand all Mysteries come up here preach the lights out and you're like whoa he knows so much it's all me people look at me but when we get to charity the way it's meant to be preached it's only Christ because you're so far out of that picture it's not going to make you look good in the way that we want to look good many times it's going to cause you to humble yourself it's going to cause you to lay yourself down it's going to allow you to be offended it's going to allow you to be hurt and there's no glory in that and that's the way it's supposed to be there's no glory in this amen the Excellence remember we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency may be of him it's him from start to finish amen amen listen we look look Judas is scariot have power over sickness and demons let me put it this way Judas scariot probably had greater signs and wonders than I ever will balum had a greater gift in terms of the supernatural than I probably ever will and yet neither one of those men was a child of God but they had something that Paul was talking about here they had signs and wonders they had gifts they had prophecy they had all of these things and yet in their soul there was nothing to reflect God and it led them down a path and that's why we read later there in in 1 Corinthians 13 He says these things will pass away they'll stop they'll fail because eventually we're going to get ourselves interjected into it blended into it it'll hybridize it and it'll die because that's what happens without the Holy Ghost in our life as we start making it about us amen the question is this because remember we have excellent to more excellent if you lead with excellent you'll never get to more excellent remember signs and wonders these signs shall follow them that believe you've got to come into a place of believing before they can come we don't lead with signs and wonders they follow with signs and wonders and what Paul is saying here is he says you're focused so much on what follows you that you haven't focused on what's get you into it in the first place you got to come to this place of divine love you got to come to this place of Charity amen we're seeking greater demonstration and Paul's saying there's a more excellent way than demonstration and if you get that then the demonstrations will follow follow behind listen to this he says don't judge a man because he can pray a prayer of faith for the sick and they get well don't judge a man because he might do some Supernatural Miracle as being a sainted person but the only way that you can judge the only way that you can judge is by the love that they have for Christ and for each other oh I love Christ do you love your fellow brothers and sisters one and the same it's the same body it's all Christ he says and do you see what the Holy Spirit has to bring to the father that we're all separated no love for each other he's speaking on adoption much in the series on hear ye himym and he says that's what the Holy Spirit has to take back the tutor has to take back to the father is that they love you but they don't love each other something wrong somewhere he says the world wants to see a display of love what's Paul telling us he's saying when God gives you the Holy Ghost he gives you the greatest gift you can ever get it's not prophecy it's not tongues it's not interpretation it's not healings it's not Faith it's not Mysteries when he gives you the Holy Ghost he gives you the greatest thing he can give you and without it all those other things will fall by the wayside and they'll fail they won't take you anywhere not that you don't have a genuine gift but the soul is not sealed and that means that you're what potentially going to be controlled by something other than the Holy Spirit of EV cuz it's not sealed somebody else can come in and out somebody else can can can take control over you amen whereas you you may never lay hands on the sick you may never raise the dead but you'll live a life that nobody else can live and that's the first sign of the believer is the life that they live not the things that they do outside of that it's do you live according to the word and that takes the holy spirit in your life we commented on this before last service but to read it again in Matthew 7 he says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity Paul was just repeating what Jesus said when he said though you have all those things and you don't have Divine love you're nothing he he didn't make this up this is just repeating what Jesus said and Jesus said without me your works are meaningless without me you're going to go in the wrong direction it doesn't mean you're not going to do works but they're not going to be in line with the will of God and if you don't have the Holy Ghost the will of God is foreign to you you can't find it because you don't have that Compass inside you don't have that guing and you're it's like shooting in the dark you might hit something but you're never going to hit the target and you're never going to hit the target in the middle that's for sure just blindly shooting in the dark cuz there's no light to guide you there's nothing to show you where you're supposed to go brother man puts it this way in power of transformation he says iniquity is something that you know you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but you won't do it you know they should stay with the word of God but for the church's sake or somebody else's sake or something else you'll stray from the word of God and do what the organization says well I don't know my church says we should do it this way and I believe it this way see and it's right before you that you shouldn't do it that's iniquity he said depart from me ye that work iniquity look at the great St Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 He said though I speak with the tongue of men and angels He says now you want or somebody want to lay on to that like it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost Paul said though I speak with tongues like men and angels and have not chair cherity excuse me like you all have here among you he says I'm nothing you can speak with tongues yes because it's the word a preacher can take this word and go forth and preach it and say that word and that word will grow he can can preach and the word will have an effect on the people I am a testimony of this you know what happened in our church in Texas and that we had a pastor that was living a double life and he preached and we grew under that Ministry but listen to what he says but the preacher could be a hypocrite himself genuine gift genuine word preacher a hypocrite he says it's the word see but the true living creature of God takes all of the purpose he says the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out he says and you add something else with that you've got a perverted plant we've got a fully restored word now there is no room for ignorance anymore God used to wink at ignorance now he doesn't wink at ignorance scripture says right that's what the prophet was supposed to do Malachi 45 and 6 was a restoring Angel he's restoring the word back to us and then in Revelation 10:7 there's an open book that he that that that that's given over and he is there and in the days of the voice of the seven Angel The Mystery of God will be finished everything's done everything's revealed and manifested as it was supposed to be so this Angel is bringing back a restored word a full word so that what we can have a full word effect because that's what they had in Paul's day was a full word and it had a full word effect and now it comes down to the Omega Church Alpha and Omega and we have the same word and it's supposed to have the same effect the difference is we're growing up into it they started with it so for us there's a slide up into it for them they were just there boom they had it and it was manifested and they were the the the peak they were the lion they were the the power the muscle of God if we wanted to put it that way amen but but but now we have a message that's returned and it's supposed to be restoring a bride back and so the people have to hear that word to be restored back you can't be restored back if there's nothing to be restored too if you don't realize there's a restoring needs to happen you're not going to be restored you've got to hear that word and so we come in and we hear this message amen but just because we hear the message like I said that doesn't make us a part of the Bride sitting in this church does not make us a member of the Bride this is an individual Affair from start to finish it's an individual Affair amen we've got to be personally born again we've got to personally receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit not just sit in anointed services not just sit under anointed preaching but we've got to be anointed ourselves on the soul and sealed so that we're a finished work and then from there God starts to use us amen and as soon as we have ourselves sealed then he fits us into the body and then he fits this that that'll be the local body and then the local body gets slotted into the grand scheme the full body the global bride of Jesus Christ but he starts individually and then he puts you into a bigger group and then that bigger group gets slotted in to the full thing amen but sitting in our church doesn't make us Christian having Christ in US makes us Christian that's the key to all of this so Paul continues in 1 Corinthians 13 he says and though I bestow all Goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing prophet of God says this he says see all your good works all your good deeds all the spiritual things you have all the gifts you have all the sensations you have all the joy you have all the peace you have has nothing at all to do with it to begin with he's saying without the Holy Ghost those things mean nothing cuz the Holy Ghost is the source for all of those things the true source course if I could put it that way he says look at all those gifts all those good things I feed the poor I got a good heart about me I do this I do that I go to church I speak with tongues I prophesy I heal the sick I preach the gospel I do those things Paul said still I am nothing all those things can be carnally impersonated listen if we're going by work sister Teresa has us beat gave her life to the poor children of Kolkata I think it was right for going by works but what Paul's saying is you need to be LED in how you do those things you need to be led in how you give we don't just give cuz somebody has a need somebody somebody has a sometimes somebody has a need because they're off the word and all you're doing is throw money down a pit if you give it to them sometimes somebody is sick because they're out of the will of God sometimes people are in a mess because they've gotten themselves into a Mess by getting away from the word so you can't help them out because you're in a right place they got to get in the right place to receive the blessing to have God take care of their need that's what they've got to do amen we've got to have discernment for these things like I've said before you don't just pray cuz somebody wants you to pray a certain way you pray as the spirit leads you to pray absolutely 100% and that's something I'm learning more and more every day is not to say Lord here's the need say Lord what do you want to do in this situation that's what Paul's getting at here is he's saying what's the will of God for your life and all of these things if it's gifts what's the will of God for the gift if it's giving what's the will of God forgiving if it's time energy whatever it might be Lord what would you have me to do with it cuz the key is to be willing to move not to just be moving for the sake of moving we'll burn ourselves out we will absolutely burn ourselves out I've said this over the pulpit how many ministers have burnt themselves out because they feel they've got to be doing doing doing all the time and that's the heart of a servant inside of them but God didn't say you had to be doing all the time he said move when I tell you to move walk in the light as he's in the light as he shows you things to do then do it but don't burn yourself out for the sake of just saying I'm doing something get the leading of God to do those things amen listen we the redeemed that means we're bringing back to a position and with that position comes responsibilities comes a plan comes a purpose and so we've got to say Lord what's your purpose for me as part of your Redemption cuz he bringing us back to a place where we can be a part of our inheritance and we can do something with it Amen brother B puts it this way he says you're not a real Christian you're not a real genuine product for Christ if you don't love him in everything that you've got within you I don't care that whether you look pretty whether you don't you love him and you express yourself that's when you two become one and that's when Christ and his church become one not by denomination not by baptism not by Sensations not by nothing but a real love you were brought from the bosom of God when he was wounded there and he bought you and your love and your tress and your loyalty proves what you are your love your tress your loyalty proves what you are he says I don't care if my wife wouldn't ever comb her hair if she didn't wear a pretty dress or never there she'd be my sweetheart I admire her because of sorry I admire her because of her loyalty her virtue what she is that's what she is and by a Christian men and women that's what we are in the sight of God it's not because we can go to the best church or we can dress best or we can get in this neighborhood or we can do this or can ride in this or do this or that that doesn't have one thing to do with it it's the virtue of our loyalty and our love to Christ he says and that's the birth and though I speak with tongues of men and angels I am nothing though I feed the poor though I give my goods though I do this and do that and do that I am nothing he says what does Christ care about all what all you can do and what all you can do like that if that real genuine love and loyalty isn't there he says think of it won't you Paul's talking about Kingdom position and he's saying you got to take everything you are everything you've been given and bring it subject to charity bring it subject to the Holy Ghost bring it subject to the Divine Purpose because the Divine Purpose is love it's for the good of those you're going to do it for and we see Jesus Jesus did some things that hurt Prophet Paul did some things that hurt people but it was for love remember they had that that man in the church that that that wouldn't straighten up and Paul said kick him out let his let his body be destroyed for the saving of his soul hard hard hard and then Paul comes back and he says now that he's repented bring him back in and he says I did this for his sake but it hurt me so bad to do it but he said I had to do it cuz that's the only thing would work on that brother and it did but I can guarantee you that brother when he was being put out of the church didn't think that that was love but it was love so sometimes it's a feel-good love and sometimes it's a spank but it's always Divine love and we've got to bring everything we have subject to those things amen we're coming into Perfection now imperfection it's not enough to try it's not enough to try Lord I did my best because what you're under the perfect headship now of the Holy Spirit where you're led by God it's not enough to try you've got to do and you got to do as you're led to do amen we can't just do what seems good to us and sometimes we rest on The Laurels of being a messaged believer and this and that and the other thing and we forsake seeking the leadership just assuming that because we're a Believer we automatically know that our first inclination is always the will of God it isn't it isn't I'm telling you it isn't just because you feel that way immediately does not mean it's the will of God you always check it with the word first thing we do see I I've talked about this before we go to prayer and we don't check the word and what happens is you get a leading in your prayer and it's opposite to the word something's wrong somebody else answered your prayer you go and you run it through the word and then when youve got a direction in the word you say Lord is this what you want me to do in this situation cuz in many situations you can go different routes through the word sometimes it's a harder approach sometimes it's a softer approach sometimes it's a hands-off approach I don't do anything sometimes we get so involved with things we think we've got to act and all God's wanting us to do is you keep your hands on off this this is mine to deal with I don't need you messing the situation up again I'm speaking of myself you can do you cannot do or you can do it in a way that's not even right remember scripture says there's a way that seeth right to a man and the ways thereof are the ways of death he didn't say that that's that's the unbelievers no that goes for all of us we're still fighting a flesh we're still fighting memories and these different things and so every aspect of our life has to be brought subject to the holy spirit amen we're in the Capstone amen not just trying but this is the age of doing this is the age of being this is the age of producing brother man puts it this way he says Christianity ain't what you say it's what you live what you do it's an example he says you're the salt of the earth Jesus said you give Caesar them things that belong to Caesar you break that speed law out there and what are you doing you're doing wrong you sin we have any speeders in here this morning he says give Caesar what's Caesar's and God what's God's you say well the Law's wrong speed limits too too low cars are safer now I can safely do 130 everywhere and not have a problem he says I can't help what's wrong what wrong it is it's wrong to break Jesus commandment and if you don't give Caesar the things that Caesar then you did what Jesus told you not to do and the trans transgression of the law is sin he say is that right yep we're all guilty we do it we got one raised hand and a couple smiles we all do it we we listen we can we can put any spin we want on it we do things we ought not to do by the law and even by the word sometimes we're in a battle we're in a battle we are all guilty we do it but when you see yourself wrong stop it why people are watching you people won't go to church but they'll read you and see what you do so get Christ in your heart remember I told you about you know the Lord dealing with me about you know being hard on people when they're driving poorly do you know brother Steven Dole in in Alberta he posted something the other day he says out of the 8 billion people in the world I'm the best driver how amazing is that you know that's kind of what we think right but the way the Lord dealt with me on is he said what if you give somebody a hard time and then they show up at church or they see you if somewhere else say oh what do you do oh I'm a pastor oh wow I really want to come to your church maybe I'll sit outside and honk the horn during your next service right it's it's a it's the only testimony I might be able to give that person is how I respond on the street and it might break any other testimony I would give them if I get to meet them in person outside of a vehicle so he said how are you going to be a pastor of that Community if you're acting like the rest of the world in your car right okay occasionally I'll give them a beep just to let them know they're supposed to do something I tell my wife I'm communicating I'm not yelling but the idea is to be tempered in it right he says so get Christ in your heart Christ and the holy spirit's the same thing Christ means the anointed one and the Holy Spirit is that anointing and you are the one that's anointed and it's Christ in you anointing you see what I mean you're Christ you're an anointed one you're a Christ not the Christ a Christ CU Christ just means anointed one he was the Christ we are many little christs little anointed ones Little Messi hates he says when you do that then you've got the right thing then he can use you to anything he wants to use you in cuz you're in the body and subject to any of those gifts but see to have one of those gifts outside of the body it would do you no no good that's why I said earlier Paul said you're putting the CP before the horse you're putting your Excellence before your most Excellence he says you got to come the most excellent way and he he reads all of that scripture all over again I won't read it because we've read it 19 times now but he says see don't depend on those things the holy spirit is a being it's God okay that's wonderful God in you the person God that's Liv F your whole entire being he says you're changed you're a new creature any little thing that's wrong he'll tell you that's wrong then quit don't do it father I didn't mean to do that you forgive me see and that's the Holy Spirit I don't care how much you spoke in tongues how much you run how much you jumped how much you did this that or the other see whatever you done it wouldn't Mean a Thing If the Holy Spirit wasn't in there to condemn you on the things that's right and wrong I don't like that that word condemned cuz it's conviction for the believer but you know what he means he says you can do all those things and if there isn't a correction a correcting factor in your life something's wrong amen we we we preached on these Services about these attributes but what we forget in the end is that the first work of the holy spirit is conviction first thing it ever did was convict right repent that's the work of the holy spirit is repentance you turn around and then it he starts working on you sanctifying your life in these different things and it's so easy for us sometimes to forget that just because we've been given this truth doesn't mean we don't still do things we ought not to do that we don't get off the path that we don't get caught up in different things and they start to take over our life we've got to be able to say when things are wrong Lord I'm wrong and repent remember the Zeal of the age is to repent I was thinking this thought this morning you know and and and we we when we we look at the message and we look at these great Mysteries and everything but a and we tend to focus on the bigness of it but when you hear the actual message it is I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire and white rment Godly character and the righteousness of God that's what he's trying to get you to that's it and the rest of this is is a take it or leave it meaning you may have some of it you may not have some of it but in the end he's trying to get us to the place where we reflect him that's it and how he gets that what Ministry he gets it under what church he sits you under whatever it may be that means less than the effect and the thing is he's going to get you where you need to be to have that thing happen inside of your life amen we'll see how we go through through these things how that God just is developing character in us just constantly it never ends it's a constant growth but we we United here we said we read that quote where he said these things have to be God born and God sent because what they're making way for God himself God doesn't live in a house that's made out of things that God doesn't bring it's a godb built house so that God can dwell inside of these things amen and it's all under the headship of Christ the Holy Spirit that's where we're going with it brother Braham says this in the God of this evil age he says also notice Christ's word bride is heading up word bride he uses that he ties that together a lot because why she's got to be the word the same as Christ was the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and if that word came one time in flesh the next time it comes it's got to be the same way it's a word bride we've got to reflect the word not some man's idea he says and we can see where the Antichrist is heading it began back there and now coming to a head an ecumenical council will put it in an ecclesiastical head and the little church that's come along little never been about the numbers he says also Christ's word bride down Through the Ages coming to a head cuz she's going to be United back to its mate always just like the church and everything else it's got to unite the wheat everything else comes right back to its head where it started from he says like Cain and Abel there was something started there was a lineage started in Cain there's a lineage started in Abel you say Abel died you didn't have children we're talking a spiritual lineage one that would come according to the word and one that would come according to man's ideas one that would get mad at the word and one that would humble themselves to the word he says it's a word bride heading up in the person of the word of God brother Braham said we read that quote he says I'm I'm teaching you to be a Dwelling Place of God and brother braham's now coming around and saying this word bride is the person of the word of God made manifest in this evil age that we're living He says see where it's heading up so we're we're speaking on charity we're speaking on coming to Perfection and it's not just about attributes it's not just about treating people nice but it's about a manifestation of the word and we'll see as we go through this as we get into this series deeper and deeper that this Divine love is not just how we treat people but it's the it's the resurrection it's the Rapture it's Heaven it's rest it's all of these things and it's not just an effect but it's a place and it's a thing it has substance to it what we have here is just a taste a shadow of what the Holy Ghost really is and you'll see as we get into this amen this is bringing us back into perfect unity in Christ and the thing is this the reason why he focuses as we get into this where it says It suffers long and all these things we're Earthly creatures but we're going back to the heavenlies but while we're on Earth we have to have an Earthly effect we can't be brother BR say you're you're you're you're so spiritual you're of no earthly good there has to be an Earthly manifestation there has to be an Earthly effect of the word in our lives it can't just be to get us out of here it's got to do the same thing it's got to be the same thing that Christ was while he was here on this Earth and so we look at this in 1 Corinthians 13 as we start to wind down he says charity suffereth long okay I made it through there's that and again and is kind I made it through but how did everybody else make it through next to you did you rip them apart did did did impatience overcome you did stress and these things overcome you so that you made it through but everybody else is lying bleeding on the floor next to you cuz you made it through but you RI them apart when you're doing it that's not charity charity suffers a long time it can deal with things and it's kind while doing it you can be kind in your suffering he says charity envieth not you're content with who you are and you're happy for what others are even if they have more even if they have more even if they have what you'd like he says charity vaunteth not itself it is not puffed up the Holy Ghost in us doesn't make us a big shot ever remember we read that that quote and we talked about an arrogant spirit is never of God because it doesn't bring Glory this doesn't bring glory to you charity does not lift me up it does not lift you up he says it does not behave itself unseemly means it's not conceited or rude seeketh not her own that means you don't insist on your rights that's a tough one that's a tough one we've read that quote many times brother Braham says a man has done you wrong he's justly done you wrong meaning he truly Did You Wrong how do you react charity brings him before the throne of grace and mercy right natural love will put him right in his place and pin him down and call for judgment he says it's not easily provoked not touchy or resentful I can be touchy I can get irritated easily but you know what changes that getting in the presence of God sweetness comes from the presence of God and if I'm out of the presence of God if my prayer life isn't the way it ought to be if my devotions life isn't the way it ought to be if I'm not spending time with God I get touchy touchier he says it think no evil that means it takes no account of evil done to it that means that if I could go to brother Paul and I could slap him across the face he'd come right over tomorrow and help me shovel my driveway he wouldn't think anything of it he'd shake my hand he'd still come to church he said do whatever he could for me because charity doesn't take account of what other people do remember if we're defined by the actions of other people then they're our Master right if I if what you do determines how I act then you're my master that's a scary place to be he says it rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth it beareth all things it Bears up under everything it handles every load placed on it it believeth all things now that one means ready to believe the best of every person and this is a tough one because you have to blend that with discernment cuz I can believe the best for you but that doesn't mean you are where I want you to be and so I've got to have discernment about those things but here's the thing sometimes we want to believe the worst rather than the best and that's a reflection of us not a reflection of them cuz remember charity is charity is in me it has nothing to do with you and it's in you and it has nothing to do with me so my thoughts towards you are a reflection of me not necessarily of you if charity is in my life he says it hopeth all things and endureth all things the Amplified says it endures without weakening so we read six verses and for an internal show of hands how many have all of this all the time not me I look at that and I don't want to prophesy negatively I've never had it I don't have it and I won't have it all the time cuz why why Earth and vessels Earth and vessels and that's the thing as we look at this and and you say I can't do it I'm saying I can't do it I haven't done it and I won't do it something's going to fail but the thing is and and we won't touch this so much the service the scripture says charity never faileth it didn't say you'll never fail it says charity never fails when the Holy Ghost is truly in control it never fails but the problem is is we take control back and we get caught up in life we get caught up in the situations you know it you say well I was tired and I lost my temper I couldn't help it as we become adults as we mature we can see things coming on I I Marvel sometimes not sometimes all the time at how the mother's handle it I mean in our home we handle it maybe a bit differently when it comes to kids but if a child wakes up my wife goes and takes care of it I have my ear plugs in and I sleep through the night and I'll say oh I had a great night's sleep how was that oh you know so and so was up three times and peed his bed and did this and I'm like oh I had a great sleep I got an hour and 10 minutes of deep sleep and 8 and 1 half total hours and and she's dying over there and it's easy to say I'm tired therefore I have a right to respond the way I do but when we recognize we're tired we have an option cuz we can sit there and we can claim our right as a natural human being to have an off day don't we we can do that or we can say Lord I'm tired but you're the god of my body you're the god of my mind you're the god of my spirit you're the god of my soul and so I'm asking you to take this tired body and fill it with love for today but to stop and say that to stop and recognize where we're at and say Lord I'm going to surrender my right to act tired I'm going to surrender my right to be frustrated I'm going to surrender my right to be stressed and I'm going to ask you to take control of this Earth and vessel one more time and let charity flow through me rather than my own indignation or my own rights or my own this that and the other what you're saying is Lord I'm going to ask you I'm going to voluntarily let you know I can't make it today and I'm going to fail so I'm asking you to step in and help me not to fail and that's a conscious decision that's a conscious moment that's a conscious prayer to have in these things amen for the sake of others Lord will you help me rise above myself cuz if we're not stepping into Perfection then what's the point of it in the first place if it can't have an impact on us when we're at the low point then what's the pro what's it all about if God can only work with us when we're on the highs then what's the point of it you you'll understand when I say I don't need God in the highs things are great I do but we feel like we don't need him in the highs but if he's not the god of the and he isn't God acting in the lows as much as he is the god that got us to the highs then he's not God at all so the failure is not in God the failure is US asking him and say Lord you see me I'm at the end of my rope I'm at the end of my mind I'm at the end of my patience I'm at the end of my money I'm at the end of this whatever it might be and say Lord I need you now and you'll see that this charity is all about surrender and letting him do the work through you absolutely absolutely Paul and Silas what a what a testimony put in jail they're put in stocks they've got chains on them and they sing and they pray and the whole jail hears it and God sends an earthquake and frees them that's what happens when you give God the opportunity to do something in a situation they're beaten they're bruised they're tired I don't know if you've ever slept in the stocks it's not comfortable chains don't help either and yet in all of that they sang and they prayed and you know what that helped them do when when it freed them they were able to stay in their place just without the things that were binding them they didn't leave they stayed in the prison and they got all the other prisoners to stay there as well cuz remember the Jailer came in saw the cell doors open and Drew his sword to kill himself cuz his it was his life for theirs they said don't worry we're all here don't kill yourself they were able to stay in the trial just without the chains just by simple worship and praise and prayer that's it brother B put it this way he says take the sap out of a peach tree and if you could transfer it by a transfusion into an apple tree the apple tree would bear peaches sure it certainly would see takes its life out of the apple tree take it all out give it a sap transfusion drain from the peach tree over into the apple tree what happens if the peach tree life comes into the apple tree it won't bear no more Apple it'll bear peaches seed because it's got the life in it he says well you take us that's nothing but a wild gourd a not head see and there's nothing to us for we're all dead in sin and trespasses a wild gourd Can't Be Tamed you can't you can't make it grow a certain way he says we're that way we're not heads he says we're all in these kind of condition and then we give we ourselves can prostrate ourselves and give ourselves up until give ourselves up give ourselves up give ourselves up give ourselves up up and surrender and surrender and surrender until there's a space of time before the giving up and what happens next he says give ourselves up until God takes his transfusion tube the name of Jesus Christ because there's not another name under Heaven whereby men can be saved and he transfers The Life of Christ into us then we have this kind of Faith the faith that Christ had he says and Christ's Faith was not based in those Pharisees or Sadducees or in their pots and and pans and their washing it was based on the word of God Amen so much until Christ was the word the word made flesh it's got to be the same thing today he says and then we can get so transfused we can how do you get there give up give up give up give up give up give up give up give up give up cuz what all your life has to drain out so that all his life can fill up and that's a work of a lifetime it is I'm only 44 but it's a work of a lifetime he's not done on me yet and to the testimonies I've had from the older folks he's not done with you yet it's the work of a lifetime he says and then when we can get so transfused by his power that we die to our own thinking he says and our Faith becomes a genuine Faith he says hallelujah then the Life of Christ is transfused into us he says we become living creatures of God a dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can send his radiant blessings what does radiant mean you ever been around a radiant heater a radiant heater doesn't just kick out air it Heats it it it heats the object it doesn't heat the air it heats the object objects in there so if you've got a garage that has a standard forced air heater it just runs air through it and it heats the air but a radiant heater actually puts the heat into the objects that's the way it works he's saying when he does this in your life you start to take effect on other people it's not just the atmosphere it's the people around you get a blessing out of it he says can send his radiant blessings down through there he says and we're in the stature of Christ he says and now we've put the blood of Jesus Christ in and that thing brings the faith of Jesus Christ remember I said before this is the quote I've been referencing for a while but I didn't read it he says you've got to add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge and your knowledge Temperance he says now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in there's been a transfusion the life is in you now he says and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controls you and your feet are the foundation Faith amen he says controlled by the head there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues we're talking about charity we've had Faith we've had virtue and knowledge and he says that's yours but when charity comes in when the Capstone comes down when you're filled with the Holy Ghost it takes what you got it and it turns into what he has and you didn't have that before as great as it was it came from God it was of God but now it is God that's the difference when you get the Holy Ghost it's God working through you you are his hands you're his feet you're his lips you're his body you are everything that he has need of Earthly because he's living in you he's the head and he's controlling you what a beautiful thing when you realize that the faith I have if you have the Holy Ghost the faith I have is the literal faith of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ if he can bear it you can bear it because the same thing that he had is what you have inside of you the exact same thing no difference except the measure that's it what's he talking about he's talking about letting the Holy Spirit just permeate every aspect of our life every single bit that we have every aspect every thought every emotion every idea every sensation every action every reaction he's saying just let the Divine love of God flow through you it's the Holy Spirit flowing through the believer Peter would say this he says and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves he says for charity shall cover the multitude of sins remember what he said earlier be kind and tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake ha forgiven you that word fervent there means stretched out stretched out it reminds me of gold remember like I mentioned in Revelation 3 we're told to buy gold tried in the fire that's beaten gold that's purified gold and what is it it's Godly character now gold there's a gold has a special property and gold is the most malleable of All Metals now malleable means it's able to be reshaped under pressure and able to be drawn out or stretched without breaking so that means that you can take a a piece of gold and you can stretch it and stretch it and stretch it and stretch it and it doesn't break so I looked this up brother Matt and I were looking at some of this last night one gram of gold so that's a piece of gold the size of a of a piece of rice a piece of rice can be stretched for 3 kilm brother Dale's house I looked it up just before service by roads is 2 and 1 12 km so a piece of gold the size of a piece of rice can stretch from here to brother Dale's and still have room to go another 500 m one piece of rice of gold can go 3 km when they take it they beat it and it takes them two weeks to beat this gold down and they they they start with a thicker piece and they just keep breaking it down breaking it down and when they do it they get it 500 times thinner than a human hair that's how thin it is that's how perfect it is and take that one piece of rice and you flatten it out and it will cover this entire Pulpit one piece of rice in a thin film 500 times thinner than a human hair you know how he said he said there that charity covers a multitude the multitude of sins why it can stretch without breaking and it can cover way more than you think it can you take a piece of aluminum and try and do that it'll get about this big before it breaks but gold you can stretch stretch it and stretch it and stretch it for all intents and purposes you can't outstretch gold practically speaking it it'll hold on longer than you can hold on if I could put it that way amen but what was amazing was they said the gold that's worked by human hands that's worked by a person rather than a machine it doesn't break up the way it does if you beat it with with a machine the person working on your character develops it better than anything that anybody else could come up with God's got a way to develop our character and it's a molding and a shaping and a beating and no machine they can come up with can produce it the way that a human working with it can that's the finest gold that you can get and what's Paul what's Peter saying he's saying when we have this kind of love it can go a long way and it can cover a multitude of sins listen when Christ died he his Divine love gave us his blood and it he shed it on on Calvary and that covered every one of our mistakes but that was the fountain you say brother John I've just got a little bit of the Holy Ghost a little bit of the Holy Ghost will cover every sin of every person in this church that's what I'm saying it'll stretch way more than you think it can stretch and when you've got that kind of love in your life you can take a lot more than you think you can but you got to grow into it and you got to let him mold and shape it and beat it and grow it to cover the multitude of sins notice he didn't say a multitude of sins the multitude it'll cover anything there's nothing that you can't put under that blood fervent charity fiery charity active charity living charity a hug is easy forgiveness is hard a hug is easy praying for somebody Did You Wrong is hard a hug is easy having somebody out that doesn't seem to like you that's hard this thing is working it's got a life it's boiling up brother Brandon would talk about this dream that a woman had and and and she shared the dream with him and it was a dream and there was a big rock box and there was a man that kept pouring boiling water into this rock box and when he was pouring the water in it would it would come up and it would as of course as boiling water so it's cleaning out the inside of the box and all these sticks and dirt and everything are coming out but the water keeps running out because the Rock Box isn't sealed and so she she she the the cracks weren't sealed in the box so it could hold the water up to a degree but you had to keep pouring in to keep the water overflowing but as soon as he stopped pouring the water in then it would just fall out through the seams and the cracks and she said to brother Braham she says I know it's a spiritual dream but I don't know what it is and I don't know what to do with it and brother R says this he says then she asked why the Box didn't hold it and the man said that's not water that's the Holy Ghost and nothing will hold it and said then when he went back and got another big bucket and it was full of honey and he poured the honey in there and said now it will hold this and she thought that the box was a rock box was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and held it this box had been trying to hold the Holy Ghost the water for so long but it couldn't do it he says and then he took a big bucket of honey and poured it in and all of a sudden it could hold the Holy Ghost it could hold the water he says so therefore the rock this latterday Pentecostal Church which has received the Holy Ghost they did at the first he's talking about Pentecostal meaning the true Pentecost not the denomination okay he's talking about us he says all down Through the Ages they received the Holy Spirit but not in the measure they have it now because it's a restoration of the first and as we take the candlesticks Alpha and Omega how they lit the first candle it went Higher and Higher and Higher and got dimmer and dimmer and then it come back again he said first and last and so forth he saying as it was in the days of Acts in the book of Acts so it is in the end it's Alpha and Omega it's Christ in the beginning it's Christ in the end and in the in the middle it's not Christ because he demmin the people pulled away from him and he couldn't be expressed but he says now we've been restored to that so it's Christ at the end the way he was in the first he says now in this church age the message is being poured into the church this Tabernacle will say he says that's where she comes to church this Tabernacle and he's talking about the building he says is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there's no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they're Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in the body a group he says we've got people with the Holy Ghost but the church collectively doesn't have it and the church body doesn't have all the Holy Ghost what's he talking about he's saying there needs to be a Unity of the Body for the body to hold the Holy Ghost he says therefore it runs out but but what this man was pouring the water the messenger to the church was pouring the message into the church and what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it that's what the Holy Spirit does is it boils it up now so that's sanctification it's the Holy Spirit and it's working in you and it's working on you but it's not staying in you it's just going through you and then it leaks out the cracks it has a work but you need constant working of the Holy Spirit to keep your life clean CU you don't have it sealed up yet your life isn't sealed and so the Holy Spirit just flows through you in and out in and out he says now the honey represented Brotherly Love brotherly kindness he says which is this age now listen to this he says now you might say look I sure don't like brother Neville or I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother so and so and something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart is broke it just nearly killed you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another he says but to maintain in a group of people he says why do you you care for that brother he says it's because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with them he's your brother he says and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with he says be you kind of just stay you kind of just stay away he says which you oughtn't to do but shun him a little and in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister he says I'm an old man I was once young and now I'm old I've seen it down through the age people do that here people say I just won't have no more to do with him and something happened to that man it nearly kills him he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see he says it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks we covered that service on brotherly kindness and I didn't bring that here cuz I wanted to bring it here to say that that is the peak that's the peak that's the final thing and it comes in this final age that brotherly kindness and brother B would call it brotherly love it's not charity but it's brotherly love and he's saying you think you can't love like that you can cuz this is the age for it this is the age where that gets added back into the church collectively but that's the final thing You' got to get before you can hold the Holy Ghost where you can treat your brother and your sister the same no matter what you know what they said about brother brandham you couldn't tell his friends from his enemies I say God help me to to live a life that looks like that where you wouldn't know that I'm having a hard time with you or not and that I wouldn't know whether you're having a hard time with me or not now some of that can come by us just saying you know what I'm not going to get caught up in how they act if they're acting weird to me then I'm just going to let it go I'm going to keep acting the way I'm supposed to but if something's off then you push through and you say I'm not going to let you go brother I'm not going to let you go sister you're my brother you're my sister we've broken bread here he's talking about here communion table I've washed your feet I'm not going to let you I'm I'm not going to let Satan put a wedge between me and you he says when you've got that he says the Holy Ghost can fill that kind of a person sometimes we're looking for charity and we don't have the the brotherly kindness the brotherly love that he's talking about but it was interesting to me how he was talking about that that that messenger pouring in the message of the hour pouring in the Holy Spirit and people come into church and that's what we get we get the word taking effect and it's washing us and you get anointed services and the moving of God in the service and then what happens is you walk out and 6 hours later or 12 hours later or 18 hours later or 24 hours later you're back to what you always were cuz you can't hold the Holy Ghost you haven't come to that place you haven't been sealed brother Bram says we've got to come to the place where it's not just in you and it's not just in me but it's in the body the whole body because remember this isn't just about individuals but it's getting the whole body in unity under one head which is Christ the holy spirit amen when we get that the Holy Ghost doesn't just pour in but it stays in so then you walk out of service and you got something to give you got something to pour out you got something that people can draw from and drink cuz it's hot in here but it cools when we go out and it can it can help somebody it can it can sat it can satisfy somebody's thirst it can respond and now you've got something to pour out when the situation gets tough when you fail something inside of you is still available meet the need amen if the musicians could come I said this at the start the first work of the holy spirit is conviction and we come into this charity and now it's about don't let other people hold you back don't let other people Define how you're going to operate don't let other people tell you how to do things but let something inside of you tell you how to operate and doing that You' got to give up and give up and give up and surrender and surrender and surrender we sing that song flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me that's what this looks like is if it's going to flow through you then you can't put up resistance you choke a pipe down to real small you can only put so much through it but you got a nice big open pipe with no no obstructions or anything water just flows through that I I I've seen where they they have these big dams you know big hydroelectric dams and they've got these flu in there and they've got these these channels in there that they open from time to time but what happens is if they haven't been opened if you haven't had a a Revival in a while then all the mud and sticks get packed into those channels and so what do they do every now and again they open the door and they just let that water pressure build up on that and then pretty soon it almost looks like somebody's squeezing mud out of a tube and it just comes out and it kind of drops down but then as it starts to move quicker it starts to move further out and further out so all of a sudden just go it' be 60 80 100 150 feet of water and mud just shooting out and what's it doing it's cleaning out the flu cleaning out the channels so the water can flow sometimes that's what we need we need something to come in and clean out the channels amen we say Lord It's been stagnant Lord it feels a little clogged up I need something to clean me out I need something to Bo boil me out I need something to wash me out I need something to clean up those channels that are holding back that love that's supposed to flow through me and then when they do it it's just clean pure water just shooting through there and if you stood in front of it it would knock you down when they first open it it's just mud that's just dripping over the edge bloop bloop but as that pressure builds up and that channel gets opened up now when it comes out it'll flatten a car the power of that water that's what we're supposed to be a power of God working through through our lives let's stand as we read this last quote Paul said let us go on unto Perfection let's keep going let's keep pressing brother BR says this he says let's leave this convention if it be the will of God with so much love and the divine power of the Holy Ghost in our life until it changes every motive that we've got and molds and shapes Our Lives into the form of Jesus Christ that's my prayer is that your prayer this morning Lord that you would mold me and shape me that you would clean me that you would make me a vessel where your Holy Spirit can flow through me and produce the kind of love that people need brother BR says the world is looking for a display of love that's what they need not the love that they call for the love that he has he says and if you can do that it'll make a difference that's what's going to draw people it's not our Doctrine it's not the way we dress necessarily it'll be the life it'll be the love of Christ flowing through us that draws us he says we're the salt of the earth and that love is a Savory thing for the Earth for the people of this earth when they can see us react and do things in a way that they know they don't deserve they say how do you do it it's not me but it's Christ that's in me amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we are but vessels of clay and Lord Satan would have us look at the vessel Lord and he'll beat us down with the lumps and the bumps and the this and the that and the faults and the failures but Lord you chose us Lord you've made us a place for you to dwell and Lord our prayer this morning my prayer for myself Lord is get me out of the way Lord help me to yield myself help me to surrender myself help me to give up my rights Lord help me to give up anything that would hold you back from showing your grace your mercy your glory your presence your reality to somebody else Heavenly Father Lord having come into this this place Lord having come into a a position of Rest In You Lord let us draw others Lord your word says we'll draw all men unto you Lord help us to do it with our attitude with our actions and reactions Heavenly Father Lord Lift us into a higher plane Lord and help us where we know we're falling short help us where we feel Lord we don't have it in US Lord may we go to you for strength Lord to be refilled Lord to be re-baptized to be re-energized Heavenly Father Lord to have a newer and greater experience in the Holy Ghost than we've ever had Lord
