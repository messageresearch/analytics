[24:25] you every single one
[24:28] amen and that's why we pray for each
[24:30] other and that's why we support each
[24:31] other and you notice that like I came
[24:35] across the saying that that is common
[24:38] among the Jews and that is it's the
[24:42] responsibility every Jew to look after
[24:46] each other and you know the conflicts
[24:49] that they've been through excuse me over
[24:52] over the years and they look after each
[24:55] other like goes with them it was the
[24:57] same the spiritual Jew isn't the same as
[24:59] the body of Christ amen so we pray for
[25:02] each other we uphold each other because
[25:06] of the grace of God

[43:24] a man
[43:31] [Music]
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:36] and by night we're living water slow
[43:45] a man trust her singing the truth a man
[43:51] that well god knows a man he knows the
[43:54] heart man sees one thing God sees
[43:59] another a man
[44:01] God knows one thing our man knows one
[44:03] thing but God knows at all a man so as
[44:07] like he said in the word it's a warning
[44:09] and he said he said my ways are not your
[44:13] ways I mean they're my thoughts yours
[44:15] but as the heavens are higher than the
[44:18] earth so are my ways higher than yours
[44:20] my thoughts higher than yours that's
[44:22] what we got to come down and we got a
[44:24] home allow ourselves from that God
[44:25] reveal it a man and they've got and and
[44:29] what God is looking for in arles is that
[44:31] he's asking us to believe it a man what
[44:34] he reveals believe it's not whether you
[44:37] understand it intellectually but do you
[44:39] really believe it in your heart that all
[44:41] things are possible
[44:43] amen see so brother there's one thing to
[44:47] say another thing to do to go and bring
[44:50] forth the life of one that believes all
[44:53] things are possible a man is not what we
[44:56] want well what God wants a man by the
[44:58] grace of God so the Lord blesses and
[45:01] grace to those that the pray they prayed
[45:05] for concerning the sickness and our
[45:07] brother Jeremiah and our brother in
[45:10] Ontario the God of all grace I pray be
[45:13] with them and like I said I've received
[45:17] emails for prayer requests and with
[45:20] different problems different needs but
[45:22] brother it's going to increase please do
[45:27] we believe it do we believe what the
[45:30] prophecy concerning the germ warfare or
[45:33] do we think that we're going to overcome
[45:35] the germ warfare our way no no we got to
[45:39] do it God's Way and remembering this
[45:42] this is a challenge to our faith a man
[45:45] he said is going to come upon all not it
[45:49] didn't believe the message could come
[45:51] upon all without the baptism of the Holy
[45:55] Ghost
[45:56] Amen so brother you can't you could try
[45:59] to you know help yourself this way up
[46:01] yourself that way that way that way
[46:03] focus on the natural but it's getting to
[46:06] a place where the only thing that's
[46:08] going to help us is the eternal a menace
[46:11] the eternal revelation of God the
[46:13] eternal word a man so brother is serious
[46:17] God is challenging our faith brother as
[46:21] he say well when he comes will he find
[46:22] faith on the earth I believe I mentioned
[46:24] in the one or two previous sermons there
[46:27] that the thing that that bothered Jesus
[46:30] so much and troubled him so much was the
[46:32] lack of faith believe us the how this
[46:36] you know and he said oh ye of little
[46:38] faith and so on so if he was considering
[46:42] dental faith then what's he considering
[46:44] now old brother in this hour we're in a
[46:47] few will be saved so the grace of God to
[46:50] his brother that we're going to believe
[46:52] God please in the name of Jesus let's
[46:55] believe the word it is written let's not
[46:59] let the devil talk to us let us talk to
[47:02] the devil a man and I believe brother
[47:06] Bob referenced the preacher that would
[47:09] say that mood to the devil you know but
[47:11] most people are falling falling short of
[47:15] that and they're falling prey to the to
[47:17] the boo from the devil not to the devil
[47:22] it's to that it's it's from the devil
[47:24] that is the absolute truth rather the
[47:27] devil is there and he's boon for this
[47:29] he's boon you for that but where's your
[47:32] faith rather Jesus gave us the example
[47:36] Jesus told us what to do
[47:38] Jesus told us how to deal with those
[47:40] situations he said what what is it it is
[47:43] written it is written and so on and
[47:45] though she said man shall not live by
[47:48] bread alone when the devil tempted him
[47:50] to turn the stone to bread and so on and
[47:53] all mine we're living in a world that
[47:56] would be glad to do it because they want
[47:59] more bread and they want more this to
[48:01] want more of that and so on Jesus
[48:03] rebuked them even at forty days after
[48:05] that fast and he God got hungry he says
[48:08] you can turn to
[48:09] the bread he can he could but he because
[48:13] like I just reminded us a little while
[48:16] ago that that twice he fed so many
[48:19] thousand with so many loaves of bread to
[48:22] fish yeah and and so he coulda be slits
[48:26] and the devil knew he could she could
[48:28] turn the stone into bread well brother
[48:31] is but it wasn't the will of God a man
[48:34] that was the devil tempting him
[48:35] no brother sister listen no matter how
[48:37] how good sometimes the devil is tempting
[48:39] us with this and this this makes sure
[48:41] it's the will of God amen what is the
[48:44] will of God that Jesus wouldn't do it
[48:46] because he was going to be the example
[48:48] for generations to come
[48:49] you and me amen any and he said all this
[48:53] and this and this and if you fall down
[48:56] and worship Me he said you you you can
[48:59] worship not even no one but God only a
[49:01] man by the grace of God so you got to
[49:04] come back to the devil with the word the
[49:07] MU is the word a man and it says get
[49:11] thee behind me Satan it is written a man
[49:15] by the grace of God even and sometimes
[49:17] you know as Satan you can say I'm a
[49:19] believer I'm a Christian if sometimes
[49:21] Satan can still control your head and
[49:23] your thoughts and your voice some of the
[49:25] things you say oh yes most definitely
[49:28] but you got you got a case why he was
[49:30] using Peter and he to discourage Jesus
[49:34] he was using Peter to get Jesus do this
[49:36] get Jesus to do that a man way and Peter
[49:41] said you know do this do that and and
[49:43] Jesus acknowledged that it was the devil
[49:46] just think of that
[49:48] it was our beloved PA Apostle Peter and
[49:52] what power that he had an anointing and
[49:55] when the Holy Ghost came but brother
[49:57] during this during this this part of the
[49:59] Ministry of Jesus Jesus looked at Peters
[50:02] he get thee behind me Satan thou
[50:03] savourest not the things that be of God
[50:05] a man old brothers sister we need to be
[50:09] more conscious not just in the message
[50:11] we need the conscience of the devil
[50:13] because I don't know that he's coming
[50:15] down with great wrath knowing his time
[50:19] is short brother sees that his actions
[50:22] are based on his
[50:23] what he knows and and what he know and
[50:26] why does he know it he knows of what we
[50:28] know a man by the grace of God he knows
[50:31] that because of what we have done and
[50:33] what we are doing things we separated
[50:35] unto the Lord by the grace of God
[50:37] staying with the word
[50:38] leaving the church world not condemning
[50:41] the people now the devil would love to
[50:43] get you to do that a man he would know
[50:45] no just keep you're headed to right your
[50:47] spirit right a man Jesus did any man
[50:50] they and Father forgive them for they
[50:52] know not what they do
[50:53] a man so like and Jesus attitude to
[50:56] where Peter was was was good a man and
[50:59] he confirmed the love of Peter for him
[51:03] a man so brother the grace of God to us
[51:07] and especially in this hour please lord
[51:09] help us to believe not just a doctrine
[51:12] but to believe what the Prophet warned
[51:14] us concerning what's coming in these
[51:17] last days so brothers don't don't just
[51:20] assume everything's fine I believe the
[51:22] message I got I don't had no worries no
[51:26] Jesus did all the worrying yeah the
[51:30] Bible says he was tempted in all points
[51:31] like as we are yet without sin a man
[51:35] heady and he fell on his knees not my
[51:38] will thine be done just think the
[51:39] Messiah God in flesh acted that way a
[51:42] man why because he was identifying with
[51:46] you and me he's identifying with the
[51:48] Saints down through the ages when the
[51:50] tests would come a man and then remember
[51:53] the father says the bride's gonna stay a
[51:55] while and he said what force because
[51:57] God's going to test these things amen
[52:01] test the attitude of the bride and so on
[52:02] but by the grace of God please you're in
[52:06] the flesh so makes you make sure that
[52:09] it's God in your heart controlling your
[52:11] spirit and controlling your thoughts and
[52:13] your your actions because the devil is
[52:16] their work it's a great war how much a
[52:19] much greater is that war now that it was
[52:21] a may as the was in the Alpha ministry
[52:23] so it is in the Omega ministry because
[52:25] that was God in flesh and the devil knew
[52:27] it now is God in flesh it's in the end
[52:29] and I an scripture is fulfilled a man
[52:33] and he know he knows this time is short
[52:35] and so he's going to be a
[52:36] enos tackiness taking us deceiving us
[52:39] deceiving and one of the Bowser's be
[52:41] sold so close they would deceive the
[52:43] very elect if possible that's bad so
[52:47] just don't assume everything so again
[52:49] too many assumes that I'm a Christian
[52:51] I've been baptized I go to church but
[52:53] Paul said make your calling and election
[52:55] sure amen and we did we daily do that
[53:00] amen in our relationship with the Lord
[53:02] Jesus Christ amen
[53:04] and what in our relationship with him
[53:06] getting getting more and more power over
[53:08] the devil because as God is there Jesus
[53:10] is there the devil is there a man but he
[53:13] God as Jesus is working on our souls and
[53:15] our spiritual eyes with the in on our
[53:17] physical lives a man if things get worse
[53:20] out there
[53:21] brother I tell you more and more when
[53:22] he's go to be weakened in their faith oh
[53:26] yeah when it comes to faith in God amen
[53:30] we kind of trusting God for the problems
[53:33] that you might have trusting God for the
[53:35] needs that you might have amen but I
[53:38] tell you many believers are compromising
[53:41] and many believers are going to
[53:43] compromise more and more what for
[53:45] because they want more and more and more
[53:47] satisfaction in the world a man where
[53:50] God's going to make it very
[53:51] unsatisfactory you can allow the devil
[53:54] to do that so that we want to get out of
[53:56] here amen it's the same thing with the D
[53:59] with the Jews in Egypt the the Egyptian
[54:01] bondage a man and and it got this way
[54:04] got that way good this way so finally
[54:06] they wanted to get out again and I got
[54:10] to keep reminding you the Prophet says
[54:12] you'll go when you want to go amen but
[54:15] there's too many not wanting to go not
[54:17] hungry go not thirsting to go they're
[54:20] just they're just going well I believe
[54:22] the message that I'm just waiting for
[54:23] the rapture
[54:24] no the raptures waiting for you a man by
[54:27] the grace of God brother you were
[54:29] looking for rapture it's him you you're
[54:32] looking for this it's in you you're
[54:34] looking for God to meet this need it's
[54:35] in you but people believe it's there no
[54:39] no it's here amen
[54:41] so a Redemption wasn't over there it was
[54:43] in Jesus a man and he knew that what he
[54:47] was enduring what he was suffering was
[54:49] what it was the enemy
[54:50] lady what he had on the inside a man
[54:53] that's the truth and the enemy is
[54:54] fighting what God has revealed to us
[54:56] concerning the end and the resurrection
[54:59] the coming of the Lord the resurrection
[55:00] of the rapture amen
[55:02] so I'll tell you this brother this
[55:03] serious and again there's no wonder no
[55:07] wonder that like Jesus when they find
[55:11] faith and what is that faith I don't
[55:13] know if you noticed it or not but I
[55:15] agree I agree with our brother Scofield
[55:17] and I know brother Branham did their
[55:20] faith is he said it belief not just
[55:24] belief in God no no he said it is belief
[55:27] in the whole body of revealed truth this
[55:32] is amazing
[55:32] that God would anoint that brother he
[55:35] was an atheist brother Scofield he was
[55:39] an atheist he was a lawyer until one day
[55:41] that God dealt with him and he became a
[55:44] Christian amen and he and
[55:47] O God took over in his life he really
[55:49] repented he was really changed he became
[55:52] a new creature in Christ a man and he
[55:55] got ready to the word a man and he went
[55:59] from Genesis to Revelation and brother
[56:02] and that's that's when it comes to the
[56:05] the book we use sometimes it is like the
[56:09] Scofield addition of the of the
[56:11] scriptures with the notes and this is
[56:14] this is what I have here and it's the
[56:15] notes are by Scofield and the power of
[56:18] God had the same thing and now and I'm
[56:22] like I said in one one there in Matthew
[56:23] it's amazing one of the scriptures in
[56:27] Matthew there and Scofield is listing he
[56:30] listed seven item seven things that what
[56:34] God was going to do down through the
[56:36] ages and in the end and the prophet of
[56:38] God listed the same thing and seen one
[56:41] of the messages and brother BAM this to
[56:43] dis this this this but he added more to
[56:46] it yeah we Scofield went were seven
[56:49] brother ham went on with maybe 14 15 I
[56:53] don't know but a lot more than what God
[56:55] was doing because we're in the reality
[56:58] of it and our brother Scofield was just
[57:00] looking ahead he
[57:02] had the full revelation a man but thank
[57:04] God for the revelation that he had a man
[57:07] and not not denominational and and our
[57:10] brother was about way back in the early
[57:12] nineteen under said he did what he did
[57:13] brother and I'm it was God almost
[57:17] definitely it was it was the Lord a man
[57:20] and and again brother Brennan did
[57:22] highlight another version of the
[57:24] scriptures that that not burden not
[57:27] beyond the King James but the notes that
[57:29] the brother put included and so on and
[57:32] and he said maybe it'd be better he said
[57:34] if I if I used that that brother's
[57:37] translation of the of the Bible a man
[57:40] but he stayed with Scofield and brother
[57:44] his belief in the whole body of revealed
[57:46] truth when the Son of Man comes is he
[57:48] going to find belief in the whole body
[57:50] I'll reveal truth not not just a portion
[57:52] of it all of it amen by the grace of God
[57:56] and again to remind you of the prophet
[57:57] of God said that he said your actions
[58:00] speak louder than your words amen and
[58:03] that's the truth so God God be merciful
[58:06] and help us so that we're born again and
[58:09] we're bringing forth the actions of that
[58:12] born-again believer sons and daughters
[58:15] of God we're bringing for the actions a
[58:17] man of Christ in eternity by the grace
[58:21] of God because we are one with him
[58:24] that's tremendous praise the name of the
[58:27] Lord Jesus not just the historical
[58:29] figure
[58:29] it's the present-day truth its Christ in
[58:33] you the hope of glory
[58:34] it's Christ with us it's craziness hey
[58:38] man it's Christ revealed his word to us
[58:40] amen
[58:41] to be that we're gonna be caught up into
[58:44] the marriage supper of the lamb by the
[58:47] grace of God what their marriage supper
[58:50] is desperately as that's up to God
[58:53] they're there like I said one time the
[58:56] believers came into my house and and
[58:59] they were shocked and amazed because of
[59:01] a picture I had there and it was of the
[59:04] it was of a supper table and and they
[59:09] went out and went and told somebody else
[59:11] they said listen listen
[59:13] he said I think he said brother
[59:16] journalist said believes he said in an
[59:18] early in a real supper as someone a real
[59:21] Mary there's very suffer of the lamb
[59:24] I kept but to them it was spiritual
[59:27] brother the spiritual the natural types
[59:29] of spiritual a man by the grace of God
[59:32] we are being fed spiritually and I'm not
[59:34] dying when we give there will have
[59:36] something to eat as well by the grace of
[59:38] God amen so brother god help us that
[59:41] we're gonna believe it a man that stay
[59:44] with the truth a man and let God control
[59:49] you it's not you controlling God I tell
[59:51] you there's a lot controlling God or
[59:53] trying to control God Amen that's the
[59:56] devil no no no no you can't let God
[59:59] control you a man not my how many are
[1:00:02] willing to say I mean any in any
[1:00:06] circumstance in your life in any
[1:00:08] situation your life say Lord not my will
[1:00:11] do I be done yeah
[1:00:13] then brother brown again said I quote I
[1:00:16] quoted in one of the messages here
[1:00:17] recently where he said is it's not Lord
[1:00:20] do this Lord do that he said you got to
[1:00:22] press your way into the kingdom amen
[1:00:25] God gives you the revelation to create
[1:00:28] the hunger and thirst to go in God gave
[1:00:31] Israel the revelation so that when they
[1:00:33] went down into Egypt there come a time
[1:00:35] when they would remember what God
[1:00:37] promised amen through Abraham Easter
[1:00:40] daily for 400 years and he said that
[1:00:42] I'll deliver them amen but he was
[1:00:45] waiting for them to hunger thirst he
[1:00:47] suffered the cries of my people I have
[1:00:49] come down to deliver them amen so
[1:00:53] brother God has heard the cries of the
[1:00:54] bride and he has come down to deliver Oh
[1:00:57] amen the Lord has come the Lord is with
[1:01:00] us the Lord is in us amen so let's be in
[1:01:03] prayer god help us brother to me to take
[1:01:06] the rapture seriously take it serious
[1:01:10] because well that's what God's requiring
[1:01:12] of us he's not God wanted you to go out
[1:01:14] and do this quote and do that goodness I
[1:01:16] mean no no God now is ragazze requiring
[1:01:19] the the rock rock for faith and the
[1:01:21] resurrection faith a man as it was in
[1:01:24] the office autism the Omega so brother
[1:01:26] and God
[1:01:27] God's gonna do God's gonna allow this to
[1:01:29] happen like that to heaven well for to
[1:01:31] bring out your faith he's gonna allow
[1:01:33] the pressure to come down distress to
[1:01:36] come down and so on to manifest your
[1:01:39] faith to see if you really believe a man
[1:01:42] or see if you're going to compromise
[1:01:44] most are compromising and will
[1:01:47] compromise but there's a few that won't
[1:01:49] amen they'll lay down their lives
[1:01:52] they'll forsake anything they got Lord
[1:01:56] not you might will die and be done it
[1:01:59] praise the name of the Lord so I just
[1:02:02] want to just before we get in go into I
[1:02:04] want to try - grace - of God to finish
[1:02:07] this thought on the grace of God amen
[1:02:11] but before I just want to let you know
[1:02:15] that the Lord willing that brother
[1:02:22] Matthew sent me a link but he's told me
[1:02:23] he sent it to others as well and I might
[1:02:26] play it there in the church concerning a
[1:02:31] brother preaching 40 years ago on the
[1:02:34] Eagle amen and it's tremendous so we
[1:02:38] might show this on the screen here comes
[1:02:43] Tony art you don't see our brother he
[1:02:44] just see the eagle and that was 40 years
[1:02:47] ago so I guess they didn't have the DVDs
[1:02:50] like didn't like we have today so it'd
[1:02:54] be good for us to hear it again
[1:02:55] concerning the Eagles because their
[1:02:58] Bible says you will mount up with wings
[1:02:59] as Eagles amen praise the Lord
[1:03:02] Ron and not be weary walk and not faint
[1:03:05] no no your your it is Christ in you so
[1:03:08] the Lord will then want to take that
[1:03:10] time to play that and there's there's
[1:03:12] another article that brother Alex Emily
[1:03:15] is tremendous and brother New Zealand
[1:03:18] did this article and it's evening my
[1:03:22] fellow ship have lived in New Zealand
[1:03:23] and and he did this article and it's on
[1:03:28] YouTube and it goes from the beginning
[1:03:30] to the end a man and you hit you here in
[1:03:33] the in the background you hear the
[1:03:34] prophet ministry on this thought this
[1:03:37] thought this thought this time this time
[1:03:38] that time
[1:03:40] a man and there's a brother there
[1:03:41] quoting scripture that reads the
[1:03:43] scripture and then the Prophet comes in
[1:03:45] and comments on it Amen so it's good so
[1:03:49] the Lord willing we'll it's really good
[1:03:51] you go right on through
[1:03:53] from-from the age of two me eternity
[1:03:57] down through time back to eternity
[1:03:58] a man the brother did a tremendous job
[1:04:01] in annihilating the scriptures and what
[1:04:04] God has done in these last days amen and
[1:04:09] why God has done down through the ages
[1:04:11] so the Lord willing we want to take time
[1:04:13] for that as well and for the brother on
[1:04:18] us preaching on the Eagles maybe we'll
[1:04:20] have to have to certain we have to
[1:04:22] services for that because he preached it
[1:04:24] twice amen and once he's just over
[1:04:28] around 45 minutes and other time is just
[1:04:31] over half an hour that he's preaching
[1:04:33] and I was looking at a quote where the
[1:04:35] prophet of God said do you realize he
[1:04:37] said that that six know 20 minutes of
[1:04:41] inspirational preaching he said is is
[1:04:45] arter then he said eight hours of what
[1:04:50] was it he used oh the sledgehammer
[1:04:53] he said is it as other than it using you
[1:04:57] know working hard with eight hours of a
[1:04:59] sledgehammer he said and 20 minutes of
[1:05:02] anointed preaching is harder than that
[1:05:04] so he said you understand the ministry
[1:05:07] and he said why the ministry feels a
[1:05:09] certain way and so on he says not easy
[1:05:12] it's tremendous burden because we're not
[1:05:13] dealing with man we're dealing with God
[1:05:15] first then we deal with me a man so we
[1:05:19] know it's not it's not going to be easy
[1:05:21] because even got the prophets had
[1:05:23] problems with it even Elijah had a
[1:05:25] problem you know and he just went on out
[1:05:28] into the wilderness and so on
[1:05:30] and he wanted to die yeah oh yeah he
[1:05:32] wanted to even want to die cuz he when
[1:05:35] God spoke to him he said the Lord I'm
[1:05:36] worse than I'm not it I'm worse than my
[1:05:38] forefathers and they were they're a lot
[1:05:41] better than he he wasn't God encouraged
[1:05:43] him amen so sorry he said Elijah go back
[1:05:46] he's I reserved unto myself 7,000
[1:05:50] amen so brother grace of God to us and
[1:05:54] so we're encouraged by what the Elijah
[1:05:56] was encouraged God encouraged Elijah and
[1:05:59] and he encouraged us with what that
[1:06:03] adage took on a shortened time and me
[1:06:05] you know it's true I don't know I trust
[1:06:07] you see it and I trust this taking
[1:06:09] taking effect in your life in your heart
[1:06:12] in your soul in your mind that you can't
[1:06:15] get away from it concerning the
[1:06:16] deception of the hour we live in don't
[1:06:19] assume everything is fine you got to
[1:06:21] work it out
[1:06:23] amen God God puts it in then God God is
[1:06:27] working it out
[1:06:28] amen by grace the Lord give us the faith
[1:06:32] that really really really pleases you
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] not knowledge but the maquette but the
[1:06:38] yes knowledge but anointed with the
[1:06:40] dynamics a man because it'll come to the
[1:06:44] place it isn't
[1:06:45] he said have come to that place a
[1:06:47] perfect faith he said that it only is
[1:06:50] just said when that hour comes it just
[1:06:51] take he said a man or woman a boy or a
[1:06:54] girl
[1:06:54] he said just stand there and look up and
[1:06:56] say Lord I'm coming home and he said Oh
[1:06:59] sparked the rapture amen and the
[1:07:02] resurrection that's right
[1:07:04] but people are not conscious of it not
[1:07:08] now they're not through the day every
[1:07:10] day oh they just can't do just focusing
[1:07:13] on their their natural eyes let's focus
[1:07:15] on the spiritual not the natural
[1:07:18] everybody's focused on natural looking
[1:07:20] to please the natural looking to satisfy
[1:07:22] the natural make the natural comfortable
[1:07:24] God's gonna make the natural
[1:07:26] uncomfortable oh yes he is so that we
[1:07:29] want the spiritual we want the eternal
[1:07:32] like Jesus got tired of this old flesh
[1:07:35] he was in back there 2,000 years ago
[1:07:38] sure the brides getting tired of it hey
[1:07:40] man so the grace to a sword right that's
[1:07:43] why that the Holy Spirit we don't feel
[1:07:45] it like they did in previous ages
[1:07:47] because God wants us to hunger and
[1:07:49] thirst to get it to go home to be with
[1:07:52] him a man you'll just stop it amen so
[1:07:57] the grace of God be with us and also
[1:08:00] justice
[1:08:01] that where I was having testimonies by
[1:08:08] certain ones in the congregation and I
[1:08:11] did say if there's anyone that wanted to
[1:08:12] give a testimony just feel free to let
[1:08:14] me know and we'll give you the time to
[1:08:17] give you a testimony and maybe we'll
[1:08:22] give our brother Joshua at that time we
[1:08:25] did we as we gave it to our brother John
[1:08:27] and brother Faisal a man and and other
[1:08:30] other brothers here and of course even a
[1:08:33] sister's got got that right to testify
[1:08:36] to concerning the grace of God in their
[1:08:38] lives
[1:08:39] amen so we want maybe to get brother
[1:08:43] Matthew to testify he said no when I
[1:08:47] first asked him amen but he said it
[1:08:51] shocked him so that's why he said no so
[1:08:55] so maybe soon we'll have brother Matthew
[1:08:58] to come up and give a testimony and also
[1:09:01] I did mentioned that we wanted to
[1:09:04] brother Craig the finishes testimony he
[1:09:06] started it in in Al Carlos building
[1:09:09] after quite a number of years ago a man
[1:09:12] so I said the Lord willing was willing
[1:09:15] to get in to finish it so we get our
[1:09:17] brother to finish his testimony by the
[1:09:20] grace of God a man so the Lord be with
[1:09:23] us the God help us is my prayer brother
[1:09:25] a man so again we will the best replay
[1:09:29] those those Eagle messages and also the
[1:09:32] the one that brother Alec sent the link
[1:09:35] to me if it was good amen
[1:09:38] but the brother of mustard he had really
[1:09:40] yet understanding I think he had
[1:09:43] revelation to lay it all out
[1:09:44] amen and concerning brother Paula
[1:09:49] Fontaine I was checking his site just a
[1:09:52] couple of days ago

[1:23:41] grace given unto them it is to every man
[1:23:46] that is among you not to think of

[1:23:57] are all say
[1:23:59] saved by grace through faith a man is
[1:24:05] what God has done with God is doing a
[1:24:08] man so let's not think of ourselves more
[1:24:11] highly than we ought to think this thing

[1:24:16] soberly according as God has dealt to
[1:24:21] every man the measure of faith Alleluia

[1:24:49] one members one of another as their
[1:24:53] oneness is with the father and the son
[1:24:56] so is the oneness with one another in
[1:24:58] the body as the sons and daughters of
[1:25:01] God so everyone members one of another
[1:25:05] what a oneness and everything gifts
[1:25:09] differing according to the grace that is

[1:26:16] he that showed mercy with cheerfulness a
[1:26:20] man showing that you have nothing
[1:26:23] against your brothers and sisters in

[1:31:48] with good and evil is anything this
[1:31:52] country to the word and the Spirit of
[1:31:54] God
[1:31:54] god bless is word you may be seated and
[1:32:00] the thoughts that we have been
[1:32:04] ministering on is the grace of God and
[1:32:09] it has struck me because it goes beyond
[1:32:13] what we refer to as the grace covenant
[1:32:16] and in the study of the word I have
[1:32:20] discovered that grace goes back not just
[1:32:24] through the New Testament but it goes
[1:32:25] back through the Old Testament that we
[1:32:29] refer to as the Covenant of the law but
[1:32:33] it is Grace a man it is Grace they gave
[1:32:38] them the revelation that would please
[1:32:40] God in that day and in that hour before
[1:32:43] the Messiah was made flesh before the
[1:32:46] word came in flesh to redeem them and I
[1:32:48] noticed that grace goes right back to
[1:32:50] Genesis
[1:32:51] and grades go back beyond Genesis let's
[1:32:54] have the understanding the grace is not
[1:32:56] just coming into effect company rather
[1:32:58] into the mind of God or the thoughts of
[1:33:01] God in the Garden of Eden because of sin
[1:33:03] but grace was in the mind of God before
[1:33:06] the foundation of the world in the
[1:33:08] beginning God created the heaven and the
[1:33:10] earth
[1:33:10] a man period just think of that he
[1:33:15] created it in the in the beginning and
[1:33:17] then as I have ministered on a number of
[1:33:20] times and he had a plan he had a purpose
[1:33:22] and he had a pattern and you go on to
[1:33:25] Genesis 1 and 2 and here is the plan and
[1:33:28] the bourbons and the pattern of God is
[1:33:30] beginning a man but Genesis 1:1 it just
[1:33:34] tells us that God created the heaven and
[1:33:36] the earth it doesn't tell us how long he
[1:33:38] took a man but now when it comes to
[1:33:41] changing the earth and doing this to the
[1:33:43] earth and the universe then it tells us
[1:33:46] that the first was the first day and the
[1:33:49] evening in the morning were the second
[1:33:51] day and the third day well one day with
[1:33:53] the Lord is as a thousand years and a
[1:33:56] thousand years as one day so was that a
[1:33:58] 24-hour day or was that a thousand years
[1:34:01] a man so we just leave that with the
[1:34:04] Lord but when it comes to the creation
[1:34:06] as that's just changing the earth and I
[1:34:08] just sitting the earth out / antimony as
[1:34:10] sitting the earth up for human me but
[1:34:13] when it comes to the creation in the
[1:34:15] beginning God created the heaven in the
[1:34:17] earth period
[1:34:18] it doesn't say how long he took God God
[1:34:21] spoke the word and this happened and
[1:34:23] this was happening we don't know it
[1:34:25] could have it could have been with it
[1:34:27] within a few hours it could have been
[1:34:29] within a million years
[1:34:30] you know science thinks in the Bible the
[1:34:33] Bible is country due to what they think
[1:34:35] is scientific proof no no no the truth
[1:34:39] the prophet of God told us he said
[1:34:41] listen he's a true science and he said
[1:34:44] and the word he said blends together
[1:34:46] true science and the word he said agrees
[1:34:49] together and he highlighted this in
[1:34:52] Revelation in Genesis chapter 1 he said
[1:34:55] science says oh God took this this this
[1:34:58] many million years to create the heaven
[1:35:00] and the earth and he said then dance
[1:35:02] science that go back to the Bible and
[1:35:04] said
[1:35:04] oh but the Bible says he took six days
[1:35:06] and so on no no it's a the Bible just
[1:35:10] says in the beginning he did it and
[1:35:12] period amen
[1:35:14] but then it was it was like this they
[1:35:16] within a certain condition so God came
[1:35:19] down to make it livable amen
[1:35:22] so how long he took that's up to him but
[1:35:24] but there's grace we go back beyond
[1:35:27] creation and there was grace and the
[1:35:29] mind of God there is grace or the
[1:35:32] thoughts of God there was grace in the
[1:35:34] plan of God and the purpose of God and
[1:35:36] the pattern of God amen
[1:35:38] brother sister we're going to read the
[1:35:42] word we're going to listen to the word
[1:35:43] we're going to study the word in the
[1:35:46] spirit alternative is it's going to bear
[1:35:48] witness of the grace of God amen because
[1:35:51] divine law projects Greece and Greece
[1:35:54] predicts the fee or the revelation of
[1:35:56] what God has done and what God is doing
[1:36:00] amen and what God will do and all the
[1:36:04] way down through that Greece was
[1:36:06] president divine love is projected grace
[1:36:08] Old Testament New Testament and right to
[1:36:11] the hour that you and I are living in
[1:36:13] and that grace has projected the faith
[1:36:16] that haven't even needed but walked
[1:36:21] around but he not needed and what and
[1:36:25] what Abel needed a man but Cain rejected
[1:36:29] but it was by grace through faith that
[1:36:32] Abel offered the more excellent
[1:36:35] sacrifice a man the virus tells us all
[1:36:38] by faith Abel did this by faith they did
[1:36:40] this by paint yeah but where do their
[1:36:43] faith come from he came through the
[1:36:45] grace of God because it is by grace
[1:36:48] through faith that we are saying it is
[1:36:50] by grace through faith that God gave
[1:36:53] Abel the revelation that he needed JEA
[1:36:55] gave no other than a revelation they
[1:36:57] needed in that hour of judgment amen and
[1:37:00] it is by grace through faith
[1:37:02] amen that what he taught me to hate man
[1:37:05] to what we've gone Alleluia oh by faith
[1:37:10] Enoch was well it was Radford Enoch was
[1:37:12] transported and that we wouldn't see it
[1:37:14] God just took him off the face of the
[1:37:16] earth well brother that's still great
[1:37:18] amen Enoch ahead just like just like
[1:37:21] Adam any and just like Cain and Abel
[1:37:23] Enoch also and what he had a choice to
[1:37:27] make because God revealed himself to
[1:37:30] Enoch and Enoch believed God amen and
[1:37:33] Enoch walked with God he not was
[1:37:36] thinking God he not was concentrating on
[1:37:38] God he not was desiring to please God
[1:37:41] hinata to this if there was anyone that
[1:37:44] was humbled it was he not because there
[1:37:46] is no other way Norway for God to reveal
[1:37:49] himself in Enoch and through Enoch the
[1:37:51] way that he did but that he had to have
[1:37:54] that humility to recognize God to Humble
[1:37:57] himself in the presence of God amen and
[1:37:59] to recognize that he needed God and he
[1:38:01] needed the deliverance amen
[1:38:03] he needed the love of God he needed the
[1:38:05] grace of God and brother the Bible says
[1:38:08] that he not walk with God and he was not
[1:38:10] because God took him a man and if he
[1:38:13] walked with God a man what was he doing
[1:38:15] here because doing what Jesus was
[1:38:17] instructing us to do he was walking in
[1:38:20] the light a man he didn't just come into
[1:38:22] the light no no he walked in it a man
[1:38:26] and what was he responding to he was
[1:38:29] responding to the faith that the light
[1:38:31] was revealing amen
[1:38:33] walking the light as he is in the light
[1:38:35] walking the spirit as he is in the
[1:38:37] spirit you talk about a oneness that
[1:38:40] Enoch had with God and again he was the
[1:38:43] seventh from the first Adam and I sure
[1:38:46] maybe in this message on the message of
[1:38:49] grace and there was another message that
[1:38:51] brother been referred to Enoch but he
[1:38:54] kept saying he know it was the seventh
[1:38:56] from Adam from that Noah five seven who
[1:38:59] know one seven from the one second from
[1:39:00] Noah
[1:39:01] but then in the next message or two he
[1:39:03] apologized he said I'm sorry
[1:39:05] he said Enoch wasn't the seven from Noah
[1:39:08] he was the seventh from the first animal
[1:39:11] and we are the seventh from the second
[1:39:14] Adam any men even our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:17] and so as Enoch was raptured so he said
[1:39:20] now we're going to be raptured by the
[1:39:22] grace of God see we got to recognize the
[1:39:25] Word of God ain't man we gotta recognize
[1:39:27] that's grace brother I tell you this
[1:39:29] divine law approach that is great
[1:39:31] and grace is going to reveal to us what
[1:39:34] God wants us to know God your grades are
[1:39:37] going to reveal to us what God wants us
[1:39:38] to do grace is going to reveal to us
[1:39:41] what God wants us to say amen and where
[1:39:44] God wants us to go oh it got great grace
[1:39:46] is there to give us the faith that we
[1:39:48] need a man and brother we're living by
[1:39:51] faith the believer lives by faith amen
[1:39:55] when I leave me buddy Saint but living
[1:39:56] by faith no matter what you do you're
[1:39:58] doing you're doing it but it's the
[1:39:59] revelation of God amen as I said
[1:40:02] concerning that brother that worked in
[1:40:05] Ontario there as a director in a large
[1:40:08] Hospital but he was a believer and he
[1:40:11] wasn't close to a church and he quit his
[1:40:15] job as a director and he went to any any
[1:40:18] move to Alberta near it close to a
[1:40:20] church for for his sake and for his
[1:40:22] family's sake and what did he what was
[1:40:24] his job II took the job of a janitor and
[1:40:27] a man brother God and sometimes God
[1:40:32] challenges the same way a man what is it
[1:40:35] well Lord whatever your will is I'll do
[1:40:37] amen it's not what I want to do is not
[1:40:40] Lord what what the devil wants me to do
[1:40:42] is what you want me to do and Lord and
[1:40:45] if it means the less money I'll take it
[1:40:47] it means less of this less friends I'll
[1:40:51] take it and if it means sometimes it
[1:40:53] might mean I got to do this they got to
[1:40:55] do that I got to bear their second
[1:40:57] barrier well that's fine Lord amen that
[1:41:00] might that brother quit that as director
[1:41:02] of a hospital brother how many is going
[1:41:05] to do that and many believers are are
[1:41:07] quitting this and quitting this for the
[1:41:09] Gospels sake for the kingdom of God's
[1:41:11] sake and for the message say think a man
[1:41:14] there's not many doing as they can so
[1:41:17] that they can be close to a church amen
[1:41:19] they can be close to a federal
[1:41:21] fellowship with other believers amen
[1:41:23] so find the will of God brother as we
[1:41:27] find out in the Bible week we could take
[1:41:29] one example after another in the
[1:41:31] scripture concerning the grace of God
[1:41:33] revealing the faith of God to this one -
[1:41:36] that one - this one amen
[1:41:38] to get him the in the will of God amen
[1:41:41] brother sister and oh my god
[1:41:45] chiana's if not just believing this and
[1:41:47] believing there the Bible says forsake
[1:41:50] not the assembling of yourselves
[1:41:51] together and much more as you see the
[1:41:54] Day approaching and we're getting to the
[1:41:56] place where believers are fellowshiping
[1:41:58] less and less and less amen
[1:42:00] because they're more intercity in the
[1:42:03] pleasures of this world
[1:42:04] normal Anderson in their holidays and
[1:42:07] they want to do this they want to do
[1:42:08] that what about God a man where's God in
[1:42:11] church because we brothers are somewhere
[1:42:14] where they don't have the revelation of
[1:42:16] the greatness of eternity they don't
[1:42:18] have the revelation of the greatness of
[1:42:20] a new body they don't have the
[1:42:22] revelation of the greatness and the
[1:42:24] beauty and the power and the anointing
[1:42:26] of the atmosphere in the kingdom of God
[1:42:29] brothers satisfied with this atmosphere
[1:42:31] we're getting down to a place where
[1:42:34] we're going to hate an age sin as God
[1:42:36] ain't a man might agree with Almighty
[1:42:41] God however the law that we're going to
[1:42:43] hate sin hate the pollution of this
[1:42:44] world we want to get into the kingdom of
[1:42:46] God brother we're through that we're
[1:42:48] going to please the the new creature in
[1:42:50] Christ I'm born again I'm the son of God
[1:42:53] I'm a daughter of god you're a daughter
[1:42:55] of God a man so now you want to get in
[1:42:57] into an atmosphere where the sons and
[1:42:59] daughters of God are enjoying it and
[1:43:02] there and more happy and old mind their
[1:43:05] their fellowship with God they love God
[1:43:07] to fellowship with those outside the
[1:43:09] city and so on oh it's wonderful but but
[1:43:12] again not many guy that attitude
[1:43:14] not many God that hunger not many God
[1:43:16] that thirst listen I appreciate some
[1:43:18] years ago
[1:43:19] in on Topsail Road there and concerning
[1:43:23] lonesome
[1:43:24] oh so lonesome a man and the private
[1:43:28] acharya just rode that road that little
[1:43:30] poem and because he said when he was
[1:43:32] young and he sent along some old so
[1:43:34] lonesome for that far away southwest and
[1:43:37] where they were this where there's
[1:43:39] something there's something deepens in
[1:43:42] the west on the mountains there and so
[1:43:44] on concerning the the sun and the and
[1:43:46] the shadow and so on but why would why
[1:43:48] did he really did he write that as
[1:43:51] young man because there was many years
[1:43:53] later that God called him hey man
[1:43:56] brother that might have might have been
[1:43:58] in the in the 1920s and that he rode
[1:44:01] that but again it was in 1962 that God
[1:44:04] would be in the n62 y'all Late Late 62
[1:44:07] that God began to lay it on his heart to
[1:44:10] move from east to west amen and he was
[1:44:14] hungry and he was searching to go where
[1:44:17] where's any any eventually after 97 62
[1:44:21] he moved to Jeffersonville Indiana a man
[1:44:25] RJ Jerrod not Jefferson Hill from
[1:44:27] Jeffersonville to Tucson Arizona a man
[1:44:30] brother why you see this is God in the
[1:44:34] beginning God created the heaven in the
[1:44:35] earth and him and his grace went for was
[1:44:39] going forward with him amen
[1:44:41] because main we needed with him Ray was
[1:44:43] the grace of God him we have met him
[1:44:45] through the faith he wrote he wrote that
[1:44:47] poem amen
[1:44:49] why was he lonesome also lonesome
[1:44:51] weather for the faraway Southwest in
[1:44:54] Tucson Arizona hey man he didn't realize
[1:44:57] that but a brother in the late sixties
[1:45:00] God began to put him make it a burden on
[1:45:02] his heart and so on oh there's other
[1:45:04] things I could say about it but what was
[1:45:07] it because it was in 98 it was in
[1:45:09] February 62 that the the pillar there
[1:45:12] not the pillar of fire but the angels
[1:45:14] came down a man and it was just outside
[1:45:18] of Tucson Arizona and by the grace of
[1:45:20] God we were there a man in that area
[1:45:24] where the pillar of fire came down that
[1:45:27] a when I when I was yeah when I was in
[1:45:29] in the States in 1997 and and we went
[1:45:33] went to through sauna and we went to
[1:45:34] where the angels came down and we went
[1:45:36] to the rocker brother band were standing
[1:45:38] on ice and I got the picture somewhere
[1:45:40] the Prophet and his son Joseph and and
[1:45:43] and the light and the pillar fire was
[1:45:45] over them and over the rock and I could
[1:45:48] turn around from the rock and look
[1:45:49] across the valley and there was the
[1:45:51] where the angels came down a man so
[1:45:54] that's why that's why God had created by
[1:45:56] grace through faith that he had created
[1:45:59] in the power that hunger and that thirst
[1:46:01] to go west
[1:46:03] amen and when but again it was to meet
[1:46:06] the angels there was the meet our Lord
[1:46:07] Jesus Christ and so on and he got the
[1:46:10] instructions now he's to go back east
[1:46:12] he said for the opening of the seven
[1:46:15] seals a Mayan city as their brothers
[1:46:18] sister all things are in order when it
[1:46:20] comes to the plan of God and the purpose
[1:46:23] of God and a pattern of God God knows
[1:46:25] what he's doing
[1:46:26] amen and I have preached on it maybe
[1:46:29] three three or four times lonesome oh so
[1:46:32] lonesome and I remember when I the first
[1:46:34] of my priests haunted outside this
[1:46:36] assembly the brother came into the
[1:46:38] office where I was always - what's the
[1:46:40] title of your message and that you're
[1:46:42] going to preach on I said lonesome oh so
[1:46:44] lonesome and it shocked him and he said
[1:46:47] what how do you spell that
[1:46:50] and I said well I said do you smell it
[1:46:53] this way and he said no soon yeah
[1:46:58] I said lonesome oh so lonesome and I
[1:47:00] said I said you'll know you'll know what
[1:47:02] it means I said when I get out there and
[1:47:04] by the grace of God I Minister the Word
[1:47:06] of God amen
[1:47:07] okay he said so he just took it I and I
[1:47:11] had to tell him how to write it down on
[1:47:12] paper and I went on and ministered on it
[1:47:15] I said and again I say he was voting
[1:47:17] some also lonesome for the faraway so
[1:47:19] where's I said because there was garbage
[1:47:21] going to medium and the angels were
[1:47:23] going to come down he was going to get
[1:47:25] the instructions that he needed knowing
[1:47:27] that he had other things to do over
[1:47:28] there as well and I won't get into that
[1:47:30] but yeah and then I said he was
[1:47:33] instructed to go back for the old me of
[1:47:35] the word amen see what God does and how
[1:47:38] God does it what in the way to God send
[1:47:40] the Angels down down there somewhere in
[1:47:42] jeffersonville no no no it was to bring
[1:47:45] out other spirits and so on that was in
[1:47:48] the people to test the faith of the
[1:47:50] prophet and and to bring out the faith
[1:47:53] of the people because when the prophet
[1:47:55] of God as I said moved to Tucson in 1962
[1:47:59] there were a lot of believers that also
[1:48:00] moved out a man and they felt because
[1:48:04] they felt that that's where the the New
[1:48:06] Jerusalem was going to come down over
[1:48:08] there and others felt the New Jerusalem
[1:48:10] was going to come down in the in the
[1:48:11] Jeffersonville area and it was no no
[1:48:14] their brothers did not err it's going to
[1:48:16] be in Israel
[1:48:17] it's going to be the New Jerusalem by
[1:48:20] the grace of God so this is this is
[1:48:22] God's plan and God's purpose and God's
[1:48:24] pattern and he did it in the private
[1:48:26] obedient and then living there for a
[1:48:29] short time then he moved back for the
[1:48:31] old me of the word amen
[1:48:33] and of course then we built we know that
[1:48:36] he built a house in Tucson and I've been
[1:48:38] in the house I've been in his den and so
[1:48:41] on and yet he never lived in that house
[1:48:44] because he was building it for his
[1:48:46] family he knew that he was going because
[1:48:50] they say and when when a.m. and another
[1:48:52] brother walked up to where they were
[1:48:54] building the house and they went up and
[1:48:56] they turned in and walked up the hill a
[1:48:58] little bit and there was this old cart
[1:49:00] or something there in the driveway or on
[1:49:03] the side of the driveway and it belonged
[1:49:06] to somebody that lived there a number of
[1:49:08] years before lived in that area and the
[1:49:11] public God said you see this he said
[1:49:12] brother yeah and he said that's that's a
[1:49:15] sign of someone he said who has finished
[1:49:18] their their their job finish their there
[1:49:21] whatever was predestinated for them
[1:49:23] finish their lives and he said they were
[1:49:25] they didn't need it anymore they left it
[1:49:27] there
[1:49:27] a million and that was a sign of why he
[1:49:30] was building that ounce amen
[1:49:33] because why it wasn't for him it was for
[1:49:37] his wife and family
[1:49:38] amen because God was going to call him
[1:49:41] home amen
[1:49:42] so brother sister God has got a plan and
[1:49:45] a purpose and a pattern when it comes to
[1:49:47] the truth of creation and what and what
[1:49:50] he has done and what he is doing and the
[1:49:51] and the heavens and the earth and the
[1:49:53] universe amen
[1:49:55] but he's got a plan and a purpose and a
[1:49:56] patter for your life a million were born
[1:50:01] in sin saved in iniquity come to the
[1:50:03] words Reagan lines and we're going to do
[1:50:05] what we want to do but then we'll begin
[1:50:07] to when we repent and were baptized in
[1:50:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:50:11] God responding to our faith gives us the
[1:50:14] Holy Ghost we're new creatures in Christ
[1:50:16] amen
[1:50:17] so it's not our natural birth control
[1:50:19] ears anymore it is our spiritual birth
[1:50:22] amen
[1:50:23] we're not going but what we feel and
[1:50:25] what we think and what we sense now
[1:50:27] we're going by faith it is the grace of
[1:50:29] God giving us the
[1:50:31] faith that I need and the revelation
[1:50:33] that I need to do this to do this go
[1:50:34] here go there ain't 9 you're a man
[1:50:37] that's not what you what you want to do
[1:50:39] is what God wants you to do oh my oh my
[1:50:42] oh my help us lord I pray because over
[1:50:45] the years I have seen so many believers
[1:50:48] they're doing what they want to do I'm a
[1:50:50] believer and I can do this and I can do
[1:50:54] that brother if you're a believer you
[1:50:56] got to die to yourself and you go become
[1:50:58] alive and sensitive to the body of
[1:51:00] Christ and the brothers and sisters are
[1:51:03] like precious thing and we have just
[1:51:05] read here in the book in Romans chapter
[1:51:06] 12 amen
[1:51:08] this is a God requires this of us amen
[1:51:12] and it is the grace of God that anointed
[1:51:15] the ball to write what he wrote to the
[1:51:17] Romans
[1:51:18] amen and then we know the Romans were
[1:51:21] the Gentiles they say that's definitely
[1:51:24] you and me by the grace of Almighty God
[1:51:27] through His grace in the ministry of
[1:51:30] Paul to give us this revelation of the
[1:51:33] will of God for everyday living as sons
[1:51:36] and daughters of God and as Christians a
[1:51:38] night as relievers by the grace of God
[1:51:41] amen whether we are Christians and God
[1:51:46] is in control and if there's anything
[1:51:49] that we're going to manifest and
[1:51:51] anything that we're going to bear
[1:51:52] witness of is the grace of God amen amen
[1:51:55] amen
[1:51:57] yeah brother if there's anything that we
[1:51:59] ought to highlight in the message in the
[1:52:01] Word of God anything I God is going to
[1:52:02] highlight it is Grace
[1:52:04] it is unmerited favor amen brother so it
[1:52:08] was in the mind of God before the
[1:52:10] foundation of the world before he
[1:52:11] created the heaven and the earth
[1:52:13] there was grace he knew that he knew
[1:52:15] what was going to happen when he do this

[1:52:19] did that
[1:52:19] amen so brother and he also knew they
[1:52:23] brothers sister whatever what was going
[1:52:25] to heaven he knew that those that his
[1:52:27] creation was going to need grace amen
[1:52:31] he knew that they're going to render
[1:52:34] good that Adam and Eve was going to need
[1:52:35] the grace of God and that they would
[1:52:38] need to show grace to the to the to the
[1:52:40] heaven and the earth
[1:52:41] amen because of the way they give the
[1:52:44] was going to treat everything on the
[1:52:46] evident the earth Satan is the god of
[1:52:48] this world and brother through there
[1:52:51] when it comes to oh the cousin are we
[1:52:54] talking to our brother David here
[1:52:56] concerning what God has done what God
[1:52:58] has done yeah and the devil is perverted
[1:53:00] at all and brother is not in any and
[1:53:03] it's just not the human body and the
[1:53:05] fleshly but the devil is perverted all
[1:53:07] creation the devil is perverted the
[1:53:09] trees and the plants and all of that
[1:53:11] amen and the earth that's why God is
[1:53:14] going to show the earth and of the son
[1:53:16] and his Cheyenne is going to burn from

[1:53:20] going to be any any any indication of
[1:53:24] sin left on the earth amen it's going to
[1:53:27] be burnt from the inside out and he said
[1:53:30] God creates the new heaven and a new
[1:53:32] earth as you and I are born again the
[1:53:34] prophet of God said the new he said the
[1:53:36] new heaven and the new earth it's it's
[1:53:37] new creation

[1:53:46] were in the beginning a man perfect
[1:53:49] brother again it is all grease grease
[1:53:53] grease when we consider what man has
[1:53:55] done from Genesis when we consider what
[1:53:58] man has done right on through down to
[1:54:00] even to the end of the book of
[1:54:01] Revelation amen it is the grace of God
[1:54:04] amen God saw it
[1:54:06] God knew it he knew this he knew this he
[1:54:09] knew that but he praise His grace which
[1:54:12] was there to project the faith that
[1:54:14] would change it
[1:54:16] His grace was interpreting the faith
[1:54:19] that would change you and me God Elvis
[1:54:22] rather to be spiritually minded God
[1:54:25] Elvis to be controlled by the Holy Ghost
[1:54:28] so again it's crazy the NS may the Holy
[1:54:32] Ghost ain't know this tremendous Jesus

[1:54:58] eternity amen
[1:55:00] that's where we come from ain't man then
[1:55:03] the enemy got us trapped into these into
[1:55:05] these bodies but Jesus has set forth
[1:55:08] Alleluia
[1:55:08] the grace of God has said for the faith
[1:55:10] to get us out of these bodies and to get
[1:55:13] us out of time and back to eternity amen
[1:55:16] by the grace of God amen we know that
[1:55:19] and that's the seed of God not serpent
[1:55:21] seed by the seed of God there was Cain
[1:55:24] he was serpent seed and there's the seed
[1:55:26] of God amen
[1:55:28] and as I said both of them - both of
[1:55:29] them offered sacrifice to the Lord
[1:55:31] both them were worshiping God a man but
[1:55:34] they would not but Cain would not do the
[1:55:37] will of God a man he refused the faith
[1:55:39] of God but that was grace you died the
[1:55:42] grace that's Grace and God came down to
[1:55:45] the cane and he asked came this he
[1:55:48] talked the cane it's hard to cane it was
[1:55:50] grace that got that told Cain if you do
[1:55:52] right once you also be accepted that was
[1:55:55] great but he knew he wasn't gonna do
[1:55:57] right everybody so that's where as what
[1:56:00] Cain left there and he went on up
[1:56:02] through to earth through a certain area
[1:56:04] there and they started their own church
[1:56:06] everything a man that's right and in
[1:56:09] that area it is said that when that when
[1:56:12] they when Noah came the grace of God
[1:56:14] ministry through Noah about the flood
[1:56:17] that says that they built a high tower
[1:56:19] they built it and built and built it
[1:56:21] because they felt they would expect the
[1:56:24] flood but it was serpent seed but they
[1:56:27] didn't escape it amen
[1:56:29] because they all gave themselves over to
[1:56:31] the devil amen
[1:56:33] he was the god of the world for them
[1:56:35] because Cain had refused the God that
[1:56:38] evil was worshiping he refused the
[1:56:41] revelation of God and to do what God
[1:56:43] wanted them to do they offer the the
[1:56:45] more excellent sacrifice he offered an
[1:56:48] excellent one and you got a serpent see
[1:56:51] today they're offering excellent
[1:56:52] sacrifices but not the more excellent
[1:56:55] Harry Marion but they they're they'll do
[1:56:59] take this and take that but God wants
[1:57:02] this Plus
[1:57:03] Plus this Plus this amen God reveals
[1:57:06] this this this and this amen
[1:57:08] because he's bringing us to more and
[1:57:10] more and more perfection a man but Cain
[1:57:13] Cain and his seed or they feel that all
[1:57:16] I got to do is I had a simple this and a
[1:57:18] similar bad faith you know and it's in
[1:57:19] their heads and in their flesh and maybe
[1:57:21] in their human spirit but they turned
[1:57:24] down this word they turned down that
[1:57:25] word in Luther's day well Thursday the
[1:57:27] Pentecostal age and in this age more and
[1:57:29] more turns on the word so that if you
[1:57:32] don't shorten time to be no flesh safe
[1:57:34] that's how serious it is well assistant
[1:57:37] if it's that serious that revelation on
[1:57:41] a makeup serious even if is that serious
[1:57:45] that revelation other drivers more and
[1:57:47] more simply humble ourselves to the
[1:57:49] grace of God nor do we need your
[1:57:51] unmerited favor Oh on their two favorite
[1:57:54] we need we don't deserve it Lord so it's
[1:57:57] Grace anybody
[1:57:58] it's your grace Lord your nature we need
[1:58:02] this we need this we need you anybody
[1:58:04] every step of the way lord grace
[1:58:07] brothers sister I mean even stopped to
[1:58:10] consider grace not I know and I don't
[1:58:12] mean intellectually but spiritually how
[1:58:16] many are experiencing Grace in their
[1:58:18] hearts and in their souls amen how many
[1:58:21] are aware that what I am I am by the
[1:58:24] grace of God
[1:58:25] oh it's Jesus yes but it's grace giving
[1:58:27] you the revelation it's great it's
[1:58:29] calling you to receive Jesus as your
[1:58:31] Lord and Savior that's grace amen
[1:58:34] all the father give me will come to me
[1:58:37] Jesus say all the father has given me
[1:58:41] will come to me
[1:58:42] and I will lose none of them well who's
[1:58:46] the father going to give him did the
[1:58:51] father give you the Jesus there's a lot
[1:58:54] of there that the father not given the
[1:58:56] Jesus if he said that there has to be
[1:59:00] many of there that are not saved yeah
[1:59:06] servants heat they are serpents eat
[1:59:09] religious some of them are but still
[1:59:11] serpents eat amen all the father give me
[1:59:15] will come to me
[1:59:16] and I will lose none of them very bad so
[1:59:20] the father didn't give him all to Jesus
[1:59:21] the father's given those in me for new
[1:59:24] that would have the seat of God in their
[1:59:27] hearts and in their souls a man and God
[1:59:31] would God would water that seed with his
[1:59:33] word and it would break a man and that
[1:59:35] she would break and would go up to
[1:59:38] produce the word the word the word
[1:59:39] Christ in a stove of glory hey man where
[1:59:42] others are going to take it into their
[1:59:44] heads because there's no seed in their
[1:59:45] heart see God knew God is God God knows
[1:59:50] all things he is omnipotent he
[1:59:52] all-knowing all-powerful and he
[1:59:53] omniscient all-knowing very bad so he
[1:59:57] knew who would be here today
[1:59:59] and he knows what's in your heart now

[2:00:08] thoughts in control or your heart is

[2:00:30] gonna do this I'm gonna do that amen
[2:00:35] it's the leadership of God he's in
[2:00:37] control

[2:00:42] brother used to go here he had training
[2:00:45] in the college whatever for a certain
[2:00:49] job and I said he was he was saying old

[2:01:16] this if it's him only a janitor he'll
[2:01:18] bless you
[2:01:19] you'll meet your needs but people don't

[2:01:23] believe in God people really don't trust
[2:01:25] him you know that that that if I do this
[2:01:29] God's going to bless
[2:01:30] if I do that God's got a blessing oh no

[2:01:36] you to do grace of God God Elvis what
[2:01:46] help us have that spirit he's turned the
[2:01:51] hearts of the children back to the

[2:02:12] come to the message oh yeah and they
[2:02:18] sold all they had extra and give to the
[2:02:21] poor what yeah
[2:02:29] because why they weren't living for

[2:02:39] they give to the poor give to this one
[2:02:40] that that need that one twenty they
[2:02:42] meant by the grace of God brother what
[2:02:48] is the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's
[2:02:51] the life of Christ in you hey man as
[2:02:56] Jesus said he's they got nowhere to lay
[2:02:58] my head we don't want to not many
[2:03:01] believers want to say that no Lord we
[2:03:04] don't do that
[2:03:05] amen if you're willing to do it you'll
[2:03:07] provide hey man brother amen god help us

[2:03:15] unmerited favor of God toward us
[2:03:17] God knows their attitudes God knows our
[2:03:19] spirits God knows what we feel we want
[2:03:22] in our flesh and so on and sometimes
[2:03:25] gotta put the test on you yeah just to
[2:03:30] see if you would do it of course that
[2:03:32] brother that told to go to the City
[2:03:34] Council I said it might need some of the
[2:03:36] drive drive there garbage truck and now
[2:03:39] so they left no they left maybe they
[2:03:47] should have stayed because their life
[2:03:53] that sort of blowing blowing apart still
[2:04:00] go to one of them still goes to church
[2:04:01] but but is it the will of God see people
[2:04:08] don't stop to consider in all thy ways
[2:04:12] acknowledge him and he will direct thy
[2:04:16] paths
[2:04:17] amen grace of God brother listen grace
[2:04:27] let me reference this
[2:04:34] hard to believe grace is first mentioned
[2:04:40] in Genesis six and eight that Noah found
[2:04:42] grace in the eyes of the Lord and Noah
[2:04:46] and again grace his last mentioned as I
[2:04:49] mentioned Dutton to thy service
[2:04:50] mentioned in Revelation the last chapter
[2:04:54] of Revelation and it's tremendous it
[2:04:58] begins by grace
[2:05:00] it ends with grace in revelation 22
[2:05:03] where any said the grace of our Lord
[2:05:06] Jesus Christ be with you all amen
[2:05:08] a man it was Grace in the Garden of Eden
[2:05:13] it was grace down through the ages and
[2:05:15] now Grace in the end a man John crying
[2:05:19] grace grace for the elect of God a man
[2:05:23] those that would take their stand for
[2:05:26] the gospel for the truth all the way
[2:05:27] down through the church ages all the way
[2:05:29] down through the ages and when he
[2:05:31] finished it he said grace brother we
[2:05:34] need a grace in the beginning we need
[2:05:36] grace in the end we acknowledge the
[2:05:39] grace of God in the beginning we
[2:05:40] acknowledge the grace of God in the end
[2:05:42] we acknowledge that it is Grace that
[2:05:44] come from eternity to help us and grace
[2:05:48] is going to take us back to eternity
[2:05:50] amen
[2:05:52] brother how can they deny this okay how
[2:05:59] can they lay it aside I kind of just
[2:06:04] just lay it aside and let it become
[2:06:05] dusting in in their homes if they got
[2:06:11] him yeah there's like the I told you
[2:06:14] about the the youngster to winning to
[2:06:15] Grandma and Grandpa's house and found
[2:06:17] the Bible there and they found the
[2:06:18] pictures here and this one and this and
[2:06:20] dad or do you say what's just a
[2:06:22] scrapbook for the childhood scrapbook
[2:06:26] why because there was dust on the bible
[2:06:29] and in the bible there was all kinds of
[2:06:31] natural things papers notes not bible
[2:06:36] notes oh yeah and the child thought it
[2:06:40] was obscure there was that much stuck in
[2:06:43] the Bible
[2:06:45] brother there's one brother said to me
[2:06:52] that's not Greece
[2:06:54] I pray grace to him one time and he said
[2:06:59] oh we said I don't need to read my Bible
[2:07:01] I said why now he said I don't mean I
[2:07:06] don't need he said to read a message
[2:07:08] book he said I said why well he said I
[2:07:11] got a pastor and he said he's reading
[2:07:13] the Bible and easy he's doing the
[2:07:14] messages and so on I said yeah I said at
[2:07:18] the mouth of two or three witnesses let
[2:07:20] it be established so I should read you
[2:07:22] read the Bible to make sure it's us
[2:07:24] today at the Lord read the bottom my
[2:07:26] shorts it is written that's right yeah
[2:07:30] and a believer and a professing believer
[2:07:32] told me that Co insane that the world's
[2:07:36] getting oh yeah and again I guess I said
[2:07:41] there are those that feel that all I got
[2:07:43] to do is read a book or all I gotta do
[2:07:44] is listen to a tape and but again your
[2:07:47] pastors are Dana need you through the
[2:07:48] prophecy and he said you you'll live no
[2:07:51] higher than your pastor that's the truth
[2:07:55] and when it comes out I said it made me
[2:07:58] number times long time ago I said there
[2:08:00] are a lot of the Labor's that now
[2:08:03] there's not many like it even the even
[2:08:06] like this I said you know I said some
[2:08:09] believers you know when it comes to
[2:08:10] reading the message book they should
[2:08:12] start
[2:08:12] they just started at the last few pages
[2:08:14] per line because I that's all they're
[2:08:18] interested in I said it's the signs and
[2:08:21] wonders as all they're interested in is
[2:08:24] physical healing God meeting this
[2:08:26] physical need that physical need so I
[2:08:29] said that's where they should and I said
[2:08:31] and the same thing as they used to read
[2:08:33] the Bible and they skip or skip that
[2:08:35] verse yeah and they skip that chapter or
[2:08:38] that book whatever and the message oh
[2:08:42] just skip that paragraph
[2:08:45] yeah yeah just skip that page yeah
[2:08:50] things the Prophet is said about this
[2:08:51] things the Prophet said about that
[2:08:53] they want
[2:08:59] where is the grace of God in their lives
[2:09:01] to line up with the word and again I
[2:09:07] know that's why a number of people that
[2:09:09] wouldn't have brother Joe breach no way
[2:09:13] they said because there's something that
[2:09:16] I am a remark I made years ago I was it
[2:09:20] what it was and but actually the notes
[2:09:23] that I read that I thought I quoted the
[2:09:25] quotes that I quoted was that I received
[2:09:28] it from sister Fulcher and she's gone to
[2:09:31] hit the Lord now I received from her
[2:09:33] years ago because she agreed with what I
[2:09:36] was saying she this weather prophet said
[2:09:39] Amen she that's the truth and and I said
[2:09:44] it years ago when we're any Empire
[2:09:47] Avenue Church and then not long ago I
[2:09:51] received an email not very danke home
[2:09:55] and they said oh I hear you preach this
[2:09:58] and you preach that someone told me I
[2:10:02] said why after all these years they come
[2:10:07] back to condemn me for preaching that
[2:10:11] yeah amazing
[2:10:14] yeah and that uh I said Lord I said have
[2:10:18] mercy on help the grace of God amen
[2:10:24] brother
[2:10:24] god help us to have the revelation of
[2:10:27] grace and that humbles us in the
[2:10:29] presence of God it almost to the Word of
[2:10:31] God a man Lord it's your word that's the
[2:10:36] most important thing now is your word
[2:10:38] Lord am I in line with your word father
[2:10:41] am i making my calling and election sure
[2:10:43] by looking into the mirror of the word
[2:10:45] oh I need to wash my face I didn't do
[2:10:50] this I need to do that you know okay
[2:10:52] Lord yeah I need line up help me but
[2:10:56] again too many as they look into the
[2:10:58] mirror the word turn around go and they
[2:11:00] forget what they looked at and there's a
[2:11:01] lot of people rather they can come in
[2:11:03] and me listen to a sermon and preach and
[2:11:05] and service and everything forget
[2:11:07] everything
[2:11:08] boy they did whereas others ago the
[2:11:11] can't get it out of the heart did you
[2:11:14] get it in your head you brush it aside
[2:11:16] but if you get it in your heart can't
[2:11:18] get it away from can't get away from her
[2:11:21] brother so the grace of God Genesis Noah
[2:11:28] found grace in the eyes of the Lord
[2:11:31] hey man Noah and yet he walked with God
[2:11:35] but he found grace in the eyes of the
[2:11:38] Lord now that's why Enoch walked with
[2:11:40] God and he found Grace and he was
[2:11:42] raptured a man and again in Revelation
[2:11:46] which says the grace of our Lord Jesus
[2:11:48] Christ be with you all as fish amazing
[2:11:51] that's what asked the way God finished
[2:11:53] it amen he began with grace and he ended
[2:11:56] with Grace's better if there's anything
[2:11:59] God don't want us to forget his grace in
[2:12:02] learning that will humble us is the
[2:12:04] revelation of the grace of God amen
[2:12:07] brother amen
[2:12:08] all of us could we recognize that all
[2:12:11] that God has done and is doing for me
[2:12:13] and what I add by the grace of God oh
[2:12:15] Lord oh Lord oh Lord is grace grace
[2:12:17] thank you Jesus I'm not working but you
[2:12:21] did it thank you
[2:12:22] consider what Jesus did for you consider
[2:12:28] what Jesus suffered for you consider the
[2:12:31] pain and the agony and the sorrow that
[2:12:34] he endured for your salvation for the
[2:12:38] elects a brother then you want to die
[2:12:44] for him
[2:12:49] grace
[2:12:52] the Bible mentions the word grace 159
[2:12:59] times amen in the messages of the
[2:13:05] Prophet listen from one 1947 to 1965 he
[2:13:12] referenced grace the grace of God three
[2:13:15] thousand four hundred and seventeen
[2:13:18] times amen
[2:13:25] from 1960 alone to 1965 as he got in did
[2:13:30] begin to get into the opening of the
[2:13:32] word concerning the Jews concerning the
[2:13:34] church ages not into the seals and the
[2:13:36] mystery of God the rapture oh yes there
[2:13:40] was a lot of emphasis on the rapture
[2:13:42] sixty to sixty-five by the grace of God
[2:13:47] and he emphasized grace from 1960 to
[2:13:50] sixty-five he touched on grace he
[2:13:52] emphasized grace amen
[2:13:54] one thousand six hundred and eight times
[2:13:59] sixteen hundred and eight times he
[2:14:02] mentioned grace the grace of God a man
[2:14:08] by grace through faith we are saved and
[2:14:12] concerning faith it is in the Bible 231
[2:14:17] times amen
[2:14:21] the Prophet made reference to it from
[2:14:24] 1947 to 1965 twelve thousand nine
[2:14:29] hundred and fifty four times he
[2:14:31] mentioned faith faith old brother and
[2:14:39] from 1960 to sixty-five he mentioned
[2:14:42] faith he highlighted faith five thousand
[2:14:46] and fifty six times almost at the time
[2:14:52] that he mentioned it in his entire
[2:14:53] ministry amen
[2:14:58] he put the emphasis on grace grace grace
[2:15:01] lord help us because it is by grace
[2:15:05] through faith that we are saved bear
[2:15:09] with me
[2:15:12] didn't realize that was this long but
[2:15:17] again 20 minutes of anointed preaching
[2:15:22] there's like eight hours of hard but I
[2:15:27] call it the sledgehammer work how many
[2:15:35] hours have I spent with the sledgehammer
[2:15:38] amen
[2:15:39] with the word by the grace of Almighty
[2:15:43] God amen just for share with you a
[2:15:47] couple of scriptures we know that the
[2:15:50] Ephesians one is similar to by grace are
[2:15:52] you saved through faith and that's not
[2:15:55] of yourself it's the gift of God and if
[2:16:00] God gave us such a gift to get us out of
[2:16:03] time take us away from hell
[2:16:06] get us into the kingdom of God how much
[2:16:10] ought we to show to appreciate it and
[2:16:12] love you all my brother sister people
[2:16:17] people do less for one another and
[2:16:19] they're and they're loved and must do we
[2:16:24] love God oh that one did this for me
[2:16:26] that one did that for me oh I love them
[2:16:28] I would loving God God did more for us
[2:16:34] than anyone could ever do that's right
[2:16:39] so it is by grace through faith were
[2:16:41] saved not of yourselves it is the gift
[2:16:43] of God and we've been created in christ
[2:16:45] jesus on to good works
[2:16:48] amen so his grasing active in your life
[2:16:53] not so saving you but as let your
[2:16:57] actions speak louder than your words
[2:17:00] amen and he said also said in the word
[2:17:11] be there for followers of God as dear
[2:17:14] children and walk in love as Christ also
[2:17:20] had loved us and has given himself an
[2:17:24] offering and a sacrifice to God for a
[2:17:27] sweet-smelling savour but he said
[2:17:31] fornication and all uncleanness or
[2:17:33] covetousness let it not be once named
[2:17:37] among you as becometh Saints neither
[2:17:40] filthiness nor foolish talking nor
[2:17:44] jesting now God got nothing against a
[2:17:48] little bit of humor prophecy even God
[2:17:50] had humor yeah but not we don't give
[2:17:57] ourselves over to the foolish jesting
[2:17:58] and and and foolish talking of the world
[2:18:02] no so nor foolish talking and nor
[2:18:07] jesting which are not convenient but
[2:18:10] rather giving of thanks for this she
[2:18:13] know that no whoremonger nor unclean
[2:18:14] person nor covetous man who is an
[2:18:18] idolater has any inheritance in the
[2:18:22] kingdom of God out of Christ and of God
[2:18:26] let no man deceive you with vain words
[2:18:31] they men for because of these things
[2:18:34] cometh the wrath of God upon the
[2:18:37] children of disobedience again is not
[2:18:40] what you did it's what you didn't do and
[2:18:46] a lot of believers are guilty not of
[2:18:50] doing this doing this is what they
[2:18:52] didn't do amen
[2:18:56] be be not ye therefore partakers with
[2:19:00] them for ye were sometimes darkness but
[2:19:04] now are ye light in the Lord walk as
[2:19:08] children of light for the fruit of the
[2:19:12] Spirit is in all goodness and
[2:19:15] righteousness and truth the fruit of the
[2:19:19] Spirit in your life is
[2:19:21] goodness righteousness and truth proving
[2:19:26] what is acceptable under the Lord and
[2:19:28] have no fellowship with the unfruitful
[2:19:30] works of darkness but rather reprove
[2:19:34] them a man and a man I just read one
[2:19:41] other scripture there
[2:19:49] it says he given more grace wherefore he
[2:19:52] saith God resisteth the proud but he
[2:19:55] giveth grace unto the humble are you
[2:20:01] humble I trust by grace that the
[2:20:07] revelation that you were a sinner in
[2:20:10] need of salvation completely that umbels
[2:20:13] you to our Lord Jesus Christ and he
[2:20:16] giveth grace unto the humble you got to
[2:20:20] have a right spirit and right attitude
[2:20:22] when you come to the Lord amen
[2:20:32] in the message on the message of race he
[2:20:39] said I know there is a God I know that
[2:20:42] Jesus Christ is the son of God Emmanuel
[2:20:46] dwelling amongst his people today in the
[2:20:49] form of the Holy Spirit and I know that
[2:20:53] he the coming of the Lord is drawing
[2:20:56] nigh when signs and wonders are
[2:20:58] appearing and we just got through the
[2:21:01] seventh search ages learning that we are
[2:21:04] in the last and lauda see and search
[2:21:06] each will we're in the bright age now
[2:21:10] thank God and he said and when the
[2:21:14] church would be indifferent get cold
[2:21:16] dominate and be organized organization
[2:21:19] was at which organizations would take it
[2:21:21] over and eat it up but a promise that
[2:21:24] there would be a little remnant left
[2:21:28] there would be a church that will be
[2:21:30] scattered abroad everywhere but God
[2:21:33] would gather it together and rapture it
[2:21:35] into glory and he said the other day
[2:21:39] when I got Daniel seventy week standing
[2:21:42] right here the pulpit he said something
[2:21:44] struck me and he said I've never been
[2:21:47] able to get away from it see to see the
[2:21:49] hour that we are living in and that's
[2:21:52] the affected that I'm brother Brennan to
[2:21:54] see what he saw because he saw more than
[2:21:57] you and me as a prophet and he said
[2:22:00] there's a lot of things he knows he said
[2:22:03] it'll be in my heart he said when I go
[2:22:05] to my grave he knew he was going you
[2:22:10] know so if he saw and and it struck him
[2:22:13] and they were very serious in fact it
[2:22:15] got to the place where he said hey I
[2:22:16] think I'm losing my mind how many are
[2:22:20] going to let the word take control that
[2:22:21] much people avoid it Oh even lose your
[2:22:27] mind good
[2:22:29] we need the news that when it comes to
[2:22:31] the world and the things of the world he
[2:22:35] so that struck me and I have never been
[2:22:37] able to get away from it to see the hour
[2:22:39] that we are living in I want to go
[2:22:41] somewhere and do something else and he
[2:22:43] said I've got too many loved ones that's
[2:22:45] unseen knowing what can I do to get them
[2:22:48] saved and he said we got to plead the
[2:22:50] token for them in another message and he
[2:22:55] said and still the world is getting
[2:22:57] worse and then I have to remember that
[2:23:00] we are living in the loudest C an age
[2:23:02] where they will get worse a man it said
[2:23:05] they would get worse and then I chose
[2:23:09] this morning he said being that the
[2:23:11] message was so attacked yeah but he
[2:23:15] preached the people were attacking he
[2:23:18] said another thing that I think I am
[2:23:20] gotten after about is preaching grace
[2:23:25] because he began to realize we needed
[2:23:27] the revelation of grace and we needed
[2:23:30] more grace because of the condition of
[2:23:32] the world we needed the grace of God to
[2:23:34] help us strengthen us and encourage us
[2:23:36] amen and brother again we need the grace
[2:23:39] of God for the brothers and sisters in
[2:23:42] need the repair requests that went over
[2:23:45] the pulpit today God Elvis brother yes
[2:23:49] there's not one of us here without a
[2:23:51] need we need grace but you know
[2:23:56] testimony of grace is humility
[2:24:02] your humble God helpers and brother BAM
[2:24:09] read the scripture that I started with
[2:24:10] some time ago Zechariah and he said this
[2:24:14] is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel
[2:24:16] saying not by might nor by power but by
[2:24:19] my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts and he
[2:24:22] said the message will not come by some
[2:24:24] great mites of power but by the Spirit
[2:24:27] of God and he said to zerubabbel thou
[2:24:33] shalt become a plane and he shall bring
[2:24:36] forth the headstone there are with
[2:24:37] shoutings crying grace grace grace unto
[2:24:40] it grace grace grace unto it
[2:24:47] he said I want you to put on your
[2:24:50] spiritual thinking a man I want you to
[2:24:54] put on your anointing jacket this
[2:24:56] morning as we think and this great
[2:24:58] Prince determined he said to rebuild the
[2:25:01] house of the Lord and then he said what
[2:25:03] he did he laid the foundation stone and
[2:25:06] have you noticed he never said he shall
[2:25:09] bring forth the cornerstone he shall
[2:25:12] bring forth the headstone a man and
[2:25:17] brother the seventh church messenger was
[2:25:19] to restore the faith of the children
[2:25:21] back to the father's in other words
[2:25:23] rebuild the church again under the power
[2:25:26] of the Holy Spirit and he said it's by
[2:25:30] the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the
[2:25:32] church in the last day I trust that
[2:25:35] you're under the control of the Holy
[2:25:37] Ghost that's right the Holy Ghost
[2:25:41] controls you what you do you do by the
[2:25:44] leadership of the Holy Ghost in your
[2:25:46] heart and so the conviction of the Holy
[2:25:48] Ghost he can control you not there - you
[2:25:54] know sometimes just to do this do this
[2:25:56] yeah no no we get too far out of place
[2:26:00] and he got a stamp on us no no that he's
[2:26:04] there in control by the grace of God he
[2:26:09] said when you've done all the stand
[2:26:10] staying put on the whole armour of God
[2:26:14] amen brother Matthew mentioned in this
[2:26:18] prayer less service I think it's all in
[2:26:24] the front but not in the back the
[2:26:27] probably God warned us about attacking
[2:26:31] her brother from the back he did and he
[2:26:38] said you do that he said in the eyes of
[2:26:41] God you're guilty of murder brother I
[2:26:47] tell you grace grace keeps your attitude
[2:26:51] right your spirit right your motives
[2:26:53] your objectives all mine that's right
[2:26:57] to give brother-sister listen again
[2:27:00] that's why the angel told the Prophet be
[2:27:02] careful don't don't conduct column
[2:27:05] Rickey's Erekat us and that woman out
[2:27:08] there doing this way she's dressed well
[2:27:10] don't condemn her condemned that thing
[2:27:12] but pray the grace of God to her okay
[2:27:15] there was you but for the grace of God
[2:27:18] amen praise the Lord
[2:27:22] it's like the woman's Jesus met at the
[2:27:24] well everybody condemned her that's
[2:27:29] right but Jesus went and brought it what
[2:27:33] was in her most would bring out the
[2:27:36] natural thing that was in her but Jesus
[2:27:38] knew there was a spiritual seed in there
[2:27:41] she right away when when he testified to
[2:27:45] her by the word she recognized it oh
[2:27:50] you're the Christ you're the Messiah and
[2:27:52] then she took off into the city and
[2:27:54] began to witness to everybody she ran
[2:27:56] around and around and around
[2:27:58] whoa Messiah he's over here so finally
[2:28:04] they said well we don't believe you now
[2:28:05] we believe can be seen it ourselves and
[2:28:08] really where were they on the day he was
[2:28:12] crucified a lot of those people that
[2:28:15] were when he came in on the on the
[2:28:17] donkey and they all screaming and oh
[2:28:19] praise the Lord hallelujah King of Kings
[2:28:22] and so on all that none David rebuked
[2:28:24] him and he said they older piece the
[2:28:26] rocks are crammed yeah where were they
[2:28:29] when he was crucified
[2:28:39] brother where are they now where's the
[2:28:41] seed of God now in this hour when God is
[2:28:43] looking for the bride that is one with
[2:28:46] him one with his word listen I can't
[2:28:54] read it all grace of God he's now
[2:29:02] according to the prophecy there will
[2:29:04] come the headstone and he has come and I
[2:29:07] want you to notice that when the
[2:29:09] headstone comes the Prince that's going
[2:29:12] to carry out of the message will cry
[2:29:14] grace grace anything we're gonna cry as
[2:29:17] grace there's grace that's bringing us
[2:29:21] to where we are giving us what we have
[2:29:23] when it comes to the revelation of the
[2:29:25] word grace is going to keep emphasizing
[2:29:28] resurrection rapture grace kept
[2:29:31] emphasizing justification for Luther
[2:29:34] sanctification for Wesley baptism of the
[2:29:38] Holy Ghost gifts of the spiritual
[2:29:40] Pentecostals now the Spirit is going to
[2:29:44] continue the grace of God's going to
[2:29:46] magnify in the grace of God to us yeah
[2:29:50] it's great now why the grace of our Lord
[2:29:54] Jesus Christ be with you all because
[2:29:56] after all is said and done come to an
[2:29:58] end
[2:29:58] we need grace to get to go from time to
[2:30:02] eternity he said we're good the Prince
[2:30:06] that's going to cry out the message will
[2:30:08] cry grace grace for it's by grace are we
[2:30:12] saved not a works lest any man should
[2:30:15] boast and the message of grace has been
[2:30:18] tramped under feet to min until it's
[2:30:20] become a disgrace
[2:30:22] some of them runs out into it eternal
[2:30:25] security some runs into everything but
[2:30:28] the true message of grace remains the
[2:30:30] same we are sinners saved by grace it's
[2:30:34] simple and it's humble amen so in the
[2:30:40] deity of Jesus Christ the Lord Cain
[2:30:42] could come there and confirm that this
[2:30:44] is the truth we are saved by grace
[2:30:47] through faith not by works work shows
[2:30:50] that you have been saying
[2:30:51] but what saves you is the grace of God
[2:30:54] work shows that you have been saved
[2:30:57] well what saves you as the grace of God
[2:30:59] grace saves you grace is what God does
[2:31:02] for you grace is what you do for God to
[2:31:05] show appreciation of what God did for
[2:31:07] you
[2:31:08] amen and he says some people think I
[2:31:12] joined the church you believe this you
[2:31:14] believe that it's grace he said I am
[2:31:18] nothing to love come see him which is
[2:31:20] Grace and he says you can do all these
[2:31:24] things and still be lost and he says
[2:31:27] it's grace that saves you God's grace to
[2:31:29] the human race amen
[2:31:38] well one finished the quotes I'll just
[2:31:41] give you another quote or two Father God
[2:31:49] said it I thought of the grace of God
[2:31:53] and how he could do that to save to the
[2:31:57] uttermost and to give me grace I thought
[2:32:01] oh it's amazing grace and then come to
[2:32:03] me degraded no squirrel hunter out into
[2:32:07] the woods and he said from himself in
[2:32:09] the form of the rainbow he said which
[2:32:13] means the Covenant with a message that
[2:32:15] he gave me to preach and form it there
[2:32:19] in a covenant that he's behind it and
[2:32:21] he'll be behind it because the messages
[2:32:24] of Jesus Christ and His glory it's the
[2:32:29] Spirit of God that confirms the word and
[2:32:32] he said listen he said the simplicity is
[2:32:38] believing God amen and he said it takes
[2:32:43] a humble heart dedicated to God to bring
[2:32:46] Jesus Christ into the present tense and
[2:32:51] he said amen if it taken theology what
[2:32:56] would the Presbyterian methodist Baptist
[2:32:58] Catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a
[2:33:01] chance
[2:33:01] us poor unlearned people but it doesn't
[2:33:03] take knowledge
[2:33:05] not by power not nor by might but only
[2:33:08] by my spirit sent the Lord he said I'll
[2:33:11] unfold this mystery and he'll cry to it
[2:33:14] grace grace with shoutings and crimes he
[2:33:19] said that's what it is today
[2:33:21] it is God's Amazing Grace to his people
[2:33:24] how he takes the illiterate he takes the
[2:33:28] unlearn that shows that Jesus is the
[2:33:31] same and he's crying grace grace grace
[2:33:35] the message of old is Grace brother
[2:33:43] sister were here because of grace please
[2:33:46] humble ourselves as sons and daughters
[2:33:50] of God and that will mature as sons and
[2:33:54] daughters of God he said grace his old
[2:34:00] Grace's as old as the world is grace was
[2:34:04] first shown to the human race when he
[2:34:07] had a beginning of the human race that's
[2:34:10] right when the human race was first
[2:34:13] created in the Garden of Eden on that
[2:34:15] dark morning when that little woman that
[2:34:17] stepped across the separating line and
[2:34:19] had gone against God's commandments
[2:34:21] enticed her husband to do the same the
[2:34:24] law must have a penalty or it's no law
[2:34:26] and the law was the day you eat thereof
[2:34:28] the day you surely die remember the
[2:34:31] first judgement seat was upon the earth
[2:34:33] and it was in the Garden of Eden and the
[2:34:36] last judgement seat will be upon the
[2:34:38] earth at the end time it's the white
[2:34:41] throne and brother this is an hour of
[2:34:44] judgment that we're living in it is we
[2:34:51] could preach the message I could talk on
[2:34:53] the message again on the indictment he's
[2:34:58] I indict this man this this world he
[2:35:00] indicted the world he indicted the
[2:35:02] churches he indicted individuals for the
[2:35:05] crucifixion of the word not today there
[2:35:07] are believers who have crucified the
[2:35:08] word and his believers today who are
[2:35:11] crucifying the way

[2:35:16] controlled their lives that were that
[2:35:18] part that part that part oh I just
[2:35:20] believed this doctrine this doctrine is

[2:52:36] amen
[2:52:37] praise the Lord amen you bring up that
[2:52:41] one I'm no longer a slave to fear but a
[2:52:45] general hit it on the head the other
[2:52:46] night Wednesday night when he said this
[2:52:50] world is subject to fear and you know I
[2:52:58] think he referred to the fact of many
[2:53:00] believers are and that's a tool of the
[2:53:02] devil
[2:53:03] if he can put fear in our hearts then
[2:53:06] then that's diametrically opposed to
[2:53:08] faith all right so he's undermining our
[2:53:10] faith by doing that so if you look at
[2:53:14] and put up the chorus first brother and
[2:53:16] then we're going to reverses after that
[2:53:19] but this is what we can say to the devil
[2:53:22] this is a boo devil song this one here
[2:53:24] it says I know you know devil you know
[2:53:26] you throw this at me but I'm no longer a
[2:53:28] slave to fear you know so this just
[2:53:31] weapon of yours is ineffective I'm a
[2:53:34] child of God
[2:53:35] that's why Amen let's just sing the
[2:53:39] chorus
