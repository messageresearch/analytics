don't know if anybody i saw the song before and i kind of told the background of it and and i don't like i don't know how how much people know about daddy ramble but she had a really rough life like a really rough life um i think she was converted at 12 and she was just in country music and i think she helped bring money into the family and when she when she got saved and she began to sing just gospel music her father put her out and she was put out of the house at 12 years old and at 17 i think she got married and that man wasn't faithful to her but she stayed married to him so long as far as i know she had a lot of sickness in her life and i think you know um she make really queer things um that you wouldn't talk about really here but like clear things like in her travels like with ministry and stuff she found strange things and then she finally died i think and her bus crashed i think it's funny how she died right but all of it drove her to god and and she's almost kind of like the fanny crosby of today of the 20th century anyway so i give all that to say that she wrote this song and she wasn't talking out of her head the only other thing i want to add to this is she writes the line in here because she was rejected and she says i go to the stone that the builders rejected i just love that line there's a lot of good lies in the summit this is my favorite anyway [Music] where do i go when there's no one else to turn to who do i talk to when there's no one who wants to listen to the while in on when there's no foundation stable i go to the rock i'm always able i go to the rock i go to the rock of my salvation go to the stone the build is rejected i run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me the earth all around me is sinking sand and christ's the solid rock

praise the lord it's a great song 10 30 a great song and it's uh it's true she could have been called to fanny crosby at this this age for sure amen well god rest her soul amen because she wrote some beautiful songs amen praise the lord let's uh let's sing 979 before brother john comes it's uh ancient words praise the lord the ancient words that are never new to the believer as god continues to unfold his word to us all to his children by grace amen holy words long preserved for our walk in this world they raise with god's own heart oh let the lord of god of god changing me changing we have

morning lord as we've come in with open hearts or we come in with open lives lord we want your word to impart its power it's strength it's correction lord it's love it's joy it's healing lord we want every part of us to be surrendered to all of your word this morning lord take this lord this sermon that lord i've studied for him prepared lord and may you and fill it lord with yourself or may you speak lord may you anoint lord may you just touch lives and hearts we pray lord lord it's foolishness lord but if you'll come lord it can be powerful it can be real lord it can be life-changing so lord we pray you touch lord speak have your way in your people in this service lord in your name we pray amen amen thank you sister maureen certainly appreciate that amen if we'd stand together for the reading of the word we'll turn to leviticus chapter 23 this morning leviticus chapter 23. good to be back in service again this morning another set of faces another three new faces amen but each one's good it's good to see the ones that we haven't seen in a while and just trusting that god will bless each one that's uh back home uh online amen leviticus 23 familiar scripture if you remember from brother mark preaching on the feast but uh we're going to start here this morning and and then move forward with another portion of the on the royal seed so leviticus 23 verse 33 says and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying the fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the lord on the first day shall be in holy convocation ye shall do no servile work therein seven days shall you make an offering made by fire unto the lord on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein these are the feasts of the lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations to an offer to offer an offering made by fire unto the lord a burnt offering and a meat offering a sacrifice and drink offerings everything upon his day besides the sabbath of the lord and besides your gifts and besides all your vows and beside all your free will offerings which you give unto the lord also on the 15th day of the seven month when you have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep a feast unto the lord seven days on the first day shall be a sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath i mean just let's keep reading i don't have it in my screen here but just reading it in there i wanted to continue just so you'll you'll recognize some things when i reference them later verse 40 says and ye shall take on you the first day the bows of goodly trees and branches of palm trees and the bowels of thick trees and the willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days and you shall keep it a feast unto the lord seven days in the year it shall be a statute for ever in your generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh moon ye shall dwell in booths seven days uh all that are israelites born shall dwell in booths that your generations may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in booths when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god and moses declared unto the children of israel the feasts of the lord amen you can have your seats this morning may god bless the reading of his word amen we're finally going to close in on the last portion of the royal seed series so i want to take a title this afternoon or this morning on the final harvest and this is a part one so we're on the 10th part but the first part of the final part if you can keep up with that so i'm not sure how many services we're going to take probably two or three but this morning i just want to be conscientious of the people online i don't want to drag it out too long this morning just try and hit it hard for an hour or so maybe and we'll see where the lord will take us but i want to speak this morning on the final harvest and we're going to set just a foundation this morning this is very much just setting the stage for the next service or two as we continue on this but doing a quick round up we uh spoke initially of the germinating season and then where we talked about the predestinated believer where there is a seed of god inside them there's a seed gene of god as brother branham called it and it was an incorruptible seed it was that spora that peter talked about and he said this is incorruptible it doesn't recognize anything but itself it can only respond to something that is of itself and it will only feed on those things and that's the only thing that brings it to life and brings it to full maturity is the very thing that is within it in the first place amen and we know that one day god shone a light on each one of our lives there's some maybe he hasn't shot it on yet just in that way you know but if you haven't accepted him as your savior if he hasn't filled you with the holy ghost but there is a day where he shines a light on you and that life springs up within your soul and that is god's life within you that he placed in there from the very beginning amen then we moved on to the growing season we spent a lot of time with david and going through his trials and hardships as a young man as a teenager in his early 20s and seeing what god puts a real son or a daughter of god through you know and how he tests and tries and he puts things in front of you over and over and over again until you recognize what's happening you recognize what you're supposed to do in that situation then we looked at abraham the the father of our faith amen the the one who had the initial promise that applies to us and we showed all the struggles and the trials and the pitfalls he faced and yet at the end it was all imputed to him for righteousness say man god looked past the mistakes and the failures because abraham kept coming back to the promise kept coming back to god coming back to the path that he was supposed to be walking and god honored that and he was imputing it to his righteousness amen but amen we want to now move on to the final thing we talked about the growth we talked about the or the birth and the growth and now we want to talk about the harvest what does it look like when the believer is about to step into the fullness of the promise because even abraham didn't get the fullness i mean all of these we're looking forward to the scripture says in the book of hebrews they all didn't they all look forward to it but they never received it but now we're in the harvest season we're in the time when everything is the culmination of the gentile age and this is where we're going to see the final harvest we're going to see the final fruits of that promise that he gave to abraham that as it applies to the gentile church amen so we want to just set a bit of a foundation here this morning like i said so what is the harvest in this last age what does it actually look like and we know brother gerald's been preaching on it for for years i think and it's the resurrection and the rapture amen that is the culmination of all of this is the resurrection and the rapture but there's a period of time before there where the harvest is being gathered in and if you look in the scriptures it says you know the harvest is great and the laborers are few and pray that the lord of the harvest will send gatherers to you let send laborers to you to bring them in because there's a gathering that has to happen and then there's the final taking away amen it's gathered in everything else is burned but they're taken in and there's something that happens in that short period that final session there where the fruits are being gathered in amen i started in this scripture in leviticus which brother mark covered extensively through a couple services we know and i loved when he was preaching it because i knew this this series or this portion of this series was coming and he just placed it so beautifully there and i was just i wanted to be shouting and dancing in there because there were so many things that were jumping out at me and i knew i was going to be able to use it hey man i knew that i was going to be able to take that and just place it in some really neat things here so i certainly appreciate the lord leading them in that direction and laying it out so clearly and then i asked him for his notes yesterday and said hey can i just have them real quick because i want to verify some things it saves me a couple hours of work you know to do that so i appreciated that but it's just laid out so clearly and you can see so many types and they're beautifully of the gentile church in this last age amen and i love that we can go into the old testament i was talking brother gerald about this on thursday and i love how we can go into the old testament the new testament is is the new covenant that's really what that is and that's really the bride's book if we could talk about that's the gentile bride's uh set of scriptures there but it's all been typed through six thousand years amen and in the old testament we can go back and that's what paul did paul preached out of the old testament paul didn't have he was writing the new testament but he was preaching from the old testament so everything that we're talking about in the new testament we should be able to go back and find the types and shadows in the old testament amen and so i love how we can do that and we can go in and we can see ourselves in these things brother brown said if you can't see christ in every scripture go back and read it again and if you're a part of christ you should be able to see yourself in the same scriptures that we read amen so this morning i just want to focus more on that 39th verse because it's talking specifically it kind of wraps up this whole idea of the final harvest and it says also in the 15th day of the seventh month when ye have gathered of the fruit of the land so when the harvest is over now he says you'll keep a feast unto the lord seven days on the first day shall be a sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath so we see this as a final feast celebrating the harvest of the fruit of the land the barley harvest has come in the wheat harvest has come in but this is the fruit harvest now this is the scrumptious stuff this is the succulent stuff this is the really tasty stuff i mean this is where the real enjoyment of the food comes in if i could put it that way and then when you bring in barley what's barley good for it's good for your bread and and those different things your cereals right who's sitting here this morning saying i would just love a thing of shredded wheat right not if you could have your apples and your oranges and your strawberries and all these different things amen the grain and the barley harvest was a staple it was to carry you through and no matter what the fruit harvest did if you had a good grain harvest of the fruit of the wheat and the barley it'd carry you through to the next year and then it was a staple it had to happen you had to have that to to go through and if the drought wipe that out then you were hooped for the next year or two right you couldn't catch up you needed those staples there but then the fruit harvest comes and this is really the cherry on the top i mean this is where you get all the good fruit salads and the pies and the jams and everything this is the things that makes life more enjoyable and that's what we're talking about this is the gathering in of those things that are the peak of enjoyment they are the peak of all that's been done through the year and the thing is with grain you kind of just put it in and then it goes there you don't have to do anything to grain once you put it into the ground you plant it in the ground and as long as it it's watered then it comes up but with fruit you have to tend it you have to care for it amen it's not something that just comes out naturally if you leave a fruit tree to its own on the wild it won't produce nearly as much but if you can prune it and tend it and and do these things to it like we talked about with the vines and whatnot then it'll bring forth a lot more and that's how you get the most out of it is you have to carefully nurture this thing day in and day out week in and week out you don't just leave it to itself and we see that's what christ has done right as he's tending us and he's taking care of us through all these things he doesn't just plant it in and walk away but he's working with us right that's the growing season as he's working with us and taking all of these things out of our lives and adding in what we need so that will bring forth this amazing crop at the end you remember the parable of the the sower and the seeds and what is it some bring forth 30 60 or 90 or 100 full but all of them bring forth something they've got to bring forth something otherwise they're cast out hewed down and cast into the fire amen but this is really a celebration time the final harvest and the final feast is a celebration time it's a time to kick back and enjoy the fruits of the labors that have gone on through the year everything's into the into the garners now everything's been brought in it's been stored up and now it's time to just enjoy what you've done throughout that year amen it reminds me of that scripture in psalms 34 where it says i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth this is what they'd be going through at that time my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear their of and be glad o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and deliver me from all my fears and many deliver me from drought he delivered me from pestilence he delivered me from the insects that were coming in and all these things he kept my stuff when the philistines came in and tried to take it away you know this is a time of remembrance of all that god has done that's good it says they looked upon him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles i guarantee the farmers never have a year where everything goes right and this is what they're talking about is it he came and he helped me and he brought me through it and he gave me what i had need of the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them it says oh taste and see that the lord is good why blessed is the man that trusteth in him this is the blessings come from those that have trusted in him and looked to him and taken him at his word and taken him with what he said and said lord we're trusting in you it's up to you this is your work i'm doing what i can but we're trusting in you to give the increase it means like paul said you know this one watered and this one planted but it's god who gave the increase amen so this is the time where the proof of your labor comes out this is who proves who was sitting in the house through the hot summer days and just saying it's too hot and it's too sweaty and there's not enough water out there and i'm not going to go out and waste my time and waste my energy on this and the ones that fought through it and really just put their whole heart and soul into the land and into those trees and those plants and whatnot those are the ones that have the great harvest at the end amen so we know the natural harvest was to do what celebrate your work it was all about what you had did that year it was the lord that had blessed it but you're the one that put in the hard work amen but we're talking about a spiritual harvest now because we're talking about a gentile dispensation we're talking the end of that and so we know it's a spiritual work because we've been talking about a royal seed that's spiritual all along so you have a spiritual seed that was born that grew and now it's going to be harvested so this is not a working of our hands and then we may enjoy the fruits of this but it is not the working of our hands we have a work to do and we'll get into that probably in some other services it's not our work to do but it's his work that he's done and we're just the beneficiary of it amen this has always been a story of grace it's him from start to finish and we just happen to have a little bit of time and and effort and strength that we put into it but it doesn't add to it or take from it it just brings us into alignment with what he wanted in us all along amen but this is a celebration for the believer that the word has become a full reality this is the final stage and this is where you see in your life exactly what they had in that book of acts amen what was it the beginning is at the end it's the alpha omega principle what god was at the very beginning he is at the very end and you'll even see that when we talk about these sabbaths and that it was also a time to put away differences in wealth we talked so much about equality today and equity in these things and really what this was with the boost was this was a putting away of all the wealth and the trappings of life because we read in the scriptures there where they had to go out and they had to take good bowels from trees and build these little they calls them tabernacles but there are booths it's just tiny little rooms basically where they put up some posts try and build a little bit of shelter and shade from the sun but that was it and they had to live in them for seven days they didn't have this big celebration in their mansion on the hill you know it didn't matter if you had a big house a small house a big farm or a small farm everybody lived in just these little booths they didn't have two floors they didn't have multiple rooms it was just one big open room you didn't have decks or anything like that air conditioning nothing it was out there and everybody lived in the same thing for seven days it was everybody was on the same playing field afterwards they could go back and some be poor and somebody rich but for this final one we're all in the same playing field we're all in the same position we're all the same amen and every person they were dwelling on what it was when they came out of israel and they lived in tents it was a temporary nature of their dwelling place and whatnot and it was a time of simplicity and thanksgiving that's a time of simplicity it's not about what you have it's what you've been given and the blessings of god in your life amen now brother brown and brother mark cover this again uh just just quickly that the seven months of the planting and the harvest even season and the seven feasts within them represented the seven church ages if you go into future home then he talks all about that and he talks about those different types in the old and the new testament and how they reflect the christian walk and the christian church and then you have israel typed in there and that you had all these things and brother brother mark covered it extensive extensively and i don't want to go into that but the point is that we're living in the fall season this is where at the end of time i was talking brother mark before and he said you know it it's in a circle when you look at it on a calendar but from beginning to end it's you have the planting season and then you have a you had an early harvest of barley then you had a harvest of wheat and now you have a harvest of fruit and that's at the very end now we're up here now right in a timeline we're at the very very end but you've got a cluster of three feasts there and all of those matter to the bride they all matter to this age we're talking about the fruit harvest but the fruit harvest is surrounded by these three feasts and there's three things that happen inside of there i'm gonna go over them really quickly just as a reminder and then we'll push on through so we know the fifth one was the feast of trumpets and that was an announcement and it's a prophet's voice typically in the scriptures and for us it's malachi 4. right we heard a trumpet we heard a voice and it was the message of william branham restoring the people back to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers we know how did he do it restoration of the original word that's what he said he had to get us out of our dogmas and other denominations and creeds and these different things so our scripture for that is malachi 4 verse 5 says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that was john the baptist in the first coming and the hearts of the children to their fathers and that was william branham in the second coming lest i come and smite the earth with a curse amen this is holding back a curse until this has to happen and he holds it back for the bride and then she goes and then he comes in and he does it for the jews just before it goes off on them as well so two of them have two different things happening we have a coming and they have a coming and he holds it off until so we can get gathered up into that and then he does the same thing with the jews but i want you to catch something here and that's that this season was announced with a trumpet and if you missed the trumpet then you couldn't set your calendar for the rest of the month if you didn't heed the trumpet if you ignored the trumpet or you didn't hear the trumpet then you wouldn't know when the feast of atom when the when the feast of atonement was and the feast of atonement well we'll get into it i won't jump into it there but needless to say if you miss the trumpet or if you don't listen to the trumpet then you're going to miss the atonement because you can't set your calendar right so then you move on to the sixth feast and that's the feast of atonement as brother mark said to the christian this is a time to remember that christ didn't just cover your sins but he actually took your place and fully paid the price this is a time of remembrance you should have already sacrificed the land and it's saying you got to remember what you did and did you do it as brother mark said this is a time to make sure that you got what you say you got right but it's it it's uh the feast of the trumpets for us was that prophetic messenger blasting out a message and that message said you've got to get back to christ you've got to get back to the purity of the word otherwise you're under a false atonement you're making a religious covering for yourself rather than accepting the pure blood of christ and you've got to get under the umbrella of the restored word now you say jonathan you're equating the word to the blood of christ but remember we're looking at christ the word christ is not just a man that walked the earth 2 000 years ago because before he was ever a man he was christ the word john 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was for god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory so before he was ever a man he was the word and so you've got to recognize the word and that's the thing that covers you and they didn't they didn't recognize christ the man they missed christ the word that's what they were missing in that thing and so we've got the same thing today the full truth was revealed and it was placed in front of the people of this state and they had to choose again all over again he said you can stay in your denominations you can stay with your creeds you can stay with your fellowships and guess what you can stay with your signs and wonders and speaking in tongues and people running around and shouting and dancing or you can have the revealed word and that will be in it to a degree but you got to take the full word and he says now you've got to make the choice and they didn't they they turned it down they turned it down it reminds me of hebrews 6 they tasted a part of the word right they were it's a restoration so they had a taste of the holy ghost brother brown said they they took the gifts and they refused the giver there was a portion there they tasted of it but they didn't get the full measure and in hebrews 6 it says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come that's azusa street all over they were sincere there was nothing wrong with the azusa street that was exactly god's moving there there was nothing wrong but they refused to come forward after that those people that were in azusa seat the original ones they're going their bride they were but what happened was they denominated and they stayed with the gifts and they would not go into the word again it says if they shall fall away to renew themselves again to repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put them to an open shame that blah blah says this is proof that if you have the fullness of the holy ghost if you've been sealed you cannot fall away but he says you can taste it you can have a portion it can fall on your body it can fall on your spirit that's a taste of it but it's not a sealing of it it's a taste of it and when you do that and then walk away he says there's no more you can't repent after that you've turned away that and you've crucified the son of god afresh amen you have to recognize the word not a man right you don't have to recognize a prophet you don't have to recognize a sermon you don't have to recognize a ministry you have to recognize the word because the word comes in so many different forms once that prophet left we've got a five full ministry to pull it through right that are bringing it to the people but we've got church members that are the word the exact same way and your neighbors and your co-workers have to recognize the word in you if they never hear it over a pulpit right there's many things that they have to recognize so they may say i never went to a message church how do you indict me and he'll say but you had mark coffey that was the word you didn't have to see a man you had to see the word in mark coffee amen that's what he's talking about what is it the people won't accept the fullness of the word and brother branham comes through in 1963 and he says i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ he says and now upon this basis i challenge this generation of the crucifixion of jesus christ for crucifying and guilty with dirty wicked selfish denominational hands has crucified the prince of life that wanted to present itself to the people and you say the same person he says in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was made flesh and manifested itself the word was manifested in flesh and they condemned the flesh and put it to death because the word was manifested hebrews 13 8 said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's the same word see and for the same reason they are trying to crucify the word the same reason why did they do it initially it was jealousy right he had what they didn't have he had what they had talked about what they had prayed about what they had seen in the scriptures and he came and we talked about it just last last service he healed the blind man and they said who did this jesus did it this man must be from god they put him out because he identified him with with with god right he did what they were looking for messiah to do in terms of the power but they couldn't recognize him in the flesh amen and he says they're doing the same thing today and that's what happened with william branham was god's there using that vessel and he gives the full messiah sign start to finish you can't you can't say anything other than that he showed the full messiah sign right he could lay his hand on you or he could stand back and he could turn around not look at you and he could walk through that audience boom boom boom scripture says jesus knowing their hearts right knowing their thoughts he didn't have to touch them and we had that same thing happen in this day and people look at it and say yeah but his doctrine's wrong no it says he says if you don't believe my my words believe my works and you have the works coming over and they couldn't accept it it was the word coming forth in power and demonstration not just in word and they turned it down because they were jealous because he didn't identify with them he didn't acknowledge them the job was for them to acknowledge the word not the word to acknowledge them when they acknowledge the word then the word comes back around says that's my son that's my daughter but he doesn't acknowledge you first and say you're my son you have to say you're my father and then he says i'm your son right you're my son but despite this there were people that said that's me right there was that eagle that mother eagle flying overhead and they said that's me i identify with that that's what i've been looking for and man that's how this church started brother mark amen he's sitting there and he says this is it this is it and then from that we have everything grow up because one person recognizes and then all of a sudden that eagle scream is going out and other people are hearing it and other people are hearing it and pretty soon you've got a body of believers here because one person recognized who they were god comes down and confirms that all of a sudden we get the growth that we did amen amen then the third feast so we had the the feast of the trumpets then they had the feast of atonement that's a time to make sure that's the time to make your calling an election sure that's what we're talking about here like brother mark said to make sure that what you say you got is what you got then the seventh feast is the feast of tabernacles and that is supposed to be the dwelling place for god and it's made from temporary frail materials amen this is temporary frail materials that we're talking about amen we're in sinful bodies sinful flesh unredeemed minds unredeemed spirits unredeemed bodies amen but we've got a soul that's redeemed but inside of this is where god dwells and it's a temporary dwelling amen he won't dwell in this forever right there won't always be this contentiousness that's here that's why he gives us a new body so it'll take the contentiousness away amen but those people that have made their calling election sure that are under the blood of the word amen those are the ones that come into this feast of tabernacles and this is where the fruits come in now and this is where they get that enjoyment that's when they get that rest and that's when they get to kick their feet up now don't take me wrong we've talked about battles and battles and battles all through the series kicking your feet up does not mean that there's no battles what it means is that your soul is at rest and we'll touch on that shortly amen brother braham says this again we're speaking of the feast of tabernacles and what it takes to be in there he says the requirement of him today is the blood of his own son jesus christ the token and the token of the holy ghost we haven't got it we might be baptist presbyterian lutheran pentecostals whatever we might be we might shout scream and be also educated that has not one thing to do with it you must present the token which is the holy ghost he says then when you present the token you are a subject for the resurrection because the resurrecting power is already in you like i said when we talked about healing the other day and we had that i don't know if it's still here or not no it's not so we had the body here and every we were talking about looking at healing and deliverance and all these things and it's outside of you he says no you're a candidate because it's in there you're subject to it because it's already in you and that's the recognition that we have now is the fruits of the spirit are going to bring resurrecting and quickening power in our lives he says the token is the resurrection power showing that jesus raised up from the dead because if he didn't raise he couldn't give life to us but because he lives we live also right in the same life that's in him is in us and that's the thing that quickens our mortal bodies he says and you are raised from the dead the dead things of unbelief and has been made alive in the word of jesus christ you believe it and the word lives through you it's so simple you believe it and the word lives through you because there's a life inside of you to make it live in the first place amen all of these feasts are part of the fruit harvest and you have to be in all three to get through to the final in you miss one then the clock goes off and all of a sudden you're not in the right place at the right time but the key point now is that we are in the feast of the tabernacles this is the very end of all this we've already heard the message right we've already had the word and we've already accepted the word we're under the shed blood we've accepted christ the word for our day and now he's dwelling with us in frail tabernacles amen and once this is over the gentile dispensation is over there's nothing to come after this it's done it's done it's done the rapture happens the resurrection happens we're gone and he's back to the jews and that's a totally different situation all over again amen but if we look at this and just to read this scripture and i'll just put it up there for reference it happens this feast of tabernacles it happens across eight days but you notice it starts with a sabbath and it ends with a sabbath right and if you don't enter a sabbath at the beginning you don't enter into a sabbath at an end right you've got to be in the sabbath at the start to be at the sabbath at the end you've got to be in the rest at the beginning to have rest at the end amen and we know the sabbath was a rest day and how do we enter into that there's a rest that is for specifically for the believer amen matthew 11 jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest there's a promise now he takes it a step further in verse 29 he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls not just rest but he says rest unto your souls and that's the rest that we're looking for there's only one rest and that's when your soul is sealed with the holy spirit amen like i said we've been talking about the battle that we face and so this rest is not in the body this rest is not in the mind this rest is not in the spirit but it's a soul rest that we're entering into not a body rest amen we still get old we still get sick we still get tired and we still have the frustrations of life and all these things satan is continually coming against us but he says you will find rest unto your souls and it's because it's sealed to the day of your full redemption which is the rapture and the resurrection amen and once we go through that period of time after those seven days we go into the eighth date and that's another period of rest and brother brown takes this and brother mark pointed out and brother brahm says there is no eight day he says on the calendar there's only seven days in the week there is no eight day he says you come back to the first he says and it's the loop of eternity he says now you've stepped right back into eternity and we're back with god we're back at the beginning we're back where we started we're in the same condition we were but you've got to be in that first rest so you can set the timing for the second rest amen because he says we're we'll still be in the we'll still be in the in the feast of tabernacles he said in the millennium he says it's only after the millennium he says that we step into the fullness of rest because there's no more things that happen after the millennium amen there's no more battles and everything there's still one last battle at the end and then we go into a perfect union with christ amen so he says we'll still be in there for that time but you have to be in that initial rest which is the sealing of the holy spirit of your soul to get all the way through to the end amen brother braham says this the feast of tabernacles was the last feast the seventh feast we're worshiping now under the feast of tabernacles the seventh church age he says in the millennium will be under the feast of tabernacles again in the seventh day but then after the seventh day we have a holy convocation and we go back into the eternal how by the eternal one that came and redeemed us and taken us back letting us recognize that we were part of this he's pointing back to your identity and says this is your this is him proving that you always were a part of this you always were an eternity you always were a part of god he says now how do you know you're a part that's a good question how do you know you're a part of this he says because at the word of the hour the promise of the day what is it a restoration back to the first day the first and he shall restore the hearts of the children back to the fathers that's malachi 4 5 bringing a restoration again of the pentecostal genuine not sensations what he means is not only sensations because you'll still have sensations i have sensations sitting in here listening to the song service or sister mooring doing a special or something like that sensations don't go away but he says it's not only sensation it's not based on sensations and says and will manifest so the pentecostal genuine and will manifest the evening light the same sun that showed in the morning light as promised for this day he says amen and amen so be it so be it alpha and omega beginning and end amen amen he says how do you know you're a part of it if you have the genuine pentecostal experience the same things that they did you do the same faith that they had you had the same attitude they had you have the same life that they have you have all of these things if you can't place yourself in the scriptures for the pentecostal day the original pentecost then you're lacking something now you say today i don't have what they all have yes but we're in a restoration he's bringing us back to the fullness now you may see sparks of it here and there and everything but the thing is if we go back to the fullness they were in perfect unity there the holy spirit was moving it was keeping the church clean it was keeping sin out it was convicting but it was moving in their services it was healing it was delivering all these things were happening but we're being restored back to that and so you're seeing sparks of that and just here and there and everywhere right you see these miraculous healings and deliverances and and what going on that's all a part of it but the thing is that they lived a life despite all the persecution despite all that was against them but the signs and wonders still have to be there as well we don't get to write that out of the scripture it's all part of it and it's a restoration back so don't look at it and say well i don't have that so i'm not going in the rapture no it's a restoring work we're coming back to the fullness amen and it's in a body of believers not just in one of us brother braham says this he says thy word is the truth and every man that'll read the bible and believe every word that bible says and follow its instructions now don't just stop there lots of people say they're doing that and receive the same holy ghost that they received right do what it says follow its instructions and receive the same holy ghost that they received the same way they received it because you've got lots of people saying today i've got the holy ghost and they haven't followed acts 2 38. right they haven't so they don't have the same holy ghost they've got a different spirit on them and so he says you've got to do what it says follow its instructions receive the same holy ghost the same way they received it with the same results they received it the same power they got when they received it he knows who his mom and papa is that's a long list that's a long list and god help us because we can't make this happen in and of ourselves this is a restoring work and it's up to him to do it in us now that person he says he knows he's washed in the blood of jesus christ born of the spirit filled with god's unction he knows where he's standing sure he's in canaan he knows where he come from he says that's the way it is with a real christian ask him ask her have you received the holy ghost since you believed and the answer is amen brother i have i have received the same thing they've got i've got the same thing they've got i've got the same holy spirit living and working in me amen you don't want to miss that you can't miss that you have to have it this is the token that brother brown spoke about you have to present the token it is the holy ghost the exact same way that they had it at pentecost the exact same way there's no excuses we've got the full word revealed there's no place for ignorance anymore so all that's left to us is to believe it if you believe it and accept it and obey it he says then it'll follow all the way through for you amen our baptism of the holy spirit and their baptism of the holy spirit should be exactly the same thing they meant so each one of us has a portion sometimes we look in there and we see the apostles walking around we think that's got to be me guess what that's pressure for the ministry if i could put it that way because they're the apostles they're the ministers of the day right but you don't see dorcas going around laying hands on people but what do you see you see the power of the holy spirit raising dorcas from the dead some of us have to be the ones that are lifting up and some of us have to be the ones that are laying their hands on right there's a portion for each and like we talked about in the last service some of these things are honest so that the works of god could be manifested in our life amen some of us have to be the ones that are afflicted and some of us have to be the ones that are bringing that deliverance it's not me right it's not a minute not a minister it's the power of god working in those men or those women as the case may be to do the works of god in this day amen i think sometimes we think that they're running around laying hands on everybody and they had eight million you know healings throughout the church there no no we see a period of years over there and you might see 5 or 10 or 15 miracles that are written about that doesn't mean there weren't more but that wasn't all of their life paul didn't come around and start laying hands on everybody and doing miracles paul came and preached the word right then when eutychus fell out the window because he was preaching such a long time he laid hands on him and he was raised from the dead and then what did he do he went back to preaching today if we raised from the dead it would blow the church up we wouldn't be able to sit still brother gerald would have to sit down because we wouldn't allow him to continue anymore and paul went down laid hands on him raised him up and then went back to laying in the word for the people because that's what they needed right the holy spirit was there to do the work that was required and then it went right back to bringing those people into alignment into the revelation of the word so that they would live it out in a better and better way right he was bringing them deeper and deeper into christ the works are there to support the church but they are not there to define the church if i could put it that way the definition is is to be in the word is to live the word in every part and aspect of it amen what is it it's this place of rest is the leadership of the holy spirit that's quickening the word for us today making us not only hearers but doers of the word because if he's leading us then we've got confidence amen if we can say he is the one that's doing this i would not step out this way i would not do this of my own free will i would not make such a statement i remember brother ron spencer talking to him or he actually mentioned this over the pulpit and he said you know when he talked about certain things and and he prophesied and said something was going to happen and then he went into the office and he said why did i say that and he said but i didn't say it that's why i said he said the holy spirit spoke through me and that's why i said it and then it takes five years for that to come to pass and every day every month something worse happens to make what he said more and more impossible to come to pass and then five years later all of a sudden there the miracle is and it's happened why because the holy spoke it holy spirit spoke it not ron spencer that's the same thing we're doing when we step out in faith when i come up behind this pulpit it is 100 by faith because it's foolishness otherwise like i prayed at the beginning i can prepare and study but if he doesn't come and quicken it it makes no difference and we'll have a dead denomination in this church all day long same thing for brother gerald if the spirit does not come and quicken it then it is dead dead dead it will only convict us and it will indict us but it will not make us live but if the spirit's there to quicken it then we've got something now that he can use amen that's what we're looking for and that's where our confidence is is not that i'm doing it it's that he's doing it through me amen paul talks about this rest in hebrews 4. he says let us therefore fear lest the promise be left of us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it he says there's a promise there make sure you don't stop short make sure you get all the way into this rest for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them now he says us is those that have received it he says as well as unto them which was the jews but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest though the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day in this wise and god to rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest he's saying god's talked about arrest all through scriptures and he's talked about those that won't enter in and those that will enter in and he says it's all been finished from the foundation of the world right so it wasn't a surprise to god when the children of israel turned their backs on canaan he knew right but there is still a place of rest and there's a people if there's a place of rest there must be a people of rest as well he says verse six seen therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein so you're saying there's still more to come not just that we've entered into it now in his time paul's time but this is an ongoing promise this is more than just for them in that day there's more going to come into this rest and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limiteth a certain day saying and david today after so long a time as it is said today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day he said if it happened in jesus day then he wouldn't appoint it to another day and it's the one that we read right he says i will give you rest therefore there remain or there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his that's the rest of the believer that it's not me but it's christ in me doing it i have ceased from my own dead works my own desires my own ideas my own imaginations all these different things i've died from that and it's christ that's living in me right now and in verse 16 he says let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need why because it's not your work you're coming to him you're saying you called me you chose me now i'm coming to you to finish the work because i definitely can't do this on my own and then i can't do it on my own but when i am quick and when that quickening power comes down then i say i can do all things through christ that strengthens me amen i'm recognizing my place in him and i can step forward in that faith now you say why are we talking about rest we're preaching on the harvest season but the harvest season is is finished in rest it is a time of enjoyment it is a time of of taking in the good things that have come through and you have to enter into a rest where you recognize that it's god's blessing and god's work and that's not you and that's when you can relax that's the time when you can say it's been him all along because when i compare myself to the other one right next to me whether it's the person at work whether it maybe it's the person in the family they've got the same genetics or they've got the same skills the same education this that and the other thing and i've got something that they don't have and that's only because of christ amen but it's only going to be a small bit of time that this happens we're talking about a restoration at the very end because the rest the initial one didn't last that long right and then and then john said you left your first love right 60 years was it something like that 50 years 40 years whatever didn't last that long it's going to be much more compressed here because the tendency will be to do what they always did and that's nominate it right build up clicks build up crews whatever it's going to be and move on with it he's going to do a quick short work romans 9 28 says for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth amen and you're going to have ministers that are just like the apostles in pentecost you're going to have deacons that were like the deacons you're going to have prayer warriors and faithful people just like they did and then peter's in jail and they all get together and they're praying and all of a sudden the doors are open for peter amen there's a massive deliverance there and walks them through what was it three or four gates i think three or four sets that all had to open up for him and he walked through boom boom boom every single one knocks on the door and she thinks it's a ghost she was probably the less faithful one you're praying for it and it comes to your door and you say you're dead you know it's uh it doesn't really encourage you maybe amen but uh i'm trusting we're not all like rhoda amen but what is it it's alpha and omega god's restoring us back to the exact same thing and you'll see the mighty works but you also see the humility you'll see that subjection to the spirit where they're lifting up because everything they did they say we do in the name of jesus christ we don't do in the name of jonathan corlett or gerald lush right it is all in the name of jesus christ whether it's singing it's in the name of jesus christ whether it's going to work it's in the name of jesus christ whatever it is it's all in the name of jesus christ and they testified daily of jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ they took nothing to themselves right paul said i'm the least among you he's the apostle for the age he's the prophet of the age he says i'm the least among you i was the worst sinner of all of you right he did not even he couldn't even see himself being lifted up in that way right it was always christ christ christ christ and that's the fruit that's coming out is christ christ christ when we see ourselves lifted up brother brown said what an arrogant spirit is never ever ever from god and an arrogant spirit is when you inject yourself into it and say this has something to do with me it's not it is christ from start to finish amen so let's start talking about some of those mature believers and men in the context of the harvest now one thing's for sure if there's a harvest season happening there's no question as to what you are because the harvest season is when you see you may have seen at the beginning the tree standing there and there's no fruit on it and if you don't know much about trees then you can say well that's an apple tree but you don't know because there's no fruit on it somebody that really knows it does but not you don't but when the harvest comes now the berries are out the the fruits are out all these different things the vines have put out the grapes and that's when you start to see what that actually was and it's in the harvest season that you get a confirmation of what somebody already was right they were from the beginning but maybe the fruits are only coming out just now but again it's not just fruit because the scripture speaks and we'll get into it in a little bit about evil fruit and good fruit so you can have fruit that looks the same and the only way you know what it is is if you take a bite of it right you can have an apple tree that's got sour apples and it looks just the same as the one that's got the sweet apples and then you don't know until you take a little nibble from that and say is this a good one or is it a bad one you have to taste the fruit matthew 7 jesus talks about this he says beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves so the outside looks the same as everybody else but there's something else driving them and it's a it's a destructive spirit ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil evil fruit so you can have the same type of tree with the fruit being poisoned with the fruit being wrong looks exactly the same you have nothing on the outside maybe that would tell you that there's something inside that's different but he says a good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit and some people it's very obvious some people it's very obvious you only have to conversation with some people and you know that the the fruit is rotten right that it's sour it's there's something not quite right there the sweetness isn't there but there's some people it takes decades to bring it out because they're going through the motions and they've got a religious covering like brother gerald's been talking about and that can take you for decades for that fruit to come out right and you only have to look around newfoundland to see it unfortunately that's all you have to look around and see you you know one day we'll give our lives for the seals no you won't because he wasn't in you right there's nothing in you to keep you until that point even you know verse 18. a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire and then when it's tasted and it proves that it's wrong thing out it goes you don't dwell on it you can't fix a corrupt tree that's what he's saying is it's corrupted right it's not that the fruit's bad it's at the tree's bed and the tree is bringing forth corrupted fruit then he says you can't do anything with that you got to cast it down into the fire you got to cut it down he says wherefore by their fruits you shall know them now listen to this he says not everyone that says unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven amen lots of people identify with the bible lots of people identify with jesus christ with christianity today he says look there's going to be lots of them saying that but they don't all get into the kingdom of heaven many will say to me in that day at the judgment day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works now you can see one person of note in the scripture there that's judas judas could come up and say lord didn't we do all those things right judas didn't fail at the beginning judas did three years five months three and a half four weeks he failed in the last week other than that judas was the same as all of the other disciples until the very end but he had some corruption showing through there and then he met up with the priests and these different things and it started to show what was inside him but judas could come up and say all of these things so if you're looking for signs and wonders and you're following signs and wonders you're going to get tripped up it isn't just that amen you can go to a benny hinn revival campaign and get healed why because god honors faith it's not about benny hin it's about god honors faith if they preach the word and you come and accept the word god will heal you regardless of who's doing it right so you can get healed there as much as you can in a message church but that doesn't make benny hing going into the rapture right jesus said so he doesn't say you didn't prophesy in my name you didn't cast out devils and you didn't do many wonderful works he doesn't say that he says and then i will profess unto them i never knew you he didn't say you didn't do it he says i didn't know you you said you knew me but i didn't know you and the word there is an intimate knowledge amen it's a marital knowledge if we could put it that way for a mixed crowd he says i didn't know you intimately i had nothing to do with you it was you trying to come to me but i never came to you he says i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity that iniquity we know i've covered it before is to not do the things that you're supposed to do because in verse 21 there it says but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven you got to do the will of god and then he came and says you worked iniquity you knew the will of god i showed you the word of god i gave you a message in your day and you turned it down and you went and did things your own way and you built a kingdom you built a ministry to your own self rather than to me and then we talked about the two seeds of faith and doubt when we were going through the the battle for the gate and these things and each person's life is going to have one or the other if you don't have life you automatically have doubt that's it there's only two if you don't have life then everything else is doubt right so if you have life if you have faith then that's going to conquer all of those other things but if they disbelieve brother braham said one word he says one word got us into this and you've got to believe every word to get you out of it he says if you turn down one word you're lost you're lost if you turn down one word right he says it's gonna take all of that to get them back and the ones that have done this that all they've done is they've disbelieved that one word and they've stepped away and said that's not for me or that's not true brother brown says there's a revival going on this is 1962. what is it a sewing you don't hear very much of billy graham no more do you what about oral what about the rest of them you know the great revival is not fire's not burning what is it it's the end time seed sign he says the words has been sown what is it denomination will reap denomination they sowed it and that's what they get that makes them confederate themselves together but the word of god has been sowed also that's a that ought to give us a rest and a peace he says the word of god has been sold also and when the spirit of god begins to fall the word of god will live in the people and that false bride that's committed adultery out there and brought herself into creeds and sold out her birthrights will we reap what a confederation of churches that's to be bound and burned like the thorns and thistles but where the word of god's been sowed into the people's heart it will reap a bride for christ as certain as i am standing here end time signs he says there's two harvests here wants to be bound and burned and one's to go into a rapture it's a ready-made bride for him amen what is it it's the parable of the sower the good seed's owned by god and the bad seed sown by saint two seeds in there you gotta they both have to come up and they both have to mature and show what they are before they can be separated amen brother brown continues he says now another great seed was planted he said in the last days in second timothy the third chapter that there will come amongst the church of falling away from the bible faith that's right is that a seed is that a promise look at them today look at our churches and what are they doing they're organizing themselves together they're cooperating together binding themselves together failing don't believe in the bible don't believe in the real true word of god that's what you see today that's right that's all you see is that it's a bunch of shouting and dancing and they want to worship all day long and they want a 15-minute sermon right they want an emphasis on the feeling good and the affirmation that you're okay and you're gonna make it rather than align with the word of god obey it and find life amen choose life you say the bible says this and they say them things are past there's no such a thing oh there's no such a thing the days of miracles is passed a long time ago there's no such a thing as the baptism of the holy ghost that was for a handful of people 12 back there the apostles see what is that seed it's maturing it's the end time signed seed what did jesus say when you see these things happening lift up your head your redemptions drawing nigh to the church we seen she would fall away all right so we notice then that the maturing of the bride is always surrounded by a falling away that's what he's telling us because if you go all the way back into the beginning when they were coming into canaan what happened there was a separation of faith and unbelief wasn't there it always comes up it comes to the time of decision will you go in or will you stay out and that's a separation that's god that's doing that work it's not satan this is god doing the work he lets it go so far and then he says now the fruit's got to come out we've got to do the separating because to go into the land to go into the promise to take the fruit right because they went in at a time of harvest do you remember they went in they brought out the big thing of grapes and all these different things they went into the land initially at a time of harvest came out and the people refused to go in right they refused the fruits and then he says you got to go ahead and claim the fruits but only the faithful can go in there it was only joshua and caleb two out of millions that went in and that was it everyone else denied the promise wandered around for 40 years they had an early death they had an early death because of their unbelief and caleb goes in and he says i'm as strong as the day i went in the first time i went in he says i'm 40 now i'm 80 and i don't feel a lick different why because faith is the thing that was working in him and unbelief killed all those other people amen no different today and brother branham says it's the end time seed sign you point to this scripture in first john 2 it says little children it is the last time now he's not talking about that day but he's talking about what's happening in that day because they saw falling away but this is a scripture specifically for us today little children it is the last time we're in the last feast folks we're at the end of the harvest this is it and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with it but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us that's the working of god because god wants to make it clear these are not to be identified with my bride and so a separation has to come there and it's god that causes it it's god that draws that line there we've seen this happen in the last 10 years within the message haven't we we saw people that put decades in the ministry into service into working with the bride great man and what did they do boom all of a sudden separation comes and they're out and what are they preaching today they know too much they know too much of the message right they go into a denomination and it's like a human walking in and having a conversation with a chicken they can't stay there because they're so far below their level of understanding not revelation understanding because it was revelation they just stuck with it but they go in there and they talk to those people and it's so silly and they know it's so it's so juvenile right there's nothing there for them because they know so much but they can't live the life that that was preached to them because they didn't have the holy spirit and so what do they do they go out and they create their own little groups and they preach of love and acceptance because that's the only thing they have left because they can't live in overcoming life can't live in overcoming life without the power of the holy spirit that's what we've been reading right so they don't have the holy spirit they can't take the full revelation of the message but they can't go into a denomination because they know that that's that's corrupt as well so they're making up their own little groups and they're preaching these little isms for themselves yeah we're all good and what are they doing they're reassuring themselves that they're still going to make it even though they've walked away from the truth right as we read last service having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away there's no power to live in overcoming life that's it they're done they've walked away right they tasted and they walked away god's grace that maybe they could find repentance it's a shame you think of jeff jenkins or someone like that you know put decades into it decades into it and then to walk away the way he has it's a shame maybe god will grant them grace we don't know it's up to him i guess but john gives us a beautiful finish a consolation and encouragement at the end of that chapter he says and now little children abide in him after all this he says abide with him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him so he says that we may when he appears we may have confidence why because we've been doing the will of the father right we are living the life of christ we have the mind of christ we're living the life of christ we'll have confidence and then john says you know that he's righteous and if you're doing righteousness then you're born of god and he says that's your comfort is that the righteousness that you have your own is filthy rags but you've taken on his you've taken on the mind of christ you have the life of christ he says so everything that you're doing is the very proof that you are born of god he says so be encouraged stick with it stay with what you've learned stay with what you've been taught if it's having the effect it's supposed to stay with it and that's going to lead you to not being ashamed when he comes you'll be able to lift up your head because your redemption's dry now not to turn your head down because he's coming in power and glory and judgment right you want to lift it up because he's coming for you not because he's coming to judge you and then take it back to hebrews 13 this is brother branham's scripture amen hebrews 13 8 but verse 7 is the key one because it says remember them which have the rule over you he's speaking of the ministry who have spoken the prophet you know himself and these things he says who have spoken unto you the word of god that's how he identifies who has the ruler viewers the ones that are teaching you and preaching to you he says whose faith follow but he puts a condition he says considering the end of their conversations so in other words he's saying follow after people who have the right kind of life conversation is life or lifestyle he says so follow after people who have the right kind of life not just at the beginning but all the way through and then that's why a pastor has can't be a novices because you've got to know that he's right you've got to know that there's a fruit that follows him to make sure that you don't put someone behind that pulpit to teach you and feed you that's got a corrupt seed inside of them amen and that's the dangers we when we don't do that all of a sudden we've got problems in churches because you haven't proven the man there needs to be a proof of a life behind them before they ever get to inject life to you because you want to trust that they're going to give you christ's life not their own life that they don't introduce man seed as the serpent did but that it's god's seed that's coming forth and that's what the people are feeding on amen otherwise you get a big mess he says and what is their conversation what should their life look like verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and that's what william branham did more than any other man in this in this age was he came up and he showed jesus christ from start to finish false failures absolutely there's no denying that he's still a man but he showed the works he showed the attitude and he showed the faith and he showed the dedication to the truth of the word amen and that ought to give us faith that we can have the very same thing that we have the same thing amen that he's going to bring us to the exact same place not in gifts and signs and wonders necessarily but he'll bring us to that exact same place where he could we can have the very attitude and response that christ would have and as he showed it in william branham when we're reading his life story and our family devotions it amazes me sometimes how things would come up to to just challenge him and you know it would rile us it would it would drive us nuts sometimes the the petty things that people tried to do to him and he would just breeze over it because why he said like jesus we must be about our father's will right we're always going to have naysayers we're always going to have critics we're always going to have people trying to hitter us ignore them and just keep moving because god's with us god's not with them just keep moving ignore it and we're okay to go amen so paul continues here he says so check their lives that it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that they had it yesterday they have it today and they're going to have it tomorrow is what they're looking at that christ is exemplified in their lives and then he says be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meech with some which have not profited them that have been occupied they're in amen you ever see people that are flip-flopping doctrines constantly and they're chasing after this minister and that minister and this one have you heard this have you heard this all you need to look at this guy he's got the greatest revelation he's got the newest thing paul saying don't do that because you haven't checked the fruits yet it's there you can take it you can say okay let's see what it is but he says you don't dive into that because there's no proof of what's behind it he says it hasn't profited them that are occupied therein says look at what it's producing and then let that help you decide whether or not that's true because they can give you the truth but if they've got a wrong attitude or spirit attached to it and you get sucked into that now you get pulled into a cult right and you're going to take on the attitude or the spirit of that minister and it's not going to be christ they could be right in their doctrine wrong in their attitude and that's why you're looking at the fruits not just the words amen but we don't just want to look for ministers to be like that right we want to be like that our conversation our lifestyle has to be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if we're going to go in that harvest amen what went down into the ground what jesus said right unless the corn and wheat fall into the ground and die it can't be raised again the same thing that went out it's got to come up again at the end and so we're looking for the very same life the very same attitude the very same responses like i talked about the very same leadership where our life is about the will of god start to finish lord what would you have me do today i've got to go to work you've still got to do that but lord how do i interact with people where am i going to go what am i going to say how am i raising my family right what's my portion of the body selena was was you know she's looking for what to do after after she graduates and whatnot and and she was she was looking for advice and one brother said look at what you can do for the body of christ in your career i thought that was a great idea you know when i picked my career i picked something that played to my strengths and that would that would uh you know not keep me in university too long but you know and you're looking for leadership but i didn't really look at it as how i could benefit the body of christ but if i could have done that maybe at the beginning i don't know maybe i would have done something different i don't know but i thought that was a great way to enter into a career is how can i benefit the body of christ and what i do day to day right we got to pay bills we got to have a house and pay for vehicles and educations and all these different things but how can i do the the thing that will take the body closer to a rapture amen what can i do that will build up rather than pull me away and cause disruption in my life and cause a separation between my spiritual life and my career if you could put the two of those things together where god can be a part of your day-to-day life where you can be anointed to do things i think of joe you know he's got a business here that's that's that's uh got a few people in the church employed i think that's the grace of god right and that's the leadership of god that's working there to give him that unction to bring those people in and it's been a tremendous blessing to him and a blessing to them that's great i think that's just god moving within us amen but i love how it says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you can't rest only on what he did for you yesterday right you want him to be looking today moving today and you want to be ready for what's coming tomorrow and then it's a preparation it's a confirmation what he's done it's an expectation and a constance today and then something that's coming for you tomorrow you're looking for him from backwards to front looking behind and looking forward and looking at him today he's there from from start to finishing man amen brother brown talks about how he was the great i am not the great i was not the great i will be he is the great i am he is the ever-present god in our lives amen and our lives have to reflect that but the brown says there's only one heart's desire and that is to see jesus christ glorified their conduct must be with god we're talking about mature believers now we're talking about harvest ready believers it must absolutely nothing else but just the glory of jesus christ he says and what is jesus the word that's right now notice and seen his same vindicated method proving his resurrection now what is it seeing your life by his promised word that he said he's the same yesterday today and forever proving he's still alive how do you know you're the ones that the bible speaks of do you know your position is in christ if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living to you can we specify that could that be our testimony today this word is an everyday living to me every day all day right not just a portion not just when i have my devotions or when i wake up and i read our daily bread but all day every day is the word like everyday living he says why sure it's yours you're an eagle that's your food and like i said we're talking about mature believers we're talking about rapture ready believers and it is the word every day living in them we're talking about people that are showing the fullness of the fruits of the spirit fullness of the fruits of the spirit but the brahman says and when the man and woman gets into god complete now not under some spell not under some emotion but because what we see people you have a special meeting and they come in and the anointing is so strong and the conviction's there and they run up to that altar they've been there 17 times already and they keep coming up and in that moment and they're weeping and then they're happy and they're great and i've got the holy ghost and three weeks later they're right back where they were right he's saying that's not what we're talking about not under a spell right not under a temporary anointing not under a temporary spirit but really when the word in him becomes one god has saved that person sanctified him from the things of the world renovated everything of the world away from him and the fire of the holy ghost lives in that person reflecting himself that perfect man or woman living by the word see that's the earth cleansed he's talking about the fire that's going to cleanse the earth but he says there's a fire that cleanses the earth that you have and then he's talking about that he's referring to earth and vessels which is second corinthians he says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels now listen to why we have it in earth and vessels listen to why we have it in earth and vessels now and not in a glorified body he says that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us why because we're in a fallen condition he says the only way you can do this is that it's by the power of god and that's why we're in a fallen vessel so that everything that we do makes it obvious to ourselves amen we know what we were before we got the holy ghost amen i know what i was completely useless worthless right couldn't do anything right not nothing godly that's for sure and then he says you have the excellency of the power of god may be of him and not of us because we knew what we were and we know that what we're doing oft times our body our spirit is rebelling against what it is and yet we do what we don't want to do why because the holy spirit is in us that unction is in us that power is in us just driving us forward to do something that you don't want to do when you've got to make that apology that you don't want to do it's the holy ghost right it's the holy ghost when a minister gets up here and says hard things and he knows he doesn't want to say it he knows somebody's going to take it personally but he'll do it anyways he'll put himself in a place to be hurt or rejected because the word is coming out of him and telling him to say something that he doesn't want to do amen how many times did brother bram say i hate to say this i don't want to say this but i say it because i love you right when you'll go in and you'll make something right when you twist something just a little bit and then you have to come back around to that person say i didn't quite give you the full story there what is it it's the holy spirit doing that because everybody else just moves back to past that and says it's no big deal right and what is this the holy ghost keeping you clean so that he can keep moving and you he can keep moving in the services he can keep moving in the body and he can use you and he says it's the power it's that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us that's that's my testimony i'm not here by anything i've done or any desire i've done and every day it is only because he keeps pushing me to do it that i am able to do it day in and day out amen but look at this beautiful thing as we go through these last three three verses here he says so we have this this treasure in earth and vessels he says and we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body notice how despite difficulties despite trials and tribulations and persecutions and these things the believer is never overcome and what he's talking about here trouble trouble is exterior and it can be interior amen you're fighting your flesh or you're fighting somebody else's flesh right one way or the other he talks about we're perplexed we don't know what's going on we don't understand what's happening we don't have a revelation or an understanding of it but he says we're still not in despair why because we have a confidence that this treasure in earth and vessels is there for a reason and it's going to carry us through regardless and god has a purpose and a plan in all of it and therefore we stand regardless we do not fall into despair we are not completely annihilated or destroyed we are not broken down but we stand there amen the holy spirit raises the standard of the word and we stand there and hold hold hold fighting every time until it brings us through and we're on the other side of the trial amen that's what he says a mature bride is a treasure in earth and vessels and can go through all of these difficulties and come out smelling like a rose so to speak amen with the holy spirit just bringing the sweetness in their life amen this is the fruit of the holy spirit it's easy to have a sweet attitude when things are going great when there's money in the bank when your health is good your marriage is good the kids are behaving you have money in the bank but take a lot of that away take one of that away and see what happens paul says that's not the believer that's not the mature believer he says it doesn't matter what we're going through we aren't going to get cast down from our position in the word brother brahm takes it and he he puts it this way a very simple scripture he says he wants us to be one with god and god is the word each individual not churches not families each individual in his heart must be that one with god that's what we're talking about that's an end time bride that's getting ready amen the rapture is for a people that are a perfect reflection of christ as a body as a body amen because he spreads it out amongst all of us in all of us we have a perfect reflection of him does that mean we live a perfect life no what do we do under the atonement it's not our righteousness it's not our works that takes us across amen doesn't mean we're not we live a perfect life it doesn't mean we don't make mistakes but what does it mean it means that we are under the blood of christ and we accept believe and act on the word for our day and we are led by the holy spirit that's a perfect reflection of christ they recognize the word they are the word and they act according to the word amen remember we read that prayer about jesus in the garden of gethsemane where he talked about the unity he said said lord it can't just be about you and i they need to have the same thing that you and i have he says not just with me but with you and there's a interesting triangle that happens there we're not going to go into godhead but i want to read just a quick portion there in john 17 where he says that they all may be one as thou father are to me and i in thee that they also may be one in us but there's a reason for it he says it's that the world may believe that thou has sent me that's why he has to come into us is that the world may believe that he has sent us as well that he has called us that he has created us to be his special reflection amen his perfect bride and the glory which thou gavest me i've given them that they may be one even as we are one amen that's the baptism of the holy spirit i in them thou and me that they may be be may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me amen our unity is to cause people to believe on christ and to believe that he is here and he has a people and he's working in a people amen brother brandon put it this way and we'll close with this we've got a lot more to go but i'll just leave it here i think for this morning he said and as he being the groom had the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom then it isn't the bride that says very simple test very simple test are you doing what christ did you're the bride if you're not then you're not a part of the bride because he says it's going to act exactly the same way why because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power that's when you start getting into motives and objectives not just actions and then we start to get real deep with this where it's not just what you're doing it's why you're doing it and how you're doing it that matters equally well he finishes and he says she is him as men and women are one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side was made both mechanics and dynamics we'll get into that a little later mechanics and dynamics it's built right and it's got the power to make those right things move he says the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made the mechanics and the dynamics amen just more if you would come sing a song this morning amen but this is about a mature crop this is about mature believers and lord willing as i whenever i'm up here next we'll we'll go into what that starts to look like and get into some of the attributes and identifications of that bride because we talk about she is the word but what does that look like right what was the original church like and what are we supposed to look like and what did brother branham point to and say these are the promises for our day specifically this is exactly what we're going to be looking for amen but there's going to be no distinction that's what brother bram says there's going to be no distinction between your life and the life of christ that's an amazing thing to believe it's an amazing thing to reach for and the thing is it can only be through him amen it's the only way we're going to get there it's not going to be anything we inject or anything we add it's going to be him from start to finish amen let's just stand if we would and we'll pray lord jesus lord we're so thankful for your promises lord every time i open your word lord it's just promise after promise lord is grace after grace it's mercy after mercy lord it's power and faith that just come pouring out lord as we've read this this morning lord though we're trusting your spirit has gone forth and quicken these things lord that our heads are lifted up lord not turned down in shame or regret lord that they're lifted up in faith and expectation that you are moving amongst us lord lord we see you lord we feel your presence so often lord we look for a fullness of reality in our lives heavenly father lord help us to surrender lord help us to humble lord help us to repent lord help us to just be in full obedience to you lord may we just look for the good things of god lord not for our own self lord but may we look for it for the good of those around us lord may we have a body mindset lord where we're looking out for the good of the others around us as well heavenly father lord we pray your grace to each one we pray for our pastor lord jesus may you just minister grace to him as he would come on wednesday lord may you just fill him with the fire of the holy spirit as he speaks or give him strength lord give him an unction and a message for us we pray lord bless us now as we worship or may you just touch hearts and lives we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen amen do we know that song who i am oh glorious victory that day he set me free okay i am marked mark marked i am mark now wherever i go 216 brother matt amen you've got to be marked today you've got
