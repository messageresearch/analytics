[0:00] fivefold ministry will be pointing to
[0:02] the people and the bride on to the
[0:05] resurrection and the rapture whatever
[0:08] they're preaching is to create a greater
[0:10] hunger and a greater thirst for the
[0:12] resurrection and the rapture amen and if
[0:15] the Ministry of the word is not creating
[0:17] that in us then there's something wrong
[0:18] somewhere
[0:19] amen it's not just focusing on this and
[0:22] on that no no we when it comes to these
[0:26] doctrines and this over that brought us
[0:28] out of denomination what we're out now
[0:30] so now we've got to preach the word to
[0:32] get in by the grace of God and to get to
[0:36] create in the end the Saints a hunger
[0:38] and thirst to get out of time and into
[0:41] eternity by the grace of Almighty God he
[0:45] said remember I preached on God hidden
[0:49] and revealed in humility in simplicity
[0:52] and he said you Millett II he said
[0:55] always said don't forget that and he
[0:58] said remember when God predicts anything
[1:00] great to happen the people are going to
[1:03] so far away by their wisdom till they'll
[1:06] miss what happens that's right don't
[1:10] depend on ourselves just keep trusting
[1:13] the Lord and seeking the revelation of
[1:15] the resurrection rapture I'm green
[1:17] thirsting for it and if you're humming a
[1:19] thirsty for it God is there to give it
[1:21] to us by grace he wants that that's what
[1:24] girls look for in us do you want the
[1:27] resurrection do you want the right oh
[1:28] yes Lord what do you see what you're not
[1:30] hungry for it you're not thirsting for
[1:32] it if you're wanted you hunger for
[1:34] thirst for pray for it call for it look
[1:37] for it morning noon and night day in day
[1:40] of grace of God be with us
[1:42] amen there are other quotes in the seal
[1:46] book we'll leave God have mercy on us
[1:50] and help us is my prayer that we'll want
[1:53] to get out of Satan's eat let's not be
[1:57] numbered with those that the prophets
[1:59] said right here
[2:02] and I know we'll remember this or not
[2:06] but he said it's the truth
[2:17] he said listen he said to see the
[2:19] deceitfulness of the enemy he said we
[2:21] never had a day like this day that we
[2:24] are now living that's true it is the
[2:28] most cunning deceitful day he said when
[2:31] I see that it brings this that the
[2:33] Christian has to be more on his toes
[2:35] today he said then he ever was in any
[2:40] age oh yeah because this is the end it's
[2:46] now or never
[2:46] oh yeah it's nice I'm moving on what
[2:50] God's going to do this no it goes
[2:51] finished it so great grace of God to get
[2:55] out of here into glory so be on your
[2:59] toes more because it's the most
[3:02] deceiving of all ages be on your toes
[3:07] and he said but now the cunningness of
[3:10] the devil now makes the people to
[3:12] believe that they are Christians when
[3:15] they are not and he making people
[3:18] believe they're believers when they're
[3:20] not why again I've mentioned it a few
[3:23] times recently where the problem of God
[3:26] said he said you are in the message but
[3:29] the message is not in you
[3:31] I pray grace that the message is in us
[3:35] us here the message is in those on line
[3:38] by the grace of Almighty God amen to God
[3:42] be the glory hallelujah
[3:45] let the musicians come
[3:49] and we're saying I love it return to our
[3:51] brother Bob raised the name of the Lord
[3:54] hallelujah amen
[4:03] there was a quote here I don't have it
[4:06] marked regarding about something to
[4:09] prophecy concerning the rapture he said
[4:12] the rapture is going on right now and he
[4:14] said the bride is being raptured or
[4:18] being caught away from this world and
[4:20] we're being caught into the rapture it
[4:22] was tremendous
[4:24] well I find that another time I'll share
[4:26] with the priests shared with it with the
[4:31] Saints amen
[4:35] Gracie oh he said here third seal
[4:42] he said the bride as an added revival
[4:44] yet there has been no revival no
[4:47] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[4:49] we're looking for it and look was it
[4:52] gonna take we got it now he said it will
[4:56] take those seven unknown thunders to
[4:59] wake her up again the bride hallelujah
[5:02] he will send it he promised it a man and
[5:06] his two at what is to wake the bright up
[5:09] and to give her the hunger thirst that
[5:13] she needs at this hour by the grace of
[5:15] God to get out of here god bless amen
[5:19] let's keep pressing on amen we're not
[5:23] going to stop we're gonna keep moving
[5:24] out by God's grace the Lord blesses and
[5:28] as to much longer we'll go on with
[5:31] services like this we don't know

[21:46] this brave
[21:55] amen
[21:56] I'm glad to be a part of the family to
[22:00] bless the Lord and I would say this that
[22:03] I was here the other day just working on
[22:07] defense and voter Chad and it's just
[22:12] early I pulled off as they saw me today
[22:14] they pulled up and one of the things
[22:18] that stood out we had in conversation
[22:19] probably a short period of time but it
[22:21] was it showed something brother Branham
[22:25] talked about and what you talked about
[22:28] too is that is the longing for each
[22:30] other and that's what really stood out
[22:33] in that conversation and I sense that
[22:35] that love and they were so glad to see a
[22:37] believer they were so glad to see
[22:38] somebody from the church and and the
[22:42] longing that I felt from the two of them
[22:45] was it was really strong and I said
[22:48] that's right that's exactly right and
[22:50] I've been thinking about that ever since
[22:52] and you know when we do see each other
[22:55] because we've been apart so much and
[22:58] they're longing gets stronger and and in
[23:00] talking to people over the phone the
[23:02] book that the believers over the phone
[23:04] the longing is getting stronger every
[23:06] day to come back and get in the house of
[23:10] God and worship so
[23:13] it really stood out God really showed me
[23:15] that that's what brother Graham said
[23:17] about you know people crying because
[23:19] they're not gonna see each other until
[23:21] the next service and that's what I came
[23:23] back to me you know so but I got rebuked
[23:27] though because Jared Jeremiah said I
[23:30] wasn't six feet apart from other chant
[23:31] don't I had i've been rebuked right so
[23:38] I'm heaven I gotta apologize in advance
[23:42] to the musicians but I'm having a
[23:44] brother mark moment here I don't know if
[23:49] you know one of you guys might know it's
[23:51] just a chorus is 810 updater man and
[23:56] it's ending I think it's in the record
[24:00] of D but you know this
[24:08] that's it yeah that's it so nothing
[24:13] that's right so what I heard this a VCF
