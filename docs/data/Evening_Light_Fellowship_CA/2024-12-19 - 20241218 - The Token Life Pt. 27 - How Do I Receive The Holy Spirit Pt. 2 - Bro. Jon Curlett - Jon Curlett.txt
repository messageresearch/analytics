each one here I know we're missing brother Chad and the family just praying God God's grace to them that he continue to heal them and touch them my eye is doing a lot better it's not 100% but I'm again out of an abundance of caution I'm just trying not to irritate it so I'm wearing glasses but definitely thankful it's feeling better then want to remember brother Bob and sister brend as they head out from us uh tomorrow they got to be with them as they travel it's good to see brother Grant tonight having made it through all of his exams I guess at this point amen praise the Lord trusting he got through without any issues amen want to remember just by way of announcement Friday night we have the Christmas event for the young people at doors open 5:30 we'll eat at 6:00 please let uh my wife or sister Priscilla probably know about that if you're attending or if you haven't let them know and then Sunday of course we have this special program for Christmas where each of us each of the families are going to do something I'll speak a short amount probably Lord willing then we have the lunch Fellowship after that so everyone's welcome uh sister Nikki and jine are are traveling on Sunday as well to Jamaica for a couple weeks so we want to remember them by God's grace we should see them on Sunday but um we'll want to remember them as they go as well amen God bless you also remember of course sister Violet Ellsworth is in a horrible condition but we pray God's grace and comfort it's good that she's got family there to help out for sure and just trusting God to be with her and brother Ellsworth as well amen acts 238 very familiar scripture it says now then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening as you can imagine we're continuing our series on on the Holy Ghost and I want to take a a second service on how do I receive the Holy Spirit and before I do I wanted to make a clarification from last service since I made such a big deal about uh about the the scripture that I'm about to talk about and I stand by my comments and I stand by my references but I got some things kind of crossed up when I said it and I was quoting that scripture Matthew where Jesus said go into all nations and uh and and bring people into discipleship and he says baptizing them into the name of the father son and of the Holy Ghost and and and what happened is as I'm studying I'm always on my computer I I have my Bible there uh sometimes but usually I'm just reading electronically and so I will have different versions of the Bible open at different times and so what I had was the Amplified Bible open when I read that and so when I read it and I said I I read into the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost I said I've never read that that way how did I miss that and so what I read was this so I read in the in the service I read the Amplified version but indeed the King James version says in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost so we weren't repeating it wrong all along but what we were doing I believe for most of us certainly the way that we read it is we read it the way that Peter said it in Acts 238 which is baptizing them in the name of the Lord G of Jesus Christ and that is not the same as the word in in Matthew 28:19 that word in Matthew 28 28:19 means into and it means to change your position or your condition it is not doing it in the name of Jesus Christ it's not doing it on the basis of Jesus Christ This is a baptism that brings you into the name of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost it's a baptism that brings you into Jesus Christ and the only baptism that'll do that Paul said in in Corinthians was that it was by the one spirit amen so it's a holy spirit baptism that he was talking about there not just water baptism so I want to clarify that you weren't reading your Bible wrong I don't have a wrong Bible you don't have a wrong Bible but usually when I'm studying a scripture I always take it back to the original language and I'd never really studied that scripture that much it seems so straightforward and simple and we've heard it many times but sometimes you just need to go look at it it and God will open up something and I believe it was a good thing that I did that amen so we'll come back to our service this morning or this evening on on how do I receive the Holy Spirit and I want to spend some time on this verse here it says for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off and I want to really dwell on this because if we can see what what Peter's talking about here we'll never limit who the Holy Spirit can come down and touch you know we look so often I remember brother Isaiah Brooks talking about a young lady that came into his church one time and she had green hair and she had tattoos and she had studs and chains going from every different orifice and and extension of her head and her body and she came into a service and she received the word of the hour and she was baptized and she was converted and she received the Holy Spirit now you wouldn't think that somebody walking in off the street in one service could have that happen but Peter's talking about a whole bunch of different people here when we look at this and we cannot limit it based on how people look and how they talk where they're at in life how they're raised and these sorts of different things amen it's God that knows it's God that calls and you'd be surprised who responds to the word you'd be surprised how some of the people in this church looked before they received the holy spirit amen I remember I don't want to tell I'm Blanca's parents but I remember seeing a picture of her mom and her dad before they got saved it was quite scandalous if I was to be honest amen some of us were not some of us some of you some of you were definitely not the way you look tonight amen and and I remember brother Mark telling me when he went up to to to gr Falls they almost didn't want to let him in the door cuz he looked like a beatnik or something like that with long shaggy hair and and these different things amen but it wasn't them that was calling them it was God that was calling them and God knows how to find his children amen so Peter says yes it's to you but he's saying it's not just for you people today it's not just for the ones that are present here today but it's to your children it's to them that are far off amen and you know I've seen many times that people are more concerned about their children than they are about themselves but often you we've got a we've got a realize that it does us no good if we're pointing to somebody else and we don't get what we're trying to give them or we're trying to get them to get Peter starts off and he says first of all it's for you don't take this message don't take this revealed word don't take this moment and say this would be good for somebody else make sure you're included first brother Braham says if there's going to be one person going the Rapture make sure it's you amen I believe it's a I believe scripturally we know it's more than one but if it was to only be one you ought to have this confidence that I've received the word and God has come down and he's confirmed himself in my life in my soul and I'm going to make it if nobody else does Amen but after that he says it's for your children once you get it now God's got somebody else to work with we see on the day of Pentecost he had to get somebody to get it first brother mam said you want Revival in your church he says you get your fire lit don't say God touch somebody else don't say God go to do a work for somebody else say God do a work in Me God change me God do something for me that'll make somebody else want what I've got amen so let's not look to our children to get something we don't have yet but once you've got it now God's got somebody to work with so maybe he can use you to do it that's what he did with Peter Peter couldn't give anybody the Holy Ghost Peter couldn't even preach the inspired word until he got the Holy Ghost but as soon as he did he converts 3,000 people by the preaching of the word that's what it took amen it's got to start with somebody and I say God let it be me God let it be you let it be the the one that's praying let it be the one that's that seeking for somebody else but in ourselves we can't do anything God's still got to do the work but if we can get ourselves out of the way God can maybe do something and we can see a life in our children that's changed amen but so often what happens is people want it for their kids and what happens is they they just set them up for failure you know we've had people asked to have their children dedicated in this church and we always have a chat with them beforehand and you say have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus no I've never been baptized do you go to church no I don't go to church well why would we dedicate your child if you're not dedicated yourself there's no dedicating a child if the house isn't dedicated to God if the parents aren't dedicated to God then how is that child going to be raised in the nurture and admonition of the Lord we'd just be giving them a lie it'd be a Catholic lie that because I prayed over that child or because I laid my hands on that child that they're now dedicated to God we don't dedicate our children because we've taken them up and the pastors prayed over them we we dedicate them by living a life according to the word of God and setting an atmosphere in our home really this is just a formality that that is an expression of what we're already doing and that's that we're dedicating their lives to God by the lives that we live and the house that we have that we raise them in and we hold things according to the standard of the word of God Amen but I'll tell you this Jesus blessed children and I'm happy to do that and I've told people they met there we've talked to people that were divorced and remarried living common law and they have a child and what happens so often seen it in my own family even uh that they have a baby and and they don't themselves care about their own Souls but they care about the soul of that child and so they start to talk to you and they say how do I make sure my child is saved how do I make sure that my child is not going to be judged how do I make sure that my mistakes won't affect my child Jesus when they brought the children to him he blessed them doesn't say he dedicated them but he'll pray a blessing on them if you want your child prayed for all pray over them Absolutely I'll say God give them grace and mercy and turn them into a child of God but we can't dedicate them to him if the fames not dedicated themselves amen but the greatest mercy God gives our our children as parents that are living according to the word of God that have been filled with the spirit amen but I want to focus so much for a bit here on this thought of for them that are far off and when we look at that so many times and we're not wrong when we think it we think well it's those that are coming down the road we think that that you know knowing what we do now it's those that are coming in the the the ages to follow and the 2,000 plus years that are going to follow we think he's talking about all of those down the future and that's true but it also means those that are far away from where they ought to be and and if you look at the the root of that scripture it can talk about a long time a duration of a of a long period it can talk to those that are way away from where they're supposed to be but when Peter talks about this thing of those that are far off the root of this word is that there are those who are under the patience and longsuffering of God even in their Condition it's not about how far they are it's about the patience and longsuffering of God that's calling them despite where they are amen that no matter their condition no matter it's almost like the the you know that that story of the rich man that died and there was a vast Gulf between him and God this scripture is speaking of those that it seems like they're such a vast Gulf that they can never come to God that their lives are so messed up they're so filled with with drugs or alcohol or partying or rock and roll or religion as the case may be that there's no getting through to them this scripture is for them those that seem unsavable that seem so Bound in Pride and self-righteousness that are lost in the things of the world this scripture says those are the ones that this promise is for for those that we think are unsavable untouch table unmovable that's what this is for the ones that we think it's impossible for them to come this promise is for them literally what he's saying is This Promise is for anywhere a child of God is found you look in the scriptures they're found in a lot of different places aren't they you got Rahab a a a prostitute in a in a in a city that doesn't even know the Living God that worships idols and guess what he went and her you got a woman at the well that's that's got a blend of religion that doesn't know if she's coming or going she's broken she's broken she has no hope she she can't even raise her head probably to pray to God she's so messed up and guess what he still found her look at zakus zakus was a cheat nobody likes zakus he he had turned on his own people and yet on his way to go to to Jerusalem to be crucified what happened the Holy Spirit found him Peter was a coward Peter was a coward and he walked away in a time of Jesus greatest need and yet the Holy Spirit still came to him after he' gone off fishing naked Peter had gone back to his old ways and the Holy Spirit still came and found him what a promise that is it says God saying this is God saying you can't go so far that I can't get you remember what David said if I dwell in the depths of sea if that if I if I lay my head in Hell behold thou art with me that's the kind of Holy Spirit we're talking about when we say who can get the Holy Spirit how can they get it it doesn't matter where you are he can come and touch you he can drop in the the strangest of places for those of us that are praying for family for for siblings for children that are gone out for members that have left this church whatever it might be I say God knows where they are and if they're his child the promise is for them that are AAR off they may not even know who they are most of them don't some have been running away their whole lives some don't even know that they're a child of God and the Holy Spirit says I'm going to go find them this promise is for each and every one of them amen listen to what Paul would say a little further on in Romans 9 he says that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he has a for prepared under Glory remember there's vessels of Wrath there's vessels of Destruction and there's vessels of Mercy look who these vessels of Mercy are they're they're not vessels that have mercy they're vessels that receive Mercy he says even us whom Heath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he saith also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and I will call her beloved which was not beloved so you have is Israel that was chosen remember he calls Abraham and Jacob and Isaac and all those different ones and they have this promise to come out but in the book of Hosea he says I'm going to go to those that aren't of the lineage of Abraham I've got a people out there and their vessels to receive mercy and they don't have a clue and I'm going to call them beloved who I've never called beloved before before that all they got was judgment all they got was God using them as a tool to to chastise Israel for their unbelief and then God would come in and he'd wreck them up again and they had these ups and downs of being used by God and then discarded by God horrible people and idolatry and and their lives and shambles and sensuality and all these things and God said out of those people I'm going to find vessels of Mercy I'm going to call them beloved who's the Beloved church it's the Bride of Jesus Christ he says I'm going to go get people that don't even know who I am and I'm going to turn them into my multinational multi-member bride he says and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God he'll pull them out of situations he'll pull them out of religion he'll pull them out of common law relationships he'll pull them out of rock and roll he'll pull them out of wherever they are and you say God isn't in it God's not in him but he's got vessels of Mercy that are embedded in those places and he comes along and he steps and he grabs them out and he says you're mine you're mine you're mine you're mine we're blessed to be born into this but not all of us were and God in his great predestination knowing those names on the Lamb's Book of Life came down and said I don't care where you're found what I care is what's inside of you cuz I placed it there and he's coming and he's seeking after that which he has planted a long time ago that's what he's doing in these situations he's going out to where you say there's nothing there and he says I've got one I've got two and you don't know who they are and you won't believe it until you see it who my children are listen to what brother Braham says he says he redeemed you a seed that was forn by God whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that Gospel Light of the Resurrection the confirmation of the word he says how did we know he was the Christ because he proved what he talked about he says How will I know the message of the hour he says God proves what he promised and he talks about it that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he has talked about now let me stop there because we have to be honest in our lives we have to be honest in our walk with God in our relationship with Christ we have to be able to look at ourselves in the mirror of the word and say this is where I am it's not wrong to say I'm not where I ought to be I'm not to we what he promised it's okay to say that but we don't ever want to stop there amen but notice what did Brother Ram's talking about here he says God proves the word by bringing it to pass but before he can prove it he's got to bring it and how does he bring it he brings his word he talks about it he shares it with us amen he tells us he warns us he gives us light of events that are ahead of us we can look in our Bible as I've said so many times in the past few months and we can see exactly where we're at by the word we know exactly where we're at we know we're at the end of the end we know we're at the end of the seventh Church age we know that we've been called come out of her my people we know that it's an individual Affair we know that it's the time of Revelation 108 amen we're past the prophet now now we're at the place where we have to take the book and we've got to eat it and it's got to do something in our lives this is where we're at we know it by the word we know it by the conditions around us so he yes he shows us things but the thing is he promises us as well he promises us a resurrection he promises us a Rapture he promises us healing he promises us a changed life amen he promises us a glorified body now do I have all of those working in me in their fulfillment this evening they're working but I don't have them all I don't have the fullness of it yet amen human speaking when we don't have something we don't like to talk about it God's the opposite God says though you may not have it though it doesn't appear yet I'm going to talk about it because when I talk about it it happens and then the Holy Spirit comes behind it and it makes it come into reality amen but there's that period of honesty we've talked about the trial of our faith between the promise and the talking and the proving or the reality amen and that's where we have to be able to say I know that he's my healer I know that he's my provider I know that he's my guide even though I don't see it now brother Bob sang that song the Healer before I came to the platform on Sunday and my eye was bothering me so much and I said Lord that's for me so many times I'm praying for other people sometimes I've got to stop here and say stop looking at everybody else and say Lord let your word be born in my body today listen my soul is sealed but this body needs the word this evening amen my life needs the word this evening my family needs the word this evening not just sit here and get and I'm not getting caught up in my high horse by God's grace but sometimes I have to check myself and say listen this is not just for those that are listening this is for you that's talking too what's good for the goose is good for the gander I need his healing touch and by God's grace it's gotten better since that service it was getting worse and worse and now it's getting better and better but it's not there all the way but I'm still saying he's my healer I'm still saying he's my provider I'm still saying he's alive and well that Jesus Christ is is not dead amen but he's living in me to tell the world that he's alive today amen that doubt not to stop us from believing or confessing the word but we know there's a gap between so often the believing and the receiving but why do I believe it because I'm a part of it that's why I believe he's come to me he's revealed himself to me he's revealed his message to me he's told me you're a part of me I didn't respond to Barry coffee the night I got saved I didn't respond to Donnie Reagan I responded to the almighty voice of God Calling My Name saying you're a part of me and it was so personal that I knew that a man had nothing to do with it that's what the word is supposed to do because remember the new birth is a personal revealing of Christ to me as an individual not a member of a congregation not a member of the klet family not a member of The Message Church in St John's Newland or conception Bas but to me because my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's why I believe it amen that's why I'm here tonight amen we're a word bride swn before the foundation of the world written our names into the Lamb's Book of Life amen and so we're trusting the process we're trusting the word that we've received that the holy spirit's coming behind it and it's moving even when we can't see it he says what he promised to do in Christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of Moses he proved it what he promised in the days of Enoch he proved it and in all the days of the Apostles he proved it he says now in this day he proves what he said because why because they are a part of the sea that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to God again he says oh what a message that's a message that they received on the day of Pentecost amen they received a message that said this is the season for Joel 2:28 this is the season for Ezekiel 36 it's for a pouring out of the spirit on you a new heart a new spirit and then the personal Spirit of almighty God and it's for you it's for your family it's for your children it's to everyone that will respond to this word that's the message that they heard amen and then they lost it and then they lost it and for for for church age after church age they fell away why because they forgot what gave it to them in the first place they forgot where it came from it was not it was yes it came through the voice of Peter but it came from the Throne of God it was the word the revealed word coming to their hearts and it was the work of the holy spirit that started it and what did they do they turned to men they turned to ideas they turned to programs they turned to their own logic and reason and what did they do they put God completely out amen and then what happened after that fourth Church age God came in the fifth Church age and he said the just shall live by faith through a man called Martin Luther then he came to John Wesley he says you need to live a clean life you need to live a Sanctified life and then he came through the Pentecostal church and He restored the gifts and it was God building back to that original church but it didn't stop at Pentecost because they had the gifts but the giver was coming behind it amen they needed the fullness of the word and you can't have the fullness of the spirit without the fullness of the word that's what Peter brought was an open word amen and we know that that that that that's the way that God has been working is that we don't see the fullness until the very end we see a a sheath offering didn't we we saw a Prophet come and he showed us what an adopted son of God looks like but we're all being changed bit by bit into that very same thing whether you're a man whether you're a woman if you're a child of God you're coming to a place where he can use you like that but I want you to watch how opened it up because we know for the first while the disciples stayed in Jerusalem and they preached to the Jews and they faced lots of persecution and threats and Peter almost lost his head and an angel came and took him out of the jail but we saw in Acts 2:47 it says that the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved God added I can't add you can't add it takes God to do it amen but who was added those who respond responded to the preaching of the word there were those that responded to the gifts those that responded to the Miracles but it was those that responded to the word that were saved we see Simon the Sorcerer remember he looks and he sees them laying hands on people and they're getting the Holy Spirit and he says teach me how to do that I'll pay whatever it takes guess what Simon didn't become a part of the church CU he wasn't responding to the word he was responding to the authority he wanted to have power he wanted to have image he wanted want to have something he could leverage for his own gain that's not who God's adding in but we come to acts chap 10 and it's the story of of the House of Cornelius and how they're saved and I want to use this as an example tonight I'm teaching I know as I go through this and and some may know it but I want it I want it to be clear tonight how we get it and who it's for and how God does these things and in Acts 10 we read that there was a certain man in cesaria named Cornelius a centurion of the band called The Italian so he's a gentile he's not a Jew but the scripture says he was a devout man and one that feared God doesn't didn't say feared a god feared God he says with all of his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God always so Cornelius was a Jewish convert he was a convert convert to Judaism he served as well as he knew amen he worshiped the one true God he was a kind man he was a prayerful man amen but he didn't know the Full Gospel but he lived it as best that he could he was sincere in what he did it says and he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming into him and saying unto him Cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine arms are come up for a memorial before God see Cornelius wasn't just a talker Cornelius was not just a church attendee Cornelius prayed in his own prayer clock it Cornelius had his real walk with God Cornelius lived what he believed he didn't have a public life and then a private life that was different he was a sincere devout man amen what you saw out there was what you saw in here God says that's what I saw he's coming to sincerity but listen sincerity isn't going to be enough lots of sincere people there but they're only sincere as far as their religion will let them be but God's looking for people that will receive the word as it's revealed to them he says and now send men to japa and call for one Simon whose surname is Peter he lodge with one Simon a t Tanner whose house is by the seaside he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do so Cornelius has been living a good life he's been living according to the the word as it's been revealed to him but God comes to Cornelius he says Cornelius there's more for you to live there's more for you to do there's more for you to believe you've done well I'm commending you for it and because you've done well I'm going to bring you into the rest of it he says send for a man he'll tell you how to live now watch this because God's working on the other side so often we think that we're pulling or we're pushing and what it is is God's working on both ends to bring things together I can't tell how you how many times it's happened in a service in Fellowship you just get a an unction to go talk to somebody about something even at work bring something up and what happens is somebody responds quickly to it and what is it it's God working on both ends to bring something to pass amen it's a beautiful thing when God starts moving and it's not me that's that's trying to make something happen he always prepares the way you'll find he says and when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to japa now on the tomorrow as they went on their journey and Drew nigh into the city Peter went up onto the Housetop to pray about the hour and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance so Watch What Happens now Peter wants to eat and God puts him into a vision about eating instead and he saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon him as it had been a great sheet knit at the Four Corners and let down to the Earth and wherein were all manners of four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and and fouls of the air so You' got to realize that for the Jew there's only certain certain food that certain animals they could eat and what's coming down now is a sheet full of animals that he's not allowed to touch he's not allowed to touch he's not allowed to eat for sure so this is a horrifying thing for Peter this would be a nightmare for us because all of these are unclean animals and he's avoided these all his life and now God's bringing down something that he's avoided all his life and it's a move of God Watch What Happens now it says and there came a voice to him saying rise Peter kill and eat so this is contrary to Moses law now remember Peter knows this is contrary to moses' law but Peter is no longer under the law but Peter still has the condition of the law because he's been raised that way it's like brother visho when he came to us he tried the hamburgers and he tried the chicken and guess what he tried it for a while but guess what that old legalistic Jan nature was embedded in his DNA and he can enjoy it no matter how much we tell him how good it is it's not wrong is it it's not wrong to eat it it's not wrong not to eat it it's just how he's been raised and Peter's been raised and though he's had a new birth and the law has now been fulfilled he doesn't have to do these things it's still an abhorrence to him he wants nothing to do with it and Peter said not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean and the voice spake unto him again the second time what God had cleansed that call not thou calm and he says ' don't call it polluted if I tell you it's clean it's clean he says this was done Thrice it was done three times and then the vessel was received up into heaven God made sure that Peter got the gist of what was being said it didn't just come once and then disappear God repeated it three times so that Peter would have no doubts about what he was saying but watch now now while Peter doubted in himself what this Vision which he had seen should mean he doesn't know what it means he knows what it was but he doesn't know what God means by it behold the men that were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house and stood before the gate so this is God now orchestrating things as soon as he's got Peter ready to go then those men are at the door God's working on both ends it says and they called and asked whether Simon which was Sur named Peter were lodged there while Peter thought on the vision Peter's trying to figure out what's going on the spirit said unto him behold three men seek theee arise therefore get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for I have sent thee so these men are asking but God is sending Peter wouldn't go with three Gentiles came to his door but the spirit now moving on Peter is getting him to do something he would never have done before he says then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius and said behold I'm he whom you seek what is the cause wherefore you come what do you want and they said Cornelius the Centurion a just man and one that fearth God and of good report among all the nations of the Jews was warned from God by a Holy Angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee so we know what happens Peter says all right I've been told to go I'll go he walks all day with them and he walks back to cesaria and as soon as he walks down Watch What Happens it says and as Peter was coming in Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also am a man and as he talked with him he went in and he found many that were come together now you have to realize that for a Jew to be in the home of a gentile made them ceremonially unclean to touch a gentile made them ceremonial unclean and it separated them from the temple they had to go out they had to spend a certain amount of time they had to wash and only then could they come into the presence of God so p is now in a condition where under the law he cannot approach God he can't be in a house of worship he can't go hear the word in the synagogue he can't be with Saints of like Precious Faith he is in a precarious position according to the law and yet he's there and he said unto them you know how that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew to go to keep company or come unto one of another Nation he says you know what you're asking me to do Cornelius you know for sure because you know what our law teaches you you're converted to it he says but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean see God's not just working on Cornelius God's working on Peter because Peter's the one with the keys to the kingdom and so God's got to get him to go where Peter doesn't want to go amen sometimes we got to get a bit dirty with our gospel I don't mean that we go on Satan's territory I'm saying we've got to be able to get uncomfortable with the people we're dealing with listen not everybody that comes to God is going to come in dress right acting right talking right looking right that ain't the way they're coming in we've been lucky so far brother vichel but guess what they may be cursing they may be in our church and let something slip sometimes and you know what we're supposed to do Church look past it cuz why it's God that's got to clean them up not our not our righteous indignation not the fact that we're clean that won't clean them up them being convicted of it won't do it it's going to take a working of the Holy Spirit to change their lives amen Peter's saying I'm not supposed to be here you know I'm not allowed here by the law he says but God told me not to call you unclean and if you're not unclean I can't treat you like you're unclean I've got to give you the same opportunity I give anywhere else amen what was God doing he was undoing Peter's legalism now he was undoing the traditions of man amen God had to change Peter before he could change Cornelius can we receive that message this evening sometimes he's got to change me before he can help me change you sometimes he's got to teach me a lesson so that I can teach you the lesson amen we can't hold ourselves away from the working of the word we've got to let him do the work in us before we can help somebody else sometimes the change that's needed is not in them as much as it it's in us if we're ever going to be effective in the kingdom of God so he says God show me don't call you polluted don't call you unclean therefore came I unto you without gain saying that word without that phrase without gains saying means without objection in other words he obeyed willingly in his heart or in his flesh maybe we'd say he didn't want to go that's not where he was comfortable but God didn't have to whip Peter down the road he gave him a a vision to show him what was going to happen then he confirmed what he wanted him to do and Peter obeyed willingly he says as soon as I was sent for he says I asked therefore what intent youve sent for me he says I've obeyed the spirit I've done exactly what he said now tell me what you want and Cornelius then tells him of his own Vision how that God told him that Peter would tell him what was necessary for life and so Peter launches into this sweet little sermon it's only I think eight or 10 eight or 10 lines we would say but Cornelius has accepted the old Covenant but because he's a sincere believer God sends him the New Covenant because he's living by the word that he has God brings the word to see what he'll do with that God knows what he's going to do with it church he knows his own amen but it's so beautiful what happens here and it emphasizes why we believe as we do about how you get the Holy Spirit and how it comes and watch this because this is Peter speaking now he's giving the revealed word he's giving the New Covenant and it says and he commanded us he's speaking of Christ to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and dead to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins see Cornelius would have had to try to cover his sins he couldn't go all the way in as a gentile he could only have most be in the outer Court he's saying here's a way for you to get where we were but it'll be a completely different situation cuz we have to go in day after day this will do the work in one shot he's saying if you believe on this man on this this son of God that we're preaching if you accept him if you believe the words I'm telling you he'll forgive you of your sins he'll change your life and the scripture says while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word church what brought the Holy Ghost the preaching of the revealed word that's it now listen it can start with John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life that's really what Peter preached right there because that was the revealed word for the age so don't put somebody down cuz they're preaching just John 3:16 if you'll accept that God will take you into acts 238 and it'll take you into water baptism and it'll take you into the baptism of the Holy Ghost but as he spoke these words the Holy Spirit fell why because the revealed word was being preached Paul would say in Corinthians he says for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God he says it pleased God by one thing the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe this is why I do it I don't think this is the best way I'm not saying I don't believe that I'm saying there could be better Ways by intellect by by human reasoning we could we could do something uh that that that uh subliminally affects you or something like that we could do TV ads we could do all sorts of things but God says listen like it or lump it it's the foolishness of preaching that's going to do the job it's the foolishness of preaching that's going to convert Souls amen and while Peter preached the Holy Spirit fell on those people and in a moment sealed their souls to Eternity while Peter's preaching the word people were filled while people's preaching the word people were truly saved they didn't have an altar call he didn't make some big pull they didn't have a big shouting event beforehand they didn't make a scene but while Peter preached the Holy Spirit fell on them listen I'm okay with alter calls I'm okay with inviting people up we do it from time to time but it doesn't have to happen that way all that has to happen is as the word is coming you say that's for me Lord I'll take it the way you give it listen the world would say today what Peter was laying down they were picking up as the word was coming there their heart was saying I'll take it that's for me and they responding the Deep to the Deep to that word that's going and their heart is in a condition and God's standing there I can just see it in my head this evening I sometimes I think God's like a big kid and forgive me if that sounds sacrilegious but he's sitting there and he's looking for the opportunity to fulfill his word God's just looking for the chance and if that door just cracks open and just a little bit the big boot of the Holy Spirit comes in he says I'll give you my promise I'll give you my word I'll give you my spirit just give me a chance just give me a chance and you take him at one word and he'll fulfill it and then he'll give you another word and then he'll fulfill it and one after the other after the other God just wants to give it to you so much but you've got to open that door and while he's preaching Cornelius and his household devout people sincere believer Bel they said I'll accept that and as they did it their heart condition was right and God gave them the holy spirit amen God's just aching to do these things brother Braham says it this way he says be determined don't be defeated you can't be defeated you're children of God God promised the Holy Spirit to every believer he wants to give it to you tonight more than you want to receive it more than you want to receive it the desire of God is so great to have his children restored into fellowship and there's only one way we get there and it's by the Holy Spirit he says now don't tell them how you want to get it tell them you want it no matter how it comes you want it you want something to Anchor your heart and soul away till all doubts and fears will pass away and joy bells of heaven will ring through your soul he says God will take care of the rest of it see we don't come in and say God take care of everything say God give me an anchor for my soul give me something that assures me that I've been changed from I pass from Death unto life he says God will take care of the rest of it you just ask him to give you the baptism of the Holy Spirit such a beautiful picture Church sitting there maybe like we are tonight in a living room somewhere in in an open courtyard or something like that and while the word is being preached God comes down and he seals their soul to Eternity amen Peter talking about the promises of God later in one of his books he writes this and this I believe is our message here this is for us today and he says knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust are we there church he says it's the last days this was not for them that's for this is for us this is our scripture he says and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation see as the apostles died as Paul died as Peter died as all of them died the signs and wonders died with them in most cases they say where is God where is his coming see it was all just a farce it was just for that day there's no reality to it and they start to make fun of it and they start to live a life according to their desires CU they don't believe what God said they see how long been they see how long we've been preaching there's a Resurrection coming there's a Rapture coming there's a bride that's going to have a body change and because it hasn't happen they get cocky we've seen it with these people that criticize this message they're awfully cocky but notice what Peter says for this they are will they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water they're saying he's saying the very thing that they're living on God created it he says whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished it took 120 years for God to destroy the Earth the way he promised and I'd imagine in year 119 they were pretty cocky Noah what are you doing Noah You' spent all this time preparing this place preparing this Ark preaching the same stupid message and nothing's happened Noah look around we've had a great time and you've lost so much time to this belief you have but in year 120 nobody was criticizing them anymore were they he says it's the same thing today but watch he says but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men God's not going to be mocked there's judgment coming he says but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day we've preached on this time means nothing to God but verse 9 is where I want to go he says the Lord is not slack concerning his promise you look at what brother brandham said this bride would be how much do we have today if we're honest of the Fulfillment exactly the way he preached it how much do we have half maybe 2/3 maybe do we have it all I don't believe so but the words there but the reality may not be here yet we know there's a quick short work coming we know that there's a a 30 to 40 days that's coming we know there's a Resurrection coming we know God's got it mapped out in a particular timeline so that doesn't worry us but he says God is Not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness he says see people say he's slack because it's taking so long but don't judge God according to man's condition or man's standard ards he says but he is longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance notice he's not longsuffering to the world he's longsuffering to you and I he's longsuffering to his children cuz he's not willing that they should perish listen the whole world is going to perish this is not who he's talking about he's talking about his children and this is a reflection of what he said to them that are a far off to them that aren't where they supposed to be to them that are on the path but not there yet he says it's his longsuffering that's holding it back so you can get into position so you can come into maturity so you can come into what God has promised he would do in this age he's saying I'm not going to let any one of them slip Jesus said I won't lose a one that you've given me Peter's warning us he says hard times are coming it's going to seem like nothing's happening it seems like the world is winning the word is losing people are going to dismiss the preaching of the word people are going to dismiss the promise of the hour but verse 9 is meant for us it says God's not slack God's not going to leave one word unfulfilled and his word was given to you and I so there's a promise for each and every us us he's not willing that we should perish how do you perish Church be separated from God that's what perish means it's not the loss of this Breath of Life it's to be separated from God he's not willing that any of us would be separated from him so what's his promise his promise is to those that are far off I'm going to give them my spirit I'm going to go out and I'm going to grab them some I might have to grab by the Scruff of the neck and some of them I might just have to give them a hug of love for once but whatever it takes from either of those extremes I'll bring them in amen he's not going to back down he wants every one of us to come to a place of repentance because that'll lead us to the holy spirit amen Watch What Happens now the Holy Spirit Falls is Peter's preaching it says in they of the circumcision see some Jews came with Peter sometimes the thing that's needed is for us to get out our tradition so that other people will we got a lot of traditions I'm speaking generally not specifically sometimes we need to stop and say you know what that's all it is is a tradition cuz when Peter went everybody else had what they had freedom to follow cuz he's got the keys to the kingdom he's being led of the Holy Spirit and they're trusting him and so the Jews are in there in the house with Peter they're ceremonially unclean because Peter was led by the spirit to get out of his legalism amen it says and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed they him to T certain days now watch how the prophet of God lays us out it's such a beautiful picture here he says Cornelius he was a great man an honorable man he built churches he respected the Jews because he knew their religion was right he paid alms he prayed every day but when the Holy Ghost came now watch what he puts here he says something had been added to the church he needed a guide God sent him the Holy Ghost he sent it in the person of Peter see church sometimes we're Hing we're asking God to come down and know what God's trying to do is send him the Holy Ghost in person a portion but while we gets a portion anyways watch how he lays this out he says he sent it in the person of Peter for while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them God used the guide through Peter he used it because he guided Cornelius to the right way remember Peter didn't go of his own of his own desire but he went by the leading of the spirit amen when we do what the spirit tells us that's when it's effective not when I come up with an idea of program a a missions program or Outreach but when God would show me what to do as he did Peter that's when it's effective it says and while he was yet speaking the Holy Ghost fell on them Gentiles then he said can a man forbid water that these should not be baptized see it's still the God speaking not Peter because that was a bunch of Gentiles unclean dirty to him and he didn't even want to go but the guide said I'm sending you you do things you don't think you would do when the guide gets complete control when you let him guide you see everybody's got to grow under the anointing of the Holy Spirit he says oh how wonderful it is to be led by the Holy Spirit he is the guide he spoke through Peter and told him what he must do then when they all received the Holy Ghost he said we can't forbid water seeing these have received CE the Holy Ghost like we did at the beginning and they baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus now who led him to do that he says the guide that was in him didn't Jesus tell them take no thought what you're going to say because it's not you that's speaking it's the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the speaking when you're LED go when you're asked to talk talk when you asked to be quiet be quiet too amen we've got to be sensitive to those things brother BR would continue in another message he says that's the Apostolic Church moving in the spirit wherever God said Peter went down to follow the lord he says and if a man if God could ever get a man and woman today in this Tabernacle anywhere else that'll pay no attention to what's going on around them but submit themselves to the Lord as an individual unit he says God will lead the same man today that he led then as an individual unit now God's not the author of chaos and he's not the author of division so he's not going to lead two people to get into a headbutting contest but if God leads you to do something you do it amen I'm not here to lead you I'm here to point you to the word so the Holy Spirit can lead you he says he proves that he's with us watch this what we need today is a humble submitted life submit yourself don't squeeze yourself back don't do nothing but lead straight with the Holy Spirit and what the spirit says do do quickly don't say well I'll wait and find out what this is and that is he says what the holy spirit says do go do it why because souls are relying on our obedience God's trying to use us for a purpose amen we need to be quick to hear and quick to obey and one thing's for sure you got to know your Bible to know who's talking to you too many people are being led by the spirit and they're contrary to the word and it's not the spirit leading them but it feels real good and it usually benefits them rather than others he says obedience is better than sacrifice do what the holy spirit says do he says what we need tonight is to let loose of all our little squeezy ideas and let the Holy Spirit lead he says you're taught here you know what's right and wrong but what you need tonight is a great big bundle full of the love of God poured out in your heart and all differences washed away he says bury it with the old year as it passes out let it go let's start a new life A New Beginning he says if you're already born in the kingdom of God you've already got the holy spirit in you the only thing you have to do see this isn't the end you get the Holy Spirit that's the start church that's the real start he says the only thing you have to do is cut loose from those things of the world that's holding you down he said let us lay aside every wait and the sin that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the life the race that set before us he said lay aside the race lay aside the weights so we see here that the spirit can come to a person at any time it can happen after repentance and baptism it can happen before water baptism it can happen without a person realizing it now you say how is that possible Brother John it can happen and you'll know something's changed but you won't realize what's actually happened absolutely absolutely you can have a changed life you can have a changed mind you can have changed desires you can literally become subject to the word and not realize that it's the baptism of the holy spirit that did it why because you haven't been taught you don't know what's going on all you know is I'm not the way I used to be but you still got it you still got it we're going to talk about this in a little bit but this is the sovereignty of God and I think he did it for people just like me cuz us Germans we like a law and we like a formula and we like it to be done the same way every time and you know what God says he says I'm going to do it my way I'm going to be Sovereign I'm going to be God I'm not going to raise my hand he says I'm going to be God and you can be you and he says I'll give it when I see it's the right time and it's up to him to see it because God's looking at the heart and that's one thing I can't see I can see what comes out of it and I can interpret that and I can put some discernment behind it but in the end I don't know what's in your heart God does and that's what happened amen that's what happened on the day of on this day at at Cornelius house is they're receiving the word and God says their heart's right their heart is receiving it that's all I need to do and he drops down and he fills him with the spirit amen but there's one thing that I know it may not come the same way to every person it may not come in the same order of events but one thing's for sure it'll always come the same way and it'll have the same effect it'll come by the word the holy spirit always comes by the word and it'll change your life amen it'll have the same effect it'll produce the fruit of the spirit how does the Holy Spirit Come it comes with the word a portion and it sees what you'll do with it and if you'll accept that then it'll give you the next and the next and the next and he says they're receiving the word and what does he do it's an act of your faith and he comes behind and he seals it with the spirit it's his acceptance of Your Action it's his acceptance of your reaction to the word of God Amen you accept it you live it you rest on it you obey it and God comes behind it and he seals it with his Spirit watch what brother brandham says about this he says now while he yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell then Peter said can we forbid water seeing that these received the Holy Ghost like we did he said I believe their sins were already gone for the Holy Spirit would have not come in and he would not have come in unless had been a predestinated vessel he knew that they would follow follow what the word baptism is just an outward expression of an inward event so God doesn't need us to be baptized with water what he needs is our life to die out and when that's died out then he can come in amen and he can forgive our sins what happens when we're baptized is what we've received the word we've subjected ourselves to it and in obedience we just go or baptized but really we've already been quickened our life has been changed hopefully by those things the heart has already been changed and you're agree in agreement with the word and you've been cleansed of your sins so God could come in and dwell in you they still had to be baptized properly brother Braham says why because the word requires it and the Order of events doesn't matter you'll still obey the word of God no matter what but they were saying ien to the word maybe not so much with their mouth but their hearts were saying it and as soon as that heart was cleansed God could come in and dwell in it brother brandom says their sins were gone that's why the spirit could come in why because they were children of God receiving the word of God that's all that was happening there amen they had walked as far as they could in the light of God and then God sent them further light and that further light was to receive his very life and as soon as they receiv received the word that said it was possible they receiv received the promise of it as well amen that's the word it came by way of man but what changed them was not Peter what changed them was the Holy Spirit through the word too often we're focused on this guy we're focused on men we're focused on Ministry amen listen what we bring may be lifechanging but we are not lifechanging we need our lives change we come we go we rise we fall and it's the only the holy spirit that can anoint us and if we can surrender to that anointing that's what makes us effective I've sat in services in this church in our old little church in brother Gerald in the in the small congregation and churches we've had there I've been in churches all around the globe and had the Holy Spirit pin me to my seat sometimes in good ways and sometimes in bad ways and guess what it was was not the man I knew it wasn't the man cuz the man didn't know but the Holy Spirit came through that word and changed my life in so many ways gave me direction gave me leadership gave me correction set me straight corrected my attitude whatever the need was there amen I'm not receiving the man I'm receiving the word coming through the man we've got to be able to separate those things I've seen what happens again even in this church when people take that that what's coming over the pulpit and they say well that's just the man he knows somebody told about me no no no ain't nobody talking it's the Holy Spirit and you got to receive it that way God helped me to keep myself out of those things amen but when the Holy Spirit comes to reject it you know what happens is you end up falling away if only in that little area of your life because you won't be corrected we've got to receive it as the Holy Spirit speaks amen like I said God helped me not to get involved in those things but BR says this he says come back to God and his Bible come back to the gospel truth let some organization wrap you away from the things of God he says don't you never do that you come to God back to God's simple way just fall on your knees and say Lord God I don't care what or how you give it to me but I'm here for it he says Watch What Happens and be sincere about it he's more anxious to give it to you than you are to receive it you don't have to T and T and T there's no such a thing he says while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard it right he says the trouble of it is we don't want it enough we don't want to Humble theirselves that's a hard thing to say we don't want to Humble ourselves I remember my own self before I gave my heart to the Lord The Humbling came from one I don't like to be corrected and listen you can't come to God unless you can be corrected that's what repentance is is accepting correction but two I didn't want to be responsible for what I had to know you don't because as soon as you know the truth and you say I'm going to commit my life to Christ now you're held accountable for it and guess what scripture says it's the sons that he chastises and if you've heard enough of brother Gerald's preaching you know that he preached chastisement plenty of times and so you knew what's coming if I don't live it then I'm going to get beat up I'm going to get a spank and I'm going to get a whip and I'm going to get put in my place and I didn't like to humble myself to that idea I wanted to do my thing but guess what like I said before I was miserable anyways might as well be miserable in the right way than in the wrong way it's not why I gave my heart to the Lord but listen Satan will run circles around us with his logic that's for sure he says we don't want to Humble ourselves I want to close with this one story I know many of you have heard it I don't think maybe the young people have and I've taken this and if you'll forgive me I've combined some of the it's all from the same same message and same quotes but I've kind of cleaned it up a bit to make it easier to read and to shorten it cuz it is a little bit of time but we'll close on this thought but brother Adam's talking about this man that spent years trying to get saved and he kept trying and he kept trying and what do we mean by get saved receive the Holy Spirit the world will talk about salvation all these different things but when we talk about saved we mean receive eternal life receive the holy spirit amen so this man had a wife that went down to a Pentecostal meeting and she received the Holy Spirit and in a meeting there and he was trying to get the Holy Spirit as well and he just couldn't seem to do it he said no matter where he went or what he listened to and so he came to brother Bram for help figuring that brother Bram could sort it out he says people say you're a prophet maybe you can help me so listen to this he says look I went to all of Billy I went to Billy graes meetings a great famous preacher brother Bram says he's a wonderful man of God doing a great work for God and he said I went to his meetings and he told all that wants to be saved raise up your hands I raised my hand up and went into an inquiry room then they told me back there I had to accept Jesus I got down and prayed he told me now do you believe in Jesus Christ they said yes I accept him as personal savior he said now you're saved and he said nothing happened to me young people how many times you've gone to camp and somebody said do this and do that and do this and do that you'll know when you're changed you'll know when you're changed you won't have to take somebody word for it he knew he hadn't changed he knew he hadn't changed he said nothing happened to me he said I went them for a couple of years and I found the Free Methodist people who said I had to get happy enough to shout they prayed over me and everything till I got happy enough to shout they said now you got it you got sanctification I went out and said I was searching for all I could I still didn't have it see you got to be convinced in your own self ain't nobody going to going to going to resolve your questions it's got to be a a personal revelation to you he said then I went to Brother o Robert's meetings Church he's going to all the great Ministries he's going to all the great churches he's going to the ones that have the most signs and wonder he's going all over the place he's going anywhere he thinks there's a hope or a chance don't think people aren't doing it today within this message I'm going to go to this brother's church because they get results I'm going to go to church listen you got to accept the word you've been given God will do the work the man's not going to do the work you got to you got to let the word do the work he said I went to Brother o Robert's meetings they went into the room and told me I had to receive the Holy Ghost and I had to speak with tongues or I didn't have it he says I went back and there and they prayed over me and told me to talk to the Lord I spoke with tongues he said I still ain't got it he said and I don't know what to do Church Revival after Revival camp meeting after camp meeting church after church ministry after Ministry and he says I still ain't got what I'm looking for the frustration sometimes that people go through and sometimes it's our fault that we put our kids through this I'll speak to that specifically we put them through it and we put them through it and we put them through it church let God do the work let him speak listen we've had people receive the Holy Ghost here and we've had people go away and receive the Holy Ghost we've had people that had to leave to get the Holy Ghost there we've had people that had to stay to get the Holy Ghost listen God will work through an anointed man doesn't matter what people think about the man if God has chosen him and God has placed him God will use him and God will bring what's needed in the church now listen to what brother brandham says he says my brother the only thing is you're just confused said I want to ask you something did you always love the Lord Jesus he said well I belong to the Presbyterian church but I just went there and Bam said well I want to ask you what happened and what took place that you changed your mind all at once what's better abam saying he's saying what's driving this in the first place why do you keep trying to get saved why do you keep going to church why do you keep going to camp meetings why do you keep trying all these different things under different Ministries and he said well my wife she went down to the Pentecostals and she got the spirit and so then she came back up and she was happy brother Braham said well what do you think about that did you criticize it he said no he said I just thought well I'll see how it lasts and it went on she seemed to have it he said one day I was coming coming in from making a sale out in the yard and I happened to reach in my pocket and somebody had given me a little old tract I sat down in the office and began to read this tract and the awfulest feeling came over me does anybody remember that awfulest feeling you'll never forget it it's called conviction and it is absolutely awful but it's awful with a purpose as opposed to condemnation he says the awfulest feeling came over me that I ought to get right with God he said I've been searching ever since brother BR says I I want to ask you something he said when this feeling come over you you've never been able to get out of it he said no sir I haven't he said I said well that's when you receiv received Christ I said it doesn't mean raising up your hands that's all right speaking in tongues that's all right shouting that's all right he says but that's the attribute of Christ after he comes in I said to receive Christ is to receive the person in Christ Jesus to receive him as life shouting speaking in tongues and all demonstrations those are all attributes that follow this he says but first is to receive Christ he's trying to let the brother see what was going on in the whole time he says then he said then brother Bram I've been saved all this time I said sure look do you love him he said with all my heart he said one time you didn't love him he said that's right and now you love him he said well that's the truth I said well you had him all the time and he jumped off the porch and began crying and holding me in his arms and he said oh god I've been a Christian all these years what's he been doing all along Church he's been seeking to get right with God he's been obeying the word as it came to him he's been doing what the people told him to do amen but what happened is he he received the word from that little tract and when he received that word he was quick to life amen he was living a life that loved Christ he was living a Sanctified life he was living a clean life he was going to church he was doing everything a Christian does and seeking to be a Christian and didn't know what had already happened that's why I said you can get it without realizing what's happened doesn't mean it didn't happen but he had he had no clue that what had gone on in his life watch what brother BR says he says well his thoughts changed something did it for him Hallelujah as a man thinketh in his heart see Christ the Creator came to him in a still form and created his own Spirit took the man's nature away to love dancing and the world and carrying on and from that time he just laid it aside and was hungering for after God and God was in him all the time he says it was God in the beginning it was God all along that was drawing him to to this and he had no clue what was going on and he was under conviction why cuz he didn't meet somebody else's experience somebody else's requirement he said as a man thinketh it has to become a thought before it be can become a word and a word expressed materializes I believe in my heart that I'm a Christian because I have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ if I don't cry if I don't move if I don't do a thing don't build up what your experience with Christ is going to be don't decide what it's going to be before it's there let him do it he says in my heart first I believe that Christ died for me in my stad amen I accept it as a Christian I believe it as a Christian then it's in my heart then I express it in a word I am a Christian Hallelujah he says then I start walking as a Christian talking as a Christian Living as a Christian being as a Christian and by my fruits I'm recognized ized by the World As a Christian see we're not here to seek an experience by somebody else's standards amen somebody else's expectations the way it worked for somebody else is not the way it might work for us we can't go around that poor man was chasing for years something he already had why because he was listening to other people and looking at the boxes they had created rather than looking at what the word said about him people were trying to fit his experience with God into their box and because it didn't fit it said you must fit it into our box or you don't have it they drove him crazy the New Birth the the receiving of the holy spirit is not defined by my experience or yours it's defined by the word that's it and it's the results we're looking for not the events that lead up to it he can come any way he wants he can come through anybody he wants you can be walking down the street meditating on something you heard in church and God can give you the Holy Spirit or you can be in church and you can you can respond to a to the to the calling of God and come up and yes go to the Altar and and give your heart to God and God can fill you with his Spirit it could be after you're baptized it can be before it can be as a 9-year-old and it could be as a 90-year old brother B talks about that old lady sorry he saw he was beyond the curtain of time remember and this young woman came up to him and she said oh brother brandom she says don't you recognize me and he says no and she said you prayed for me and I and uh I received the Lord and she was over 90 years old listen don't put a timeline on it but brother Bram says listen tell them you want it just tell them you want it however it comes whenever it comes by whichever Ministry which by ever word by whichever service by whatever moment whatever it is let him know you want it and then he said stay there and say I'm not leaving until I get it yes we got to go to work yes we got to go go to school yes we've got to live this life and these things but don't leave the promise until he gives it to you amen you know we talk about sending our kids away and hoping they'll have an experience too often what we get are a camp experience not a Christ experience why because emotions are running High hey the holy spirit's there I'm not saying it's not but under that atmosphere lots of things happen but that doesn't mean you've met Christ you've been in his presence you've seen what the Holy Spirit can do but it's the changeed life we're looking for because otherwise what are we doing we're running them from Camp to Camp from revival to Revival and unless the service goes a certain way unless the worships a certain way unless the preachers a certain way then what do they do they lose their experience because their experience was bound in the box of camp it was bound in the box of so- and so's church it was bound in the box of what so and so told them no take it back back to the word and say Lord I want an experience that matches your word Above All Else amen amen let's stand if we would listen a lot of people today are seeking an experience of their own definition God took Peter's definition and he kicked it out the door he said Peter I'm going to grow you and then I'm going to go bring some other people to life once you can get out of this little rut you're in once you can get out of this old way and this old tradition of doing things amen sent him to Cornelius the Holy Spirit fell even while he spoke sent him to Samaria to the people that were half in and half out that didn't know how to worship God and gave them the Holy Spirit then he takes Paul and he turns him to the entire Gentile world and he brings out a people that he would call beloved that had never been called beloved before amen we need to see it's God who decides it's not me it's not you it's God that's got to put the call in their life and he's got to come to them personally and individually amen I don't want a camp experience I don't want my kids to have a camp experience I want them to have a living personal relationship with Jesus Christ you know what we need to do Church fall in love with Jesus fall in love with Jesus you fall in love with him everything else will go into its perfect place because we're going to have ups and downs in life we're going to have ups and downs in church we going to have ups and downs in our marriages and our jobs and school and all these things but he's the one thing that never changes and when you you are satisfied that you've met him and that he's met you that he's come in and live with you remember the scripture says they came to they'll come to at the end of the day and they'll say well we did this and we did that and he says I never knew you listen I've met a lot of famous people but they don't know me I know them but they don't know me the new birth is when he comes down and says I know you I know who you are cuz you're my child your name's written it's not just written on the Lamb's Book of Life it's written in the p Palms in my hands and I can't lose a one of you and I'm here to let you know you're a child of God Amen that's what'll settle us I have never forgotten when God called me his child and he made it abundantly clear he was talking to me I'll never forget it nobody could ever take it away I said this before I talked to brother Barry coffee after those meetings were over and I told him what he said and he looked at me and he's like I don't remember ever saying that had nothing to do with what he was talking about but the voice that I heard was very specific to me and called me out Donnie Reagan the same thing what it's not Donnie Reagan it's not Barry coffee it's not Jonathan klette it's got to be the Holy Spirit wooing calling amen and he made it personal to me that I am a child of God that's why I stand here today that's why I come to church that's why I believe what I do is because he called my name personally and nobody can ever change that amen that's what we need God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how we need your presence in our lives Lord how we need a personal touch Lord not a church experience not a Wednesday night or a Sunday Morning Experience Lord but Lord we need a filling that stays with us that seals us that anchors us that assures us Lord God lord many of us have received your Spirit Lord and many of us haven't Lord I pray for our young people especially Lord God lord as Jesus said to Peter Satan has desired to sift them Lord to ring them out to blow them away on the Winds of this world Lord but you won't lose a one Lord I pray that you would reach down Lord that they would feel the call of your spirit Lord Lord Jesus that they recognize this isn't a game it's not a religion lord it's not just a church service Lord but it's the Holy Spirit calling them to you Lord I pray you put such a desire in their hearts Lord that it would burn within them Lord that awfulest feeling of how much they need you Lord and that they'd seek you and theyd do all that they can according to your word Lord to set Lord their life in a condition to receive you Lord not to fix it Lord but to open it so you can come in and fix it for them I pray Lord I pray you minister to us Lord over these days and weeks Lord
