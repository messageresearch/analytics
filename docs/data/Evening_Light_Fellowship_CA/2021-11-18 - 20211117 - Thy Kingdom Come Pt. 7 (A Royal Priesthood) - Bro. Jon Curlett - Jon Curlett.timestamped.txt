[37:11] marvelous light amen may god had the
[37:14] may god had the his blessing to the
[37:16] reading of his word
[37:18] man it's a it's been a long week amen
[37:21] and it's been a long time since i've
[37:22] preached it feels like you get used to
[37:24] kind of cruising along up here every
[37:26] week and all of a sudden you go away and
[37:28] you you don't know which which which
[37:29] one's the new testament which one's the
[37:31] old testament i think amen
[37:33] amen it has been some time since i
[37:35] preached and so
[37:36] god grant me grace this morning like i
[37:37] said my voice is a little out of it this
[37:39] this evening as well and just trusting
[37:41] that um
[37:43] trusting that he'll be with us amen
[37:45] amen we i thought we were done with the
[37:47] men when i last spoke and i was talking
[37:49] to some of the brothers outside and i
[37:51] said you know there's a couple things
[37:52] kind of that have just been lurking in
[37:53] the back of my mind and not sure what
[37:56] would happen with that so um the way it
[37:58] is is we're going to keep talking to the
[37:59] men for a little bit no but again as
[38:01] usual what we're talking about tonight
[38:02] is not just for the men it's very much a
[38:04] part of the sisters and we'll see that
[38:05] more as we start to to minister to them
[38:08] a little bit later amen but tonight i
[38:09] want to take a a title of a royal
[38:13] priesthood amen and when we start
[38:15] talking about priesthood we
[38:16] automatically start thinking about men
[38:18] but when we look at this royal
[38:19] priesthood we'll say it's not exclusive
[38:20] to men but certainly if the men don't
[38:22] have it then we're going to see a very
[38:24] big struggle with the woman amen amen
[38:27] and last two services we spoke on if you
[38:29] remember the jehovah gyra attribute of
[38:30] god and how that needs to come into the
[38:32] man and he has to take seriously that
[38:34] that that provision for his family for
[38:36] the local body for the ones that are
[38:38] around the needy and these different
[38:39] things like that and then we see that
[38:41] every man no matter how great he is no
[38:43] matter how gifted he is no matter how
[38:45] strong he is no matter how intelligent
[38:46] he is or how educated he is he gets to a
[38:49] place if he's a real believer and he
[38:51] says lord i don't have what i need amen
[38:53] i've come to a situation i've come to a
[38:55] realization that what you're looking for
[38:57] in this situation i don't have amen i
[38:59] don't have the intelligence i might have
[39:01] some thoughts i might have some ideas i
[39:03] might have some inclinations but lord i
[39:05] don't have a clear vision i don't have a
[39:06] clear idea i don't have a clear
[39:08] understanding of what it is that's
[39:10] required in this situation and so lord
[39:12] i'm asking you to come into my situation
[39:14] and i'm coming to you and as james said
[39:16] i'm going to ask you for wisdom on how
[39:18] to deal with the things that are going
[39:19] on in my life amen and it can range all
[39:22] the way from the most carnal things of
[39:23] of you know where do i live and what
[39:25] house do i buy and what car do i buy all
[39:27] the way up to where do i attend church
[39:29] what ministry do i support where do i
[39:30] pay my tithes you know what kind of
[39:32] hobbies do i have how do i raise my kids
[39:34] how do i discipline my kids what wife
[39:37] should i should i marry you know what
[39:38] husband should i marry for the women of
[39:40] these different things like that amen
[39:42] but we had to recognize in those
[39:44] situations that we do all things through
[39:46] christ who strengthens us amen and when
[39:48] if we could come to that place of
[39:49] realizing that a lot sooner i think in
[39:51] situations we'd probably get through the
[39:53] the the things that we face in life a
[39:55] lot quicker because all he's looking for
[39:57] so often is for us to realize that we
[39:59] don't have what it takes outside of him
[40:01] and meant so often what he's doing is
[40:02] he's putting situations in our lives so
[40:04] that we'll realize that we've got to be
[40:06] reliant on him because he is the great
[40:08] husband he is the great provider he is
[40:09] the great bridegroom in our lives amen
[40:12] but so much of what we've been talking
[40:14] about i guess it's a bit ironic that
[40:16] we're in church and we're preaching and
[40:17] we've covered a lot of things about the
[40:18] physical we've talked about the you know
[40:20] the way the man has to be a provider and
[40:22] he has to be able to work and he has to
[40:23] take the responsibility of the family on
[40:25] his shoulders and these things but we
[40:27] know that that is not the the most
[40:29] important thing amen it does it's no
[40:31] good the scripture says what does it
[40:32] profit a man if he gain the whole world
[40:34] but lose his soul amen so if he makes
[40:36] all the money in the world if he
[40:37] provides a great home if he if he takes
[40:39] his family on good vacations they have
[40:41] all the clothes and food that they could
[40:42] ever imagine but if their souls are not
[40:44] taken care of then he still failed in
[40:46] his jehovah gyra attribute amen he has
[40:49] failed in that idea of being the head of
[40:51] the household that's supposed to provide
[40:52] all of those needs amen or facilitate it
[40:55] we know a man cannot do it a husband
[40:57] cannot provide every need for his wife
[40:59] or for his children amen but he is
[41:00] supposed to be under the authority of
[41:02] one that can provide all of those needs
[41:04] but he's supposed to be bringing us to
[41:06] the place where god can meet us amen
[41:08] he's supposed to be pointing the family
[41:09] in the direction of the word of god so
[41:11] that when they come into their needs
[41:13] then they know that he's not looking to
[41:15] himself but he's looking to god and he's
[41:16] looking to the word for those things
[41:18] amen what we want to get to is a place
[41:20] where we're living by divine decree amen
[41:22] where we're not living by our own
[41:24] thoughts we're not living by what the
[41:25] world tells us that we should do but
[41:27] we're living by the divine decree which
[41:28] is what it is the word of god amen
[41:31] brother steve and i were talking and we
[41:33] were talking about the simplicity of
[41:34] god's leadership and we were talking
[41:36] about you know some of the more
[41:36] supernatural things dreams and visions
[41:38] and that you know and and he was saying
[41:40] you know he said i'm so glad we have the
[41:42] word he says because most of what we
[41:44] need is right here in fact all of what
[41:46] we need is right here god never promised
[41:48] that you'd have to have a dream or a
[41:49] vision in your life but he did say i've
[41:51] given you a word that'll take you in a
[41:52] rapture amen and so so often what
[41:54] happens is we over spiritualize
[41:56] something and we're looking for
[41:57] something that's hidden in here in plain
[42:00] view if we'd only just get in there
[42:01] meditate on it and that's what brother
[42:02] steve was talking about was that need to
[42:04] meditate and dwell on the things of god
[42:06] and give god a chance to come in and
[42:07] speak to you and show you a direction in
[42:10] your life amen
[42:12] amen we talked last time about how in
[42:14] the the old testament the decree was be
[42:16] fruitful and multiply and then we see in
[42:18] mark 16 where it went from be fruitful
[42:20] and multiply physically and have lots of
[42:22] children and become a great nation he
[42:24] said now go you into all the world and
[42:25] preach the gospel amen and it was now
[42:27] about bringing in spiritual children not
[42:29] about bringing in physical children amen
[42:31] which was a great relief to fathers in
[42:33] this generation because you can't have
[42:35] children all the time and make it
[42:36] through and then it's too difficult to
[42:38] do it so now we have a commission to go
[42:40] in and get the the spiritual children
[42:42] get the spiritual seed of god that are
[42:44] in the earth and that's our great goal
[42:45] now is to bring forth spiritual seed not
[42:47] physical seed in our lives amen but we
[42:50] started with this scripture here in
[42:52] first peter 2 9 for a reason because we
[42:54] see here a beautiful picture of the role
[42:56] of the bride of christ i mean this is a
[42:58] beautiful picture of what her purpose is
[43:01] of what she is what it is that she has
[43:03] and then the effect of what she she uh
[43:06] of what comes out of her if she's found
[43:07] in this sort of thing you know and peter
[43:09] says but ye are a chosen generation a
[43:12] royal priesthood a holy nation and a
[43:15] peculiar people that you should show
[43:17] forth the praises of him who have called
[43:19] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[43:22] light so he's not talking to the jews
[43:24] here now peter's talking to the gentiles
[43:27] only these are people that are not jews
[43:28] they are not supposed to be a part of
[43:30] the priesthood amen this is a big
[43:32] picture of you like we talked about and
[43:34] he says the first thing we are is a
[43:36] chosen generation and then before you or
[43:38] anything else he says you're a chosen
[43:40] generation and we read this in ephesians
[43:42] when we were doing our series there and
[43:43] he said blessed be the god and father of
[43:46] our lord jesus christ who had blessed us
[43:48] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[43:51] places in christ amen what a place for
[43:53] the believer to be is that every
[43:54] spiritual blessing that god has is
[43:57] available to you there is nothing held
[43:59] back from the children that he has today
[44:01] there's nothing held back from the bride
[44:03] of this age but it says now in verse 4
[44:06] according as he had chosen us in him
[44:08] before the foundation of the world that
[44:11] we should be two things holy
[44:14] and without blame before him in love
[44:17] what what peter's saying here is he says
[44:19] you are chosen for a purpose and that
[44:21] purpose was to be holy and that purpose
[44:24] was to be blameless and it was under the
[44:26] umbrella of god's love amen it is always
[44:29] god's love that brings us to these
[44:30] things it is not our action it is not as
[44:32] our idea amen we did not choose god god
[44:35] chose us and because he chose us we
[44:37] could respond to him when he called us
[44:40] amen you had to have something inside of
[44:42] you david called it the deep color to
[44:44] the deep there had to be something
[44:45] inside of you to respond and that inside
[44:48] of you that responds is of god's
[44:49] choosing and then it was of god's
[44:51] placing it was of god's thinking in in
[44:53] before things were ever uh coming into
[44:55] creation before the world ever began
[44:57] amen it was god's choosing that brought
[44:59] us to this and it's grace that brings us
[45:01] to this place every single time and he
[45:03] said i won't lose a one
[45:05] jesus said all that you've given me i
[45:06] won't lose any of them amen so it's his
[45:08] choosing that brings us to a place of
[45:10] being holy and blameless amen so it's
[45:13] his whole his choosing that makes us
[45:15] holy amen we are not holy again because
[45:17] of our actions we sit here and we say
[45:19] i've got the holy ghost i've got the the
[45:21] message of the hour that is not wake
[45:23] what makes us holy amen it will never
[45:25] make you holy what makes you holy is
[45:27] that he took on your unrighteousness so
[45:29] that you could have his and he gave you
[45:31] his place when he took yours amen so our
[45:33] holiness is through the shed blood of
[45:35] christ and the holy spirit that is
[45:36] within us that gives us the very life
[45:39] that we're looking for amen
[45:40] and the thing that brings us there like
[45:42] i said is what it's his love it's his
[45:44] elective love it's his predestinated
[45:46] love that that elected us before the
[45:48] foundation of the world but then it's
[45:50] his sacrificial love that provides the
[45:52] blood that covers us and makes us holy
[45:55] amen that there is nothing that he can
[45:56] see he can't see anything we do as long
[45:58] as we're under that blood
[46:00] amen as long as we stay there as long as
[46:02] we apply that token to our lives he
[46:04] can't see our sin but it's been put in
[46:06] the sea of our in god's forgetfulness
[46:08] from the very beginning and we just have
[46:10] to keep on in our mind that we shouldn't
[46:12] be bringing it up amen once we put it
[46:14] under we don't bring it up we say lord
[46:16] i'm sorry i repent i'm putting it under
[46:19] the blood and then we don't bring it up
[46:20] again because when you bring it up again
[46:22] he doesn't remember it and he says what
[46:24] are you talking about my son what are
[46:25] you talking about my daughter amen it's
[46:27] in the sea of his forgetfulness and it's
[46:29] a supernatural thing that you're going
[46:31] against when you try and bring it up to
[46:33] him he can't remember and you're
[46:35] reminding a supernatural god of
[46:36] something that he knows nothing about if
[46:38] he can't remember it it doesn't exist so
[46:40] don't talk about it amen put it under
[46:41] the blood that's true justification is
[46:43] when you realize you didn't do it right
[46:46] when he can't remember it that means you
[46:47] never did it in the first place as
[46:48] brother branham said amen
[46:51] amen but beyond that we were a chosen
[46:53] people but then he says you're a royal
[46:55] priesthood
[46:56] now that's no small thing for a jew
[46:58] because the priesthood was special and
[47:00] then the priesthood came from a special
[47:01] line of people they had to have special
[47:03] qualifications you could be born into
[47:05] the tribe of levi but that didn't
[47:07] automatically make you a priest that
[47:09] could handle the word amen they had to
[47:11] have what they had to have a an
[47:12] unblemished body they couldn't have you
[47:14] know
[47:15] missing fingers they couldn't have a
[47:17] stub arm they couldn't have one side
[47:19] shorter than the other they couldn't
[47:20] have large moles in these things on
[47:22] their on their faces they they had to be
[47:24] a representation of holiness but they
[47:25] weren't holy in and of themselves and
[47:27] they absolutely weren't royal there was
[47:29] nothing royal about the levitical
[47:31] priesthood they were just a priesthood
[47:33] that was there to represent the people
[47:35] before god amen
[47:37] they were chosen
[47:38] but they weren't royal
[47:40] and peter says you're chosen but he says
[47:42] you're a royal priesthood and believe me
[47:43] there's a difference between a
[47:44] priesthood and a royal priesthood as
[47:46] we'll talk about it a bit but when we
[47:48] look at the levitical priesthood in
[47:50] numbers 18 it says and the lord spake
[47:52] unto aaron thou shalt have no
[47:55] inheritance in their land that's the
[47:57] land of israel neither shalt thou have
[47:59] any part among them
[48:01] everybody got land except for the
[48:03] levites
[48:04] but he says i am thy part and thine
[48:07] inheritance among the children of israel
[48:09] so we see a type here remember the old
[48:11] testament is always a type and the new
[48:12] testament is fulfillment to that type
[48:14] amen we see a shadow testament so the
[48:17] old testament type is that you don't
[48:19] have an inheritance except the god that
[48:21] you serve
[48:23] but they never had the god that they
[48:24] served
[48:25] right
[48:26] everything they had to go through a veil
[48:28] to get to him and they only could come
[48:30] into his presence one time a year
[48:33] and only one man could go into that
[48:35] presence one time a year so it was very
[48:37] much elective it was very much selective
[48:40] it was very much elite but it was not
[48:42] universal by any means
[48:45] but there's a special thing there
[48:46] because he said i am your inheritance
[48:49] so when we look for our type we're going
[48:51] to see that that has to be our
[48:52] inheritance as well if we're a
[48:54] priesthood amen brother braham says this
[48:56] he says in the old testament there was a
[48:58] veil that hung between the holy place
[49:00] and the holiest of holies
[49:01] only aaron alone was to go in there once
[49:04] a year
[49:05] now the high priest went in he's talking
[49:06] about aaron because in it you know early
[49:08] on aaron was the one that went in but
[49:10] later on what happened was every year
[49:11] they'd have a different high priest and
[49:13] so they'd have a chance to go in and so
[49:14] every man had the opportunity
[49:16] by lot yo so basically they do a lottery
[49:18] and a man and get picked and he was a
[49:20] high priest for the year right so that
[49:21] man could go in but he says but every
[49:24] man that became a priest could have a
[49:27] bite or a taste of the original manna
[49:29] that moses and aaron picked up that
[49:31] first day that the manna began to fall
[49:34] from heaven he says when they crossed
[49:36] the red sea their enemies was killed
[49:38] they were behind them and the next day
[49:40] they went out and all over the ground
[49:41] laid little wafers god rained it down
[49:44] out of heaven they called it manna and
[49:45] it tasted like honey
[49:48] sweet in your mouth but sour in your
[49:49] belly
[49:51] and the peop and the people were just
[49:53] supposed to pick up enough to last them
[49:55] for that one day if they kept it over it
[49:58] contaminated and god told moses and
[50:01] aaron to go out and pick up several
[50:03] overflows of it great baskets and take
[50:06] it by the ark in the holy place so they
[50:08] did this as a commemoration of god's
[50:10] provision and he said gather it up and
[50:13] put it in a pot in the holy place and
[50:15] leave it there
[50:16] but remember he says outside of the holy
[50:18] place it would get brother brahm says
[50:20] he'd get worms in it right it would go
[50:22] bad it'd get maggots in it
[50:23] right it was no good the next day but in
[50:25] the presence of the holy of holies he
[50:27] says and there every time after that
[50:30] generation not after that day he's
[50:33] pointing down generations of priesthoods
[50:35] every generation following that long as
[50:38] long as that levitical priesthood would
[50:40] last i suppose that every man that was
[50:42] eligible to become a priest when he was
[50:45] ordained a priest he had the perfect
[50:47] right to receive a mouthful of the
[50:49] original manna
[50:51] think of it what a privilege that the
[50:53] men thought they would have when a man
[50:54] know that he was coming into the
[50:56] priesthood he was going to get a
[50:58] mouthful of supernatural baked
[51:01] supernatural stirred up
[51:03] supernatural food that came from god out
[51:05] of heaven that had been kept
[51:07] supernaturally
[51:09] everything about this was supernatural
[51:10] it was god's supernatural provision and
[51:12] then it was god's super vigil super
[51:15] natural refrigeration if you could put
[51:17] it to keep it fresh to keep it from
[51:19] going bad in there amen they could
[51:21] always go back to the original
[51:23] that's what we want to talk about here
[51:25] is they could always go back to the
[51:26] original manner from the original source
[51:29] when everything else had gone bad if
[51:31] they were in the presence of god what
[51:33] they got was the original and it never
[51:35] went bad and it never ran out
[51:37] that's the beauty of it is it kept full
[51:39] it kept filling the pot
[51:40] right they didn't eat a wafer and then
[51:42] there was no more left and after a
[51:43] couple years it was all gone god kept it
[51:46] continually refreshed and fresh in his
[51:49] presence and as long as they came into
[51:51] the presence where it was just him and
[51:52] god then that was fresh and he could eat
[51:54] it every time and every man that came in
[51:56] there had the same opportunity amen now
[51:59] peter takes us and he's pointing to this
[52:01] and he says now you are not just a
[52:03] priesthood you're a royal priesthood
[52:05] now what is it that makes us royal we
[52:08] can see priesthood because we can see
[52:09] what we're doing and we're handling the
[52:11] word of god and we're doing the
[52:12] different things maybe that a priest
[52:13] would do is certainly in tight but what
[52:15] makes us royal priesthood
[52:19] we go back to what peter said to what
[52:21] they said in the book of numbers and he
[52:22] says i am your part and what happened on
[52:25] the day on the day of pentecost was
[52:26] peter comes out and he says now we are
[52:29] part of a royal priesthood
[52:31] why because he has experienced the
[52:33] reality
[52:35] of the i am your part and i am your
[52:37] portion because he's had what he's had
[52:39] an infilling of the very life of god and
[52:41] the first things he comes down to he
[52:44] comes out and does is he starts to
[52:45] handle the word of god and he starts to
[52:47] do what he starts to intercede with the
[52:49] people he starts to bring forth a
[52:51] sacrifice out of his mouth he starts to
[52:53] preach the word of god and he's not even
[52:55] a priest what is it he's a royal priest
[52:57] now he's got the king in the camp of his
[53:00] own life and now that makes him royalty
[53:03] because he has the royalty inside of him
[53:05] amen
[53:06] amen when the holy spirit fell
[53:08] then all of a sudden there was a change
[53:10] in their position and they weren't just
[53:11] uh you know fishermen that could barely
[53:14] write their name if they could write it
[53:15] at all they weren't unlearned men but
[53:17] now they were experienced men by the
[53:19] holy spirit and they started to do
[53:21] things that they never thought that they
[53:22] could do before
[53:24] it was what the ordination of the royal
[53:26] priesthood coming out of the coming out
[53:28] of the upper room amen
[53:30] brother braham says this he says the
[53:32] whole ministry is a supernatural he's
[53:35] talking about the ministry of the bride
[53:36] here he says the whole ministry is a
[53:38] supernatural how can people ever say
[53:41] that they are christians and deny the
[53:42] supernatural i don't know how they do it
[53:45] myself look but a supernatural he got a
[53:48] swallow of the supernatural as soon as
[53:50] he became a priest
[53:52] what a beautiful type of now
[53:54] that every person he says them days they
[53:56] had to be born in a certain lineage a
[53:59] levite before they become a priest but
[54:01] now it's whosoever will let him come in
[54:06] he says see and as soon as they come
[54:08] though they must he says a birth is
[54:11] considered in it
[54:13] also you must be born again and every
[54:17] man
[54:18] or woman that's born again of the spirit
[54:21] of god has a right for this day the
[54:24] manna he says this manna is the holy
[54:28] spirit amen amen remember what brother
[54:30] steve was talking about he said remember
[54:32] jesus was saying unless you eat my
[54:34] breath eat my flesh and drink my blood
[54:36] you have no life
[54:39] you have no life inside of you amen
[54:42] you're dead in your sins you're dead in
[54:43] your religion you can sit in here in
[54:45] church all day long you can play the
[54:47] tapes you can read the books but until
[54:49] you have the life until you have the
[54:51] manna until you have the holy spirit
[54:53] inside of you you're not a part of this
[54:54] royal priesthood he says and you have no
[54:57] access now
[54:58] you have no access because only the
[55:00] priesthood has access to the holy of
[55:02] holies if you'll remember amen
[55:04] and he says what every man or woman
[55:07] we're talking to the men because men are
[55:09] in leadership positions in the church
[55:11] and in their homes and they're the ones
[55:13] that take the forefront of it but he
[55:15] says every man or woman can be a part of
[55:18] this priesthood
[55:19] amen there's no limitations on it you
[55:21] don't have to be an adult to be a part
[55:23] of this priesthood all you have to do is
[55:25] have a taste of the manna of the holy
[55:26] spirit in your life amen
[55:29] amen so if that's the original manna
[55:31] he's pointing us to is the very life of
[55:32] christ it's the holy spirit the question
[55:35] is what do we do with supernatural food
[55:38] amen we eat natural food and then what
[55:39] are we supposed to do with it we're
[55:41] supposed to put it into action and then
[55:43] sometimes we do what we sit on the couch
[55:45] and we do nothing
[55:46] but when we see this supernatural manner
[55:48] when we see the holy spirit falling down
[55:50] and the word becoming a reality are we
[55:52] supposed to sit on the couch and do
[55:53] nothing with it
[55:55] no we're supposed to put it into action
[55:56] amen we're supposed to take it and
[55:58] leverage it into doing something for the
[56:00] kingdom of god that's what we saw
[56:03] happened on the day of pentecost amen
[56:05] when we eat natural food we do natural
[56:07] things when we eat supernatural food
[56:09] we're supposed to do supernatural things
[56:11] amen we're supposed to do things that
[56:13] are relating to a supernatural kingdom
[56:15] not to a natural kingdom amen so if
[56:18] you're eating something supernatural
[56:19] then you're going to be doing something
[56:21] supernatural if you're eating of the
[56:23] supernatural word if you're living by
[56:25] the supernatural power of the holy
[56:26] spirit in your life then as a priest
[56:28] you're going to be doing supernatural
[56:30] things relating to god amen it's not
[56:32] going to be carnal it's going to be not
[56:34] it's going to be supernatural amen
[56:36] remember brother steve said he says you
[56:37] can't live unless you eat
[56:40] so the thing is what are we eating today
[56:41] are we eating from the supernatural
[56:43] source of the holy spirit and the word
[56:45] of god or eating from the the natural
[56:47] things of life
[56:48] because what we do in our lives will
[56:50] reflect what we've been spending our
[56:51] time in amen we'll be reflected in what
[56:53] we eat will be what we're doing because
[56:55] if you're not eating supernatural food
[56:56] you're not going to be doing
[56:57] supernatural things that's for sure and
[56:59] then so if we're carnal it's because
[57:01] we've been doing carnal eating and if
[57:02] we're being spiritual then it's because
[57:04] we've been doing spiritual things amen
[57:06] we've been eating from us a spiritual
[57:08] buffet if we want to put it that way
[57:09] amen
[57:12] steve talked about that you remember he
[57:13] was talking about join he talked about
[57:15] that story that brother braham spoke of
[57:16] this spring and he says little spring
[57:18] why are you doing this why are you so
[57:20] bubbly why is there something that just
[57:22] you never stop and he was talking about
[57:25] the joy of the lord and it's because
[57:26] there's more in you than you can contain
[57:29] and so it has to come out somehow and he
[57:31] says this is what we're talking about is
[57:33] when you eat of the supernatural it
[57:36] cannot be contained in the natural and
[57:38] so it's got to keep coming forth out of
[57:40] you and that's what people see in your
[57:41] life is the outflowing of the
[57:43] supernatural holy spirit in your life
[57:46] that you can't contain
[57:48] right and why would you want to contain
[57:49] it i loved your prayer brother dave
[57:51] where he said what he was talking about
[57:52] you are what epistles you're seeing of
[57:55] all men what is it it's the supernatural
[57:58] holy spirit that's bubbling up inside of
[58:00] you and you can't keep it from coming
[58:02] out no matter what our situation is you
[58:04] can't keep it from coming out amen
[58:06] that's how we're supposed to be
[58:07] spiritually is that there's a bubbling
[58:09] it's not always a geyser it's not always
[58:11] this big eruption but it's always going
[58:14] amen there's always something that's
[58:16] coming out of our life and it's
[58:17] something that people can look at and
[58:18] see they're different no matter what's
[58:21] going on they're different amen they
[58:23] don't go up and down
[58:24] with the way things are going they
[58:26] aren't pulled to the left they're pulled
[58:27] to the right they're not easily swayed
[58:29] they've got a focus they've got a
[58:30] purpose and no matter what comes their
[58:32] way no matter what you say to them they
[58:34] always respond kindly they always
[58:35] respond with patience you can't get them
[58:37] worked up you can't make them talk bad
[58:39] about other people
[58:41] amen
[58:43] jesus said in john 4.
[58:46] he's talking to the woman at the well
[58:47] and he says jesus answered and said unto
[58:49] her whosoever drinketh of this water
[58:51] shall thirst again but whosoever
[58:54] drinketh of the water that i shall give
[58:56] him shall never thirst but the water
[58:58] that i shall give him shall be in him a
[59:01] well of water springing up into
[59:03] everlasting life and the woman said unto
[59:06] him sir give me this water that i thirst
[59:09] not neither come hither to draw amen
[59:12] amen
[59:17] you'll amen so many times
[59:20] we're talking to the men tonight mainly
[59:22] but this is not exclusive to the men how
[59:24] many times in jesus life when he walked
[59:26] on this earth was he talking to women
[59:29] it was always a type showing that this
[59:32] is not about gender anymore and we'll
[59:34] see that when we get into the sisters
[59:35] that he was bringing them to a place
[59:37] that they had never been allowed to
[59:39] before through the jewish religion and
[59:40] the jewish traditions amen he was
[59:42] bringing them to a place where they
[59:43] could be heard
[59:44] where they could be recognized where
[59:46] their faith could be put into action
[59:49] and where they they were not identified
[59:51] only by their husbands it meant that
[59:53] they could be spiritual that they could
[59:54] have an effect in the local body in
[59:56] these things but here you have a woman
[59:57] of ill repute and he comes to her he
[59:59] goes out of her his way he says i must
[1:00:01] needs go by samaria to speak to a woman
[1:00:04] that's going to respond to my word
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:08] amen this is a far bigger royal
[1:00:09] priesthood than what they had in the in
[1:00:11] the levitical times amen this is way
[1:00:13] bigger than what they had and it's
[1:00:15] because they're a royal priesthood they
[1:00:16] have so much more power than they ever
[1:00:18] did everything for them was just
[1:00:20] tradition
[1:00:21] it was tradition and the only thing that
[1:00:22] wasn't tradition was when they went into
[1:00:24] the presence of god because that's where
[1:00:26] you had to be careful but everything
[1:00:27] else it was just by rote we do this and
[1:00:29] we do this and we do this we do this but
[1:00:31] when you went into that presence of god
[1:00:32] that's where the supernatural was
[1:00:34] occurring amen it was a special time it
[1:00:36] was a special place but when christ died
[1:00:38] that veil was torn and it represented
[1:00:40] access to all men women children boys
[1:00:43] girls didn't matter who you are the when
[1:00:45] the veil was torn everybody had full
[1:00:48] access to this priesthood amen
[1:00:50] amen and then we come into the book of
[1:00:52] acts and it wasn't just a type anymore
[1:00:54] it wasn't just for particular people it
[1:00:56] was for every single one it wasn't
[1:00:57] theoretical anymore
[1:00:59] everything was theoretical to that point
[1:01:00] wasn't it they're always looking for
[1:01:02] something
[1:01:03] guess what we don't have to look for
[1:01:05] something anymore it's here right now
[1:01:07] it's been here for for two 2000 years
[1:01:09] ever since the day of pentecost he meant
[1:01:11] that we have a reality of god amen we
[1:01:14] have moved into the reality where he is
[1:01:16] our actual portion
[1:01:18] it's not just a promise that i'll give
[1:01:19] you a land and i'll give you a home and
[1:01:21] i'll keep your enemies off you but now
[1:01:23] we have a god that we pray to it one on
[1:01:25] one we don't have to go through a man we
[1:01:27] don't have to come to a pastor we can go
[1:01:29] directly to god we don't have to come to
[1:01:31] jerusalem we don't have to come to
[1:01:33] church we don't have to go and lay
[1:01:34] ourselves at a ministry but we have
[1:01:36] access to a god because he has put
[1:01:38] himself directly inside of us and we
[1:01:40] carry him everywhere we go amen we don't
[1:01:42] have to look to some place we don't have
[1:01:44] to pray to jeffersonville we don't have
[1:01:46] to pray to jerusalem right we don't have
[1:01:48] to look towards this place we can reach
[1:01:51] we could we don't even have to drop to
[1:01:52] our knees we can just talk to him
[1:01:54] anytime we want and we have 24 7 access
[1:01:57] because we are a royal priesthood amen
[1:02:00] and like we said you became royalty when
[1:02:03] he came into you but the thing is you
[1:02:04] always were royalty it's because you
[1:02:06] were royalty that he came into you in
[1:02:08] the first place amen because you were a
[1:02:10] child of god you always were a part of
[1:02:11] god and all he's doing is confirming to
[1:02:13] you he's letting you know you always
[1:02:15] were a part of me amen and that's why
[1:02:17] you have access today amen even simeon
[1:02:19] who recognized jesus and blessed him
[1:02:21] didn't have the holy ghost
[1:02:23] it said the holy spirit was upon him it
[1:02:26] was an anointing but it was not an
[1:02:27] indwelling and he was a priest
[1:02:29] he was a priest he worked there but he
[1:02:31] didn't have it in him he just had it on
[1:02:33] him and it was enough for him to
[1:02:34] recognize and that was all he had but
[1:02:36] now we have a reality that even simeon
[1:02:38] didn't have in his great revelation and
[1:02:40] recognizing god peter had a greater
[1:02:42] revelation than simeon ever did because
[1:02:44] it was in him and he was doing things in
[1:02:45] peter that peter knew he could never do
[1:02:47] by himself amen
[1:02:49] now you say so what
[1:02:51] it's great brother jonathan we're royal
[1:02:53] we're a priesthood we're a royal
[1:02:55] priesthood so what what does that do for
[1:02:57] us
[1:02:58] how do we apply it
[1:02:59] does it even matter today whether you
[1:03:01] know if you're a part of the royal
[1:03:02] priesthood does it matter if a man knows
[1:03:05] if he's a member of the royal priesthood
[1:03:07] well absolutely he does amen
[1:03:10] brother brahm said this he says did you
[1:03:11] ever know what a priesthood is what his
[1:03:14] office is he says a priest is to make
[1:03:17] sacrifice
[1:03:18] and to make intercession
[1:03:21] and over in hebrews it said that we the
[1:03:23] church is the royal priesthood a royal
[1:03:26] priesthood a holy nation of peculiar
[1:03:28] people see a holy nation peculiar people
[1:03:31] royal priesthood he says offering here
[1:03:34] it is now he says offering spiritual
[1:03:37] sacrifices
[1:03:38] every man and woman that comes into the
[1:03:42] comes to god enters into the veil i did
[1:03:45] a little bit of study on the veil that
[1:03:47] hid the holy of holies from everything
[1:03:48] else and we know it had the badger skins
[1:03:50] on it we think that's really what damped
[1:03:52] the sound do you know how thick the veil
[1:03:54] was
[1:03:55] we tend to think of it was just a badger
[1:03:57] skin and with a you know maybe some
[1:03:58] backing cloth on or something do you
[1:04:00] know how thick it was it was three feet
[1:04:03] thick
[1:04:05] and what they did is they had it wasn't
[1:04:07] one curtain you had the badger skins
[1:04:09] on here and so you'd have the badger
[1:04:11] skins like this
[1:04:12] and then what they'd have is they'd have
[1:04:14] a curtain that went like this
[1:04:15] then you'd have a curtain that went like
[1:04:17] that and then one that went like that
[1:04:18] and then one that went like that and
[1:04:20] that and they overlapped it's what we in
[1:04:23] in seals in engineering it's called
[1:04:24] tortured path and the idea is the sound
[1:04:27] can never get through because there's
[1:04:28] never a straight path through it so a
[1:04:30] priest to get in there he had to fight
[1:04:32] his way to get into the holy of holies
[1:04:34] it didn't just part
[1:04:36] it wasn't just like okay guys pull back
[1:04:38] on the strings and let me in he had to
[1:04:40] go through three feet he had to go
[1:04:41] through this pulpit of of interlocking
[1:04:44] cloth to get into there and once he was
[1:04:47] in there that's why he couldn't hear
[1:04:48] anything else was because it was draped
[1:04:50] all the way to the ground all the way to
[1:04:51] the ceiling and he had to fight his way
[1:04:53] through all of these cloths that were
[1:04:54] just lapped one over the other deeply so
[1:04:56] that no sound could ever get through
[1:04:59] that's what that's what christ that's
[1:05:00] what god tore when christ died he tore
[1:05:03] three feet of cloth
[1:05:06] right
[1:05:06] that's like that's like 10 phone books
[1:05:09] that he tore
[1:05:11] so that we could have access amen
[1:05:13] you had to fight to get into it and
[1:05:15] guess what you still have to fight in it
[1:05:16] might be open but you've still got to
[1:05:18] fight in we'll read a quote where
[1:05:19] brother brown talks about it amen but
[1:05:21] what he says a priest offers sacrifice
[1:05:24] and he makes intercession for those that
[1:05:27] are under his care amen amen what does
[1:05:29] it mean to make intercession it means
[1:05:30] they stand between judgment and those
[1:05:33] that are supposed to be judged what is
[1:05:34] it they say lord here is an atonement
[1:05:37] here is a sacrifice here is proof that
[1:05:40] the price was paid and because of that
[1:05:43] you can't touch them amen it's not that
[1:05:45] you're denying god but you're putting in
[1:05:47] front of god the very thing that he said
[1:05:49] would put him off that would hold him
[1:05:51] back from judging the one that's
[1:05:53] standing there amen and it's not that
[1:05:54] we're saying they're not deserving lord
[1:05:57] doesn't mean there isn't a penalty be
[1:05:58] paid but the priest makes intercession
[1:06:00] by showing proof that the price is paid
[1:06:04] and that's the thing that makes him an
[1:06:05] intercessor is that he or she has
[1:06:07] something that they can hold up and say
[1:06:09] lord you cannot touch them there's a
[1:06:11] price that's been paid here and we're
[1:06:13] standing in there and we're interceding
[1:06:15] and we're atoning there's blood on the
[1:06:17] mercy seat as brother steve said and you
[1:06:19] can't touch them just yet you haven't
[1:06:21] get you've allowed us to do that amen
[1:06:23] but remember you couldn't intercede for
[1:06:25] someone else until you you felt you
[1:06:27] yourself were first accepted remember
[1:06:30] the priest had to go in by himself with
[1:06:32] the blood and that had to be accepted
[1:06:34] and he had to come out alive and
[1:06:36] forgiven
[1:06:38] and then after that he'd go in back in
[1:06:41] with the blood and the sacrifice for the
[1:06:42] congregation and then they could be
[1:06:45] forgiven but he had to go in himself he
[1:06:48] had to go in and he had to make sure
[1:06:49] that hit the token was applied to him
[1:06:51] before he went and applied the token to
[1:06:53] somebody else amen and you'll see these
[1:06:55] things today where people get into a bad
[1:06:57] spot you'll see people in the world
[1:06:58] maybe co-workers even family members
[1:07:00] that aren't serving the lord and they
[1:07:01] get in a bad spot they get into a health
[1:07:03] situation they get into a job crisis
[1:07:05] they get into a marital crisis
[1:07:07] something bad happens what happens they
[1:07:09] go when they pray to god
[1:07:11] and all of a sudden they're going before
[1:07:12] the throne and they're trying to come
[1:07:14] into the presence of god and what
[1:07:16] usually happens
[1:07:18] god turns a blind eye
[1:07:19] why because they didn't come his way
[1:07:22] and what they're doing is they're coming
[1:07:24] in and they're saying i want you god and
[1:07:26] he's saying but you didn't come my way
[1:07:28] and you don't have a token so all that's
[1:07:30] here for you is judgment
[1:07:32] so why do they end up coming to us folks
[1:07:35] because we've got a token
[1:07:37] why does god hear your prayer and not
[1:07:38] theirs because you've got a token to
[1:07:40] take before him amen that you've been
[1:07:42] called into a royal priesthood and you
[1:07:44] have access to that holy of holies and
[1:07:47] he will not do it if you ask him
[1:07:49] you've got something you can hold back
[1:07:51] he's given you that power he's given you
[1:07:53] that power
[1:07:54] amen he's given you something to hold
[1:07:56] back the judgment until we're gone and
[1:07:58] when we're gone there's no holding it
[1:07:59] back but as long as we're here there's
[1:08:01] mercy amen and that's why you've got to
[1:08:03] make sure that you've got the atonement
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:06] amen listen faith is what touches god
[1:08:09] desperation does not touch god you know
[1:08:12] what desperation doesn't bring god into
[1:08:14] your home you know what desperation does
[1:08:16] it brings you to god instead amen it
[1:08:18] takes you from your stupid thinking from
[1:08:21] your blind ways from your insistence on
[1:08:23] having your own way and it takes you out
[1:08:26] of that because you say this isn't
[1:08:27] working lord so i've got to come to you
[1:08:30] i've got to return back home like the
[1:08:32] prodigal son i've got to come back to
[1:08:33] where you're standing and waiting and
[1:08:35] then when it gets that bad that's what
[1:08:37] you're doing and you're giving god
[1:08:38] access to your situation when you say
[1:08:40] i'll come to you
[1:08:42] right because too often what we're doing
[1:08:43] is we're standing in our own decision in
[1:08:45] the filth of our own thinking and then
[1:08:48] we're saying god come in and he says i
[1:08:50] can't come in there you've got to come
[1:08:51] into the holy of holy son you've got to
[1:08:53] come into the holiest place daughter
[1:08:55] you've got to come to me and you've got
[1:08:57] to show me that you're willing to make a
[1:08:59] change here as well i'm not coming in to
[1:09:00] change you you've got to come out of
[1:09:02] your mess and let me now take it and
[1:09:04] make something out of it amen we've got
[1:09:06] to come to him so what happens what
[1:09:08] people come to us and they say pray
[1:09:10] your children come to you and say daddy
[1:09:12] i'm feeling sick your spouse comes to
[1:09:14] you and she's saying i'm not doing so
[1:09:15] well there's something going on in my
[1:09:17] body
[1:09:18] dad's
[1:09:19] husbands you better have your atonement
[1:09:21] sorted out when that happens amen you
[1:09:23] better make sure you got the token when
[1:09:25] they come into your room because you're
[1:09:26] going to be the one that has to lay
[1:09:27] hands on them and take them before the
[1:09:29] throne of grace and say lord i've got
[1:09:31] what you've given me and that's the holy
[1:09:33] spirit and you said if i waved that over
[1:09:35] them then you'd give me what i asked for
[1:09:37] right where two or three one or two
[1:09:40] if they'd agree on it two or three would
[1:09:42] agree on it if we'd agree on it we have
[1:09:44] those tokens and he said he'd do it
[1:09:46] because the holy spirit will never pray
[1:09:48] against the will of god right but he
[1:09:50] says you've got to have a token you've
[1:09:51] got to have something that you bring and
[1:09:52] if you don't you have no right being a
[1:09:54] husband you have no right being a father
[1:09:56] and then you've got to make sure you've
[1:09:58] got that token because they're going to
[1:09:59] rely on it in your family and in your
[1:10:01] household amen you don't step behind a
[1:10:03] pulpit without a token you don't step
[1:10:05] into a church role without a token none
[1:10:07] of those things can happen until you've
[1:10:08] got a holy ghost token inside of you
[1:10:10] that brings you into the presence of god
[1:10:12] and it gives you access to it whenever
[1:10:15] you have need of it amen that's what a
[1:10:16] royal priesthood has amen why you're
[1:10:19] ordained to do this
[1:10:21] we talk about ordaining of ministers you
[1:10:22] have to be ordained into the priesthood
[1:10:24] amen by fathers and husbands you're
[1:10:26] ordained into those roles and it is to
[1:10:28] take a position of spiritual authority
[1:10:30] in your household and if you're not
[1:10:32] doing that it doesn't matter how much
[1:10:34] money you're bringing in doesn't matter
[1:10:35] how big your house is or how many cars
[1:10:37] you have you're still out of your
[1:10:40] position and you're not in balance amen
[1:10:42] you've got to have that position of
[1:10:43] spiritual authority in your house where
[1:10:45] you can take your family to the throne
[1:10:46] of god not just on a need basis but on a
[1:10:49] daily basis because that's your role is
[1:10:51] to bring them before the throne of god
[1:10:53] every single day amen
[1:10:55] amen you're interceding and you're not a
[1:10:57] priest if you're not interceding for
[1:10:58] others the priest was not there for
[1:11:00] himself he had to go in and make sure
[1:11:02] that he was right with god but the
[1:11:04] priest was there for everybody else that
[1:11:06] was under his under his responsibility
[1:11:08] under his authority and these different
[1:11:09] things amen
[1:11:11] so what are they doing look at moses
[1:11:13] moses he was the great interceder wasn't
[1:11:15] he was moses was standing in the gap
[1:11:17] remember and god's ready to destroy them
[1:11:20] and moses says lord don't do it
[1:11:23] don't do it and guess what they were a
[1:11:25] thorn in moses side all of his time they
[1:11:27] were whiny they were childish they were
[1:11:30] rebellious they were idolatrous they
[1:11:32] were adulterous they were everything
[1:11:34] that you wouldn't want in a congregation
[1:11:36] brother gerald
[1:11:37] right they were the worst church ever
[1:11:41] and he stood there and he said lord
[1:11:43] don't do it
[1:11:44] don't do it even though it drove him
[1:11:46] nuts yet his great love for them he said
[1:11:49] lord don't do it
[1:11:50] and he stood in the gap
[1:11:52] and he stood in the gap and he said
[1:11:54] don't do until god backed off and god
[1:11:56] heeded it
[1:11:57] psalms 106 you it's weird to find
[1:11:59] something about this in the book of
[1:12:00] psalms rather you know in exodus or
[1:12:02] these different places but psalms 106 23
[1:12:05] says therefore he said that he would
[1:12:06] destroy them had not moses his chosen
[1:12:11] stood before him in the breach to turn
[1:12:13] away his wrath lest he should destroy
[1:12:15] them notice that we read earlier that we
[1:12:18] are a chosen generation here's a
[1:12:20] different version of chosen this isn't
[1:12:22] just predestination this is
[1:12:23] predestinated to take a place to be
[1:12:26] destinated to stand in the gap
[1:12:28] predestinated to intercede on behalf of
[1:12:30] others and hold back judgment until they
[1:12:33] can come to a place where they can they
[1:12:34] can stand before god on their own two
[1:12:36] feet amen this is a chosen and royal
[1:12:39] priesthood is that they are there to
[1:12:40] intercede amen to stand there and say
[1:12:43] lord have mercy lord restore them lord
[1:12:46] be gracious to them lord heal them yes i
[1:12:49] know they're not serving you yes i know
[1:12:50] they're not in the right place but lord
[1:12:52] for your glory do this that they might
[1:12:54] see that you're still alive and well
[1:12:56] amen you are chosen to intercede not
[1:12:59] just chosen to be yourself a child of
[1:13:01] god but you are chosen to intercede on
[1:13:03] the needs of others not only for
[1:13:05] children of god but those that maybe
[1:13:07] aren't yet because we don't know who is
[1:13:09] and who isn't amen but we're there to
[1:13:11] intercede as god lays on our hearts and
[1:13:12] as god puts people into our spheres of
[1:13:14] influence and under our households and
[1:13:16] these different things he puts them
[1:13:18] there so that you can intercede on their
[1:13:20] behalf amen
[1:13:21] amen so my question is this when
[1:13:23] somebody does wrong
[1:13:24] when somebody messes up when somebody's
[1:13:26] walking down the wrong path when
[1:13:28] somebody makes a decision we don't agree
[1:13:30] with then are we taking them before the
[1:13:32] throne of mercy or are we taking them
[1:13:34] before the throne of judgment because a
[1:13:36] priest will always take you to the mercy
[1:13:38] seat he doesn't take you to the judgment
[1:13:40] seat he goes in with blood he goes in
[1:13:42] with a token that the price was paid
[1:13:44] beforehand so that god can bring mercy
[1:13:47] to that person and per chance they
[1:13:49] should come and realize how foolish
[1:13:51] they're being amen so as priests as
[1:13:54] royal priests that ought to be the way
[1:13:55] we respond when things don't go the way
[1:13:58] we think they should and then as we go
[1:14:00] and we take that person before the
[1:14:01] throne of grace with our token
[1:14:04] they may not have their token but you're
[1:14:06] taking your token you're saying lord
[1:14:08] move
[1:14:08] on their behalf show them grace open
[1:14:11] their eyes help them to see what's going
[1:14:12] on help them to see the damage they're
[1:14:14] doing to themselves help them to see the
[1:14:15] damage they're doing to their family to
[1:14:17] the local body in their job whatever it
[1:14:19] might be you have your own situations
[1:14:21] you might know about but we're in and
[1:14:22] we're supposed to be bringing them to
[1:14:23] the mercy seat because that's what a
[1:14:25] priest does the priest never stood in
[1:14:27] judgment the priest was always there for
[1:14:29] mercy
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:33] the question is when someone's in need
[1:14:35] whether or not they realize it because
[1:14:36] they don't always realize it do they
[1:14:38] whether they realize it or not are we
[1:14:40] the ones that are first in line to take
[1:14:42] him before the throne of grace amen are
[1:14:44] we quick to put our token on display and
[1:14:45] say lord i'll stand for them
[1:14:47] lord i'll put my token on the line for
[1:14:49] them and ask your grace and mercy and
[1:14:51] favor that they could see where they
[1:14:52] need to be that they could come to a
[1:14:54] real realization of the reality of god
[1:14:56] in their life amen
[1:14:59] said this he said nathanael said to him
[1:15:00] to david do all that's in your heart
[1:15:02] david for god's with you
[1:15:04] and then brother braham says well this
[1:15:05] is in what's what's in my heart lord to
[1:15:08] pray a prayer of faith for these poor
[1:15:10] sick people will you receive me lord
[1:15:14] he says i put myself in the channel here
[1:15:17] to intercede through jesus christ for
[1:15:19] these people the good shepherd who
[1:15:21] stands there striped and wounded for our
[1:15:23] transgressions
[1:15:24] with his stripes we were healed and
[1:15:26] father i come with his blessings for the
[1:15:28] people i come with his spirit with his
[1:15:31] anointing with his words and there oh
[1:15:35] out over the people now as it was like
[1:15:37] grains of food and they've received that
[1:15:40] he says oh god may they take root right
[1:15:43] now
[1:15:43] may life begin to spring may the seed
[1:15:46] begin to break open life begin to raise
[1:15:49] up strength begin to come into weak
[1:15:51] bodies sight begin to come into blind
[1:15:54] eyes and strengthen the feeble knees oh
[1:15:57] god may it start growing the holy spirit
[1:16:00] purging it purging it on and on and on
[1:16:03] until one great victorious stream of god
[1:16:07] and every sick person be healed right
[1:16:10] here tonight he says oh blessed god hear
[1:16:13] the prayer of your profitable servant
[1:16:16] through jesus christ's name that's
[1:16:18] intercession brothers and sisters amen
[1:16:20] now you say well i'm not brother branham
[1:16:23] i'm not a minister i'm not a man i'm not
[1:16:25] a prophet i don't have this ministry
[1:16:27] listen i don't care how old you are i
[1:16:29] don't care what your gender is i don't
[1:16:30] care what you look like i don't care
[1:16:32] what ministry you have i don't care what
[1:16:34] ministry you don't have when you are a
[1:16:36] part of the royal priesthood you have
[1:16:38] the same access that he did to the
[1:16:40] supernatural god you have the same
[1:16:41] access to deliverance you have the same
[1:16:43] access to healing you have the same
[1:16:45] access to guidance you have the same
[1:16:47] access to direction
[1:16:48] you have the same access to peace and
[1:16:50] rest and not only for you but for those
[1:16:52] that are of your household amen
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:55] we're talking to the men
[1:16:57] primarily again today but this is for
[1:16:58] the women amen the women have so much in
[1:17:01] that that they have available to them as
[1:17:03] a mother as a wife
[1:17:05] as a prayer warrior amen don't let look
[1:17:08] at the men tonight let's look at
[1:17:10] everyone and say we all have access we
[1:17:12] all have a token if we have the holy
[1:17:14] spirit to do everything amen everything
[1:17:17] that god has given us in terms of the
[1:17:18] spiritual gifts and the redemptive gifts
[1:17:20] of christ on the cross amen listen
[1:17:23] brother branham follows it up he says do
[1:17:24] you believe in this building all of you
[1:17:27] just now
[1:17:28] do we all believe
[1:17:30] he says the lord jesus christ is here to
[1:17:33] make well to make whole to heal every
[1:17:36] person in divine presence if you do he
[1:17:40] says if you do believe i want you to do
[1:17:42] something for me i want you to look this
[1:17:44] way now and put your hands over on one
[1:17:48] another just a moment
[1:17:50] all the sick and needy lay your hands on
[1:17:53] each other i tell you you might not want
[1:17:55] to believe me but there's dozens of you
[1:17:57] healed right now
[1:17:59] i've seen him something happened he says
[1:18:02] you're anointed with the holy spirit now
[1:18:04] and the gift of god is in the building
[1:18:07] amen he doesn't differentiate between
[1:18:09] men and women he doesn't differentiate
[1:18:11] between young and old he says if you
[1:18:14] believe then you lay your hands on the
[1:18:16] situation you lay your hands on the
[1:18:18] person and you pray believing and he
[1:18:21] says it's already happening in the midst
[1:18:23] of you and you don't even know it
[1:18:25] why because it's a royal priesthood and
[1:18:27] they're going and they're interceding
[1:18:29] for each other and the presence of god
[1:18:30] moves through and he's answering the
[1:18:32] token applied and all of a sudden
[1:18:34] healing is going through the building it
[1:18:35] wasn't his prayer it was their prayer it
[1:18:38] was in his hands it was their hands why
[1:18:40] they were giving a sacrifice and
[1:18:42] interceding on behalf of others and god
[1:18:44] respected it and healing moved through
[1:18:46] the building amen we don't have to call
[1:18:48] a pastor to pray for us
[1:18:50] he's here if we need them but we don't
[1:18:51] have to call a pastor i mean we have a
[1:18:54] god that's not even right here he's
[1:18:55] right here and we can talk to him and we
[1:18:58] can go right to him we have 24 7 access
[1:19:01] we have a direct line to the holy spirit
[1:19:03] amen and he can answer our prayer
[1:19:05] anytime we need it
[1:19:07] i like what brother steve said i quote
[1:19:10] brother steve a lot tonight
[1:19:12] he said next time you get a toothache
[1:19:14] pray first
[1:19:15] next time you get a headache pray first
[1:19:18] because what we want the supernatural in
[1:19:20] our midst and what do we do we go
[1:19:21] straight to practical
[1:19:23] you want the supernatural you got to let
[1:19:25] the supernatural have a chance that
[1:19:27] means you've got to step back from the
[1:19:29] practical you've got to step back from
[1:19:30] the logical and if the word says he'll
[1:19:32] do it then you've got to give him a
[1:19:34] chance to do it otherwise you're never
[1:19:36] going to see the supernatural in your
[1:19:37] midst amen we've got to give the word a
[1:19:39] chance we've got to give the holy spirit
[1:19:41] a chance to move
[1:19:43] and see what he does
[1:19:44] and see if he's not faithful to what he
[1:19:46] said he would do amen but remember what
[1:19:48] he says do you believe
[1:19:50] if you don't believe go straight to
[1:19:52] practical amen
[1:19:54] if you don't believe go straight to
[1:19:56] practical go straight to the advil go
[1:19:57] straight
[1:19:58] whatever but if you do believe take it
[1:20:00] before him and let the word have an
[1:20:02] action in your life amen
[1:20:05] amen
[1:20:06] practical is too often code for i don't
[1:20:09] want to trust god or i don't trust god
[1:20:11] amen we want to be practical in our
[1:20:13] christian walk don't we but when it
[1:20:15] comes to the supernatural there's
[1:20:16] nothing practical about it you have to
[1:20:18] believe and you have to act and you have
[1:20:20] to wait and let god move on that amen
[1:20:23] amen now it's not just interceding the
[1:20:25] prophet said we also offer sacrifices
[1:20:27] and he pointed us to hebrews 13.
[1:20:30] he says for here we have no continuing
[1:20:33] city but we seek one to come and then we
[1:20:35] remember we spoke on the royal seat we
[1:20:37] are abraham's royal seed and now we are
[1:20:39] the royal priesthood and we're not
[1:20:41] looking to fix the kingdom we're in
[1:20:43] we're looking for the kingdom that is to
[1:20:44] come remember the kingdom to come is
[1:20:46] here
[1:20:47] it's already here jesus said the kingdom
[1:20:49] of god is within you it's here right now
[1:20:52] it's not in its fullness and it's not in
[1:20:54] its earthly manifestation but the
[1:20:55] kingdom of god is here amen so is our
[1:20:57] priesthood being focused on fixing the
[1:20:59] kingdom we're in or is it focused on
[1:21:01] bringing to fruition the kingdom that
[1:21:02] we're supposed to be a part of already
[1:21:04] and that we're looking forward to come
[1:21:05] in the future amen we're supposed to be
[1:21:07] acting now to bring the kingdom of
[1:21:09] heaven into place not to fix the one
[1:21:11] we're in now amen
[1:21:12] he says by him therefore let us offer
[1:21:15] the sacrifice of praise
[1:21:18] to god occasionally
[1:21:23] no no no he said offer the sacrifice of
[1:21:25] praise to god continually that is the
[1:21:29] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[1:21:33] name
[1:21:34] what does that sound like that sounds
[1:21:35] like thank you jesus
[1:21:38] praise the lord
[1:21:40] right that's what it sounds like let's
[1:21:42] not be silly about it thank you lord
[1:21:44] thank you jesus that's constantly what
[1:21:46] he's talking about that's what coming
[1:21:48] out of our lives our lips
[1:21:50] that does he say in the good times
[1:21:52] he says continually
[1:21:54] i'm reminded of what brother ron spencer
[1:21:56] said he says i don't want you to pray
[1:21:58] for my healing he said i want you to
[1:22:00] thank god for my healing that's what
[1:22:02] it's supposed to look like in these
[1:22:03] situations is you don't look to the
[1:22:05] symptoms you don't look to the
[1:22:06] difficulty but you thank god that he's
[1:22:08] promised an answer and that all things
[1:22:10] would work together for your good no
[1:22:13] matter how hard it looks right now amen
[1:22:17] brother brown says this
[1:22:21] this is tough
[1:22:22] this is tough let's be honest
[1:22:24] continually giving praise
[1:22:26] when the bank account doesn't look so
[1:22:28] good when the health is failing when
[1:22:30] we're getting up in age amen when our
[1:22:33] job isn't so great when our marriage is
[1:22:35] struggling when we've got a kid that's
[1:22:36] showing inclinations toward the world
[1:22:39] right this is not an easy thing to do
[1:22:41] but paul peter says or paul says to do
[1:22:43] it continually no matter what
[1:22:45] right this is a test of your faith is
[1:22:48] will you continue to say praise the lord
[1:22:49] when it looks like there's nothing to
[1:22:51] praise him about
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] what is it it's a wellspring
[1:22:57] springing up within you and it cannot be
[1:22:59] quenched by circumstance amen
[1:23:03] brother branham he's speaking now of
[1:23:05] peter on the day of pentecost and he's
[1:23:06] talking about receiving the promise of
[1:23:07] the holy spirit he says what was god
[1:23:09] saying there he said the same thing he
[1:23:11] said to moses in other words this holy
[1:23:13] ghost manna that began to fall on the
[1:23:15] day of pentecost was to sustain the
[1:23:18] church and the church was to live only
[1:23:21] by the holy spirit until the day we
[1:23:23] enter the millennium he says hallelujah
[1:23:25] what is it he says it's the same holy
[1:23:27] spirit he's talking about now
[1:23:29] he says now notice it was for everyone
[1:23:31] that was a priest in the old testament
[1:23:34] he says everyone in the new testament
[1:23:36] that becomes a christian
[1:23:38] born again becomes a priest to god
[1:23:41] and we are priests and we are kings
[1:23:44] a priest is to make sacrifice and we
[1:23:46] give to god the sacrifice of our lips
[1:23:48] giving praise to his name you say i
[1:23:51] don't feel like it he says do it anyhow
[1:23:55] that's a sacrifice hallelujah say i feel
[1:23:58] too tired
[1:24:01] listen to this
[1:24:02] i feel too tired the devil will tell you
[1:24:05] that until he takes you to hell
[1:24:09] whoa
[1:24:11] i feel too tired to praise the lord he
[1:24:14] says the devil will tell you that and
[1:24:15] take you all the way to hell with that
[1:24:17] attitude
[1:24:18] amen wow we ought to be careful
[1:24:22] about how we let our our our human
[1:24:24] energy come sometimes get us down amen
[1:24:27] that it would hold us back
[1:24:29] hold us back from church attendance hold
[1:24:31] us back from devotions hold us back from
[1:24:33] prayer hold us back from giving time to
[1:24:34] god and showing him that we're going to
[1:24:36] give him praise amen
[1:24:38] he says that's right you're to make a
[1:24:40] spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our
[1:24:42] lips giving praise to his name priests
[1:24:44] and kings unto god the bible said we
[1:24:46] were that he made us priests and kings
[1:24:48] unto god now listen to this next quote
[1:24:50] he says eating what what is it that's
[1:24:53] going to give you this continual praise
[1:24:55] he says living alone because remember in
[1:24:58] the holy of holies who are you with
[1:25:01] there's only one in there
[1:25:03] when you're eating from the hidden manna
[1:25:05] there was only you and one other person
[1:25:07] you were in there alone it was an unseen
[1:25:09] presence but it was a presence
[1:25:10] nonetheless but it was just you
[1:25:13] it wasn't anybody else in there
[1:25:15] right so what he's saying is don't go
[1:25:17] find an alternate diet
[1:25:19] don't add somebody else into the mixer
[1:25:21] he says eat alone
[1:25:22] israel didn't go out and try and get
[1:25:24] some wild oats and break them up and
[1:25:27] make some corn cakes
[1:25:28] they didn't blend other foods with manna
[1:25:30] they just ate the manna straight
[1:25:32] he says that's what's the matter with
[1:25:34] the church tonight they've got too many
[1:25:36] wild oats and that's your diet
[1:25:39] you're not eating from the original
[1:25:40] manna he says you've blended something
[1:25:42] in to make it taste a little different
[1:25:45] to make it a little more interesting to
[1:25:46] make it a little more palatable he says
[1:25:49] don't do it he says you need a good
[1:25:52] old-fashioned bible diet is what you
[1:25:54] need
[1:25:55] he says this the pastor will tell you
[1:25:58] the truth about the bible he says thank
[1:26:01] god we got plenty of them
[1:26:03] amen the pastor will tell you what you
[1:26:06] need
[1:26:07] i like how brother steve brought it out
[1:26:09] this weekend where he talked about
[1:26:10] people treating their ability to stream
[1:26:11] services as a spiritual buffet you know
[1:26:14] what struck me when he said that is that
[1:26:16] i have never seen a healthy person at a
[1:26:18] buffet that eats at a buffet all the
[1:26:20] time you ever notice that the biggest
[1:26:23] people are at the buffets why because
[1:26:25] they can eat as much of the uh they can
[1:26:27] eat as much as they want of whatever
[1:26:29] they want
[1:26:31] amen now you say well it's a word buffet
[1:26:33] brother jonathan you can't eat too much
[1:26:34] of that guess what what you can do is
[1:26:37] eat everything that you want and nothing
[1:26:39] that you don't and that's what makes it
[1:26:42] a spiritually bad buffet because what
[1:26:44] happens is you'll turn that stream on
[1:26:46] and then the brother will start stepping
[1:26:47] on your toes and so you'll turn it off
[1:26:49] and you'll go to the next brother and
[1:26:51] you'll turn it on until he steps on your
[1:26:52] toes and then you'll go and you'll turn
[1:26:53] it on till the next one does it and so
[1:26:55] you're just going and what you're doing
[1:26:57] is you're eating steak and donuts
[1:26:59] instead of the fresh greens and the the
[1:27:02] broccoli and all the disgusting things
[1:27:03] that we're not supposed to like but
[1:27:05] we're supposed to eat right
[1:27:08] i'm speaking from personal experience
[1:27:10] here right
[1:27:11] all the things that i'm supposed to eat
[1:27:15] are not delicious
[1:27:16] and all the things that i'm not supposed
[1:27:18] to eat are delicious and do you think
[1:27:20] for a second that spiritually you're
[1:27:21] going to go for the things that you
[1:27:23] don't like the taste of
[1:27:25] you're not
[1:27:26] when you get to sit at home and choose
[1:27:28] who's going to preach to you today
[1:27:29] you're always going to pick what you
[1:27:31] like rather than what you need
[1:27:33] and it's no different at a buffet who
[1:27:35] has gone to a buffet and said i'm going
[1:27:37] to eat half a plate of things that i
[1:27:39] don't like because that's the healthy
[1:27:40] thing to do
[1:27:42] we have one person that claims it
[1:27:44] and we're going to examine his claim
[1:27:46] after service amen nobody goes to a
[1:27:48] buffet to eat things they don't like you
[1:27:50] go there because they have something for
[1:27:52] everybody and you focus on what you like
[1:27:54] and that's what brother steve was
[1:27:55] getting at was if you're going to stream
[1:27:57] chances are you're going to stream only
[1:27:59] what you like and you're never going to
[1:28:00] get what you actually need amen
[1:28:05] can you imagine
[1:28:07] if all the ministry did up here was
[1:28:08] affirm you
[1:28:11] you're right brother bob you're right
[1:28:12] sister maureen you're right brother mark
[1:28:13] you're right brother jonathan you're
[1:28:14] right brother paul you're right sister
[1:28:16] justine you're right selena you're right
[1:28:17] sister rebecca
[1:28:19] and all he did was stand up here and
[1:28:20] tell you you're right you're perfect
[1:28:22] your your mindset's amazing your
[1:28:25] attitude's great
[1:28:26] your hair is the right length your
[1:28:28] skirts are the right length
[1:28:30] your sideburns aren't too long
[1:28:33] right you showed a great attitude this
[1:28:35] week
[1:28:36] i liked your social media feed this week
[1:28:39] right boy you really helped your wife
[1:28:40] this week and your husband is so no if
[1:28:43] all we did was that why would we call
[1:28:44] this the house of correction it'd be the
[1:28:46] house of affirmation amen we're not here
[1:28:48] for a house of affirmation guess what
[1:28:50] brother steve had some pretty hard
[1:28:51] things to say this weekend for me at
[1:28:53] least
[1:28:54] right now he affirmed me in a few ways
[1:28:57] but he definitely stepped on my toes in
[1:28:58] a few ways amen and you know what if he
[1:29:00] didn't step on my toes i questioned
[1:29:01] where the holy spirit was in those
[1:29:03] meetings because we're not here to just
[1:29:04] be affirmed we're here to be corrected
[1:29:06] and when correction comes it's not
[1:29:08] judgment it's god letting you know i
[1:29:10] love you and i don't want you to get
[1:29:12] into things that are going to draw you
[1:29:14] away from me right we look at correction
[1:29:16] as a bad thing but it's not it's god's
[1:29:17] love scripture says if he doesn't do it
[1:29:20] then you're a bastard
[1:29:21] that you're not even a child of his and
[1:29:23] yet when it comes then we say
[1:29:25] what's he doing what's we're not
[1:29:26] supposed to be doing this
[1:29:28] i don't want to hear that no no no it's
[1:29:30] a house of correction it's a house
[1:29:32] that's doing it out of love for you amen
[1:29:34] paul said this
[1:29:36] if we had a what happens is when we say
[1:29:38] something that
[1:29:39] isn't enjoyed people say well it's just
[1:29:42] his opinion
[1:29:43] or he knows about this situation or he
[1:29:45] knows about that amen
[1:29:47] that's what happens isn't it so often
[1:29:50] you got to be careful when you do that
[1:29:52] because if it was the holy spirit you
[1:29:54] just blasphemed the holy spirit by
[1:29:55] saying it was a man rather than the holy
[1:29:57] spirit amen you got to be very careful
[1:29:59] what's coming over this pulpit as a
[1:30:00] minister but you got to be very careful
[1:30:02] how you judge what comes behind the
[1:30:03] pulpit because if the holy spirit's
[1:30:05] speaking and you say that's just a man
[1:30:08] you blaspheme the holy spirit he says
[1:30:10] there's no forgiving that it's a
[1:30:11] dangerous thing we ought to do it
[1:30:13] we ought to be careful of amen paul said
[1:30:15] it this way in galatians 4 16 he says am
[1:30:18] i therefore become your enemy because i
[1:30:20] tell you the truth paul was a hard man
[1:30:23] paul did a lot of cleaning up paul did a
[1:30:26] lot of correcting he was setting the
[1:30:27] entire church in order for the next two
[1:30:29] to uh two thousand years he had a big
[1:30:32] job to do so paul didn't pull any
[1:30:33] punches did he
[1:30:35] and he said am i become your enemy
[1:30:36] because i'm telling you the truth
[1:30:38] i'm just trying to help you
[1:30:40] amen listen to what brother brahms said
[1:30:42] this is an amazing quote
[1:30:44] he says you are a peculiar people
[1:30:47] a separated people
[1:30:49] a holy people and a royal priesthood
[1:30:51] this is not a random side okay we'll see
[1:30:53] why i'm talking about this because we're
[1:30:54] going to get to verse 17 here in a
[1:30:56] second you'll see why we're talking
[1:30:57] about it
[1:30:58] he says you are all together different
[1:31:01] from the world
[1:31:03] you don't act like them dress like them
[1:31:06] talk like them you are a called out
[1:31:09] separated that's right he says now you
[1:31:11] see what i mean and we say amen i'm
[1:31:12] called out i'm separated
[1:31:14] right we all say it don't we listen to
[1:31:17] the next portion he says
[1:31:19] if you refuse to be separated peculiar
[1:31:24] he says you'll just go away and say that
[1:31:26] preacher's just popping off
[1:31:30] that's the action of an unseparated
[1:31:32] person
[1:31:34] that's that's the action of somebody
[1:31:35] that is not a part of the peculiar
[1:31:37] people
[1:31:38] he says
[1:31:39] am i he says am i popping off this is
[1:31:42] the prophet speaking not me he says am i
[1:31:44] popping off he said it's the scripture
[1:31:47] and then it's the scripture popping off
[1:31:49] he says if i brought it through the word
[1:31:51] then it's not me popping off it's the
[1:31:53] scripture popping off as you put it
[1:31:55] popping off right
[1:31:56] he says then if you've got your ears so
[1:31:59] bored that you've listened to the devil
[1:32:00] and you can never know more hear the
[1:32:02] gospel truth and walk in the light
[1:32:04] that's the mark of the beast amen it's
[1:32:08] serious
[1:32:09] it's serious
[1:32:10] when you judge what comes over a pulpit
[1:32:12] you better apply it by the word and not
[1:32:13] by your opinion because otherwise he
[1:32:15] says your ear is bored and you can never
[1:32:18] hear the word of light amen
[1:32:21] he says you refuse to hear truth and
[1:32:24] liberation that christ has made you free
[1:32:26] from those things
[1:32:28] what when he steps on our toes
[1:32:30] right we're supposed to be free from it
[1:32:31] and when it comes over the pulpit that's
[1:32:33] god saying i want you to be free
[1:32:36] i want you to be free because it's
[1:32:38] holding you back amen amen if you want
[1:32:40] to channel surf different mystery
[1:32:42] ministries have at it but i don't
[1:32:44] believe that's what god has for his
[1:32:45] bride amen he gave them pastors to
[1:32:47] anchor them and he gave him the rest of
[1:32:48] the fivefold ministry to come in and
[1:32:50] feed them as it was needed amen so
[1:32:52] you've got an angry ministry and then
[1:32:53] you've got one that comes in and does
[1:32:54] all those things if you're listening to
[1:32:56] five pastors how is that ever gonna work
[1:32:58] pick five pastors and try and sit under
[1:33:00] five pastoral ministries at the same
[1:33:01] time you can't do it
[1:33:03] because they've got different visions
[1:33:04] they got different anointings they got
[1:33:05] different gifts they got different
[1:33:06] issues in the local assembly you're
[1:33:08] sitting home at your computer and you're
[1:33:09] trying to feed off five pastors
[1:33:11] right can't do it
[1:33:13] god doesn't have five pastors ordained
[1:33:14] for you he's got one ordained for you
[1:33:16] find them and get under them amen
[1:33:20] but paul or he's talking about in and
[1:33:22] brother babs talk about the sacrifice of
[1:33:24] our lips
[1:33:25] right and we talked about what was it it
[1:33:27] was praise the lord thank you jesus and
[1:33:29] these different things but the question
[1:33:30] is what is it that's been coming out of
[1:33:31] your lips in your situations is it
[1:33:34] praise the lord
[1:33:35] is it thank you jesus thank you for the
[1:33:37] word thank you for the promise amen or
[1:33:40] is it what about my lack is it about the
[1:33:43] drought is it about difficulties is it
[1:33:45] about your needs is it about pain or
[1:33:47] frustration or disappointment amen is it
[1:33:49] disease is it about impossibilities is
[1:33:52] it about criticism is that the sacrifice
[1:33:54] of the lips we've been making amen but
[1:33:56] are we stepping into satan's jobs
[1:33:58] because that's his job his job is to
[1:34:00] tell you everything that's wrong
[1:34:02] right i say it all the time satan is the
[1:34:05] accuser of the brethren amen so that is
[1:34:07] satan's job is to point you to the
[1:34:09] negative amen what do brother brother
[1:34:11] steve talk about he talked about what
[1:34:12] the positive word that we've been given
[1:34:14] it's to point us to what god has offered
[1:34:16] us and satan's trying to point us to
[1:34:18] what we have
[1:34:20] right and the thing is are you pointing
[1:34:21] to what you have or you point to what
[1:34:23] god has offered right that's where your
[1:34:24] sacrifice of your lips is going to prove
[1:34:26] itself amen amen because if what we're
[1:34:28] doing is we're spending time sharing and
[1:34:30] testifying about the things that satan's
[1:34:31] accusing the brethren of then we've got
[1:34:33] a spirit on us and we need to repent and
[1:34:35] we need to get the cast out of us
[1:34:36] because that's what it is it is a spirit
[1:34:38] on us that's getting us to testify the
[1:34:40] things that satan talks about rather
[1:34:42] than what the bride of christ talks
[1:34:43] about amen
[1:34:45] then when brother when brother uh steve
[1:34:47] was talking i wrote down this little
[1:34:49] phrase because i was thinking forward to
[1:34:52] this service here and he was talking
[1:34:53] about the way that we speak in these
[1:34:55] things and what i wrote down was this
[1:34:56] phrase and it said the language of the
[1:34:59] bride is the word for her day
[1:35:02] the sacrifice of your lips ought to be
[1:35:04] the word for your day it ought to be
[1:35:05] speaking of the things that god has
[1:35:07] promised that god has done and that god
[1:35:10] is doing and that god is going to do
[1:35:11] that ought to be the language that we
[1:35:12] have amen that ought to be the testimony
[1:35:14] remember we overcome by the blood of the
[1:35:16] lamb and the word of our testimony amen
[1:35:18] so what is your testimony is it of the
[1:35:20] bad things or is it of the good things
[1:35:22] because if you're testifying of the bad
[1:35:23] things what are you going to get more of
[1:35:25] the bad things if you're going to
[1:35:26] testify the good things then guess what
[1:35:28] now you've got you've given god
[1:35:29] something to work with because he is
[1:35:30] what the high priest of our confession
[1:35:33] so if we confess good things we've got a
[1:35:35] high priest that is christ we confess
[1:35:37] bad things who's our high priest
[1:35:39] it's certainly not christ is it there's
[1:35:41] only one other power folks and it's
[1:35:43] satanic so if you're if your testimony
[1:35:45] is negative if your confession is
[1:35:46] negative then you're under a satanic
[1:35:48] priesthood that's where you're at
[1:35:50] that's stark but that's the way it is
[1:35:52] because you've got to be giving the
[1:35:53] right sacrifice and that right sacrifice
[1:35:56] is what in his name according to his
[1:35:58] word amen
[1:36:01] brother brahm said this he says what is
[1:36:03] a spiritual sacrifice he says that's
[1:36:05] what these sons and daughters do which
[1:36:07] are kings and priests yet not in full
[1:36:10] possession
[1:36:11] we're not we don't have it all yet do we
[1:36:14] we have the earnest of it all but we
[1:36:15] don't have it all but he says they're
[1:36:17] not yet in full possession but they're
[1:36:19] making sacrifices offering to god
[1:36:22] spiritual sacrifices the fruit of our
[1:36:24] lips giving praise to him the fruit of
[1:36:26] our lips you say brother branham i just
[1:36:27] don't feel like praising him he says
[1:36:29] that's the time to make the sacrifice
[1:36:32] praise him anyhow kings and priests sons
[1:36:34] and daughters offering spiritual
[1:36:36] sacrifice the fruit of our lips giving
[1:36:38] praise to his name he says while we're
[1:36:40] groaning veiled in this tabernacle of
[1:36:43] humiliation
[1:36:44] has anybody had some humiliation
[1:36:46] recently
[1:36:48] i have he says while we're gr
[1:36:50] brother mark
[1:36:55] while we're groaning veiled in this
[1:36:57] tabernacle of humiliation we have the
[1:36:59] earnest of our perfect complete
[1:37:02] redemption back like we were in the
[1:37:04] beginning when god created adam in the
[1:37:06] garden of eden he says we have a
[1:37:08] foretaste of glory divine by the baptism
[1:37:11] of the holy ghost the refreshment coming
[1:37:15] from the presence of god to water the
[1:37:17] church to make it grow in grace
[1:37:21] and when we're sick we have redemption
[1:37:24] the blessing the attributes of the death
[1:37:26] of christ divine healing as a foresight
[1:37:29] to us that someday this mortal will take
[1:37:31] on immortality he says yes sir amen oh
[1:37:34] my marvelous he's here to do it glory
[1:37:38] man
[1:37:39] amen
[1:37:40] that's what our we're supposed to be
[1:37:42] doing
[1:37:43] we're supposed to be taking that earnest
[1:37:45] and pointing to the fullness
[1:37:47] amen we're supposed to be taking what we
[1:37:49] have and saying that just means there's
[1:37:50] more to come
[1:37:51] that i don't have it but it means
[1:37:53] because i have a portion of it then the
[1:37:55] rest of it has to come because he never
[1:37:56] starts a work that he's not going to
[1:37:58] finish amen he who started the work
[1:38:01] we'll be faithful to complete it so if
[1:38:03] you have the earnest that means you are
[1:38:04] guaranteed to get the fullness amen amen
[1:38:08] i want to finish off as we start to
[1:38:09] close hebrews 13 because remember he
[1:38:12] pointed us there
[1:38:13] and we stopped there and we say well
[1:38:15] that's all brother branham said he was
[1:38:16] just talking about the praise of our
[1:38:17] lips and that's a spiritual sacrifice
[1:38:18] that's not the only thing a spiritual
[1:38:20] sacrifice is that's what he focused on
[1:38:22] but if you go to the next two verses
[1:38:24] then he starts then paul starts to show
[1:38:26] us what other spiritual sacrifices look
[1:38:28] like amen
[1:38:29] so he says here this is one of them it
[1:38:31] says but to do good
[1:38:33] and to communicate forget not for with
[1:38:36] such sacrifices god is well pleased
[1:38:39] so it's not just what you say brothers
[1:38:40] and sisters it's what you do
[1:38:43] that's a sacrifice as well isn't it in
[1:38:45] the amplified it says do not forget or
[1:38:48] neglect to do kindness and good to be
[1:38:51] generous and distribute and contribute
[1:38:54] to the needy for such sacrifices are
[1:38:57] pleasing to god
[1:38:58] amen we don't get just to sit here and
[1:39:00] say we have the greatest message to hit
[1:39:03] this planet
[1:39:04] we have to do
[1:39:06] what the greatest message of this planet
[1:39:07] tells us to do and it points us back to
[1:39:09] the word and the word says don't be
[1:39:10] weary in well-doing and then paul says
[1:39:13] these things that you do
[1:39:14] they're pleasing to god amen we had the
[1:39:17] church here this weekend it was i was so
[1:39:18] proud of everybody because nobody was
[1:39:21] doing nothing we had people that after
[1:39:23] the services were running around
[1:39:24] cleaning up we have the musicians
[1:39:26] playing we have people preparing
[1:39:28] specials we have people hosting we have
[1:39:30] people making food we have people
[1:39:31] helping people bring food in we have
[1:39:33] people moving furniture we have people
[1:39:34] setting things up taking things down
[1:39:36] going here there what was it everybody
[1:39:38] was doing what putting their shoulder to
[1:39:40] the wheel and it's a sacrifice and out
[1:39:42] of the sacrifice comes what a beautiful
[1:39:45] thing
[1:39:45] right we can't lay it all on one one
[1:39:48] family on one household on one person on
[1:39:49] one ministry but when we all get in
[1:39:51] there all of a sudden we have this
[1:39:53] sacrifice that turns into
[1:39:55] praise
[1:39:57] in action praise comes forth amen
[1:40:01] but listen to this next one because this
[1:40:03] is a doozy
[1:40:04] i'm warning you before i read it it's a
[1:40:06] doozy and it's a doozy to me as a
[1:40:08] minister and it's a doozy to me when i'm
[1:40:10] sitting in the in the pew with the rest
[1:40:11] of you
[1:40:12] are you ready
[1:40:16] obey them that have the rule
[1:40:19] over you
[1:40:22] and submit yourselves
[1:40:24] for they watch for your souls as they
[1:40:28] that must give account
[1:40:30] that they may do it with joy and not
[1:40:32] with grief
[1:40:33] for that is unprofitable for you the
[1:40:36] amplified says obey your spiritual
[1:40:38] leaders and submit to them
[1:40:40] continually recognizing their authority
[1:40:42] over you for they are constantly keeping
[1:40:45] watch over your souls and guarding your
[1:40:48] spiritual warfare as men who will have
[1:40:51] to render an account of their trust
[1:40:53] every man has to answer
[1:40:56] do your part to let them do this with
[1:40:58] gladness and not with sighing and
[1:41:00] groaning brother gerald
[1:41:03] for that would not be profitable to you
[1:41:06] either he says he says if they're
[1:41:08] unhappy and doing it because you're
[1:41:10] making their life so difficult he says
[1:41:12] it's not good for them and it's not good
[1:41:13] for you so what's he saying he's saying
[1:41:15] obey those that have the authority over
[1:41:18] you don't make their life difficult
[1:41:20] just for the sake of being difficult
[1:41:23] don't be that guy
[1:41:25] don't be that girl that just wants to
[1:41:27] stand up and always have things their
[1:41:29] way
[1:41:30] right don't be the one that always makes
[1:41:32] a fuss
[1:41:33] he says what let it be simple for them
[1:41:35] so that they're not signing and groaning
[1:41:38] for the work that they have to do with
[1:41:39] you
[1:41:40] this is a sacrifice that gives praise
[1:41:44] right
[1:41:45] because what remember what he said he
[1:41:46] says these people draw nigh to me with
[1:41:48] their lips
[1:41:49] but their heart is where far from me
[1:41:53] oh we talk a good talk but paul says now
[1:41:56] are you going to walk a good walk and he
[1:41:58] says will you do good things and will
[1:42:01] you submit to authority
[1:42:03] that's going to be the proof in the
[1:42:04] pudding of whether or not you're truly
[1:42:06] willing to give spiritual sacrifices
[1:42:09] because spiritual sacrifices are not
[1:42:10] just spiritual they come down and they
[1:42:12] have a physical manifestation amen it
[1:42:14] always comes out in your life in some
[1:42:16] way amen now this takes humility
[1:42:19] because guess what we've got imperfect
[1:42:21] ministry we got imperfect deacons we got
[1:42:24] imperfect song leaders we got imperfect
[1:42:26] trustees
[1:42:28] and you've got a
[1:42:29] scripture says obey him and submit
[1:42:31] yourselves to them
[1:42:32] well that's never going to work
[1:42:35] paul says if you do spiritual sacrifices
[1:42:37] you'll make it work because there's a
[1:42:39] blessing in it amen now remember this
[1:42:41] they are not imperfect because you
[1:42:43] disagree with them
[1:42:45] so often we think we disagree with them
[1:42:47] therefore they're wrong no no no no you
[1:42:50] have to disagree with the word not with
[1:42:51] the person so the person could be right
[1:42:53] and just because you don't want to obey
[1:42:55] you say they're wrong but let it be that
[1:42:57] they're wrong because they're off the
[1:42:58] word not because you just don't want to
[1:42:59] do what they want you to do amen that's
[1:43:01] what he's saying here right you've got
[1:43:03] to submit to them if they're guarding
[1:43:04] your souls and if you have authority if
[1:43:07] you are a husband if you are a father if
[1:43:08] you are a minister if you are a deacon
[1:43:10] you have authority as a man
[1:43:12] and we're supposed to be looking out for
[1:43:14] their souls that are underneath our
[1:43:16] authority we're supposed to be looking
[1:43:18] out for them not making things easy for
[1:43:20] ourselves
[1:43:22] and that is the sacrifice that we have
[1:43:24] to prove out is are we doing it for them
[1:43:26] or are we doing it for us because if
[1:43:28] we're doing it for us then praise of god
[1:43:30] will never come out it'll just build up
[1:43:32] kingdoms and then it'll crumble and fall
[1:43:33] and it'll turn into a denomination every
[1:43:35] time amen
[1:43:37] so this is what
[1:43:39] spiritual sacrifice is supposed to look
[1:43:41] like is that you're looking out for
[1:43:42] those that are beneath you and the ones
[1:43:44] that are beneath you they submit to it
[1:43:46] but you're looking out for their sake
[1:43:48] not for yours so like i said if you
[1:43:50] could take care of all the physical
[1:43:51] needs but you're not providing
[1:43:52] spiritually then there's a problem
[1:43:55] and i've seen it on the other side and
[1:43:56] it's
[1:43:57] honestly just as common as you have men
[1:43:59] that are so spiritually aware that
[1:44:01] they're of no physical use right you've
[1:44:03] got to have these things in balance
[1:44:04] you've got to be able to be a spiritual
[1:44:06] provider and not just a physical
[1:44:08] provider for your family amen
[1:44:11] amen i like what brother steve said you
[1:44:12] know because what pastors and ministers
[1:44:14] are supposed to be looking out for the
[1:44:16] laity we're not supposed to be up here
[1:44:18] to make money to have an easy life
[1:44:21] you know to gain respect or or
[1:44:24] popularity or anything like that we are
[1:44:26] supposed to be looking out for your
[1:44:27] souls to take you all the way to the
[1:44:29] statue of a perfect man or woman in
[1:44:30] christ that's what we're supposed to be
[1:44:32] doing and we're to supposed to put your
[1:44:34] needs above our own needs amen but
[1:44:36] remember what brother steve said is he
[1:44:37] said sometimes what he's got to do
[1:44:39] something to you that doesn't feel so
[1:44:41] good
[1:44:42] the pastor the great shepherd we can put
[1:44:44] it that way amen and what's that he says
[1:44:46] is if you won't take his guidance if he
[1:44:48] won't take his food if he won't stay
[1:44:50] close to the shepherd then what does he
[1:44:51] do he breaks your leg do i guarantee you
[1:44:54] brother gerald you don't like breaking
[1:44:55] legs do you
[1:44:56] because after you break the leg then
[1:44:58] you've got to do all the work of
[1:44:59] carrying that sheep around for a while
[1:45:01] and guess what the ministry doesn't like
[1:45:03] breaking legs any more than anybody else
[1:45:04] does the shepherd doesn't enjoy breaking
[1:45:06] the leg because that's only more work
[1:45:08] for him not less
[1:45:09] right he's got to carry that sheep
[1:45:11] everywhere he's got to hand feed that
[1:45:12] sheep he can't let it walk around and be
[1:45:14] with the other sheep he's got to give it
[1:45:16] so much one-on-one attention that it
[1:45:17] exhausts him so why would he do it
[1:45:20] he'd do it because he loves it it's
[1:45:22] certainly not for his sake that he break
[1:45:23] a leg he do it because he's trying to
[1:45:25] help that sheep out amen
[1:45:27] and sometimes that's called hard
[1:45:28] preaching isn't it
[1:45:30] when you say things that you know are
[1:45:32] going to be difficult for someone to
[1:45:33] swallow but what are you doing you're
[1:45:35] hoping that they'll take it and if they
[1:45:36] don't the leg is broken and then they'll
[1:45:38] come back and hopefully god can work
[1:45:40] with them but even more difficult is
[1:45:42] when they walk away and you've got to
[1:45:43] pull your hands off and say lord i can't
[1:45:45] do anything
[1:45:46] and now you commit them into the hands
[1:45:47] of the great shepherd and that's a far
[1:45:48] worse thing isn't it
[1:45:50] because it's a fearful thing to fall
[1:45:51] into the hands of a living god amen
[1:45:53] taking your hands off whether it's your
[1:45:54] kids
[1:45:55] amen whether it's your kids and you have
[1:45:57] to pull your hands off we don't want to
[1:45:58] do that do we we want to keep them close
[1:46:01] we want to be hard because we know if we
[1:46:03] don't then god's going to be even harder
[1:46:05] right we're trying to do it for their
[1:46:06] sake we're not trying to do it to make
[1:46:07] our lives easy we don't discipline our
[1:46:09] kids just to make our lives easy we
[1:46:10] discipline them so that they can be
[1:46:12] pleasing to god and they can learn what
[1:46:13] it is that pleases him amen so often
[1:46:16] what we do is we're disciplining because
[1:46:17] we want people to like our kids or to
[1:46:20] look up to us as a family no no you're
[1:46:22] doing it for the kids good not for yours
[1:46:24] that's that's what that's what
[1:46:25] discipline is supposed to be about is
[1:46:27] for their good not for yours it's the
[1:46:29] same for the ministry it's not about
[1:46:30] making life easy for us it's about
[1:46:32] bringing you into a living god in a
[1:46:33] relationship with them and anything that
[1:46:35] would come contrary to that we want to
[1:46:37] get it out of your way amen
[1:46:40] brother stevens drew
[1:46:42] said something
[1:46:43] we're talking about remember being
[1:46:44] difficult for the sake of being
[1:46:46] difficult paul said don't do it but
[1:46:47] stephen stru said something he said
[1:46:49] people have forgotten the difference
[1:46:51] between a belief and an opinion
[1:46:54] he says if someone puts a gun to your
[1:46:56] head
[1:46:58] and you are willing to take the bullet
[1:46:59] ensure death rather than change your
[1:47:01] mind
[1:47:02] that's a belief
[1:47:05] everything else is in an opinion and
[1:47:07] it's not worth fighting about
[1:47:09] he says if you wouldn't die for it it's
[1:47:12] it's an opinion
[1:47:14] is that the truth or is that the truth
[1:47:16] how many of us would die for our
[1:47:19] constitutional rights
[1:47:20] most of us wouldn't
[1:47:22] she's like eh whatever but we would die
[1:47:25] for the word
[1:47:26] if we have the holy ghost we would die
[1:47:28] for the word amen
[1:47:29] but yet we let what we let politics we
[1:47:31] let economics we let church situations
[1:47:33] get in there and we do what we get into
[1:47:35] fights and we separate and we cause
[1:47:37] issues and we do this and that and the
[1:47:38] other on the basis of what on opinion
[1:47:41] and we wouldn't even die for it we say
[1:47:43] we would we act like we would but if
[1:47:45] somebody actually held a gun to our head
[1:47:46] we wouldn't do it would we
[1:47:48] what is it we're making things difficult
[1:47:50] for the sake of what an opinion
[1:47:52] right it's not a belief it's not a word
[1:47:54] belief usually it's an opinion because
[1:47:56] if somebody put the gun up we'd say oh
[1:47:58] i'm good we'll do it your way right so
[1:48:00] why don't we
[1:48:01] leave the guns out of it
[1:48:03] and say let's keep it to the word and be
[1:48:06] able to agree to disagree at times you
[1:48:07] know these different things amen paul's
[1:48:10] saying don't be the person that's dying
[1:48:11] over opinions
[1:48:13] if we can put it that way amen
[1:48:15] amen we're about to close we've got two
[1:48:16] things remember so we covered a
[1:48:18] a chosen
[1:48:19] a chosen people a royal priesthood and
[1:48:21] then he said what you were a holy nation
[1:48:24] i'm just going to read a couple quotes
[1:48:25] so that we can we can close out he says
[1:48:27] and until you come in behind that badger
[1:48:29] skin now remember what we said that's
[1:48:31] three feet thick not just the bad your
[1:48:33] skin but all the the linen and
[1:48:34] everything behind it three feet thick
[1:48:36] until you come into that isolation
[1:48:38] chamber until you get out of your old
[1:48:40] skin your old thoughts your old creeds
[1:48:42] and come into the presence of god then
[1:48:44] the word becomes a living reality to you
[1:48:47] then you're awakened to the shekinah
[1:48:49] glory and then the bible becomes a new
[1:48:51] book and then jesus christ is the same
[1:48:53] yesterday today and forever he says
[1:48:57] you're living in his presence eating the
[1:48:59] show bread that's only provided that day
[1:49:01] for believers it's for priests only and
[1:49:04] we are priests a royal priesthood a holy
[1:49:07] nation peculiar people giving spiritual
[1:49:09] sacrifices to god but you must come in
[1:49:13] to behind the veil to see the unveiled
[1:49:15] god
[1:49:17] and god is unveiled and that's his word
[1:49:20] may manifest let put this way you can't
[1:49:22] be holy and stay the way you were born
[1:49:25] amen that's one of the greatest traps
[1:49:27] you'll hear today is people say god made
[1:49:28] me this way therefore i should stay this
[1:49:30] way listen we are born liars we are born
[1:49:33] thieves we are born lustful we're born
[1:49:35] selfish we're born weak we're born
[1:49:37] strong we're born rebellious we're born
[1:49:38] proud we're born born boastful we're
[1:49:40] born unthankful
[1:49:43] any of us sitting here saying that
[1:49:44] that's the way god made me
[1:49:47] and yet we'll take other attributes that
[1:49:48] we have and we'll say well god maybe
[1:49:49] that so therefore that's what i'm going
[1:49:51] to be and we don't run it through the
[1:49:52] word amen men are supposed to have
[1:49:54] certain characteristics
[1:49:56] and men are not supposed to have certain
[1:49:58] characteristics amen
[1:49:59] women are supposed to have certain
[1:50:01] characteristics and they're also not
[1:50:02] supposed to have other characteristics
[1:50:04] so if you have something you're not
[1:50:05] supposed to have you don't say god maybe
[1:50:07] this way you say no let me subject it to
[1:50:09] the word and let god do a change in me
[1:50:11] to bring it subject to him because even
[1:50:14] the best things we have
[1:50:16] even the best things we have still have
[1:50:17] to be purified isaiah goes before the
[1:50:19] throne of god and in his presence he
[1:50:21] said i am a man of unclean lips he's
[1:50:23] born a prophet and he says i'm a man of
[1:50:26] unclean lips
[1:50:27] but when the coal of fire touched his
[1:50:29] tongues he says here i am send me
[1:50:31] why he needed the power of the holy
[1:50:33] spirit he need the cleansing fire of god
[1:50:35] to clean the thing that was literally
[1:50:37] built for god to use
[1:50:39] and then from there he could step out
[1:50:41] into his prophetic role but until that
[1:50:43] happened to him he couldn't speak
[1:50:45] amen so whether we have good things or
[1:50:47] bad things we don't get to say this is
[1:50:49] the way god made me no we say lord be it
[1:50:51] unto me according to your word and let
[1:50:53] me be changed into the image that you
[1:50:55] had of me don't let me stay where i am
[1:50:57] but as brother steve was talking about
[1:50:59] let us be transformed into what god has
[1:51:02] called us to be amen there's a
[1:51:04] transformation that we're looking for
[1:51:05] and that's a supernatural thing amen
[1:51:07] brother brad said this he says oh it's
[1:51:09] the new birth they're afraid of that the
[1:51:11] new birth is like any other birth it's a
[1:51:13] mess
[1:51:14] i don't care what kind of birth it is
[1:51:16] it's a mess if it's in a pig pen if it's
[1:51:18] in a barnyard or a pink decorated
[1:51:20] hospital room it's a mess so the new
[1:51:22] birth is a mess
[1:51:23] it'll make you do things you didn't
[1:51:26] think you'd ever do but out of that mess
[1:51:29] comes life he says hallelujah
[1:51:33] it that's it out of a mess comes life
[1:51:35] life comes out of a mess and then he
[1:51:37] says life comes out of death
[1:51:40] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:51:42] ground and die it abides alone but as
[1:51:44] long as it dies and rots then out of
[1:51:46] that rotten mess comes forth life until
[1:51:49] a man or a woman is ready to die to
[1:51:51] themselves die out to their creeds die
[1:51:53] out to their own ideas and out of that
[1:51:55] rotten mess bring forth a new birth of
[1:51:58] glories and shouts and praises of god
[1:52:01] that makes him act different changes his
[1:52:03] nature changes his life changes his
[1:52:06] motives and changes his objectives
[1:52:09] that's a beautiful thing sometimes we
[1:52:11] have a changed life and we're still
[1:52:12] doing things for the wrong reasons he
[1:52:13] says no no let's get the whole package
[1:52:15] here amen
[1:52:17] he says but they're afraid of it afraid
[1:52:19] it'll make them cry and ruin the makeup
[1:52:21] on their face the women afraid it'll
[1:52:23] spoil the appetite of the cigar for the
[1:52:25] man see they're afraid of it they don't
[1:52:27] want it afraid that somebody will call
[1:52:29] them a holy roller or fanatic amen we're
[1:52:32] talking about a holy people here
[1:52:34] he says if they called the master of the
[1:52:36] house beelzebub how much more will they
[1:52:38] call them of his disciples
[1:52:40] sure if they didn't call me that i'd get
[1:52:42] down and pray and say lord what's the
[1:52:44] matter with me
[1:52:46] the world knows its own but you are
[1:52:48] bought with a price you are different
[1:52:51] people a holy people a royal priesthood
[1:52:54] a holy nation and then he says you are a
[1:52:58] kingdom
[1:53:00] you are a kingdom
[1:53:01] you are the kingdom of god so he says
[1:53:03] you've got to be that holy nation you've
[1:53:05] got to be that peculiar people that
[1:53:07] royal priesthood that chosen generation
[1:53:09] amen
[1:53:10] then we're supposed to be what a
[1:53:11] peculiar people brother brahm says this
[1:53:13] he says after the church takes its
[1:53:15] position we're called to the adoption of
[1:53:17] sons by the holy spirit
[1:53:20] and when each man takes his position
[1:53:22] what god has called him to do and stand
[1:53:24] to the end of the road going after the
[1:53:26] lost remember we said we went from be
[1:53:28] fruitful and prosper to go into all the
[1:53:30] world and preach the gospel right every
[1:53:32] man's purpose is to bring in the
[1:53:34] spiritual souls that need to be in the
[1:53:36] kingdom of god that's the only thing
[1:53:38] we've got to do that's our sole purpose
[1:53:40] here is to get the souls into the
[1:53:42] kingdom to find that last seed so we can
[1:53:45] get out of here amen amen right we have
[1:53:47] children
[1:53:48] why because we're trusting they're part
[1:53:50] of that seed right we don't have
[1:53:52] children just to have children we have
[1:53:54] children because we believe that that's
[1:53:55] a child of god and we're bringing the
[1:53:57] child to god into the world amen
[1:53:59] he says
[1:54:00] now first paul takes all the scare out
[1:54:02] of it he says so now if you're called if
[1:54:05] you're not just worked up in your mind
[1:54:07] by some kind of theology
[1:54:09] this message has some kind of theology
[1:54:11] around it doesn't it you want theology
[1:54:13] this message has a ton of theology it
[1:54:14] has a ton of ideas has a ton of doctrine
[1:54:17] you can get so intellectually stimulated
[1:54:19] with this that you won't know what to do
[1:54:20] with yourself amen but he says that's
[1:54:22] not it don't get worked up in it he says
[1:54:25] if you're really born of the spirit then
[1:54:29] god predestinated you before the
[1:54:30] foundation of the world not because you
[1:54:32] heard the message he says if you've had
[1:54:34] that real birth
[1:54:35] put your name on the lamb's book of life
[1:54:38] and now we come together to sit in
[1:54:39] heavenly places in christ jesus a holy
[1:54:42] people a holy nation a peculiar people a
[1:54:46] royal priesthood offering spiritual
[1:54:48] sacrifices unto god that is the fruit of
[1:54:50] our lips giving praises to his name he
[1:54:52] says
[1:54:53] when that's done listen to this he says
[1:54:55] people come in and say them people are
[1:54:58] crazy
[1:55:00] we're crazy if people came in and saw
[1:55:02] what was going on in these services
[1:55:04] they'd say you're crazy
[1:55:06] the very idea of coming in here and
[1:55:08] singing and praising and praying and
[1:55:11] shouting and crying and snotting and
[1:55:14] bubbling and repenting and getting down
[1:55:16] in an altar and shouting and dancing and
[1:55:18] bellowing amen you're crazy and then you
[1:55:21] go out and you live a life and you're
[1:55:23] not chasing the things of the world and
[1:55:24] you don't drink and you don't get
[1:55:26] worried about this and you don't get
[1:55:27] caught up in that and you dress sanely
[1:55:29] you speak sanely your words are good
[1:55:31] your words are kind you you're crazy
[1:55:33] they say you ought to be up in arms you
[1:55:36] ought to be
[1:55:37] you know mad you ought to be frustrated
[1:55:39] with what's going on
[1:55:40] and we sit here and we say
[1:55:42] we're at peace we're at rest brother joe
[1:55:44] was sharing it with a with with a lady
[1:55:47] that he was working with and she was
[1:55:48] talking about all this and he's like
[1:55:50] i'm at rest
[1:55:51] i'm at rest
[1:55:53] i'm not caught up in this i'm not
[1:55:54] worried about my business
[1:55:56] i'm at rest and she's like i wish i had
[1:55:57] that
[1:55:59] but you're crazy brother joe
[1:56:01] you're a crazy man because you believe
[1:56:03] this amen and then people come in and
[1:56:04] say you're crazy them people are crazy
[1:56:07] he says sure they are the wisdom of god
[1:56:11] is foolish to man and the wisdom of man
[1:56:14] is foolish to god they're contrary one
[1:56:17] to the other
[1:56:19] people ought to believe that we're weird
[1:56:20] not because we're weird
[1:56:22] but because we stick to the word the
[1:56:24] word's supposed to make us weird
[1:56:26] listen you look around there's a lot of
[1:56:28] people in the world that are weird for
[1:56:29] the sake of being weird right now you
[1:56:30] got weird haircuts you got weird hair
[1:56:32] colors you got tattoos you got piercing
[1:56:35] you got clothes you got men looking like
[1:56:36] women women looking like men and then
[1:56:38] people looking like nothing
[1:56:40] right you got all sorts of weird out
[1:56:42] there and they're weird for the sake of
[1:56:43] being weird we're not called to be weird
[1:56:44] for the sake of being weird we're called
[1:56:46] to be what weird because we follow the
[1:56:48] word amen
[1:56:49] that's supposed to be our testimonies
[1:56:51] we're weird we're odd because we are
[1:56:53] believers we're a part of that royal
[1:56:54] priesthood amen
[1:56:57] we're called to be different and that
[1:56:59] calling is what makes us peculiar
[1:57:00] because it has an effect on us
[1:57:02] it has an effect on our lives it has an
[1:57:03] effect on our family it has effect on
[1:57:05] our careers has effect on the way we
[1:57:07] spend our time amen
[1:57:09] as we close peter said this
[1:57:11] he says you're our chosen generation a
[1:57:12] royal priesthood a holy nation a
[1:57:14] peculiar people why
[1:57:17] why are we all of this he says that you
[1:57:19] should show forth the praises of him who
[1:57:22] have called you out of darkness in to
[1:57:25] this marvelous light into his marvelous
[1:57:27] light amen the purpose of all of this
[1:57:29] strangeness is to give praise to god
[1:57:32] amen so if what's coming out of our
[1:57:34] lives is not praising god
[1:57:37] then we are not acting according to a
[1:57:39] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[1:57:41] holy nation of peculiar people why
[1:57:43] because god's got to get praise out of
[1:57:45] what we're living god's got to get
[1:57:46] praise out of what we're doing god's got
[1:57:48] to get praise out of how we're acting
[1:57:50] where we're going all these things are
[1:57:51] supposed to bring praise to god
[1:57:53] right and that's the sacrifice not only
[1:57:56] of your lips but your life
[1:57:58] and then so i want to ask you this this
[1:58:00] evening what is it that's coming out of
[1:58:02] your life amen is it the praises of god
[1:58:06] or is it something else
[1:58:08] right
[1:58:09] is it unrest
[1:58:10] is it criticism is it fear
[1:58:14] is it depression
[1:58:15] because that's not what he's looking for
[1:58:17] here he's looking for praise something
[1:58:19] that reflects him that glorifies him
[1:58:21] amen
[1:58:22] so it's going to start where it's got to
[1:58:24] start in the heart
[1:58:26] right of the abundance of the heart a
[1:58:27] man speaketh
[1:58:29] and then out of your mouth has got to
[1:58:30] come words that are what a spiritual
[1:58:33] sacrifice giving praise to god through
[1:58:35] his name
[1:58:36] amen and then out of that it goes into
[1:58:38] action your faith what it what it what
[1:58:40] did james say show me your faith by your
[1:58:43] works
[1:58:43] right faith without works is dead
[1:58:45] brother branham preached amen so all of
[1:58:47] it has to trickle down we can't just be
[1:58:49] great talkers we have to be great
[1:58:50] walkers amen and that's where the
[1:58:52] sacrifice is proven is when we walk the
[1:58:54] way that we say we talk and and that
[1:58:56] talk is supposed to reflect what we
[1:58:58] believe inside ourselves amen amen let's
[1:59:00] all stand together if we would amen
[1:59:03] i want to ask you is your life bringing
[1:59:04] praises to god
[1:59:06] because that's what the royal priesthood
[1:59:07] is doing is they are making a sacrifice
[1:59:09] that brings praise to god and they are
[1:59:11] interceding for the needs of those that
[1:59:13] are around them amen that's what royal
[1:59:15] priesthood looks like this isn't fun and
[1:59:16] games is it
[1:59:17] that that wasn't a a a bunch of fun to
[1:59:20] listen to was it we've got work to do
[1:59:22] and then we've got a role we've got a
[1:59:23] position we've got a responsibility for
[1:59:26] those that are around us amen we're not
[1:59:27] just here to be a christian we're here
[1:59:29] to be a royal priesthood we're here to
[1:59:31] have an effect we're there to stand
[1:59:33] between judgment and those that rightly
[1:59:35] deserve it because what he did it for us
[1:59:37] i'm here because what he stood between
[1:59:40] judgment to me and said i'll take the
[1:59:42] i'll take the price and guess what that
[1:59:44] may mean that you spend many hours on
[1:59:46] your knees
[1:59:47] it may mean that you lose sleep
[1:59:49] because so somebody else can sleep
[1:59:50] soundly right it may mean that you have
[1:59:53] to lose some money it may mean that you
[1:59:55] have to lose a bit of the things that we
[1:59:56] so enjoy so much why because you're
[1:59:58] putting it on the line for somebody that
[2:00:01] needs it more than you and then you're
[2:00:02] taking what he's giving and you're
[2:00:03] saying as he gave for me
[2:00:06] i'm going to give it off to somebody
[2:00:07] else and i'm going to intercede on their
[2:00:08] behalf now i'm going to be a sacrifice
[2:00:10] for them amen god help us
[2:00:13] god help us it's a serious thing amen
[2:00:15] it's tears
[2:00:16] right it's not all happy joy joy and
[2:00:18] dancing around the church in that amen i
[2:00:20] wish it was i wish it was an easy thing
[2:00:22] but it's not it's work it's getting down
[2:00:24] there and it's getting serious with god
[2:00:26] and saying lord i've got a token
[2:00:28] you know you have a token amen you got
[2:00:29] to be able to hold that up and you go to
[2:00:30] him and say i'm bringing the token
[2:00:32] tonight because there's a need for
[2:00:33] somebody that's next to me amen let's
[2:00:36] bow our heads amen
[2:00:39] heavenly father
[2:00:41] lord first and foremost we are so
[2:00:42] thankful that you took our place
[2:00:45] lord that you took that that position
[2:00:47] lord between judgment and us
[2:00:49] lord and you let god take out all of his
[2:00:51] wrath on that body
[2:00:53] lord and in that we have all of those
[2:00:54] redemptive blessings lord that we claim
[2:00:56] for ourselves tonight
[2:00:58] but lord the priesthood doesn't just
[2:01:00] live for itself lord but they're living
[2:01:02] their lives for the needs of others lord
[2:01:04] they're putting others ahead of it
[2:01:05] they're putting lord the the
[2:01:07] requirements lord of your word and
[2:01:08] they're holding them and they're saying
[2:01:10] we're going to go for somebody else or
[2:01:12] we're going to go to bat for them but
[2:01:13] we're going to put our time on the line
[2:01:15] we're going to put our energy on the
[2:01:16] line we're going to put our sleep on the
[2:01:17] line lord we're going to stand in the
[2:01:19] gap for them and trust that the holy
[2:01:21] spirit will bring them into the fold
[2:01:23] that it'll meet the need lord that it'll
[2:01:25] bring somebody into a relationship with
[2:01:27] you
[2:01:27] lord we want that last soul to come in
[2:01:29] because we know when they do the doors
[2:01:31] are shut and we can get out of here
[2:01:32] heavenly father lord may our purpose be
[2:01:35] to bring that last soul in may it be to
[2:01:37] encourage each other lord to hold each
[2:01:39] other before your throne of grace lord
[2:01:41] maybe be quick to take them before the
[2:01:43] throne of mercy lord not of judgment
[2:01:45] help our attitudes lord may our motives
[2:01:47] and our objectives be pure before your
[2:01:49] word heavenly father lord and may it all
[2:01:52] bring praise to your name we pray
[2:01:54] but we ask these things in jesus name
