[47:30] given
[47:31] Lord that it will build our faith for
[47:33] what's coming our way heavenly father
[47:35] and though Lord it may appear to be far
[47:37] in the distance Lord
[47:39] maybe we can't see it can't understand
[47:41] it Lord yet Lord knowing what you've
[47:44] done ought to give us faith that you'll
[47:45] do what you promised you would do
[47:46] heavenly father and Lord we're standing
[47:49] here Lord as testimonies Lord of your
[47:52] grace and your goodness heavenly father
[47:53] and we thank you for it
[47:55] Lord we thank you that you gave your
[47:57] life that we could have it Lord that you
[48:00] gave up the very Breath of Life so that
[48:02] it could come in and inhabit our bodies
[48:04] nor they could take a sword into a life
[48:06] with you Lord that it could draw us into
[48:09] a resurrection and a Rapture Heavenly
[48:11] Father Lord we thank you this morning
[48:13] Lord and as the song says we give you
[48:16] the glory the honor and the praise
[48:20] Lord for It's For Your Glory
[48:22] that we were made in the first place
[48:25] Lord we pray you help us to show it help
[48:28] us to be it Lord help us to personify it
[48:31] each one Lord as individuals
[48:34] Lord that the character the people will
[48:36] be the beauty in this church Lord in

[48:55] knees Lord hold us up Lord let us take

[49:05] Lord speak now we ask in Jesus name
[49:10] and God bless you if you would turn to
[49:12] Exodus 33
[49:15] Exodus 33 amen
[49:17] good to have brother Chad back and
[49:19] sister Leah from their trip trusting
[49:22] God's leadership and blessing there amen
[49:26] I'm certainly grateful for the service
[49:27] the atmosphere this morning
[49:29] song Special by Sister Maureen that was
[49:31] wonderful and
[49:32] just in line with what we'll be speaking
[49:34] about this morning Lord willing
[49:36] and then it can be
[49:38] sometimes when you're in a series and
[49:40] you start to think well we're just
[49:41] following a set path and it's just the
[49:43] way it's going to go but I do believe
[49:45] that God ordains each and every service
[49:48] and he puts things right in the timing
[49:49] that they need to be
[49:51] and he anoints not just the minister to
[49:53] speak it but he anoints the the people
[49:55] to worship and prepare for it and and
[49:57] these different things so I'm trusting
[49:59] his grace and Leadership this morning
[50:03] amen Exodus 33 and verse 12 says this
[50:06] and Moses said unto the Lord
[50:08] see thou sayest unto me bring up this
[50:10] people
[50:11] and thou Hast not let me know whom thou
[50:13] Wilt send with me
[50:15] yet thou has said I Know Thee by name
[50:18] and thou Hast also found Grace in my
[50:20] sight
[50:21] now therefore I pray thee if I have
[50:24] found Grace in thy sight show me now thy
[50:27] way that I may Know Thee that I might
[50:30] find Grace in thy sight and consider
[50:33] that this nation is thy people
[50:35] and he said my presence shall go with
[50:39] thee and I will give thee rest amen God
[50:42] bless you can have your seats this
[50:44] morning
[50:45] and then we are continuing the series on
[50:47] Redemption and I just want to take a
[50:49] single service on this this thought this
[50:52] morning of the promise of his presence
[50:55] amen the promise of his presence and it
[50:58] it stands out to me that Moses was a man
[51:00] that spent a lot of time in the presence
[51:02] of God he was a special man he spoke lip
[51:04] to ear with God as few others did
[51:07] throughout all of scripture and Moses
[51:09] had a covenant with God and Moses had
[51:11] the promises of God and Moses had a
[51:13] burning bush experience and Moses had
[51:15] seen the Redemptive work of God and the
[51:17] power and the signs and the wonders of
[51:19] God and yet we see here that Moses is
[51:21] struggling a little bit and he's saying
[51:23] Lord you've told me to do something and
[51:25] then it doesn't seem like it's obvious
[51:27] what you're going to do you've told me
[51:28] you're going to do something and then
[51:30] nothing's happening and you've told me
[51:32] to call out a people and now you're mad
[51:33] at the people and he's saying I don't
[51:35] know what you want me to do God I don't
[51:37] know where you want me to go I don't
[51:38] understand you say this and then you do
[51:40] that and Lord It's not making sense to
[51:43] me but I want to kind of bring us back
[51:45] to even when they they left Egypt and
[51:48] and kind of set a tone this morning for
[51:50] the leadership and the presence of God
[51:52] in our lives and how he works and in
[51:54] Exodus 23 he's this is this is God right
[51:58] after he left the children of it led the
[52:00] children of Israel out of Egypt and he
[52:01] says behold I send an angel before thee
[52:04] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[52:06] thee into the place which I prepared and
[52:08] I know we spoke on this many times
[52:10] before but I want you to show you the
[52:12] effect of our actions on the presence of
[52:14] God
[52:15] under the law and then under grace and
[52:17] how those things work because you see
[52:19] here that as soon as God takes them out
[52:21] of their bondage out of their slavery
[52:24] out of their habits out of these
[52:25] different things he's ready willing and
[52:27] able right then to lead them he does not
[52:30] free us so that we can just go
[52:32] willy-nilly here or there that we walk
[52:34] out in Freedom and then start to do
[52:35] things of our own choosing but God is
[52:38] waiting right outside the jailhouse if I
[52:40] could put it that way to lead you to
[52:42] where you're supposed to be going and he
[52:44] says to Moses I'll send an angel and we
[52:46] cover before this is not just an angel
[52:48] but this is the Angel this is the
[52:50] capital a angel this is the presence of
[52:52] God this is Christ himself saying I'll
[52:55] go before you and I'll keep you along
[52:57] the way until we get to where we're
[52:59] going and then I'll take you into there
[53:01] as well and that is the promise of God
[53:03] of his presence in our lives is that if
[53:05] I've called you out I'll take you in and
[53:07] I'll be with you from the start to the
[53:09] Finish amen he's there to take us and
[53:12] lead us and we know that Israel followed
[53:14] that Pillar of Fire for months and God
[53:17] said I'll send an angel and that angel
[53:19] was hidden inside that Pillar of Fire
[53:21] that pillar of cloud and it was nothing
[53:22] less than the presence of God himself
[53:24] and it was veiled in front of them and
[53:26] during the day was a pillar of cloud and
[53:28] the presence of God was a shade it had a
[53:31] cooling effect it made their way easier
[53:33] and then at night it was a pillar of
[53:35] fire and it would Center on the day the
[53:37] pillar Cloud would lead them and in the
[53:39] night the pillar fire would Center
[53:40] itself over the camp and it would give
[53:43] them a fiery light so that they could
[53:46] have security and they could rest
[53:47] knowing that nothing could sneak up on
[53:49] them
[53:50] and so the people should have been able
[53:52] to look at that and say no matter where
[53:54] we're going we're not following a man
[53:56] we're following God because the cloud
[53:58] LED them and then the pillar fire stayed
[54:00] in their midst so they didn't have to
[54:02] say what's Moses doing because the cloud
[54:04] was leading
[54:05] doesn't Moses know the way to Canaan we
[54:07] could cut off months if we just headed
[54:09] directly there why are we going this
[54:11] southerly route and these different
[54:12] things but it was God in their midst
[54:15] and right after God destroys the
[54:17] Egyptians he takes them to a mountain to
[54:19] prepare them to worship Him
[54:21] and remember he calls Moses up on the
[54:24] mountain and Moses is gone for 40 days
[54:26] and 40 nights and the people start to
[54:28] what they start to create an excuse as
[54:31] to why they should move on why they
[54:33] don't need to wait and they come to
[54:35] Aaron and they twist his Rubber Arm and
[54:37] they say Aaron Moses is probably dead up
[54:40] there we need a God so fashion us a God
[54:43] and he went and he made them a grave and
[54:45] image he made them the golden calf if
[54:47] you remember and they greatly sinned
[54:49] there
[54:50] and God never forgave them for it
[54:54] it may got a little bit mad if you
[54:56] remember because he came down and he
[54:58] told Moses he says separate from them
[55:00] I'm going to destroy the whole lot
[55:03] under the law your actions had serious
[55:06] consequences
[55:08] under the law you had no hope it was
[55:10] judgment judgment judgment and we see
[55:13] God willing to do that many times but as
[55:15] we see here he caused the plague to fall
[55:18] on the people and many were killed
[55:20] and they lost beloved people there
[55:22] because they didn't wait on God and they
[55:25] tried to get ahead of God and so Moses
[55:27] is coming up and he's standing in the
[55:29] gap
[55:30] Moses was a real Shepherd he stood in
[55:32] the Gap and he said Lord I know there
[55:35] are flawed people
[55:36] I know they have problems I know they
[55:39] make mistakes I know they're unthankful
[55:41] I know they're Unfaithful but God you're
[55:43] the one that called us out
[55:45] you're the one that told us to come this
[55:48] way you're the one that delivered us out
[55:49] of the hands of the Egyptians you're the
[55:51] one that brought us out of slavery so
[55:53] lord it's your calling that brings us
[55:55] here not our own
[55:57] and he reminds God of his own word
[56:00] and if you read these scriptures off
[56:02] times it it seems makes God seem human
[56:05] that he gets mad
[56:06] but that's not the way it is because God
[56:09] has to hold to his own word and when
[56:11] they disobeyed that way then judgment
[56:13] was supposed to be the only thing that
[56:15] they could have and God indeed had to
[56:17] judge them somebody had to pay a price
[56:18] we know these different things but Moses
[56:21] nearly Driven Crazy by the people by
[56:23] their unfaithfulness by their
[56:25] thanklessness their short-term memories
[56:27] their unwillingness to see the
[56:28] supernatural presence of God with them
[56:30] he always stood in the Gap and he always
[56:32] said they're my people and they're your
[56:34] people and you've called them out don't
[56:36] destroy them
[56:38] but Watch What Happens
[56:41] Watch What Happens here it says and the
[56:43] Lord said unto Moses
[56:44] depart up and go up hence thou on the
[56:47] people which thou has brought up out of
[56:49] the land of Egypt under the lamb which I
[56:51] swear unto Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob
[56:53] saying unto thy seed will I give it so
[56:55] Moses convinces God don't kill him
[56:59] God says okay go up
[57:01] but watch the shift here in verse two he
[57:03] says and I will send an angel before
[57:05] thee
[57:06] capital A is gone now it's a little
[57:09] angel now it's just a messenger from God
[57:11] now it's just a different voice it's not
[57:13] the personal presence of God but now
[57:15] he's sent to necessary now he sent
[57:17] somebody to represent him
[57:19] he says and I will drive out the
[57:21] Canaanite the Amorite the hittite the
[57:22] parasite the hivite and the jebusite
[57:24] says I'm still going to do what I said
[57:26] but I'm not going to go with you
[57:29] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[57:31] he says for I will not go up in the
[57:34] midst of thee for thou art a stiff-neck
[57:37] people lest I consume thee in the way so
[57:40] look at the difference here after the
[57:42] people I created and worshiped a false
[57:44] idol God says you'll have Supernatural
[57:46] leadership but it's not going to be me
[57:48] I'll be telling that angel where to take
[57:50] you but I won't be in your midst your
[57:53] stiff neck you're stubborn you never
[57:54] learn you're always whining you're
[57:57] always complaining you always let
[57:58] circumstances dictate your attitude and
[58:00] your approach to me you have short-term
[58:02] memory loss you're never in it for me
[58:04] you're always in it for yourself and you
[58:06] never have the faith that I'm going to
[58:08] take you all the way through
[58:10] he says you've heard me speak you've
[58:12] heard me do signs and wonders in your
[58:13] midst my very personal presence is over
[58:16] you every single day and yet you forget
[58:18] it as soon as circumstances change
[58:22] he said if I stay with you
[58:25] I'll consume you
[58:27] if I stay in the middle of you all
[58:29] you're going to get is Judgment because
[58:30] I know the kind of people you are
[58:32] this isn't a judgment sermon this
[58:34] morning this is under law I'm showing
[58:36] you where what it could be
[58:38] but it's not where we're at but God said
[58:40] I can't stay in the middle of you like
[58:41] this because I've got to stay Sovereign
[58:43] to my law and my law says you've got to
[58:45] be judged and if I'm there I'll judge
[58:47] you immediately
[58:49] but you'll see there's times in the
[58:50] scripture where the people do something
[58:52] and quickly Mo Aaron runs and he gets
[58:54] incense and he stands in the Gap and it
[58:56] holds things back God gives that Gap or
[58:58] that delay to allow for an atonement to
[59:00] allow for a sacrifice to be made to hold
[59:03] off his judgment and that's what that
[59:04] Gap was supposed to do there but God
[59:07] says I'll go I'll be in the land I'll
[59:09] I'll put them out he says but I'm gonna
[59:11] I'm just gonna give an angel to sit to
[59:13] take you along the way here I won't stay
[59:15] in the midst of you anymore
[59:17] we see God's willingness to judge
[59:19] quickly throughout we remember they
[59:20] whined about food and God set them quail
[59:22] and as soon as their their teeth touch
[59:24] the quail then it made them sick
[59:26] and people died in there and then David
[59:28] and Cora stood up and tried to assume a
[59:31] leadership and Authority position and
[59:32] what happened God killed them he killed
[59:34] their families he killed their followers
[59:35] swallowed them up immediately Miriam
[59:37] spoke against Moses and God calls her
[59:39] into his presence and he and he he puts
[59:41] leprosy on her just like that that's the
[59:44] way God said was going to happen if he
[59:46] stayed in the middle of them that way
[59:47] there would be fast and immediate
[59:48] judgment and God didn't even want to do
[59:50] it he says I've got to separate myself
[59:52] from you I'm glad we're not under the
[59:54] law
[59:56] I'm glad we're not under the law church
[59:57] but it behooves us to be thankful is my
[59:59] other point I know I read this the other
[1:00:01] day but I want to say it again in first
[1:00:03] Thessalonians Paul said in everything
[1:00:05] give thanks for this is the will of God
[1:00:08] in Christ Jesus concerning you and
[1:00:11] that's the lesson the children of Israel
[1:00:13] never learn they never learn to give
[1:00:15] thanks because God was with them no
[1:00:17] matter what
[1:00:18] and that's as mature Believers
[1:00:20] especially what we're supposed to do
[1:00:21] we're supposed to recognize that God has
[1:00:23] created a path of life for us
[1:00:25] it's a program and everyone's program is
[1:00:28] a little different each one of those
[1:00:30] programs Falls in line with the word of
[1:00:31] God but yet God does things differently
[1:00:33] and he deals with us differently he
[1:00:35] deals with us as we are and he's got a
[1:00:37] path or a program laid out for us and
[1:00:39] sometimes it's hard and painful and
[1:00:41] sometimes it's fun and enjoyable
[1:00:43] but no matter what whether it feels good
[1:00:46] or whether it feels bad yet it is God's
[1:00:48] path and program for us and we're
[1:00:49] supposed to be able to give thanks no
[1:00:51] matter what's going on in those
[1:00:52] situations amen listen the good times
[1:00:54] and the bad times are both equally of
[1:00:57] God
[1:00:58] it's all him it's all him no matter what
[1:01:02] it looks like no matter what it feels
[1:01:03] like
[1:01:04] but God said listen I can't stay in the
[1:01:06] midst of you anymore otherwise it'll be
[1:01:07] bad for you and he withdrew himself for
[1:01:10] their sake can you imagine that because
[1:01:12] his presence was going to be judgment if
[1:01:14] he stayed in the midst of them so watch
[1:01:16] what happens after God says this
[1:01:18] says that Moses took the Tabernacle and
[1:01:21] pitched it without the camp so he took
[1:01:24] up the the Tabernacle that this was the
[1:01:26] the temporary Tabernacle and he takes it
[1:01:29] and he moves it outside of the camp
[1:01:30] because it used to be the Tabernacle was
[1:01:32] in the midst of the people
[1:01:34] God's supposed to dwell in the midst of
[1:01:36] the people
[1:01:37] but God said I can't be there so Moses
[1:01:39] takes a tabernacle he moves it outside
[1:01:40] the camp afar off from the camp and
[1:01:43] called it the Tabernacle of the
[1:01:45] congregation and it came to pass that
[1:01:47] everyone which sought the Lord went out
[1:01:49] into the Tabernacle of the congregation
[1:01:51] which was without the camp catch us now
[1:01:54] what is it it's an individual affair
[1:01:58] now if you want God you got to go get
[1:02:00] God
[1:02:01] you can't just be associated with a
[1:02:03] message of redemption you can't just be
[1:02:04] associated with the message of
[1:02:06] Deliverance but you've got to go to the
[1:02:07] god of that Deliverance you've got to go
[1:02:09] to the god of the earth that Redemption
[1:02:10] and you've got to separate yourself from
[1:02:12] the unbelief and go in one-on-one with
[1:02:15] God and say God I'm here to talk to you
[1:02:17] that's the requirement today is after
[1:02:19] after God separates and we see it even
[1:02:22] in Revelation 3 he says behold I stand
[1:02:24] at the door knock he's outside of
[1:02:26] everything and you've got to be the one
[1:02:28] that goes to meet him you've got to be
[1:02:29] the one that lets him in it's got to be
[1:02:31] an individual Affair you had to leave
[1:02:33] the unbelievers and come to God
[1:02:34] individually
[1:02:36] verse 8 it says and it came to pass when
[1:02:38] Moses went out into the Tabernacle that
[1:02:40] all the people rose up and stood every
[1:02:42] man at his tent door and looked after
[1:02:44] after Moses until he was gone into the
[1:02:47] Tabernacle and it came to pass as Moses
[1:02:49] entered the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar
[1:02:52] descended and stood at the door of the
[1:02:54] Tabernacle and the Lord talked with
[1:02:56] Moses
[1:02:57] so now God drops down but he's outside
[1:02:59] the camp and he's only going to talk to
[1:03:01] his prophet
[1:03:02] it says in all the people saw the Cloudy
[1:03:04] pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and
[1:03:07] all the people rose up and worshiped
[1:03:09] every man in his tent door as I read
[1:03:12] that I thought if they could stand and
[1:03:14] worship because they saw the far distant
[1:03:16] presence of God what about that to do in
[1:03:18] our midst
[1:03:19] amen if we know that he's with us if we
[1:03:22] know that he's here if we know that he's
[1:03:24] promised to be in our midst and what
[1:03:26] ought that to do with our worship if
[1:03:27] they could worship seeing God maybe a
[1:03:29] kilometer away from the camp what ought
[1:03:31] that to do when we know he's in our very
[1:03:33] midst this morning amen what is it that
[1:03:35] could ever hold back our worship and our
[1:03:36] praise when he's with us all along amen
[1:03:39] when we know that he'll never leave us
[1:03:40] or forsake us verse 11 says in the Lord
[1:03:43] spake unto Moses face to face as a man
[1:03:46] speaketh unto his friend and he turned
[1:03:48] again unto the camp but his servant
[1:03:51] Joshua the son of none a young man
[1:03:52] departed not out of the Tabernacle I
[1:03:55] want you to notice Joshua's what he's
[1:03:57] going to be the next leader
[1:03:59] and God has chosen Joshua to be the one
[1:04:02] that's going to take them into the land
[1:04:03] and Joshua sees Moses leave the presence
[1:04:06] but Joshua stays there why
[1:04:08] because Joshua wants to stay in the
[1:04:10] presence of God
[1:04:12] striking so often that you know it will
[1:04:14] come to the end of a service and and we
[1:04:16] boot it right out the door
[1:04:19] and my question is why are we inclined
[1:04:21] to leave so quickly when the presence of
[1:04:22] the Lord is here and when he's moving in
[1:04:24] his Blessing listen sometimes he may not
[1:04:26] be working with you but when you see
[1:04:28] somebody else is working on we ought to
[1:04:29] stay here and we ought to pray and set
[1:04:31] an atmosphere and hold that person
[1:04:33] before the throne of grace amen our
[1:04:35] desire should be to be where the
[1:04:37] presence of God is most strongly felt
[1:04:39] amen so when we're in here I encourage
[1:04:41] you stick around
[1:04:43] pray worship praise after the service
[1:04:46] when God's moving don't hold back
[1:04:49] when God has made himself known then
[1:04:51] jump in jump in while the waters are
[1:04:53] stirred amen get the blessing while the
[1:04:56] blessings available because guess what
[1:04:58] it's going to be harder and harder to
[1:04:59] get into the presence of God I do
[1:05:01] believe because Satan is pressing more
[1:05:03] and more into this Earth and so that
[1:05:05] means the presence of God is going to be
[1:05:06] pushed more and more out of our daily
[1:05:07] lives not our lives but out of
[1:05:10] everything that's around us and we're
[1:05:11] going to be more and more isolated we
[1:05:13] need to get strength while strength is
[1:05:14] here we need to enjoy the presence of
[1:05:16] God while he's here amen
[1:05:19] and Moses said unto the Lord see thou
[1:05:22] say a son to me bring up this people and
[1:05:24] thou has not let me know whom thou will
[1:05:26] send with me yet thou has said I Know
[1:05:29] Thee by name and thou has found Grace in
[1:05:31] my sight so Moses is saying Lord you've
[1:05:34] told me to bring out a people and then
[1:05:36] you said that you're going to depart
[1:05:37] from us and then you said we're going
[1:05:39] into Canaan Lord I feel like we're in
[1:05:42] limbo here
[1:05:44] it's like we're being blessed and cursed
[1:05:46] at the same time you said you know us by
[1:05:48] name you said we found Grace in your
[1:05:50] sight but yet I'm having to go outside
[1:05:52] the camp the people have to go outside
[1:05:53] the camp to be with you what's going on
[1:05:56] he's saying Lord I don't know what to do
[1:05:58] with what you're saying you're giving me
[1:06:00] mixed signals I don't know what to make
[1:06:01] of this situation
[1:06:04] so Moses says now therefore I pray thee
[1:06:06] if I have found Grace in thy sight show
[1:06:10] me now thy way that I may Know Thee that
[1:06:13] I may find Grace in thy sight and
[1:06:15] consider that this nation is thy people
[1:06:19] listen Moses knows he's called to lead
[1:06:21] the people so he said Lord if I don't
[1:06:23] have Clarity of Direction then the
[1:06:25] people aren't going to have Clarity
[1:06:26] either so he says Lord show me your way
[1:06:29] and if you go into the Amplified he says
[1:06:31] show me your way that I may know you
[1:06:33] better that I may draw closer to you so
[1:06:36] that as I get closer to you your
[1:06:39] leadership becomes perfected through me
[1:06:41] and that I can lead the people as you
[1:06:43] meant me to lead them he's saying Lord
[1:06:45] get me close to you so that I can help
[1:06:47] them get close to you as well so that I
[1:06:49] can keep them in your will so that I can
[1:06:51] keep them in your way because if I fall
[1:06:54] they're going to fall as well
[1:06:56] so he said Lord first do it in me
[1:06:59] Lord first do it in me
[1:07:01] and that way the people can be helped
[1:07:03] and they can be held where you want them
[1:07:04] to but as I was looking at this I was
[1:07:07] talking with my wife the other day about
[1:07:09] this
[1:07:10] it's not wrong
[1:07:12] to ask God for clarification
[1:07:15] it's not wrong to say Lord I don't
[1:07:17] understand
[1:07:19] sometimes and I don't know about you but
[1:07:21] sometimes you make it you're facing a
[1:07:24] decision and it can look like there's
[1:07:25] two roads that you can take and both of
[1:07:28] them will be right
[1:07:29] but I believe there is always a single
[1:07:32] perfect will of God
[1:07:34] but sometimes it looks like there's two
[1:07:36] ways I write and you say Lord I don't
[1:07:37] know what to do each of them seems okay
[1:07:40] by the word and I'm not really against
[1:07:42] one or for the other it seems like
[1:07:44] there's two ways we could go here and
[1:07:46] you can say Lord what is your will and
[1:07:48] your way because it seems like I can't
[1:07:49] determine it right now what do I do in
[1:07:52] this situation what do I do with these
[1:07:53] this person what do I do with this
[1:07:55] relationship what what way do I go Lord
[1:07:58] I don't know what to do because it seems
[1:08:00] like you're okay with both but we know
[1:08:02] there's always a perfect will
[1:08:04] there's always a perfect will
[1:08:06] we were talking about Mary when Gabriel
[1:08:09] comes to her and he says you're going to
[1:08:11] have a child and it's going to be the
[1:08:12] Messiah
[1:08:13] and she says to the angel how can this
[1:08:15] thing be seen I know not a man she says
[1:08:18] I've never been intimate with the man so
[1:08:20] how is this going to be she wasn't
[1:08:21] asking in doubt or from a lack of faith
[1:08:24] but she was saying Lord angel I don't
[1:08:26] understand Gabriel I don't understand
[1:08:28] how this is going to happen
[1:08:31] and what did he say he said the Holy
[1:08:33] Spirit shall overshadow thee now that
[1:08:36] was an answer but that probably didn't
[1:08:38] give her a whole lot of understanding
[1:08:41] because I doubt that Mary knew the
[1:08:43] moment she got pregnant but yet it
[1:08:45] happened but he said here's how it's
[1:08:47] going to happen is it's going to be a
[1:08:48] holy spirit anointing that's going to
[1:08:50] make the life come to that there that's
[1:08:52] going to bring a life inside of you he
[1:08:54] gave her the answer
[1:08:55] when she said can you can you clarify
[1:08:57] what you're talking about can you tell
[1:08:59] me how this sort of thing is going to
[1:09:00] happen
[1:09:01] but Moses says
[1:09:03] Lord
[1:09:05] I need to be closer to you and I need
[1:09:07] you to show me your way
[1:09:09] and watch how God answers Moses because
[1:09:11] God doesn't tell Moses yeah I'll show
[1:09:14] you my way watch what he says he said
[1:09:18] my presence shall go with thee and I
[1:09:23] will give thee rest
[1:09:25] did he say Moses I'm going to tell you
[1:09:27] before hand every step you're supposed
[1:09:29] to make I'm going to tell you what
[1:09:31] happened I'm going to tell you what to
[1:09:32] watch out for I'm going to lay out the
[1:09:34] whole Plan of Redemption in front of you
[1:09:36] Moses so that you know the beginning to
[1:09:38] the end and you can have full confidence
[1:09:40] did he say that
[1:09:43] no he didn't he said I'll go with you
[1:09:46] that's God's answer to every situation
[1:09:49] is I will be with you and you'll know my
[1:09:51] will because you'll be with me my will
[1:09:54] is where I am my will is where my
[1:09:56] presence is my will is where my word is
[1:09:58] so if you stay with me you'll know my
[1:10:01] will
[1:10:02] I'll be with you Moses and I will give
[1:10:05] you rest for every moment my presence
[1:10:08] will bring rest my presence will bring
[1:10:09] peace my presence will bring assurance
[1:10:12] and that's where you're going to have to
[1:10:14] rest Moses I'm not going to tell you
[1:10:16] everything listen what happens when God
[1:10:19] tells us everything
[1:10:21] we try and get ahead of him
[1:10:23] the problem when we know too much is
[1:10:25] that we try and make it happen brother
[1:10:27] Branham would talk about that gift and
[1:10:29] he'd have the visions and he said you
[1:10:31] know before I could pray or before
[1:10:33] anything would happen a certain hat had
[1:10:35] to be here and this had to be there and
[1:10:37] brother random could maybe see where
[1:10:39] that cloak or that cat was and he could
[1:10:41] have gone and moved it
[1:10:43] but he knew that that was not why God
[1:10:46] gives Insight so that you can make it
[1:10:48] happen but brother Brown said as soon as
[1:10:49] somebody came and put that hat there
[1:10:51] then I knew that I could move forward
[1:10:53] because God had shown me but brother
[1:10:55] Branham learned to hold back and let it
[1:10:57] develop on its own
[1:10:59] but most of us don't have that sort of
[1:11:01] patience and we don't have that
[1:11:02] character to just hold on and say all
[1:11:04] right Lord you've given me Insight I
[1:11:05] won't try and force the issue I won't
[1:11:07] try and make it happen amen why because
[1:11:09] this is a walk of Faith Church it's
[1:11:11] always a walk of faith we've got to be
[1:11:14] able to trust when we can't see we've
[1:11:16] got to be able to trust because he's
[1:11:18] here not because we see so far down the
[1:11:20] road amen so God didn't say to Moses
[1:11:23] I'll show you my way now he said I'll
[1:11:25] show you my way as we go by Leading you
[1:11:28] along the way
[1:11:29] that's his answer his answer is my
[1:11:32] presence will go with you Moses and
[1:11:34] that's how you're going to get closer to
[1:11:35] me
[1:11:36] I'll be a constant presence I'll be a
[1:11:38] constant peace I'll be a constant Joy
[1:11:40] I'll be a constant leader I'll be there
[1:11:42] constantly Moses and that's what you're
[1:11:45] going to have to rest in amen
[1:11:47] I said it before I think the greatest
[1:11:49] attribute for a Believer is rest
[1:11:51] it's rest
[1:11:53] listen if Christ could sleep in the
[1:11:55] storm that was about to sink the ship
[1:11:58] then what we ought to be able to do when
[1:12:00] things are going so poorly when we're
[1:12:02] uncertain when things don't look like
[1:12:03] there's a a clear path we ought to be
[1:12:05] able to say Lord I'm resting Lord I'm
[1:12:08] trusting Lord I'm believing Lord I am
[1:12:11] persuaded that because you are in the
[1:12:13] ship with me everything's going to turn
[1:12:16] out okay Lord as long as you're with me
[1:12:18] then I know it's all going to be okay no
[1:12:20] matter which way it goes it's all going
[1:12:22] to be acceptable it's always going to be
[1:12:23] good it's always going to be for my good
[1:12:26] Romans 8 says this he says for as many
[1:12:29] as are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:12:31] the sons of God for ye have not received
[1:12:34] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:12:36] ye have received the spirit of adoption
[1:12:38] whereby we cry Abba Father that word
[1:12:41] ABBA is is indicative of a close
[1:12:44] relationship
[1:12:45] it's not it's not the baby Dada thing
[1:12:48] I hear that preach so many times but
[1:12:50] that's not it I think I've even preached
[1:12:52] it but as I was I was studying into it
[1:12:54] it's that it indicates that you are
[1:12:56] familiar with them
[1:12:59] that you have close relationship with
[1:13:01] him and that's why you can call him Abba
[1:13:04] he says you can come because you have a
[1:13:07] closeness you can come because you have
[1:13:09] a relationship and whatever you ask I
[1:13:11] hear you
[1:13:12] and I'm always available to listen to
[1:13:14] you
[1:13:15] that's what kind of a spirit he's given
[1:13:17] us by the holy spirit is one that can
[1:13:18] come and say Dad
[1:13:20] I'm in need
[1:13:21] father I'm in need
[1:13:24] and he's there and he hears us every
[1:13:25] single time it says the spirit itself
[1:13:28] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:13:30] are the children of God
[1:13:33] now after God says this to Moses I love
[1:13:35] Moses response because he said he said
[1:13:38] my presence will go with thee and I will
[1:13:40] give thee rest and Moses says and he
[1:13:42] said unto him Moses said unto him If thy
[1:13:45] presence go not with me carry us not up
[1:13:48] hence
[1:13:49] church if we could lay hold of this one
[1:13:51] idea this morning Lord if you're not
[1:13:54] with me don't send me out
[1:13:57] listen
[1:13:58] if you're going to sing a special be
[1:14:01] anointed
[1:14:02] if you're going to pray be anointed if
[1:14:04] you're going to preach be anointed
[1:14:05] whatever it is say Lord if you're not
[1:14:07] with me there's no point to me stepping
[1:14:10] up there there's no point to me sitting
[1:14:12] behind that piano there's no point in me
[1:14:13] getting behind that microphone because
[1:14:15] you're the Difference Maker you're the
[1:14:18] one that makes it happen Lord
[1:14:22] church it's not us
[1:14:24] we have no power in ourselves
[1:14:27] it's him and us
[1:14:30] that's the hope of our glorious Christ
[1:14:31] inside of us
[1:14:34] oh that song says without him
[1:14:37] I could do nothing
[1:14:40] without him I'd surely fail
[1:14:43] without him I will be drifting like a
[1:14:45] ship without a sail
[1:14:47] Moses knew that God in their midst was
[1:14:50] the Difference Maker
[1:14:51] that's the difference this morning for
[1:14:53] us Church the difference for us is not
[1:14:55] that we have an end time message the
[1:14:57] difference for us is not that we have an
[1:14:59] identified group of Believers but the
[1:15:01] difference for us is that Christ is in
[1:15:03] our midst and if we ever put him out if
[1:15:06] we ever put him out we are no different
[1:15:08] than anybody else
[1:15:10] you can have this message and never have
[1:15:12] him in your midst and you will go the
[1:15:14] same way of a denomination he in our
[1:15:16] midst is the Difference Maker and Moses
[1:15:18] knew it Moses knew from 40 Years of
[1:15:21] making a mess up in in Egypt and killing
[1:15:23] somebody and having to flee he knew that
[1:15:25] he would fail every single time but as
[1:15:28] soon as he had a burning bush experience
[1:15:29] as soon as he had a commission where God
[1:15:31] said I'll go with you as long as you do
[1:15:34] this that was the Difference Maker in
[1:15:36] Moses life and he was never the same
[1:15:37] after that amen church it's got to be
[1:15:40] God or all the way through or it's never
[1:15:43] God at all there is no such thing as 90
[1:15:45] percent God it's got to be all him or
[1:15:48] none him listen sometimes we we get into
[1:15:51] things and we presume that because we
[1:15:53] have a gift or because we have a calling
[1:15:54] that we can just go do things and God
[1:15:56] will bless it no we're supposed to be
[1:15:58] led we're supposed to be inspired we're
[1:16:01] supposed to be given an unction we're
[1:16:02] supposed to be directed to do things
[1:16:05] and I can say for myself there have been
[1:16:07] times where I've presumed on his calling
[1:16:09] and not sought his perfect will or not
[1:16:12] gotten his motive and objective and he's
[1:16:13] left me hanging out in the wind because
[1:16:15] I presumed
[1:16:17] because I presume that he would go with
[1:16:19] me no I've got to wait on him I've got
[1:16:22] to wait on him and we have to do the
[1:16:24] same thing amen
[1:16:26] Moses the greatest prophet in the Old
[1:16:28] Testament I don't think it's I don't
[1:16:30] think anybody can dispute it the
[1:16:31] greatest prophet in the Old Testament
[1:16:33] listen if Christ was modeled after Moses
[1:16:34] to me that makes Moses the greatest
[1:16:36] prophet in the Old Testament
[1:16:39] he learned that without God he was a
[1:16:40] failure
[1:16:41] and if that goes for him it goes for
[1:16:43] each and every one of us amen
[1:16:45] listen to this brother Bradham says this
[1:16:47] he says those Brethren that came out of
[1:16:50] Pentecost up there they were convinced
[1:16:52] that he was all they needed and they
[1:16:56] were convinced that that's all the
[1:16:57] people needed was him
[1:17:00] we're talking about his promise of his
[1:17:03] presence this morning he says when
[1:17:05] people came out of Pentecost up there
[1:17:07] what came out of what the upper room
[1:17:10] what did they preach
[1:17:12] they preach you can have what I have
[1:17:14] this is that this is what you need
[1:17:17] and I'm convinced the same thing he says
[1:17:19] they don't just tell me I have to speak
[1:17:21] better and have to do this and do that
[1:17:23] and stand still behind the pulpit he
[1:17:25] says that's psychology you say well the
[1:17:27] better class of people attend he said
[1:17:30] God's class of people will attend it he
[1:17:32] works on both ends of the line remember
[1:17:34] the Common People heard Christ gladly
[1:17:38] I'm convinced that the people don't need
[1:17:40] a great big long string of this that or
[1:17:42] the other I'm convinced because I know
[1:17:44] what it did for me and I'm convinced
[1:17:47] it'll do the same for them yes sir I'm
[1:17:49] convinced that he will meet all their
[1:17:51] needs I'm convinced that he will meet
[1:17:53] all others needs
[1:17:54] he said I was reading the other day of
[1:17:56] Hudson Taylor many of you read of him
[1:17:59] the great missionary to China there was
[1:18:01] a young man come to him one day a boy
[1:18:03] about 14 15 years old he said Mr Taylor
[1:18:06] I believe I have a call in my life to be
[1:18:08] a minister when I get to be about 25
[1:18:10] years old he said you know what I'm
[1:18:12] coming to join your school and I want to
[1:18:14] learn
[1:18:16] Mr Taylor the Christian gentleman said
[1:18:18] Son don't wait till the candles have
[1:18:20] burned down go when it's lit that's
[1:18:23] right you don't need no schooling of
[1:18:25] this and schooling of that you say well
[1:18:27] the candles just yet lit yes when it's
[1:18:30] lit well I don't know in ethiology you
[1:18:32] don't need to know go tell them how it
[1:18:34] got lit and maybe it'll light them
[1:18:37] he says what we need is a candle
[1:18:40] lighting time the power of the Holy
[1:18:41] Ghost instead of so much of this
[1:18:43] man-made dogma and Theological training
[1:18:46] I'm convinced that's what the people
[1:18:48] need whether he knows his ABCs or not
[1:18:50] whether he knows beans from spit split
[1:18:53] coffee if he will just let that candle
[1:18:55] get lit God will take care of the rest
[1:18:58] he says that's right I'm convinced that
[1:19:00] all that's all that he needs
[1:19:03] listen sometimes up here we preach deep
[1:19:05] things we get into the depths of the
[1:19:08] word and the depths of the Mysteries and
[1:19:09] that's wonderful
[1:19:10] and then some days we're preaching where
[1:19:12] the rubber meets the road in our lives
[1:19:14] and it's a simple basic things that keep
[1:19:16] us in our Christian walk and that keep
[1:19:18] us faithful to God Amen but when it
[1:19:21] comes to converting people the greatest
[1:19:23] thing the most powerful thing we can do
[1:19:25] is tell them what God's done for us
[1:19:27] listen there is no law against a
[1:19:29] testimony brother or sister
[1:19:31] you go to somebody and you tell them
[1:19:33] what God did for you what does it do it
[1:19:36] gives them a hope that they can get the
[1:19:37] same thing because the greatest thing
[1:19:39] you can say after what you say what God
[1:19:41] did for you is you say he can do the
[1:19:42] same thing for you
[1:19:44] it's an offer that they can have the
[1:19:45] same experience that you did amen
[1:19:48] that's what people are looking for
[1:19:49] they're looking for something that's
[1:19:50] real they're looking for something
[1:19:51] that's solid they're looking for
[1:19:53] something that's proven and so when they
[1:19:55] look at your life and they see what
[1:19:57] proof of something stable and real then
[1:19:59] then maybe that's an opportunity for
[1:20:01] them to come in and then they don't turn
[1:20:03] down the mystery then they don't turn
[1:20:05] down the doctrine because yours works
[1:20:06] more than theirs works
[1:20:08] yours does what theirs won't listen sit
[1:20:11] down with a trinitarian sometime and try
[1:20:13] and convince some of the godhead you
[1:20:15] won't get anywhere
[1:20:17] but you sit down you tell them what
[1:20:19] God's doing in your life that he's not
[1:20:20] doing in theirs maybe they'll listen
[1:20:22] listen we can't argue somebody into a
[1:20:25] conversion but if you can show them a
[1:20:27] life that's beyond what they have that's
[1:20:28] going to do something for them that your
[1:20:30] words never will otherwise amen
[1:20:32] listen I look around this congregation
[1:20:34] and from The Young to the old we've got
[1:20:36] people that can speak of and testify of
[1:20:38] the of the the healing of God of the
[1:20:40] Deliverance of God of the provision of
[1:20:42] God of the sailing saving of God of
[1:20:45] picking you up out of a crowd out of a
[1:20:47] family out of everybody and just
[1:20:49] reaching down with one finger and
[1:20:50] pulling you out
[1:20:51] from The Young to the old and we may be
[1:20:53] at different levels but we all have a
[1:20:54] reality of God in our lives and so
[1:20:56] whether it's our young brothers and
[1:20:57] sisters while they're at work whether
[1:20:59] it's the middle aged ones or the old
[1:21:01] ones wherever it might be I believe we
[1:21:03] have a testimony we can share with
[1:21:04] people of the reality of a living God
[1:21:06] today that's what people are looking for
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:11] Moses continues
[1:21:13] he says for wherein shall it be known he
[1:21:16] says listen if you don't go with us then
[1:21:18] don't even send us up he says wherein
[1:21:20] shall it be known here that I and thy
[1:21:22] people have found Grace in thy sight he
[1:21:24] says how how are we gonna how are we
[1:21:26] gonna know how are the people gonna know
[1:21:27] that we found Grace in your sight he
[1:21:29] says is it not that thou goest with us
[1:21:31] in other words he says is not the sign
[1:21:33] of your grace your presence in our midst
[1:21:35] he says that's the only thing that
[1:21:37] separates us he says so shall we be
[1:21:39] separated I and thy people from all the
[1:21:41] children that are upon the face of the
[1:21:44] Earth
[1:21:45] as I said before the differentiator
[1:21:46] between the true children of God and
[1:21:49] everyone else is that God is with his
[1:21:50] children
[1:21:52] that's it and Moses is saying the only
[1:21:54] thing that separates us from the
[1:21:56] Hittites and the jebusites and all of
[1:21:58] these other things is that you're with
[1:21:59] us because without you we'd just slip
[1:22:02] and fall right into exactly what they're
[1:22:03] doing listen they'd already done it
[1:22:05] they'd already done it if you think
[1:22:07] about it they had already gone and
[1:22:09] worshiped idols
[1:22:10] already done what everybody else did but
[1:22:12] the only thing that would keep them in
[1:22:13] the way was if that presence was in
[1:22:15] their midst amen and if our and we're
[1:22:18] the same thing if you take God out of
[1:22:19] our midst Church were no different than
[1:22:21] any other denomination we're no
[1:22:22] different listen we're no different than
[1:22:24] somebody that doesn't even believe in
[1:22:25] God if God is not in our midst
[1:22:28] because it's what it's a false front
[1:22:30] it's not even a reality it's dead
[1:22:31] religion and dead religion is worse than
[1:22:34] no religion
[1:22:36] the emperor has no clothes amen
[1:22:38] that's what we're looking at
[1:22:40] he says Moses said God we know we found
[1:22:43] Grace if you go with us because that's
[1:22:44] the only thing that's going to keep us
[1:22:46] in the way
[1:22:48] and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:22:50] I will do this thing also that thou has
[1:22:52] spoken for thou has found Grace in my
[1:22:55] sight and I Know Thee by name
[1:23:00] he says you found Grace in my sight
[1:23:01] that's a wonderful thing but he says I
[1:23:03] know you by name
[1:23:05] I want to dwell on that I know you by
[1:23:07] name this morning
[1:23:09] listen when Moses was standing in the
[1:23:11] gap for the people this is what he said
[1:23:13] to God he says yet now if thou Wilt
[1:23:15] forgive their sin he's saying Lord
[1:23:17] forgive the people forgive the people
[1:23:19] but he says if not block me I pray thee
[1:23:22] out of thy book which thou has written
[1:23:25] we tend to look at this idea of the book
[1:23:27] of life being something that's really
[1:23:28] only revealed in Revelation but Moses is
[1:23:31] a prophet knew there was a book written
[1:23:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:23:34] he says God if you don't forgive the
[1:23:36] people he says then you might as well
[1:23:37] wipe my name off because I'm attached to
[1:23:39] them you commissioned me to take them
[1:23:41] you commissioned me to Shepherd them you
[1:23:43] commission me to lead them in the way
[1:23:44] that you told me to lead them he says so
[1:23:46] if you destroy them you might as well
[1:23:48] destroy me because I'm attached to them
[1:23:49] they're what I'm bringing to you in the
[1:23:51] first place
[1:23:52] now we know this book that he speaks of
[1:23:54] is the Lamb's Book of Life and in
[1:23:56] Revelation it says he that overcometh
[1:23:58] the same shall be clothed in white
[1:24:00] raiment and I will not blot his name out
[1:24:02] of the book of life but I will confess
[1:24:04] his name before my father and before his
[1:24:06] angels so notice there's a book of life
[1:24:09] and there's everyone's names are in it
[1:24:11] but some can be blotted out some can be
[1:24:13] marked out
[1:24:15] and some will have to be left in there
[1:24:17] others can't be removed and we'll see
[1:24:18] that in a moment because they're there
[1:24:20] by predestination and the foreknowledge
[1:24:22] of God
[1:24:23] in Revelation 17 8 it says the Beast
[1:24:25] that thou saws was and is not and shall
[1:24:27] Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[1:24:29] into Perdition and they that dwell on
[1:24:31] the Earth shall wonder whose names were
[1:24:33] not written in the Book of Life from the
[1:24:35] foundation of the world when they behold
[1:24:38] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[1:24:40] so there are names on the book and then
[1:24:43] he says there's names that were on the
[1:24:44] book before the foundation of the world
[1:24:47] and he says the ones whose babes are on
[1:24:49] the on the book before the foundation of
[1:24:51] the world they can't fall into a false
[1:24:53] worship
[1:24:54] they're going to be held all the way to
[1:24:55] the end
[1:24:58] and then speaking of a new Heaven and a
[1:24:59] new Earth in Revelation 21 he says and
[1:25:02] there shall in no wise enter into it
[1:25:04] anything that defileth nor what neither
[1:25:07] whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh
[1:25:10] a lie but they which are written in the
[1:25:12] Lamb's Book of Life you notice sometimes
[1:25:15] it says Book of Life and sometimes it
[1:25:16] says Lamb's Book of Life they asked
[1:25:18] brother Branham after the seals they
[1:25:19] said is that two books he says no it's
[1:25:21] the same book
[1:25:23] but it's like and this is my words now
[1:25:25] but the Lamb's Book of Life is Like a
[1:25:27] chapter inside the book of life and in
[1:25:29] that chapter the names are there and
[1:25:31] they're always there they were there
[1:25:32] written before the foundation of the
[1:25:34] world by the written in the blood of the
[1:25:36] Lamb that was slain before the
[1:25:37] foundation of the world and those names
[1:25:38] can never be removed and that's the ones
[1:25:41] that he's coming for
[1:25:42] that's the ones he's coming for those
[1:25:44] are the ones whose names are engraved in
[1:25:45] the palm of his hands amen and that's
[1:25:47] this is the people he says that are
[1:25:49] going to inherit the new Heaven and the
[1:25:51] new Earth
[1:25:52] those are the redeemed not just the
[1:25:54] saved the book of life is all the same
[1:25:57] but the Lamb's Book of Life is the
[1:25:58] redeemed
[1:26:00] we're talking about this and and we talk
[1:26:02] about he says I Know Thee by name and
[1:26:04] then he says I will give thee rest and
[1:26:05] then he says you found Grace in my sight
[1:26:07] and what we see there is a beautiful
[1:26:09] picture of what Redemption
[1:26:11] Redemption because Redemption is always
[1:26:13] a Grace work
[1:26:15] and it's related to your name because
[1:26:17] you have to be what you have to be a
[1:26:18] relative to that one and then it's what
[1:26:21] to bring you to rest bring you back to
[1:26:22] your place in your position
[1:26:24] we know that everyone that says they're
[1:26:25] a Believer is not always a believer
[1:26:28] many will say in that day Lord Lord have
[1:26:29] we not done this and that he says depart
[1:26:31] from me you that work iniquity I never
[1:26:33] knew you but there are those whose names
[1:26:35] are in the book and those are the
[1:26:36] redeemed and those are the ones he's
[1:26:38] coming for and he says you found Grace
[1:26:40] and that's why I'm coming back for you
[1:26:41] that's why I'll be in your midst it's
[1:26:43] because your names are in the book you
[1:26:45] are the purchase you're the chosen
[1:26:46] you're the elected seed of God Amen
[1:26:49] we see Moses saying God you know him you
[1:26:52] say you know me my name you say you know
[1:26:54] us by name but without your presence it
[1:26:56] means nothing to us
[1:26:57] he says God you've got to be with us
[1:27:01] we've got to have that same idea today
[1:27:05] that he's got to be with us
[1:27:07] that the message without the god of the
[1:27:09] message is just a denomination
[1:27:13] that's what it is
[1:27:14] it's what it is because we'll put a
[1:27:16] period behind it and we won't move on
[1:27:18] you'll see that in tapes only in these
[1:27:20] different things is what they said is
[1:27:21] that was it it's done and they haven't
[1:27:23] moved on and they haven't moved on in
[1:27:24] the Holy Ghost because God has anointed
[1:27:26] a five-fold Ministry to take us into
[1:27:28] that Rapture and the Very Prophet they
[1:27:30] claim to believe said that there would
[1:27:32] be ministers that would take us into the
[1:27:34] rapture
[1:27:35] not us as men but what the Holy Spirit
[1:27:37] leading the church and anointing men to
[1:27:40] raise the faith of the people so that
[1:27:41] they walk into a new body
[1:27:44] but I want to bring this up this idea of
[1:27:46] the promise of his presence into our
[1:27:48] lives and into this time today as we
[1:27:49] start to close
[1:27:51] in a very familiar scripture Revelation
[1:27:53] 10 says and I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:27:55] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:27:58] cloud
[1:27:59] he was clothed with a cloud in their
[1:28:00] days closed with the cloud in our day
[1:28:02] but it says in a rainbow was upon his
[1:28:04] head and his face was as it were the Sun
[1:28:07] and his feet as pillars of fire so we
[1:28:09] have a mighty angel coming down again
[1:28:11] and this is Christ if you compare his
[1:28:14] description here versus Revelation 1
[1:28:15] it's clearly Christ So This Is the
[1:28:18] personal presence this is the person of
[1:28:20] God coming down and it's not just an
[1:28:22] angel this is the mighty Angel this is
[1:28:24] Christ himself and he's clothed with a
[1:28:26] cloud which we saw in 1963
[1:28:29] and then it says he has a rainbow over
[1:28:31] his head now we know that a rainbow is
[1:28:33] always representative of what a covenant
[1:28:36] since the day of Moses went after the
[1:28:39] the flood came and went and God says
[1:28:40] I'll never I'll never destroy the Earth
[1:28:42] by water again he did what he put his
[1:28:44] bow in the sky put a rainbow in the sky
[1:28:46] and that was representative of his
[1:28:48] Covenant so whenever God makes a promise
[1:28:51] it's represented by a rainbow and then
[1:28:53] we see here in Revelation 10 so that he
[1:28:56] is a covenant Angel because he's coming
[1:28:58] down with a rainbow over him what it
[1:29:00] means is he's coming to fulfill a
[1:29:02] covenant he's coming to fulfill a
[1:29:04] promise that he made and we know what
[1:29:05] that promise is
[1:29:07] it's I will be with you I'll be in you
[1:29:10] even to the end of the age I will be a
[1:29:12] god unto you and you will be my people
[1:29:13] it's the Covenant of Abraham that is
[1:29:15] given to his seed amen and so what we
[1:29:17] see here is Christ coming down to
[1:29:19] finalize the final chapter of that
[1:29:21] Covenant
[1:29:22] that's what he's doing as he steps down
[1:29:25] it says in verse 2 and he had in his
[1:29:26] hand a little book open
[1:29:28] not a big book
[1:29:30] brother Brown says there's not many
[1:29:31] gonna make it
[1:29:34] it's not many going to make it he says
[1:29:35] in his hand a little book open and he
[1:29:37] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[1:29:39] left foot on the earth now we know in
[1:29:41] Revelation 5 that the book was sealed
[1:29:43] and then the lamb came and he took the
[1:29:45] book and between Revelation 5 and
[1:29:47] Revelation 10 the seals were opened and
[1:29:50] the details were shared with us
[1:29:52] but the details are are all in mystery
[1:29:55] form they're not written in plain
[1:29:56] English just to read them you wouldn't
[1:29:58] have a clue what it was talking about
[1:30:00] but yet in Revelation 10 we see a mighty
[1:30:03] Angel Christ coming down and now the
[1:30:05] book is open and that means that's the
[1:30:07] time for the revealing of what was going
[1:30:09] on and what's going to happen that's the
[1:30:11] end time and he says he's coming down to
[1:30:13] reveal those mysteries for a purpose and
[1:30:16] it's to do what fulfill the final
[1:30:18] portion of his Covenant it's a
[1:30:20] Redemptive book
[1:30:21] so it's all tied to Redemption it's not
[1:30:24] tied to Doctrine it's not tied to
[1:30:26] mysteries for the sake of mysteries but
[1:30:28] it's a Redemption mystery hidden in all
[1:30:30] of these things
[1:30:31] so what is this book
[1:30:33] we know it's the book of redemption it's
[1:30:35] the Lamb's Book of Life it's the title
[1:30:36] deed of redemption brother Brown would
[1:30:38] say and it's a record of all of those
[1:30:40] that are what elected predestinated and
[1:30:43] sealed by God and whoever owns it holds
[1:30:46] it is the one that owns it so Christ
[1:30:47] comes down it's his redeemed it's his
[1:30:50] purchase bride that he's coming down for
[1:30:52] now brother Brown would say this he says
[1:30:54] oh you see in this book was what was
[1:30:56] redeemed it was a book of redemption and
[1:30:59] everything that he had redeemed was
[1:31:00] written in that book all that he died
[1:31:03] for was written in the book and he could
[1:31:04] not leave his mediatorial seat until he
[1:31:07] had thoroughly redeemed and he couldn't
[1:31:09] redeem it at the cross because they were
[1:31:11] predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:31:13] and he had to stay on there to make
[1:31:15] intercessions until that last person was
[1:31:17] finished he says Glory
[1:31:19] what is it he can't finish the work
[1:31:22] until the last one's in we can't get out
[1:31:24] of here until the last one's in and he
[1:31:27] says that's why he couldn't come and
[1:31:28] take it right after of Calvary because
[1:31:30] there was two thousand years of people
[1:31:32] yet to come and he had to stay and stand
[1:31:34] in the Gap and cover our sins and hold
[1:31:37] back judgment until that last one's in
[1:31:39] and then he can step out and he can say
[1:31:41] now I'm coming for what's mine
[1:31:44] notice what he's doing is he sets a
[1:31:46] right foot on the on the the land and
[1:31:48] the left foot on the sea remember
[1:31:49] brother Brown said footsteps is
[1:31:51] possession and what's he doing is he
[1:31:53] standing on what belongs to him he's
[1:31:55] coming to claim what he has redeemed
[1:31:57] he's coming to claim what he he he he
[1:31:59] paid for Calvary
[1:32:01] brother Brown would say the lamb have
[1:32:03] redeemed it but he could not come forth
[1:32:05] until every name was revealed and that
[1:32:08] was taking place under the Sixth Seal
[1:32:10] before the seventh broke then the lamb
[1:32:12] came for what he had redeemed
[1:32:15] he come to claim what he had redeemed
[1:32:17] he's already got it right here in the
[1:32:19] book taken it from his hand but now he's
[1:32:21] coming to receive what he has redeemed
[1:32:25] that's his work he's done he's coming to
[1:32:28] receive it he says oh what a time he has
[1:32:30] proven it the seventh seal proved it
[1:32:32] he's come back and took the book of
[1:32:35] redemption so what's he doing he's
[1:32:36] calling names he's naming names he's
[1:32:39] proclaiming to his bride that I'm coming
[1:32:41] for you and it's time to go into the
[1:32:42] marriage supper of the land that's what
[1:32:44] the opening of the seals was it's the
[1:32:46] calling out of the Bride it's the
[1:32:48] calling out of the redeemed to go and be
[1:32:50] with him amen that's why we focus so
[1:32:52] much on a resurrection and a Rapture
[1:32:54] that's the final stage of this Covenant
[1:32:57] the Holy Ghost is given the last stage
[1:33:00] is for us to walk out without seeing
[1:33:01] death that's why we focus on it that's
[1:33:04] what separates us from most churches
[1:33:05] today is that we are focused on a
[1:33:07] resurrection and a Rapture and that's
[1:33:09] all we see left that's the last thing
[1:33:12] that's the last thing we see is us going
[1:33:13] out of here
[1:33:16] it says and he cried with a loud voice
[1:33:18] is when a lion roared what is it that's
[1:33:20] the king's voice that's a ruler's voice
[1:33:22] that's the voice of authority and when
[1:33:25] he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[1:33:26] their voices and when the seven Thunders
[1:33:28] had uttered their voices I was about to
[1:33:30] write this is John now it says and I
[1:33:33] Heard a Voice from having seen unto me
[1:33:34] seal up those things which the seven
[1:33:36] Thunders uttered and write them not so
[1:33:39] John had a clear understanding of what
[1:33:41] was written under those Seven Seals he
[1:33:43] understood the full events under the
[1:33:45] Seven Seals
[1:33:46] as much as a man can the only thing he
[1:33:48] wouldn't know is the day and the hour of
[1:33:51] what the Rapture because no man knows
[1:33:53] that but all the details all the
[1:33:55] Mysteries hidden there all the events
[1:33:57] that were there the voice says to him
[1:33:59] John seal it up it's not meant to be
[1:34:01] understood beforehand it's meant to be
[1:34:04] understood later after most of it is
[1:34:06] done because I'm going to set up
[1:34:07] something I'm going to set up the final
[1:34:09] stage of redemption
[1:34:11] verse 5 says in the angel which I saw
[1:34:13] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:34:15] lifted up his hand to heaven and swore
[1:34:18] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[1:34:21] created heaven and the things that there
[1:34:23] in our and the earth and the things that
[1:34:25] there in Earth and the Sea and the
[1:34:26] things that which are therein that there
[1:34:29] should be time no longer now remember
[1:34:31] that's Christ because by him were all
[1:34:33] things created and all things were
[1:34:34] created for him so Christ stands and he
[1:34:36] raises his hand and he says it's time to
[1:34:39] finish this
[1:34:40] it's a finished work I'm going to come
[1:34:43] down and I'm going to finish this it's
[1:34:44] time to wrap up the church ages it's
[1:34:46] time to wrap up Redemption for the
[1:34:48] Gentiles it's time to open the book and
[1:34:50] bring out those that have been written
[1:34:52] in there
[1:34:53] amen
[1:34:54] what is it remember he swore by who he
[1:34:58] swore by himself
[1:35:01] this is reflective of the what
[1:35:03] unconditional Covenant to the bride he's
[1:35:06] reminding us this is me going to do the
[1:35:08] work
[1:35:09] you're the recipient I'm the one that's
[1:35:11] going to do it I'm coming down and I'm
[1:35:13] going to fulfill my Grace Covenant in
[1:35:15] its totality now verse 7 says but in the
[1:35:18] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:35:19] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:35:22] of God should be finished as he had
[1:35:24] declared to his servants the prophet so
[1:35:26] this prophets this is our time amen this
[1:35:29] is the seventh angel Messenger to the
[1:35:30] seventh Church age the laodicean church
[1:35:32] age and so we know we're there we're
[1:35:34] here right now this is our time in fact
[1:35:37] we're past this time
[1:35:39] we're past this time amen we've already
[1:35:42] heard that angel and his purpose was to
[1:35:43] declare those Mysteries and be the last
[1:35:45] prophetic voice to the Gentiles
[1:35:48] but what does that what does that
[1:35:50] Ministry reveal why do the seals matter
[1:35:52] to us
[1:35:54] because they reveal the working of God
[1:35:57] through his Redemptive process they show
[1:35:59] us insight into what God's been doing
[1:36:01] all along and it's revealing what the
[1:36:03] final mystery
[1:36:04] God above us
[1:36:06] God With Us and now it's what God in us
[1:36:10] that's the final mystery is Christ in
[1:36:12] you the hope of glory displayed for the
[1:36:15] world to see
[1:36:16] that's what he's revealing you'll see
[1:36:18] brother Branham even I was just
[1:36:19] listening to a portion of adoption this
[1:36:21] morning he was and he finishes the first
[1:36:23] the first uh sermon and he says
[1:36:27] now he said he said Just Lay Your Hands
[1:36:30] on the people he says you don't even
[1:36:31] have to pray he says and the way it
[1:36:34] should work is that you come up here and
[1:36:36] I say sister so and so are you a
[1:36:38] Believer yes I'm a Believer then
[1:36:40] according to that you are heir to all
[1:36:42] the promises receive your healing and go
[1:36:43] praising Jesus name that's what he said
[1:36:46] it was about was what letting you know
[1:36:48] the mystery is in you that you are the
[1:36:51] mystery revealed it's Christ in you
[1:36:53] coming out and it's restoring to your
[1:36:55] position your possession the blessings
[1:36:57] the very presence of God in your midst
[1:37:01] you say brother John what's happening
[1:37:03] with that seven angels Ministry he's
[1:37:05] speaking from an open book
[1:37:07] he's speaking from an open book but he's
[1:37:09] not calling your name he's telling you
[1:37:11] how God is calling you out he's
[1:37:13] revealing what God has been doing all
[1:37:15] these times he's showing the full
[1:37:17] mystery of redemption
[1:37:19] brother Bradham didn't call my name
[1:37:22] the mighty Angel called my name
[1:37:25] but it was an angel voice it was a
[1:37:27] seventh angel voice that said wake up
[1:37:30] the bridegroom's coming he's almost here
[1:37:32] make yourself ready and he told us how
[1:37:35] to get ready and he told us how to get
[1:37:37] the dirt out of our lives and he showed
[1:37:38] us what was holding us back and he was
[1:37:40] preparing us for what the mighty Angel
[1:37:42] to read our name out of that book and
[1:37:44] say you're coming with me now
[1:37:47] brother Brown would say this he says
[1:37:49] nothing will be saved only those whose
[1:37:51] names were put on the Lamb's Book of
[1:37:52] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:37:54] Jew or Gentiles see that's all the book
[1:37:57] holds that mystery the book is only
[1:37:59] unfolding it now
[1:38:01] listen what he says not each one's name
[1:38:04] but what the mystery of the book is
[1:38:06] while it's calling those names so
[1:38:10] there's a name being called and it's
[1:38:12] yours and it's mine but he says the
[1:38:14] revealing of those Mysteries was to show
[1:38:15] us how God is doing it to show us what
[1:38:18] God did before through six Church ages
[1:38:21] so that we'd recognize that he's going
[1:38:23] to keep on the pattern he's going to do
[1:38:25] what he did in those six and the Seven
[1:38:27] that when times looked bad and through
[1:38:29] Dark Ages yet he preserved a people so
[1:38:32] that as we come into Leia to see the
[1:38:33] worst of all of them we can have
[1:38:35] confidence that God is working to
[1:38:37] preserve a bride and keep her out of it
[1:38:39] and keep her safe and draw her out into
[1:38:41] a resurrection and a rapture
[1:38:43] brother Branham showed us the mystery of
[1:38:45] God working through all of those times
[1:38:47] when it looked like God had done nothing
[1:38:49] to so many
[1:38:50] why so that you'd have faith now when it
[1:38:52] looks like nothing is happening at times
[1:38:56] he says you finally understand that now
[1:38:59] see the book doesn't say now levale is
[1:39:01] to be saved in the time of this church
[1:39:03] age or benevolar whoever no it doesn't
[1:39:05] say that he says it just shows the
[1:39:07] mystery it unfolds the mystery of what
[1:39:10] the thing is
[1:39:11] he says but we ourselves by faith
[1:39:14] believe it what we believe that God is
[1:39:16] doing what he said he would do he says
[1:39:19] that's what I said the other night so
[1:39:21] the mystery is revealing to us the
[1:39:22] working of God in our lives and that is
[1:39:24] what something we respond to by faith
[1:39:26] because we believe that's him calling
[1:39:28] our name
[1:39:30] that's what we have in this message amen
[1:39:33] as a as a seven Church AIDS Messengers
[1:39:35] speaking his message what's happening is
[1:39:37] a bride is being called out and the
[1:39:39] scripture says the bride hath made
[1:39:41] herself ready prophetically we're going
[1:39:43] to be ready Church
[1:39:45] he said we're going to be ready he said
[1:39:46] we're going to be spotless he said we're
[1:39:48] going to be without wrinkle and that's
[1:39:49] what this seven Church age messenger is
[1:39:51] doing is he's making us ready brother
[1:39:54] Bram says if I can only get her to stand
[1:39:56] still what I'll dress her the way he
[1:39:59] wants her to dress
[1:40:00] I'll prepare her for her wedding
[1:40:05] what was he doing brother Branham came
[1:40:06] and he would sound so hard so many times
[1:40:08] because he would just go and he'd cut
[1:40:10] and he'd cut and he cut and he says you
[1:40:13] cannot walk this road with God and be in
[1:40:16] a denomination you cannot walk this road
[1:40:18] with God and be in your high heels you
[1:40:19] cannot walk this road with God and be
[1:40:21] cutting your hair you cannot walk this
[1:40:22] road with God and be taking what you
[1:40:25] believe to be right instead of what he
[1:40:27] believes right you cannot walk this road
[1:40:28] with God and ignore the word
[1:40:30] you cannot walk this road with God and
[1:40:32] not have a prayer life you cannot walk
[1:40:34] this road with God and not have the Holy
[1:40:36] Ghost and he did it time and time again
[1:40:38] he says you cannot do it the way you've
[1:40:40] been doing it you've got to come out to
[1:40:42] him
[1:40:43] and you've got to be made known to him
[1:40:44] and he's got to be made known to you
[1:40:49] brother brother Brian would say but
[1:40:49] there are some that's got their names
[1:40:51] written on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:40:53] when them seals are thrown open there
[1:40:55] they see their name there and the Holy
[1:40:59] Spirit speaks to them they come
[1:41:02] it's not a name he's saying but what's
[1:41:04] he doing is he's speaking the word and
[1:41:06] the deep inside of you calls to the Deep
[1:41:08] that's being expressed and you say like
[1:41:10] that little Eagle in the chicken yard
[1:41:12] that's me and you hear a name and it was
[1:41:15] what an eagle calling out to you and you
[1:41:17] know that because it speaks the same
[1:41:19] language you have the same lineage you
[1:41:20] have the same bone and Bone flesh of
[1:41:22] Flesh and you say that's me he's calling
[1:41:25] me
[1:41:27] that Mama Eagle wasn't calling a name
[1:41:29] she was calling though and he heard his
[1:41:32] name in The Call
[1:41:33] he recognized that because he understood
[1:41:36] the voice he understood what it was
[1:41:37] saying he says that's got to be for me
[1:41:39] and he did what he took off and he
[1:41:41] flapped his wings and sure enough off he
[1:41:43] took and he went up to be with her
[1:41:45] he says they come you can't keep them
[1:41:47] away no one can no one they're coming
[1:41:50] anyhow because you're leading them like
[1:41:52] you did those little birds and the sheep
[1:41:54] and the cattle Thou Art God remember he
[1:41:57] talked about in India I think it was
[1:41:58] they they they had a an earthquake but
[1:42:01] hours before the earthquake all the
[1:42:03] animals went into the center of the
[1:42:04] field where there was nothing to fall on
[1:42:06] them or hurt them or anything and they
[1:42:07] huddled there way before why because God
[1:42:10] had given them an instinct God had given
[1:42:12] them something that would warn them of
[1:42:13] impending judgment and so they went to
[1:42:15] where it was safe
[1:42:17] he says some Instinct that them animals
[1:42:19] have that they know that they must get
[1:42:21] away and if instinct to an animal could
[1:42:23] warn him to flee from danger what should
[1:42:25] the Holy Spirit do to a church that
[1:42:27] claims to be filled with it
[1:42:30] if we aren't separating church then
[1:42:32] something's wrong isn't it
[1:42:34] because this world is fraught with
[1:42:36] danger to the believer
[1:42:38] there's nothing good here there's
[1:42:40] nothing worth blending there's nothing
[1:42:41] worth taking there's nothing worth
[1:42:43] asking for in this world Amen our world
[1:42:45] is not here our home is not of here it's
[1:42:47] of another kingdom it's of another place
[1:42:51] listen
[1:42:53] this Mighty Angel is Christ himself and
[1:42:55] he has come down
[1:42:57] and he descended in 1963 we know that he
[1:43:00] descended and what was it it was the
[1:43:02] opening of the word it was the opening
[1:43:03] of that book and it was the final stage
[1:43:05] it was the final step of our Redemption
[1:43:07] process and what did Brother Branham say
[1:43:11] he said this is my Ministry to declare
[1:43:14] him that he's here
[1:43:19] what did John say once Christ was there
[1:43:21] he says I must
[1:43:23] decrease
[1:43:25] and he must increase
[1:43:26] brother Bradham hasn't even preached the
[1:43:28] seals yet but he says my Ministry is to
[1:43:29] declare that he's here what is it
[1:43:31] Hebrews 13 8 was the was the the
[1:43:34] scripture for brother Adam's Ministry
[1:43:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:43:38] today and forever and he says he's the
[1:43:41] same as he was when he walked this world
[1:43:43] in flesh
[1:43:45] no difference he says except the
[1:43:46] Corporal body he's here his presence is
[1:43:48] amongst his people to do what he said he
[1:43:50] was going to do
[1:43:52] why why was he declaring him that he's
[1:43:54] here because if he doesn't walk with us
[1:43:56] Church we're not going anywhere
[1:43:58] but if you know he's here now you can
[1:44:00] start to walk
[1:44:01] and you can start to move into the
[1:44:03] promises of God you can start to move
[1:44:04] into relationship with God you can start
[1:44:06] to move into the possessions that are
[1:44:07] promised to the children of God more
[1:44:09] than you ever have before because that's
[1:44:11] what he promised to come and do in this
[1:44:12] last Church age was to bring us into the
[1:44:14] final portion of his Covenant where
[1:44:16] nothing will be held back from us
[1:44:17] nothing will be held back from us Jesus
[1:44:20] said in that day if you ask the father
[1:44:21] anything in my name I'll do it
[1:44:25] but then he would say if two or three of
[1:44:27] you agree
[1:44:28] then I'll do it and then he'd say if you
[1:44:31] ask according to his will then I'll do
[1:44:33] it what was he doing was he was pointing
[1:44:34] to the fact that those things come with
[1:44:35] a relationship with the bridegroom
[1:44:39] that's what he was driving us back to
[1:44:40] amen we can't hope to restore ourselves
[1:44:42] back
[1:44:43] listen the world's been trying to do it
[1:44:44] we've got self-help books we've got you
[1:44:47] know uh
[1:44:48] just about anything you can think of
[1:44:50] today they've got a book for it they've
[1:44:52] got a program for it they've got a plan
[1:44:53] for it and guess what it doesn't change
[1:44:55] anybody
[1:44:57] it'll help you
[1:44:58] it'll help you cope but we're not here
[1:45:00] to cope
[1:45:02] we're not here to cope Church we're here
[1:45:04] to overcome
[1:45:05] we're here to overcome we're here to get
[1:45:07] the Victory and that's going to take the
[1:45:09] working of Jesus Christ in each and
[1:45:10] every one of our Lives personally amen
[1:45:12] listen what did he say
[1:45:14] it reminds me of prophet of God was
[1:45:16] talking about the the the the Hebrew
[1:45:18] children in the fire
[1:45:20] and the angels are reporting back to God
[1:45:22] what's going on there they're walking up
[1:45:24] and the they they've turned the fire up
[1:45:26] seven times hotter lord they're about to
[1:45:28] be burned to a crisp and it's going to
[1:45:30] be bad it's going to be bad it's going
[1:45:31] to be bad
[1:45:33] and he says now they're walking up
[1:45:35] they're getting closer all the soldiers
[1:45:36] just died they're still walking forward
[1:45:38] Lord what are we going to do what are we
[1:45:40] going to do and he says God said I will
[1:45:41] go down
[1:45:43] and that's the exact same thing he said
[1:45:44] in the seventh Church age he said what I
[1:45:46] will go down this is my Covenant this is
[1:45:49] my promise I personally will come down
[1:45:51] in the midst of the people and perform
[1:45:53] that which I said I was going to do and
[1:45:56] I won't stop until every single one
[1:45:58] whose names are written in that open
[1:45:59] book
[1:46:00] are where they need to be what is it
[1:46:03] sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:04] sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:07] I'm going to invite the musicians to
[1:46:09] come I want to read one more scripture
[1:46:11] as we close
[1:46:15] this is Psalms 139 I'm going to read
[1:46:17] most of it
[1:46:19] says O Lord thou has searched me and
[1:46:22] known me
[1:46:24] thou knowest my down sitting and mine
[1:46:26] Uprising thou understand it's my
[1:46:28] thoughts are far off
[1:46:30] thou compasses my path and my line down
[1:46:33] and are acquainted with all my ways that
[1:46:35] means I you surround my life my walk
[1:46:38] whenever I'm up whether I'm down whether
[1:46:40] I'm sleeping whether I'm walking around
[1:46:41] you're acquainted with everything I Do
[1:46:43] Lord
[1:46:44] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[1:46:47] Lo O Lord thou knowest it altogether
[1:46:50] thou Hast beset me behind and before and
[1:46:54] laid thine hand upon me what's he saying
[1:46:57] there Lord You've surrounded my life
[1:46:59] says and laid thy hand upon me laying
[1:47:01] out of hands is Anointed is pointing to
[1:47:04] two things it's always associated with
[1:47:06] healing
[1:47:07] and it's associated with anointing
[1:47:10] he says such knowledge is too wonderful
[1:47:12] for me it's high and I cannot attain to
[1:47:15] it whether shall I go from thy Spirit
[1:47:18] we're talking about the promise of his
[1:47:20] presence Lord where would I go from your
[1:47:22] spirit or where shall I flee from thy
[1:47:25] presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou
[1:47:28] Art there if I make my bed in hell
[1:47:30] behold Thou Art there if I take the
[1:47:33] wings of the morning and dwell in the
[1:47:35] uttermost parts of the sea even there
[1:47:38] thy hand shall thy hand lead me and thy
[1:47:41] right hand shall hold me the right hand
[1:47:43] of power and authority Church we're not
[1:47:45] holding on to him he's holding on to us
[1:47:49] that's the working in this Covenant amen
[1:47:51] if I say surely the darkness will cover
[1:47:54] me
[1:47:55] even the night shall be light about me
[1:47:58] if you say Lord there's no way out
[1:48:00] there's no way this is too bad it's too
[1:48:03] dark it's too hard
[1:48:05] it says even the night will be light
[1:48:07] about me
[1:48:08] yea the darkness hideth not from thee
[1:48:11] but the night shineth as the day the
[1:48:14] darkness and the light are both alike to
[1:48:16] thee for thou has possessed my Reigns
[1:48:19] Lord You've LED and guided me to where I
[1:48:21] am today
[1:48:23] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[1:48:25] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[1:48:28] and wonderfully made marvelous I thy
[1:48:31] works and that my soul knoweth right
[1:48:33] well
[1:48:34] my substance was not hid from thee when
[1:48:36] I was made in secret and curiously
[1:48:38] wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth
[1:48:40] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet be
[1:48:44] made unperfect
[1:48:46] and in thy book all my members were
[1:48:49] written
[1:48:49] every part of us was known and
[1:48:51] predestinated by God beforehand It Was
[1:48:54] Written beforehand he says which in
[1:48:56] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:48:58] there was none of them
[1:49:00] how precious also are thy thoughts on to
[1:49:03] me oh God
[1:49:04] what did Jeremiah Say
[1:49:06] he repeats God and God says my thoughts
[1:49:09] are of peace and not of evil
[1:49:11] to give you an expected end
[1:49:15] how precious are thy thoughts unto me o
[1:49:18] God how great is the sum of them if I
[1:49:21] should count them they are more than
[1:49:22] number in the sand
[1:49:24] when I awake I am still with thee
[1:49:27] what it means there is if I fall asleep
[1:49:29] counting your blessings Lord when I wake
[1:49:31] up I'm still counting because I cannot
[1:49:34] count them all
[1:49:36] amen God bless you let's stand this
[1:49:37] morning
[1:49:39] amend the promise of his presence
[1:49:44] I want to encourage you this morning
[1:49:49] he never said it would be easy
[1:49:52] never said it would be simple
[1:49:54] but he said he'd always be with us
[1:49:57] and that's what we hold on to
[1:50:00] when we can't see
[1:50:01] what seems like darkness is around us
[1:50:03] seems like things are pressing in our
[1:50:05] Only Hope and Faith has to be that Lord
[1:50:07] you're here and I'm walking in the light
[1:50:09] as you're in the light and that's what's
[1:50:11] going to take me all the way through
[1:50:12] that's where our faith is is in his
[1:50:15] presence in the promise of his word and
[1:50:18] that he said where two or three are
[1:50:19] gathered in my name there I am in the
[1:50:21] midst of them we've gathered together to
[1:50:24] enjoy his presence this morning amen
[1:50:26] but he's there even when we walk out the
[1:50:28] door
[1:50:29] he's there when we're sitting on our bed
[1:50:30] when we're driving in our car when we're
[1:50:32] having our devotions when we're unsure
[1:50:34] of which way to go he's there and he
[1:50:36] will provide a way and he'll give the
[1:50:38] answer that we're looking for amen

[2:09:26] you guys can be seated there for a few
[2:09:28] minutes there
[2:09:34] just wanted to let you guys know
[2:09:37] normally at the beginning of the year we
[2:09:40] have an election for the different
[2:09:41] offices
[2:09:42] obviously this year has been a bit tied
[2:09:44] up with the church
[2:09:47] and trying to get settled in here
[2:09:50] so now we're coming to a point where we
[2:09:51] feel we owned a building let's move into
[2:09:53] elections
[2:09:55] so that's what this announcement is
[2:09:57] about here at the moment
[2:09:59] uh there's been a bit of change uh
[2:10:02] brother Mark
[2:10:04] He has expressed that he's going to step
[2:10:06] down from a couple of his positions uh
[2:10:09] the first one being Sunday school
[2:10:10] superintendent
[2:10:12] so he's stepping down from that
[2:10:14] officially
[2:10:15] and it's been recommended that brother
[2:10:17] Paul Coffey take that position
[2:10:20] so when we have the vote his name will
[2:10:23] be going forward onto the ballot for
[2:10:24] that position
[2:10:26] also better Mark stepped down from
[2:10:29] trustee
[2:10:31] uh
[2:10:32] and he's it's been recommended that
[2:10:35] brother Dale take that position
[2:10:38] so his name will be going forward on the
[2:10:40] ballots we've checked with these
[2:10:42] brothers and they both agreed for their
[2:10:44] name to go forward
[2:10:46] I'd also like to pause here at the
[2:10:48] moment and Express Thanks for brother
[2:10:51] Mark in those roles over the years he's
[2:10:53] been very very faithful and diligent and
[2:10:56] we should thank you very much for that
[2:10:58] us
[2:11:06] especially over the last six months
[2:11:08] without dealing with all the legals uh
[2:11:11] matters concerning this building and
[2:11:12] real estate I'd very much appreciated my
[2:11:15] God bless you richly for your efforts
[2:11:19] but a Market's not out of the picture
[2:11:20] he's going to retain his role as the
[2:11:22] treasurer and again we thank him very
[2:11:25] much for being diligent in that area as
[2:11:27] well and that he continues Lord willin
[2:11:29] in the days and years to come
[2:11:32] when it comes back to the matter of the
[2:11:34] election Lord will we will have that
[2:11:36] next Sunday
[2:11:38] uh

[2:12:09] for anyone here
[2:12:12] um
[2:12:13] also
