[34:27] exactly
[34:29] why. Amen.
[34:33] I can't

[36:13] It was a tight
[36:16] simple
[36:22] sten
[36:26] and
[36:28] hardly a
[36:31] place for a
[36:34] king to be born. Let's stand.
[36:39] He didn't
[36:40] choose something
[36:44] special to reveal his
[36:51] majesty. So I know if I give him
[36:58] control, he'll
[37:01] revive me.
[37:04] Let your
[37:07] word be
[37:10] born in the manger of my
[37:15] heart. Amen. Let it live in
[37:22] me. Let it
[37:29] star live inside this house. Ask
[37:35] for and mold it every
[37:40] day.

[37:47] born in the
[37:51] pain of
[37:54] my heart.
[37:58] [Music]
[38:03] Outwardly I'm
[38:07] nothing much
[38:14] to be a
[38:18] place for his word to unfold.
[38:25] Oh, but if I just yield this
[38:31] vessel and let him have his
[38:37] way from glory unto
[38:43] glory. He'll change me day by day.
[38:50] Let your
[38:53] word be
[38:56] born in the manger of my
[39:03] heart. Oh, let it live in
[39:08] me. Let it
[39:15] start. Live inside this house.
[39:28] Oh, let your word be
[39:33] born in the
[39:37] manger
[39:39] of
[39:40] my
[39:43] heart. Amen, Lord.
[39:47] Lord, this is a walk of
[39:48] yielding, Lord. A walk where we let go.
[39:52] A walk where we trust and
[39:55] rest. Lord, we let you be the head to
[39:59] control our hands and our feet and our
[40:01] mouth. Lord, we even let our mind go,
[40:04] Lord, and we take on the mind of
[40:07] Christ. Lord, it's a walk of
[40:10] faith, Lord. It's a process of time,
[40:12] this letting go and letting God have his
[40:14] way.
[40:16] But Lord, that's why we come into your
[40:17] presence. That's why we hear your word.
[40:19] That's why we humble ourselves before
[40:21] you, Lord. That you could do a work
[40:23] inside of us that we can't do ourselves,
[40:25] heavenly father. Lord, we're thankful
[40:27] we're drawn. We're thankful we're
[40:29] called. We're thankful we've got an
[40:30] invitation that we've responded to,
[40:33] Lord. That we could come into your
[40:34] presence and we could be changed like
[40:35] into your glorious image, heavenly
[40:37] father. Lord, I pray you just take this
[40:40] message tonight, Lord. May this people
[40:42] and it just become one. We pray, Lord.
[40:44] May you encourage us, Lord. strengthen
[40:46] us, Lord. Point us in the right
[40:48] direction, Lord. Get our mind on you.
[40:49] Get our thoughts on you, Lord. Raise our
[40:51] faith, Lord, to respond to your word. We
[40:53] pray, Lord. Bless these faithful people,
[40:56] we ask. In Jesus Christ's name we pray
[40:58] it. Amen. May God bless you. Turn, if
[41:01] you would, to John chapter 3. John
[41:04] chapter 3. Welcome each one here. We
[41:06] certainly have a smaller crowd than we
[41:07] finished with on Sunday, but I sure
[41:10] enjoyed our week with Brother Barry
[41:11] Coffee and the two times he ministered
[41:13] and the the marriage seminar we did with
[41:16] him. Just had a wonderful time with him
[41:18] and with the saints and visitors and all
[41:21] these different things. Amen. Trusting
[41:23] you did as well. Got lots of good
[41:25] reports from pretty much everyone, I
[41:26] think, or every family. So, we praise
[41:29] the Lord for that. It's always good to
[41:30] be in fellowship. Definitely want to
[41:31] remember brother Barry and Sister
[41:32] Darlene Guy. uh she's in the hospital
[41:35] not doing very well of course and and uh
[41:38] sister Leah's gone to be with her and
[41:40] then coming back again but want to
[41:42] remember her and brother Barry as well
[41:43] and then brother Joe and brother Vichel
[41:45] are also in Halifax this week for work
[41:47] so we want to remember them as well.
[41:50] Amen. God bless you. John chapter 3
[41:52] says, "Jes," this is Jesus conversation
[41:54] with Nicodemus, you remember? And it
[41:56] says, "Jesus answered and said, verily,
[41:58] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[42:01] born of water and of the spirit, he
[42:03] cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[42:05] That which is born of the flesh is
[42:08] flesh, and that which is born of the
[42:10] spirit is spirit." Amen. God bless you.
[42:13] You can have your seats this evening. I
[42:14] want to kind of pick up where we left
[42:16] off last time. If you remember, we were
[42:18] preaching on Peter and we talked about
[42:19] what a true conversion looks like. And
[42:21] we went through Peter's life when we saw
[42:23] the changing of him from from being a
[42:25] good man and a and a good student and
[42:27] and a you know a believer and turning
[42:30] him from a believer into a true son of
[42:32] God. Amen. To to get him to a point
[42:34] where he could live. And we saw that
[42:36] that huge change that was there. But I
[42:38] want to take us now into the depths of
[42:40] what it looks like for you and I and and
[42:42] the and even the struggles we face and
[42:44] and the doubts that can come in and the
[42:46] hardships that we face on a day-by-day
[42:47] basis. And I want to take this certainly
[42:49] for the next two services, Lord willing,
[42:51] a a thought of the divided kingdom, the
[42:53] divided kingdom. And I want to talk to
[42:55] us about the honest realities of being a
[42:58] son or a daughter of God in Leodysia and
[43:00] what it looks like living a life where
[43:02] you're filled with the Holy Spirit. And
[43:04] I really appreciated where brother Barry
[43:06] kind of went in that last service. He
[43:07] kind of set me up for this and I never
[43:09] ask a preacher what he's going to preach
[43:11] unless they bring it up. I don't know.
[43:12] But he he certainly said some things
[43:14] that kind of lined up with this and and
[43:16] I appreciate that the Lord works in that
[43:18] way many times. He'll he'll just bring
[43:20] somebody in and they'll reinforce
[43:21] certain things and take you a little bit
[43:22] further and then you can almost pick up
[43:24] where you left off. But if you remember
[43:26] in that service he was talking about the
[43:28] the the nature of your flesh versus the
[43:30] nature of your soul. And and that's
[43:32] really where we have a divided kingdom
[43:34] in ourselves. We have the soul part
[43:36] which is eternal. It came from God.
[43:38] Remember Adam was a soul and then he was
[43:40] made a living soul. So he was in spirit
[43:43] form as God was. Remember Adam was made
[43:45] in the image of God and he was in spirit
[43:47] form and then God created a body for him
[43:49] and then he put Adam into that and Adam
[43:52] became a living soul. And the reason God
[43:54] had to do that with Adam was because
[43:55] Adam was a reflection of God. And God
[43:57] had made himself a body and stepped into
[43:59] it. And so Adam needed a body for his
[44:01] spirit to step into it as well. And so
[44:04] God put Adam through that same
[44:05] progression. And Adam was in a perfect
[44:07] body formed by God. But after the fall,
[44:10] his soul was still eternal, but the body
[44:13] now became cursed. It was not a perfect
[44:15] body anymore. It was he had the eternal
[44:18] part of God living inside that body that
[44:20] was cursed. And so right there, we had a
[44:22] divided kingdom walking around every
[44:24] day. And guess what? We inherited the
[44:26] same kingdom that Adam has. We've got a
[44:28] body that's cursed, and we've got a soul
[44:30] that comes from God. Amen. And that's a
[44:32] daily battle for every one of us. And I
[44:34] think the biggest lie that Satan tries
[44:36] to tell us is in this divided kingdom,
[44:38] in this cursed body, we have to live a
[44:40] life where our words are perfect, where
[44:42] our actions are perfect, where our
[44:43] thoughts are perfect, our reactions are
[44:45] perfect, our attitudes are perfect, our
[44:47] decisions are perfect. Everything is
[44:49] about as perfect is because we're a
[44:50] Christian. And guess what? That is not
[44:52] what the Bible tells us. Jesus never put
[44:55] that burden on us. Amen. That's why we
[44:57] needed, as brother Barry was saying, we
[44:59] needed a savior. We needed a redeemer.
[45:01] We needed somebody that could live the
[45:03] life that we can't live. And we still
[45:05] need him today even with the Holy
[45:07] Spirit. We still need representation. We
[45:10] still need the blood of Calvary because
[45:12] there is no expectation that we can live
[45:14] a perfect life. That is not where our
[45:16] perfection is. Our perfection now is in
[45:18] yielding, not in works. That's the way
[45:21] it works for us now because we're under
[45:22] grace. We're under grace and it's him
[45:24] that stands for us now. And so when a
[45:26] believer comes to him, amen, we lay down
[45:28] our self and we say, "Don't look at me.
[45:31] I'm going to accept by faith the work of
[45:33] Calvary. Look at him." That's where
[45:35] we're supposed to be looking today
[45:37] because he was the one that was perfect
[45:39] in every single way. And yet we'll sit
[45:41] here and if we're honest, sometimes we
[45:43] really beat ourselves up over our
[45:45] mistakes. Amen. Me and Sister Justine
[45:48] and Matt, we beat ourselves up over
[45:50] mistakes. Sister Brenda made a mistake
[45:52] today, apparently.
[45:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[45:57] Sometimes we need to make a mistake to
[45:59] get us back to God. I'm not saying you
[46:00] needed that, Sister Brenda, but
[46:02] sometimes we need to make a mistake
[46:04] because it lets us know I still need
[46:06] him. I can't make this without him. This
[46:09] flesh is going to get me occasionally.
[46:11] Amen. And I'm glad that we can say we
[46:13] make mistakes sometimes. Amen. We ought
[46:15] to be sorry when we make mistakes. We
[46:18] ought to be a repentant people. But let
[46:19] me tell you, when we get away from
[46:21] repentance, we've gotten away from God
[46:23] because in his presence, we recognize
[46:25] his holiness and we recognize his
[46:27] righteousness and we know we want to be
[46:29] in good standing. And so repentance
[46:31] brings us back into his pre into his
[46:33] presence. And I'll tell you, it's a
[46:34] leady to seeing condition when we won't
[46:36] repent. When we think I've got it all, I
[46:38] know it all. I am it all. And guess
[46:40] what? When you do that, you have stepped
[46:42] into Satan's kingdom where he has made
[46:44] it all about himself. Amen. We cannot do
[46:46] those things. Amen. But besides that,
[46:48] there are many people today and even
[46:51] talking to some people over this
[46:52] weekend, there are many today that that
[46:54] that go to God and they can't accept his
[46:57] full forgiveness. God forgives them. God
[47:00] has forgiven them. God is forgiving
[47:02] them. God will forgive them. But they
[47:04] can't accept it. And so they walk
[47:05] through life thinking, "I'm no good. I
[47:08] can't even be a
[47:09] Christian." Listen, we don't come become
[47:12] a Christian so we can become a
[47:14] Christian. We come to him as we are. We
[47:18] come to him exactly as we are with all
[47:20] our lumps, with all of our warts, with
[47:23] all of our issues. And we come to him
[47:24] and we say, "I'm laying myself down at
[47:27] Calvary. And I want you to take me
[47:30] through
[47:31] him. Not through my works, not cuz I've
[47:34] cleaned up my life, not because I've
[47:36] kicked the smokes out, because I've
[47:37] kicked the alcohol out, cuz I've kicked
[47:38] the pornography out." No, we come to him
[47:40] and say, "Here, I need you, but take me
[47:43] through Christ. look at him and draw me
[47:45] through that open door of Christ and
[47:47] from there take me and make me into a
[47:49] new creation. We can't come as a new
[47:51] creation cuz that'll be a work of our
[47:53] own hands and it's going to fall every
[47:55] single time. Amen. But yet when we go
[47:58] through that process and somebody and I
[48:01] know believers like this unfortunately
[48:03] they can't seem to get over it and it's
[48:05] because they lack a revelation of what
[48:07] justification means. They don't
[48:09] understand what the blood of Christ
[48:10] does. And so they can never walked away
[48:13] without that conscience being cleansed,
[48:15] without that purging that brother Grant
[48:17] spoke about a little while ago. Amen.
[48:19] But even when we get the Holy Spirit,
[48:21] even when we get the true new birth, we
[48:24] make
[48:25] mistakes. This is going to be a service
[48:27] about how we make mistakes, church. It's
[48:29] a divided kingdom. We've got a side of
[48:31] us that is flawed, that is carnal, that
[48:34] is broken, that is sinful. And the new
[48:37] birth doesn't change that side. But what
[48:39] it does is it creates a battle line.
[48:41] Amen. It shows us there's a division in
[48:44] the kingdom. Amen. And look at what Paul
[48:46] says. I want to take us into Romans 7.
[48:48] And that's where we'll spend most of our
[48:49] time tonight. Brother B or uh Paul would
[48:52] say this. He says, "Know ye not,
[48:54] brethren, for I speak to them that know
[48:56] the law." Now Paul is speaking now
[48:58] through the filter of the law. This is
[49:01] Paul speaking through the filter of
[49:03] works. This is Paul speaking through the
[49:05] filter of what I can do and more
[49:07] importantly what I can't seem to do.
[49:10] Okay? So don't look at this as the end
[49:12] condition of a believer. But this is one
[49:15] side of the coin that is the divided
[49:17] kingdom of your body in your life right
[49:18] now. Okay? He says I know how that the
[49:22] law have dominion over man as long as he
[49:24] liveth. For the woman which hath an
[49:26] husband is bound by the law to her
[49:28] husband so long as he lives. But if the
[49:30] husband dead be dead, she's loosed from
[49:32] the law of her husband. We know this
[49:33] from marriage and divorce that a woman
[49:35] cannot remarry until her husband is
[49:38] dead. Period. There is no exception to
[49:41] that in scripture. Okay? So he's saying
[49:43] the law is like that. He says, "So then
[49:46] if while her husband liveth, she be
[49:47] married to another man, she shall be
[49:49] called an adulteress. But if her husband
[49:51] be dead, she is free from that law. So
[49:54] she is no adulteress, though she be
[49:56] married to another man." So he's drawing
[49:58] what our life condition. Now, this one
[50:02] side of this divided kingdom, and he's
[50:04] comparing it to being bound to a
[50:06] husband, he says, "Wherefore, my
[50:10] brethren," he says, "s ye are also
[50:12] become dead to the law by the body of
[50:16] Christ, that you should be married to an
[50:19] other, even to him who is raised from
[50:22] the dead, that we should bring forth
[50:24] fruit unto God." He says, "For when we
[50:27] were in the flesh, the motions of sin
[50:30] which were by the law did work in our
[50:32] members to bring forth fruit unto
[50:34] death." He says, "While you were living
[50:36] according to the flesh under the law,
[50:38] all you could do was bring out
[50:40] death." He says, "But now are we we are
[50:44] delivered from the law, that being dead
[50:46] wherein we were held." He says that we
[50:49] should serve in newness of spirit and
[50:52] not in the oldness of the letter. Okay,
[50:55] I want to stop here because Paul's
[50:57] painting a picture for us. And I love
[50:59] Paul because Paul never pretends he's
[51:02] perfect. But he points us to the perfect
[51:04] walk of the believer. And it seems like
[51:07] there's a contradiction there. But Paul
[51:09] is not speaking this by theology. Paul
[51:12] is speaking this by personal experience.
[51:14] Okay. So this is the prophet of God, the
[51:16] first church age messenger, a man full
[51:19] of the Holy Ghost, more signs, more
[51:21] wonders, more gifts than any other
[51:23] believer of his time. And this is what
[51:25] he's going to tell us about. Okay? But
[51:27] remember, Paul under the law was
[51:30] zealous. He was spiritual. He was well
[51:33] taught. He loved the word of God. And
[51:35] under the law, in the flesh, he was
[51:38] antichrist in his actions. And all he
[51:40] could produce was death, figuratively
[51:42] and literally. Okay? But Paul says, now
[51:45] that the law has been fulfilled, the law
[51:47] is dead to you, you don't have to be
[51:49] married to the law because the law works
[51:51] in a certain way in your life, and if
[51:53] you're stuck on the law, it's going to
[51:55] keep producing it. But you can walk now
[51:57] by another law, which is in newness of
[51:59] spirit, and that will change the way you
[52:02] look at yourself. It'll change the way
[52:03] you walk day by day. It'll change how
[52:05] you look at yourself when you mess up
[52:07] even. Okay? Remember what Jesus said to
[52:10] Nicodemus and this was the opening
[52:12] scripture we started with about this
[52:13] divided kingdom. He said Jesus answered
[52:15] and said verily verily I say unto thee
[52:18] except a man be born of water and of the
[52:20] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[52:22] of God. That which is born of the flesh
[52:25] is flesh and that which is born of the
[52:27] spirit is spirit. So in other words, you
[52:30] can't make the flesh part like the
[52:31] spirit and you can't make the spirit
[52:33] part like the flesh. They're
[52:34] incompatible. They are divided. They are
[52:37] not the same thing.
[52:38] Okay, the flesh part will always be the
[52:41] flesh part in this world and the spirit
[52:44] part will always be the spirit part in
[52:46] this world. Okay, they're two halves and
[52:48] you have body, soul, and spirit. But
[52:50] looking at it from God's eyes, your bo
[52:52] your soul and your spirit are the same
[52:53] thing. They're bound in the same way
[52:55] because he gives you a new heart and a
[52:57] new spirit and then he gives you his
[52:59] spirit. So those are all tied into one
[53:01] kingdom because they come from him. But
[53:03] on the other side, you have this flesh.
[53:05] And when you look at Ezekiel 36 and
[53:07] Jeremiah 31, as brother Barry was
[53:09] talking about, you see nothing there
[53:10] about the body. The flesh is outside of
[53:13] that process that we get here by the new
[53:16] birth. But we'll see it's not left out.
[53:18] It's just not part of what we're getting
[53:20] through here. So we're stuck in a body
[53:23] in flesh in carnality that is unredeemed
[53:26] and untouched by the new birth process.
[53:28] And that's where the battle is today.
[53:30] It's between the part that has been
[53:31] changed and the part that has not been
[53:33] changed. Okay, we have a part that comes
[53:36] from God. That's our that's the the
[53:38] spirit of God in us. It's the new spirit
[53:40] he gave us, the new nature he gave us.
[53:42] But then we have the part that comes
[53:43] unfortunately from our parents. And no
[53:45] matter how good they are, it is still
[53:47] sinful and fallen and carnal. And it is
[53:50] at end enmity with the spirit of God.
[53:52] Amen. So if you don't believe me, let's
[53:55] just keep reading with Paul in Romans 7
[53:56] here tonight because as I said, this is
[53:59] the first church age messenger, a man
[54:00] full of the Holy Ghost, a prophet. And
[54:03] he's talking about the battle of the
[54:04] flesh. He says in the ampl and just this
[54:07] first verse is the amplified just so we
[54:09] understand. He says, "For I do not
[54:11] understand my own actions." He says,
[54:13] "I'm bewildered. I'm baffled. I do not
[54:16] practice or accomplish what I wish, but
[54:18] I do the very things that I loathe."
[54:21] Boy, Paul's not much of a Holy Ghost fil
[54:23] man,
[54:26] church. He says, "If then I do that
[54:28] which I would not, I consent unto the
[54:30] law that it is good. But now then it is
[54:33] no more I that doeth, but sin that
[54:35] dwelleth in me." See, you say, "I've
[54:38] been cleansed. I've been reborn." Yes,
[54:39] but a portion of you hasn't. And sin
[54:41] dwells mightily in that portion. There's
[54:44] an army of sin in this flesh, if you
[54:46] want to talk about
[54:48] it. He says, "For I know that in me." He
[54:51] says that is in my
[54:54] flesh. See, we got to understand what
[54:56] we're talking about here. He says, "In
[54:59] my flesh dwells no good thing. For to
[55:02] will is present with me, but how to
[55:04] perform that which is good, I find not."
[55:06] See, there's a will to do good, but
[55:08] there's a gap between our desires and
[55:10] our and our abilities. And he says, I
[55:13] can't seem to close that gap where in my
[55:16] flesh. This is not a spirit problem.
[55:19] This is a flesh problem because the
[55:22] flesh has desires and the inner man has
[55:24] desires.
[55:26] Okay? We've got deity and we've got sin
[55:29] fighting it out in our body. We've got
[55:32] natural DNA which is this flesh and
[55:34] we've got spiritual DNA which is our
[55:36] soul filled with the spirit. And those
[55:37] two are button heads all day
[55:40] long. He says how to perform that which
[55:42] is good I find not. He says, "For the
[55:44] good that I would do or for the good
[55:47] that I would, I do
[55:49] not." He says, "But the evil which I
[55:51] would not, that I do." This is a
[55:53] frustration for
[55:55] Paul. He says, "Now, if I do that, I
[55:57] would not, it is no more I that do it,
[55:59] but sin that dwelleth in me." Boy, he's
[56:00] got this excuse down really good. It's
[56:02] not me, it's the sin that's in me. But
[56:04] he's trying to get us to focus on where
[56:06] the two kingdoms are in the body.
[56:09] There's a kingdom of the born again in
[56:11] the soul and there's a kingdom of the
[56:12] damned in this flesh. There's a sin
[56:15] portion and there's an eternal godly
[56:17] portion. Amen. He's not trying to make
[56:19] an excuse. He's trying to show us the
[56:21] battle that goes on every single day for
[56:23] a believer. For one that's been filled
[56:25] with the spirit of God. He says, "I find
[56:28] then a law that when I would do good,
[56:30] evil is present with me. It's always
[56:33] there. It never goes away." He says,
[56:36] "For I delight in the law of God after
[56:38] the inward man." And we do, don't we?
[56:41] Inwardly, we always want this, but
[56:43] there's also a desire elsewhere that is
[56:45] fighting against that. And that's what
[56:47] Paul's talking about
[56:49] here. Amen. If we're born again, there's
[56:51] something inside of us that resists. But
[56:53] if we're not, look out. It'll have its
[56:55] way with you every time. He says, "But I
[56:57] see another law where? In my members."
[57:01] That means this body. This stinking
[57:03] flesh. Okay? He says, "Worrying against
[57:06] the law of my mind and bringing me into
[57:08] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[57:11] my members." Amen. It's this flesh body.
[57:13] It's this members full of sin that leads
[57:15] to actions that lead us to death and
[57:16] destruction. Amen. It's a battle of the
[57:18] soul versus the body. He says, "Oh
[57:20] wretched man that I am, who shall
[57:22] deliver me from this body of death?" Now
[57:24] notice, he doesn't need a full
[57:26] deliverance. He just needs a body
[57:28] deliverance. He doesn't say, "I need a
[57:30] deliverance from my soul, from my
[57:31] spirit." He says, "I need a body
[57:33] deliverance." Amen. He says, "But I
[57:35] thank God through Christ Jesus our
[57:38] Lord." He says, "So then with the mind I
[57:40] myself serve the law of God, but the
[57:43] flesh, but with the flesh, the law of
[57:45] sin." So you have this divided kingdom.
[57:46] You have the mind. Brother B would say
[57:48] that's the soul as well. It includes the
[57:50] spirit and these different things that's
[57:51] tied to God, but this flesh is bound up
[57:53] to sin. Now, you look through all of
[57:56] that and you'd say, "Boy, Paul's really
[57:57] struggling. Does Paul even really have
[57:59] the Holy Ghost?"
[58:02] Look in there. He says, "Every," he he
[58:04] says it in a way that sounds like every
[58:06] time I want to do good, I end up doing
[58:08] bad. I keep wanting to do the right
[58:11] thing and I keep doing the wrong
[58:13] thing. Anybody ever feel like that?
[58:17] Sometimes you just you have every right
[58:19] and good intention and then you walk
[58:22] right up to the decision and if right is
[58:24] right and left is wrong, what do we do?
[58:26] We
[58:27] go like that. more convenient, less
[58:31] hassle, less pain, less
[58:35] embarrassment. Easier.
[58:38] Amen. But he's pointing to a life also
[58:41] where you trust in your works rather
[58:44] than in the grace of
[58:46] God. Amen. Because if we're focused on
[58:48] performance, we're never going to make
[58:50] it to heaven. We will, but it won't be
[58:52] because of our performance. It'll be
[58:53] again by the grace of God. Amen. But
[58:55] he's pointing to the fact that you don't
[58:57] have to walk outside of your home to be
[59:00] in a battle. You're in a battle every
[59:02] single day. So whether we sit at home
[59:04] and say, "I'm not letting Satan in."
[59:06] Guess what, church? He's in your members
[59:07] already. There's a battle. Whether
[59:09] you're sitting on your couch, whether
[59:10] you're in front of your computer, you're
[59:11] mowing your lawn, or you're out working
[59:13] in public or talking to people, wherever
[59:15] it might be. There's a battle going on
[59:17] every single day. And sometimes we win,
[59:20] and sometimes we lose. Amen. If we're
[59:23] honest, listen, we don't want to go
[59:25] around giving a testimony of all the
[59:27] times we lose. But church, if we're
[59:28] always losing, there's a problem. We're
[59:31] supposed to be overcomers. Amen. We're
[59:34] supposed to be getting the victory, the
[59:36] spirit of God is in us to overcome. And
[59:38] if we're always losing, we've got a
[59:41] problem. And I've said it before, I'll
[59:43] say it again. If something has cropped
[59:45] up in your life, go look at what you've
[59:48] changed
[59:49] recently. Because you can't have
[59:51] something you never had before unless
[59:53] something has come into your life
[59:54] differently. And it's because we open
[59:56] doors. It's because we start a new
[59:58] relationship. We start reading a certain
[1:00:00] book. We start looking at certain
[1:00:01] things. We start spending our time
[1:00:03] differently. Maybe spending our money
[1:00:04] differently. Whatever it is, look for
[1:00:06] the change. And often times that's the
[1:00:08] door that Satan comes in through. I
[1:00:10] speak by personal experience. And it can
[1:00:12] be the littlest thing, church. It could
[1:00:14] be the littlest thing because all he
[1:00:15] needs is to just get a little a little
[1:00:18] pry bar in there and then he starts to
[1:00:19] crack it open and then a little bit more
[1:00:20] and a little bit more and a little bit
[1:00:22] more and all of a sudden we say, "Hey,
[1:00:23] where did this come from?" And we tied
[1:00:25] it back to one single little thing that
[1:00:27] we did one night. One little book we
[1:00:29] read, one little conversation that we
[1:00:31] followed up on, one person that maybe we
[1:00:33] shouldn't be hanging around with,
[1:00:34] whatever it might be. Brother Ram says
[1:00:36] this. He says, "Forgive our many
[1:00:38] weaknesses, Lord. We don't intend to do
[1:00:41] anything wrong, Lord. But through our
[1:00:43] flesh, we do make mistakes. How often?
[1:00:47] Daily. So in order to stay alive in
[1:00:50] Christ, we have to die to our own
[1:00:52] thoughts. So keep us dead to ourselves
[1:00:56] and alive in him. Let our bodies and
[1:00:59] soul be so submissive to him that people
[1:01:02] will see the reflection of Christ as we
[1:01:05] go or come or whatever we do. Now,
[1:01:09] that's one thing of of of the side of of
[1:01:11] of sins of commission, if I could put it
[1:01:14] that way, where we do something wrong.
[1:01:16] We we fall, we didn't pay attention, we
[1:01:18] got sidetracked, whatever that might be.
[1:01:20] We opened up a door. Sometimes it's not
[1:01:23] that we start started doing something.
[1:01:25] is that we stopped doing the right
[1:01:26] things. We stopped feeding on the right
[1:01:28] things. We stopped hanging around the
[1:01:30] right people. We stopped going to
[1:01:31] church. We stopped doing whatever it
[1:01:33] might be. And that's what the door
[1:01:35] opened. Amen. But sometimes we're doing
[1:01:37] exactly what we ought to be doing as
[1:01:39] well. And we get into trouble because
[1:01:41] what do we do? We get ahead of God.
[1:01:44] That's what Moses did. Moses a
[1:01:46] deliverer. But remember, Moses got ahead
[1:01:49] of God's plan. He knew who he was, but
[1:01:51] he didn't stop and wait for directions.
[1:01:54] And sometimes we know what we're
[1:01:55] supposed to do, but we don't know when.
[1:01:57] And we don't maybe know quite know how.
[1:01:59] But we presume and we jump out and we do
[1:02:01] something we ought not to. Joshua did
[1:02:03] the same thing after Jericho. He didn't
[1:02:04] check with God and say, "Hey, God, is
[1:02:06] everything good before we go to this
[1:02:07] next battle?" Cuz God had said, "Just go
[1:02:09] take the land." But he was expecting
[1:02:11] Joshua to come talk to the captain of
[1:02:13] the host before he went to the next
[1:02:15] place. And Joshua didn't. And they lost
[1:02:17] 30 odd men because they didn't clean the
[1:02:18] camp of sin. Amen. Sometimes we're doing
[1:02:21] the right thing and it's in God's will,
[1:02:23] but we get a little too personally
[1:02:25] involved and we let our personality take
[1:02:27] hold and we start to make mistakes, done
[1:02:31] it many times and had to repent many
[1:02:32] times. What do we do? We let ourselves
[1:02:34] get involved rather than just letting
[1:02:36] him lead the
[1:02:38] way. Brother Brown would say this. He
[1:02:40] says, "But a man that's going to do
[1:02:41] something is going to blunder. He's
[1:02:44] going to fall." Brother John, this is
[1:02:46] sure not a very encouraging sermon
[1:02:48] tonight. Hey, there's some people here
[1:02:50] maybe that are bound up because they
[1:02:52] keep making
[1:02:53] mistakes. I'm here to show you we're
[1:02:55] going to make
[1:02:57] mistakes. Listen, this flesh is a
[1:02:59] mistake in and of itself. It ain't
[1:03:01] perfect. It ain't godly. He says he's
[1:03:04] going to make mistakes. But if he's
[1:03:05] really divinely called and God is in his
[1:03:08] heart, he'll rise again. Men, scripture
[1:03:11] says a righteous man, a just man falls
[1:03:13] seven times and gets up again. That's
[1:03:15] the nature of an overcomer. You can
[1:03:17] knock us down, but you can't keep us
[1:03:19] down. We keep getting back up. Why?
[1:03:20] There's something in us that rises up to
[1:03:22] every
[1:03:23] occasion. Sometimes we get knocked down
[1:03:26] real
[1:03:27] good. Sometimes we really take a beating
[1:03:30] and we can end up laying on our bed and
[1:03:32] we're depressed and we're worn out and
[1:03:33] we're tired, but eventually the spirit
[1:03:35] of God says, "Get up, son of God. Get
[1:03:37] up, daughter. We got things to do. We
[1:03:39] got place to go. There's a rapture to
[1:03:41] make. There's a body to support. There's
[1:03:43] a family that needs you. There's a body
[1:03:46] that's relying on you to be in your
[1:03:47] position. Amen. I've done many things
[1:03:50] wrong where I just got ahead of God and
[1:03:52] I
[1:03:52] presumed. I didn't go ask. I didn't wait
[1:03:56] for perfect leadership. Amen. And that's
[1:03:58] a big part of these things we'll find is
[1:04:00] presumption assuming that because we've
[1:04:01] been called or we've got a direction
[1:04:03] that we can just go ahead and do it.
[1:04:05] Amen. But I've learned I've got to be
[1:04:06] certain it's God's will and
[1:04:09] time and time. And then if I can do
[1:04:12] that, it'll work out. But otherwise,
[1:04:14] it's just a work of my doing. And guess
[1:04:15] what? I'll blunder and fall because of
[1:04:18] doing that on my own. It's still going
[1:04:20] to be a failure in those moments. He
[1:04:22] says this, "Remember, you backslide
[1:04:24] every
[1:04:26] day." Oh, what? Every day. He says,
[1:04:30] "There's no way at all for you to keep
[1:04:32] out of
[1:04:33] it." He says, "But you're constantly
[1:04:36] falling." Paul had to die every day. Is
[1:04:39] that right? He says he had to die every
[1:04:42] day. repent every day and just
[1:04:44] constantly repenting all the time. Oh
[1:04:48] my, what a wonderful Wednesday night
[1:04:50] service. You all better go home and
[1:04:52] repent tonight. That's all I got to say.
[1:04:55] Maybe we should have a repentance
[1:04:57] service cuz he says Paul had to do it
[1:05:00] every day. That's a church age messenger
[1:05:02] in the alpha church where Christ was
[1:05:04] revealing himself. What ought that to
[1:05:06] say about us, church, if we're in the
[1:05:08] omega? that we're going to make mistakes
[1:05:10] every day and we ought to be repenting
[1:05:12] every day for those mistakes. But don't
[1:05:14] get hung up on the
[1:05:15] mistakes and we're not going to get to
[1:05:18] Romans 8. This is going to be a downer
[1:05:19] sermon before we get to the high sermon
[1:05:21] of Romans 8. But Paul never stays in
[1:05:23] this condition. But it is a condition
[1:05:26] and it is a part of our daily walk as
[1:05:28] believers. Amen. Yeah. I appreciated
[1:05:30] what brother Barry said when he was
[1:05:32] here. He was talking about, you know,
[1:05:33] coming from a a home with alcoholism.
[1:05:35] When we were in the marriage seminar
[1:05:37] there, he was saying, you know, he's got
[1:05:38] to be careful because he has an
[1:05:39] addictive personality. He easily latches
[1:05:42] on to things and they can take over. So,
[1:05:46] he says, I've got to put guards up
[1:05:47] against that. This is Paul showing us,
[1:05:50] hey, we got to be careful in our lives.
[1:05:52] We got to be honest about where we're
[1:05:54] at. We got to be honest about the
[1:05:56] things. Listen, sometimes people say,
[1:05:57] "Hey, do you want to come over and do
[1:05:59] this?" Some of us need to say, "No, I
[1:06:00] can't handle that. You might be able to,
[1:06:02] but I can't." Not wrong, not right. It's
[1:06:04] just not for me because I've got a guard
[1:06:06] up and I can't do those things the way
[1:06:08] you do it. Amen. But what Paul's showing
[1:06:11] us is that listen, it's only the
[1:06:13] children of God that even have this
[1:06:14] battle in the first place. It's the fact
[1:06:16] that you're a spiritfilled child of God
[1:06:18] that creates this battle. Cuz people in
[1:06:20] the world walk around and they don't
[1:06:22] have this battle. They don't struggle
[1:06:24] with these things. Listen, they can they
[1:06:26] can know intellectually that I shouldn't
[1:06:28] do that, but there actually isn't a
[1:06:29] desire to take it away, to stop it. And
[1:06:32] so they keep failing and they keep
[1:06:34] failing and they keep failing. Amen.
[1:06:35] It's only the born again believer that
[1:06:37] has this battle and it's a daily thing.
[1:06:40] I've said read this quote before and
[1:06:41] I'll just read the one line. Brother
[1:06:42] Brham says, "If you don't believe you
[1:06:44] have wars, just get the Holy Ghost once.
[1:06:46] The Holy Spirit wants." Why? Because
[1:06:48] that's when the battle starts. Cuz now
[1:06:50] there's a battle for possession. There's
[1:06:52] a battle for dominion. There's a battle
[1:06:54] to see who's going to win and who's
[1:06:56] going to
[1:06:56] lose. And it's going on every day until
[1:06:59] this body's going to be changed. It's a
[1:07:01] born It's a divided kingdom with a
[1:07:03] born-again portion in the spirit of God
[1:07:05] in your soul, but that whole thing is
[1:07:07] residing in a body that is completely
[1:07:09] committed to sin and
[1:07:12] self and lusts and desires and all of
[1:07:14] these different things. So, we've got
[1:07:16] this daily battle going on. Whatever
[1:07:18] says about this this section of Romans
[1:07:20] 7, he says that's Paul speaking to the
[1:07:22] Romans. He says, "Now, let me just kind
[1:07:24] of polish it up so you can see." He
[1:07:26] said, "In me is two persons, right? one
[1:07:30] wants me to do and wrong the other one
[1:07:32] wants me to do. And every time I start
[1:07:35] to do right, then the wrong hinders me
[1:07:38] every time. So the minute you even start
[1:07:40] to think about it, much less do it, this
[1:07:43] flesh will resist. Every time you make a
[1:07:45] move towards God, this flesh is trying
[1:07:47] to pull you back. It's always in
[1:07:50] resistance. Amen. Every time you want to
[1:07:52] read your Bible or listen to a message
[1:07:54] or worship God or have fellowship, this
[1:07:56] flesh will resist because it knows that
[1:07:58] the closer you get to God, the more
[1:08:00] uncomfortable this flesh is going to be.
[1:08:03] Amen. We ought to know this now as
[1:08:04] mature believers. Most of us, this flesh
[1:08:07] gets very uncomfortable when you do
[1:08:08] things God's
[1:08:10] way. Amen. Let me say it this way. When
[1:08:13] it's 1000
[1:08:14] p.m. and you're laying in your bed and
[1:08:17] it's been a long day and you've got a
[1:08:20] phone on your bed on your on your night
[1:08:22] table and you got your Bible on your
[1:08:23] night table, the question is the battle
[1:08:25] is which one are we going to pick up?
[1:08:28] That's a daily battle, isn't it? If you
[1:08:30] haven't had your devotions yet and it's
[1:08:31] 10 p.m., your day is almost over. You
[1:08:33] got a choice to make. Do I pick up my
[1:08:35] Bible or do I pick up my phone? And
[1:08:38] listen, if you pick up your phone the
[1:08:40] next night, what are you going to pick
[1:08:41] up more easily?
[1:08:43] the phone. If you pick up the Bible the
[1:08:45] next night, what are you going to pick
[1:08:46] up more easily? The Bible. Amen. But
[1:08:50] it's a battle right there. Amen. When
[1:08:51] we're worn out, the last thing we want
[1:08:53] to do is maybe focus. We want to check
[1:08:57] out. But if you've had an experience of
[1:08:59] what reading your Bible does in those
[1:09:02] times, then you'll say, "I really need
[1:09:04] the Bible. I really need to spend some
[1:09:06] time in the word of God. I need to just
[1:09:08] slow down and talk to him for a little
[1:09:10] bit. Maybe put the phone away, be still
[1:09:12] and know that he's
[1:09:14] God. Sometimes we just need to rest
[1:09:16] there. When I wake up in the morning,
[1:09:18] this is something I do. You might find a
[1:09:19] bit funny. I set two alarms. The first
[1:09:22] alarm is to wake me up. And then I spend
[1:09:25] the next 15 minutes praying and just
[1:09:27] talking to God and setting up my day.
[1:09:30] And then when that second alarm goes
[1:09:31] off, then I say, "Okay, now I can get up
[1:09:33] and start my day." And that's just one
[1:09:35] way of me saying, "I'm going to start my
[1:09:37] day right. I have no reason not to
[1:09:40] listen. If I have to go straight to
[1:09:41] work, I don't have time to read my
[1:09:42] Bible. I've still started my day. Before
[1:09:44] I pick up my phone, before I check my
[1:09:46] messages, before I see who won the
[1:09:48] hockey game, I say, "Lord, I'm
[1:09:49] committing my day to you." And I pray
[1:09:52] for those special needs in the body that
[1:09:53] have been mentioned to me over the last
[1:09:55] couple days. And and I just say, "Lord,
[1:09:56] will you be with me today? Help me to be
[1:09:58] your witness. Help me to testify of you.
[1:10:00] Help me keep help keep me in your will."
[1:10:03] Just a basic thing like that. It's a
[1:10:06] decision. It takes away 15 minutes of my
[1:10:09] sleep. Maybe. But it sets me up every
[1:10:11] single morning. Very easy thing to do.
[1:10:14] I'm all about practical. That's a very
[1:10:17] easy thing that every one of us can
[1:10:19] do. But Paul says this, and I want to I
[1:10:22] want to read what Paul says here about
[1:10:24] how we beat it. How we beat
[1:10:28] this. That's what we need to do. We need
[1:10:30] to put a beating on these things. And
[1:10:32] Paul says, "But I keep under my body and
[1:10:35] bring it under subjection, lest that by
[1:10:38] any means when I preach to others, I
[1:10:39] myself should be a cast away." In in the
[1:10:42] uh Common English Bible, not a
[1:10:44] translation I typically use, but I
[1:10:45] thought it said this most clearly. He
[1:10:47] says, "Rather, I'm landing punches on my
[1:10:49] own body and subduing it like a
[1:10:53] slave." How many of us can say we're
[1:10:55] beating up our flesh? Now, some of you
[1:10:58] may say, "You know what, brother John? I
[1:10:59] don't do that so much." You know why you
[1:11:01] don't do it so much now? Because you did
[1:11:02] it a long time ago. And many of you have
[1:11:05] beaten the flesh. I'm looking at the
[1:11:06] older folks, the elders amongst us.
[1:11:08] Listen, the trials that you face now are
[1:11:10] not so much of the flesh. They're of the
[1:11:11] mind and the attitude. I think I think
[1:11:15] I'm getting nodding heads. But in our
[1:11:17] younger stages, that's where the flesh
[1:11:19] is the strongest. The guys are full of
[1:11:21] testosterone. The girls just want to get
[1:11:23] married. They want to look pretty. They
[1:11:25] want to fit in. They want to have fun.
[1:11:28] They want to spend money.
[1:11:30] Right? They've got it. They've got money
[1:11:33] to
[1:11:34] spend. And so that's where the flesh
[1:11:36] needs to be brought into subjection.
[1:11:38] That's where we as parents can show them
[1:11:41] what it looks like to live a life. I had
[1:11:43] a chat with my son a little while ago.
[1:11:45] He knows how much money I make now. And
[1:11:48] he knows that compared to what I make,
[1:11:49] how I
[1:11:50] live. And that's giving him a reference
[1:11:52] for this is what a believer does with
[1:11:54] their money. They don't live a life
[1:11:56] that's flashy. They don't go around and
[1:11:58] spend money on on on big things and
[1:12:00] fancy things. They live a life that's
[1:12:02] simple so that they don't live in debt.
[1:12:04] So that they can be generous, so they
[1:12:06] can help out when people need it. Not so
[1:12:08] we can live life for self. That's what
[1:12:11] we need to do as parents and elders is
[1:12:12] to show them what it looks like to live
[1:12:14] a life where this flesh just gets
[1:12:16] pounded and pounded and pounded so that
[1:12:18] it can't rise up. You know, the biggest
[1:12:19] thing they worried about is exactly what
[1:12:21] happened to the Egyptians. The slaves
[1:12:22] rose up. Remember what? That's why they
[1:12:24] put him into slavery the first time was
[1:12:25] they said, "Listen, we got more Hebrews
[1:12:27] than Egyptians in here, and if we don't
[1:12:29] bring them into slavery, then they're
[1:12:30] going to rise up and take over." Paul
[1:12:32] says, "This body is like a slave
[1:12:34] rebellion. You got to keep hammering it,
[1:12:36] otherwise it's going to come up and it's
[1:12:37] going to take over." The time to do that
[1:12:40] is early and
[1:12:43] often. It's a good habit to get into.
[1:12:46] Paul says, "I beat up the outer man, the
[1:12:48] flesh man, constantly. It's a daily
[1:12:52] thing." Now, Paul's a mature believer,
[1:12:53] and he's still doing it. Amen. But how
[1:12:55] are you going to beat up that outer man?
[1:12:58] How are we going to do this every single
[1:13:01] day? How do you beat up this flesh? How
[1:13:03] do you beat up this carnality that we
[1:13:05] have? We going to give ourselves a black
[1:13:07] eye every day? We're going to be
[1:13:09] standing there punching ourselves in the
[1:13:11] stomach? No, it's not that sort of
[1:13:12] thing. How do we do it? We deprive it of
[1:13:14] what it wants. That's how we beat it up.
[1:13:17] If you can weaken a person, they don't
[1:13:19] have the strength to fight. So, we got
[1:13:21] to weaken this flesh. Amen. We stop
[1:13:23] giving it what it wants. And this is a
[1:13:25] very familiar quote. I know you've heard
[1:13:27] it many times. Brother B says, "Here,
[1:13:28] not long ago, I was in the West and I
[1:13:30] heard of an Indian that got converted."
[1:13:32] He said, "How you feeling, chief?" And
[1:13:33] after a few days, he said, "Well, pretty
[1:13:34] good and pretty bad, just like
[1:13:37] Paul." He said, "What do you mean pretty
[1:13:40] good?" He says, "Well, since I got
[1:13:41] saved, there's two dogs in me. One's
[1:13:43] black and one's white, and they just
[1:13:44] fight all the time. The black dog wants
[1:13:47] me to do bad and the white dog wants me
[1:13:49] to do good." He said I said which one
[1:13:51] wins chief said depends on which one the
[1:13:55] chief feeds the most. He says that's it.
[1:13:58] I mean that's what repentance looks like
[1:14:00] in
[1:14:01] practice. You know when you're feeling
[1:14:04] when you're feeding on uh what you're
[1:14:06] feeding on shows if you're actually
[1:14:09] repentant or not. Because remember the
[1:14:11] scripture says that you're supposed to
[1:14:12] show forth fruits meat for repentance.
[1:14:14] And we sit there and we do we mess up
[1:14:16] and we say oh God I didn't mean to do
[1:14:18] that Lord. you know that I didn't want
[1:14:19] to do that in my heart. And then we say
[1:14:20] the right words for them, what do we do?
[1:14:22] We go back and we do it
[1:14:24] again. Listen, if we're addicted to to
[1:14:26] to drugs or alcohol or something, we
[1:14:30] don't just go to God and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:14:31] sorry. I've been drinking." What do we
[1:14:34] do? We say, "Lord, I'm going to get rid
[1:14:35] of the alcohol." And then what do we do?
[1:14:37] We go get rid of the alcohol. That's how
[1:14:40] you beat up this flesh. Now, that's not
[1:14:42] going to change you. But that's fruits
[1:14:44] meat for repentance. That's not a life
[1:14:46] change. That's not a new birth. But
[1:14:48] that's you showing that you meant what
[1:14:49] you said. Amen. So if we're feeding on
[1:14:52] the things that we said that we
[1:14:53] shouldn't do and we were repentant for
[1:14:55] doing, does it mean we're repentant? Not
[1:14:56] really. Because the actions don't match
[1:14:58] up with the words that we said to God.
[1:15:01] Amen. That's our duty is to take our
[1:15:03] faith and put it into repentive action.
[1:15:06] Amen. We're spending too much time on
[1:15:08] our
[1:15:09] phone. What do we do? Well, you can
[1:15:12] throw out the phone. That's actually a
[1:15:14] good starting place. It's talking to a
[1:15:16] coworker.
[1:15:17] He said, "My daughter is constantly on
[1:15:19] my phone. She is bound to her phone."
[1:15:22] And he was talking about how technology
[1:15:24] is going to destroy this world. And he
[1:15:27] says, "It's already destroying our youth
[1:15:28] because all they do is walk around doing
[1:15:30] this all day
[1:15:32] long. Some of us probably need to throw
[1:15:34] the phone away. Some of us can't handle
[1:15:36] it." So, well, I've showed before many
[1:15:38] of you the the picture on my phone and
[1:15:40] it says, "Do you need to be on your
[1:15:42] phone?" I got that from Brother Joe.
[1:15:45] I thought that was great. There are apps
[1:15:47] to do it. I had a brother tell me, "Hey,
[1:15:49] I've got an app that locks out my phone
[1:15:51] and I've got to wait 45 seconds before
[1:15:53] it'll let me in after a while." Hey,
[1:15:56] that's great. That shows that you're
[1:15:58] saying, "Lord, I really don't want to be
[1:15:59] caught up in this." That's a fruit
[1:16:01] that's meat for for repentance. You can
[1:16:04] say to your spouse, "Hey honey, if you
[1:16:05] see me sitting on my phone and you know
[1:16:07] it's not workrelated, can you tell me?"
[1:16:09] That's fruits meat for repentance. But
[1:16:11] that's not a change. That's addressing
[1:16:13] the symptom, not the root cause. But it
[1:16:16] shows you're serious. It shows you're
[1:16:18] serious. There's nothing wrong with
[1:16:19] those sorts of things. Amen. It's still
[1:16:21] just a band-aid, though. But Paul would
[1:16:23] say this in Galatians 5. We're talking
[1:16:25] about that beating up of the flesh,
[1:16:26] keeping it under subjection. He says,
[1:16:27] "They that are Christ have crucified the
[1:16:31] flesh with the affections and lust." He
[1:16:34] says, "Now, if we live in the spirit,
[1:16:36] let us also walk in the spirit." So in
[1:16:39] other words, if we claim to be
[1:16:40] spiritfilled and led, then our lives
[1:16:43] ought to reflect that. Amen. But unless
[1:16:45] that inner man is changed, you'll go
[1:16:47] right out and you'll go back to your
[1:16:48] phone and you'll go back to your alcohol
[1:16:50] and you'll go back to your cigarettes or
[1:16:51] whatever it is. Brother told me a
[1:16:53] hilarious
[1:16:54] story. He said, "I came out of special
[1:16:56] meetings one time." Now, he was not
[1:16:59] converted. Let's get that out up front.
[1:17:01] Some of you may know this man.
[1:17:05] He said, "I came out of service and I
[1:17:07] was so convicted about having a TV." He
[1:17:09] said, "And I had a nice TV." And that
[1:17:11] was back when TVs were expensive. He
[1:17:13] says, "I came home and I took that TV
[1:17:14] and I threw it in the
[1:17:16] trash." But you know what happened? He
[1:17:18] says, "A couple weeks later, I went out
[1:17:20] and I bought a bigger and a better TV
[1:17:22] and I brought it back into my house."
[1:17:25] Why? Because he was unconverted under
[1:17:28] the passion and the preaching and the
[1:17:30] conviction of the word. He did the
[1:17:31] fruits meet for repentance, but it was
[1:17:34] only a band-aid because the inner man
[1:17:35] hadn't changed. And so he went out and
[1:17:37] spent even more money to get an even
[1:17:39] nicer TV after
[1:17:40] that. That's what Paul's talking
[1:17:44] about. This flesh wants what it
[1:17:47] wants. And there's a battle every single
[1:17:50] day to get it right. That man had no
[1:17:51] power to
[1:17:53] change. There's nothing in him to do it.
[1:17:55] Amen. Church, we've got to have someone
[1:17:57] on the inside to fight those battles.
[1:18:00] Because until we get someone else, this
[1:18:02] kingdom is all together. It's all
[1:18:04] flesh. That which is born of flesh is
[1:18:07] flesh. You got to have a spirit birth to
[1:18:09] combat the flesh birth. Otherwise, we're
[1:18:11] going to be in big problems. Amen. Let
[1:18:13] me say it this way. You can't fight
[1:18:14] flesh with flesh. You can't take the
[1:18:17] will of this flesh and fight the desire
[1:18:19] of this flesh cuz they're in the same
[1:18:22] kingdom. In the end, they're going to
[1:18:24] butt heads. And guess who's going to
[1:18:26] win? The flesh. Cuz the flesh is
[1:18:28] fighting the flesh. Whichever one
[1:18:29] fights, it's going to win. And that win
[1:18:31] is always going to be a compromise
[1:18:33] because it's coming from the same
[1:18:34] kingdom. It's the same side that's doing
[1:18:36] it. Amen. We need a changing of the
[1:18:39] desires of our heart, not just the
[1:18:43] habits. And that's what the spirit of
[1:18:44] God is supposed to do in us. Amen. It's,
[1:18:48] you know, you look at coming into church
[1:18:49] and we can come in and hear the word and
[1:18:51] nod our head and say, "Amen." That's not
[1:18:53] going to change us. That's good. That's
[1:18:55] a good habit. That's something that
[1:18:57] every born again child of God is
[1:18:59] supposed to do. But that won't change
[1:19:00] us. It takes the spirit of God inside us
[1:19:02] to change what's inside of us. Amen. And
[1:19:04] then it cleans up that old nature and it
[1:19:06] starts to change us from the inside
[1:19:08] out. Now, it's a familiar thing that
[1:19:10] Jesus was talking to them in Mark 3.
[1:19:12] Remember he he cast out a devil and and
[1:19:15] they said, "The scribes which came down
[1:19:16] from be from Jerusalem said, he hath be
[1:19:19] elabub and by the prince of the devils
[1:19:22] casteth he out devils." And he called
[1:19:23] them unto him, and he said unto them in
[1:19:25] parables, how can Satan cast out Satan?
[1:19:28] And if a kingdom be divided against
[1:19:30] itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And
[1:19:32] if a house be divided against itself,
[1:19:34] that house cannot stand. And if Satan
[1:19:36] rise up against himself and be divided,
[1:19:38] he cannot stand, but have an end. That's
[1:19:41] why I say you can't fight flesh with
[1:19:43] flesh is because you're fighting the
[1:19:44] desire of the flesh with the mindset of
[1:19:47] the flesh. It won't work. It can't work.
[1:19:50] It's from the exact same kingdom. Amen.
[1:19:52] They're tied together. They're both
[1:19:53] broken. They're both sinful. And you
[1:19:56] might have come under conviction by the
[1:19:57] preaching of the word or looking at
[1:19:59] believers in the life they live. But you
[1:20:01] can't fight Satan with Satan because he
[1:20:03] won't do it. He'll fool you into
[1:20:05] thinking you're fighting, but really
[1:20:06] what you're doing is you're working out
[1:20:07] a plan to keep him in
[1:20:10] command. Amen. You cannot win flesh
[1:20:13] against flesh. Amen. The flesh
[1:20:15] ultimately will not do what it needs
[1:20:17] done. Look around. America is 70% obese,
[1:20:20] church. The flesh can't fight the flesh
[1:20:24] because the flesh always wins. And the
[1:20:26] flesh is broken and failed and it leads
[1:20:28] to death and destruction. It will give
[1:20:30] in to itself
[1:20:32] eventually. That's the way it works. You
[1:20:34] know this if you've ever tried to kick a
[1:20:36] habit on your own. It doesn't work. It
[1:20:39] may work for a while. It may work for
[1:20:42] years. But put yourself in the wrong
[1:20:44] conditions, the wrong time, the wrong
[1:20:45] season. And what happens is you just
[1:20:47] roll over and you go right back to it.
[1:20:52] Amen. What we need to win is to have
[1:20:55] another kingdom rise
[1:20:56] up. It's the only way it's going to work
[1:20:58] is another kingdom rises up and it kicks
[1:21:00] that one out and brings it under
[1:21:02] submission. Man, but watch this. Now,
[1:21:04] here's a real world example of this. How
[1:21:06] it comes to a believer today because
[1:21:07] it's not all about drugs and alcohol and
[1:21:09] pornography and bad relationships and
[1:21:11] all these different things. It's about
[1:21:13] doing what God wants you to do versus
[1:21:15] what the flesh wants you to do. many
[1:21:16] times. Okay. Brother Ram says this. Paul
[1:21:20] said, "With my mind," and he says, "And
[1:21:22] I have the mind of Christ." He said, "I
[1:21:24] serve God with my mind, but with the
[1:21:26] flesh, the law of sin." What is it now?
[1:21:28] Brother Ram brings it to himself. He
[1:21:29] says, "My flesh says tonight, you're too
[1:21:31] tired. Your throat is too sore. You've
[1:21:33] been out in the wind today. You shall
[1:21:35] not go to church tonight." That's the
[1:21:37] law of the
[1:21:38] flesh. I've heard people say, "Romans 7
[1:21:41] was Paul before the Holy Ghost." No.
[1:21:42] Prophet says, "This is Paul with the
[1:21:43] Holy Ghost. He's still dealing with hard
[1:21:45] times.
[1:21:47] Okay, that's the law of the flesh. You
[1:21:49] might just as well call him up and tell
[1:21:50] brother Neville to send the questions
[1:21:51] down and then tell him to answer them.
[1:21:53] He says, "But you see, I promise to do
[1:21:55] it." He says, "Now my mind on the
[1:21:57] inside, the Holy Spirit said, you keep
[1:22:00] your promise, but the flesh said, you're
[1:22:03] too tired." Paul said, "My flesh wants
[1:22:06] always to yield to that." And he says,
[1:22:08] "Your flesh does, too." He says, "But
[1:22:11] the law of the spirit of God in the
[1:22:13] heart overcomes the flesh and makes the
[1:22:16] body obey what the heart says do." Now,
[1:22:18] this is Romans 8:2. We're getting a
[1:22:20] preview of what's coming for service.
[1:22:21] So, if you like this, then come again on
[1:22:23] Sunday. I mean, this is where we're
[1:22:25] going. But there's a battle in the
[1:22:26] meantime. He says, "Now the law of sin
[1:22:28] and death works in your flesh, but the
[1:22:30] law of the spirit of life works in your
[1:22:33] heart." He says, "So your spirit," now
[1:22:36] he doesn't mean your spirit. means the
[1:22:37] spirit of God in your heart because our
[1:22:39] natural spirit won't do this. He says,
[1:22:40] "So your spirit in your heart will make
[1:22:43] your body obey what it says do." That's
[1:22:46] exactly right. He says, "Now that's what
[1:22:47] Paul said. Always the flesh. I'm too
[1:22:50] tired. I'm unable." Catch this. Oh,
[1:22:53] catch this now. Not just I'm too tired.
[1:22:55] I'm
[1:22:56] unable. Who tells you that when
[1:22:58] scripture says we've been made more than
[1:23:00] conquerors? He says I'm not sufficient.
[1:23:06] Woe is me. I'm too little. I'm too weak.
[1:23:09] I'm a nobody. I don't have what it
[1:23:11] takes. That's what the flesh says. Why?
[1:23:14] Because it's under satanic influence. He
[1:23:17] says, "I cannot do it." And he says,
[1:23:19] "Hallelujah." He says, "Look," and then
[1:23:21] he he he completely switches the
[1:23:23] paradigm. He says, "Look, this isn't
[1:23:25] just about making your body do what it's
[1:23:27] supposed to do." He says, "Then look, if
[1:23:29] it will do that for a sinner, then won't
[1:23:31] it work for that sickness, too?" He
[1:23:34] says, "The law of the spirit of God in
[1:23:36] the heart that knows that by his stripes
[1:23:38] we are healed. They stand with their
[1:23:41] power and make that sickness in the body
[1:23:43] obey them because it's a devil." He
[1:23:46] says, "There you
[1:23:47] are." He's saying, "Listen, this goes
[1:23:49] far beyond just making your body do what
[1:23:51] the spirit of God wants. It's about
[1:23:53] taking away the keys from Satan and
[1:23:56] booting him out of the competing out of
[1:23:58] the kingdom completely."
[1:24:01] Because you've got to remember that this
[1:24:02] body is coming to a time where it gets
[1:24:05] repurchased and put back into the
[1:24:07] kingdom of God. Amen. It's not just
[1:24:10] about letting the spirit of God rise up
[1:24:12] and make this body do what it wants to,
[1:24:13] but it's about letting the spirit of God
[1:24:15] rise up and claim back that which
[1:24:17] belongs to God. See, we don't look at
[1:24:20] this body, yes, it's not redeemed now,
[1:24:22] but it's going to be redeemed. Amen. And
[1:24:24] let me say again, this body is not
[1:24:26] redeemed now, but it's going to be
[1:24:28] redeemed. And so the spirit of God
[1:24:30] inside of us is preparing that kingdom
[1:24:32] body for
[1:24:34] redemption. That's why he still he took
[1:24:37] the
[1:24:38] stripes. You say God doesn't care about
[1:24:40] this body. God cares about this body and
[1:24:42] he's going to fully redeem it. But it
[1:24:44] starts with the healing of the body.
[1:24:46] That's the earnest of our full
[1:24:48] redemption. It's the earnest of the body
[1:24:50] change of the rapture is the healing. So
[1:24:52] he took himself and he held himself to
[1:24:54] the whipping post so that this body
[1:24:56] could enter the process of redemption
[1:24:59] that culminates in a body
[1:25:01] change. So it's not just about telling
[1:25:04] my hands and feet and mouth what to do.
[1:25:06] It's about taking back this entire thing
[1:25:08] for the kingdom of God because it
[1:25:10] belongs to him. It belongs to him. Amen.
[1:25:13] So there's a body for there's a battle
[1:25:15] for this body for our health, not just
[1:25:17] for our our general well-being in these
[1:25:19] things. Amen.
[1:25:21] We know that our soul was reunited with
[1:25:23] the eternal God by the indwelling of the
[1:25:25] spirit. But this body needs to be
[1:25:27] reunited with that eternal portion as
[1:25:29] well. And how is that? What is that
[1:25:31] eternal portion? It's our theophony. And
[1:25:33] that theophony is waiting there. That
[1:25:36] theophony is our victory, church.
[1:25:38] Remember the scripture says that this
[1:25:39] body will be swallowed up in victory.
[1:25:41] What is it? It's the theophony body for
[1:25:44] you that's waiting. That waiting proves
[1:25:46] that you're going to make it. By the
[1:25:47] way, that body is waiting because you
[1:25:50] are a redeemed son and daughter of God.
[1:25:52] It's been there since before the
[1:25:54] foundation of the world. And it sweeps
[1:25:56] down into this body and it brings it
[1:25:58] totally subject to the
[1:26:00] eternal. And you step into glory. And
[1:26:03] that's the last thing that happens.
[1:26:05] That's the last thing that changes.
[1:26:06] Amen. Why? Because this body is also
[1:26:09] belonging to God. But we got a battle in
[1:26:12] it while we're here. When what Paul said
[1:26:14] in Romans 8, and again, we'll we'll
[1:26:16] touch this next service. He says, "But
[1:26:17] not only they but ourselves also which
[1:26:19] have the first fruits of the spirit.
[1:26:20] Even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[1:26:23] waiting for the adoption to the
[1:26:25] redemption of our
[1:26:28] body." See, that's the fullness of
[1:26:30] adoption is when everything is restored
[1:26:33] back. Right now, we've got a soul
[1:26:35] condition that's been restored. Now,
[1:26:36] we're seated in heavenly
[1:26:38] places. It's an eternal thing. But this
[1:26:41] body has to be reconfigured. It has to
[1:26:43] be changed. And it has to be brought
[1:26:45] back because we've got to be made into
[1:26:46] his glorious a body like under his
[1:26:48] glorious body. That's what we've been
[1:26:50] promised. Amen. So this body is
[1:26:52] important to God. Yes, it might be
[1:26:54] sinful for now. It's fallen for now, but
[1:26:56] it's important enough that God insists
[1:26:57] that it brings he brings it back into
[1:26:59] redemption along with our souls. So it's
[1:27:01] caught between now our current condition
[1:27:03] and our future condition. And there's a
[1:27:05] battle that takes us all the way over to
[1:27:06] that future condition of full
[1:27:08] redemption. The changing of reuniting
[1:27:10] with our theophony to turn into a
[1:27:12] glorious body.
[1:27:14] Paul say this. He says in 1 Corinthians,
[1:27:16] "What know ye not that your body is the
[1:27:18] temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[1:27:20] you, which ye have of God, and ye are
[1:27:22] not your own? For ye are bought with a
[1:27:25] price. Therefore, glorify God in your
[1:27:28] body and in your spirit, which are gods.
[1:27:31] It all belongs to him." Amen. This body,
[1:27:34] it houses God. It's the dwelling place
[1:27:36] of God. And yet, this body is not in
[1:27:38] tune with God. But yet he dwells inside
[1:27:41] of it even though it's not agreeable to
[1:27:43] him. Paul says because the Holy Ghost
[1:27:45] dwells inside of you. Glorify God in
[1:27:47] that body. Bring it into subjection by
[1:27:50] the power of the spirit in your life.
[1:27:52] Live according to the spirit of God, not
[1:27:55] according to the spirit of death that
[1:27:56] lives in this
[1:27:57] body. Now when we talk about these
[1:28:01] things, I know many start to wonder and
[1:28:03] they say, "What's the difference then
[1:28:04] between the desire of my soul and the
[1:28:07] desire of this body?" Cuz if we're all
[1:28:09] honest, we know that we have some unholy
[1:28:11] desires at
[1:28:12] times. Listen, you may not be men
[1:28:15] lusting after women, but you might be
[1:28:16] lusting for retribution on
[1:28:19] somebody. You might desire to go correct
[1:28:21] somebody or hope that somebody gets
[1:28:24] their just desserts. That's not a holy
[1:28:26] thought. Spare the bride say, "Come,
[1:28:29] we're under mercy now." That ought to be
[1:28:30] our every thought is mercy and grace.
[1:28:32] And yet we have some very ungracious
[1:28:34] thoughts at times if we're honest. So
[1:28:36] how do we know what is a soul desire and
[1:28:38] merely what is the carnal nature that is
[1:28:41] stuck in this flesh that we have to deal
[1:28:42] with on a daily
[1:28:44] basis?
[1:28:48] Remember Jesus said or John said
[1:28:52] this because we can get caught up and
[1:28:54] this is where Satan beats us up many
[1:28:55] times is that we see something or
[1:28:59] something's presented to us and it has a
[1:29:00] draw to us and we think, "Oh my
[1:29:02] goodness, how could I do that? I know
[1:29:03] that's wrong." And yet there's a draw to
[1:29:04] it.
[1:29:07] And Satan will beat us up pretty bad
[1:29:08] because if you love the things of the
[1:29:10] world, we know what John said. He says,
[1:29:12] "Love not the world, neither the things
[1:29:14] that are in the world. If any man love
[1:29:16] the world, the love of the father is not
[1:29:17] in him." And yet things of the world can
[1:29:19] be presented before us and there is an
[1:29:21] attraction to them. Absolutely there
[1:29:23] is. Absolutely there is. That's what
[1:29:26] we've been talking about this whole
[1:29:27] time. Amen. It doesn't say though, it
[1:29:30] doesn't say don't be tempted. It says
[1:29:32] don't love. See, sometimes we take the
[1:29:35] fact that we are tempted to mean that we
[1:29:38] love. That's not true. That's not true.
[1:29:41] Amen. What is the love of God? It's the
[1:29:43] very attribute or it's the nature of
[1:29:45] God. It's the spirit of God within us
[1:29:47] that makes us love the things of God and
[1:29:49] act on that love. Amen. But if that's
[1:29:51] the case, then how can we even be
[1:29:53] tempted? If we've got the love of God
[1:29:55] inside of us and our love is towards
[1:29:57] him, then how can we even be tempted by
[1:29:58] something that is so far outside the
[1:30:00] holiness and righteousness of God? It
[1:30:03] seems that the desire to love those
[1:30:04] things would be completely contrary to
[1:30:05] God. And it is. But remember, this flesh
[1:30:08] has desires that cannot be quenched by a
[1:30:11] new birth
[1:30:12] experience. The flesh wants what it
[1:30:15] wants. The flesh is drawn to fleshly
[1:30:17] things. The spirit is drawn to spirit
[1:30:19] things. And the idea is you've got to
[1:30:21] overcome that flesh by the spirit. But
[1:30:23] it still wants it. Amen. So what's the
[1:30:26] difference? And how do I know which is
[1:30:27] which? What's a soul desire and what's a
[1:30:28] flesh desire? And if we think our soul
[1:30:30] des our flesh desires our soul desires
[1:30:32] and they're bad, Satan's going to beat
[1:30:33] us up and he's going to make us think
[1:30:34] we're not born again. We don't have the
[1:30:36] Holy Spirit. Pretty soon we stop
[1:30:37] fighting. We stop trying. We get
[1:30:38] depressed. We get useless and we can't
[1:30:40] do anything. And he's got us defeated
[1:30:42] because we are stagnant. We're not
[1:30:44] moving. We refuse to fight anymore. So
[1:30:46] I'll give you a few pointers here
[1:30:48] tonight, but we already read this
[1:30:49] important and it's what you think about
[1:30:51] and what you focus on is your soul's
[1:30:53] true desire. How do you spend your day?
[1:30:56] How do you spend your time? How do you
[1:30:57] spend your money? What do you actively
[1:30:59] pursue? If I could put it that way. Not
[1:31:02] what is presented to you, but what do
[1:31:04] you seek after? What are you actively
[1:31:06] chasing? What are you actively going
[1:31:08] after? What are you trying to get? What
[1:31:10] are you trying to achieve? That's what
[1:31:11] shows what your real desire is. Jesus
[1:31:13] would say this. He says, "Lay not up for
[1:31:15] yourselves treasures upon earth, where
[1:31:17] moth and rust doth corrupt, and where
[1:31:18] thieves break through and steal." If
[1:31:20] you're focused on that, you're headed
[1:31:21] away from God every single time.
[1:31:24] He says, ' But lay up for yourselves
[1:31:25] treasures in heaven, where neither moth
[1:31:27] nor rust does rust doth corrupt, and
[1:31:30] where thieves do not break nor steal. So
[1:31:32] there's a right way to spend your time
[1:31:33] and energy, and there's a wrong way to
[1:31:35] spend it. And the right way is for
[1:31:36] heavenly gain, and the other one is for
[1:31:38] earthly gain. Okay? One is wrong
[1:31:42] earthly, one is right and heavenly. He
[1:31:44] says, "For where your treasure is, there
[1:31:46] will your heart be also." So, in other
[1:31:48] words, what you're building up, what you
[1:31:51] are seeking, what you are working to
[1:31:53] gain shows what your soul's desire is.
[1:31:56] And if it's for the things of this
[1:31:57] world, then I'm sorry to say, you've
[1:32:00] either lost the really big battle or
[1:32:03] you've not been converted yet. It's that
[1:32:06] simple. It's that simple. Amen. Listen,
[1:32:08] we all need a house. We need a vehicle.
[1:32:10] And but if the provision for those or or
[1:32:13] or the seeking for those makes us not do
[1:32:15] what God requires again, we've either
[1:32:17] not been converted or we've lost the
[1:32:19] battle
[1:32:20] somewhere. Jesus said if you love the
[1:32:22] things or love the world or the things
[1:32:25] of the world and he's contrasting that
[1:32:27] against this loving the things of God.
[1:32:30] So really you say what is your desire?
[1:32:31] Is your desire towards the things of
[1:32:33] God? Then that's the nature of a holy
[1:32:35] ghost fil. If your nature is towards the
[1:32:37] things of the world, that's an
[1:32:39] unconverted
[1:32:40] soul. Fairly
[1:32:42] simple. The world keeps winning,
[1:32:44] something's wrong. Can I say it that
[1:32:46] way? The world keeps winning,
[1:32:48] something's wrong. He says, "The light
[1:32:50] of the body is the eye." In other words,
[1:32:52] what brings what what fills the body
[1:32:55] comes through the eyes. Says, "If
[1:32:57] therefore thine eye be single, thy whole
[1:32:59] body shall be full of light." So if
[1:33:00] you're looking at if your eye is focused
[1:33:03] on one thing and it's light, then the
[1:33:05] whole body gets that light. Amen. In
[1:33:07] other words, what you're looking at,
[1:33:08] what you're dwelling on, what you're
[1:33:09] feeding your mind and your thoughts and
[1:33:10] inspirations and desires shows what's
[1:33:12] inside of you. What you're feeding to
[1:33:14] produce shows what you want on the
[1:33:16] inside. Okay? Look at your appetite on a
[1:33:20] daily basis, and that'll tell you what's
[1:33:21] inside
[1:33:22] you. He says, "But if thine eye be evil,
[1:33:25] thy whole body shall be full of
[1:33:27] darkness. If therefore the light that is
[1:33:29] in thee be darkness, how great is that
[1:33:31] darkness? What are we looking at? What
[1:33:34] are we focused on? What do we do when we
[1:33:38] have free time and nobody's there to
[1:33:39] tell us what to do or what not to do?
[1:33:41] That'll tell you what's on the
[1:33:44] inside. That's your answer. He says, "No
[1:33:47] man can serve two masters, for either he
[1:33:49] will hate the one and love the other, or
[1:33:51] else he will hold to the one and despise
[1:33:53] the other. You cannot serve God and
[1:33:55] mammon. Someone has to win and somebody
[1:33:57] has to lose. Okay. Now, I want to say
[1:34:00] this and I've already said it, but I
[1:34:01] want to reemphasize it. The fact that
[1:34:03] you are tempted does not mean that you
[1:34:05] desire it in your soul. Jesus was
[1:34:09] tempted without
[1:34:11] sin. Without sin. And he was in perfect
[1:34:14] flesh with the spirit of God in him. And
[1:34:16] yet there was a temptation to go the
[1:34:18] easier
[1:34:20] route. It was tempting. He had no
[1:34:22] desire, but there was a what? There is
[1:34:25] an attraction to that mental if nothing
[1:34:30] else. Temptation reflects the
[1:34:33] flesh if you've been
[1:34:35] converted. What I seek, what I actively
[1:34:38] pursue, that shows what my appetites and
[1:34:40] desires are on a daily basis. And if I
[1:34:42] desired for the things of God, if I feed
[1:34:44] on the things of God, then I'm doing it
[1:34:46] because there's a desire for God inside
[1:34:48] of me. And it shows that there's
[1:34:49] something inside me that's changed those
[1:34:51] things. But if through all of that I
[1:34:54] live this outer shell of a believer, but
[1:34:55] all I want to do is watch movies and
[1:34:57] look at sensual things and go race cars,
[1:34:59] then guess what, church? I'm living a
[1:35:02] I'm living a lie. Why? Cuz that's what I
[1:35:05] used to want to do before I got
[1:35:07] converted. That's what I wanted to do. I
[1:35:09] was like a typical young man. I just
[1:35:11] wanted to to to look at women I
[1:35:13] shouldn't look at and have fun and get
[1:35:14] cars and be rich
[1:35:16] and but I don't want to do that anymore.
[1:35:19] Why? because there's been a conversion
[1:35:21] in my life. So if you can look at what
[1:35:24] you used to want and you look at what
[1:35:25] you look you you desire today, if
[1:35:27] there's no difference, we've got a
[1:35:29] problem because we're all born in sin
[1:35:31] shaped in iniquity. There had to be a
[1:35:33] change. There had to be a conversion
[1:35:35] somewhere. Every one of us knows what we
[1:35:37] used to be and we know what we are
[1:35:39] today. Listen, I I've known people that
[1:35:42] served the Lord for 30, 40 years and
[1:35:44] walked away in the end. I'm telling you,
[1:35:47] there were always signs in their life.
[1:35:49] And only they may have seen it, but they
[1:35:51] would have had an indication something's
[1:35:53] wrong. Cuz inside, you know what you
[1:35:56] want. You know what you do. You know
[1:35:58] what you'll do if nobody's around. You
[1:36:00] know what you'll do if if you have
[1:36:01] unfettered access to whatever. When you
[1:36:04] got downtime, nobody's around. Whatever
[1:36:05] that might be. We know what our desire
[1:36:07] is. And there has to be a conversion.
[1:36:10] There has to be a change there. And if
[1:36:12] there has been no change, then I'm
[1:36:13] sorry, we have not been converted.
[1:36:16] How can you be converted if nothing's
[1:36:18] changed? That's the very definition of a
[1:36:20] conversion is it's a change, a drastic
[1:36:22] change. Amen. You know, every year I go
[1:36:25] to Edmonton and and try to spend some
[1:36:27] time with my dad and we always end up
[1:36:28] going racing because that's what he
[1:36:29] likes to do. Now, I don't spend all year
[1:36:32] dreaming of racing. I don't spend all
[1:36:34] year looking at sports cars. I don't
[1:36:36] spend all year trying to get back into
[1:36:37] cars and those different things. I'm not
[1:36:39] always trying to see if I can fit one in
[1:36:40] the garage trying to scratch an itch.
[1:36:43] Why? because it's not an itch anymore.
[1:36:45] The itch is gone. I can enjoy it without
[1:36:48] there being the itch, if you know what I
[1:36:51] mean. Okay? Why? It has no power over
[1:36:53] me. It has no power over me. I will
[1:36:56] always like cars. It's something that
[1:36:58] I'm interested in. Amen. But I don't
[1:37:01] give it any power because it has no
[1:37:03] power. There's nothing in me that cries
[1:37:05] out to get back into that scene again.
[1:37:07] If I ended up with a nice car someday,
[1:37:09] I'd say, "Praise the Lord. Thank you for
[1:37:10] it." But if I don't, then I probably
[1:37:13] won't. Then it matters not to me. Why?
[1:37:16] Because there's been a
[1:37:19] conversion. I've had nice cars even
[1:37:21] since I got the Holy Ghost. And it
[1:37:23] wasn't that I had to, it's that I could.
[1:37:25] And I did. And I enjoyed it for a
[1:37:26] season, but I'm in a different season
[1:37:28] now. Maybe it'll come back again. I'd
[1:37:31] love it. But it's not something I'm
[1:37:33] looking for. Why? Because I'm satisfied
[1:37:37] with what he's given me. I've got an
[1:37:40] assurance that where I'm at and what I'm
[1:37:42] doing is pleasing to him and it's
[1:37:44] fulfilling to me. Sometimes those things
[1:37:46] are just filling a gap that needs to be
[1:37:48] filled by something of God if we're
[1:37:50] honest. Amen. So now doing some racing
[1:37:53] with my father is a choice and it's a
[1:37:55] choice of a very short timeline at a
[1:37:57] very particular part of the year and
[1:37:59] then I walk away. And it's not a bad
[1:38:01] thing in and of itself, but if I were to
[1:38:03] do it all the time, it would be bad
[1:38:04] because it'd be on the weekends. It'd be
[1:38:06] with the wrong type of people. It' take
[1:38:07] me out of fellowship. and take me out of
[1:38:08] the pulpit and take me out of study,
[1:38:10] take me away from my family. It's not
[1:38:13] something I can do all the time. And
[1:38:14] that's the way most of our habits are.
[1:38:16] Listen, there's nothing wrong with
[1:38:17] hunting, is there, Brother Matt? But if
[1:38:19] we're going out every other weekend,
[1:38:21] guess what? It's a problem. It's a
[1:38:24] problem because our family needs us, our
[1:38:25] local body needs us, our church needs
[1:38:28] us, whatever it is, these things are
[1:38:30] meant to take a distant, not even second
[1:38:33] place, fifth, 10th place in the things
[1:38:36] of God. I like what brother Barry said
[1:38:37] where he was showing he says first
[1:38:38] priority is God. Second priority is
[1:38:40] family. Third priority is is self. If
[1:38:44] you got any time left. I thought that
[1:38:45] was really
[1:38:47] good. And really if you want to think
[1:38:49] about it you got to throw the family of
[1:38:50] God in with family. And listen if we
[1:38:53] were con if we were so committed to the
[1:38:55] family of God we really don't end up
[1:38:57] with a whole lot of time for self. And
[1:38:59] that keeps us out of trouble. That keeps
[1:39:01] us out of trouble so many times.
[1:39:05] Listen, there's there's a Holy Ghost
[1:39:07] habit. When I was studying this, I a
[1:39:09] scripture jumped out at me. You know
[1:39:11] what we're supposed to have? We are
[1:39:12] supposed to have an addiction, a Holy
[1:39:14] Ghost addiction in this day. You know
[1:39:16] what Paul said? He said, "Forsake not
[1:39:19] the assembling of yourselves together,
[1:39:21] and all the more." In other words, let
[1:39:25] it be more and more and more. Get
[1:39:27] addicted to getting close together and
[1:39:30] spending time together. He says, "As the
[1:39:32] day approaches, as we see the end of
[1:39:34] this gentile age coming to a close, as
[1:39:37] we see the rapture getting closer, we
[1:39:38] ought to be spending more and more time
[1:39:40] together as believers, not less and
[1:39:44] less. I don't know about you, but I
[1:39:47] don't ever feel better than after I've
[1:39:49] spent a weekend and special meetings
[1:39:50] with the family of God." Just the the
[1:39:54] the you know how we spent this last week
[1:39:55] with brother Barry here and even that
[1:39:57] wasn't even the typical one we did. You
[1:39:59] know, we had a Saturday and Sunday.
[1:40:00] Usually we've got a Friday, a Saturday,
[1:40:02] and a Sunday and a fellowship and these
[1:40:03] things. But you come after that and I'll
[1:40:05] tell you, you feel so wonderful because
[1:40:07] you've had such a clean and and
[1:40:11] and just a the whole thing is wholesome.
[1:40:15] And I'm not sitting there having to
[1:40:17] fight with worldliness and and having to
[1:40:19] fight with people that are contrary and
[1:40:20] having to guard my eyes and this and
[1:40:22] that and the other. But because I'm
[1:40:23] around the people of God, I can just
[1:40:25] relax and we can encourage and support
[1:40:27] one another.
[1:40:29] I love coming out and I had a wonderful
[1:40:31] conversation with Sister Justine and
[1:40:32] Sister Selena about things that the Lord
[1:40:34] was showing them in their scriptures and
[1:40:36] the things that they were doing and just
[1:40:37] seeing them grow and mature and the joy
[1:40:39] on their faces talking about the Lord.
[1:40:41] That's a wonderful
[1:40:43] thing. I did rebuke brother Bob for not
[1:40:46] coming and talking to me the whole
[1:40:47] weekend
[1:40:48] though. But we're a part of each other.
[1:40:51] We're a part of each other. And he had
[1:40:53] things he was doing and I had things I'm
[1:40:55] doing. But we still connected in the end
[1:40:56] if only to rebuke one another.
[1:40:58] Because that's a part of being together
[1:40:59] as well, isn't it? Keeping each other as
[1:41:02] iron sharpeneth
[1:41:04] iron. It's all for our
[1:41:07] good. If we're pulling away, there's a
[1:41:10] problem. We ought to desire more and
[1:41:12] more of each other every single day.
[1:41:14] That's the cry of a Holy Ghost-filled
[1:41:16] person is to be more and more in the
[1:41:18] presence of the people of
[1:41:19] God. We strengthen one another. What
[1:41:22] does it say? A a thbound cord is not
[1:41:24] easily broken.
[1:41:26] you get in good fellowship, it'll give
[1:41:28] you strength. It'll help you go through
[1:41:29] things you couldn't do before on your
[1:41:31] own. It'll it'll fill up your Holy Ghost
[1:41:33] tank sometimes.
[1:41:34] Amen. But yet Paul at the end of this,
[1:41:37] and we're closing. Paul at the end of
[1:41:39] this in in in Romans 7 at verse 24, I
[1:41:43] want to read this and I want to I want
[1:41:45] to read it in the original and then I
[1:41:46] want to read it in the amplified. He
[1:41:48] says, "Oh, wretched man that I am, who
[1:41:51] shall deliver me from the body this
[1:41:52] death?" He kind of reminds me of David
[1:41:54] when he gets down in the dumps, right?
[1:41:56] But I love the amplified. It says, "I'm
[1:41:58] a miserable human
[1:42:01] being." Do you ever feel miserable,
[1:42:03] church? Sometimes I feel
[1:42:07] miserable. Really? You're a pastor now.
[1:42:10] You ought to be past that
[1:42:12] attitude. Sometimes I don't say it, but
[1:42:14] I sure think it. And I say, "When is
[1:42:16] that going to go?" Why? Because this
[1:42:18] flesh wants its piece of flesh.
[1:42:20] Sometimes it wants what it wants. Paul
[1:42:23] says, "I'm a miserable human being. Who
[1:42:26] will deliver me from this dead
[1:42:30] corpse?" Don't we just want that
[1:42:32] sometimes? Can I just get a break? Can I
[1:42:36] just get a reprieve? And the answer
[1:42:39] is no. No. You're in for a fight. Sister
[1:42:44] Sadie, how old was she when she passed
[1:42:46] away? 92? 94? 98. My goodness. And she
[1:42:51] said, "I'm still fighting every day." 98
[1:42:54] in an old in a Christian old folks home
[1:42:57] in a room shared with one other person.
[1:42:59] And she's still fighting Satan every
[1:43:01] day. Church, the battle's not going
[1:43:03] away. But you've got the spirit of
[1:43:05] overcoming inside you to give you the
[1:43:08] victory. We get weary of the battle
[1:43:10] sometimes, and sometimes God does give
[1:43:12] us a temporary reprieve. But guess what?
[1:43:15] We're not here to sit around. We're here
[1:43:16] to win. We're here to overcome.
[1:43:21] Amen. So many times, see, it's not just
[1:43:24] actions and looking at things. Sometimes
[1:43:26] it's our headsp space. See, it's not
[1:43:28] just about doing. Sometimes it's just
[1:43:30] about dwelling. What am I dwelling
[1:43:33] on? I had a situation pop up at work and
[1:43:36] I did not like how somebody had had
[1:43:39] responded to to a request I put in, and
[1:43:42] it was just very unprofessional. It was
[1:43:44] it was well below the standard that I
[1:43:45] expect for somebody in our organization.
[1:43:48] I was telling it to my wife and I just
[1:43:49] said, you know, whatever. What's what's
[1:43:51] going to be is what's going to be. But
[1:43:52] when I woke up that morning, they I
[1:43:53] started I didn't hold me up at night,
[1:43:55] but when I woke up that morning, boy, I
[1:43:56] started thinking about it again. And
[1:43:58] guess what it was, church? It was a
[1:43:59] total waste of my time. Total waste of
[1:44:02] my time. And I'm sitting there and I'm
[1:44:03] saying, John, there's no reason to think
[1:44:05] about this. But you can't stop thinking
[1:44:06] about it. The only way you can stop
[1:44:08] thinking about it is to start thinking
[1:44:09] about something else. And that's really
[1:44:11] how we combat these things is to get out
[1:44:13] of our own headsp space. We got to get
[1:44:15] into God's space and start reading the
[1:44:17] word and start singing some music or or
[1:44:19] start fellowshipping with somebody to
[1:44:21] get our head out of that thing that
[1:44:22] Satan will try and drag us into because
[1:44:24] he'll get us to dwell on the worst
[1:44:26] things.
[1:44:28] Amen. But Paul here is just showing us
[1:44:30] one side of this divided kingdom. He's
[1:44:34] showing us the hard part, the
[1:44:35] frustrating part, the annoying part, the
[1:44:37] disheartening part. It's there. It's
[1:44:40] there. And we've all been there and we
[1:44:42] know that it's there. Amen. But he
[1:44:44] doesn't leave us there. Amen. We'll go
[1:44:45] into Romans 8 in the next service, Lord
[1:44:48] willing. But yet in this fallen sticky
[1:44:51] carnal flesh of desires and
[1:44:52] inclinations, Paul would say this in
[1:44:54] Hebrews 10. He says, "Whereof the Holy
[1:44:57] Ghost is also small is a witness to us.
[1:45:01] For after that he had said before,
[1:45:02] brother Barry had read this. This is the
[1:45:04] covenant that I will make with them
[1:45:05] after these days, sayeth the Lord. I
[1:45:07] will put my laws into their hearts and
[1:45:09] in their minds will I write them." See,
[1:45:11] the promise is an inward work first and
[1:45:13] foremost. Then it translates into an
[1:45:15] outward work, right? The fir the new
[1:45:18] creation is an inside work, but it can't
[1:45:20] stay there because it's a creation. It's
[1:45:22] got to grow. It's got to express
[1:45:24] itself. He says, "In their sins and
[1:45:26] iniquities will I remember no more." He
[1:45:29] says, "Now where remission of these is,
[1:45:30] there's no more offering for sin. Having
[1:45:32] therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
[1:45:34] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:45:36] by a new and living way."
[1:45:39] See, under the law, it was not a new new
[1:45:41] and living way. It was a law of sin and
[1:45:43] death. We preached on this not too long
[1:45:45] ago. He says, "But now there's a new and
[1:45:47] living way which heath consecrated up
[1:45:49] for us through the veil that is to say
[1:45:52] his flesh." Remember what happened when
[1:45:53] he died was he tore the veil in the
[1:45:55] temple. And it was saying you can't get
[1:45:57] to God that way. But then what did God
[1:46:00] do? God tore another veil open. And it
[1:46:02] was the body of Christ. He says if you
[1:46:03] come this way, you can come into a new
[1:46:05] and living way that that old way could
[1:46:06] never do. That veil into the holy of
[1:46:08] holies can never change you. He says
[1:46:10] this veil of Christ, it'll change
[1:46:12] everything about you. So the inward work
[1:46:16] has to produce a new and living way. And
[1:46:18] it's based on changing who's on the
[1:46:19] throne of your life. That's what it is.
[1:46:22] It's changing who's in the control
[1:46:23] tower. Before was the law of sin and
[1:46:25] death. Now it's the law of the spirit of
[1:46:27] life. Paul says in Romans 8:2, Amen. Now
[1:46:30] it's the King of Kings dwelling on the
[1:46:31] throne, not just this flesh. Not just
[1:46:34] Satan sitting inside of this flesh. Now
[1:46:36] it's a way and it's a road and it's a
[1:46:38] highway and it's through the veil of
[1:46:40] Christ and now he's sitting there. And
[1:46:42] so now it's not about me saying or me
[1:46:44] thinking or me doing, but now it's about
[1:46:46] him saying and him thinking and him
[1:46:48] doing and him healing and him delivering
[1:46:50] and him leading and him guiding and him
[1:46:54] providing. And what is it? I'm along for
[1:46:56] the
[1:46:57] ride. I'm riding along on a ministry of
[1:47:00] grace, of mercy, of love. Now, there's
[1:47:04] work for me to do, but my rest is that
[1:47:06] it's him that's doing it, not in me
[1:47:08] that's doing it. And so, I know then
[1:47:10] that there's going to be victory over
[1:47:11] this flesh. There's going to be victory
[1:47:13] over these things that hurt that that
[1:47:15] that just kind of beat us up on a
[1:47:17] day-to-day basis. Brother, I would say
[1:47:19] this two quotes. And then the final one,
[1:47:22] he says, "Not the old way. What? Not the
[1:47:24] law way, not the works way." He says,
[1:47:26] "By a new and living way." That was the
[1:47:28] dead way, an order of law. But now we
[1:47:30] enter by grace through the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:32] nothing you could do. That's the most
[1:47:35] wonderful thing I could ever hear as a
[1:47:38] duty-driven German telling me you can't
[1:47:40] get there. That's a good thing because
[1:47:42] otherwise I'd be trying my hardest to
[1:47:44] get
[1:47:45] in. He says the law was works. Touch
[1:47:48] not, handle not, taste not, eat no meat,
[1:47:50] keep Sabbaths, new moons, all forms of
[1:47:53] worship what man did. But in this new
[1:47:56] and living way, it's nothing we could
[1:47:58] do. It's what he does for us by grace.
[1:48:00] We just accept it. Christ takes away the
[1:48:03] sin. We believe it. We hear the gospel.
[1:48:06] We believe it. Accept it. And then if we
[1:48:09] truly accept it from the depths of our
[1:48:11] heart, God gives us the Holy Ghost as a
[1:48:14] witness. I'll take that. I'll take that.
[1:48:18] He says, "Then the Holy Spirit witnesses
[1:48:19] to you that your sins are gone and you
[1:48:22] are dead to the world. You rise in
[1:48:24] newness of life, to walk a new life, to
[1:48:28] live a new life, to live in the power
[1:48:30] and the presence of God, not to be
[1:48:32] carried about with everything no more,
[1:48:33] but to walk after the spirit as sons and
[1:48:36] daughters of God. Romans 8:1 said,
[1:48:38] "There is therefore now no condemnation
[1:48:40] to them that are in Christ, who walk not
[1:48:43] after the flesh, but after the spirit."
[1:48:48] Oh, I love that Paul tells us all of
[1:48:50] this stuff we're dealing with in his
[1:48:52] flesh.
[1:48:53] And again, this is where we'll go to the
[1:48:55] next service. He says, "But that's not
[1:48:58] what we're dwelling on. That's not what
[1:49:00] has our focus. We're focused on there's
[1:49:02] now no condemnation for those who walk
[1:49:05] not after the flesh, but they walk after
[1:49:07] the
[1:49:08] spirit." What's he saying, church? Get
[1:49:11] your eyes off the flesh. Get your eyes
[1:49:14] on the spirit. Get your eyes on what's
[1:49:16] changed on the inside and then say,
[1:49:18] "Lord, help what's on the inside to
[1:49:19] manifest itself through the outside."
[1:49:22] Cuz guess what? It's going to take a
[1:49:23] while. It's going to take a while. This
[1:49:26] flesh is very
[1:49:29] resilient. But there's a victory coming.
[1:49:32] There's a victory
[1:49:33] coming. But don't let the fact that
[1:49:36] there's victory coming keep you from the
[1:49:38] reality that it's a battle every single
[1:49:41] day. Amen. It's a battle every day. If
[1:49:44] you're battling tonight, praise the
[1:49:46] Lord. Cuz guess what?
[1:49:50] 99.99999999999999% of this world ain't
[1:49:52] fighting. It's only the bride that's
[1:49:54] fighting and getting
[1:49:56] victory.
[1:49:58] Why? Cuz he's determined there's going
[1:50:01] to be an overcomer in this age. Amen.
[1:50:03] God bless you. Let's stand together if
[1:50:05] we
[1:50:06] would. Hey, we can be tough on
[1:50:08] ourselves. And I'll tell you this, Satan
[1:50:10] is really good at magnifying our
[1:50:12] mistakes, isn't he?
[1:50:14] Sometimes we can sit here and we can
[1:50:15] say, "Brother, it just seems like I'm
[1:50:17] making too many mistakes for a Holy
[1:50:18] Ghost fil believer to make." And that's
[1:50:20] what that's the accuser of the brethren
[1:50:22] trying to point you to the flesh side of
[1:50:24] this this divided
[1:50:26] kingdom. Brother Bram said, "We fail
[1:50:28] every day. We backslide every day." And
[1:50:32] it may not be the things you read or the
[1:50:34] things you look at or the things you
[1:50:36] say. Like I said, it can be your
[1:50:37] attitude. It can be these thoughts.
[1:50:40] whatever it
[1:50:41] is. But let me put it this
[1:50:46] way. Start looking at yourself through
[1:50:49] the predestination of
[1:50:52] God. Cuz here's the thing. When God
[1:50:55] chooses, God chooses
[1:50:58] perfectly. When God decides, God decides
[1:51:02] perfectly. And before we ever came into
[1:51:04] existence, he chose
[1:51:06] us. And we know God is perfect and he
[1:51:09] makes no mistakes. So that means that
[1:51:10] when he chose you, he chose perfectly.
[1:51:13] You are exactly who and what he
[1:51:18] wanted despite our current
[1:51:20] condition. He's changing us. He's
[1:51:23] bringing us into something better. But
[1:51:25] don't let your current condition take
[1:51:27] you away from the fact that this was not
[1:51:29] what you were at the start. And all he's
[1:51:31] doing is it putting you into a process
[1:51:32] to bring you back to what you were
[1:51:34] before the foundation of the world. This
[1:51:35] is a temporary condition. Remember what
[1:51:38] Jesus said, "A kingdom that is divided
[1:51:40] against itself will fall." God set it up
[1:51:43] so that this kingdom is going to fall no
[1:51:45] matter
[1:51:46] what. Abraham said one line as we
[1:51:50] close because if God chooses you, then
[1:51:53] his choosing is perfect. He says, "Now
[1:51:55] we know that human beings can make
[1:51:57] mistakes, but God can make no mistake."
[1:52:02] Remember what he said earlier? He says,
[1:52:03] "The flesh says, I'm not strong enough.
[1:52:06] I'm
[1:52:08] insufficient. That's Satan talking to us
[1:52:11] because God can make no
[1:52:14] mistake. If he said you're going to
[1:52:16] overcome, no matter how small, no matter
[1:52:18] how insignificant, no matter how weak,
[1:52:21] no matter how strong this flesh is,
[1:52:23] you're going to overcome. Because God
[1:52:25] doesn't make mistakes. God doesn't let
[1:52:27] his word fall flat. God doesn't let his
[1:52:30] word come back and say, "You know what?
[1:52:32] They were just too weak for my word."
[1:52:34] No, he'll raise you to the standard of
[1:52:37] the word. I love what brother Barry
[1:52:39] said. God takes the word and he breathes
[1:52:41] life into
[1:52:42] it so that it produces itself in you and
[1:52:45] I. Amen. God can make no mistake. You're
[1:52:50] here because he doesn't make
[1:52:52] mistakes. We make
[1:52:54] mistakes. We fall. We slip. God doesn't.
[1:52:58] And as part of his
[1:53:00] choosing, we're guaranteed. We're
[1:53:03] guaranteed for that expected end. We're
[1:53:06] guaranteed to make it. We're guaranteed
[1:53:08] to overcome that flesh. Hey, we've all
[1:53:10] got these little Sometimes they're big
[1:53:12] things, aren't they? We got these big
[1:53:14] things. I remember especially as a young
[1:53:15] man, boy, I had some big things and I've
[1:53:17] talked about them over this pulpit. Big
[1:53:19] things I thought, how am I going to get
[1:53:20] past that? And you know what I can say
[1:53:21] today? I'm past
[1:53:23] it. You know the Martin sing that song,
[1:53:26] it didn't come to stay, it came to pass.
[1:53:29] That's what this flesh is.
[1:53:31] It's here to produce
[1:53:34] character. Here to show that God won't
[1:53:37] be held back by this nature and this
[1:53:39] flesh. Here to show that his word will
[1:53:42] always do what it says it will do if
[1:53:45] there's a people that'll take it and let
[1:53:46] it do its work inside of them. Amen.
[1:53:49] It's here to show that nothing can stop
[1:53:50] the power of God inside you by the
[1:53:52] spirit of
[1:53:53] God. More than conquerors this
[1:53:56] evening. Let's keep our heads up.
[1:54:00] Look at ourselves through the
[1:54:02] word. Look at ourselves through the
[1:54:04] promise. Look at ourselves through the
[1:54:05] choosing of God and say, "God, if you
[1:54:07] chose me, that's enough for me. That's
[1:54:10] enough for me. And I'm going to take
[1:54:11] that and I'm going to run with your
[1:54:13] choosing and trust that you're going to
[1:54:15] get me through." Amen. God bless you.
[1:54:17] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:54:20] Father, Lord, we're in a
[1:54:23] battle. Lord, we're in a fight.
[1:54:29] But Lord, your word says it's not
[1:54:31] by
[1:54:33] might, not by power, it's by your
[1:54:37] spirit. And Lord, when you gave us the
[1:54:40] Holy Spirit, you gave us everything we
[1:54:42] have need of to make it out of this
[1:54:44] world. Lord, to defeat every element of
[1:54:47] this flesh, of this carnality, Lord, of
[1:54:50] this sinful nature that we are born
[1:54:52] with. Everything we have need of, Lord,
[1:54:54] you have
[1:54:55] supplied, Lord. And all you're asking us
[1:54:58] to do is by faith step out and believe,
[1:55:00] Lord, to act on it day by day. Lord,
[1:55:02] even I remember those apostles in Acts
[1:55:05] 4. Lord, they're put against the wall
[1:55:06] and they're threatened and they said,
[1:55:09] Lord, give us boldness to keep doing
[1:55:10] what you called us to do. Lord, I pray
[1:55:13] you give us boldness. You give us
[1:55:14] strength. You give us faith to lift up
[1:55:16] tired and weary heads and hands, Lord.
[1:55:18] that we take this sword of of the word
[1:55:20] in our hand, Lord, and just day by day
[1:55:24] keep fighting this
[1:55:26] battle, Lord. It's a work of time, but
[1:55:29] eternally it's already
[1:55:31] won. Pray you help us to keep our eyes
[1:55:33] on the goal, Lord, on the finish line
[1:55:36] that's already there, Lord, on a
[1:55:38] perfect, glorious body that's waiting
[1:55:40] for
[1:55:41] us. Lord, and help us to just say,
[1:55:43] "Lord, help me to walk with you today.
[1:55:46] Lord, help us win the battle day by day,
[1:55:49] Lord. Not look too far
[1:55:50] ahead, Lord, but just focus on where
[1:55:53] we're at, Lord, and say, "Let's let this
[1:55:55] giant come down today, and we'll face
[1:55:58] the others tomorrow, Lord. Bless your
[1:56:00] people. Encourage them, strengthen
[1:56:04] them, Lord. Give them faith. Give us
[1:56:08] faith, Lord, to take you at your
[1:56:10] word. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:56:14] Amen.
[1:56:16] Amen. Something keeps holding me.

[2:16:16] we learn something. It's all important.
[2:16:18] Mighty
[2:16:19] God, we fail you, Lord, many times. And
[2:16:24] no one wants to fail you, Lord. We
[2:16:25] always want to be successful
[2:16:28] Lord. But when we fail you, Lord, we
[2:16:31] just want your grace to remain with us,
[2:16:33] Lord, that there would a great mother
[2:16:35] eagle, Lord, flying over will come
[2:16:38] swiftly down, Lord, to help us, Lord,
[2:16:40] when we do fail you. And lift us up, oh
[2:16:43] God. Help us never to give up, Lord.
[2:16:46] This walk that we had with you,
[2:16:48] Lord. Let us never, Lord, to say we
[2:16:51] can't make it. You can do no better.
[2:16:55] That's right. Lord, time we can do no
[2:16:57] better. But mighty God, you've gone
[2:17:00] ahead of us, Lord. And the victory is
[2:17:02] already
[2:17:04] won. Even your bride says, Lord, that
[2:17:06] she has to get herself
[2:17:08] ready. But even your bride, Lord, needs
[2:17:11] help to get
[2:17:12] ready. We need your help, Lord, in
[2:17:14] whatever it is in life, Lord. In a walk
[2:17:17] with you, Lord, in this late hour, the
[2:17:19] enemy has come down over great wrath,
[2:17:21] Lord. Even you had to play with Ker Lord
[2:17:24] in his day. How much more Lord will you
[2:17:26] have to pray with Ker
[2:17:28] today. So bless you Lord. We just ask
[2:17:30] your grace Lord. Maybe Lord a little
[2:17:33] more of your Holy Spirit would help us
[2:17:34] Lord. Walk the
[2:17:36] walk someday Lord. We need that double
[2:17:39] portion. And we long Lord for the double
[2:17:41] portion
[2:17:42] Lord. But there's something we got to do
[2:17:44] too Lord. We have to be fervent Lord for
[2:17:47] you. We have to constantly Lord study
[2:17:50] your word Lord and prayer Lord and Lord

[2:18:34] willing, Lord, to sacrifice, Lord, for
[2:18:37] you, Lord, absur yourself into your
[2:18:39] hands. All these things help, Lord, in
[2:18:41] our walk with you, Lord, that you may
[2:18:43] have full control. That's the secret I
[2:18:45] believe Lord that you have full control
[2:18:47] of our lives and the battle gets easier
