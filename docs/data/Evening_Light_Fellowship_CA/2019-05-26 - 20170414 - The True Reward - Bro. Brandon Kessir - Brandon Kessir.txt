camp and they really liked it so I thought to bless you all with it - I really like this song it's called you're not a your God alone and I really like how I just expresses how God doesn't need us to be who he is and to be God and to be the supernatural powerful being he is [Music] you are not a god [Music] anymore you are not alone [Music] by your plan [Music] goody whose paw haunted building

[Applause] [Music] and all the Archangels [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] before here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise him worthy the lamb that was slain and the special by our sister Lily and thank the Lord a man for the revelation of God in the beginning was the self existing one a man by the grace of God and and well I guess she can use her guitar again and is like the sister one time that was there and the service with her family she took her one of our children her boy out to punish him and to get to calm him down but she used the hymn book so some of the Brethren said I was praying for the hymn book not for the boy but for the hymn book and so we're praying for sister Lily's guitar oh that was excellent that was good a man and giving praise to God hallelujah the self-existing one and God looks for not just the praise of our voice but what would those that have that gift he's looking for the praise to praise him on the musical instruments a million because that they're going to have musical instruments in heaven they're going to have musical instruments in the kingdom of God when we're back here by the grace of God amen and maybe our sister Lily will be back here at the time still playing the guitar a man by the grace of God so the Lord blesses and for this fourth of specials and may it be a blessing to our hearts and our souls amen so God ever bless you and just to say that it's our pleasure not to delay too long and to welcome my brother Brandon kisser and sister kisser from Alberta a man and I assumed they would bring good weather but they were saying that they had snow so we hope that they left it behind and because we've had our we've had our share a mayor and and even though it's free heat well they can still keep it a man and I guess the only thing that we would take would be the 10% and and maybe an offering so the Lord bless brother Brandon and our sister kisser and we welcomed them back to Newfoundland and we enjoyed their ministry when they were here before a man it was a blessing to us and we pray that and believe that it'll be a blessing to us again tonight amen so we have invited our brother to take us you know as long as he wants so he'll be an hour hour laughs and as I told him before I said I said he was less than an hour and a half I would demand a refund from him so we won't do that tonight but we thank him for coming and especially with his physical condition but let's believe a man this is what we call Easter time and Easter is is it's not just the resurrection of our souls and the new birth it's the resurrection of our in the healing of our physical bodies remember he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed amen soul body and spirit and as we have ministered many times before found that that the Alpha ministry was the redemption of our souls the Omega ministry is the redemption of our bodies by the grace of Almighty God amen so let's believe with all of our hearts with our brother for our brother in the going forth of the word let's relieve with all of our hearts with our brother and for him for his physical condition a man in your physical condition and my physical condition that with His stripes we are not wha not will be but we are as finished as the brothers today if I was I am so I am healed he said by the grace of God and we're believing to the change of our bodies and the prophecy if you can't believe for the healing of the body how can you believe for the change of the body so god help us is my prayer and we're going to turn the service directly to our brother because he's had a long day and a long night-in in getting back here to Newfoundland so I guess the only solution to that easy they'd had to move here so so the Lord bless him and pray God to bless the ministry of the going forth of the word we're gonna sing only believe let's stand saying only believe all things are possible as our brother Brandon comes to minister the word amen so god bless you just keep keep your mind on the Lord keep your the year of the soul old major not your ears forget them keep the year of the soul open to the word then in that I've been here we're more concerned about our ears and where are their are the year of the soul than in that Anthony are here with the Spirit is saying to the church if you let anybody hear what the Spirit is saying to the bright by the grace of God is to give us rapture in faith the reality of the rapture Amen so that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we are changed a man and cut away let's say can only believe as our brother comes to minister the word praise them and I said we welcome him god bless you amen hallelujah [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] tonight you know really we could all come here and just have a nice time of fellowship but all things are possible not because we're here and we have abilities and we've got ambition or any of those things but the only reason all things are possible as he's here tonight and he's here not because I brought him with me although I believe I did bring with me but because you all brought him with you as well so we're thankful for that and thankful to be here tonight back with you under the bright lights back home back home we have a little dimmer in the sanctuary but I appreciate that like turn the spotlights on ya make you feel welcome make don't make you feel exposed or anything and yeah you know certainly thankful for the invitation to be here and I've really enjoyed our fellowship and getting to know most of you pretty well by now so god bless you and but the poll one got married last time since the last time I was here so if I see this is your wife in the front here that's good god bless you sister Kimberly is it alright pretty nice to meet you and just get to see the Saints again they say sometimes that if you want to get yourself comfortable you should you know say something humorous I thought maybe I talk to you about cancer for a few minutes you know just kind of really settle in with something like man so you know of course you know and I appreciate the prayers you know last last Remembrance Day weekend was the last time that I went a weekend without knowing kind of what was going on with the COFF that I had for about a year and and really hadn't been hurting me or really causing that much trouble but friends are staying with us and they said you know it doesn't really sound good but it does sound like it maybe could be asthma or something and and brother's wife had had had a very similar situation like that and so I went to the doctor thinking maybe with asthma inhaler would it would all improve and and within a couple days found out instead that there was you know some mass in my chest and I went they in a couple weeks a week and a half I guess found out that it was it was cancer Hodgkin's lymphoma about a softball sized tumor in my chest and lump actually I should have put the picture on the on the PowerPoint but you know we're basically from my chest up into my neck it's a bunch of different tumors and stuff there but you know by God's grace I would think that I was most thankful for and that time is really that you know I've said and our thought many times that when faced with something that could be life-threatening you really don't know what your reactions gonna be and you really don't know until you're in that place you know brother Bob see you in that place and other ones I don't know your stories but but what I was most thankful for is that there was such a peace in that time and and and such a confidence in the Lord and I didn't I think we all you know we all examine our lives in those situations to see if there's something there but you know that we should be making right or something that that you know hindering ourselves but but I just felt such a peace that you know I was right where God wanted me to be and that if does you know we are sometimes put conditions on what would be successful to us and but really I believe being a Christian and really walking with the Lord means that we're accepting of all outcomes you know we're we're not just clapping our hands this evening because we think we're gonna make it to the morning we're clapping our hands this evening because if this is our last breath or where God wants us to be right and so you know I was very thankful for that and you know as much as you don't think about it I do think about it as a real blessing in many ways because you know sometimes we we hide our struggles or we hide the things that are going wrong with us and then we find that you know the people can't pray people can't break because I don't know there's anything wrong with you people can you know support you and and really the outpouring of love from the body of Christ has just been just been wonderful and beautiful and I think that Saints praying is what we're supposed to be doing so I hope that we're all praying for each other and not just you know when we hear about a certain particular per case particular case but which is really really thankful to see that and myself it's it's not that you think that today is your last day every day it does make you more aware that you're not indestructible and that really for any of us you know our time could end any moment and so instead of wasting as much time as we do it just makes us a little more aware let's do something with the time that we have so as you can see I've lost all my hair it's been a very traumatic and I say that but if you don't know me I've had no hair for quite a while so my eyebrows have thinned quite a bit so if I if I look at you and I seem to be paying extra attention to your eyebrows it's just a little eyebrow Envy but look at your beard sisters and I and I am be them it's just you know it's just because mine's not growing very well right now but but by God's grace he's been so good to us and I got into the shower brother Adams and the shampoo or the body wash whatever said head and shoulders and I thought that's that's really good doesn't say hair and shoulders the parrot about it says head that it's a perfect time for me got everything ready for me brother I don't we shaved all right let's try to turn our attention now to the word thank you very much the musicians in our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 very familiar portion of Scripture to us it's Good Friday and you know telling our kids that we call it Good Friday and what happened on Good Friday they crucified our Lord and you know what could ever be good about that you know and and it's it you know it takes a little bit of Revelation to understand why that was a good thing you know and but it was good because it opened up a way for us that never could have been opened in any other way and so it's not just a Good Friday but possibly the best Friday you know that that ever could have happened with was when the devil was foolish enough to put our Lord on the cross and to take his natural life so that we could partake of his of a spiritual life so we want to celebrate that as we should every day by making the most of the time that we have to come and hear the word and to and say Lord whatever you have for me it's certainly not that the bold guy up front there that's gonna give it to me that's gonna come from Almighty God so we just trust in him tonight Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 says now faith is the ABS or substance all right faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds which were frank worlds were framed by the Word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and then verse 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him bow our heads Lord Jesus this evening we just are so thankful for all that you've done for us in our lives Lord and we immediately think lord of the blessings and the great privileges that we have as sons and daughters of God but Lord we're also so thankful that in your mind you had a plan for our lives and Lord that you're not that you love us enough that you're you're not worried about what we might feel in the moment or what would bring us joy all the time Lord but you're concerned about what will bring forth character from our lives Lord you're concerned about what will mold us into your image that will give us the same character and behavior that you have Lord and that's the highest calling and privilege we could ask that Lord give us the trials that we need lord give us the strength to get through those trials that Lord on the other side we'd have the character we'd have the nature we'd have the all the attributes that you put in us Lord shining forth like pure gold and Lord we just ask that you would come tonight Lord that you would focus our attention and that you would anoint us father both to give and to receive your word and to to do it with joy and with expectations and I Lord as we commit all things I commit myself to you in each of the saints here in Jesus name Amen amen you may be seated you're likely you've heard this scripture many many times from a thousand different angles you know faith is such a key part of the foundation of God's Word and we see even by the words that are written here in in Hebrews 11 that it's not just conceptual it's not just an idea just not a theory but it's completely linked to our relationship of God you know faith is how we obtain a good report and faith is how we please God so it's very critical that we take heed and respond in particular to what this scripture is telling us you know but the service isn't you know specifically about faith but the part of verse six that says in order for us to even come to God we must believe that he is that he exists and he's a reward ER of them that diligently seek Him and so by God's grace tonight we're gonna look at this little thought of the true reward of course we believe we must believe that he is you know it'd be kind of foolish for all of us to keep coming to church and singing about a god that we don't believe in and praising a God that we don't believe in a giving credit to a God that we don't believe in for the lives that we haven't and so of course we must believe that he is you know but not just that he exists but that he cares that he has a character that's one that we can trust and appreciate and love that he's approachable that he has a provided way and that he will engage us in a relationship if we come his provided way you know and in order to have any hope of finding grace in his sight we must also believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him you know wouldn't it be a little demotivating to say the least if if we could labor and toil and struggle to serve God our whole lives and still think that at the end he would reject us and send us to hell how many people be like wow sign me up for the life of toil and uncertainty that you know at the end of the road I might not make it yeah that doesn't sound very motivating it doesn't sound it doesn't sound like you know you'd have much chance of doing it that way and we see some people that live their Christian lives that way you know they labor and struggle and toil and press and try and try and try and try and yet still worried at the end they caught a reject them still worrying at the end that it wouldn't be good enough that it wouldn't be enough and that you know somehow God and all of that would find some reason to send them to hell instead of welcomed into him them into his kingdom there's no faith there that's why it says it takes faith to please God you know what use the example of the parable Jesus gave with the talents you know the one that received the one talent he was afraid his his master had given him one talent because he knew he could bring an increase on one talents but he was so afraid and when he comes to the matter of the master comes to him at the you know when he comes back and is measuring the increase and he says you know I was afraid because I knew you're a hard man hard to please and hard to you know you know you you reap where you haven't sown and and gather we haven't straw you know and so I was afraid and I went hid what you gave me What did he say that he didn't say oh no you're wrong I'm I'm actually really easy to please and I'm actually really you know I'm actually really easy to make happy and you know you're not not tonsured know he didn't tell him that but his role as a servant was to have confidence to use what God had given and what the master had given him and bring an increase on it and so the master was happy to reward those who did something with what he gave them and so you know looking at that we have to believe we have to have faith look at this man he he had one Talent and you think one town what's one town but if you look at what one town of gold was like 25 pounds of gold was itwas what a talent was that was like millions of dollars in art in our time is what was actually put in his hand so he was given a fair chunk of money you know he wasn't given ten bucks and said let go do something with this here don't spend it all on play no he was he was given a significant amount of wealth and said go do something with this but he had no faith and so it paralyzed him to do nothing without faith it's impossible to please God he had to have faith because the master said I'm giving this to you and I believe you can do something with it and so in order for us to please God today and for us to you know do that we have to have faith that God's given us what he's given us he's given us his word he's given us attributes he's given us a potential that if we go and labor with it it's gonna produce an increase and it's going to it's going to please the father it's going to give us a reward one day and so we can't come in you know walking through those pearly gates are wondering if we're gonna make the rap drive sold out I've given my whole life but I don't know if it's gonna be enough that's not faith that's that's hope that's you know I play in the percentages I think that's gonna work now we have to come to a place of faith where we know we're on this path we're doing God put these attributes in me for a purpose because he knew it would be enough and if i toil and i labor and I do what I'm supposed to do with what he's given me he has no choice but to let me in because he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him the meaning of the word gospel is good news we forget that sometimes you know people think that like I'm coming to church oh boy what I'm gonna hear today how about if I get beat up today no the gospel they were supposed to be sharing is good news there's good news in and even sometimes in the worst beating we could get in church there's newse when your wounds heal and eventually you can see through those swollen eyes again then you know the Lord it's gotten more for you he you know he's he's rebuking and chastening because He loves us and that he wants us to fit the image that he has for us he wants us to be worthy of the place that he has envisioned for us it's good news to us the Word of God is full of good news and in particular three things that are more than just good God has made a lot of promises that's the first thing there's a lot of rewards in this in this gospel that God's given us then number two he keeps his promises you know it'd be great wonderful God makes lots of promises but I didn't keep any of them that would be you know awfully pointless you know he could make all the promises he wanted if he doesn't keep one that doesn't do us any good but he keeps the promises that he makes to us is even more important that he makes a lot of promises and then thirdly his promises are for you you know it's wonderful that God's made lots of promises it's wonderful that he keeps all those promises but it's got to be important to you he made them for you you know you didn't just make the promises for Adam or you know I'm Old Testament Adam alright you know or for Jacob or for Abraham or for you know different ones through the scripture he didn't just make them for Jesus or for the disciples or you know but he made them for you and and so all of the promises that God made not all of the promises that God made her for you which is good because you know some of those promises you probably wouldn't want to live throws through but the promises that God made for healing for salvation for the Holy Ghost for all of those things he made them for you and the scripture tells us that that God is immutable which means he can't change he can't he can't decide that you know what I made these promises for you but now I don't want to follow through on them he's bound by that word you know and I believe that God is not the kind of God that just like we are many times where we don't really think it through you know someone asks yeah we come help me do this you know yeah for sure these are to think like oh man busy that day do I want to help this person you know all of these things start coming to mind because we don't really process a lot of times and then we feel bad for making the commitments that we make and yet God doesn't do that God's not kicking himself today cuz he offered you salvation he's not say oh man I should have thought that through I find good if I gave that guy salvation they fell all these times I'm gonna really regret it no God knew every time you were gonna fall God knew every time you were gonna stumble God knew every time that you'd be crying out to him saying I'm not worthy I'm not worthy and yet he still chose you and he still made the promise to you and he's not trying to take it back today he's not trying to find a loophole to get out of it he still loves you just the same today no matter what condition you're in and he's gonna carry you through all the way to the finish God's rewards program is not cheap like the way the world does it you know it's not like collecting points on every purchase you know I'm getting so sick of the word rewards program because it just feels so empty most of the time when it's used that you know you go to the grocery store have you heard of our rewards program you go to the department so you know gasps you know are you part of this your membership are you you know part of this and and you know it's just over and over and over again it feels like you can be collecting points on anything you ever purchased but you're never gonna get anything for it you know what you get compared to what you spend it's just such a you know small value you know and I'm so glad that God's rewards program doesn't work like that God rewards Paul tells us are abundant above all we ask or think you know Jesus told us that you have not because you ask not not because your rewards aren't good enough you're not because you haven't labored long enough you're not because you haven't come to church you know faithfully enough but because I've given it freely you know when when my wife and I were first married we and we just passed 15 years this last December and thank God for her grace as well as His grace but you know we she already had an air miles like account started and I thought oh man she's already got a air miles account started like like mom she's really doing well in and so we had that here miles account for you know our first 10 years of marriage and and we're coming up to our anniversary thought oh you know we'd like to do something special so we booked a little trip to Florida and went on a cruise and I thought oh man these air miles we were collecting these for 10 years like that we must have just been stockpiling these things like crazy you know I never looked at it before I never even you know I never knew what the numbers meant or anything at all this must be amazing so you know you know cuz we use our credit card and we even you know people would you know the church sometimes that we'd purchase things for the church and get reimbursed like oh man people talk about these rewards it must be amazing and so say the oh let's check it out so after 10 years of collecting ear mouth we had enough for one ticket so my wife had a really lovely time so we both went on the ship but it turned out after all the conditions and fees and everything else all we were really saved was about a third of one ticket for one person you know just that you know we've spent 10 years collecting these you know you know maybe that tells you a little we make or spend in that time but but also just thinking like what are we doing with 10 years of our lives if that's all that we're producing you know and you know and I thought I'm so glad that God's rewards don't work like that I was so glad you don't have to serve the Lord for 10 years before you can redeem your points for a little bit of blessing you know I'm so glad that you know you can't you don't have to worry about redeeming your points for a little bit of healing you know it and say oh man you know here comes a disease in your life here comes a situation in your life you know you've got pneumonia let's say yeah you know well you know thankfully you know 50 percent of that is covered by you know by God because you've been serving him you know here's your points that you accumulated wouldn't that be horrible horrible way to serve the Lord but God's rewards are plentiful and abundant and you know you don't have to be a Christian actually I was kind of I was gonna say that you don't have to be a Christian for 30 years in order to access them but God's rewards are so good that you don't even have to be a Christian and many times to access them that's how abundant it is you know if someone will come asking him someone will come humbling the selves gods rewards are so abundant he healed people that turned around and walked back into sin no heal people that you know that from that day where were the same person they always were but they came asking in faith and he gave it to them how much more for his children who love him and walk in his ways you know God's God doesn't hide away in fine print even though our Bibles printing some pretty small sometimes but you know his he doesn't hide away in the fine print we would say or the exclusions you know some some restrictions apply they say in every you know ad for every good thing but you know God doesn't hide away in those things he has very clear terms and conditions and that's one of the things that I appreciate most God doesn't tell you that a Christian life is going to be an easy life and God doesn't tell you that a Christian life is going to be a simple life but he tells us that he'll be with us through every step of that and so Peter came to him one day to Jesus and said then Peter said lo we have left all and followed thee and he sent it to them verily I say unto you there is no man that a left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting you know a Peter came and maybe he was feeling sorry for himself that day or maybe Jesus had been talking about people that weren't willing to give enough you know people weren't willing to go the you know the full the full way and Peter wanted to tell the Lord Lord Lord we've given away you know everything we've given it all thinking that you know we've suffered well haha we've sacrificed a lot and Jesus turns around and said there's no man that gives without receiving a reward for that gift you know so whatever you know whatever you've given Peter don't worry there's manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting of God is a great mathematician but his particular specialties are adding and multiplying you know the devil is also a great mathematician by his specialties are dividing and subtracting you know and that's so that's what a descriptor says mark those that cause division among you yeah they're making it smaller right and you know so you want to we don't want to be dividing we don't want to be subtracting we want to be adding and multiply you know and God doesn't give you something for nothing you know God's Word never says you know just open your arms and I'll fill them with all sorts of blessings but God says whatever you give he will add and multiply that to give you a great great reward you know so so many times we're very carnal and we think that we hear that and we immediately think cash and prizes you know just like you know I keep the Jesus and everything was just wonderful and so you know amazing and everything just you know the milk and honey just flowed but it's it's so different from that and and so much better than that because he says he'll give us manifold more many times more as that manifold means and then what you started with both in this life and in the world to come you get everlasting life and if we really ever grasp the depth of the rewards we'd be content to never have another natural blessing just to know we have an eternal reward you know that that really is the is the you know the cake the icing on the cake Saul though you know the natural things we could possibly have that are temporary but the real cake the real meat of it all is that there's everlasting life you know a life without and you know you think this body is great when you look in the mirror maybe they go mad gods really give me a blessing here but you know but what what the real blessing is is that this bodies the cheap one this body is the lousy one then the body that come is the one that never gets sick that never gets old that never gets tired that's the one that we're striving for it so really all the blessings that you are craving on this side are nothing compared to what awaits us on the other side that's why Paul says you know the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be compared with the glory that should be revealed at us what a what a precious thing that is because if we ever really grasp that how could we worry about this oh I'm getting old oh I'm getting weak ah I'm getting so tired and discouraged well guess what this is the lousy part of it all the greatest part still awaits us you know that alone without anything else is is a greater thing than any offer the devil could ever make you you know Jesus said what would it be to gain the world and lose your soul that's you know the devil can offer you the world but you'll lose your soul but Jesus can offer you a life that never has you nobody it doesn't even end there you know after all of these things after all of these you know things that God's given us naturally and everlasting life on top of that there's still an abundance of blessings prosperity joy peace healing deliverance so much more on and on and on available to everyone that walks according to God's provided path mark tells the story here of Peter coming to Jesus again and should read it because there's one little difference as well maybe Luke was a little more of an optimist or maybe Mark was paying attention a little bit more but when when Mark tells the story he says then Peter began to say unto Him lo we have left all and followed thee and jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren her sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake in the Gospels but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life but many that are first shall be last and the last first you know when mark tells the same account he also includes the one thing we forget among the terms and conditions he'll bless abundantly even a hundred times what we've given but among all the blessings there's some persecution there's some trials there's some hard times there's some there's some difficulty that comes in and the main reason that comes is that the devil and the world will not just let you receive these rewards without conflict you know the devil doesn't see you just you know reaping the rewards of God's rewards program and say oh yeah that's wonderful let's celebrate that No you know yeah oh it does this put a big bullseye on your back you know and if you ever want to see people get you know you know Church even get hostile it's you know let someone really get somewhere and you know really whether that's naturally spiritually whatever let someone be you know really blessed and that creates more conflict than if someone was going through trial you know if you're going through a tough time everybody be praying for you can everybody be supporting everybody tell we love you you know it's god bless you don't worry God will bring you through this you know and someone gets blessed and you know ends like oh that's a nice car you got there but they're like wow yeah wow you know oh yeah well that was nice that especially saying there yeah you know I you a little off there you know just whatever any time someone gets blessed and raised up a little bit we actually have a harder time with that that fallen nature starts to rise up a little bit because the devil is jealous the devil doesn't want to see you prosper with God he wants to tear you back there you know the people your neighbors are not happy that God's blessing you because that brings judgment on them for the choices they made and what's what's happening in their lives and so there's a there's an impulse there and of course we know the devil sure doesn't want to raise up a Christian life as the one that's the best life so he does everything that he can to try to tear it back down so there's conflict that comes there but I love that God doesn't hide that away you know we can see right from the Garden of Eden that you know when God rewards somebody immediately there's some hostility you know God rewards you know able and immediately Cain rises up and slays you know that that tells you how much likelihood the the Devils gonna give you a pat on the back when God does something good in your life why because there's something immediately that tries to kill that off when God gives you a reward so so be aware you know we wanted God's blessing we've got God's reward it's not going to be without some obstacles there will be battles but there will be an abundance of rewards but let me remind you as I said before God is a multiplier it's a multiplication of what you've given it's sowing and reaping so because it's sowing and reaping a lot of it falls not only what are you sewing but how much are you saying so if you haven't been reaping an abundance of God's rewards you haven't been sowing and abundance you know don't blame anyone else for that they'll blend a pastor don't blame a church don't blame your family don't be response come play with children don't play parents it's up to you whatever you sow you will reap God is a multiplier you know this is all on you you know and and so sometimes we ask I go oh man you know what what's church gonna do for me today what's God gonna do for me today what's the body of Christ gonna do for me today you know but it like like JFK said you know ask not what this country can do for you you know that's safe same thing like don't ask what's God gonna do for me today well what can I do for the body of Christ today if you want to know how church is gonna be maybe spend some time frame for you want to know how the ministers service is gonna be spend some time praying for spend some time asking God to use a minister to help you today you know spend some time praying for the saints you know not just like oh man we're so into today but praying for them because you know they're sick we're praying for them because you know they're going through a difficult time pray for them because you know they're struggling and see what happens ask what opportunities exist for you to do service for God and for others and by that God multiplies those things to bring rewards in your own life abundantly how abundantly well Malachi the prophet got the word from the Lord and he said bring me all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of Hosts thus saith the Lord here if I will not open to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it I don't know about you our house gets a little cluttered sometime but there is still room for more blessings there's still more room for a few more good things in our lives right you know there's still room for why do we sing you know and it's tough I don't think it's about that but you know but you know so God God tells us thus saith the Lord prove me you know and sometimes we might think that's a little Cavalier or that's a little foolish but God tells us himself thus saith the Lord prove me you like to be challenged because God makes you a personal challenge right here in its word in fact it doesn't even say you have to be the bride to get it doesn't even say you have to be the elect doesn't is to say any of us think it just says prove me if you give me prove me that I won't give you an abundance that you can't even contain pay your tithes give your offering and God will multiply that to return to you a blessing that is so abundant there isn't room to contain it so if you want to obligate God give of yourself to his provided way to the way he's told us you know I'm not talking about the abuses you know brother Gerald's like Oh wonderful speech about ties tonight but that's you know that's not it God made this promise the NES gods rewards program you know and so I'm not talking about the abuses that churches have made pull in on the people you know give your life savings so the pastor can evangelize the world on a private jet you know give your life savings and we'll splash the name of this church all over the world you know give your life savings and you know I'll be on the front cover of every magazine in the country you know not that kind of nonsense I'm talking about a personal challenge from God and a promise that he will multiply what you've given you know I've gone to a couple of financial training courses and one of the principles that I've heard that I really like that is that big increases on little amounts are still small gains you know financial people always talk about percentages right you know yeah I put this money in the stock market a game twenty five percent one year it's like you know oh wow that's really good you know the banks on the offering like half of one percent or you know whatever sounds really good you know but but think about a five hundred percent return oh man that's a lot of money that's five times on ten dollars oh man you're gonna retire now aren't you you got Oh fifty dollars you know yeah five hundred percent return on ten dollars it's only fifty dollars you know it's not it sounds fantastic their returns are out of this world but the actual reward is pretty small and so you know God's rewards are the same you know just give the bare minimum that's so some people think I'll just give the bare minimum you know I'll just come to church when I really feel like it I'll just pray when I really have to I'll just read my Bible the bare minimum and there's a reason their life doesn't lack that their life doesn't have an abundance of strengthen and power and any of those things it's because God's trying to multiply even a hundredfold of nothing is still nothing I want a million times what I put in sure but you're putting in nothing so a million times zero is still zero you're not even the youngest child here probably learned that already it and so you know that's what you'd say oh man you know God's been blessing me you know surely he has you know but if you don't have anything it's because that's what you were given you know you you weren't putting it enough in for that multiplication to make a difference but what happens if we put in all we can't afford into the offering instead of just a small token and prove God not not proof you know anything else but prove God you know it's exactly what the word says in Malachi prove me you know you're 10% is God's money of course filling up the offering that's your money but what about our time our effort our prayers all of those things that we can do so much more in God's a multiplier of all of those things and so prove God and see if he doesn't take those things and open an abundance on you like you've never experienced before because he told us to do it the same way he said thou shall not he said prove me no the same way he said he's got you know mansion on the other side for you he's got a seat on his throne for you all of those things he said prove me if I won't pour you an abundance so that's the first part of this really you want to get more from God that's one of those things prove prove him by giving more of yourself not just your money your time your prayers all of those things but what God really cares about and this is where we get into the true reward for all the lowest things that God has promised to us he doesn't want us to be focused on those rewards God gives you all these rewards all of these things to motivate you and to excite you and to bless you and all of those things and for all of that God doesn't want you to be focused on those rewards the ultimate key to the way God operates and the major reason for every person who's ever failed in God's program is that none of these things even eternal life and a glorified body is the true reward God gives you the challenge to prove him but what he wants from you is your focus your attention your love and appreciation and everyone who has ever been chosen by goddess and failed has failed for that reason is that after a while they've lost their focus you know even from from Eve in the garden to Israel to the Pharisees to the early church to you today the main reason that people miss God is that they're not focused on him the brother branham tells a story as far as I could tell you only ever told it one time and he didn't tell it to a bunch of theologians he didn't tell it to the most spiritual people all around he told it to a bunch of kids that were graduating high school you know and just like Jesus parables I like brother Browns stories because there's more to it than just the story itself but you know he tells this story to a group of kids that's graduating in Tucson and in the message come follow me 1963 said little story one time I heard of a man who was all he was poor he always wanted to it's you know it's a little stick a fairy story like it always stuck with me though one day he picked a flower and the flower was magic and the flower answered him I know this is sounding very spiritual so far to the most spiritual people and brother Browns telling a story of a magic flower but stick with that he said he picked a flower and it was magic and the flower answered him and said you've been poor all your life he said now ask what you will and it'll be given to you the man said that yonder's mountain would open up and I could go over there in and find the gold in the well he said you'll have to take me with you wherever you go see you'll have to take me with you so wherever I am then you can ask what you will he walked to the mountain in the mountain opened up and he went in the shelves was full of gold and diamonds as the little fairy story goes he laid the flower down on a table or rock and he Rani grabbed a great big gem and he said I must go show this to my friends now I'm a rich man I have everything now I must show this and so the flower spoke but said you forgot the main thing so he runs back and picks up her well maybe I'll get a piece of gold I'll get a piece of silver and so he said ah I'll hurry out to tell the people how rich I am and what all I've got and he got to the door and the flower said but you forgot the main thing so he runs back again and he's sitting here we find all kinds of material so he picked up a stone he said he said I'll go take this stone and show the people what kind of stone this mountain is made out of so I can find my way back to it you know see and he started out the door and the flower said for the final time you have forgot the main thing oh he said oh shut up see he didn't want to hear it anymore forgot the main thing and he ran out the door and when he did the door closed behind him with the flower on the inside the main thing was the flower see the main thing was the flower and so my question tonight is have we forgotten the main thing the true reward because this isn't a fairy story this is the greatest story ever told you know that it's not about a magic flower it's about Almighty God who created all things and who formed you from the dust of the earth and who said that if you'll take him with you everywhere that you go he'll give you all that you could ever desire he's the main thing and have we forgotten it you know just like that man when we get what we want from God many times we just push God aside and we enjoy those temporary things that we have forgetting the one that gave us all of those things you know and when we think about it if he really is the true reward then if he took everything else away from us every blessing every thing that we enjoy every and everything that we trust in everything that we take comfort with you know in can if he could take all of that away could you still praise God could you still think God could you still serve Him if all of those things were gone because the truth is if you can't do that you don't have the right focus if you can come to church and clap your hands because you just got a raise at work you have the wrong focus because if you think if you can't come to church and clap your hands when you lose your job you've cut the wrong focus because whether God gives you at all or it seems like he's given you nothing he's still worthy of our praise because he's the main thing you know this is the absolute essence of God's character why does he why does he require all to be given but because he gave us all you know he has set the example he's you know one of the things they tell you about bosses and leadership is that you ought to be willing to do everything that you ask somebody else to do you know don't ask your employees to do something if you are willing to do it yourself and here God is the ultimate example of that because he never asked you to do anything that he hasn't already done himself he doesn't ask you to sacrifice without having sacrificed he sacrificed all for us and so he says from you that's what it's gonna cost from you - it's gonna cost your total your total focus and that might cost everything that you have to give you know and so if we take those two things I believe we're so much closer to the Lord if we recognize that God is willing to pour out an abundance on us based on what we give and then we're also recognized that God's requirement is that focus will be so much closer to the Lord every one since Adam has struggled with that focus because our greedy fallen natures are especially susceptible you focusing on the gifts and not the giver to focusing on the rewards and not on the reward err you know and even the very elect of God have struggled with that it's not doesn't it doesn't make you you know outside of God's program if that's what you struggle with because even God's very elect even some of the ones that we put the highest trust in in Scripture struggled with this very thing and I'll show you that right now you know Genesis 15 records God speaking to Abraham and God God speaking to Abraham is the first time that we get a glimpse of him sharing the true reward with somebody and he says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision and said fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward I am I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram the very father of our faith says Lord God what wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus Abraham is the very father of faith he's given us an example of what it takes to please God and it tells us the scripture tells us of course that abraham believed God and God counted that for righteousness but look at Abraham's response when God tells them what the true reward is God says I am the true reward and Abraham says what will you give me well I just told you that Abram I am the true reward it's like wonderful Lord but what rewards can I expect they you know Abram just doesn't get it because you know the package deal that when God says I am thy shield and the exceeding great reward is above all that Abram can ask or think you know it's a blows his mind to such a way that when God tells him I am your reward he immediately reduces it to something that he can understand and says okay but what do I get you know what do I get out of this and God says I'm your reward I'm gonna give you everything that you could ever imagine you know and yet Abraham immediately reduces that to something what's the reward what can I have how you know where how am I gonna get a son how am I gonna get an heir all these things he immediately reduces it to his own narrow mindset and yet God's trying to tell I'm everything that you ever need that's why Jesus said I am the way and the truth of life I am the bread that comes down from heaven I you know drink this water and you'll never thirst again what he's trying to you know any you read the interactions that Jesus had telling people things like this you know and and every time he tell them they totally misunderstand you know the woman at the well even you know this is the most confusing thing somebody's ever told her in her life when when Jesus says to me you know if you knew what kind of water I could offer you you'd never thirst again and then she says oh you know give me this water so enough to come back to as well you know like she totally misses the point you know or you know Jesus said unless he you know this flesh and and drink this blood there's no life in you I'm your reward essentially is what he's telling them and they say like oh that's so gross I don't want that I'm like you hear this sicko and they all left you know everybody turned away why because they can never grasp that over and over and over again God is expressing hi and you're exceeding great reward and they didn't want that they wanted loaves and fishes not flesh and blood you know they wanted a blessing they wanted some tangible thing they wanted you know and it reminds me as I'm saying this of the the survey they did years ago asking athletes that you know if you could take some kind of performance-enhancing drug that could never be you know detected and it made you the top of your game for five years but took your life would you do it and 80 percent said they would do it you know what does that tell you he tells you that temporary gains are really important to people short-term temporary gains are very important to people and they would sacrifice anything of long-term value for a few minutes of glory well Jesus Christ is offering us an eternity of glory and so many people are still so focused on the temporary gains and so even the very father of our faith when presented with God as the true reward immediately reduced it to something tangible temporary and yet he's the father of our faith we're still the spiritual children of Abraham because that he was willing to believe God and trust in him anyway David we know the scripture records and after God's own heart he was not above natural rewards in fact he was motivated by them you know if you read David's interaction as he goes to the valley or to visit his his brothers who are waiting to fight Goliath and the troops of the Philistines and you know David shows up there with provisions from his father and asked him about the battle and all those things and he hears Goliath challenge you know you know send me out a man to fight and and David hears that at first Samuel 17 records his response and it says David spake to the man who stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine who taketh away the reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God you know we talked about the faith that David had it you know you can feel that faith a little in the latter part of this verse rising to the challenge who is this uncircumcised Philistine but he started it by saying what's the roar like like you know you may not know that I've been anointed to be King and I have a lot of confidence in that and I'm gonna go out here right away and I'm gonna try to think of this guy but before I do that what's the reward you know just just asking like if somebody was about to do something you know like what kind of blessing could he could expect right and so you know David is very motivated by rewards you know when he hears all this it's like yeah of course I'll do this I'm in you know like what I get all of this stuff it sounds awesome and so you know he steps right up and God doesn't disapprove of reward or our desire for them that's why he gives them to us because he knows that they motivate us like I said at the beginning if you knew that you strove and strove and strove and you never got anything for it we'd be so discouraged we would never try it so God gives us a lot of rewards but he wants to be our greatest reward and the reason that we live and too often all of those rewards cloud that you know God's just so generous that we get caught up in those rewards and we forget that he's the reason that we live he's he's the reason that we exist he's the reason that we have any of these things and he's the only one that we should really be loving and trusting in and a focused on all our other ambitions and goals are to be second to that great goal of having him you know if we can keep our eyes on him we have no other path than one straight to glory you know how how could you miss something that you're staring right at the whole time you know it's it's when you look away right that's what they say about distracted driving there's not very many people that are you know consciously focused on the road and looking for obstacles all the time those aren't usually the people get an accident you know it's the people that are taking their eyes off the road their check the heater or the radio or check their phone or you know talk to somebody next to them or do all of those things at the same time you know that those are the people that are distracted their focus isn't where it should be and it doesn't take much to come along to catch them by surprise and it's the same thing if we're looking every day for the will of God if we're looking every day for what pleases him well guess what it's not that hard to find them yeah it's not that hard you know if we keep our eyes looking at him to see him you know a look and live as the scripture tells us but it's when we take our eyes off of him and God turns a corner what are you we're to God go I don't know where to find him anymore keep our eyes on him keep focused on him you know along the way we can live a life of abundant blessing and prosperity both naturally ends and spiritually and still battle everyday you know as David has said I delighted in the Lord and he gave me the desires of my heart sometimes people think that coming to Christ means that you're you're foregoing everything that you desire that's not true at all if we can keep our eyes focused on him and have the things that we desire then we can have both David's greatest sin was when he lost his focus man after God's own heart you know with this happens to this I was the good and bad elected and non-elected know he lost his focus he lost his focus and he committed more heinous sin than you could possibly imagine doing in your own life probably and you know it it came from when a man after God's own heart lost his focus the scripture says it was the time of year when Kings go to battle but this time of year David didn't go out to battle David stayed home and David had already accomplished a lot and God have given him rest rest we always say oh if God would just give me rest I'll be careful because in rest he close your eyes when close your eyes not focused when you not focus then bad stuff happens sometimes and so in this case David you know everybody else goes off to battle and David's got a little extra free time and of course this is a time when David takes Bathsheba and she finds out he was with child and has her husband Uriah killed off and so God doesn't let him get away with that although he does a pretty neat job of tidying up the loose ends it seems like but God sends Nathan the prophet too to David and Dei you know he presents a little allegory totally unrelated you know and then as soon as David gives his judgement about this this particular situation Nathan says to David for second Samuel 12 thou art the man it's you what we're talking about here that the you just gave the judgment that man should be put to death this is what you deserve he said thou art the man thus saith the Lord God of Israel i anointed the king over Israel and I delivered the out of the hand of Saul and I gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave me the house of Israel and Judah and if that had been too little I would have given moreover have given unto these such and such things wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of Haman what a judgment David had been a man after God's own heart he had been so focused on the Lord from a young man in all his life through his successes and his failures victories and defeats he had stayed amazingly focused you know David was one of those men you could say year after year after year in good times and bad you know as our sister I was saying you know he he had his eyes on God alone and yet when everything was going well when the battles were being won and he was established in his kingdom he lost his focus he forgot the integrity of his God he forgot the main thing he forgot the true reward and it caused David to take his own reward to make his own way here to make his own pride and when he did that he brought sin and judgment on his house you know I love what what God told David through Nathan he said I blessed you and multiplied you I gave you so much and if you would have stayed focused on me depended on me approved me I would have given you even more you know he said if this would have been too little I would have given you such and such the scripture doesn't say what maybe Nathan laid out for him all the things that God would have given him you know but I would have given you even more but you took your own prize you made your own reward you you got your own focus now you lost your focus you went outside of me to provide for your own desires you know the the positive is laid out for us all the desires of our hearts is possible but our focus needs to be right it must be subject to our greatest reward which is the love and the grace of Almighty God our Creator David brought unimaginable conflict into his life because of one lapse of focus you know you think oh man it was just one lapse of focus and then that one lapse of focus he brings such judgment down on his house sameera semeth 12:10 tells the the judgment here now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because now it's despise me and has taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against the out of thine own house and I will take the eyewash before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with their wives in the sight of this son for thou didst it's secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son you think wow you know David David reaped a lot for this one this was a hundredfold reaping on this particular showing that David did and and you know sometimes you might think oh man you know maybe your life is a mess of calamity and you might blame a lot of people for that one of the things that I've really changed in my focus is that I'm tired of excuses I'm tired of excuses of my own life tired of excuses in other people's lives because most of the time we really boil it down you know to our problems and our situations and everything else we can blame a lot of other people but maybe that blame should send her mostly on ourselves right on our own shoulders because we're reaping the things that we so you know the scripture tells us God is not mocked whatever so ever a man or so I thought shall you reap you know and so if it does lay on our shoulders and I'm not saying that you know extraordinary circumstances don't happen but if it lays on our shoulders as it does most of the time then the path is pretty simple like it was through David thoroughly repent and get focused on the main thing again because David refloating sowed and the scripture tells us that we will as well but what I love about God and just to show us there's never-ending grace is that if we get our focus back on him and we sow the right things God's able to bless and multiply in most cases the things that we do well to exceed those things that we've done wrong you know to exceed you know he can bless some 30 some thick 60 some 100 fold as he said and so I'm so glad that some of those negative things you know get blessed a little less and those positive things get blessed a little more and most of the time if you start to put the right things in place God will multiply those things to exceed even the things that that we've done wrong so as we begin to close here tonight I just wanted to read you some of the testimonies of the truly rewarded because as I said to me one of the greatest measures if you've received the true reward and means could you really have God take all of those other things away and still be content because if he's the true reward that means that you've really still got it all and so you know could we do that and David is one of those people who had that experience that when God could take it all away you know when he was suffering that reaping and when Absalom was taking the kingdom and when this one was rising up against him when this was happening when this was happening you know he did it he didn't wonder where God was he knew exactly where God was and he kept that benefited you know he knew that he knew he had put himself in that situation but I love what David responds here he says whither shall I go from my spirit or whither shall I flee from thy presence if I ascend up into heaven thou art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou art there the David had such a confidence that God was with him that God was with his true reward that even if he made his bed in hell most people wouldn't expect God to be there you know they expect the devil to be there but they wouldn't expect God to be there but Damon had such a confidence in God being with him that he said if I make my bed in hell they are with me you know though I'm sitting here you know on the run from Absalom though I'm you know just just a rivers crossing from losing my life and yet you know I'm going to I'm going to still put my trust in here this hell that I'm experiencing right now I know God still with me that takes a great great confidence and his walk with God you know he says in another place of course Psalm 23 said though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me you know and if you read a little further it says thy rod and thy staff they come from me rodimus staff weren't there to give him a big hug you know the shepherds were out of the Shepherd stuff we're there for some correction they were there for the odd beating they were there for a poke and a prod when he you know and the sheep's done wrong and yet David said they comfort me you know that sharp rebuke from the pulpit it comforts me because it tells me God's with me and he loves me and he wants me to draw closer to him you know size me has be closed let's hear the testimonies of some of the others who received the true reward job was one of those you know Jobe went through a great suffering so that God could show him that he was job's true reward you know Joe med had been given so many things he was such a respected man because he had wisdom and he had money and he had servants and he had to accomplish so much God took it all away and Joe proved that the character that was inside of him could still love God in spite of that you know could still trust God inside of the in spite of that and it says in job 120 it says after losing everything Joe arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped and said naked came out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return hither the Lord gave and the LORD hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord in all this job sin not North charged God foolishly twelve chapters later says though he slay me yeah well I trust in him but I'll maintain my own ways before him you know job the one thing job didn't understand is that he thought God was punishing him unfairly he just didn't realize what God was trying to accomplish right but but he said you know I'll maintain my own ways before job we've got a little more confidence and B did he knew he had done you know you've been faithful he'd been he'd been true but he said though he slay me yeah well I trusted him that's a that's a pretty harsh thing you know and in amazingly enough I believe that's what you're I the hittites testimony would be one day is that though David slayed him yeah he had a it was his pleasure to serve an army of David I believe he would say and that shows a greater character in Uriah than it did in David in that moment but that's that's really the the true character of a Christian is that it's not based on what God's does to me because God's given me everything that I have and then invert chapter 19 verse 25 it says for I know that my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God you know there was no written word for that job just wrote it right there you know there was no written word that said that he had that promise but he knew in himself that he would be with God because God was his true reward the Apostle Paul is a great testimony you know he Paul went through a lot of things you might say Paul had a great testimony and you know on the surface you might say yeah we would all love a testimony like Paul wouldn't we and then we start to think about what that would actually entail it doesn't sound quite so good because Paul lays out you know a couple times Paul lays out for us the extent of his testimony and it really doesn't sound that much fun he says of the Jews five times I received forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck a night in the day I have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness and watchings often in hunger and a thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness man Paul must have been a bad guy to reap all of these things well God told him and I'll show them the things he must need suffer right beside those things that were are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and I'm not weak who is offended and I burn not if I must need glory I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities you know Paul had a lot of things he could have been complaining about he had a lot of things that he could have been crying about you know I sure hope that God you know remembers me and all of his terrible things that I'm going through but Romans chapter 8 verse 37 tells us what what Paul really thought after going through all of those things he said nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our what a man who had gone through all of those things to realize that there is absolutely nothing that can separate you from the love of God what a confidence you know and that's one thing I would say is that you know having to go through something I don't understand all the time or that I don't I don't know which way it's going to turn out yet I just trusting in God's faithfulness to me and and whatever way he wants that's the way I want to go but but but what you realize is when you're willing to accept God's will in all situations it doesn't matter how good things are going for you to still be able to say the same thing that I know that God's there with me no matter what what the situation is brother Brown tells us a story he's one of those ones that lent his voice to say that no matter what God does I'll still take him he says in his citizen Grand Prairie actually Alberta in 1961 it is I he said but I might not live to hear that but there's one thing I do want to hear and I believe I'll hear it it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord that's what I'm expecting to hear someday I'm sure he won't disappoint me so we could stop right there and say you know he's got faith that God is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him but it shows you how much he sold out to the true reward by this next paragraph and he says and if he does turn me down at the end of the road I'll still love him if he sends me to hell and I can still love in hell I'll love him anyhow see because I deserve to be turned down at the beginning see and if I had 10,000 lives to live this is such a profound statement if I had 10,000 lives to live and there's nothing after the end of them if there was no God no Christ I'd still take this Christian way to live anyhow there's a man that his life is made of the very fiber of God's work and that's what I'd say to you tonight is that you know compared to these ones in the scripture I'm nothing and I'm nobody but I believe that with all my heart that if you took it all away if we took everything all the blessings if there was no more rewards other than himself I still stand in praising Hebrews 11:6 without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him but seek ye first the kingdom of God six and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you he's a rewarder he'd be faithful to us through to the end but our attention our love everything else needs to be concentrated on him Jesus parable of the man who found a treasure in a field it says he went and sold everything he had to buy that treasure you know and God is you know God himself Jesus Christ is the example of that parable because you know he found a treasure in an earthen vessel you know he saw treasures in in our lives he saw you know deposits of himself that he put in our lives and he went and gave everything he had his very life on Calvary to obtain that treasure but that parable also applies to us you know we're digging around in this field of this earth and we found a treasure we found Almighty God we found we found in this message in this word in his life that there's there's an everlasting life there's a spirit of god there's a Holy Ghost to be found and so that the compulsion in our lives is sell everything that you guys there's one true reward it might be a bunch of other fringe benefits but there's one true reward well we sell all that we have and we might find that one treasure a man let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father you are our true reward and Lord should we suffer should we be blessed Lord we can say that through it all though you slay us yet we'll trust in you lord the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord Lord if you take it all away if at the end of the journey you would still send us away Lord we don't believe you will because you're a rewarder of those that diligently seek you but Lord we'll love you anyhow will serve you anyhow Lord it father we just are so grateful for the life the breath that you put in these bodies Lord we thank you that there's an opportunity to be a reflection of your will and your way to this world and I pray father then we could see on this Good Friday that that you did not die in vain that you did not die without reward coming to you Lord but we humble people here tonight though we're part of that reaping that you sowed when you that corn of wheat fell on the ground over a part of that harvest that's grown up to be a reflection of your very character and life Lord and we're so grateful for the sacrifice you made so we could be here today praising you Lord so we could be here today living for you father make me you make us so aware that we would treasure every moment that we would look to make more of our time Lord that we would look more to make more of our walk with you Lord realizing that that's the most important thing father we just thank you for these things thank you for the lives that came here tonight and we're so attentive Lord and I pray you'd bless them abundantly Lord and in blessings and trials or whatever it takes to bring them into the position you have in mind for them Lord we commit each one into your care in Jesus name and let's stand together sing I love him I love him because he first loved me if you hadn't first loved us we wouldn't be here you know if he hadn't first loved us we wouldn't know the grace that he has but because he did and because he you know before we even started down the journey we already knew we already knew he'd gone and saved our souls we already knew you'd already have a place prepared for us it's been working on right on along for a long time but one day we're gonna be with him there for [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] stay overtime as brother Gerald carbs [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] love him from your show [Music] Alleluia [Music] the inside [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah well her brother Brandon never said a word it was the Lord as the truth I believe it was the Holy Ghost anointing our brother and using the brothers voice using from his heart to bring forth the word and the true reward a definite confirmation a definite confirmation of the revelation of God's predestinated plane a man of the foreknowledge of God of the election of God a man that's good I've got three or four pages they're notes I'm not allowed to go very far tonight just to give you his own rest them rest to her brother Brandon a man but I want to thank God for the word and it was thus saith the Lord it wasn't thus say a brother Brandon and it's not again to us say it William Branham it is thus saith the Lord it was God in his servants it was God in Paul it was God in Abraham is God in US speaking forth is word is revelation of himself the grace of God and it was good to be reminded of the thing and we needed to be reminded of it most definitely we need to really remind don't let don't lose your focus we're living in a world that's losing its focus a man they'd lost their focus in Luther's day they lost their focus in Wesley's day in the and in the Pentecostal agent you know they in all other revivals that God had they lost the focus God wanted them to focused on this than they did under I just become a just become a doctrine to become a Creed withers in Luther's day West we stay the Pentecostal age and other revivals so there's now an A in the our that we're living and in the message that we're living under that is that the people are losing their focus on what God has done and losing their focus on what God is doing amen we need to get into the into the revelation of the ever-present God amen we believe what he has done and we believe what he's going to do but is he doing it amen let's let's let's get our focus back in line with the scriptures let's get our focus back in line with what God is doing Amen so that we are by the grace of God we are walking in the spirit we are living in the spirit not the walked in it and will not lived in it and will but we are by the grace of God and if you are living in the spirit if you're walking in the spirit then you've got the revelation that God has spoken to you tonight God has spoken to your heart tonight a main the main ninten your focus in what he is doing Amen by the grace of God what he's done is to bring us to this place I like it he mentioned David there a man he was a young man anointed a united the king over Israel praise the Lord about a reward and then and then asking what's the reward going to be if you say if I defeat Goliath what you mean don't tell me that the whole nation and the whole army of Israel couldn't defeat them but here stands this young man a shepherd boy a shepherd boy and says what what what reward will I get you know whoever gets it over goes out of there and conquer Scalia a man we got Goliath so there amen don't don't you it don't you think no there's no goliaths there's like a lieth right in your life in your flesh Amen my flesh dwelleth no good thing and without him and within me can do nothing by the grace of God and David knew that David knew that God was with him that's good brother amen the kind of little little revelation strike home to us because it was David that knew the Lord was with him and then and he played his harp and he worshiped God any man hallelujah II had faith that's wonderful brothers sisters don't forget and meditate on a dwell on it the faith that that young man had and if God required God to I appreciated the head in him wanted to go what would God are expecting us amen in this hour seeing what God has done in the enemy in the Ministry of Malachi 4 and so on and what God has done in our lives and is doing in our lives Oh God give us that faith oh let us save that faith just think of it a young man what's going on here amen and no day they would think you're crazy you're you're insane you're just a boy what do you what everybody would you come here to make make fun of us and make us look look and look foolish in the eyes of the world they want to make him look foolish you know and says you know here's old all the hell the whole nation the whole army and they can't go to defeat that that made them there because they were good they were they lost their focus on God that's the truth brother they lost their focus on God who could conquer any enemy amen David didn't hallelujah he listened that they should have realized what God had done to Israel and what God was doing with Israel as David remember what God had done with him a man he was not a king over Israel he was as as a young man but he said God delivered me out of the line out of the hand of the jaw the mouth of the lion and the paws of the bear and what about this Scalia well the bear had no sword the veteran of the berry and the lion had no shields and none of these things but still that didn't matter today but a man you know why he was because David David was identified with the covenant of abraham a mani and the token here the token and he believed God any anybody think he never lost the focus on on on the Covenant and the token a made a God that was with Abraham was was with David amen the God delivered Abraham would deliver David praise the name of the Lord God elbows rather just to think that young man he believed that David you got to be crazy we're all the net all the armies of Israel and and you you think you could go down there and we can't a man you got to go down by faith don't take the modern ways of this world because as I said Satan this again we're back to Eden again and Satan that is getting us to trying to get us to the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen that's what's going on instead of believing God trusting God good brother getting brought out about Cain and Abel amen that you've got to take your stand as Abel took in Spain but it but it's going to going to bring problems oh yeah he said God he said God God rewards someone and it causes hostility is that what you said yeah God reward somebody and causes hostility I got a reward David got a you know and David went out and gave his testimony and they became out our style toward David they were even in even his own family and so on but he stayed with the promise amen by the grace of Almighty God and it says it was like Abel and Cain God read God rewarded Abel why isn't it God God took your sacrifice and wouldn't take mine this is right Saints has got to be according to the will of God and a right spirit and a right attitude that's what God looks for anybody no matter how much we say we believe is we believe that and we believe something else you got to have the right attitude and right spirit amen because that's what brings God on the scene a man and gives us faith all brother don't please I beg of you in the name of the Lord let the holy spirit bring to your remembrance tonight let's Holy Spirit bring to your remembrance tomorrow what our brother ministered to us tonight what God gave us God sent him here it was predestinated thousands of years ago God for attainted God knew was going to be brother maybe the brother to wait on the Lord to know what the breach and God already knew it a man before the brother came into existence before any must came into existence God knew what our brother Brandon was going to breach and say Amen it was God going to be God in him it was what it was faith it was his faith in God getting himself out of the way so Jesus could speak a man so god help us brother by grace to believe to have that faith that was a wonderful wonderful examples of faith a man do you have that faith order you works it out you do this you do that you planned this you planned that are we led by the spirit as David was as Abel was as the other Saints in the scriptures did Joel there's like I said we can barely do with one funeral Joel bed I said seven one time Joel bed Cain yeah you question God why God it's just like when my brother just passed away just a couple of weeks ago and and somebody they're standing at the coffin said why why did he go so young how old was he 72 and they want to know why why why would you know why would God take him at such a young age you know where's faith trusting the Lord leave it with the Lord committed to the Lord job and again I was thinking about it when when I heard that question and I was I didn't I I felt as if to say it but I didn't say anything I thought well I said lord I was your servant job at 10 funerals in one time and only that all brother comes right back to what our brothers saying oh my oh my what God gives and what God doesn't give that was good that was good just think God give this 110 this whole five or five whatever and this one one Oh Lord you preferred the others over me well we deserve what we get God God gotta trust us with this one God knows but he can trust you with amen brother God knows what he can trust us with oh brother I've prayed the Holy Spirit to to expand it and multiply it there what was said tonight in your heart and soul and that it will humble us a man so that we are the sons and daughters of God humblest Lord to Abel I don't know if I would want that to you as I preached years ago white church would you rather be in Cannes or Abel's Abel's was bloody a mess Cannes were beautiful white church was you've been where I'd rather be in my blessing would you rather have this one or that one god help us to say the will of the Lord not my will father dine be done Nestor crossroads Jesus came to that's the crossroads of bride has come to in the second crucifixion not my will father died and be done get ready get ready because God is gonna clear us down here to take us up there that's right so grace to us by that will receive the true reward by by the grace of God our brother mission Saints my brother Macondo sent me an email just last couple of days just on your report on religion around the world and that more and more people that say they believe in God do not believe in church they don't feel the necessity of going to church all they feel they say you should just believe God and go on and do what you want to do no no and I thought about it oh I said what about what about what the scripture says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and much more as you see the Day approaching much more who's going in the rapture I pray God make this word and this message real to us tonight the true reward by the grace of God into our hearts and souls and God bless you and regarding Easter we don't need Easter remind us of what Jesus did Jesus said in the church the emblems of his shed blood and broken body he said do this in remembrance of me he didn't say keep Easter in remembrance of me he said do this that's why the Father God said if you don't take the communion of foot washing he said you got no part with him amen so there got serious that's serious I believe Abel took it that serious and he was willing to make that sacrifice I believe job took her that serious in and in all that situation brother losing ten children to one time he didn't say nothing about God he didn't blame God he just he said God God is just and so on god help us brother and our brother brought out it but Paul and all that Paul and went through and when he went ask God about it what did God tell him he said Lord this this and this God said Paul my grace is sufficient for you god help us this is serious I pray that that the reward is more more real to us than what God asked us to do amen what we're going to get it's going to be more real than what we do it again because Jesus has paid the price a man thank God for Calvary thank God for the finished work of Calvary that's what it's kept them all down through the ages and that's what has kept us and that's what's taking us back to glory amen let's sing god bless you be in prayer for the service tomorrow night and God bless our brother Brandon again tomorrow night listening I remember Calvary by the grace of God where he may lead me I will go for I have learned to trust him soul trust him is able trust him as David trust him as job and and as Paul and I remember twice for me it was for you it was for me that he was slain on Calvary Jesus shall lead me not me lead Jesus Jesus leading me to the great reward the true reward Jesus shall lead me night and day Jesus shall lead me all the way is
