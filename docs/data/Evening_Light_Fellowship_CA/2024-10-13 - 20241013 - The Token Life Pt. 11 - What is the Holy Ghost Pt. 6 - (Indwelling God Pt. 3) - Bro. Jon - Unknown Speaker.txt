desire Lord is that we could live a pure and clean life before you Lord may you turn that desire into a reality we pray Lord bless your people now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you wonderful song service this morning amen God bless you turn our scriptures if you would to Ephesians chapter 4 amen just a few announcements of course I'm traveling to Pi for work this week so brother Mark will take the Wednesday night service while I'm gone amen want to welcome brother Chad sister Leah back amen God bless you good to see you and then we have brother iel that's leaving us Thursday I believe for 5 weeks something like that I I almost wonder if we've done something for somebody to leave us for so long of their own free will but we know he's got to go back for a a wedding not his wedding but a wedding amen and uh so we pray the Lord to be with you brother Vel that he will guard and keep you that he will make you a witness a continuing witness amen as you're gone amen and uh I do want to thank brother Grant also this morning you know last service I said I've been using a a study from Brother Jason dears on this preaching but I was just about done this on yesterday and I remember that brother Grant had spoken to me about some of these things and shared some of those things and I went back and kind of fact checked myself and even made some changes so brother Grant thank you for that we're our body amen I never claimed to know it all to understand it all and there's many uh men that have gone before me to study the things we're going to talk about this morning and here's one thing I know I don't want to waste my time trying to figure it out when somebody's done the hard work so I'll use their work every time if I can and you know there may be things in here that maybe go beyond and and maybe some things that don't go quite as far in certain areas but I'm thankful for that so brother Grant God bless you for your service in this as well amen uh we want to remember Sister Melody as well she's getting close to her time of Deliverance amen and so that baby's due pretty quickly so we want to remember her brother Kingsley he's a business owner so he has a lot going on day by day and then you have a wife that's pregnant for the first time and about to deliver a baby for the first time and for those of you that remember the first one it's always usually the most nerve-wracking because you don't know what to expect so we want to remember her and brother Kingsley in particular in the coming days and weeks until the baby comes amen God bless you Ephesians chapter 4 we we read this scripture last service it says there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and we've been talking about what is the Holy Ghost and we're talking about the the idea of an indwelling God and we're looking at what the Holy Ghost has been and what it is in our lives and we know that it's God dwelling within us but we had to take a step back and like I said last service I I I thought we could maybe skip godhead for a while but I just had to go through it and so that's what we've been preaching on his his godhead and and and and what does God look like and how does he reveal himself and so last service we went through the attributes of God how that God's a spirit and that he he exists outside of this dimension of time and space and matter he can step into it but he's not bound by the laws of nature the way that we are amen he's outside of all these things he can enter in and he can interact with us here but he's not bound by the things that we are and in the Book of Psalms David would say this he said before the mountains were brought forth orever thou Hast formed the earth and the world even from Everlasting to Everlasting Thou Art God Amen from before it started there was an everlasting before and we can't even understand that idea that there was no time before there was time but even before that he was God and afterwards when it's all said and done and we go into eternity it's God it's God from start to finish there is no second God there is no third God there is no second person there is no third person it is God and God Alone it was it is the one true God and all of this and and I I will never pretend to understand God Amen we can't understand the greatness the we can't understand something that is not someone that is not created that doesn't have a beginning that doesn't have an end we just can't grasp those things but God is Jehovah his name is Jehovah and it means the self-existing one it means he's not dependent on something he isn't relying on something he's Unlimited in power he's Unlimited in strength he's Unlimited in in glory and the wonderful thing about that is that he does not change over time he does not change and so I say that to say this what we read about in here is who he is today and what he did then he can do today amen there is no limit on him so often oh I I I was just watching something that yesterday for a bit and and it it was a group of ministers sitting on a on a platform saying and they're preaching this doctrine of cessation that basically God only worked the way he did in the book of acts and he's never going to do it again and they completely ignore everything that happened after that including today including today why because they have put God in a box of their own doctrine of their own denomination and guess what because they don't believe it he can't do it he can't do it in their midst because there's no faith there remember the scripture says that Jesus went to capern or Galilee in these different areas it says he could do no great works there because of their unbelief and so he did a little miracle here and a little miracle there not because of their unbelief but because he found somebody with a little bit of Faith amen that's the only way he could do it amen but we can bind God by our unbelief amen so we don't ever want to put God in a box amen he's the unfolding God that's really where we ended last servic is he's the unfolding God he's revealing himself more and more and more and we're receiving a revelation in this age that has never been seen before except in part in the book of Acts because they fell away from it and now we're coming back into it amen but I'm getting ahead of myself already God help me amen but but we read last service how that first creation of God was light amen and and and it was Genesis uh chapter 1 verses or or chapter 1 veres 2 and 3 and it wasn't the sun and the moon and the stars because that was created on the fourth day but on the first day God created light amen and that light was the first born it was the first creation it was the word of God and we're we're showing that because we want to understand how God moves and works in this Dimension and he does it by the word me that's the way that he works inside of this God could have just worked everything by his great Holy Spirit he could have just done it as a spirit form outside of all of these different things he could have done it in a in a way that we couldn't see or feel or understand but he chose to come down now in a way that we could interact and he did it in a body of light and we talked about how that was that Perfect Light it's that pure light and the scripture says there's no shadow in him there's no variableness there's nothing that is not light inside of God because that is the attribute of God is that he's pure he is clean throughout there is no changing parts within him amen and then what happened God stepped into that light it was created and then he stepped into it amen he didn't create another being he didn't create another mind he didn't create another person rather God stepped into that light and that light became the dwelling place of God Amen that's the way it was we would say it was God above us some people would say it was God the Father brother Bram says God the Father sometimes and sometimes he says God the son because it's a creat being amen the father is not the created being he's the one from which things come so brother Braham generally says that is God the that is the sun being created and we'll see that as we go through here we can call it whatever title we want the title does not matter the point that matters is that God stepped into it amen and it wasn't another God it wasn't another person God stepped into it amen and really what we see that Pillar of Fire was is that is Christ that is the word that's who Christ is Christ is not a man Christ is the word that's the way we understand it and that's where the Trinity I think struggles so often is that they try and turn this into persons rather than the idea of the word being placed in vessel after vessel and it's just the revealing it's the unfolding of God as he goes through amen Christ is just the anointed one what it's the body Anointed with the very presence of God himself that's what the word is amen so why would we call this light the son why would we call it that because the son comes from the father amen that's the Christ it's the son is produced by the father he's a creation of the father and so all God did was he took the the attributes of himself he spoke it and it became reality and then he stepped into that himself the very person of God Amen so when we come to God we have to realize that the body he takes on is not something that we would necessarily call a body we look at bodies as the bodies that we have human bodies and those sorts of things it doesn't have to be a person but it can be a person God can step into a body that looks like a person and we'll talk about that in the service today but God can step into a body of light God can step into a body of wind God can step into a body of fire god can step into a body of cloud and it is still the person of God Amen it's still the person of God that's that's the way it is whatever God chooses whatever God creates whatever God purposes as soon as God steps into it that body is the dwelling place of God Amen it's not a second person it's not a second God or a third God or whatever you want to call it it's just God stepping into a body of his own choosing and making God is a Creator he can literally create a body like that and we'll talk about that a little bit as we go here he can create it and he can step into it and then he can step away from it and that thing can dis and he just he speaks it into existence he can speak it right out of existence it was there one minute and it's gone the next it wasn't there one minute and then it was there the minute God can step in and out of this Dimension any way he wants and reveal himself and we call this Pro process in morphe it's a it's a Greek phrase this transformation when God steps into a body and he wraps himself in something or he appears to be something then it's a Greek phrase called inor and it's God putting on a mask is the way brother BR would say it I like to go a little further I say it's God putting on a costume it's a full thing because the mask only hides this but a costume is the whole thing amen and God steps in and and you you re you say could that be God why because you can't see anything except this this entire thing that wraps around him amen amen it's not immediately obvious who he is by Vision he doesn't always here as a as a great Angel as a Shining Light sometimes it's a person you're talking to did you know you could talk to God and not realize it there's people in the in the Bible that did it they didn't realize who they were talking to at first but then they realized by Revelation why because the word reveals the word so how do we recognize God we recognize him by the word amen We compare what we're seeing and what we're hearing to what the word says and if it matches with the word then it must be the word whether it's a whether it's uh you know it's not normal whether it's something we hadn't considered something we hadn't thought possible when Christ came he was way too far outside of what they were expecting but if they would have compared him to the written word they would have found out he was the living word amen so I don't care how Supernatural something is I don't care if it makes us feel warm and fuzzy I don't care if it makes the hairs on our on our arms stand up I don't care how many goose pimples it gives us if it doesn't match the word of God or more to the point if it contradicts F the word of God it is not God I'm not saying it's not Supernatural because there are other Supernatural forces amen there's two kingdoms at War here there's a kingdom of Satan and there's a kingdom of God and the scripture says that Satan and his his his his demons are often revealed as angels of light the way they come is 99.9% light but there's a shadow there there's a variable there's a shadow of turning there's that variableness that you don't find in the word of God and so you can say you might be Supernatural but you are not of my kingdom and you can rebuke that thing and that's why I said you know when we talk about we get inspiration as as ministers and we go back to the word and we find it isn't 100% that's why we throw it all away we don't try and Salvage it because Satan is 99% light so many times but that one bit of darkness is what separates him from Christ the word amen our only discernment that we have church is this by the holy spirit it's the only discernment we have we we go by feelings we go by events we go by the supernatural that is not what determines whether it's the word of God whether it's God it's what matches up to the word of God Amen we test things by their fruit not by how they make us feel so often I think as message Believers we can come to the place where we're resting on what we've there's an intuition there you got to check that you got to check that because we are still in an unredeemed body and that intuition can absolutely be the flesh amen it doesn't have to necessarily be the Holy Spirit I believe as we grow and mature in Christ then often what happens is we'll get something that says wo and I believe that's the Holy Spirit not always but often it is and we learn to check that we learn to take it back to the word amen but God created this light and we walk through some of the scriptures showing that God is light that's his original creation his original attribute and and we saw that in in Genesis 13 it says that God separated the light from the darkness and the Darkness couldn't overcome it now we think of that as the natural way that light is but that is an attribute that God built into light that light and darkness could not be in the same place at the same time amen and the nature of light is that it reveals things and in Ephesians the next chapter from where we read it says but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever does make manifest is light right sister Moren this is one of her favorite scriptures I'd never remembered it until she told me about it when I moved here and it's become a favorite of mine because in other words when something is revealed Darkness has to go away and as children of God we run to this rather than away from it you want to know if somebody's a real believer when the word exposes something that needs to be reproved what do we do church we come right up here and we say Lord Jesus that's me that's me and we humble ourselves to the word because what we are children of light we are children of God remember the scripture says if we walk in the light we choose to walk in it he gives it we choose to step into it amen if we walk in the light as he is in the light you can't walk with Christ the word unless you're in the light of the word amen if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another cuz what you got to walk there and I've got to walk there we can't have fellowship if you're in darkness and I'm in light he says then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin amen that's the only way that it can work amen is that we walk in the light and we sometimes have to fight this flesh this flesh does not like to be reproved this flesh does not need to like to be revealed what its true nature is amen and so when those things pop up then what do we do we run to the light and we say God take it away your word has revealed it for a purpose and the purpose is not to shame me it's not to make me embarrassed it's to take the shackles off my life so that I can walk in newness of life in the freedom of the Holy Spirit by the word of God Amen that's why it's doing it inside of our Lives now I want to start where I ended last service how that God is the unfolding God and I said earlier that we've never had the the full revelation of God until this age because God's been doing a work and he did an Old Testament work amen of revealing himself and then he came and he lived in Christ in a man for 33 and A2 years and then after that he came and he had a third revealing of himself and that's in a people amen and that's in the the bride of Christ that's in the true church and God is moving and God was moving from Christ into a new light and that's where we read that scripture in the in the first uh service on this where he said ye are the he said I am the light of the world but then he comes he says ye are the light of the world what is it it's a further revealing of God and it's going to be in you and I but we're going to get to that way way further down in this series by God's grace amen but what am I trying to say I'm saying never limit the revealing of God God can reveal himself in any way he wants as long as he doesn't contradict this word it can be outside of the word but it cannot contradict the word amen God bound himself we say don't put God in a box but God absolutely put himself in a box with this word and he says I can't go against it why because it's him he is the word it came from him it's his very attributes and thoughts on these different things amen so we want to talk about this notion of God revealing himself by the word and remember we said last service you cannot answer Trinity do with Trinity labels it doesn't work because you'll keep trying to do you'll keep trying to find an explanation for something that you need not explain the way that they believe it remember we said that they call him God the son but you'll never find the phrase God the son in the scriptures we will find Son of God but we do not find God the son that's never there amen and there's a huge difference that is in those two phrases and we'll see that probably next service Lord willing when we start to talk about Jesus Christ the man but we ask what is a son and we say said the son is the expressed image or attributes of his father amen he's the DNA of his father he's the creation of his father and that's the simplest way to understand who the son is who the Son of God is it is the attributes it's the creation it's the visible portion of God the Son of God is the expressed and created attributes of God himself amen and we call all those things the word it's the literal the living the visible interpretation and attributes of God in this Dimension so all that God is is in the Son of God the nature the attributes when we get to Christ the man we'll see his literal DNA was God's DNA if there was such a thing amen but it's just God stepping into our reality it's God stepping into space and time and matter and interacting with us and the world around us it's not a second personality it's not a second mindset it's not a second attitude it's just God putting himself into a body that we can sort of see and understand with our limited understanding amen and the first body God wrapped himself in was light and we call that the pillar of fire amen as we said in the beginning the Genesis 1:2 says and God said let there be light and there was light and that was not the Sun the moon and the stars that's down in Genesis 1:14 in the fourth day rather God created a light and he stepped into this light amen and this was the first expression of the word of God Amen this is the first expression of the son of God and what was it it was God putting himself in the body it's the person of God stepping into the body of God I mean does that make sense the person of God the the the literal God stepping into a body that he prepared for himself but we'll see even later as we go into this service that even within that shell if we want to call it that body of light the literal theophany of God is dwelling inside of that amen the literal shape the form of God the celestial body of God is with in that light and we know that it's in the shape of a man because why we are in the image of God we are not created in an image of light we are created in an image of a body and so God has to have a body as well that's in we are in the image we are not perfect but it is going to look like our body amen we'll see it as we go by the scriptures but God steps into that body remember what we said the word was the word is the logos it's the thoughts of God that were spoken and then became reality amen the thoughts of God are powerful but they are powerful when they are spoken not just when they're thought it has to speak that's why we have to be a speaking bride not just a hearing bride is because when we speak it it puts it into action amen but it has to be the mind of Christ that puts it into action because it's then in his time and in his season as we do those things amen so God steps into this and what does he do remember we read read in Colossians 1 that everything was created through this being through the word amen it was it was the the first uh example that we have of Christ the anointed one amen and God continued his creation and he continued to speak the word and he said let there be and there was and every time he said it it was good what it it was an exact representation of what he had thought amen and so everything we see here is God working through this now the idea we have that that the Son of God is Jesus Christ the man is I think the hardest thing for people to understand because Christ is the anointed one he is not a man that lived 2,000 years ago remember Jesus said and we'll get into this next service Lord willing he says before Abraham was I am Jesus said that Jesus said that not that body there's something else that was I am in Christ that was the I am that he was talking about amen so we cannot say that je that Christ is the only is the man that was 2,000 years ago Christ is way before that Colossians 1 tells us that amen it's the Son of God it's the it is the the the visible God being revealed to us amen Jesus said I come from my father and I go back to my father and the next time we see Jesus is where he's on the road to Damascus having knocked Saul off of his high horse and Saul says Lord Jehovah who are you and who does he say I am I am Jesus what was he he started as light and he went back to light it's Christ the word it is not just a man hallelujah how do you fit that into Trinity Doctrine when he walked in flesh and then literally a couple of years later he is the literal Pillar of Fire identifying himself by name I am Jesus who you're persecuting so he's saying I'm Jesus this light is Jesus and he says oh by the way you're persecuting me and he's persecuting Believers God above us and God in us simultaneously how does that work you can't pull that through Trinity Doctrine it doesn't work amen but he starts here as a great light now listen to this it says now that was the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel was the Lord Jesus Christ he doesn't say Jesus Christ he says Lord Jesus Christ form the logos that went out of God Amen look don't don't when we come to this idea of the Son of God or Jesus Christ don't look for aen look for where the word is amen look for the expression of God don't attach Lord Jesus Christ just to the body of a man 2,000 years ago that walked on Earth that's a part of it but it's not all of it amen that's a revelation of God but it's not the full revealing the full revealing of God is Lord Jesus Christ when he walk this Earth he was not Lord he says you call me Lord and you say well for so I am but he was not revealing himself as Lord there he was completely subject to the father there but he's going to come later and it's in a different thing it is king of kings and Lord of lords that's the final Revelation that the world is going to see of him will be as judge and King amen but we see that Lord Jesus Christ is the full revelation of God not just the man that was here 2,000 years ago then he would say this he says the great Fountain brother Bob that was a wonderful song service this morning the great Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty he says that Spirit of tress in this Perfection and then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son he says which was a theophany now what's a theophany says which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body he says that's the logos the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word amen we'll get into what a theophany is a little bit later in more detail but the simple definition of a theophany is that it's a Heavenly Body it's a Celestial body amen it's a supernatural body that's intended for everyone that is of the family of God to dwell in God has one you have one and I have one Jesus said I go to my father's house what to prepare he says there's many mansions there those are the theophany bodies of the children of God that are waiting for them amen that's what's waiting for us beyond the curtain of time and it joins our flesh body with our theophany body to create a glorified body amen not this flesh body as it is it'll be the redeemed flesh body that's the full day of our Redemption amen is when this body is changed into sinless Perfection unites with our theophany but I want to go back to what we read in John chapter 1 last service and and kind of just we're building from where we started last time and a few people weren't here and so I wanted to just take a bit of time this morning to go through it it's a Sunday morning I'm not going to rush I'm just going to try and take my time by God's grace he says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God it says all things were made by him who the word and without him was not anything made that was made by who the word of God who is the word of God it's Christ Christ the word amen we read that in Colossians 1 last service Christ's identification is always the word and we see that the word means the expression of God Amen it's the anointed one the manifestation the expression the reality the visible God it says in him was life and the life was the light of man you know we have the word for for for God in the Old Testament is Jehovah and then we have it and we say it's Yahweh but but the actual word written out in English is YH wh and you cannot pronounce it it's not a word but the way they say that you pronounce it is you take a breath in and you put a breath out so this y HWH is that's how you pronounce the name of God and it says here he is the life and that life was the light of man literally our every breath expresses God you can't walk a day without expressing God every breath you make expresses the name of God as he revealed it in his original word amen but watch this Gap now it said and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not okay that's the word the word the word the word the word is in light now we have this Gap this was all before the man Jesus Christ ever came on this Earth amen Christ was there before the literal body of Jesus came amen 4,000 years later because in verse 14 it says and the Word was what first it was made light now it says the word was made flesh that's Jes Jesus Christ the man and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now we showed this in the slides last time and we said that God is a spirit he's not bound by this world and so he's kind of the the white line all the way around that's God outside of everything amen and God is a spirit he's invisible he's shapeless he's boundless he's Eternal and all of the the attributes of God are inside of him but then he had this idea of the thoughts that would relate to his bride to his family and he put those all together and we call that the word of God and it's the thoughts and attributes it's the plans it's the children of God it's the lamb slain before the foundation of the world it's the whole Plan of Redemption of the restoration of the production of the children of God and we take that whole thing and we call that the word and God wrote it down for us so we could see it so this is the word written it's not the word spoken it's the word written but before it was ever written it had to be thought and then it became spoken by God it became the spoken word the Loos now it does not leave God but rather it comes out of him God's still there it's still a part of God but the words come out and what do they produce they produce a light amen and in this in this light is where God would dwell and he would step into this light amen and that light is the word amen the word was meant to be more than the thoughts of God attributes are meant to be expressed thoughts are meant to be spoken and then they're meant to become something do we say words so that they can fall on deaf ears am I preaching this morning so that you won't change no I'm preaching so that you will change that you'll have a greater understanding you'll have a greater appreciation that you'll draw closer to God that you'll pull away from the things of the world the point of speaking words is that they would have have an effect and that comes from the very origin of Genesis that God had thoughts and he spoke them and the point was that the word was supposed to have an effect amen so we have this logos now we have this light and it is not all of God but it is completely God everything that's in it is God there is no nothing else that's in there amen there's no alternate opinions there's nothing of the satanic world or Kingdom there's there's no Shadows it's just God God God all the way through it's 100% God Amen amen and so God didn't create here a new Consciousness didn't create a new person God created a form and he stepped into that himself amen he put his own self into that body of light and he dwelt in there and through that body now he interacted with creation and actually brought creation into existence by the spoken word amen but what happens after this is God limited now is the word limited to a pillar of fire is that the only revealing of God is that the only revealing of Christ brother Grant's telling me no so I better be right I better be in agreement with them here right no that can't be the only way we see God we go through the scriptures and we see God revealed in so many different ways but it's always the same God really if we were to take the Trinity of Doctrine and apply it all through the scriptures we'd have to come up with about 19 different gods cuz if every time God steps into a body that becomes another part of the godhead then we'd have so many gods it wouldn't be funny but that's not the way it is it is one God revealing himself time and time again God in morphe God changing his costume his mask if we want to put it that way and we now we step out of Genesis 1 of The Creation story two where he puts Adam and Eve there now we go into Genesis 3 it says and they heard Adam and Eve heard the voice of the Lord God doing what walking in the Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden garden So Adam and Eve are now interacting with God this is Jehovah God this is God the Eternal spirit and he's doing what he is not he's not gliding through in a pillar of fire pillars of fire don't walk I don't know if you know that they don't walk they float they move what walks Church bodies bodies walk people walk so God is now in a body walking throughout the Garden of Eden amen and so God God comes down in an image that matches the image that he created and he steps into a body and that body is not God God just creates a body and he steps into it amen but you can worship it as God because God's in there amen so I imagine that God came down and I would imagine he's in what we would call a glorified body it appears as flesh it looks as flesh you can touch it you can do all these things but it is Ageless it has nothing it's perfect it's a perfectly created body but who is walking there it's the word in a body it was in a body of light now it's in a body of Flesh it's the created body of God indwelt by God having a conversation with his children and he's interacting now with creation it's God and a body all over again and who is it church it's Christ it's Christ the word not the flesh man Jesus but it's Christ the word which is the revealing of God walking with and talking with his children we have to understand to understand God have we have to understand the purpose of the word and the purpose of the word is to reveal and produce God that's its only purpose and when you find yourself in it it's there to produce your portion of God that's really what's happening in all the these things is to produce to manifest the thoughts the attributes the nature the Judgment the plan the purpose of God in this Dimension so we cannot look at the word as a separate individual from God because it's not it's just God himself revealing himself inside of this Dimension that we're in God comes to us God is with us and God is in us and it's the same God all the way through but we see here in Genesis 3 that God is walking in a body with his children and interacting with them he can hand them skins amen he can talk he can turn the serpent can see and interact with him amen but then we jump a little further and this is where we'll spend the majority of the service with Abram because God is trying to produce the word in Abraham and what happens to produce the word the word has to come to you that's the way that it works amen the word has to come to you to produce the word inside of you that's why we have to sit under the true preaching of the word because because it's only the true word will produce the true word but God comes forward now and we have Abram coming and he's he's gone and he's rescued lot and he's taken his 300 plus servants out and he's slaughtered the Kings out there and he's come back and he meets a man on the plains there and he has an experience with this man he's a king he's a priest and we see here a great Revelation in the scriptures and in Genesis 14 it says and mzc the king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine the word and revelation of the word and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which had delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all Abraham gave this priest this King tithe there was no law there was no requirement of ties at that time Church why did Abraham do do it Abraham did it by Revelation knowing who that was that he owed something to that man to that person that he was talking to and he gave it and not only that but God by Revelation through Abraham was making the way for an ironic priesthood that would come later that would owe God nothing Abraham paid the way for Levi scripture says Levi paid ties in the loins of Abraham God attributed those ties he didn't requ of Abraham he was taking those tithes for the sake of Levi and they would give their lives as a tithe they were the tithe Hallelujah they were the tithe of God out of the children of Israel he says I'm not going to take a little bit from every tribe I'm going to take one complete tribe and they will serve me and they'll be my priests and they're the only ones that can do it Abraham was Paving the way for people to serve God in a special way amen but we see that Abraham recognized who this man was but we see here it's just he's the king of Salem and he was the priest of the most high God that doesn't make a whole lot of sense why Abraham would do this but now we come to Paul in Hebrews 7 and Paul starts to tell us who this mzc was he says and from this mzc for this mzc rather king of Saum priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all then it says it starts Paul starting to tell us who this mesc is he says first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of Peace church there's only one king of righteousness and there's only one king of peace and it is not an Earthly King amen he says now listen these are the attributes of melchisedek see if you can catch who this is without father without mother without dissent he doesn't have a mommy he doesn't have a dad he doesn't have a family lineage he doesn't have a family history he doesn't have a family genealogy can't where he come from and can't tell where he's going he says neither having beginning of days nor end of life he never started and he never ends he says made but made like unto the Son of God oh so he is like the Son of God he's not the Son of God but he's like the Son of God he's like Christ but he's not Christ himself the Jesus we understand is what he's talking about he says he abideth a priest continually he's a priest forever is what he's saying he's not the Son of God but he's like unto the Son of God so this isn't Jesus here is what he's saying this isn't Jesus the man he says now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils Paul says really think about it who was this man that Abraham gave all this money to his description in Genesis makes him sound yes like a great man a great king but when Paul comes and he starts to reveal the attributes of them he's more than a great man he's more than a great priest he has the very attributes of God himself amen the king of Peace the king of righteousness without a starting of days without an ending of days amen that's more than any priest or Minister I've ever met church as great as the ones we've met they don't compare to this consider this he has no parents he has no family lineage no known relatives nobody knows where comes from amen he's a priest forever he's more than Aaron ever was before Aaron was I am amen he's a great priest amen that priest wasn't even in existence at that point but watch what brother Ram says now he says the logos we want to see the origin of this that logos the great Fountain this great Fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end he says this great spirit begin to form in the cre and the logos that went out from it was the son of God it was the only visible form that the spirit had he says and it was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man Moses saw it when it passed by the Rock and when he looked at it he said it looked like the him part of a man it's the same type of body that we receive when we die here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting he says that was it that was the theophany which which was which was the son of God so he says that great fountain that Spirit it had no beginning nor end it has a theophany body it has a Celestial body it looks like a man he says Moses saw it so let's go to the scriptures and see what happened here because Moses said that that God says I'm going to show you the hinder part the hind part of a man the back of a man and then we'll come back to mzc to see who this man was but in Exodus 33 it says and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing that thou Hast spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name and Moses said he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said God said I will make what all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and they and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou cannot see my face for there shall be no man see me and live God says under this dispensation under this revealing of me you can't see me face to face but I'll show you my goodness and that'll have to suffice Moses and the Lord said behold there's a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come when my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen so I want to point out two things here the goodness of God is a body it's a body amen which is what the word made real the goodness of God is the word coming into reality in your life amen so God says to Moses he says Moses there's a rock here and I'm just going to move this maybe set it up a little bit and so God says Moses there's a rock here and I want you to step on the Rock he says but as I come close to you he says I'm you want to step into the Cliff of the rock imagine this rock is high like this he says so you can't see me coming and as I come by you Moses I'm going to put my hand here so that you can't see my face but as I Cross by you I'll lower my hand and you'll see the back of me and he says what you will see is the back part of what church a man amen I'll let you see my goodness the goodness of God is the revealing of himself in a body amen and so he walks by and Moses sees the backside of a man what is it Moses was speaking with what church a pillar of fire remember brother said he said they got the light perfect when they did it in the in the in the Ten Commandments and it's the whirling fire of God it's the pillar of God it's the logos it's the body of God but within that is the literal theophonic is standing there to see the goodness of God and he walks by in his natural shape and form in which we are created hallelujah what an experience Church Moses comes down from that mountain having seen only the back of God and the glory of God was on his entire ire body so that his face Shone like God himself if that's what you can get from being in the presence of God and only seeing the back of him what ought we to have this morning when we can see him face to face Hallelujah that Moses would have to wear a veil over his face because he had been in the presence of God a sinful man under the blood of bulls and goats and yet the transference of that Glory could come on to Moses just by being in his presence church if people could see God in Moses then what out they to see in us today amen cuz we read this earlier Moses could not see his face he could see his goodness but he couldn't see his face but watch what John said in John 1:14 he said the word sorry one quote brother Bram says God isn't without a body God has got a body and it looks like a man Moses saw it others saw it and it looks like a man that's the theophany body of God it's in the shape of a man it's not flesh like we understand it but it is a theophus Celestial body Moses said God show me your glory and God said I'll only let you see a portion of it but it's in the body of the word but now John comes along and he says what the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld what his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of what church Grace and Truth we get to see him face to face amen we get to see him in the light of his full Glory why because we're under a New Covenant it's a Grace Covenant but it's a Grace Covenant with the spirit of truth that's bringing us all the way back to the word in the beginning anden that's where we're sitting this morning amen hallelujah God has a body and that body is a special body it's not like ours it was light and it was fire in the beginning but God has a theophany a a in the shape of a man and he dwells in it amen and we're in that image that's why we look the way we do and we're made in a particular form and it's a reflection of the form of God's body himself brother Brown goes to explain what a theophany is and this is not a message Doctrine this is scriptural this is the way it's always been understood I don't think anyone disagrees with this he says the logos that went out of God a better word for it was what we call a theophany he says a theophyl US make man in our image and what did he produce Adam in a spirit form Adam was in a theophany body that's what could happen without sin he could go straight into his theophany and then what happened is God created a body from the dust of the earth and then that theophany body joined with this Natural Body and It produced literally a glorified body Adam was living in a glorified body it's what we'll have when we are living here on the Earth again it's our theophany joined with perfect flesh amen and that produces a glorified body amen he says a theophany is a human body that's glorified it says not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in its glorified stage see he's saying in when we come into and we pass into eternity or even into the Millennium we can eat and we can we can uh uh digest things and we can sleep and do all these different things in theory not sorry not sleep we can eat that's the point is we can we can interact with it he says it's in the form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but it's a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one that's the kind of body that God was for he said let us make man in our own image and in our likeness so theophany doesn't need to eat it doesn't need to sleep it doesn't need to drink it exists it's in a spiritual form it's a Celestial form if we want to do that amen it's perfect in its form it looks like a physical body but it is not a physical body it can't touch two theophanies coming together they don't touch they're spirit it's a spirit body amen but I want us to come back to mchis because we'll come into this theophany as we move forward in this because we want to compare his attributes to those of God and we start to see this beautiful picture emerge brother Bram says notice this melchisedek as soon as he met Abraham coming from the slaughter of the Kings he says the mystery of God is now being made known Oh I thought he was just a king and a priest no no no this is the revealing of God who was he they can't find any history of him because he didn't have any father he didn't have any mother he never had any time he began he never had any time he'd ever die so whoever he was is still alive he says he never did have a beginning so he couldn't have been nobody else but El Elohim the self-existent self abiding almighty God he says now that we find out that this person had no father no mother no beginning of days nor ending of life he said it was God and here we have that Greek phrase I was talking about inor now that Greek word means to change was used changing himself in morphy from one person to another person it's not multiple persons it's the changing of God and how he is seen and revealed because we'll see that mzc there's a changing of the revealing of God and it will be Christ Jesus Christ on this Earth amen but there's a natural priest back then and it's God IM morphe God dwelling in a body he says imorph means that he changed himself he came down see he was light he was Pillar of Fire pillar of light he came down he says now the Greek word there means that something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye can catch it so when God makes himself in morphe it's so we can see so we can understand so we can interact so that we can recognize what's going on he says that Greek word there and morphe was taken from the stage act that one person one person is changing his mask to make him some other character he says like in school they have one of Shakespeare's plays and one young man had to change his clothes several times that's why I say costume not just mask cuz if he wore the same clothes and just changed his mask you know who he was but you have to change the whole thing he says that one young man had to change his clothes several times because he played two or three different parts but the same person he came out one time he was the villain when he come out the next time he was another character he says now the Greek word imorph means that he changed his mask he says that's what God did it's the same God all the time the same God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in morphe brought out so that he could be sing right that's God in human flesh in Jesus Christ he says and now the same God is the Holy Ghost he says father son Holy Ghost not three Gods three offices three acts of the one God it's the unfolding of God the revealing of God he says God and Morp masked in the pillar of fire god and morphe in a man called Jesus and then he says God and morphe in his church God above us God With Us God in us and then he says the condescending of God hallelujah amen watch how we see God being revealed here God above us the pillar of fire and we'll see that God does not always remain above us in that Pillar of Fire but that is where he naturally stays now he can come down and talk to us but then he goes back up again we can't bring him to us he has to choose to come to us we can't go to him he has to come to us every single time amen God above us in the pillar of fire amen his body of light and fire he's there he's visible but he's not really obtainable to us amen then we have God With Us by the way of the man Jesus Christ and it's God With Us it's not God the son it is God dwelling in a body of Flesh amen God through that Son of God that Crea body we could see him we could feel him we could hear him we could smell him we could we could we could go bug him if we wanted and then we could find him he was accessible we could come to him easily in our flesh if we lived in that day access was not hidden from the people when it came to Jesus everyone could come and talk to him everyone could come here and preach everyone could see him touch him talk with him have him talk back God With Us amen what is it God is moving closer and closer to his full purpose now he's moving closer and closer to the full revealing of himself through his word and what is that revealing it's that we would be a family that we would be in the perfect image of God that we'd have perfect relationship perfect fellowship with him that we would be of the same nature and the same form as the word that's all he's trying to do is get us back to what the word says we are amen and so we have God above us God With Us but then he says now we've got the Holy Spirit and it's God indwelling us it's God in us and that is the greatest condescension of all because now he's living in an imperfect form that God in his Holiness in his greatness in his power and in his majesty could Dain to come down to condescend and dwell in you and I is the greatest Revelation that you will ever have of this word is that is Christ in you the hope of glory amen God could come to Fallen humanity and under the blood of Jesus Christ and by the washing of the water of the word he can clean us up in our soul so that we could be a place a Dwelling Place of God know ye not that ye are the temple of God the holy spirit amen now we don't have to go to him see he was above us and we couldn't go to him then he was in Christ on this Earth and we could go to him but we couldn't be with him all the time now he's in us we don't have to go anywhere church we don't have to go anywhere he's with us all the time we don't have to seek him he's already sought us and he's found us us and he's living in us I don't have to come to church to get in the presence of God the presence of God is indwelling my life right now and when I walk out those doors it does not change his indwelling presence and that means it doesn't change his power doesn't change his sovereignty doesn't change his Holiness doesn't change his effect when I go out of church I ought to live the same life I live in here amen he's with us always brother says now we're getting where mzc is he says that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and then the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us he says hold that there now notice his first being was Spirit God Supernatural I'll write the great Eternal he says second he began to form himself towards flesh he didn't say he was flesh he formed himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body it's towards flesh it's not flesh it's God the great spirit in that theophany body now taking on a form his b a body for himself that can dwell in flesh it's not flesh it can be in flesh amen so God creates a body of Flesh and then his theophany can join into that and now God can come down in humanity amen man that's the same thing that happened to Adam Adam was created in a theophany form in the image of God the image of God is Not That spirit that great spirit it's the image it's a visible shape it's a form so Adam was a theophany body a Celestial form like God and then God took the dirt of the Dust of the earth and he formed a flesh body and he threw put that spirit and he joined Adam to a fleshly perfect body and that was what life life on this Earth that's the perfect Son of God right there so if that's what Adam was then how could Christ be any different Adam was identified as the Son of God you go in the genealogies it says you know Seth was the son of Adam who was the son of God So Adam was a theophany placed into a natural body Christ is the second Adam what is he is the theophany of God in a natural body it's simple it's so simple amen he says this then is the state he was in when he met Abraham was called melkisedek he was in the form of a theophany he was the word it was a body there that God had created we'll touch on in a second he says he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed he says as he imorph himself into his servants and proves himself oh my goodness servants not just bodies now he's talking about people God can come down and dwell in people and reveal himself the same way he did through mzc and the same way he did through Christ he says you know here he is in the form of a spirit he's brother Ram's drawing some different things out he says in the pillar of fire then he comes in the form of a morphe in a body now he appeared to Abraham IM morphe when Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the Kings here comes melkisedek and talk to him he says now the difference between you and him and you as a son he's saying here's the difference between God and you as a child of God he says see he was at the beginning the word an in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person of melkisedek then later we never hear any more of mzc because he who Christ Living in him God living in him became Jesus Christ it's not that that body became Jesus Christ it was the revealing of God went from mzc a priest into Christ the priest that could mediate for us amen he says mzc was the priest but he became Jesus Christ in other words mzc was the theophany of God the body of God now expressed in flesh but that was in a perfect body it was in a created body amen that mzc was not born the way that Christ was born he was not born of a woman amen but he was spoken into existence by God God dwelt in it whereas Christ was born of a woman no DNA of her in him but born through the birth process that we have amen he grew up as a child amen but mzc was a spoken word body for God to dwell in amen he says now you bypass that because of sin you couldn't go theophany into here because your coming into a sinful body a theophany cannot be joined to a sinful body that's why it's waiting there it's waiting for this body to be redeemed cleared cleaned and then it gets joined and now we've got a glorified body so what we have is we have a spirit that gets joined to a physical body at the moment of birth that's all we have we skip our theophany we don't and he says he says because in that form he knew all things and you have never been able to know that yet why couldn't Adam be fooled church because he knew all things he was the word made flesh himself now Eve comes out of him and it's a portion right she doesn't know all things she doesn't know all things and it's just a representation of us we don't know all things we taken out she skipped the theophany cuz God separated Adam internally and he took out the feminine portion and he placed it in a woman but she didn't have that mindset before that Adam did Adam knew where he was before Adam had an understanding where he was that's why Christ could say before Abraham was I am because he could have a memory of it because it was God himself dwelling in him Adam had a representation before he ever came in this earth and it was in a theophonic body a theophany body amen but we couldn't do that we're meant to be born sinless imp Perfection and that would mean that we had a a recognition that we come from God and now we're here and it's God it's it's the nature of God that's dwelling in US amen we were meant to have that theop body joining to a perfect body and we would be living here in what we call glorified bodies Adam was living in a glorified body and the minute he sinned he lost it amen but because of sin we bypassed that and now we're in a Redemption process to take us back to those things and so when we're changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye as the scripture says our bodies are changed this fleshly body is now what redeemed amen it's cleaned up God just separates all the sin out of it amen and that's joined with our theophany body that Celestial body that's waiting and now we have a perfect glorified body and then what it is is the celestial the Heavenly joins with the Earthly and that's really the true Oneness that's a true revelation of Oneness is When Heaven and Earth come together in Perfection under without sin Amen brother R says and when the soul leaves the body it takes its journey into a place of rest into a body that's in the form and shape of this body but it isn't this type of body he says you'll meet your loved ones you couldn't shake their hands you could talk to them you could look at them they look just like they do here cuz when Peter and John and James saw Moses and Elijah they recognized them on Mount Transfiguration he says but it's a body he says and then when that body kind of a Celestial body when it returns back to the Earth it picks up the substance that it once lived in and then it becomes a glorified body and that body is the one that we'll see the Lord Jesus in his resurrected body he quotes the scripture does not appear what we shall be said Paul but we know that we shall have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he Isen so a perfect body is a glorified body is just the theophany joined with the redeemed perfected Earthly body and that's what makes it a glorified body it's Heaven and Earth joining amen it's the word coming to the word it's the soul joining with what everything else was there in the presence of God before this world ever began amen we're coming to a close talking about mzc he says now the true re of melkisedek comes into view what he says he was God the word before he became flesh so he was a theophany he combined that theophany into a flesh body of his own making spoke it into existence amen and interacted with Abram he says God the word cuz he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see I have father and mother you did too Jesus had father or mother but this man had no father or had no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't Jesus gave his life he says this man couldn't because he was life and it's the self-same man all the time he says I hope God reveals it to you the self-same person all the time so God reveals himself now to Abraham in the form of a king of a priest of a special man and now we jump forward in time with Abraham and God's dealing with him and God often spoke to Abraham in different ways and and by way of a dream or a voice and these different things and he might not see anything but then God would come to him in these bodies that look like flesh and that were flesh but we see that God's coming down now to confirm this Covenant with Abraham and God has Abraham s sacrificed the different animals and then what does God do to Abraham he puts him asleep because God's coming down to confirm his Covenant remember we saw his glory was Grace and Truth that's our covenant and with Abraham it's Grace God had to take Abraham completely out of the equation so Abraham goes to sleep and then there's a gross Darkness like in the original but out of the original we see this watch how God comes down cuz he's got to do it on his own he says it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces now God's revealing himself light and fire a consuming fire amen what is it it's the pillar of fire it's God and light passing through the sacrifices confirming his Covenant to Abraham what is it it's the word coming to Abraham and the word is passing through and saying this is my Testament this is my Covenant to you Abraham and when Abraham wakes up it's a finished work Hallelujah when Abraham WS up it's a finished work there's no stopping it there's no UND doing it amen but listen it's the Lord himself appearing to Abraham when you read this and just for the sake of time I'm not going to do it this morning but it says the Lord the Lord the Lord this is Jehovah God coming down and he's in the form of a pillar of fire and light again he was just in the form of a priest of a of Flesh and so God's just changing his form time and time again not a different God the same God time and time again and he's identified by his name then we jump forward just a few more chapters and we see God all over again and he's changed his appearance all over again and he's in a flesh body but it's not the same flesh body as MDC it says and the Lord the word there is Jehovah God himself the self-existing one and the Lord Jehovah appeared unto Abraham and the Plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three Gods stood by him no three men flesh he says and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground now notice it's three men there's no light here there's no fire here there's no wings creeping out from under their robes this is three men Flesh and Blood now we know that two of them are destroying Angels but the other one is God himself and it's not melkisedek it's the Lord in a completely different revealing and Abraham said my Lord if now I have I found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come at to your servant he says and they said so do as thou Hast said and Abraham hasted into the tent under Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the Hearth and Abraham ran into the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man excuse me and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat so they were flesh they could eat this is not just theophanes now this is not this is an actual flesh body they could eat could talk they could interact in every way we can you could touch them feel them it was God and angels IND dwelling flesh exactly like you and I and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I personal pronoun Jehovah God is the one that came down Jehovah God says I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman therefore Sarah laughed what out loud within herself this is an internal laugh like when one of my boys says he can beat me at arm wrestling what do I do I laugh internally Sarah laughed internally she did not say this out loud she didn't laugh out loud she didn't go she didn't bust out laughing she laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of shy bear a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I personal pronoun will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did laugh so there's a great mystery here God is revealing himself in flesh yet again completely different appearance how is God in another form how does this happen what is it that that makes it possible for God to step down and be completely unrecognizable in his form and yet it's God all over again says this he says then what happened he says this was God and the reason he had become from logos to flesh he says how do you he says what happened to that 5 minutes before that he was the logos it was God above us dwelling in a pillar of fire in a theophany he says but what did he do Church do not limit God he just reached over he says now our bodies are made out of 16 different elements of the world we know that it's made out of potach a little calcium petroleum Cosmic like atam so forth all bunded together it makes this body it comes from the the dust of the earth he says now and here this great theophany standing there that great Jehovah God you know what he said he just reached over and got a handful of atoms got a little light and poured it in like this and went a body and just stepped right into it that's all see I I love how he says that's all no big deal Hallelujah Church where are you at in your life this morning what struggles are you facing this morning that seemed completely impossible compare it to the creation of a body in a moment in the twinking of an eye and I say to you this morning he's a God that can do anything we have need of this morning Hallelujah he said he says and he just stepped right into it that's all said come here Gabriel that great Archangel went step in that come here Michael the angel has right side you step in that easy peasy lemon squeezy as the kids say no big deal Hallelujah no big deal he says God and two angels walked down here in human flesh and drank the milk from a cow ate the butter out of the milk and ate some cornbread and ate the Flesh of the calf two angels in God the Bible said so he says that's mzc it's not the flesh man mzc what is it it's the theophany in a body the theophany of God in a body he says that Abraham met coming from the slaughter of the Kings he says that's the Son of God he's not saying it's the same flesh he's just saying it's the same God dwelling in flesh amen because Abraham recognized him by Revelation not by sight and he compelled him to stay amen what was it it was the word of God dwelling in flesh how do we know the scripture says it the Lord Jehovah God Amen and it keeps repeating it but he keeps identifying himself by the word he says here's the word promise and I'm going to do it here's the word promise I'm going to do it oh you don't think it can be done guess what I'm going to do it I I I I I I'm completely out of the equation church amen what did the word do when it came as we close it discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart Sarah laughed and she doubted and the word said did you laugh why did you laugh why are you doubting it haven't you seen what I've done all along she said no I didn't laugh he says no you did laugh amen what is it the word does the word doesn't discern what is said Church the word discerns what is thought amen when the preaching of the word comes it's not what the pastor knows it's not what the preacher knows it's what the word of God knows amen it's not just words it's the living thoughts of God it's a revealer of the truth that's what God is Hebrews 4:12 says for the word of God is quick it's alive and Powerful that's the saddest thing I think when I look at denominations today like I said that panel of ministers sitting on a platform telling people God's not alive that's what they were saying That's essentially what they're saying is that God God lives in his word and he stays on the pages What a Sad place when Hebrews 4:12 says the word of God is alive alive in the land of the living if we want to put it that way and people are saying God's dead he lives in his word now he does live in his word but his word is where what he abides amen it's always meant to be in flesh it's always meant to be in a body it's not meant to stay on pages it's not meant to stay in his mind it's not just meant to come out of his lips it's supposed to be alive he says it's alive it's quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing AER of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of what the thoughts and intents of the heart amen God bless you let's stand if we would this morning church you want to know if the word is present it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen the word looks beyond what I know the word looks beyond what the preacher knows what the people in the congregation know it looks even beyond what you know about yourself amen have you ever sat in a service and the preaching of the word is coming forth and you see something about yourself you never saw before what is it it's the light it's the light of the word revealing who you are and it's revealing your current condition so it can take you out of it to bring you into your real condition amen that's why I said when we see that church we don't run from it we run to it we say God more more we're here we might as well deal with it amen I don't want to deal with it through a right Throne judgment I don't want to deal with it through a tribulation I want to deal with it now because the word is coming to me for a reason and it's to get me ready to get out of here amen it's the word coming to the word it's the Deep coming to the Deep what so we can come back into full fellowship with God Amen God wants to dwell in flesh again God is dwelling in flesh again but he wants to have the preeminence like he did in Christ Jesus amen we'll go there in our next service Lord willing amen I want these shackles off church I want this flesh gone amen I say Lord pour your spirit in this morning amen and burn out these things that hold us back amen every doubt every laugh sometimes we hold God back because of that doubt and all he's waiting for us to do is get in an atmosphere of Faith where we can say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how precious is your word how precious is your revealing

advised that this uh I guess around North America around the world this is Pastor appreciation day uh in my opinion every day should be Pastor appreciation day because he's god-given isn't he god-given to us and uh but we take advantage of the fact that it is Pastor appreciation day and we just want to give brother John and sister Blanca uh a little gift of a token of our appreciation and our love and for all that you've done for us come on up Sister Blanca yes um see she was called when John was called to the ministry brother ROM said right so uh I always figure that the pastor's wife is somewhat the unsung hero you know because they're behind the scenes supporting him uh supporting the pastor when uh things are rough and things don't go the way he feels he should be going and all that we discussed a little bit that this morning so uh uh so she's not to be forgotten and certainly don't forget to pray for her because she needs it to have the wisdom to help him when he needs that shoulder so on behalf of the church this is a token of our love and appreciation God bless you brother John amen and sister Blanca don't go anywhere I did this for my wife once in broad daylight and my neighbors Yow what did you do wrong so uh she didn't do anything wrong but she deserves this as well God bless you Sister amen praise the Lord yeah okay go ahead yeah I appreciate that but I was talking with brother Paul and sister Kimberly a couple nights ago and I just want to say how happy we are here how content we are amen you are a wonderful wonderful group of people there's no Slackers

see God moving in your lives and that is the greatest thing that's the only thing that's the only thing I want to see is Christ Living in you I don't want you to take on my attitude or my spirit by any means amen but we want to see Christ Living in this church so from the bottom of my heart from the bottom of our house I want to say thank you to each and every one of us that it supports Us by your prayers yes by your tithes and offerings but mostly by your presence and pulling on the word of God Amen it takes a church to make these things happen not a pastor not a preacher not a minister it takes a full body amen so when you come into service and Amen brother Bob when you're prayed up amen when you're ready you're seeking you're asking you're not sitting back you're pulling that's when God moves amen an expectant people a faithful people and I believe we've got that here so I say God bless you we love and appreciate you all and just trust the Lord to continue working in your lives that he would fill our young people with the the holy spirit amen that he would draw back those that are lost that are sitting out there that he would make their lives so miserable so miserable that the only hope they have is to come back to the thing that they can't seem to stand right now amen that the spirit of God that went and woed across and brooded over the Earth in the beginning would come back to those little frames those little flesh bodies and he would just woo on them until he could bring them back into his presence and baptize their Spirits their souls with his holy spirit amen amen God bless you thank you each one amen praise the Lord before we go let us sing just beyond the veil I don't know where the number is let's sing that and I'm going to ask brother Chad
