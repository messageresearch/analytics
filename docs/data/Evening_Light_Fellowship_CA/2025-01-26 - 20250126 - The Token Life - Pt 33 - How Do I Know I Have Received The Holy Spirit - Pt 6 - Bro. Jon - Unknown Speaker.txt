our guide we want you to be our inspiration Heavenly Father Lord we want to know that we're led by the spirit of God as sons are supposed to so Lord we're committing Our Lives once again to you this morning Lord not just because we're in church Lord but because it's another day to serve you and we want to be found walking in your willing in your way so Lord I pray you take once again this service Lord these notes Lord that I've studied Lord It's Your word it's your people Lord It's the flock of your pastor you are the great Shepherd you are the great provider Lord you are the word the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord I pray you would speak once again this morning to each one that's gathered here to those that are listening online Lord wherever they may be Lord we pray that your spirit would have the full preeminence again Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name name amen amen God bless you this morning turn if you would again to Colossians chap 1 verse 9 Colossians 1 and9 certainly want to show my appreciation and thanks to the church officers this morning as you know we're having our annual election and each one of them has served very faithfully and certainly as a pastor it is a huge huge help if you really don't have to think about a lot of things and so from our Sunday school superintendent brother Paul and he manages that so well and the young people to our trustees brother vichel brother Bob and they just they take care of everything I don't have to talk about it I don't even have to ask about it the few times ask questions usually it's we've already taken care of it or we've got a plan and they've just done a wonderful job and then of course the deacons brother Matt Brother Joseph certainly appreciate them and the hard work they do and the awkward things they willingly take on as part of their services and then brother Mark of course is the treasurer managing the finances you'll see as he gives his report at the end of the service us we're in good hands then we're not in brother Mark's hands but he's managing for us amen so we're so thankful for each one and I appreciate it I know it's a it's a burden of a certain sort and it takes time away from your families and your spouses and so your families bear that burden as well but I just want to thank each one of you from the bottom of my heart for your faithful service and then of course we have those that are serving without being voted in and they serve at the at the desires of their hearts from our musicians Our Song leaders the audiovisual people a janitor and all these different things I sure appreciate each one of you so God bless you this morning we're a body amen we're a body and we need each everyone to be in their place and I believe the Lord has done that in our midst amen Colossians 1 and ver9 same scripture we opened with last service Paul says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that ye might walk worthy of the the Lord unto all pleasing notice the standards him not us anden it's worthy in his eyes not in ours being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness and the church said amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we are continuing our thought on the the token life the the Holy Spirit and we're again continuing on this idea or this question of how do I know I have received the Holy Spirit and we've been talking a lot about fruit and we haven't quite come to the fruit of the Holy Spirit we'll do that today by God's grace but we've talked last service about what it takes to produce fruit just Naturally Speaking we built that Foundation through the last couple of services how that we're supposed to produce the fruit of the spirit and Paul talked about what keeps us from producing the fruit of the spirit then we went through what Jesus said there is a group that's supposed to produce the fruit of the spirit it's the children of God and they're the good ground and they're supposed to produce something all the way to harvest amen and so we talked last service especially about that tree that's planted by rivers of water and we know that for a tree to produce fruit it needs a lot of water it needs a lot of water if it wants to produce fruit it can't just sprink enough fruit to survive that's not what it's about if you're going to produce fruit remember you got to drink more than what you need you got to drink more than what's allotted to you because you've got to push you got to grow and you got to drive your branches out and produce the leaves and the blossoms and the fruit amen and so we can't just get enough of the word of God to keep us going amen as Believers we're not just supposed to slide into heaven saying well I'm alive I made it no we're supposed to produce fruit that's the requirement of the believer is that we produce fruit because it's not for us it's for others as we'll see as we go through here today but that's a big distinction between just showing up alive and maturing and growing am me you're a child of God and remember we spoke a couple Services ago how every one of us has a foundation that Foundation is Christ but what we build on that he leaves up to us as in we can choose to build what he wants us to or we can build what we want to and in the end what we build is Judge so you can come to the end of this and you'll be saved and have nothing to show for it or you can do it his way and you can come through and you have something to show for it and I believe for a child of God we want to get to the other side and say I've got something to show for my life beyond just saving my own soul if we could look at it that way amen but we want to come to the end and say I became what he wanted me to be I did what he asked me to do brother brownan would say this he says now that's what's the matter with the Christians they don't drink enough you want to drink till you just spread out and let somebody else see it he says see push out get a testimony committed to God now catch the distinction here we talk about eating the the the the the word about drinking The Living Waters amen and he's saying it doesn't mean just read it see I can talk to you about having your devotions in the morning and your prayer time and spending time with God and that's the start of it but it has to become a part of you you have to apply it amen if all we do is we get it in our head we become religious but if we can take it and make it a part of us he says push it out get a testimony have a a testimony that tells other people what I eat Works what I'm taking in is coming out in the thing that I expected it to come out in that's how you want to be able to show it spread it out and let somebody else see it he says believe it step out on it claim God's promise just commit it to God believe it and then he quotes the scripture commit thy ways unto the Lord and He will bring it to pass whatever you want so we don't want to just talk about having devotions we don't just want to talk about reading your Bible and these different things but we want to say let's make it a part of us a tree when it drinks it it's making the water part of itself it's not just letting the rain fall on it but it's absor being what it is so that it can do some good amen but I want to do a quick recap this morning and it will be quick from where we started last service because I picked up on a thought and really I didn't stay with it all the way through because I had other things that I I felt to go through but I want to take it from Genesis again for those that weren't here and even for those that were CU I really want to build on that thought of of being fruitful and we open with this scripture last time and it says God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the Earth so we see that the first commandment of God to mankind to Adam is be fruitful and we're talking about the fruit of the Holy Spirit here but if we go to the very beginning it was to produce fruit and that fruit was the fruit of the body if we could put it that way it was to produce children and not just children not sons of men but sons of God Adam was a Son of God Eve was a daughter of God and the purpose for them was to produce more sons of God that was supposed to be the fruit of Adam's life amen they were to produce children of God by the will into the perfect of image of God that's what they were supposed to do now let's catch something here because the fruitfulness that God is talking about here could not be the fruit of their own body it couldn't be the fruit of their own body the method of producing children in creation was not physical intimacy the way it was today we know that because we know how Jesus was born Jesus was born what by the word he was born through a woman but he was born by the Holy Spirit that's how he came into being amen and so he was the result of the spoken word of God in the timing of God and he Mary was then overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit put inside her the word and then out of her body came the word and it was Christ the word made manifest amen he was born the original way he was born the correct way that God intended he was born in the timing of God by the word of God by the will of God and so when he's born he is the word because that's what he started as Adam and his wife were supposed to produce that way they weren't supposed to have physical intimacy and we've we've preached on this before so I won't go into it again amen but to be fruitful as the original commandment was given Adam had to stay close to the tree of life because the Tree of Life which was Christ amen would tell him when to go tell him when to do it tell him when was the time when was the season and then in being in the presence of the Tree of Life Christ the word then the spirit would have come on the woman and she would have produced the word again she would have produced a son or a daughter of God so it would be by God's will not Adam's will by God's desire not by Adam's desire and out of Eve then would have come the spoken word again so unless they could stay by the tree of life they could not be fruitful if they got away from Christ they could not be fruitful in the way that he intended keep that in your mind as we go through you've got to be connected to Christ in order to be fruitful in the way that he requires it says in God said behold I've given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree in the which is the tree yielding in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there's life I've given every green herb for meat and it was so so the plants and the trees and the fruit and the the vegetables and all these things in the garden were meat they were food for the natural bodies and it was a tended to sustain this Natural Body it had nothing to do with eternal life I want you to see that the fruit of the trees the fruit of the Earth had nothing to do with n it had only to do with natural life not with eternal life eternal life was through the tree of life it was through Christ the word amen but the natural body was satisfied and sustained by the fruits and the vegetables of the earth so it wasn't just for humans but it was for the animal life as well so notice now so the fruit of the earth is for sustaining natural life but the fruit of the tree of life is for eternal life two different sources tied to two different purposes and tied to two different commandments so to produce a Son of God they had to be close to the tree of God and then to produce or to sustain Natural Life they had to be close to the Earth and doing what God told them to do and so we saw in Genesis 2:15 it says the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it so to plant and and to to intelligently set things up so that things would produce fruit and lots of fruit because everything now is looking for this fruit amen So Adam has to stay close to God to produce children and he's got to stay close to the Earth and stay in his his position and stay in his job to sustain the rest of life amen the rest of creation is relying on Adam to stay in his position I want to say that again the Earth is is relying on Adam to stay in his position to stay close to God to stay close to the word to be renewed in his purpose every single day because if Adam gets away from the earth from the word then he's going to fail in his other job if he falls they all fall amen because if he stays close to God then he will stay in his position and he'll do what he's supposed to do and we know that what happened is when Adam fell when e fell and then Adam joined her he lost his Dominion he lost his power he lost his support he lost his birth right he lost all of that Dominion that he had as a child of God when he left the word he lost everything that kept him in his position so now it's on him and he's got to work by the sweat of his brow and the the power of his body and these things but that's a lesson for us to have this morning is that when you leave Christ the word you're left to your own devices and let me tell you Church my own devices don't match up to Satan's ever I can't beat him with my intellect he's smarter I can't beat him with my discipline he's got all the time in the world and he doesn't need to sleep I can't beat him I've got to stay in in contact with something that's greater than him and that's greater than me and that's always going to be the word I've got to stay close to Christ he's the eternal life that we're looking for then we read the scripture in Psalms where David said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord can I say this way his choc is the light is the is the law of the Lord his canoli is the word of God pick whatever you like for food whatever you like to do most he says this guy his Delight is the word he says and in his law do he meditate day and night this is a man this is a child of God that's feeding on the word not just occasionally this is somebody that's that feeds on it and meditates on it and thinks about it and dwells on it day and night he says and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doth shall prosper so a tree that's planted by water will never be unfruitful why because all it needs really is that water that water will bring the nutrients it'll bring everything it needs for growth and because it has an unlimited supply of water it doesn't hold back it doesn't have to to to to conserve the water it doesn't have to conserve the strengths of the nutrients because it knows when I use it up I've got more there there's always something coming in and so I don't have to preserve myself there's no self-preservation in a tree that's got an unlimited supply of water and nutrients it will do what it's meant to do and it'll do it in Leaps and Bounds it'll grow faster than any other tree because it knows that it has no lack amen and Paul David says here that's what a Believer is when they're just drinking and drinking ining and drinking from the Fountain of Life when they're feeding on the word of God when they're applying the word of God he says it's just like they can't stop it it's just doing something in them and it produces fruit and it produces fruit and the leaves don't wither and this person prospers in whatever they do because they're feeding on the right thing day in and day out he says he meditates day and night what are we meditating on are we meditating because David doesn't say if I meditate on the problems I'll produce fruit if I meditate on the circumstances if I meditate on how he's wrong and I'm right if I meditate on how they failed me and I haven't failed them no he says if I meditate on the word then that's when I'm going to get the results our thoughts need to be under the control of the Holy Spirit and brought subject to the word of God because if all I've been meditating on is circumstances and people and and attitudes and personalities and these things that's not going to produce fruit that's going to choke up my life that's going to to choke up what's going on in my life and so when I've been thinking on the word of God when I'm dwelling on the word of God what comes out now is instead of that bitterness and that angst and that resentment and that fear and that selfishness now comes faith and love and joy and peace and rest because what I'm drinking in is what starts coming out of me amen that's what the Holy Spirit does in a Believer we're talking about the evidence of the Holy Spirit the greatest one you'll find is that the holy spirit will make you feel feed on the word of God day in and day out the scripture says that the holy spirit will lead you into all truth that's the word of God so he'll take you to a place and it's not because you have to do it it's because there's a deep calling to the Deep there's something in you that satisfi when it feeds on the word not just feeding on it intellectually or by your mind but when it goes into effect in your life and you see it produce that gets you addicted can I put it that way is it okay to use that word you get addicted to the results of the word when you see God fulfill his promise one time that gives you faith for the next promise and the next promise and the greater promise and the greater promise so you can leave your your trucking job and you can start a company and say he's provided for me now he's going to provide for me again next year so that when you step out in faith and you move somewhere or you change something or you let something go you say I'm feeding on the word and he'll provide what I have need of he'll fill up what I have a lack of this morning amen it keeps you coming back you like the taste you like the results more than anything Braham says this he says we grow when daily you can't grow daily if you're only eating on Wednesdays and Sundays you can't grow daily if you only eat a little bit of in the morning you got to eat daily you got to drink daily to grow daily you know you guys know I I like to work out and I work out to stay in shape not to get big but if you want to get big and have really big muscles you got to eat like you want to be you've got to take in more food and you see these guys that are just huge you know how many meals they eat a day six six meals a day I couldn't do it but they do it because what they want to grow daily and so they eat vast amounts of food he says each day our heart hungers keeps moving on there's something growing inside of you amen you get bigger you spread out you can take more Paul told the Corinthian Church said you're maturing you're growing but when you ought to be teachers you're still babes needing teaching is that right when you ought to be teachers he says there's something in there growing pushing out making ger it's the Holy Spirit growing it's growing in you he says it's a new birth and if a birth is born from the out from the inside out the child it grows if it lives and if it doesn't it remains is that right a baby that's not growing inside of the mother they have big concerns cuz babies grow so fast nothing grows faster than a baby it's amazing I I put our youngest on the scale yesterday because I always not always most nights I brush his teeth and I have to lift him up and sit him on the counter and he's just getting heavier and heavier and I don't know if I'm getting weaker or he's getting bigger and so the decision maker is the scale so I put him on and he's 50 lb 50 lb at almost 5 years old where did he go where did that little talk go babies grow faster than anyone and when they stop growing doctors get worried Paul said the same thing he says you ought to be growing but you're having to go through the first works again you're still feeding on baby stuff you got to grow up you got to move on he says well when a birth is on the inside shouldn't It Grow he said the Christ in your heart ought to be growing daily getting bigger more powerful understanding things better can we say Amen forgiving can we say amen and walking on as God would until Christ be formed in you the hope of Glory I think it's so amazing where you can read a scripture and and and then you come back 6 months later and you're at a completely different place with that scripture you get a minister comes in and he preaches on something you've heard before and it means way more to you today than it did then why cuz you're growing you're maturing you're coming up to a higher level a higher plane in your walk with Christ amen and so when that happens what does it do it shifts our attitude it shifts our spirit it shifts our understanding standing and it takes us to a place where we haven't been before and we start to apply it and we start to believe it in a greater way and our faith takes hold of it and the word starts to produce itself in a way that it hasn't before it's just opening up and opening up and opening up I was dealing with a personal situation not too long ago and I opened up my Bible for devotions that morning and there was a scripture there that perfectly addressed it perfectly I didn't have to stop and say Lord is that you I said Lord that's you now it hurt because it put me into a position of growth it put me into a position where I have to humble myself and do what the word says rather than what this flesh wants but I said praise the Lord that you didn't leave me questioning what I needed to do you showed me very clearly what was in your word for me to do and so now that's all it's left is for me to do it see I fed on it by reading it but now I got to feed on it by putting it into action that's really what we're talking about amen it's only going to make me grow if I make it part of me it's only going to grow if I take it down and I digest it and I really eat it and really consume it rather than just mull it over in my mind but the idea is to take it into my life amen but I want to jump ahead this morning now that's our that's our Preamble that's our our reminder of what we've been going through over the last couple services and I want to go to the to Galatians 5 and talk about the fruits of the spirit but I want to start well before the fruits of the spirit because the Holy Spirit had Paul give us this way give it to us this way for a reason amen I believe the scriptures inspired and I believe it's done in a particular order and so Paul starts out he says for Brethren I preached on this recently I know he says for Brethren you have not you have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another so remember we're not under the laws or the covenants of dos and don'ts we're under the Covenant of overcoming power church and so it's not now I can't or I won't it's that the desire has been taken away and I have power inside of me to overcome the fleshly desires of my life that's the Covenant we're living under so we're not in a place of legalism but now we're in a place where our Liberty is for service and for help and support amen I was praying the other day I don't tend to have a whole lot of free time but I was as I read this scripture and I said Lord where I have my free time help me to use it to benefit listen I need a break as much as anybody else but if every time I've got Liberty I use it for me rather than somebody else I'm not fulfilling the scripture I said Lord help me to be aware of how I'm burning up time of how I'm wasting time so that I can do something hey I may not go talk to somebody or fellowship with somebody but it may be that I read the better thing that I watch the better thing that I look up something and of course that I spend time with my family and these things and I tend to do okay with that but just to say Lord help me not to instantly switch to relaxation mode the minute I get a free moment my life's pretty hectic and it can be easy to do that but I believe our lives ought to be rung out we've got a time of refreshing but that's so that we can be rung out again amen our our our mothers and our wives know about this they're looking at me kind of grinning painfully right now us Brothers know about it two different sides of the same coin I think but our Liberty is not for S it's for you my Liberty is for you and your Liberty is supposed to be for me let's stop he says for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I want to jump back to Jesus words before we come back to Galatians 5 he says and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all what's the greatest commandment Jesus and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is this here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment we read this last service about how producing fruit in our lives we're supposed to give God everything not just be partway not just be halfway give them everything or give them nothing cuz otherwise it's idolatry it's something else that's there he says but the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these so if you do these two things in that order you'll stay in the word of God every time Jesus said if you want the laws this is it you do this that's it you're set because if you love God you'll do his will you'll follow his word you'll accept his word and if you love your brother and your sister as much as you love yourself then you'll treat them as much as as well as you treat yourself and guess it nobody knows how to treat us as well as we do ourselves I can pamper myself like nobody else I just can't cook we know how to treat each other we know how to treat ourselves well we're supposed to take that and use it for others now so that what I would do for myself I'll do for you and not hold back it's critical to get that order right because if we love our neighbor first and we love God second you know what happens we start to love our neighbor the way they want to be loved instead of the way they should be loved as parents we know what love means don't we as a spouse we know what that love means our love is not to give them what they want it's to give them what they need sometimes to give them what they want God gives us a desires of our heart but he gives us what we need his promise is for our needs and then the wants is really his Sovereign Grace and Mercy to us if if he would do that amen but if we want to be loved correctly it's got to be by the word it's got to be pulled through Christ the word amen you I heard a man speaking the other day a preacher he was talking about being merciful and he says he he said the least I'm paraphrasing he said the least merciful thing we can do is hear somebody say something that's wrong and keep our mouth shut why because because the only thing that's going to set them free is truth and so if we hear them say something and remember it's 99% true usually and just that little bit that's missing but if we leave them in that condition they can never be set free now we don't be rude we don't be egotistical we don't be pushy we're not trying to be overbearing but if we can in love and humility show them what the word says that gives them an opportunity to come up a little higher but it's not merciful to keep our mouth shut and so often we keep our mouth shut because we don't want the awkwardness we don't want to deal with potential rejection and so we'll say well that's just the way they believe it sure but that didn't stop the the disciples from going out and preaching the gospel to everyone that believed it completely differently amen we give a witness of what God has given us whether or not we feel good about how the other person's going to feel if I love somebody remember there was I think it was a a barber Billy Paul's Barber and he the his Barber he never told him about the ministry of Malachi 4 and one day the man came up to him and he was he was in tears and he says why did you never tell me about this well you're just cutting my hair I didn't think you needed to know I what what no our Mercy is in showing them the word our love is in showing them the word that's how we show a person love as we show them the word not to condemn but to offer them the mercy of Christ if they can come to the truth and they can receive it amen Paul continues he says but if he bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another nobody wins when we're fighting basically he says this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so if you want to defeat this flesh you've got to be led by the spirit if you're struggling with something in your life you need to be led by the spirit out of it because we get drawn in by the flesh remember God doesn't lead us into that we lead ourselves into it James said we're drawn aside by our own things amen but this is a daily thing walking in the spirit like I said it's not a Sunday and Wednesday night thing it's a daily thing walk walk in the spirit brother John how do I be led by the spirit find yourself in the word find your life in the word find your situation in the word and then stick to what the word says about it because the holy spirit will never lead you contrary to the word of God but it's a daily experience not a one time not a church experience not a an occasional experience it's a day-by-day thing that we do why do we have to do it he says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh so there's a war that's going on in every believer there's a War every single day he says and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would Paul's not writing to unbelievers church he's writing to spirit filled Christians and he's saying you've got a fight on your hands so this morning if you've got a fight with this thing in your flesh don't say that means I don't got the Holy Spirit the fact that you're fighting shows that there's something in you that's Waring and it's something in your soul and something that's in your flesh and what's in your soul is of God what's in your flesh is not and so there's a battle that's going on but the fact that there's a battle shows there's something inside of you that doesn't get along with this flesh that's a great evidence that you fight not that you give in yes we lose sometimes we lose don't we but I still get up and I fight again that's the nature of a Believer we get up and we fight and we fight but there's always going to be this dispute with the flesh he says but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law now Paul goes here and if we read ahead to all this you'd say brother John that is not in our church we don't deal with this and some of it by God's grace I believe we don't but watch what he says now now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these so he says if you want to know if you're doing what the flesh wants this is it adultery so that's breaking your marital vows fornication that's intimacy outside of marriage uncleanness lasciviousness this is all tied to sexual immorality and you say well brother John we don't deal with that well let me tell you if you're a man you're going to be tempted especially in this area 100% this is a struggle for men mostly not for women and the flesh desires certain things but there's a spirit there to combat it amen Paul isn't mentioning this because it's not in the church amen Paul's mentioning it because Satan is always trying to get his licks in and he's trying to put things in front of your eyes and in front of your mind and in front of your flesh and these different things so these are actions of the flesh now these are the works of the flesh then he says idolatry and Witchcraft and I've I've preached on this before we would say well brother John we don't have idolatry here we took all the Catholic statues out we're good and we definitely are not into witchcraft here but remember what Samuel said to Saul he said that Rebellion is the same as witchcraft and iniquity is the same as idolatry to God so to do something iniquity is to know to do something and not do it what do you do you make something else an idol ahead of God then he says Rebellion is as witchcraft what is rebellion self-will he says hatred now there's a lot of these words look very similar and as I went through these when I was studying I went back to the original words and I want to kind of open them up as we go through so if we could say idolatry let's say it's iniquity witchcraft let's call it Rebellion hatred is enmity deep-seated animosity variance means Strife conflict and disagreement or rivalry emulations these are jealousies by competition due to comparisons now catch this one wrath the root word here is breathing heaven I had a bit of a giggle you ever get so mad and you're just like and you don't know what to do it's outbursts of anger it's boiling agitation it's being worked up and letting it all out in a moment anybody ever done that nine of us we get worked up he says this is the works of the flesh Strife now this one's different this is selfish contentions when you're seeking influence and you have Ambitions for self-gain which lead to division and separation amongst the body then it's seditions this is Discord amongst the body leading to separations into factions or groups and the last one he says here is heresies this is a self-chosen opinion or doctrine that disagrees with the word and you gather people around it okay so these are issues of the mind they issues of attitude they issues of emotions that lead to actions catch this these are the works of the flesh amen I don't think there's a person in here can say that not one of those has ever touched them if only on the anger side of things I don't think I've known anybody that's never exploded at some point or another things just build up and we let go but we can absolutely get into comparisons we can get into they do things that I don't get to do or they have things that I don't have people like them better than they like me they're more accepted more appreciated that's why I try and thank everybody that does what they do so you don't think I've got favorites even though brother Bob is my favorite that's it you got two votes brother Bob we laugh we laugh but guess what if I go up and I spend all my time with brother brother Bob after service you're going to believe me if you've got that spirit I say that it's the flesh it's Satan trying to get in and divide us amen listen Satan will play your feelings and emotions like a banjo you you ever see those those uh those hillbilly Pickers when they're playing a banjo and they're going nuts and you're like how can human hands pick that way That's what Satan loves to do with our emotions with our mind with our thoughts with our attitudes he can play us like a banjo why this flesh is susceptible to him amen it takes walking in the spirit to keep this flesh from walking all over you takes meditating on the word it takes thinking about the promises and the good things and the pure things rather than the situations and the people and the personalities then he continues envyings this is grudges and spites that are usually tied to jealousy or rivalry we're not meant to compare we're not meant to compare what we're meant to be is in our place and do our own part heart amen we're meant to be what God made us to be murders now we do not commit murder in this church we are firmly against murder brother Bram says you can murder a man or a person by character assassination you can hit their character you can hit their influence you can hit their image their reputation and it just takes a little hint just a hint of something wrong can turn somebody against them drunkenness I hope we don't have that here but maybe we do I don't know he says Rings partying and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God God help us but he says now notice this is the works of the flesh not the fruit this is the works of the flesh because the works are the fun part if I could put it that way even letting go of all those emotions feels good sometimes in the flesh but then what do I have to deal with I've got to go and I've got to apologize after and that's the fruits if I'm a Christian listen if we let things go you know what's going to happen we're going to get humiliated and humiliation should lead to humility which should lead us to a place where where we say God I really prefer that not happen again and so we put ourselves down and we say God would you make a change in our life but during the work of the flesh that's when the fun is listen I've never committed adultery by God's grace or fornication those things but people aren't talking about the fruit of it when they're doing it all they're focused on is the enjoyment how it makes them feel the acceptance they have the the the sensuality whatever it might be the sensations and these different things but N9 months later sometimes you get the fruit don't you and you say I really wasn't thinking about that I wish I'd thought about the fruit but notice Satan focus is on the works not on the fruit if he can get you by the works you'll just keep doing the works because they're so much fun and then you reap a harvest down the road that you didn't think about because you were feeling too good when you're doing those things but the fruit of it always is what pain separation death disease the wages of sin is death scripture says it's going to cause bad things down the line amen watch what brother Braham says he says and a man is what he is when he's under pressure his real true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get them all riled up stirred up then you'll see the real man come out if he's got temper it'll show himself I used to say I don't have a temper but see what it is I'm really good at holding it me and Vel I'm really good at holding it it takes longer maybe for mine to go off now I don't actually think I'm that that good at holding it back if I was to be honest but what I wouldn't do is get necessarily upset at little things people would do but I'd let them build up into big things and then it' blow up he to get them all riled up stirred up then you'll see the real man come out if he's got temper it'll show itself if he's meek and gentle it'll show itself put him under pressure once he said and God puts all his children under test to see whether there's any flaws in them I used to do a lot of work with pressure vessels when I was back in my engineering days and anytime you do a pressure vessel you have to do a pressure test but the last thing we want to do is do the pressure test and have it fail so what do we do Church you don't know brother Matts knows Michel knows you do Quality Inspection and assurance and they go over it and they put fluorescent lights on it and they check it for cracks they do Meg particle inspection they do visual inspection they do measurement they do everything they inspect every weld they look at every material certification to say is this thing going to hold and then only when they believe it will hold do they put it under pressure because when metal explodes especially if there's air inside of it it's a bad thing it's a bomb he says God puts all his children under test to see whether there's any flaws in them because he doesn't want you blowing up at the worst moment he wants you to hold he wants you to be able to hold when the when when things hit hard see we tend to look at it the other way it's how we are 99% of the time that's what validates our Christianity he says no it's the 1% everybody does good when things are good so what's the test in that amen but it's when life isn't easy when conditions are rough when health is failing finances are are are are are falling out of the bank account faster than they're filling up when we're under the gun when we're under the microscope that's when the pressure hits and that's when it we really show are true colors he says this if somebody says sister so and so or brother so and so he's speaking somebody speaking of a fellow believer in some way don't you believe one word of it you just leave it go because remember it's the devil trying to tear you to pieces now just look for him to come in cuz he'll do it who Satan Satan is trying to get into the body of Believers now you let the good man so he says don't let him in what here's what you do now you let the good man of the house f stand right there and don't you receive one thing those people have been set in Heavenly places with you Hallelujah when I look around this morning each believer here has been set in Heavenly places in Christ with me we're fellow heirs we're joint hirs we're at the same level we're at the same calling we're at the same position we're together around the blessings of God taking the communion at the table and the the Holy Spirit has witnessed that they are the children of God so who am I to judge it's not mine to judge he says let's just be real sweet kindhearted forgiving loving oh boy I didn't see this in here yes I did and if the other person talks evil against you you talk sweet against them that's a little rough I don't get to get my licks in I just got to take the hits yep he says watch how sweeter comes to you then see you reap what you sow a soft answer turns away wrath if you come back with a hammer what are you going to get a bigger hammer he says see that's right just always return good for evil and love for hate continuing on now the fruits of the spirit he says but the fruit of the spirit see the works of the flesh was all those things now we're at the fruit of the spirit so if you got the spirit it's done a work and this is what that work produces the fruit of the spirit is love this is the nature of God it's Agape it's it's it's the the the definition of God God God is love God is agape this is him in his Essence it says the fruit of the spirit is Joy now when I looked at this it the the root is not Joy it says it is the source of joy in other words you've got a source inside of you you've got a Wellspring of Joy so it's not based on what the situation is or how you're feeling it's based on what you are that's where the joy is it's always there it's is available it says you are the spir fruit of the spirit is peace that word means you are complete you are sound you are tied together into a whole unit let me put it this way you know what my boys like to wrestle and and fight and these different things did you know that I'm at peace when I'm wrestling with my boys except Jonathan I haven't wrestled with him in a while but the younger ones you know why I'm at peace cuz they can't do anything to me I'm sound I'm whole I'm bigger I'm stronger I'm meaner if I got to be they can't touch me they can't do anything that would truly conquer me and so I'm at peace even in the storm if I could put it that way because I'm secure I'm not worried about what they can do and see so often that's our problem is that we get worried about what's going to happen rather than recognize izing where our foundation is and people will rage and people will get up in arms and they'll I've got a coworker that's always up in arms and I'm like you're going to go to you're going to die in early death you have no peace everything's bad everything's gone to Hell in a hand basket and you don't know how to get out I'm living in the same world but I've got a piece he doesn't have cuz I'm secure in Christ I'm resting in him then he says longsuffering oh my our flesh hates this one longsuffering patient slow to anger and it says this is specifically the quality of God in enduring and showing Mercy wow the flesh hates that gentleness this is kindness and benevolence seeking the good of others then says goodness Pleasant agreeable beneficial then he comes to this this wonderful one faith and the word there is actually not Faith the word is faithful it's reliable trustworthy confidence inspiring you know you You' you met these people no matter what happens you can trust them they're always there you can always rely on them you can always depend on them that's literally the fruit of the Holy Spirit coming out in their life then he says this I love meekness meekness it's humility it's calmness exercising power to help and assist others and then it says it is gentle strength like a gentle giant have you ever I've never met really a woman like this maybe sister Joan might have met done this you ever meet these guys I've met them you see him in the gym Joe Joe and I were working out the other day and and this guy was warming up with the weight that we maxed out at and so we went and we baited his knees in and ran away laughing gleefully he was so strong just big not all muscles just big a gentle giant and he's making things that we can't do look easy just a gentle giant and you'll see people like that I know a guy in in in British Columbia and he's always happy but he's like 6'4 and about 260 lbs and he wanted to play basketball against me one time now I I was you know 70 pounds lighter yeah I'm a little shorter but I figured I'm going to be way faster than this guy it's not going even going to be a challenge to beat this guy in basketball I don't think I scored a point on him he had everything he needed but he was so calm he just was swatting the ball away swatting the ball away I'd try and drive through him he just kind of look down at me and then throw me away and take the ball a gentle giant his strength was not there to beat me up he just was strong but he was gentle with it one of the nicest Brothers I've met in my life wonderful guy gentle Giants people that just go in and they get stuff done for you and they're not trying to hurt you they don't get riled up if you don't quite appreciate them a certain way they're just there and they get it done then he says Temperance self-control strength and restraint controlling one's emotions thoughts and actions now I think every single one of us can use some Temperance because we've all got areas where we're less temperate than others listen whether it's food whether it's exercise whether it's reading your Bible whether it's Electronics entertainment books whatever it might be careers making money whatever it is we've got areas where we need to be more temperate and guess what that's what the whole H spirit's here to do is to bring you into moderation to bring you into control he says against all of these against all of the fruits of the spirit there is no other law there is no no law so in other words these nine attributes of the spirit see in some things under the law you could only do so much you're only supposed to do so much but Paul's saying when it comes to these things there's no limit on how much you can have you can't have too much meekness you can't have too much patience patience you can't have too much longsuffering you can't have too much love this is the very nature of God and the more you have the better off you are and the better off those that are around you will be as well amen but these fruits notice these are the external evidence of an internal work it has to be the spirit inside of you this is not from an anointing on you this is from Christ Living inside of you pushing himself out the fruits are an internal work EXP exed outwardly then you have the gifts of the Spirit which are an external thing expressed externally it's for other people but it's not an Evidence of the Holy Spirit the fruit is the evidence of the spirit the gifts are independent because they have nothing to do with the condition of your soul we've said it many times Judas had gifts balam had gifts Caiaphas had gifts we said last service how that Rebecca had the gifts of Isaac before she ever got married to Isaac she hadn't even met him and yet she had his gifts the disciples before they ever received the Holy Spirit had power they had authority over demons over sickness over death itself but they hadn't received the Holy Spirit and Judas was numbered amongst them the gifts are just that they're gifts but they're intended to draw you to The Giver they're intended to bring you to the bridegroom Jesus Christ not so you can sit there and say and be warm and fuzzy and look how much he loves me look how much he's given me no he wants to give you himself that's the purpose of this is that you could be United with him not with his gifts he says there was no blemish on him and yet he suffered Temptation like any other man he's speaking of Christ yet he was scorned he was made fun of he was persecuted from the hour he was born until the hour he died and yet he returned good for evil what kind of character did that take that at the very end he said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing what ought we to have as an attitude when people do us wrong justly do us wrong not that they did it justly but that we know without a shadow of a doubt they've done us wrong what ought our attitude to be the bride is always forgiveness always forgiveness amen judgments coming after judgment comes after we leave he says you cannot no way ever produce a character like that he says only you can do it by accepting that character in you a church cannot do it a Creed cannot do it a denomination cannot do it an education cannot do that it must be a birth it's got to be a dying out and let God in by the grace of Christ to mold this type of character in you he says then you be become him and your life and his is the same then you are Sons and Daughters of God so every single one of these attributes ought to be in the life of a mature believer now notice how I'm saying that mature believer because it's only a mature tree that produces fruits you know we've got an apple tree outside of our house you plant an apple apple tree they say it takes about 8 years to produce fruit that doesn't mean it isn't an apple tree until it produces fruit it's always an apple tree but there's a time and a season as it matures as it grows that it can bear the fruit and it can bear the stresses that come with the fruit it's built itself up to a place where it can produce the fruit and not itself die and shrivel away amen remember we read in the in the scriptures a while ago that you're born a baby in Christ you're not born IM mature believer but as you come to maturity the purpose of a Believer is to produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit that's a process of time it's a process of eating it's a pro process of maturing it's a process of spending time with God and if you do that then in time you'll produce every single one of these fruits but remember Adam couldn't be fruitful unless he was in the presence of the Tree of Life his fruitfulness as he was intended to produce it was through Christ the word Adam was of no use to the creation if he wasn't eating from the Tree of Life he was of no use that personal dayto day dying out that relationship that closeness that checking in that inspiration that guidance is what we need to keep us in a fruitful condition that's the way it was with Adam the way it it is for a child of God I referenced this quote last service but I wanted to put it up here just officially and brother says here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word to feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning so he's looking to God is trying to produce the the the word in you and I that's why he sent it that's why he sent the spirit is to produce himself in us again be fruitful he's trying to produce God in in in sons and daughters again but he says we're formed to that word in order to what so we can take the word and feed the word to produce the word that's what we're brought in the first place then he would say this in spiritual food and due season he says now we notice here again if the word is in us and has come to us as it did Elijah in that day it'll do the same thing that he did he would feed on the secret things of God which is hidden from the world he says oh again it makes the message and the messenger is one the spiritual food's ready and it's in the season now he says for each one of you can have this food if you wish it if you're willing to steal away from all of the unbelief of this hour and if you're ready to come into Christ and come into his promise what is it what the world sees us do what the world sees us say what the world sees us live every day is based on what they cannot see which is the hidden life in Christ what we do in private is what comes out in public amen what we do in private is what comes out in public that's the hidden life of the believer and we cannot hide it even if we try to listen if you're feeding on the word it's going to come out you can't hide it and if you're not feeding on the world word then guess what that's going to come out as well because you're feeding on something else if all we feed on in a week is a couple of church services guess what's going to come out a couple of church services that's not going to do the job amen if all we feed is a SC on is a scripture here and a and a quote there that's not going to do it amen look at our natural relationships look at our marriages our marriages cannot live on a fleeting touch or a smile go try that doesn't work but what does it do in our relationships we have to have seasons where certainly we're giving more and there's situations where we're giving less but in the end they've got to average out to a continuance a constancy of connection that keeps us strong so that in the moments when we're super busy and we can't connect we know he loves me or she loves me but how do we do that there were times where we have an excess of time and so what do we do we reconnect why to keep the marriage strong we can't be super dad Super Mom super husband Super Wife all the time but if we can be constant it'll maintain the marriage it'll maintain the family unit and structure that's what gives us that Foundation amen Paul would say it this way in Colossians he says as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted what settled founded you you've got a foundation you're tied deeply and you're built up in him you're maturing you're growing in Christ and established in the faith you're anchored he says as you've been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving that abounding is speaking of fruitfulness you're rooted you're tied down you're growing up you're maturing and now what's it doing it's producing fruit he says but beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit can I can I put that into common words talk talk talk talk talk and no life I'm sure you've met them people that can talk your ear off but they can't get the victory they can't get along with people they can't stay in a church Church they can't Fellowship all they can do is talk talk talk talk talk philosophy and vain deceit they have no power just a lot of understanding through philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men and after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ brother BR puts it this way he says for Christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of people it's the simple truth we are not here just for each other we get along because we have the spirit of Christ otherwise half of us wouldn't be friends that's the simple truth you say well we would brother John we would but listen we don't all have the same Hobbies we don't all have the same interests your kids may not play the sports my kids play you may not do the things in your spare time that I do in mine but what draws us here is the Same Spirit under the same word that's what makes us it's Christ in our midst that makes us a church otherwise we're just a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of the people as a corpse bejweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filth all in all stay close to him he's the life he's the inspiration he's the light he's the strength he's the power what did Eve how did Eve get in trouble she got away from the Tree of Life she started talking to someone else philosophy and vain deceit she started to talking to somebody that was beneath her she started talking to a beast because he can talk he must be worth listening to church that's not true you've got to judge it amen don't ever let a child of this world give you advice for your life if they cannot give you the full word they have nothing to offer you and there influence is satanic that's hard but it's true Satan gave Eve 99% truth One Lie One Lie changed the entire course of this world because she believed it if your advice does not include the word it is satanic we're to be led by the spirit as we start to wrap this up this morning we talk about the fruits of the spirit we have all those fruits those nine fruits through the spirit and we got a lot of homework to do I think don't we say Lord I I've had I've had situations this week where I could say I failed in those areas I got a lot of homework to do I got things that God needs to change in my life why because who is the fruit for I preached a whole service on this before but I want to touch on it again we're talking about this this the the beautiful fruit of the attributes of God of the Holy Spirit but what's this purpose what's what's it it produced for is it for because remember the Holy Spirit produces them in us but not necessarily for us remember I have to receive the nature of God I've got to receive the benefits of God before I can ever give them I can't love like God does until I receive the love of God I can't have the patience and and peace and and longsuffering of God unless I've receive that Jesus said freely you've received freely give I've got to get it before I can give it but do I need my own fruit well you could say John you need patience sure I do I need patience do I need love for myself the world teaches a lot of self Lov these days yes sure I need the love of God so we need to let that love of God work in us before it can work through US absolutely but once it does I'm not producing fruit for myself I'm producing fruit for everybody else that's the purpose of it when a tree produces fruit the fruit is not for itself it's for the animals that walk by that come and stay in its branches it's for the passer by the person that comes by and wants to eat of the fruit the tree what does it do it takes the nutrients in the water and that's a hidden process but out of that hidden process come the fruits amen and it pushes out those fruits for everyone else it's not intended for the tree the tree really only gets the leftovers if if nobody comes and picks that tree then that fruit drops off and it rots and it gives nutrients back to the ground so the tree can take that and produce more fruit sometimes nobody's picking our fruit because we're not letting them get near we're trees that can walk if I can put it that way aren't we I can choose to separate myself from people picking my fruit and we'll get into why we do that but that fruit is the sacrifice of the tree it's the nature of the tree to produce it but it's a sacrifice because it's for others not for itself it's the offering of the tree it's meant to sustain others not itself amen my patience isn't for me my joy isn't for me my rest isn't for me my longsuffering isn't for me it's for you that's what it's meant to do I have Christ that's why I don't need what you have necessarily I have Christ I've got something inside of me that's producing what I have need of he's my Joys he's my peace he's my rest he's my love love he's my longsuffering man He's My All In All and it's because I have him that I can give what I have to you cuz he's the fountain that never runs dry he's the the flowing Waters of life amen we're planted by those streams of Living Water so I don't have to worry about tomorrow and whether I'm going to have fruit because I've got life inside of me Adam kept going back to that tree of life brother BR would talk about how in the evenings he would come in and he would lay down and and and Christ would be there and they would lay their heads and he would smooth their their their their head and their brows and and make make them feel so calm and warm and and loved and he would say go to sleep now in my presence it was a constant reunion and a and a relationship with God Amen and that's the way it's supposed to be for us is we know we have a fountain but will we keep drinking from it we know we have a source we know we have a strength that comes from Beyond us but the question is will we drink or will we not I don't need my fruit for me I need it for you and you need it from me puts it this way he says I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in speaking in tongues but I think we lay too much emphasis on that a man can speak with tongues and a woman speak with tongues and in her life and his life doesn't compare with the what tongues you're speaking in then it's the wrong tongue because the holy spirit will make you act like the Bible it'll bring you to the fullness of the stature of Christ he says you take a person that speaks with tongues with enough temper to fight a buzz song and talk about the neighbors and everything like that he says why you call that the Holy Ghost it cannot be no sir the Holy Ghost is meekness joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience faith it is that's it that that's its Essence that's its nature he says the Holy Ghost that's the fruit of the spirit that the Holy Spirit bears in the Church of the Living God sweetness and humbleness humility love for one another and longsuffering if a brother has gone wrong just can't just don't don't just beat him or something another go after him and see if you can get him back watch this don't wait for the preacher to do it you do it somebody else the preacher can't do it all neither can the deacons everybody is a member of this body of Christ and should go after one another and if we have the spirit of Christ in us he taught us the great Parable they left the 90 and n and went after that one that's what we're supposed to do but we say oh let them go we should never do we never should do that we should be gentle forgiving longsuffering that's the fruit of the spirit but why do we begrudge people from eating our fruit I'll pick patience or longsuffering how many of us want to go into situations where people try our patience because that's what that's what eating our fruit is is it tries it it takes it away from us why do we stay out of those situations why do we stay out of situations where somebody always makes us angry because we're worried we're running out of fruit we're worried that what we have will not last the encounter we've used up what we had and we haven't produced anymore the only thing that stops a tree from producing is when it stops drinking and if we're dry in our personal life we have no fruit to help our brother and sister or our neighbor or our community or our co-workers or these different things when we're down to that last fruit of patience you've always seen that thing that says I've only got one nerve left and you're getting on it that's the way we feel sometimes AR doesn't it why because we haven't been drinking we haven't been drinking now I'm not going to say that as a Believer you should go out constantly and put yourself in situations for people to eat your fruit we've got to be led we've got to be led but if the leading always keeps us home it's not his leading somebody's supposed to eat our fruit if you can receive that this morning somebody needs our fruit so we're down to our last fruit of patience we're down to our last fruit of meekness and if he says that one more time or he does that one more time he's going to get it Moses was the meekest man on Earth and Moses had maybe the greatest Authority given to a man in the scripture aside from Jesus Christ everything he did God God would honor it Moses spoke and things happened he was a meest man on Earth but one day his temper let go and what did it do it lost him his opportunity to go into the promised land Moses had been pushed too far and he took it on himself to take control the situation and that's when he caused the damage God didn't judge the people for that God judged Moses for it what is it we've got to go back to that tree of life every single day you ever notice when you have a lot of money you give money really easily you have a lot of food you'll have people out when we have a lot we give it very freely and very easily now some people will do that even when they have a little and that's the way we ought to be is that regardless of what we have we give as he leads us to give amen but why do we give so easily when it's all there because we got no worries there's they can't use up my money they can't use up my patience they can't use up my grace man if we were all millionaires we wouldn't have any issue with giving money because we got tons of money if I made a million bucks a year I would I need a million bucks a year I could give half of it away and still live like a king I be right in checks left right in center anybody that needed it why cuz I've got a lot of it question is why don't we have much fruit Jesus said I would that you would bear much fruit brother John I got patience how much patience you got but when somebody constantly draws down our patience what do we do eventually we say you know what I'm just going to avoid him instead of saying what God I really need to be in your presence today because that brother clearly needs what I've got nobody else seems to want to hang out with him nobody else wants to seem to do that Lord can you fill up my tank so I can push out the patience so I can push out the grace so I can push out the mercy the longsuffering the love whatever that might be but instead we adjust to the thing that makes life easier for us rather than doing the harder work of getting into the presence of God and getting rejuvenated and drinking in more so we can push out more we lack so we stop offering rather than going to get more so we can offer more that's our human nature that's the works of the flesh these things are a sacrifice it's a sacrifice to let somebody keep picking your fruit and not give you any of theirs listen if I go by and I pick something from an apple tree what do I give that apple tree nothing I just take it and go that's what he's there for that's what we are we're there for people to eat our fruit but it's when they don't let us pick theirs that's when we get a little bit prickly let's be honest right takers not givers when I was moving into pastorship I was I had a number of pastors spoke to me and paraphrasing they said you'll get 80% of your help from 20% of your congregation most are takers the rest are giv sorry yes most are takers the rest are givers by God's grace I don't believe that's our church but I have been in places where that's it and you have a tiny group of people that give and give and give and everybody else gets the benefit even though there are others that could absolutely be doing the work and helping out in these different things amen that ought not to be as we become in as we come into maturity as a Believer we ought to be giving more and taking from Christ amen we've got a place where we can go to develop these things it's a real sign of maturity when somebody says how can I help not what do you have for me also falls on us I guess to let people know how to help sometimes we've got a communication problem where there's all sorts of needs and we don't talk about it well that's how we can get people to help as we let them know there's a need and they'll do it as we start to close he says they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust this is the hard work remember it talked about the works of the flesh now here's the work of the Spirit In the Flesh it crucifies it the affections and the lust this is the hard work this is the daily struggle is to crucify this flesh because if we don't do this then the fruits of the spirit are going to get choked out he says if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit let us not and he gives us these three admonitions let us not be desirous of vain Glory so let us not be boastful talking up our gifts or contributions let us not provoke one another this one means challenging and calling each other out for shortcomings the scripture says that I should confess my fault to you not that you should tell it to me right this is not the scripture is not that of calling out prophets call out you got to have thus sayeth the Lord to do that and if maybe I'll say it this way when you see a gross and glaring fault in me come talk to me that's what the scripture says and if I see one in you I'm supposed to come talk to you in humility the scripture says lest we also go into the same thing that's how we deal with shortcomings first if we're not willing to talk about it with God then we don't get to talk about with anybody else and so we take it to God in prayer and we commit it to him but if we can't let it go in humility you come talk to me or I come talk to you that's it nobody else needs to be involved that's the way it works and then he says let us not be envying one another jealousy by way of comparison so the fruit remember Adam Adam comes to the tree of life and he has eternal life he's sustained he's rejuvenated he's strengthened day by day and from that basis from that Wellspring of life he goes out and he gives life to everyone else he gives the fruit he produce helps the fruit produce he helps the ground produce the fruit and these different things animals don't have Christ they have us to help them in their way we're walking around this world and guess what we're dealing with church animals beasts remember I said the last service that a a a a man or a person without the Holy Ghost is a beast Peter called them brute beasts that's what we're dealing with today is brute Beast church and they have no access to the tree of life and so what they're relying on until they get to that tree of life is your fruit to keep them going day by day that's the only source that they have our attitude could determine their Eternal destination the prophet of God said why because until they come to Christ all they have is an opportunity by works to receive eternal life and our attitude our reaction our action could determine their action and reaction and if ours is right then theirs can be right and it gives them an opportunity remember in that day they said he says you know enter in he said because when I was hungry you fed me when I was naked you clothed me and these different things they said 'h did we do it he said 'h you did it to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me our attitude the fruit of the spirit coming out of our life gives people that opportunity if I'm angry if I'm grumpy if I'm short-tempered if I'm never out people have no opportunity people often won't see Christ until they see us they'll see religion but they won't see Christ Adam had to stay with Christ so that he could go out and help feed those brute beasts amen they have to eat your fruit until they can come to their own source if I could put it that way until they come to Christ they're left with the fruit off of your tree to sustain their natural life to keep them going to let them Live Another Day that per chance they could come and receive the same word that you've got that they could actually see there's more to life than what they have we're the only living testimony In This World Church we're the only living testimony and if we've got no fruit then what kind of testimony are we dead cold twice plucked up by the roots no life in us let's finish in the Book of Revelation started with the tree of life and watch How It Ends in revelation 22 he says and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb and in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the tree was there the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him even in eternity even in Perfection there's still fruit being produced but notice here this is not just any tree it says it's producing 12 different types of fruit and every month it produces a different fruit and what is it for it's for people the fruit is for people the fruit that you produce is for a person it's not for New Finland it's not for Canada it's not for North America it's for the people that come your way eternal life is not to a nation it's never been that way with Israel it was never to the nation it was to the faith Nation not to the Natural Nation but our fruit is for people and it's to draw them to Christ it's so that they could could see something that they've never seen before so what God gives us is for a people and up there it's for a people it's for eternal life up there but notice how we spoke about leaves and we said even if you're not at the fruit bearing stage a tree with leaves still has great benefit it's a shade it's a shelter it can protect you from the Sun maybe protect you from the wind and these different things and up there it says the leaves of the tree were for the healing of Nations that the Kings could come in and they could sit under that tree and it would bring peace where there was never peace before listen Donald Trump thinks he's going to bring peace let me tell you he ain't bringing peace no man can do it no man can do it remember what's going to happen is is that Satan's going to be incarnate in a man and he'll bring peace for six months the whole world will be at peace for 6 months and they think they've got it made and then he breaks it he cannot do it only God can bring it and it's through the tree of life amen let's stand together for we would this morning it's not I can do it it's not you can do it it's going to take Christ in you to do it I love how brother Braham said he says you can't produce that character on your own you know what that you know what we do when we do that we do an impersonation and you know what happens to impersonators they're always exposed they're always exposed we always see what they are in reality and it takes time to do that but if you got him on the inside then what it'll do it'll expose Christ in your life and people will be able to see that and they'll be able to see a difference between you and just a religious person you and just somebody that goes to church because the fruit of your life is something that they can taste that they can experience that they can come to and you don't flashback the way other people do and you're understanding and you're patient and you listen and you're able to give them advice from the word of God in these different things that's what God's looking for as people that can be the word with flesh on it that can produce him all over again and the thing is it takes a suppressing of this flesh and the only way we're going to do that is by the holy spirit amen remember this is leoa people's rights somebody does us wrong we have every right every civil every legal right to respond as they say and do to us but remember we've got the nature of a lamb got the nature of a dove that when he was riled upon he riled not back and he forgave them in what they were doing that's what people are looking for we can talk about the truth we can talk about the message of the hour we can talk about this age wherein we can place ourselves in the scripture but if we can't place the scripture in us then what are we just religious the work of the spirit is what he's looking for the fruit out of our Lives amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father lord it's challenging this morning no doubt Lord I'm challenged by what I'm hearing and but I'm what I'm reading Lord in heaven knows there's many areas in my life that need to be strengthened Lord we know the answer though is to keep drinking Lord It's to stay close to Christ the word the Tree of
