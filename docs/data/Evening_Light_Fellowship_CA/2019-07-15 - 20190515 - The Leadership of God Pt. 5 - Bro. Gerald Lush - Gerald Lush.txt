because this was God's plan purpose and pattern is to bring forth the love of God in his sons and daughters he may that's why he allowed that he allowed to happen what happened a man to cause us to be tested to we were testing a man and to bring hurt our love for him and see he wants someone to love him not because they're created to love you but because they know him and they love you amen the Angels the angels were there to talk God they were created with that with that nature and they and they love God but God wanted his sons and daughters to love him for who he is amen and as I said to know the mister love it and then oh god he's so loving by the grace of God so brother game like Sanders is the reason why God permitted what he permitted and brother thank God for the for the profit of the hour thank God for the promise to reveal the mystery of God so that we would know why why what was God's purpose was God's reason that he would he would allow these things to happen in the Garden of Eden not only that but going back to heaven that he would a lot even allow those things to happen with the devil and his angels amen and then he got lifted up with pride and fall and we're living in an hour to this day in this age brothers started with pride it's ending with pride oh yeah it's a generation now that's being lifted up with pride whether they're politicians or with no matter I won so he I was going to mention a certain profession but regardless of the profession they're looking for pride pride in what they do pride in how they do it but brother they're gonna they're gonna they're not going to give the glory to God they're gonna take the glory unto themselves and brother that's not what God is looking for in his sons and daughters they're gonna give the glory to you man whether it's you in your school with her shoe in your job with a shoe in your home and then they feel this is good this is good that's good well thank the Lord praise the Lord amen as I said as I said everybody told the story of our sister burns how she said that the devil had spent two hours discouraging her two hours making the picture Luke black and after a couple of hours she was she was washing clothes after a couple of hours the Holy Spirit came on the scene a man and she turned around and she said all right Satan you've been talking to me for the last whatever 2 or 3 or 4 hours now she said I'm gonna talk to you and she rebuked the devil and she gave the glory to God amen her brother and she loved the Lord amen and the devil is there to get us to question the love of God amen brother when we consider what he's done and what he's doing and what he will do we don't question the love of God he proved is love a man and it's an absolutely genuine love you just sink when he was on the cross and he looked down and all that he gave already endured absolutely completely and totally rejected amen and even the day even Peter he said you're going your hey see you'll deny me three times a man he and airy was a disciple for three and a half years with Jesus and he declared Jesus to be the Son of God a man oh yeah Jesus who do you say that I am there are the Christ the Son of the Living God and yet when when the test came eat an item oh yeah three times he denied him the others walked away but Peter followed and denied him and denied him and denied him amen brother but God was going to give him what he needed and that was the baptism of law so he would see God the way that God wanted him to see him amen that he would recognize God's character the way that God wanted him to see it and wreck nice a man and the results would be long a man so much love that when he laid down his life he wouldn't he didn't want to be crucified upright he said turn me upside down he said I'm not worth Oh what the law they love the Lord when the Holy Ghost came and they got the whole revelation of Jesus brother love they loved him when they saw what he did and what he could have done oh yeah what he could have done what even Nissa Nissa don't you think he said I could call on the father and he will send me twelve legions of angels a man and destroy the world and set me free but he wouldn't do it he could would you oh I can do this and I can do that but there's sometimes God wants you to endure either a that endureth unto the end the same shall be saved a man it's not God has given us power over all the part of the enemy but sometimes you have to endure what the enemy is doing he that endureth under the end the same shall be saved endure what persecution tribulation oh yeah all these things that the enemy was going to bring upon us amen for the Gospels sake and because Jesus did it for you you're going to do it for him amen as he laid down his life for us we lay down our lives for him amen we're gonna bear the reproach praise the Lord for the glory of God because why because we recognize he loved us now we're gonna love him amen by the grace of Almighty God we're not going to crucify them if they want to crucify us that's up to them amen and we're witnessing the second crucifixion of the word amen it is the word in the bright God elfish

let you have your way for your glory your honor Alleluia and your praise in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen hallelujah hallelu now I Billy [Music] Oh Marsh Ripple [Music] Oh amen praise the name of the Lord god bless you amen turn with me dudes First Samuel Chapter eight first time you Chapter eight amen the grace of God be with us as we go to his word God wants to lead us by His Word and in 1st Samuel Chapter eight and beginning to read at verse 1 and it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel now the name of his firstborn was Joel the name of his second Abhaya and they were judges in Beersheba and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre or money and took bribes and perverted judgment unlike Samuel they were not led by the spirit a man they were led by human flesh free desires and it says then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel onto Rama and said unto Him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations a man regardless of Samuel Zeze should have remained under his leadership a man but the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord a man and the Lord said unto Samuel arkin unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me a man not rejecting Samuel it was rejecting God not rejecting the ministry as rejecting the Lord a man and in verse 10 and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king a man and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself a man and for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots that things would be required of them under a king that wasn't required to them under the prophet or the leadership of God a man and on down to verse 19 nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they say nay but we will have a king over us a man that we also may be like all the nations but there are those again that our believers they want to be like the denomination's a man the spirit of the attitude the motives the objectives as it was with Israel so that we also may be like all the nations and that our King may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles well didn't the Lord do it a man he did and that's why they were free that's why they had the Liberty that they had that's why they had the blessings that they had is because they follow God's leadership through his servant Samuel amen and Samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord well God knew what they said God knew what they were thinking a man and God knew it before he told Samuel to go ahead and listen to them do what they want a man because God a man God permitted it it was a permissive will of God Amen because God was going to punish Israel God was going to chase them Israel Israel is going to pay a price for failure for failing to follow his leadership a man brother/sister and the same thing with you and me we don't follow God's leadership we pay a price Amen God Elvis andus and you heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord and the Lord said to Samuel arkin unto their voice and make them a king amen and Samuel said unto the men of Israel go ye every man in unto rather is City amen go ye every man unto his city god bless to work the reading of the word you may be seated and this was a text that the prophet of God used in the Ministry of a message that he preached again in 1960 and it was entitled the rejected King amen they read they rejected a king so that they could have another king they rejected their heavenly king and their spiritual king so that they could have a natural king like you like the nations that were around they wanted to refuse the leadership of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords but they wanted the leadership of the King legged like was over the other nations and natural king not a spiritual King now the one that samuel was representing not the one that Sammy was taking a stand for a million but he wanted a political king a man whether we want a spiritual king and not a political one by the grace of Almighty God and you a new one and you want a spiritual ministry and not a not a religious ministry a man it's got to be the leadership of the Holy Ghost and what they're refusing was Samuel but they're refusing the leadership of the holy ghost in Samuel they're refusing the leadership of God in Samuel amen and they refused to be led by the Lord amen to them they were rejecting Samuel but to God they were rejecting him amen because it was not Samuel it was God in Samuel and they tried to use this as an excuse concerning the sons of Samuel a man and there are many that will walk away from the word today and the message today because there are ministries in there that are out there that are not walking as the Prophet walk then they are not talking as the Prophet are they they are not living as the privately if they do not have the attitude or the motives of the objections with the spirit that the Prophet had a man that's right there they go there because they wanted this kind of a spirit or that kind of history they're looking maybe more for more somebody like our brother Oral Roberts and all due respect to brother Roberts looking for somebody more like maybe Billy Graham yelling and other evangelists that would do this and would do this and would do that amen but it didn't want because boy with the Prophet was moving away from that to the word amen because why because that was that's what he was ordained to do therefore when the angel made him in the cane and the angel said he should heed now it's easy buddy I have the three phases as it were in your ministry and he said you're going to have this saying he'd sit in your hand and again as I explained it was his left hand and he would take their or their left hands a man and it was and it was going as to where from heart to heart and he would just he would know what what sickness they had he would know what their problem was a man he was deserted and speak the name of the Lord for their healing and then he said then he should after that he says you're going to have the discernment to know their thoughts and the intents of their heart not just the present tense led like reading somebody's mind but he said the past the present and the future amen and it was only a matter of a few months that he that he was using the first sign and he was he was telling them what was wrong with him and preachers would come up and they would stand there and they would look at his aim yeah they would stand there look at his hand and they were amazed because when they took the hand of that sick person then all of a sudden things begin to happen in in in the prophets and and just begin the movement that begin to move and the Prophet Rose looked at it and he said oh he said this is your problem amen and he said and they when they would agree and they oh yeah they said I said that you're right make sure with us say the Lord he should you're healed maybe you were praying or even just speak the word amen and then a Zain would go back to normal but then he said within within I think it might have been four months that a when he was using this sign and it happened in Canada I believe it was in the first time in this came to pass in Canada and he was he was doing that and all of a sudden he said he when he was in the prayer line using that first sign and he said then he said oh he looked and he saw vision and when this person stood before him a man any and he saw the past the present and the future oh that person that he that was there and he said always said this happened to you and this is what your problem is now and he would look to the future he said but the saved the Lord you're healed a man he said go your way and praise the Lord Amen and of course he would usually ask now is that right and he would tell them they're nice and now he's your name is this your name is that and you're you and you live in this certain city and then you come from here you come from there yes that's right sir you're right amen and he said this is your problem and so on so he discerned that within a matter of four months but it took a number of years he went on with those signs those first two gifts and those search through signs II when I'm with him for about seven years a man seven years and in 1953 seven years after he was commissioned to do it he said he said knowledge so we've had seven years he said of signs and wonders we've had seven years of divine healing and he and he says the memorial to divine healing amen and what was what was going on God was beginning the change is ministry a man from the first sign to the stand a second sign and he was beginning to move in the into the third which was the opening of the word and it was after 19 and 53 that brother Brennan because my brother round began to get more and more and more into the word and little by little by little at this revelation that revelation other revelation under they got into the church changers he got into the end of the series of Daniel a man and Israel and so on in 1980 19 and 60 and but still God was moving him on more and more and more into the word under finally in 1962 the the cloud of angels came down amen 1963 hear her Day in February 1963 that cloud of angels came down and he was commissioned a maid he was commissioned to go back to Jeffersonville for the opening of the seven seals a man and again that's a mystery science can't explain it a man it's not it's not an airplane it's not a flight because somewhere sale must be it must be an airplane flying there but science and no it wasn't an airplane why he said because he said it's too far off and it is too high up and there's no way so the plane is flying that high so a they they did they had no idea what the mystery was of their clown and they that was reported in a in a science magazine and it was also reported in in Life Magazine hate me they never they they had no explanation for it a night but what was it it was God getting the Prophet ready for the third Pole and brother that's where we ought to be right now is into the climax of the third Pole and I've already ministered honor and explained to here that amid that the climax of the third pole is the rapture amen and and what and it is reffering faith all that God has revealed and all that God is revealing and all that God is making real to you and me is is the rapture and the resurrection a man and is giving us the faith of it the revelation of it amen it's not just this doctrine in that doctrine that was all a part of it he had this sign yet that sign but as I said in 1953 he beginning to get in begin to get into the word and in any to this doctrine and that doctrine and any any brother the truth about the Trinity and he brought her the truth about water baptism he body the truth about about this this revelation and that revelation daugther revelation what was the leading to it was leading to the opening of the seven seals hey man hallelujah so of course again the Church agents and then the mystery of Daniel and I ended and the Jews and what God was our God was dealing with the Jews the Gentiles and back to the Jews a man brother sister but a but again we knew all of that before the seals by then all praise the Lord hallelujah then came the old me of the seven seals the revelation what was brother sister against beyond this doctrine and that doctrine and another doctrine the revelation of the mystery of the seven seals is the revelation of the mystery of God amen praise the name of the Lord is the revelation of the mystery of God down down through the Downs for the Old Covenant and into the New Covenant answer the Old Testament and into the New Testament praise the name of the Lord with Israel and then with the Gentiles praise God it is the mystery of God right from eternity down through time hallelujah glory praise the name of the Lord and it is the mystery that's going to take us back to eternity amen it not just to get us settled here into a doctrine is not just to get us settle here into into a church and will preach this and will preach this and will preach that know as to get us out of time it into eternity brothers to get us back home we need to get back home this is not do it this is not the home that we came from a million because why ain't million brothers sister God created the heaven and the earth but he said I'm going to have a new heaven and a new earth and the father God said exactly and he said he said we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and we needed to be born again amen and that's what the Jews did not recognize in the Messiah to the end of Messiah was the curb and to deliver them from the power the political power of the Romans amen so that Israel is going to be a nation like it was in the Old Testament hey man when a quitter came out of Egypt and we didn't and eventually went into the Promised Land this was the nation of Israel amen and all the other nations subject to it hey man they they thought well and they lost it and they figured that the Messiah is going to come and restore the natural political nation of Israel but the Messiah first brother had to come and redeem them he to pay the price for their Redemption amen and the salvation of their souls anybody so they make them new creatures then he wasn't even restore to them the kingdom then they then they didn't have not just a Jerusalem that ever New Jerusalem praise the name of the Lord hallelujah because the Bible speaks in revelation of the New Jerusalem praise the Lord and they they were they were satisfied with the old Jerusalem but brother God wanted to get him there born to gain and into a New Jerusalem hey you know hallelujah and there would be no sin there be no politics he-man and and the atmosphere be governed by divine law amen sir brother and the Bible tells us that God went from the Jews to the Gentiles hallelujah it's there in the book of Acts where Paul said he did it according to the Word of God and he said now so I'm going to go from the Jews and he son taking this to the Gentiles amen any any other correct I believe it was might have been Peter there because there were Gentiles that that God has sent Peter to and they believe that the preaching of the Messiah has the word to them and they went got baptized and Peter was going to get him circumcised and applause in no way he said he said they are already circumcised they but Peter thought they should be circumcised naturally but God had circumcised him spiritually amen brother sister they got there naturally and physically and humanly they got religion but God wants us to have have it spiritually was the Holy Ghost hey man it may not not the notic read not the dead of the word but the spirit of the word amen this is what God wants in you and in me he brings us out of that so we're not into religion we're not into the word naturally without into the word intellectually that we have come into the spiritual revelation of the word and we are seeing God and we are seeing the plan of God and the purpose of God and the pattern of God amen brother never seen the end of God's plan and purpose and pattern we're seeing the end of God dealing with the Gentiles are going back to the Jews amen I think I got getting right Waseda and recognizing that God wants us to come back under his leadership now the leadership of a church not the leadership of man but the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and again as the leadership of the Holy Ghost in in our Lord Jesus Christ is the leadership of our Lord Jesus Christ in his ministry because he said he ascended up on I and in Shawn but he said any and he said the age that he s set in the church the five full ministry bang to accomplish his will by the grace of Almighty God a man and show you a man to be led by a by the by the Holy Ghost you are led by the Ministry but again now you got to pray over that and be led by the Spirit to make sure you're under you're under a ministry that's led by the Holy Ghost amen because there are millions and millions and millions are there that are under ministries brother but they're they're not led by the Holy Ghost are led by religion - led by denomination and denominational spirits amen but we want to be led by the Holy Ghost and brother are we going to judge your judgment right or wrong by the Word of God what is the Word of God what is the will of God for this day for this hour so we're not living we're not living in what God did yesterday we're living in what God is doing the day anybody we're not living according to what God did yesterday we're living according to what God is doing now and we're moving on to my god wants to do tomorrow hey man by the grace of Almighty God brothers sister that's why there's going to be so few that are going into the end of that resurrection and into that rapture and I decoded area they had this message on leadership somewhere and where he mention it amen excuse me because the father got highlight of the fact of any and what did he do he mentioned about the number of those that would go into that wake of the Living saints that would go in the rapture and it's not very many I'm not sure if it said 200 or 500 now you consider what that is around the world considering maybe one seven six or seven billion population and there's so many a thousands and thousands and thousands out so in million Christians so you consider how many it's going to go in a rapture 200 how many is that for every country if it is 500 how many is that for every country it may that's not very many and it is 500 many is that for all the churches around the world everything is that for all the message churches around the world but again ladies Reno brothers going to be more than that no no no no okay because it is absolutely scriptural it is the Bible and her brother are Silverland let's be led by the word amen that our baby established on the word and in the word by the Word of God amen because it's going to see some when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth Strait is the gate now his way and do there be that find it amen and he said if I day is gonna be so bad in the last days if he didn't shorten time there be no flesh st. now if that's during the time of the tribulation well there'd be no flesh Saint I mean is going to win a rancher not very many amen amen amen God elbas brothers sister that we're going to be led by God amen oh yeah God leads us by his word that's right Amen but it's the word through a ministry a man it is the word whether it's in the Old Testament whether it's in the New Testament it is it is God giving his word like a to eat where did Eve get the Word of God Eve got it from Adam because God told Adam and I know that I don't totally and then and then I know doctors were asked were able God okay and came to it the brother/sister he knoweth anybody because even outside the garden they offered their sacrifices and eeny Meeny and he knew the like hey hey that was offering and and he got into an argument with Abel and he kill evil just think of that and then God come down and talk to him God come down and talk to him and still he refused God brothers the same thing in this day an hour and down through the church ages brother they they their dros a generation that that killed her they killed their the previous generation and then what they wanted and how they wanted it and so on and what they stood for and how they stood for it amen they were speaking out against denominationalism and church the church Hannity and so on hey babe Rosa generationally though they wanted to get rid of they wanted to kill them hey man they're under canes anointing oh they were they were worshippers they worship oh yeah they worship and I've gone through this years ago years ago how that you can trace churches you can trace your trail you know all denominations back to Rome you know or this one goes to that church that church that church then to the Roman Church and then you can trace it all down through history and you can go run out far come back can you trace it when it comes to the denominations and organized religion you can trace it right back to change leanings amen because after Cain left off talking with the Lord it says Cain went off here and Cain went off there and kate and kane may have been married and kk and these descendants and these are centers of these descendants a man and it went off into a form of godliness amen ray organized religion that's Astra you want to trace organized religion back your trailer right back to Cain amen if you want to trace the Holy Ghost religion back you're going to trace it back to Abel a man brother because his faith was in the blood was it was in the blood sacrifice on our front and our faith is in the blood sacrifice a man paid on we know they can able fate was in the land that he slowed and the blood that was shed but our faith is in the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world amen amen amen praise the name of the Lord not just two thousand years ago that was when it was all made fresh but it was in the mind of God before Adam before they knew every before they either rather than having in the earth that God created it was in the mind of God hallelujah that is not saying the Lord and brother brothers see how important it is to be led by the Spirit the Holy Spirit because he will lead you by the word a man everything where everything will be vindicated by the word a man yeah if we're up here in the in the lava to see an age but then we're gonna trace it right on back to the Ephesians and we'll go right on back beyond the Ephesian age we'll go right on back to in the beginning God created the heaven in the Europe not even to Eternity amen and when we will comprehend the plan of God the purpose of God and the parent of God and to know that it wasn't just after this half that God decided this then God decided that then God was going to do this then no it was all finished in the mind of God anybody thought ago that it was all past tense in the mind of God is not that I will be saved I am saved is not I will be changed I am a man but we but but what it is is by faith we're moving into what the past tense that God sees praise the Oh glory no wonder that says that the cast our sins into the sea of this forgetfulness oh brother not 2000 years ago before the foundation of the world because the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank God see I see how perfect it is brother and complete that it is all brother and again there's no mistakes I have no mistakes no there's mistakes a man's like these mistakes enhance interpretation and main thoughts but if no mistakes in the word no definitely not because we can we can trace the plain of God and the purpose of God we can trace it from eternity and from the Garden of Eden all down through time right down through this hour that we're living in praise the name of the Lord and brother the mystery of God the revelation of the mystery of God is the revelation of the plain purpose and pattern of God amen not just this doctrine that doctrine amen that after it's all revealed whether true there are Wesley or withers the old fashioned Salvation Army and the Pentecostals in the there are other churches that God has used other ministries they got issues other service they got issues a million it comes right on down to to the to the revelation of the whole thing amen it shows you the plan it is a revelation of the plan the mystery of the plane the mystery of the purpose and the mystery of the pattern Amen praise the name of the Lord see it's in this hour no other age as if we're going to come to church ages no other age recognize the pattern of God no no no they they they they knew that God had something in his mind and and he had a plan and he had a purpose that's why he was doing this in that age in that age and that age but in this hour he said I'll send you Elijah the Prophet that'll turn your heart the hearts of the fathers are the children back to the Father amen because we're the children let's get back to the Pentecostal father's a man and brother oh my god elders to get back to the truth the truth or to the whole truth the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen not just get back to old God has sent a prophet no God sent him didn't take us back even beyond the church ages the mystery of God is going back to eternity and the Alleluia Breyer says renting into the thoughts of God entering into the mind of God the mind of God in us and us in the mind of God so that we see oh oh oh oh this is this is where all this come from this is what he did all of this oh this is why we're here this is why the Eddy that he sent william branham revelation came amen in the days of the in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be exactly I just revealed finish any man the miss you've got to be finished it's finished amen yeah and when we're witnessing being we will see it's not what God has done is what he's done he's doing a man see the thing of it is all other generations all day all they were living on was what God had done what God had done Shree Luther what God had done Sir John Wesley what God had done Sir William Booth what God had done through the per day the Pentecostals a hundred years ago but the bride is entering into what God is doing hey man it is the finish of the mystery of God where we've entered the revelation that is finished and God know anybody and God is bringing it to pass God and God is bringing it to a finish he finished it and what's what's involved in the finish the finish brother is the resurrection the rapture the Farish he made his give is to give us the faith that's gonna take us back there's one thing to come there's another thing to go back brother he like I said he'd give Luther that faith and for four generations and he'd give Wesley that faith and he give the Pentecostals that faith I know and and there are other churches came up and moved on with it because there was the Pentecostal church and three and a half years after the Pentecostal church what what it what happened there was a split and and the United Pentecostal church started why because they wanted to go on with their are their ideas of the Trinity they wanted to go on with their ideas of Rome baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but they never had the complete revelation of it amen well they they and sometimes some of their thoughts were right but not all of it amen because they are hadn't come yet for the minister for the end time prophet in the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen and remember that angel that descended to give him the mystery was Christ remember that mighty angel came down with the cloud or with the rainbow over his head and that that brother that wasn't William Branham that was Jesus Christ amen because the rainbow represent of the covenant Amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah with the rainbow over his head and knowing that as it was in the days of Noah cuz they had a rainbow - that's right by the grace of God and God said this is a sign to you well brother was assigned to us everybody that he was here that he had come down he that made the promise was here to make to break the word to pass concerning the endtime concerning the resurrection concerning the rapture brother it's in the Word of God when it when wind and wind will that generation rise who believes in the resurrection of rapture when with that generation rise they were who's gonna fulfill the scriptures oh my I show you a mystery and we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed Oh where's that generation it's look there's going to believe that mystery where is that generation it will hidden God it's going to bring that mystery to pass where is that generation you know God is gonna vote fulfill that mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed see again I will get into that some other time where were the Prophet is saying that the living Saints are going to go into that dimension and meet the living that the dead in Christ in theirs theophany bodies and we're going all going to be changed into glorified bodies anybody not in this dimension in that dimension there will be change and avoid five bodies and then after a while we look up and there's Jesus coming down in the in his glorified body that's right praise the name of the Lord hallelujah brother sister we've come to that our trauma and world where where where is that generation who is believing that where is that generation who is preaching that where's that remember generation who is living for it morning noon and night that's all you're living for but brother where were that were ministering to a generation around the world professing this word and profess to believe this message but they're really living for themselves they're living for this world they want this they want this they want that and and they're getting more attention to the to the natural things to their to the spiritual but I tell you you know Noah was given more attention to the spear the natural yeah the RET spiritual revelation that he yet that's what he was living for just think well he well I took him 120 years to go there yeah but he didn't he didn't you're thinking but he didn't have the tools they have here today can you imagine how he build that art can you imagine how he did this an area today a man brother to say the same way with with our brother Enoch a man he was with God and was not but he walkin in the revelation of the word and the spiritual was more important to him than the natural oh no brother praise the name of the Lord and and then remember that was that was a seven for the Bible mentions it the seven from the first half of the seventh from the second Adam Amen even our Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord he was the second Adam the prophet of God I lighted it now he said he went to rapture now we're gonna be raptured cuz with us have in the seventh age from the second item our Lord Jesus Christ brother I'll tell you this loser got more interested in their spiritual revelation than he did in natural things of life amen before the revelation the faith struck him he was caught up with the natural things of life because he felt he would he would be justified if he did just did just did this know God wants you to believe God wants should I believe it's worth God why should I believe what he has done hey man that's it brother not what is not did you you did you did this you did that no no brother God wants you to want you to do it wants you to believe what he has done the finished work it's finished before the foundation of the world but now it's most definitely finished because the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world came in flesh and he was slain and he went back and he said oh they're just where you come from that's Ryan as where he was butter what a mystery what a revelation god help us to believe that we are there in that dimension a man jesus said no man has ascended up only he that came down even the son of man knew now who is now in heaven now what is hard the Lord you your ear your flesh and you're up there he he was up there why because he came he came any to his to his theophany and he came from his theophany flesh but because of sin we fight past not the afternoon that's right but he came down supposed to pull us back into our theophanies he came down first to put us in contact with our theophany and then when we go on from time to time from at a time physically of this body was going to our theophany amen we bypassed it because of sin and we needed jesus to come to put us in contact with our theophany so that when we died physically were right back there in in our theophany body but jesus came from eternity to his theophany at the opening into flesh and brother that was him he was among those three angels that came to talk to a brain amen praise the Lord he went from Fiat even from a theophany into that fleshy body and Abraham saw three men coming but they were three angels and he recognized one of them as Lord he bowed they recognized one as Lord and of course didn't there was the other two messengers that went down to life and we know that was that was William Branham the Lord glory was represented in written Brown his ministry a man but then there was all Roberts and there was Billy Graham they went down to Sodom and Gomorrah in where where lot was to preach repentance that's right one angel one angel was preaching repentance the other age or did a sign oh yeah like Oral Roberts the other sign yeah then there was the there was the other one they gave the promise of the word to Abram he said Abraham and hey I got a promised it years before years before he says Sarah's gonna have the son a man Abram recognized him as drawing Abram went out and got a sacrifice and brought in a sacrifice - yeah while those Angels win and listen praise the Lord thank God for grace amen I pray we're not gonna be left here when the fire falls it is falling but it's going to get worse I don't know you're aware of this but since January there was 250 people killed in churches and we know that even not long ago they went in attack even there a priest in the Catholic Church they've attacked others and then Moslems and so on 250 people have been killed if someone want to come through that door where a gun if they know what we believe and what we're preaching and what we're teaching it better be in prayer and we better be on that guy oh yes most definitely is you know it where it were heard about it constantly and this that this was since Ghent just since January this is 250 people and just not long ago Dewar's just a couple of days ago and Sri Lanka they attacked a church again and kill people are we taking it that serious I pray gracefully listen that that that I was going to come during the Great Tribulation because millions a number that no man could number said that came out of the Great Tribulation they laid down their lives for the gospel they're not Brian God has given the bride a higher revelation to give her the faith to take her higher and they take her out of time into eternity but I pray in the name of Jesus that you do recognize the seriousness of the hour that this is just not going to church this is laying down your life it's laying down your life many have laid down their lives over the years as I said sixty-eight Minden laid down their lives as martyrs for the Christian for Christ 68 in the oh yeah that was history what brother would get where we're living in an insane war we're living in a crazy world and brother even even though reporters or whatever they are out there in the world around the world they recognize that that the world is not normal anymore because of what's happening because of what's going on they know it's insane people kill people for no reason from you know just just just to do it just cut they want to do brother sister see you know what I proved it proves the scripture that the devil has come down with great wrath knowing is time is short and this time is short how short is our you need to take serious I start living for Jesus yes die for him too naturally this live for him spiritually so that he controls every area of your life by the grace of God amen so that ease so what so he's he's increasing your faith and you're getting more and more and more rapturing faith resurrection paid by the grace of God more and more conscious of eternity see as you see with oh my praise the Lord Jesus was getting in his ministry he was getting more and more and more conscious of that other dimension that's what he said no man has ascended up when he that came down even new EU is in heaven the son of a hey man he was more conscious on he was getting closer to Eternity and that's what I said I am no more in the world he knew his faith to face it in the flesh we're getting more and more real with more more conscious of eternity and less conscious of time I pray God in the name of Jesus Lord take away time promise so that we're not governed by time we're not controlled by time we're not led by Terry we're led by the Holy Ghost were led by the revelation of the Word of God they may and it's God through his servants he's like a man told brother branham one time he said I don't need a teacher Oh father God so you don't why not he said the Holy Ghost is my teacher yeah he said he is but he said don't forget he said the Holy Ghost won't teach you only through the teacher amen so I don't know if he believed it or not but the Prophet silence them the grace of God brought a God Elvis that we're gonna be led by God and how desires to be led by God not my name and we read right here Samuel they were led by God through Samuel but then they got to the place where they wanted to be led by a man a human thing not a spiritual thing not the king of kings that samuel was testifying about now they were getting ahead of the Spirit and they were getting more and more into the flesh grace of God brother listen I show you a mystery there with me we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed a man I think if we're going to be changed we're going to change we're being changed oh yeah because you're getting more and more away from the natural and more conscious of the spiritual God Alpha straight and it says in a moment in the twinkling of an eye yeah that's quick in a moment between even I win now at the last Trump I say at the last Trump because the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught with together with them to meet the law he said that the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed Amy that coincides and blends completely but first Thessalonians 4 and we and we believe that the Lord has descended from heaven with a shout yes amen the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ by getting closer to us amen we didn't know about it till this hour till this age that they were there because for generations we thought they're up there in the graveyards we thought they're all there in the cemetery yeah dust but that's the dust that's the curse that God put on dust thou art not the dust shalt thou return amen ready good lord but Saints by the grace of God you promised us a new body amen it's not it's not made of dust it's the spoken word how did oh yeah God said let there be let there be let there be a man God spoke spoke our bodies into existence Rory five bodies like these nor hide body Amen we which are alive and remain or rather he said the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord comfort one another with these words my brother you're gonna be part of this if I'm gonna be a part of that I gotta be the man by the spirit I gotta come under God's leadership amen I gotta come under God's leadership of the Prophet I gotta come under God's leadership of these five for ministry that's there for the perfecting of the saints grace amen hey five scriptures and only got to really want after reading the scripture we read in Samuel concerning those that rejected the Samuel and rejected God brother Brown said I'd like to choose a text of the rejected King don't be found guilty of rejecting God Elvis he said it was a time that as in all times their people as never wanted God to lead them amen he said they never wanted God to lead them he said they want their own way of leadership no God's Way not why my will dinah be done and he said they won their own way of leadership and this story this morning when you go and he said it was during the time of the days of Samuel the man of God the prophet and he had been a just man and a good man honorable reputable true honest with his people and he said with the people he should never deceiving them he said telling them nothing but the straight thus saith the Lord amen just give him the word just kill him daughter Amy God's not interested in our ideas no no whatever God does he wants you to respond with the world yeah brother Brown says God longs to be reminded of his words I like that yeah God loved right because he shows shows your consciousness of the word and that nature and that you're sensitive to the word so he said God loves to be reminded of his room Nord it is written not we don't have just said to the devil Jesus had to say it to believers too it is written it is written thus saith the Lord amen brother so he said during the days of Sandia the man of God the prophet he had been a just man and he said telling them nothing but the straight thus saith the Lord but the people that come to a place he said where they wanted to change this program and it said they had looked upon the Philistines the Amalekites the amorite the Hittites and the other nations of the world and they had seen that they had Kings that rule them and govern them and guided them and fought their battles and this seemed to be that Israel wanted to pattern themselves like these kings like these people no we want a pattern in ourselves like the Lord like Jesus amen through his word so that we're going to be resurrected and raptured like Jesus he was resurrected he was raptured now he's come back to resurrect the rapture wonderful he said but it has never been in any age he said God's intention for his people to act like the people of the world never God's intention easier to be for his people to be governed or controlled like the people of the world God's people as always has been a peculiar people God's people has always been a different people now called out separated altogether different in your actions and that's the truth that's the truth even where you work they're gonna be doing they'll know it by the way you think and act and react and respond do certain issues and things demo you might be a Christian she might be a Christian yeah they're religious you know you go beyond that than be spiritual so brother are you really different really sister are you really different from your friends your neighbors yes and in some cases your family and your family recognize that well they know you're different and you'll know what your faith he said different in their actions different in their ways and in their manner of living and either within what the peoples of the world as each of their appetites were things and all that their makeup is has been always country to the things of the people of the world desire amen yo you're not after the things they're after you don't want the things that they are at they they want no you just want to be simple you you have a God hidden and God revealed in simplicity not fancy colouring simple so in simplicity yes brother wonderful is God hidden everything you got a simple life you act except what you act simple you talk simple your very basic you you dress simple no yeah oh yeah showing that wide it's the Spirit of God I mean not to spare the world I tell you the world is getting crazy the world's getting absolutely insane and sometimes you see you see you out there and dress this way and their hair is this way Lord that's not normal that's insane how it is but a lot of love the word don't realize they don't think that you don't realize that as I saw one time I saw somebody with with your hair a certain way I said the world is that and so I went I went into a bank and I stood up blowing oh I saw some women there oh that's right where they're getting it I should they're catching that spear at the time damn and their hair was the same way nice to the Lord I said that best to spear the world I suggest foolish I said that's not normal no and it's gonna get worse please in the name of the Lord let's stay separated unto the Lord let let God lead us because God that's God reveal it to say him he said they wanted one don't want me to lead them he said they wanted to want to keep like a natural king of the of the world politics they want that king to lead them but they don't want me and it's the same thing today people want one1 when they're just spirits out there they don't mind them but they're basically main the most more and more the worldly spirits they want and they're getting more you know what it is you know why this is it I took it this is this age is gonna end worse than any other age because this is the insanity of the world don't take it for granted Oh insane oh yeah and justice just go on no no let let us strike your heart so that you don't you don't become insane so you're on your guard against that in the same spirit and that you will recognize it that's right but there's a lot of people don't recognize you'll get on them and they'll they'll do this they'll do that what insane but he's out the Holy Ghost you're gonna recognize that insane spirit and you'll fight it did you want you don't want it so god help my prayer he said their appetites for things and all their makeup is has always been men always contrary to the things that the people of the world desire amen and the people of Israel came to Samuel and said now you're getting old and your sons do not walk in your way and because they wasn't like true true like Samuel they were bribers and takers of money yeah and so on and Samuel tried to tell them and hold him in place but it would not work and he said if you do that and he said the first thing you know you'll find out he said he called you your sons from your home and they'll do this they'll make you soldiers chosen but God wasn't done do they know and he said yeah run run before a chariot you'll bear armors and spears no God fought for them he wouldn't he didn't expect them to fight for themselves no and he said besides all that he'd take a certain tax off yet so he said it's going to cost you God just asked for his tithes and offerings but it's you come under that natural king it's going to cost you a lot more but the people said we still want to be like the rest of the people and there's something about men and women that they longed to be like one another and there has only been one man ever lived on earth there was our example and that was the one that died for all our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he was the perfect example of what we should be always about the father's business and doing that which is right God help us to be willing to be led by God by his word by his servants amen in the word that we will have the faith that pleases him and without without that leadership you will never have the faith that pleases God never so I pray the grace of God to control us thought word and deed so that we all know by by faith that were under God leadership why because it keeps bringing me back to the word it keeps reminding me of the word it keeps convicting me of the word 98 with the word amen it is evidence of the leadership of God amen so that it's the word the word the word that's all that's that's the main thing in your heart and soul is the revelation of the word amen see he said Jesus alone can lead you to eternal life amen but it's by His Word that's right he said could you imagine him leading you out of his word which that's him and if he is the word and you're a part of him won't you be part of the word he said you have a choice a young man whether you're going to have an education or not you have a choice of your conduct and he said are you women he so you can look a decent being or you can be one of these weird creatures that have out there with them blurred blue dyes water had air cuts and they're completely against the Word of God but he said what's happened to you church he said you have seen so much television so much things of the world it's so easy for your old Adam nature to drift into it and to act like the rest of them well it's not only television now it's videos books and Internet is the world is everywhere that's the truth the world is everywhere you table was Satan well beyond your gun he's there to try to deceive us oh yeah and he's using everything in the end in the world to deceive us brothers say is like I says get into that place where even those cell phones all mine now you can you can you can you can get into anything on those no phone you can get into the internet you can contact this contact that and and online it's very deceiving be on your guard we thought we got to get back to simplicity it's the devil taking us that's not God if the devil take us away from simplicity and this is what God was warning warning the people through through Samuel he says if you go under under a political king he said you're gonna lose the simplicity of the life

come in contact with using it amen he said the leadership of God is to follow the vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost and he said we're living in an intellectual day education civilization the modern trend of the day is all of the devil just think of that amen he said in the spirit speaking through this brother a few minutes ago saying I'll take the stony heart out of you and give you a heart of flesh tender towards God look how has become he said just intellectual emotion and he said oh you're going to face Christ with an intellectual conception of him you can't you've got to have the spiritual revelation of who he is he said now he said listen just examine yourself by the word examine yourself by the message examine what a real Christian should be what should a real Christian me he said rugged he said loving not one of this modern Christianity he said why he said it's soft it's flexible he said F dead rotten and interbred see he said is not the real Christianity he said they live any kind of way and belong to a church don't you want that sweet fellowship with Christ he said the Holy Spirit the conformity of your heart he said to the word that's what you want he said move right up into Christ amen he said look at yourself and really are you a genuine Bible Christian full of the love of God all right consider that when you pray tonight are you a genuine Bible Christian full of the love of God amen grace listen he said the marking angel went forth and put a mark on their head forehead sealed him and then them that sighed and cried and after that come to slaughtering angels from the four corners of the urge the earth with just coming right away hey man we see it coming wars are movie right in that have killed a whole dearth off and brother I told you it's it's either cuz that spirit is now getting on everybody oh yeah whether whether there's people driving vehicles whether it's people just just going around in in churches or or in in pubs or no matter where it is during the mall just within the last couple of days I don't know if you saw it or not the police was called to the Avalon mall with a report of a shotgun being fired but they didn't find anything and they're still searching it it's getting serious when you go out you better go out in the name of the Lord you better plead the token Lord be with me today nor preserve us and protect us today please lord give us a viewer give us your wisdom and your leadership amen brother I told it about the German Allah cost but they killed the Jews I said there's coming a Gentile Holocaust yeah they're gonna kill anybody that's gonna take their stand against the foolishness of the world they will and they are really yeah grace he said Oh God let me go Lord don't leave me behind Jesus let me go with you father I don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on I don't want to stay here in this insanity I don't want to stand here when hideous sites the people losing their mind and they are we look at a man trying to act like the beasts and look like the beasts and the women is trying to look like animals and with the paints on their face and you have said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone we see it in the making right now Lord reached Elvis Lord restore us to the sane mind of Christ Jesus our Lord the same is say in II not the insane the insane - the devil we need the same mind of the Lord Jesus Christ can you see the insanity of this age look how it's gone there's no even reasons among the people no more no reasoning even among the leaders one time leaders they stood out you recognize them you knew them even after years you still knew them yeah because they were leaders they knew they're there to lead the people they were there to do this for the benefit of the people now it's just reputation and popularity and so on to get recognized even the evening politics there's insanity he say where is our churches our ministers will take people in just on probation join the church and do this or have a little sensation or something where is those men of God those prophets that stand out and dare to defy all the things of the world where is those man of integrity they're so soft and through intellectual conceptions and things they are not here anymore these idiots sites that's coming upon the earth you can see other people is moving right into it it's an insanity but when that thing strikes the church the right will be gone why because she's she's under God's leadership that was the conclusion of the message leadership December the 765 so brother the insanity of the world is a testimony that we're reaching the climax of the rapture because when the world comes to that that that insanity total insanity the bride will be gone by the grace of God he said it's an insanity but when that thing strikes the church you know the bride will be gone I trust by God through the power of the Holy Ghost that you under the leadership of God and the Word of God that you are recognizing the insanity of the world and that you are concerned about it and that you are hungry in person to get back to God to get out of this old heaven and earth and getting the glory with him and to come back to a new heaven and a new way and the Prophet said well what is the new evident worth he said well ISA what is the new creature in Christ Jesus he says you're born again a man from the inside out you're born again by the power of the Holy Ghost the fire of God is there in you so he said God is going to burn the heaven new the heavens and the earth and he's gonna be born again and I saw he expressed it he said we're born begin the new heaven new earth is gonna be born begin and he said God will burn it from the inside out he'll throw the earth into the Sun and it'll burn so that there's not one thing of sin left in it amen God does it the way this way for you and me a new creature in Christ I knew it a new body a glorified body dust the other one is dust gone and so on what for so that in the glorified body there's no scene thank God the grace of God be with us brother amen so I've concluded that series are not that series altogether with that message on leadership I pray the grace of God help us to make our calling and election sure by making our leadership short that's how you make your calling election sure is to be sure you're led by the spirit as we said in the scriptures sons and daughters of God and led by the Spirit of God amen God be with us Lord bless you this day it's 4:15

baptize everyone baptize us Lord with resurrection and rapturing faith amen God Elvis this is serious more serious than any I guess as this is as serious it was in the Garden of Eden that was the beginning this is the end that was the fall this is the total restoration back to eternal life by the grace of God oh how many are really believing it how many are really believing that we are finishing time and we're going to eternity then we're gonna step out of this dimension because we're so conscious of all this stuff what we can touch our scent right our senses our government governor Oh fire our census we can feel this touch that all we can hear this and say this and smell this oh yeah all with our senses I pray cause we're gonna get caught up and all with our spiritual sense they Amen so that we're gonna be more conscious of what it's revealing dinner what our scent natural senses are revealing well that's again that's the way Jesus was that's how he gets oh he got that's way Enoch was oh he had to be the edge of it he wasn't he was more sensitive of eternal things than he was of natural things cuz he he walked he had the faith that face God he walked with God he was not
