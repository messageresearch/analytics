[39:29] and so they took him to emergency and
[39:30] then they took him into uh emergency
[39:33] surgery for a ruptured appendix so they
[39:35] did that yesterday but because theyd
[39:36] waited so long the infection had had
[39:39] spread pretty badly and it was wrapped
[39:41] all around his intestines so anyways he
[39:43] can't eat anything they're feeding him
[39:44] on IV but he was up uh this this morning
[39:47] and seems to be doing okay so we want to
[39:49] remember him as well amen sister Beverly

[40:18] know what the giggles were I thought the

[40:21] blue-eyed beauty but instead they were
[40:23] thinking of the blue-haired blond eyed
[40:26] um mixup that I had talked about so uh
[40:29] anyways if you can't laugh at yourself
[40:31] you're not allowed to laugh at anyone
[40:32] else so hopefully we don't have any such
[40:34] flubs for at least another little while

[41:05] shall bring forth a son and they shall
[41:07] call his name Emanuel which being
[41:09] interpreted is God With Us amen God
[41:12] bless you you can have your seats this
[41:13] evening and we're continuing our series
[41:15] on what is the Holy Ghost and this idea
[41:18] of the indwelling god and we've been
[41:19] speaking a lot about Christ and we'll
[41:21] speak of him tonight I mean that's it's
[41:23] what we always talk about I guess when
[41:24] you think about it but we're speaking
[41:26] about the flesh uh the humanity of that
[41:28] man Jesus Christ and we spoke last
[41:31] service how he was born by the Holy
[41:33] Spirit by the spoken word and that was
[41:35] God himself creating that egg and that
[41:38] that that that seed there within Mary
[41:40] and she was a human incubator that
[41:42] brought him forth she brought that baby
[41:43] to full term he was born of Mary he was
[41:46] born of a woman and he was a perfect
[41:48] human amen he was he was the the DNA of
[41:50] God he was born by the word of God
[41:53] according to the word of God and he was
[41:55] the perfect image of God in in flesh
[41:57] amen he was a perfect reflection of God
[42:00] himself just like Adam was 2,000 years
[42:02] ago so or or in the beginning that was
[42:04] Jesus 2,000 years ago and we talked
[42:06] about how there was no sin in that body
[42:08] because he wasn't born by sin he wasn't
[42:09] born by sexual desire between a man and
[42:12] a woman but he was born by the word and
[42:14] so there's no sin in that body because
[42:16] it's a word body amen and if you can
[42:18] catch that Revelation you'll realize
[42:20] where you stand today when God has given
[42:22] you a word body amen and it may not seem
[42:24] obvious today what you have but you are
[42:26] part of a word body and it's only the
[42:28] soul that we have of that body here
[42:30] today but there's an eternal word body
[42:32] that's coming our way and that's going
[42:34] to be our glorified body amen but it was
[42:35] a word body it came from God it was from
[42:38] God it carried the nature and the
[42:40] attributes of God and that baby that was
[42:43] born was named Jesus or Jesus of
[42:45] Nazareth and he was fully human like you
[42:47] or I and we talked about this last
[42:48] service but he was not just born he was
[42:51] born and he was built for a purpose amen
[42:53] he came down because he's the word and
[42:55] the word always comes with purpose and
[42:57] so this word body comes and his word
[43:00] purpose is to pay the full price for
[43:03] your sins and for my sins that's the
[43:05] only reason he came in flesh was so he
[43:07] could redeem us and to redeem us he had
[43:09] to pay the price amen so he had to be a
[43:12] man he could not be spoken into
[43:13] existence just poof and there was a body
[43:16] there but he had to be born like us he
[43:17] had to be flesh and blown and blood like
[43:20] we were he had to come from a woman and
[43:22] he had to be perfect in his life to be
[43:24] accepted by God as the sacrifice for for
[43:27] us in his life of his own will that's
[43:31] when he had to be perfect amen was he
[43:33] had to do it as a man before there was
[43:36] ever any anointing on him and Paul would
[43:38] talk about this life that he lived and
[43:40] he would say for the law having a shadow
[43:42] of good things to come so the law was
[43:44] always pointing to something greater
[43:46] that would come later and that's why we
[43:48] preach in types and shadows out of the
[43:49] Old Testament but it's never perfect
[43:51] it's always pointing to something that's
[43:53] coming down the road and it's the full
[43:55] manifestation of what God intends he
[43:57] says the law having a shadow of good
[43:59] things to come and not the very image of
[44:01] things so the law was never the answer
[44:04] the law was never the answer and yet
[44:05] that's what the priesthood was relying
[44:07] on when Christ came was that the law
[44:09] would somehow make them acceptable
[44:12] before God but it was never meant to
[44:14] amen it was a shadow of the answer he
[44:16] says it was not the very image of the
[44:17] things so it can never with those
[44:19] sacrifices which they offered year by
[44:21] year continually make the comers there
[44:24] unto perfect so no matter how closely
[44:25] they followed the law how perfectly they
[44:27] did their sacrifices it could never
[44:29] perfect them it could only meet God's
[44:32] requirement it could not satisfy it it
[44:34] says for them would they not have ceased
[44:36] to be offered because that the
[44:37] worshippers once purged should have had
[44:40] no more conscience of sin amen CU under
[44:42] the law their sacrifices could never
[44:44] change the
[44:45] worshipper amen Works will never change
[44:48] you good works will never change you
[44:50] there has to be something done there has
[44:52] to be a purging they came in a sinner
[44:54] they went out a sinner the only
[44:56] difference was they went out covered by
[44:57] the blood amen but they went out of
[44:59] Sinner and that conscience could still
[45:01] bother them it says but in those
[45:02] sacrifices there's a remembrance again
[45:04] made of sins every year so the same
[45:06] question kept popping up every year it
[45:08] was never satisfied fully he says for it
[45:11] is not possible that the blood of bulls
[45:13] and of goats should take away sins that
[45:15] means there was another type of blood
[45:17] needed amen the blood the life of the
[45:19] blood of a bull or a goat can't come in
[45:21] and and and live in US it has to be the
[45:23] blood or or of a of a human so it says
[45:26] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[45:28] he saith sacrificed and offering thou
[45:30] wouldest not but a body hast thou
[45:33] prepared me there was lots of body
[45:35] sacrifice but it was the bodies of
[45:37] animals amen but Christ now when he
[45:39] comes he says you didn't want sacrifices
[45:41] of bulls and goats you wanted a
[45:44] fulfillment of the requirement you
[45:47] wanted an end to this you didn't want
[45:48] this endless chain of bowls and goats
[45:50] and Lambs being slain you wanted that to
[45:52] end you wanted it to be fulfilled in the
[45:54] law so that what we could come back into
[45:58] relationship that's what he wanted out
[45:59] of all this amen so the blood of bulls
[46:02] and goats didn't please God it just
[46:04] appeased him it satisfied the
[46:06] requirement that for sin there had to be
[46:08] death and so that's what was happening
[46:10] and there was this endless cycle over
[46:12] and over again and it was not doing
[46:13] anybody any good but it was holding off
[46:15] the wrath of God until God could come
[46:18] down and for and really uh put the Plan
[46:20] of Redemption into action amen and it
[46:22] would take God himself to do that living
[46:24] through Christ brother Brown would say
[46:26] it this way he said says and God being
[46:29] manifested in the flesh with Christ
[46:31] Jesus the anointed he says wrapped
[46:34] himself in a blood cell in the womb of
[46:37] Mary wrapped himself he says brought
[46:40] forth his life he lived a man he died a
[46:43] man to give his blood that through his
[46:45] body and the shedding of his blood that
[46:47] every believer could be wrapped in that
[46:49] blood cell with him so that was a body
[46:53] created by God for a purpose and it was
[46:55] to replace all the old sacrifices all
[46:58] the laws and to sacrifice that sin with
[47:00] one offering once and for all amen it
[47:03] would be a total work it would be a
[47:04] complete work it would be a finished
[47:06] work when that was done the sin question
[47:09] would be settled forever and we didn't
[47:10] have to worry about it once that was
[47:12] finished amen God prepared a way to
[47:15] satisfy his own requirement and that
[47:17] meant himself coming down it was none
[47:20] other than God himself coming down amen
[47:22] and then he would sacrifice that flesh
[47:24] body that Humanity to pay the price for
[47:26] our sins so Paul would continue and he'd
[47:29] say in burnt offerings and sacrifices
[47:31] for sin thou Hast no pleasure then said
[47:34] I who Christ lo I come in the volume of
[47:38] the book it's written of me to do thy
[47:40] will oh God we'll see this as we go that
[47:42] Jesus as a man his only purpose was to
[47:45] do God's
[47:47] will how did he know God's will there
[47:49] was a book written about it anden he
[47:52] didn't have to wonder what the will of
[47:54] God was for that flesh body because
[47:56] there was was a word written he says I'm
[47:58] coming in the volume of the book in
[48:00] other words what's written about me is
[48:01] what I'm coming to do church we have the
[48:03] same book written about us do you
[48:05] recognize that we're here to fulfill it
[48:07] and we're here to fulfill a a bride that
[48:10] can live a life that is above reproach
[48:12] by the holy spirit that can take a
[48:14] resurrection that can take a Rapture
[48:16] that's our part to fulfill but it's
[48:18] going to take nothing less than what
[48:20] Christ himself had which is God living
[48:22] in us to fulfill that word amen it's the
[48:25] same process amen every child of God is
[48:28] here for a purpose and you got a work to
[48:30] do while you're here and then there's
[48:32] going to come a point where God takes
[48:33] you off the scene by Resurrection or
[48:35] Rapture whatever it might be and until
[48:37] you get to that point nothing can take
[48:39] you away God's got a purpose here amen
[48:41] and sometimes you find you've been doing
[48:43] God's Will and God's purpose all along
[48:45] and you didn't realize that remember
[48:47] when we talked about adoption where
[48:49] brother B says he's try he wants to
[48:50] adopt mechanics and Housewives and
[48:53] farmers and this and that and what you
[48:55] have to realize is that when you step
[48:57] into God's will there's nothing can hold
[48:59] you back you can be satisfied you can be
[49:02] content you can speak with authority you
[49:05] can be in expectation because you're
[49:07] walking in his will and it's so simple
[49:10] sometimes we can't all be Apostles we
[49:13] can't all be ministers we can't all be
[49:15] uh people walking around doing signs and
[49:17] wonders but we have the sign and wonder
[49:19] of a life lived by the will of God
[49:21] according to the Holy Spirit that's the
[49:23] testimony of every true child of God is
[49:25] they have found their Kingdom Purpose
[49:27] and they walk in it and God is with them
[49:29] and God backs them up because they're
[49:31] walking in his word it's so simple it's
[49:33] so simple but we have what we have to do
[49:35] is find that purpose that's really what
[49:37] adoption is about is God bringing you to
[49:39] your purpose to your place and then you
[49:41] start to walk in it and you realize that
[49:43] every promise in the book is mine and
[49:46] you're able to walk and live in those
[49:47] things amen and so that changes your
[49:49] attitude it changes your approach I've
[49:51] said many times that before I came to
[49:53] the ministry really before we came to
[49:55] the ministry yes we lived Christian Life
[49:57] yes we had the Holy Ghost but we thought
[49:59] there had to be more to
[50:01] life that doesn't mean you have to think
[50:03] there's more to life but we knew there
[50:05] had to be something more because there
[50:07] was something that was still pulling us
[50:08] and C calling us and as soon as I
[50:11] stepped into ministry as simple as it
[50:13] was that's where our contentment was
[50:16] because we had stepped into God's will
[50:18] for the kingdom for me for me and my
[50:20] wife and from there everything just
[50:22] rolls off and so it's not that it's
[50:24] easy it's not easy to walk in his will
[50:27] but there's a peace and a rest and a
[50:29] contentment that comes with knowing that
[50:31] you've done what he wants you to do amen
[50:33] and that's what carries us through day
[50:35] by day he says above when he said
[50:37] sacrifice and offering and burnt
[50:39] offerings and offering for sin thou
[50:41] wouldest not neither has pleasure
[50:43] therein which are offered by the law
[50:45] then said he lo I come to do what thy
[50:48] will oh God he taketh away the first
[50:51] that he may establish the second what he
[50:53] takes away the first Covenant the law
[50:55] and he replaces it with a new New
[50:56] Covenant he says by the which we are all
[50:59] what by that New Covenant we are all
[51:01] Sanctified through the offering of the
[51:04] body of Jesus Christ once and for all a
[51:07] body hast thou prepared for me a body
[51:09] for what sacrifice to reconcile us back
[51:12] to God Amen Perfection was God's
[51:14] requirement and there's only one thing
[51:16] perfect church and that's God Amen so he
[51:18] put himself into flesh this body this
[51:21] life of Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth
[51:24] came from God himself and we see church
[51:26] that when God makes a provision it's
[51:28] always perfect it's always perfect we
[51:30] may not recognize it sometimes we don't
[51:33] like the way it comes or the way it goes
[51:35] but it was perfect when it came 2,000
[51:37] years ago at Calvary and that means it's
[51:39] perfect today whatever your need is God
[51:41] has already made a provision for it and
[51:43] it is perfect the timing is perfect the
[51:47] result is perfect amen you don't have to
[51:49] sit there and wonder is God going to do
[51:51] a good job God has already declared his
[51:54] Works to be perfect and all we're in is
[51:56] this little blip of time here waiting
[51:58] for him to do what he promised to do and
[52:00] he'll do it perfectly it'll do exactly
[52:02] what God intended amen I want to
[52:05] encourage you tonight whatever your need
[52:06] is God will do it perfectly according to
[52:09] what is best for you amen now we read
[52:13] last service that Jesus had learned
[52:15] obedience by the things he suffered and
[52:17] we know that he was born without sin and
[52:20] he had that nature of God in him but yet
[52:22] he had to make a choice every single day
[52:26] when that when that scantily CLA woman
[52:28] walked by he had to decide whether he
[52:30] was going to look or turn his head away
[52:32] when they rejected him because of his
[52:34] his weird birth or because he was
[52:35] supposedly illegitimate he had decide
[52:37] would he lash out would he beat him up
[52:39] or would he just turn the other cheek
[52:41] and then when he was rejected when when
[52:43] he he had the these these times in this
[52:46] world the scripture says he was tempted
[52:47] in every way like we are yet without sin
[52:50] every time he came to that for 30 years
[52:53] of his life he had to make a choice of
[52:55] his own free will no anointing no God
[52:59] dwelling in him he's just a Son of God
[53:01] like Adam was amen he was the image of
[53:04] God just like Adam was but he acted as
[53:07] God would because what he's the literal
[53:10] DNA of God you know we have that saying
[53:12] what do we call it um you know your kids
[53:14] will do something they say you know uh
[53:16] maybe uh uh one of my boys would do
[53:18] something you say John he's a spit image
[53:20] of you Jesus was the spitting image of
[53:22] God if we wanted to put it that way he
[53:25] acted the way God would act
[53:27] he talked the way God would T talk he
[53:29] reacted the way God would react amen he
[53:32] always did the thing perfectly but as a
[53:34] baby as a as a as a young boy as a
[53:38] teenager and even as an adult until he
[53:40] had his Jordan experience he was not
[53:43] God he was a Son of God he was a he he
[53:46] was a DNA of God and flesh he reflected
[53:49] God he was the image but he was 100%
[53:51] human just without the sinful nature
[53:54] that you and I are are are born with and
[53:56] so his every response was Godly cuz
[53:58] that's what he was he was God in flesh
[54:00] he was built the way God would be built
[54:03] and so he lived sinlessly 100% human yet
[54:06] without the spirit of God inside of him
[54:09] perfectly for 30 years tested tried put
[54:12] in hard times he got tired he got weary
[54:15] he got sick whatever it might be he
[54:17] dealt with people making fun of him and
[54:18] yet in all of that he never put a foot
[54:21] wrong mentally or externally he never
[54:24] had a wrong thought never had a wrong
[54:26] attitude ude never had a rude remark
[54:29] come inside but then he bit his lip
[54:31] everything he did was the way God would
[54:32] do it in all of his Temptations the
[54:34] scripture says he did it without sinning
[54:36] and he lived a perfect life and we see
[54:38] that God comes down in Jordan and he
[54:40] confirms it that 30 Years of Living
[54:43] Jesus never put a foot wrong and we see
[54:45] in Matthew 3 it says then cometh Jesus
[54:47] From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be
[54:50] baptized of him but John forbad him
[54:52] saying I have need to be baptized of
[54:54] thee and comest out of me and Jesus
[54:57] answering said unto him suffer for it to
[54:59] be so now for thus it becometh us to
[55:02] fulfill all righteousness then he
[55:04] suffered him he said just allow it John
[55:06] just do it and so John did it it says
[55:08] and Jesus when he was baptized went up
[55:10] straightway out of the water and lo the
[55:13] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[55:15] the spirit of God descending like a dove
[55:18] and lighting upon him and a voice from
[55:21] Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[55:24] whom I am well pleased so up to this
[55:27] point Jesus has been the perfect imprint
[55:29] the perfect image of God the exact image
[55:31] of God when you saw him as a baby that
[55:33] was what God would look like when you
[55:35] saw him as a teenager that was what God
[55:37] would look like but until God came down
[55:39] and anointed him he could not be
[55:42] activated for Ministry he was just like
[55:44] you or I he needed God to come down and
[55:47] dwell inside of him and God did that by
[55:49] confirming the Perfection of Jesus he
[55:51] said I am pleased in him this is my
[55:53] beloved Son this is my begotten son I've
[55:56] created this flesh and he has lived
[55:59] perfectly before me amen we said last
[56:02] service how how that translation is not
[56:04] just in whom I'm pleased but in who in
[56:07] whom I'm pleased to dwell in amen God
[56:11] said I'm pleased to dwell within this
[56:13] body God confirmed that this was his
[56:15] created son that perfect human body the
[56:18] man Jesus of Nazareth and then God now
[56:20] steps into that body that's what happens
[56:23] at Jordan amen now there's a supposed
[56:25] issue of here because the trinitarians
[56:28] will say well here you have the perfect
[56:30] uh point that there's three persons of
[56:31] the godhead you have a voice speaking
[56:33] from Heaven God the Father you have God
[56:35] the Holy Spirit coming down as a dove
[56:37] and then you have Jesus sitting there or
[56:38] standing there as the Son of God Amen so
[56:41] they'll say that's three distinct
[56:42] persons three distinct bodies amen but
[56:45] we've already covered the scriptures
[56:46] that says God's a spirit and God is holy
[56:49] God is the holy spirit that is the
[56:50] literal description of God himself so
[56:53] those two are one amen so it's God
[56:55] himself self coming down which means
[56:57] that God must be able to both speak from
[56:59] heaven and appear in their
[57:01] midst remember John saw the spirit of
[57:04] God coming down it was God himself
[57:07] coming to live inside the body of Jesus
[57:09] of Nazareth and we spoke many services
[57:11] ago how God is not limited by physical
[57:13] laws amen he can speak from Heaven while
[57:16] sitting right next to you
[57:19] today absolutely he can do it church I
[57:22] can do that by technology
[57:26] if I can do it by technology then how
[57:28] can we say God can't do that that God
[57:29] can't speak from here and be here but
[57:33] it's not that he's not there and he's
[57:34] down here he's in both places at one
[57:36] time we'll cover that in a second amen
[57:38] but God think of it this way can God
[57:41] speak to you and speak to you
[57:44] simultaneously saying something
[57:45] different absolutely he can you can be
[57:49] home and praying and God can say
[57:52] something to sister Amber and brother
[57:53] Mark could be at his home praying and
[57:54] God can speak something to him at the
[57:56] exact same time that he's speaking to
[57:58] sister Amber he's got two complete
[58:01] conversations happening
[58:03] simultaneously how does that work that's
[58:05] outside of our laws isn't it I can't
[58:08] have two conversations simultaneously I
[58:10] can only speak one word at a time God
[58:12] can be speaking to hundreds or thousands
[58:14] of people you know I've thought about it
[58:15] this way on a Sunday morning how many
[58:17] church services are going
[58:19] on how many men is God speaking
[58:23] through well he's only one well if he's
[58:26] there's only three there should only be
[58:27] three places where God can be
[58:29] simultaneously but that's not the way it
[58:31] works amen why because God is outside of
[58:34] space and time and all he's doing is
[58:36] he's interacting through this but he's
[58:38] not limited the way that we are in these
[58:40] things space and time and matter doesn't
[58:42] exist outside of God it exists within
[58:45] God God's not inside it it's all inside
[58:47] of him
[58:49] amen the Holy Spirit can literally be in
[58:51] you and me simultaneously he better be
[58:54] and yet it does not diminish God one bit
[58:57] at all that's not the way God works he's
[58:59] not limited he's a spirit amen so we can
[59:02] see this apparent separation of of Jesus
[59:05] of Nazareth the man and then the spirit
[59:07] coming down there you see two and that
[59:10] works but that two now becomes one
[59:12] because the spirit of God enters into
[59:13] the man Jesus of Nazareth and what does
[59:15] it produce Jesus the Christ Jesus the
[59:18] anointed one that's what happens there
[59:21] but we look in the scriptures and and
[59:23] just to teach a little bit this morning
[59:24] and I hope it's okay I know some people
[59:26] really like preaching and some people
[59:28] like teaching we're going to be teaching
[59:29] tonight but in John 17 this is Jesus now
[59:32] in the garden he says these words spake
[59:34] Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven
[59:37] and said father the hour is come glorify
[59:40] thy son that thy son may also glorify
[59:42] thee now he's lifting up his eyes and
[59:44] he's praying to Heaven question is
[59:46] couldn't he just look in the mirror well
[59:48] he could have there wasn't One In The
[59:49] Garden of Gethsemane but he's not he the
[59:52] point is that God can be everywhere and
[59:55] still be in Christ Christ he is not
[59:57] limited the fullness of God in flesh is
[59:59] in Christ amen but God is omniscient
[1:00:02] he's omnipresent he's all knowing all of
[1:00:04] these things he's not limited to there
[1:00:06] but his his dwelling place is Christ his
[1:00:09] dwelling place is Christ his revealing
[1:00:11] is Christ Paul would say this speaking
[1:00:13] of God he says for in him we live and
[1:00:16] move and have our being as certain also
[1:00:19] of your own pots have said for we are
[1:00:21] also his offspring his children he says
[1:00:23] in him we live we move and have our
[1:00:25] being so the whole universe is contained
[1:00:28] in
[1:00:29] God God is outside of it and the
[1:00:32] universe is here in front of him and he
[1:00:34] can come in and out of it and interact
[1:00:35] with it but it does not contain him
[1:00:37] rather he contains it amen God's bigger
[1:00:40] than all of these things Solomon puts it
[1:00:43] this way and Solomon had a wonderful way
[1:00:45] with words he says and they had built
[1:00:47] the temple remember they were building
[1:00:48] the Temple and Solomon says will God in
[1:00:51] very deed dwell with men on the earth he
[1:00:53] says is God going to come down and dwell
[1:00:54] in this Temple behold Heaven and the
[1:00:57] heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee in
[1:01:00] other words the solar system around us
[1:01:02] and the solar system outside of our
[1:01:03] solar system all of that the greatness
[1:01:06] of it the size of it the vastness of it
[1:01:08] still cannot contain God and then he
[1:01:11] says how much less this house was have
[1:01:13] built the point is not that God can't be
[1:01:16] all of those all of those places it's
[1:01:17] that he can dwell wherever he wants to
[1:01:20] and so he came down and he dwelt in a
[1:01:22] temple and he told him if you'll turn
[1:01:24] and you'll look towards that Temple I'll
[1:01:26] here cuz I'm dwelling there my shakina
[1:01:28] glory is there that's where I've
[1:01:29] identified my Dwelling Place was in that
[1:01:32] temple in the pillar of fire in that
[1:01:34] inside the holy of holies so God
[1:01:36] declares where he is and yet he is
[1:01:39] everywhere he dwells outside of all of
[1:01:42] these different places so God is that
[1:01:44] Creator God is our father the holy
[1:01:46] spirit amen and yet he dwelt in Christ
[1:01:48] and his indwelling presence in Christ
[1:01:50] made him the revelation of God to us
[1:01:52] that was God revealed to the people amen
[1:01:55] like I've said for Jesus Is God to us
[1:01:57] that's the revealing of God and not that
[1:01:59] man but it's the whole revealing of
[1:02:02] Jesus Christ shows the revealing of God
[1:02:04] himself that's where God has hidden
[1:02:05] himself and it's where God makes himself
[1:02:07] plain amen that's the name that God has
[1:02:10] received the name of God to us is the
[1:02:13] Lord Jesus Christ that is the only name
[1:02:15] we have for him he's going to have a new
[1:02:17] name later the Bible says but for now
[1:02:19] his only name is through Christ Jesus
[1:02:22] Christ that is the name of our God and
[1:02:25] savior amen and God even received
[1:02:27] worship through Jesus and he continues
[1:02:29] to do it today amen that is where God
[1:02:32] identified his Dwelling Place identified
[1:02:35] himself Paul said in Colossians he says
[1:02:37] as you have therefore received Christ
[1:02:39] Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted
[1:02:42] and built up in him and established in
[1:02:44] the faith as ye have been taught
[1:02:46] abounding therein with Thanksgiving he
[1:02:48] says beware lest any man spoil you
[1:02:51] through philosophy and vain deceit after
[1:02:53] the tradition of men after the rudiments
[1:02:56] of the world and not after Christ for
[1:02:58] what in him in Christ dwelleth all the
[1:03:02] fullness of the godhead bodily so
[1:03:06] everything that is in God is inside of
[1:03:09] Christ is revealed inside of Christ amen
[1:03:11] what is the godhead church as we said
[1:03:13] last service it is not the plurality of
[1:03:15] God it is the revealing of God in his
[1:03:18] different forms and ways amen it's not
[1:03:21] three Gods it's the revealing of God in
[1:03:23] three different
[1:03:24] manifestations so it's says that Christ
[1:03:26] in him dwells all the fullness of the
[1:03:28] godhead bodily so we see in Jesus Christ
[1:03:31] everything that God is and even when he
[1:03:33] walk this Earth we saw it in his purpose
[1:03:36] Redeemer and savior mighty God
[1:03:39] Everlasting father that's all in him we
[1:03:41] see it in his authority he was a
[1:03:43] deliverer he was a Healer he did
[1:03:45] Supernatural Works amongst the people we
[1:03:47] see it in his power he would raise the
[1:03:50] dead he would speak to Nature and it
[1:03:51] would obey him he could turn water into
[1:03:53] wine he could speak a coin into
[1:03:55] existence in the mouth of a fish great
[1:03:58] power great Authority and then we see it
[1:04:00] in his speech where all he could say is
[1:04:02] it is written it is written it is
[1:04:04] written he stayed with the word because
[1:04:06] that is what God has identified in amen
[1:04:09] we see Jesus come and he speaks to the
[1:04:11] spiritual world and he's talking with
[1:04:15] demons nobody else talked with demons
[1:04:18] before they might lay hands on them they
[1:04:21] might they might have prayed for them
[1:04:22] and they got better but nobody talked to
[1:04:25] Demons before and yet he comes and he's
[1:04:27] having a conversation with the
[1:04:28] supernatural that nobody can see why
[1:04:30] because God dwelling in him can contact
[1:04:32] that amen and what was it it was him
[1:04:35] showing the God above us and yet he's
[1:04:38] there and we see him comforting people
[1:04:39] showing Mercy to people healing people
[1:04:42] uh going to wedding ceremonies with
[1:04:44] people and he's showing what god with us
[1:04:47] and then we see him pointing forward to
[1:04:49] the day when the comforter would come
[1:04:50] the Holy Spirit and Christ said it's me
[1:04:52] myself coming back and that's him
[1:04:54] showing God in us God above us God With
[1:04:57] Us God in us and it's all bundled up in
[1:04:59] that one in that one body right there
[1:05:01] amen it's all the revealing it's the
[1:05:03] entire revelation of God the fullness of
[1:05:05] God is revealed in Jesus Christ not the
[1:05:08] man Jesus of Nazareth in Jesus Christ
[1:05:12] amen the man Jesus was pleasing to God
[1:05:14] and God dwelt inside that man after
[1:05:16] Jordan and from that moment God became
[1:05:19] literal flesh in fullness anden he was
[1:05:23] the DNA he was the nature but now the
[1:05:25] very person the very God himself in
[1:05:28] spirit form came and dwelt in that body
[1:05:30] and it what was it it was Heaven and
[1:05:31] Earth uniting together and that's the
[1:05:34] Perfection of uni of unity is When
[1:05:36] Heaven and Earth join together amen
[1:05:38] there Jesus of Nazareth became Jesus the
[1:05:41] Christ Jesus the anointed one the Mighty
[1:05:44] God and so we can understand that quote
[1:05:46] that we finished with last service where
[1:05:48] brother B would say when Jesus a
[1:05:50] carpenter's son physically speaking when
[1:05:52] he came to the Earth here that's all he
[1:05:54] was known of and the day that John
[1:05:56] baptized him God Vindicated him he says
[1:06:00] God spoke from the heavens John saw him
[1:06:02] coming in the form of the dove and said
[1:06:04] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:06:06] pleased to dwell he says the right
[1:06:08] translation there is in whom I'm pleased
[1:06:10] to dwell in he says Jesus immediately
[1:06:13] Anointed with God this is the person the
[1:06:17] presence of God Almighty coming down he
[1:06:20] was an he was anointing that and he says
[1:06:22] he was just a man till that time but now
[1:06:25] now he becomes the God man he said
[1:06:28] someone was telling me here not long ago
[1:06:30] that he was just a prophet he was a good
[1:06:32] man he says he was more than that he was
[1:06:34] the Anointed God the Bible said God was
[1:06:37] in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:06:39] himself God in Christ he says notice it
[1:06:43] how beautiful the father speaking from
[1:06:46] the heavens when he was obedient to
[1:06:47] baptism said this is my beloved Son in
[1:06:50] whom I'm pleased to dwell in no wonder
[1:06:52] Jesus could say all the power in heavens
[1:06:55] and earth
[1:06:56] as given into my
[1:06:58] hands but we have to see the perfection
[1:07:01] in this Unity because this is the
[1:07:02] firstborn among many Brethren it's the
[1:07:04] first of many children that are coming
[1:07:06] amen and so now we have a body that is
[1:07:10] subject to the person living inside
[1:07:13] that's what we see in Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:15] this body has a mind it has a nature it
[1:07:17] has a will of its own and yes it's Godly
[1:07:20] but it still has a certain element of
[1:07:21] self-preservation Amen we see it in the
[1:07:24] Garden of Gethsemane where Jes Jesus is
[1:07:26] praying and he know his time he knows
[1:07:28] his time is short cuz remember what
[1:07:29] happened on Mount Transfiguration was he
[1:07:31] got positioned now as what mediator and
[1:07:36] so they told him all that was going to
[1:07:37] happen remember Elijah and Moses are
[1:07:39] there and they're telling him what's
[1:07:40] going to happen in Jerusalem and as soon
[1:07:42] as Jesus leaves there he turns his face
[1:07:44] and he steps now into his adoption role
[1:07:46] and it's to be the mediator the full
[1:07:48] Redeemer for for fallen Humanity but he
[1:07:51] comes to the Garden of Gethsemane and he
[1:07:53] knows what's got to happen he knows got
[1:07:55] to die he knows he's got to be beaten
[1:07:58] and whipped more badly than anybody has
[1:08:00] ever been beaten or whipped in their
[1:08:01] life he knows that he knows the
[1:08:04] scriptures he knows the word he is the
[1:08:06] word and he knows he's got to fulfill it
[1:08:08] and so Jesus there is praying and he
[1:08:11] says if it be possible don't make me do
[1:08:16] this he has a personal will that flesh
[1:08:20] has a will that says I do not want to do
[1:08:22] this but every time he says it he says
[1:08:26] but
[1:08:27] nevertheless nevertheless not my will
[1:08:30] but thine be done so you see that body
[1:08:34] has a will and it's what it doesn't want
[1:08:36] to go through pain none of us wants to
[1:08:38] go through hard times Church none of us
[1:08:41] wants to go through pain but Jesus had
[1:08:43] to go through with it but he had to
[1:08:45] choose of his own free will that man had
[1:08:48] to choose of his own free will I will
[1:08:51] lay down my life because a lamb never
[1:08:55] got to choose a goat and a bull never
[1:08:57] got to choose but for the perfect
[1:08:59] sacrifice it had to be perfectly
[1:09:01] identified by God as sinless but it had
[1:09:04] to give its life of its own free will
[1:09:06] and God never told that man Jesus you've
[1:09:09] got to do it Jesus had to surrender his
[1:09:12] own will to the God within him and say
[1:09:14] I'll do whatever you want me to do and
[1:09:17] he did amen that's 100% man there not
[1:09:20] wanting to go through with it but
[1:09:21] there's 100% God there that says I'll
[1:09:23] fulfill your word CU he is the word
[1:09:27] amen but as soon as God steps into that
[1:09:30] body on the River Jordan Jesus that man
[1:09:33] becomes wholly subject to that God that
[1:09:35] is within him see you got to understand
[1:09:37] Church it wasn't just about living a
[1:09:39] perfect life he had done that for 30
[1:09:42] years that tells me today you can't just
[1:09:45] be about living a perfect life amen it
[1:09:48] was never about not doing the wrong
[1:09:50] thing it was never about just doing the
[1:09:53] right things amen but rather it was was
[1:09:55] about living his purpose by the word of
[1:09:58] God that's what it was all about amen we
[1:10:00] read it says I come to do thy will what
[1:10:03] in the volume of the book it's written
[1:10:05] of me he came to fulfill what the word
[1:10:07] said Messiah would do amen we can focus
[1:10:11] so much on our Christian performance
[1:10:13] sometimes amen of not doing the wrong
[1:10:15] things and and doing the right things
[1:10:17] and and that's not the only reason we're
[1:10:19] here we ought to do the right things we
[1:10:20] ought to make good decisions we ought to
[1:10:22] have a a life that is visibly Christian
[1:10:24] amen we ought to keep our lives
[1:10:26] Sanctified I was reading the other
[1:10:28] morning in my personal devotions in
[1:10:30] Titus where Paul said this is a faithful
[1:10:32] saying and these things I will that thou
[1:10:35] affirm constantly that they which have
[1:10:37] believed in God might be careful to
[1:10:39] maintain good
[1:10:41] works we got to live a good life we've
[1:10:44] got to make right decisions we've got to
[1:10:46] be a testimony by those things he says
[1:10:48] these things are good and profitable
[1:10:50] unto men they're not just for us they're
[1:10:52] for those around us to see how you can
[1:10:55] Prosper as a believer I'm not talking
[1:10:58] about money I'm talking about how you
[1:11:00] can have a life of peace and rest where
[1:11:04] things just work out even when they
[1:11:06] aren't good amen that people can see how
[1:11:09] we can go through life and we don't need
[1:11:11] everything they need we don't have the
[1:11:12] dependencies that they have and we don't
[1:11:14] make decisions the way that they make
[1:11:16] amen that they can see that we do things
[1:11:18] differently amen that's part of our
[1:11:20] Christian Duty and it's part of our
[1:11:22] testimony but that's not all there is to
[1:11:24] being a Christian
[1:11:26] remember what the definition of a child
[1:11:28] of God is it says for as many as are
[1:11:31] what as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:11:34] God they are the sons of God Amen
[1:11:37] there's a surrender to our own will like
[1:11:39] Christ had to the to God Amen and it's
[1:11:42] our surrender to the holy spirit that we
[1:11:44] can be led by him that distinguishes us
[1:11:46] from everybody else church you can go
[1:11:49] out in this world and you can find
[1:11:51] people living a life where according to
[1:11:53] what they believe you can't lay a finger
[1:11:55] finger on them there are people live a
[1:11:57] cleaner life than what we do based on
[1:12:00] what they know they live closer to what
[1:12:01] they know than we live to what we know
[1:12:03] you don't believe me your Prophet said
[1:12:06] it there are Catholics that live closer
[1:12:08] to Catholic Doctrine than we do with a
[1:12:10] fully open
[1:12:12] word that's in
[1:12:14] sincerity they're wrong but they're
[1:12:16] sincere but you can find people that are
[1:12:18] living a perfect life and they're
[1:12:20] sincere and they're committed but that
[1:12:22] is not all that God expects God expects
[1:12:25] surrender and that's surrender to be led
[1:12:29] not just dos and don'ts make the right
[1:12:31] decision make the wrong decision but go
[1:12:33] when he says go stay when he says stay
[1:12:36] speak when he says speak shut up when he
[1:12:38] says shut up anden that's what we saw in
[1:12:41] the book of Acts was a people a church
[1:12:43] that was led by the Holy Spirit not led
[1:12:46] by their own whims not led by Ministry
[1:12:48] led by the Holy Spirit as individuals
[1:12:51] day by day amen that is the
[1:12:53] identification of a believer they can be
[1:12:55] led by the spirit of God and to be led
[1:12:58] by the dove you've got to have the
[1:12:59] nature of a lamb and that is surrendered
[1:13:02] not my will thine be done amen God surre
[1:13:06] God expects that surrendered life amen
[1:13:08] and we must surrender our will to allow
[1:13:11] him to act through US amen Jesus lived a
[1:13:14] perfect life for 30 years but it wasn't
[1:13:18] until the spirit of God came in him that
[1:13:19] he started doing something with that
[1:13:21] perfect life we can sit on a couch I
[1:13:24] said it many times before we can read
[1:13:25] our Bible every day and and not look at
[1:13:27] anything bad and not get angry with
[1:13:29] people and not and that's all good but
[1:13:31] that's not why God created us God
[1:13:33] created us to go out and be in the world
[1:13:35] and not of the world that people could
[1:13:37] see us be able to walk through it and
[1:13:38] not be affected by it amen and that we
[1:13:41] could we could do what God would have us
[1:13:43] to do we sing that song Leave Me Lord I
[1:13:45] will follow leave me Lord I will go you
[1:13:48] have called me I will answer leave me
[1:13:50] Lord I will go do we mean it because
[1:13:52] that's what it's going to take to get
[1:13:53] out of here is a people that surrender
[1:13:55] to the holy spirit amen that's where you
[1:13:58] real Unity is it's not about Christian
[1:14:00] performance about dos and don'ts it's
[1:14:02] about can I follow the leading of the
[1:14:05] Holy Spirit every single day
[1:14:09] amen after Jordan The Experience there
[1:14:12] Jesus is full of God we would say amen
[1:14:14] he is Anointed God and as perfect as as
[1:14:18] he was that had to have been quite a
[1:14:19] moment you know as I was studying for
[1:14:21] this you know you think about that is
[1:14:24] the identified Dwelling Place of God the
[1:14:26] fullness of God dropping into human
[1:14:29] flesh I don't care how perfect was that
[1:14:31] must have been a a supernatural event
[1:14:34] you know in ministering there have been
[1:14:37] times and even sitting in the pews in
[1:14:39] other services there have been times
[1:14:41] where there was such an anointing I
[1:14:42] couldn't even stand
[1:14:44] up and that's only a portion of it
[1:14:48] imagine what it was when God himself
[1:14:50] came down and stepped into that body I
[1:14:53] can't imagine the feeling
[1:14:56] I can't imagine the change that happened
[1:14:58] there amen but I want you to see
[1:15:01] something because Jesus has proven over
[1:15:03] 30 years his character by obedience amen
[1:15:06] by obedience he suffered through many
[1:15:08] things yet never failed or Fallen but
[1:15:11] church he had never had power
[1:15:14] before and the first thing that happens
[1:15:16] as soon as he gets power is what has he
[1:15:19] done he's driven into the desert for
[1:15:22] testing because characters Pro D when
[1:15:25] you get power so we can sit here and say
[1:15:28] well I've got character I've got
[1:15:29] character but if you have no influence
[1:15:31] you have no money you have no Authority
[1:15:33] you have no reputation what's your
[1:15:35] character all about but the minute now
[1:15:38] you get power you get financial power
[1:15:42] you become a boss you become a manager
[1:15:45] you become wealthy you get a reputation
[1:15:48] you get a gift you get a Ministry now
[1:15:50] what are you going to do with it that's
[1:15:52] when you start to see is when you've got
[1:15:53] a chance to in for to take that power
[1:15:56] and use it for yourself that's when
[1:15:59] we're going to see if you've got
[1:16:00] character you want to see what somebody
[1:16:02] has really inside of them give them a
[1:16:03] lot of something or flip the switch and
[1:16:06] take it all away because that's what God
[1:16:08] will do so many times sometimes he'll
[1:16:10] give you something brother B I'm talk
[1:16:11] about he says God will give you a little
[1:16:12] gift to see what you do with it and then
[1:16:14] if you get all wound up in your mind I'm
[1:16:17] this I'm that and the other thing he
[1:16:18] says that's God will let you keep it but
[1:16:19] that's as far as you're going to go but
[1:16:22] if you can humble yourself and give the
[1:16:23] glory to God then God will keep giving
[1:16:25] and God will keep using in these
[1:16:26] different things but then what happens
[1:16:28] sometimes is God will take it all away
[1:16:30] and that's the other side of character
[1:16:32] characters proven usually in EXT
[1:16:33] extremes you either have an abundance or
[1:16:36] you have a big lack and what happens is
[1:16:38] God will put you in a financial burden
[1:16:41] in a hard time and what's he trying to
[1:16:43] see he's saying are you going to get
[1:16:44] away from your commitment to the body
[1:16:47] are you going to start chasing down jobs
[1:16:49] constantly are you going to forsake the
[1:16:50] Gathering of yourselves together are you
[1:16:53] going to go into Deb
[1:16:55] is your desperation going to drive you
[1:16:57] to God or is it going to drive you to
[1:16:59] man's way of solving these things amen
[1:17:02] God will let your
[1:17:04] healthful he let things get tough in
[1:17:06] your marriage just to see what are you
[1:17:08] going to do are you going to go to the
[1:17:10] word or are you going to go to your own
[1:17:12] flesh or go to the way that the world
[1:17:14] does these things amen that's when
[1:17:17] character shown is usually in those
[1:17:18] extreme things so Jesus now full of the
[1:17:21] Holy Ghost almighty God the fullness
[1:17:23] dwelling inside of him is driven in into
[1:17:25] the desert in two two portions of
[1:17:27] scripture it says he's LED and then in
[1:17:29] Luke it says he's driven he's driven
[1:17:31] into the desert the spirit of God inside
[1:17:33] him drives him into the desert and
[1:17:36] what's the question that he's got to
[1:17:37] answer will he use that power for his
[1:17:40] own
[1:17:42] purposes that's all God's trying to
[1:17:44] prove he's trying to prove will this
[1:17:46] will this body of Flesh stay subject to
[1:17:48] the word even when it has unlimited
[1:17:50] power because remember Jesus could speak
[1:17:52] it and it would happen that's what the
[1:17:54] prophets were remember when Elisha's
[1:17:56] there and they say go up thou bald head
[1:17:57] like your master and what does he do two
[1:18:00] bears come out God will obey a son of
[1:18:03] man he did it with Moses he did it with
[1:18:05] Elisha he'll do it with Jesus as well
[1:18:08] but what's he doing he's proving
[1:18:09] character will you use the power for
[1:18:11] your own gain rather than according to
[1:18:13] what the will of God is amen so Jesus
[1:18:16] has unlimited power here and the spirit
[1:18:18] of God drives him into the desert and
[1:18:20] the question that Satan's trying to get
[1:18:21] him to do or or the answer he's trying
[1:18:23] to get is prove to me you're the son of
[1:18:25] God you know we have lots of people say
[1:18:27] prove you're a Believer prove you're a
[1:18:30] Christian and they give you a task to
[1:18:32] perform Jesus never came to put on a
[1:18:35] show he never did it because people
[1:18:37] asked him to do it remember they came
[1:18:38] and they said we want a sign he gave
[1:18:41] them a ton of signs but he wouldn't give
[1:18:43] them the one they wanted because he's
[1:18:44] not going to answer to them that's not
[1:18:46] the way these things were amen but
[1:18:48] before if Jesus had been driven into the
[1:18:50] desert and and had to deal with Satan it
[1:18:52] wouldn't have mattered because he had no
[1:18:54] power then there was no anointing on him
[1:18:56] but now he's got unlimited power and he
[1:18:58] can use that at any time and so what
[1:19:00] does Jesus do Satan says you know you're
[1:19:03] hungry turn these stones into bread and
[1:19:05] he says it is written and he takes them
[1:19:07] up on top of the temple he says cast
[1:19:09] yourself down the angels will catch you
[1:19:10] and he says no no no it is also written
[1:19:13] it is written it is written and it is
[1:19:15] also written every time he came back at
[1:19:17] Satan he did not use power he showed
[1:19:20] where the real power was it's in the
[1:19:23] word god back backs up his word God
[1:19:25] doesn't back me up God doesn't back you
[1:19:27] up God backs his word up you step into
[1:19:29] his word and he's just backing up his
[1:19:31] word Time and Time Again Church you got
[1:19:33] a hard decision to make find your place
[1:19:35] in the word and God will back you up
[1:19:37] every time that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:19:40] he'll back his word up that's not me
[1:19:42] saying thus sayith the Lord I'm saying
[1:19:44] that's God's thus sayeth the Lord is the
[1:19:46] word when you step into that he cannot
[1:19:49] fail amen what a place we can find
[1:19:52] ourselves amen the word is our answer
[1:19:54] the word is always our answer we stay
[1:19:56] with that amen and that's what Jesus did
[1:19:59] and he comes back and Satan can't get
[1:20:00] him off that word it is written it is
[1:20:02] written it is written and after that
[1:20:04] Satan leaves and what does God do he
[1:20:06] brings Angels down to minister to him
[1:20:07] and he gives them everything he has need
[1:20:09] of everything he has need of but he had
[1:20:12] to stand there and not use that power
[1:20:13] for his own self and then and then and
[1:20:15] only then what does he do he comes down
[1:20:17] and he starts his ministry and the very
[1:20:19] first thing he preaches is Isaiah 61 he
[1:20:21] says the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:20:23] because the Lord OED me to preach Good
[1:20:25] Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to
[1:20:27] bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim
[1:20:29] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[1:20:31] of the prison to them that are bound
[1:20:34] he's not coming with power for himself
[1:20:35] he's coming with power for you he's
[1:20:36] coming with power for me the power is
[1:20:38] not for ourselves Church it is for the
[1:20:41] body amen it is for the Believers it's
[1:20:43] for the children of God there's not an
[1:20:45] ounce of selfishness there the scripture
[1:20:47] says Jesus was weary and yet he gives
[1:20:50] peace and strength to those that are
[1:20:51] weary but he cannot give it to himself
[1:20:53] he has to go through do things without
[1:20:55] the power of that for himself amen but
[1:20:59] he's not putting on a show he's coming
[1:21:00] down to do things for you and he's doing
[1:21:02] things for me with that power amen and
[1:21:05] you'll find that Jesus now that God
[1:21:07] Almighty is inside of him all he does is
[1:21:10] the will of God he doesn't speak unless
[1:21:12] God tells him to speak he doesn't move
[1:21:13] unless God tells him to move he doesn't
[1:21:15] heal unless God tells him to heal but
[1:21:17] when God tells him to do it that man
[1:21:19] goes and he does it time and time again
[1:21:21] and it's perfect every single time and
[1:21:23] sometimes he goes and he's he walks into
[1:21:25] a crowd of thousands and he heals
[1:21:26] everyone and then sometimes he walks but
[1:21:28] to the pool of Bethesda and he just
[1:21:29] takes one out of it it's whatever God
[1:21:32] shows him to do
[1:21:35] amen he could have done whatever he
[1:21:37] wanted but he bound his will to the God
[1:21:39] that was inside him this is after the
[1:21:43] the he talks to the woman at the well of
[1:21:45] Samaria it says Jesus said to his
[1:21:47] disciples my meat is to do the will of
[1:21:50] him that sent me and to finish his work
[1:21:52] the amplifi this is really a
[1:21:53] conglomeration
[1:21:55] Jesus said to them I am fed by doing the
[1:21:57] will of the one who sent me and by
[1:22:00] completing his work what his hunger his
[1:22:02] desire is Satisfied by doing the will of
[1:22:05] God I can say this by personal testimony
[1:22:08] when you step into the purpose of God
[1:22:11] for your life it'll be the greatest
[1:22:12] contentment you find money won't do it
[1:22:15] popularity won't do it influence won't
[1:22:17] do it men women won't do it women men
[1:22:19] won't do
[1:22:20] it you have to find your place and when
[1:22:23] you step into that it'll be a satisfying
[1:22:25] portion for you day by day if you can
[1:22:27] only keep your mind centered on this is
[1:22:29] what God wants for my life that's it you
[1:22:32] may be a business owner like some of our
[1:22:34] brothers here you might be an engineer
[1:22:36] you might be a housewife you might be a
[1:22:38] retired Elder whatever place you find
[1:22:41] yourself in if that's where God wants
[1:22:43] you to be there's contentment for it
[1:22:45] even as you go through those changing
[1:22:46] roles inside of your life amen so we see
[1:22:49] Christ here and he's all man and he's
[1:22:52] all God Amen he's not a second person of
[1:22:54] the trinity it's God revealing himself
[1:22:56] in human flesh and that body is no
[1:22:58] different to God than a pillar of fire
[1:23:00] it's just a body to him amen yes it's a
[1:23:03] human body it's born of a woman but
[1:23:05] there's not a lick a difference to God
[1:23:06] it's just another form that God is
[1:23:08] taking on it's another revealing of God
[1:23:11] Amen but watch how Jesus starts to talk
[1:23:13] now that he's got the indwelling god
[1:23:15] inside of him amen and we see this
[1:23:17] because we have to understand that what
[1:23:19] he's doing is what we're doing the way
[1:23:21] it worked with him is the way it works
[1:23:22] with us yes he's sinless with and he's
[1:23:25] got god without measure but the process
[1:23:27] is the same and the results ought to be
[1:23:28] the same amen but this body that body of
[1:23:31] flesh is speaking but it's not just him
[1:23:33] speaking there's a God that's speaking
[1:23:35] through him and and we see in John 8
[1:23:37] that the Pharisees and the priests are
[1:23:39] questioning Jesus and they're giving
[1:23:41] them a hard time and watch what Jesus
[1:23:43] says here he says Jesus answered if I
[1:23:46] honor myself my honor is nothing you
[1:23:48] want to find out if somebody's got the
[1:23:49] holy ghost look where they're putting
[1:23:50] the
[1:23:51] honor he says I'm not honoring myself
[1:23:54] I'm not trying to make a name for myself
[1:23:55] every time I do something I'm pointing
[1:23:57] back to the father I'm pointing back to
[1:23:59] the god that is within me he says it is
[1:24:01] my father that honth me of whom you say
[1:24:04] that he is your God now that seem see
[1:24:07] seems an odd thing to say if God's
[1:24:08] dwelling in him that there's a
[1:24:10] separation there but Jesus is showing
[1:24:12] that there's a body now in his time and
[1:24:15] there was a body before the body used to
[1:24:18] be a pillar of fire and they had no
[1:24:20] problem putting God in the pillar of
[1:24:21] fire but what's Jesus saying he's saying
[1:24:24] now God has honored me and there's a new
[1:24:26] body now and the body is me and God has
[1:24:29] changed his dwelling place and he's
[1:24:31] trying to show them the transition
[1:24:32] that's happening they cannot see it the
[1:24:35] amazing thing is that they believe that
[1:24:37] Messiah will be God in flesh and yet
[1:24:40] here comes one and says God is in flesh
[1:24:42] and they're like yeah no
[1:24:43] way he's fulfilling their very Doctrine
[1:24:46] their very belief and yet they can't
[1:24:48] accept it amen they could see God in a
[1:24:50] pillar of fire they could see him come
[1:24:51] down in the temple or the or the you
[1:24:53] know the T in the wilderness and these
[1:24:55] different things and they could see God
[1:24:57] there but now they see the God standing
[1:24:59] in flesh and they can't make the
[1:25:00] transition from a pillar of fire to A
[1:25:02] Man Called Jesus because the outer
[1:25:04] wrapping doesn't look like what they
[1:25:06] expected amen he's saying I'm the body
[1:25:10] God's inside of me I have the honor of
[1:25:12] God dwelling inside of me I'm God
[1:25:14] revealed to you he says yet ye have not
[1:25:17] known him but I know him and if I should
[1:25:19] say I know him not I shall be a liar
[1:25:21] like unto you Jesus was rough on the
[1:25:24] ministry boy he says but I know him and
[1:25:27] keep his say so this is Jesus now this
[1:25:29] is this is the flesh man he's speaking
[1:25:32] but watch now the switch we have to be
[1:25:34] so
[1:25:36] careful we can put too much on a man and
[1:25:38] we can miss the God and you can miss it
[1:25:40] in the son of man this in this day and
[1:25:42] age you can think that's just a man
[1:25:44] speaking but there's a time where God
[1:25:45] speaks out amen that's what the son of
[1:25:48] that's what we recognize in a son of man
[1:25:49] Ministry in this age is not that the man
[1:25:51] William brandham was Christ he was not
[1:25:53] Christ but boy oh boy Church there was a
[1:25:55] time where Christ stepped into that body
[1:25:57] and did the exact same works that he did
[1:25:59] 2,000 years ago and that revealed Christ
[1:26:01] to us not in that man that was just God
[1:26:04] coming down and using a body and then
[1:26:05] he'd step away again brother Brandon was
[1:26:07] not the Christ any more than you or I
[1:26:10] are but God would come down the very
[1:26:13] person of God and use that man and
[1:26:15] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:26:17] heart like he did at the well at Samaria
[1:26:19] like he did with Abraham on the plains
[1:26:20] of mamry and that was God himself coming
[1:26:22] down and using human flesh all over
[1:26:25] again that's the son of man Ministry
[1:26:28] amen watch what he says here your father
[1:26:31] Abraham Rejoice to see my
[1:26:34] day he says and he saw it and was glad
[1:26:38] now who's speaking here is this Jesus of
[1:26:40] Nazareth no no no this is the god inside
[1:26:42] of him because my day is always the day
[1:26:45] that the Lord fulfills his word that's
[1:26:48] what it is for us amen for Abraham the
[1:26:51] day of the Lord was him coming and
[1:26:52] saying you're going to have a son amen
[1:26:54] that was the day and God himself came to
[1:26:56] do us for us the day of the Lord is the
[1:26:58] resurrection and the Rapture and the day
[1:27:01] of the Lord for the rest of the world is
[1:27:03] what final judgment amen it's the day uh
[1:27:06] of Judgment at the end of the
[1:27:07] tribulation Jesus is saying here Abraham
[1:27:10] was so happy when he saw me and I told
[1:27:12] him he would have a
[1:27:13] son he says then said the Jews unto him
[1:27:16] Thou Art not yet 50 years old and hast
[1:27:18] thou seen Abraham Jesus said unto them
[1:27:20] verily verily I say unto you before
[1:27:22] Abraham was I am
[1:27:26] now was Jesus of Nazareth back before
[1:27:29] Abraham no this is a created body it was
[1:27:33] not Jesus of a Jesus of Nazareth that
[1:27:35] was walking the the road to to to
[1:27:37] Abraham on the plains of mamry and these
[1:27:39] different things but what he says here
[1:27:41] is I was there before Abraham who I am
[1:27:44] the self-existing one this is Jehovah
[1:27:46] God speaking now through him and Jesus
[1:27:49] says what before before Abraham was I
[1:27:52] was there before that
[1:27:55] who the Christ not Jesus of Nazareth
[1:27:58] Jesus the Christ the dwelling place of
[1:28:00] God Amen he was the visible God as the
[1:28:02] pillar of fire he was the dwelling place
[1:28:04] of God he was the image of God and
[1:28:06] brother BR would put it this way he says
[1:28:07] you've seen the picture of this Pillar
[1:28:09] of Fire that led the children of Israel
[1:28:11] when it was here on Earth when it was in
[1:28:13] the burning bush he says it was Christ
[1:28:17] what the dwelling place of God all Bible
[1:28:19] teachers know that when he was here on
[1:28:21] Earth he said before Abraham was I am
[1:28:24] the I am was in the burning bush he said
[1:28:26] I came from God I go to God now watch
[1:28:29] how he explain this he came in from a
[1:28:32] pillar of fire was made flesh and dwelt
[1:28:35] Among Us in the form of God's son the
[1:28:37] Christ died buried rose again and the
[1:28:41] same Pillar of Fire returned back under
[1:28:45] the name of Jesus the Holy Ghost he says
[1:28:48] on the road to Damascus Paul was struck
[1:28:50] down a light shining in his face and he
[1:28:53] said Saul why person cutest thou me and
[1:28:55] he said who are you Lord and he said I
[1:28:58] am Jesus it's not another person it's
[1:29:01] just the dwelling place of God that has
[1:29:03] changed it's where God hides himself and
[1:29:05] it's where God reveals himself to us
[1:29:07] he's
[1:29:08] revealed to everyone else he's hidden
[1:29:11] they can't see him amen he's hidden and
[1:29:13] it fools them every time because they're
[1:29:15] looking at the packaging instead of
[1:29:17] looking at how it Compares with what the
[1:29:19] word
[1:29:20] says amen remember what Jesus said he
[1:29:22] says if you can't believe me believe my
[1:29:24] works for there that's what the I'm
[1:29:26] doing what the word says I was going to
[1:29:28] do you can't get past the wrapping but
[1:29:30] just look at the works and they'll
[1:29:31] testify of
[1:29:33] me right that's what always fools people
[1:29:36] they like the results they don't like
[1:29:38] the package every single time and so
[1:29:41] they won't go all the way with God and
[1:29:43] that's where denominations are stuck is
[1:29:44] they might like the results but they
[1:29:46] don't like the package that comes with
[1:29:47] it he says but when he died and arose
[1:29:50] again and come up the Bible said no one
[1:29:52] has ascended up but he that that came
[1:29:54] down
[1:29:55] first amen when he was in heaven who
[1:29:58] Christ he was the logos that went out of
[1:30:01] God in the beginning and when he came
[1:30:03] down on Earth and was not made to be an
[1:30:05] angel he came down on Earth and took the
[1:30:07] form of a bondsman not an angel not come
[1:30:10] down in the great Jehovah Glory but he
[1:30:12] came down as a man to redeem man to die
[1:30:15] for man to die as a man he says he never
[1:30:18] died as God he died as a man the sin of
[1:30:21] man was upon the son of man and he had
[1:30:24] to become a man in order to pay the
[1:30:26] penalty amen so we have this picture
[1:30:29] that we had before of the pillar of fire
[1:30:31] and it was God in the pillar of fire
[1:30:33] that was the logos that came out of God
[1:30:35] remember that was the light that was
[1:30:36] created it was a pillar of light a
[1:30:38] pillar of fire and then God came in and
[1:30:40] dwelt personally in that Pillar of Fire
[1:30:42] and that was the Christ that was the
[1:30:44] anointed one that was the body that is
[1:30:46] the dwelling place of God and then that
[1:30:49] Pillar of Fire 2,000 years ago was set
[1:30:52] aside and so what happens if you watch
[1:30:54] the screen is that pillar fire is set
[1:30:56] aside and there's a different body now
[1:30:58] and that body is called Jesus of
[1:31:00] Nazareth and then God comes in and he
[1:31:02] dwells in it and that becomes Jesus
[1:31:04] Christ Jesus the anointed one amen and
[1:31:07] Jesus Christ is the new name the new
[1:31:10] Dwelling Place the new revelation of God
[1:31:13] that's what he is but God has just
[1:31:15] changed forms but now he's got a name
[1:31:18] before he was Jehovah it really had a
[1:31:21] name that was unpronouncable as we
[1:31:22] talked about it to make the name you
[1:31:24] know y ww however it is um you know
[1:31:29] Yahweh we would call it but you can't
[1:31:30] actually pronounce it and they say you
[1:31:32] do it by breathing in that's how you
[1:31:34] pronounce the name of God as he gave it
[1:31:36] to the to the to the Israelites to the
[1:31:38] Jews and so you could never pronounce it
[1:31:40] but now he comes down and because he's
[1:31:42] coming into Redemption he's a Kinsman he
[1:31:44] needs a name he needs an identity and
[1:31:47] his name is Jesus that is now the name
[1:31:50] of God and he is known by no other name
[1:31:52] until the word is completely fulfilled
[1:31:54] everything that he does now is through
[1:31:55] Jesus the Christ amen God chose that
[1:31:58] name not you not I not Mary not Joseph
[1:32:01] God said his name will be Jesus and God
[1:32:03] identified himself with that name that's
[1:32:05] why we baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:32:07] Christ because that is the name of the
[1:32:10] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost it is
[1:32:13] Jesus Christ amen that is the name of
[1:32:16] God and he put this is God's choosing he
[1:32:18] put everything he was into Christ and he
[1:32:20] says I'm running it through him and so
[1:32:22] our access is through Christ our
[1:32:24] Salvation is through Christ Our only
[1:32:26] comfort is through Christ it's all
[1:32:28] through Christ because that's the
[1:32:29] revealing of God to the bride in this
[1:32:32] time Amen to the
[1:32:34] Gentiles brother Bram continues he says
[1:32:36] what did he do the Bible said he was
[1:32:38] made a little lower than the angels in
[1:32:40] order for death he says that he might
[1:32:43] take away and abolish sin and take away
[1:32:44] sickness from the world he says now when
[1:32:46] he came down from the highest logos from
[1:32:49] God he came down through Angels came
[1:32:51] down and was made a man and he said I'm
[1:32:53] not evil even a man I'm a worm and no
[1:32:55] man for he was despised and rejected
[1:32:58] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:33:00] him he was m above every man he said he
[1:33:04] was probably a little skinny spin
[1:33:06] looking fellow didn't look like a
[1:33:08] king Church guess what he doesn't look
[1:33:11] like a king very much today either don't
[1:33:14] worry about how you look don't worry
[1:33:17] about people think about the outer
[1:33:18] package amen they're always fooled by
[1:33:22] the wrapping
[1:33:23] by the outer skin of God they never
[1:33:25] recognize him amen but there's a people
[1:33:27] that will he says many times that people
[1:33:30] judge people by the way they dress or by
[1:33:32] their
[1:33:33] stature man is not judged by how big he
[1:33:36] is and how strong is his muscles man is
[1:33:38] judged by character and character alone
[1:33:40] he said I've seen men that weigh 200 lb
[1:33:42] didn't have an ounce of man about them
[1:33:44] man is judged by character he says what
[1:33:47] he is in his heart he says and Christ
[1:33:49] was not judged by a physical strength
[1:33:51] but he was judged by character never man
[1:33:54] ever lived like him or never a man could
[1:33:56] ever die like him never a man could
[1:33:58] Ascend up on high like him because he
[1:34:00] was God he says I am of no man he says
[1:34:04] he made himself of no reputation that's
[1:34:06] why I said you want to think you if
[1:34:08] somebody's got a great anointing they'll
[1:34:10] have this they'll make themselves of no
[1:34:13] reputation he said did you ever think
[1:34:16] the man that made an artificial eye made
[1:34:18] a reputation the man that made false
[1:34:20] teeth made a reputation the man that
[1:34:22] made a wooden arm made a reputation
[1:34:23] ation for himself he says but the man
[1:34:25] who made the original eye the man who
[1:34:27] made the original arm made himself of no
[1:34:30] reputation but became a servant a
[1:34:33] bondsman unto men who were Sinners that
[1:34:35] he might win them
[1:34:37] back amen Jesus said he that is greatest
[1:34:40] among you let him be what your minister
[1:34:44] your
[1:34:45] servant and he did it by example
[1:34:48] amen he said if I your Lord and Master
[1:34:51] do it so ought you to do it wash their
[1:34:53] feet humble yourself before your
[1:34:55] brothers and
[1:34:57] sisters but Jesus would go from here and
[1:35:00] they they're challenging him about who
[1:35:02] he is and Jesus never held back he gave
[1:35:05] them the clear answers they were looking
[1:35:06] for he pointed to the word he pointed to
[1:35:08] his life he pointed to his words he says
[1:35:10] compare them and you'll find that I am
[1:35:12] he but the scripture says then came the
[1:35:14] Jews round about him and said unto him
[1:35:16] how long Dost thou make us to doubt if
[1:35:19] thou be the Christ tell us plainly stop
[1:35:22] beating around the bush Jesus he didn't
[1:35:23] beat her on the bush they just didn't
[1:35:25] want to hear it but they said we want to
[1:35:26] hear you say it not so they could
[1:35:29] believe but so that they could
[1:35:31] accuse sometimes people want to pin you
[1:35:33] down not so they can believe you but so
[1:35:35] they can hold you to something of their
[1:35:37] own making not of their not of the word
[1:35:40] and Jesus answered them said I told you
[1:35:41] and you believe not the works that I do
[1:35:44] in my father's name they bear witness of
[1:35:46] me so he says look at my life look at
[1:35:47] the things I do he says but ye believe
[1:35:50] not because ye are not of my sheep as I
[1:35:53] I said unto you church that means the
[1:35:56] revelation of God is not for everyone
[1:35:58] not everyone is going to recognize
[1:35:59] Christ not everyone is going to
[1:36:01] recognize his message not everyone is
[1:36:02] going to accept his
[1:36:04] word there's two flocks there's his
[1:36:07] sheep and then there's everybody else
[1:36:10] and we got to be okay with that
[1:36:12] amen he says my sheep hear my voice and
[1:36:16] I know them and they follow me that's
[1:36:18] always the identification of a child of
[1:36:21] God is they can hear the word they can
[1:36:23] accept the word they can obey the word
[1:36:25] and they can follow the word that's it
[1:36:28] that's it you do that and everything
[1:36:29] else in that word will come to you amen
[1:36:32] you can start as a as the the worst
[1:36:35] sinner on this planet and if you will
[1:36:37] accept acts 238 it will take you
[1:36:40] completely into eternal life that's
[1:36:42] simple that's simple but you know what
[1:36:45] 99.9% of the denominational world can't
[1:36:48] even do that because they they baptize
[1:36:50] in a different name they can't even do
[1:36:52] something so simple and so they can
[1:36:54] never go on to the Holy Ghost they need
[1:36:56] to do it according to the word simple
[1:36:59] obedience brother BR brother Braham said
[1:37:01] entitles you to the
[1:37:02] Token get baptized the right way truly
[1:37:05] repent turn your life around and you'll
[1:37:07] receive the Holy Ghost that's all there
[1:37:09] is to it but the thing is it's an open
[1:37:11] word now so you can't just say well this
[1:37:13] is all I want no you got to accept it
[1:37:16] all and that's what most people don't
[1:37:18] want because it is a complete surrender
[1:37:20] required to accept a complete word amen
[1:37:25] he says and I give them eternal
[1:37:27] life and they shall never perish neither
[1:37:31] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:37:33] my Father which gave them me is greater
[1:37:35] than all now if this is the if this is
[1:37:38] three persons in the Trinity and they're
[1:37:40] all co-equal Jesus says my father's
[1:37:42] greater than
[1:37:44] all so they there's something wrong
[1:37:47] there but this is the man speaking my
[1:37:50] Father which gave them me is greater
[1:37:51] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:37:53] them out of my father's hand remember he
[1:37:55] says they gave them me he says I've been
[1:37:58] given to them what did the scripture say
[1:38:00] in Isaiah unto us a child is born unto
[1:38:02] us a son is given amen he's just saying
[1:38:05] I'm fulfilling Isaiah folks don't you
[1:38:07] see it don't you see it he's confirming
[1:38:09] the word but he's also confirming this
[1:38:11] isn't about me the man this is about the
[1:38:13] God that's inside of me amen God is
[1:38:16] greater than all and Jesus is just
[1:38:18] revealing him through his life and then
[1:38:20] he says I am my father and one I mean he
[1:38:23] leaves no doubt about who he is he says
[1:38:25] I am the Messiah that's what he's saying
[1:38:28] here God is dwelling inside of me amen
[1:38:32] the Anointed God living in flesh it says
[1:38:35] then the Jews took up stones again to
[1:38:37] Stone him they keep trying to Stone him
[1:38:40] he says then Jesus answered them many
[1:38:42] good works have I showed you from my
[1:38:44] father for which of these Works do you
[1:38:45] Stone me he says I've done so many good
[1:38:47] things which of these good things is it
[1:38:49] that you're stoning me
[1:38:51] for Jesus didn't say I did The Works he
[1:38:54] says my father did The Works see we
[1:38:57] would say oh well I did that no he says
[1:38:59] no no no it's not me that does it it's
[1:39:01] the father in me that's doing it it's
[1:39:03] God living inside of me amen Jesus
[1:39:05] couldn't do a miracle until after Jordan
[1:39:07] he wasn't meant to that wasn't his
[1:39:09] ministry but as soon as God comes into
[1:39:11] him now there's Supernatural power and
[1:39:12] he can do whatever he needs to do the
[1:39:14] Jews answered him saying for a good work
[1:39:16] we Stone thee not we're not doing this
[1:39:18] because of what you you've done he says
[1:39:20] they said but for blasphemy and because
[1:39:22] thou being a man maketh thyself God and
[1:39:25] yet when you go to Isaiah it says that
[1:39:27] he would be all he would be Mighty God
[1:39:30] like brother Braham says you can't tell
[1:39:31] a Jew that God is three persons you
[1:39:34] can't cut God up for a Jew they don't
[1:39:36] believe it they believe that God is one
[1:39:37] and they believe that Messiah will be
[1:39:40] God in flesh and yet God in flesh is
[1:39:42] standing there and they can't see it why
[1:39:45] because they're not his children that's
[1:39:47] what Jesus said it's not a matter of
[1:39:50] Education it's a matter of do you have
[1:39:52] something on the inside side that
[1:39:53] connects with that word that's standing
[1:39:55] in front of you that's the only reason
[1:39:57] we can church that's the only reason we
[1:39:59] can do it today they knew their Doctrine
[1:40:02] perfectly and their Doctrine came and
[1:40:05] stood in front of them and they couldn't
[1:40:06] accept it that's a lesson for us to
[1:40:10] evening don't rely on the fact that
[1:40:12] you're raised in a message you believe
[1:40:13] an end time message you've heard a
[1:40:14] prophet and you know that Christ is
[1:40:16] coming now and revealing himself through
[1:40:18] his church you need to see it in your
[1:40:20] life not just hear it over a Pulpit and
[1:40:22] say I believe it
[1:40:24] amen Jesus answered them and said is it
[1:40:28] not written in your law that ye are Gods
[1:40:31] I said ye are Gods if he called them
[1:40:33] Gods unto whom the word of God came and
[1:40:35] the scripture cannot be broken say ye of
[1:40:38] him whom the father has
[1:40:41] Sanctified and sent into the world thou
[1:40:43] blasphemist because I said I am the Son
[1:40:45] of God if I do not the works of my
[1:40:47] father believe me not but if I do though
[1:40:51] ye believe not me believe The Works that
[1:40:54] ye may know and believe that the father
[1:40:56] is in me and I in him what is it perfect
[1:41:00] submission perfect Unity right there a
[1:41:02] man in flesh so perfectly in tune with
[1:41:04] the spirit of God that he could say I am
[1:41:06] him and he is me perfect Unity Heaven
[1:41:09] and Earth come down amen he says I'm in
[1:41:13] him and he's in me as we start to
[1:41:16] close for says this he says when Solomon
[1:41:18] built the temple and it was dedicated
[1:41:20] God came into that Temple and dwelt
[1:41:22] there is that right and when Jesus
[1:41:24] Christ was dedicated to God on the River
[1:41:26] Jordan God came down and dwelt in Jesus
[1:41:29] Christ he said he's Jehovah Jehovah of
[1:41:33] the old became Jesus Christ in the new
[1:41:36] amen I've got one long quote here and
[1:41:39] then we'll finish by God's grace he says
[1:41:41] he came as son of man the prophet even
[1:41:44] that little woman in all her sin there
[1:41:45] at the well she recognized him she said
[1:41:48] we know the messiah's coming which is
[1:41:49] called the Christ and that's what he'll
[1:41:51] do see she recogn because she was a
[1:41:54] predestinated seed where the rest of
[1:41:56] them didn't recognize it he says they
[1:41:59] had nothing to recognize with they were
[1:42:01] in sin to begin with he says for his
[1:42:05] acts he's speaking now as an actor in a
[1:42:08] play he changes his form then he came
[1:42:11] down in the form of son of man in the
[1:42:13] days of Christ for the reformers age
[1:42:15] Wesley Lutheran all down through then we
[1:42:17] find out that they got it so bundled up
[1:42:20] like the Israelites did till when he
[1:42:21] does appear in the last days the
[1:42:23] Pentecostal ages the Holy Spirit they
[1:42:25] rejected it they did the same thing
[1:42:27] Israel did he says and what does he do
[1:42:30] now so he's speaking now of the seventh
[1:42:31] Church age the last age the Pentecostal
[1:42:34] age he calls it the leosan church age he
[1:42:36] says he returns as son of man he returns
[1:42:40] as a prophet the prophet is not God but
[1:42:43] he returns in the ministry of a prophet
[1:42:45] brother Ram spoke or brother Mark spoke
[1:42:47] about this I think in the last service
[1:42:48] how God always uses a son of man
[1:42:50] Ministry to reveal Redemption every time
[1:42:54] Christ comes as son of man then what
[1:42:56] comes behind that Paul Paul completely
[1:42:59] opens up the book of redemption Paul
[1:43:01] completely shows us what it means to be
[1:43:03] part of the redeemed Paul's the one that
[1:43:05] tells us those who he has predestinated
[1:43:07] you've Justified you he Sanctified you
[1:43:09] he's perfected you he's placed you in
[1:43:11] Heavenly places he's showing us the
[1:43:13] whole picture the whole effect of
[1:43:14] redemption and Jesus never told us that
[1:43:17] but yet he did through Paul right by the
[1:43:19] Holy Spirit quickening him amen so it
[1:43:21] comes down through a son of man min
[1:43:23] Ministry to finalize Redemption first to
[1:43:25] the Gentiles and he does that in a
[1:43:27] Malachi 45 and 6 Ministry amen and then
[1:43:30] God takes Christ takes us up and then we
[1:43:33] go into the marriage supper and then
[1:43:34] what happens is he sends a son of man
[1:43:36] Ministry all over again to the Gentiles
[1:43:38] and that's what bringing them to
[1:43:40] Redemption 144,000 go there Christ never
[1:43:43] steps down on this Earth until the end
[1:43:45] of the
[1:43:46] tribulation and yet Christ is being
[1:43:48] revealed the whole
[1:43:49] time how son of man Ministry and then in
[1:43:52] the ministry of bride that's where he's
[1:43:54] revealed now he's never shown and all
[1:43:56] the world is looking for him to come
[1:43:57] back and the simple fact is he comes
[1:43:59] back and they never see him and by the
[1:44:01] time they finally get to see him every
[1:44:02] eye gets to see him and it's too late
[1:44:04] then and it's only judgment they've
[1:44:06] missed Christ in flesh again not just in
[1:44:10] profit but in you and I in the bride
[1:44:12] coming of Christ and we'll talk about
[1:44:13] that much much more in future Services
[1:44:16] Lord
[1:44:16] willing he says but then from that son
[1:44:20] of David he says see how close we are
[1:44:22] son of man son of David Son of God he's
[1:44:25] revealed in the last days of son of man
[1:44:27] according to Malachi 4 all the rest of
[1:44:29] the prophecies pertaining to this hour
[1:44:31] no more dealing with the church after
[1:44:33] they put him out he's on the outside
[1:44:35] knocking at the door there's some
[1:44:36] predestinated seed in there yet he must
[1:44:39] get to them and that's what the prophet
[1:44:40] of God was doing was he was saying come
[1:44:42] out of her my people and that's what
[1:44:44] we're doing today we tell people come
[1:44:45] out of her my people there's no life in
[1:44:48] denominations Christ is outside How can
[1:44:50] there be life there how can the full
[1:44:52] word be there the the word is outside
[1:44:54] that means they must be worshiping
[1:44:55] somebody else that's hard but it's true
[1:44:59] he says but God in man had emptied
[1:45:03] himself he says Joel 2:28 we find out he
[1:45:06] said I will pour out in the last days my
[1:45:10] spirit he says now if you notice the
[1:45:12] word there the Greek word he says you
[1:45:14] have to watch the words in English
[1:45:16] sometimes they mean double meanings just
[1:45:18] like the word we say God God created the
[1:45:20] heavens and earth Genesis 1 he says now
[1:45:22] in the Bible it said in the beginning
[1:45:25] Elohim he says now that word Elohim the
[1:45:27] English calls God but it really wasn't
[1:45:29] because brother B would say God is an
[1:45:31] object of worship there is nobody to
[1:45:32] worship him so God in English means an
[1:45:35] object of worship God in the Hebrew does
[1:45:36] not mean God there's a whole span of
[1:45:39] things that they use for that word God
[1:45:41] sometimes it's Adonai sometimes it's
[1:45:43] it's uh L or Elohim or these different
[1:45:46] ones and it all mean we just translate
[1:45:49] it as God or Lord sometimes but in in
[1:45:52] Hebrew they have so many different words
[1:45:54] for this word God and it's reflecting
[1:45:56] who he is and who he's revealing himself
[1:45:58] as he says anything can be God to the
[1:46:01] word God you can make an idol of God you
[1:46:03] can make a piano of God you can make
[1:46:04] anything of God he says but it isn't so
[1:46:07] in the word Elohim it means the
[1:46:09] self-existing one see that piano cannot
[1:46:12] be self-existing nothing else can be
[1:46:15] self-existent he says so the word Elohim
[1:46:17] mean means he that always existed God
[1:46:20] can mean anything see the difference in
[1:46:22] the word he's saying so don't just look
[1:46:24] at this word God you got to look at the
[1:46:25] deeper meaning of what's really there he
[1:46:27] says now when it's said here that he
[1:46:29] emptied himself or poured out he's
[1:46:31] talking about Joel 228 he says now we
[1:46:33] would think like this he would vomit up
[1:46:36] like you were emptying out your stomach
[1:46:38] or poured out from him see something
[1:46:40] went out of him that was different from
[1:46:42] him he says but the word kenos in the
[1:46:44] Greek does not mean that he vomited up
[1:46:47] or his arm went off or his eye went out
[1:46:49] or another person he says that is he
[1:46:51] changed himself he poured himself into
[1:46:54] another mask into another form not
[1:46:57] another person went out of him called
[1:46:59] the Holy Spirit but it was he
[1:47:02] himself he says now catch this this
[1:47:05] doesn't even make sense in typical
[1:47:06] English he says he himself poured
[1:47:09] himself into the
[1:47:12] people we're going to get into this as
[1:47:14] we get into the what is the holy ghost
[1:47:16] in us because we can look at the Holy
[1:47:18] Ghost as an
[1:47:20] object but it can't be an object
[1:47:23] it's a
[1:47:24] person he himself poured himself into
[1:47:29] the people God himself is living inside
[1:47:32] the bride today amen he says Christ in
[1:47:36] you how beautiful how wonderful to think
[1:47:39] God pouring himself into the human being
[1:47:41] into the believer pour out it was a part
[1:47:44] of his drama to do so God all the
[1:47:46] fullness all the godhead bodily was in
[1:47:48] this person Jesus Christ he was God and
[1:47:51] God Alone not a third person person or a
[1:47:53] second person or a first person but the
[1:47:56] person God veiled in human flesh 1
[1:47:59] Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy
[1:48:02] great is the mystery of godliness for
[1:48:04] God God Elohim Capital God in the Bible
[1:48:08] it refers to in the original it said
[1:48:10] Elohim in the beginning Elohim see
[1:48:12] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:48:14] of Elohim for Elohim was made flesh and
[1:48:18] we handled him he says Elohim veiled in
[1:48:22] human flesh the great Jehovah that
[1:48:25] covered all space time and everywhere
[1:48:27] was made man we handled him Elohim in
[1:48:30] the beginning Elohim and Elohim was made
[1:48:32] flesh and dwelt among us what he says
[1:48:36] this is his way the parts of the
[1:48:39] drama this is the way God does it in
[1:48:42] other words so don't be surprised if he
[1:48:45] changes his form
[1:48:47] again that's what God's trying to get
[1:48:49] through our heads don't just keep
[1:48:50] looking for that man to come back with
[1:48:53] nail scars in his hands and in his feet
[1:48:55] and a spear hole in his side look for
[1:48:58] God to reveal himself through his
[1:49:01] word he says this is his way the parts
[1:49:03] of the drama that's the way he's to act
[1:49:06] it out his way of revealing himself to
[1:49:08] us as some different person he says we
[1:49:12] are mortal and he knows that and we only
[1:49:15] understand as Mortals we only know as
[1:49:16] Mortals we only know as our senses will
[1:49:18] let us know and the rest of it we
[1:49:21] believe by faith amen he says we have to
[1:49:25] say there is a God whether we see him or
[1:49:27] not we believe it anyhow see whether
[1:49:29] there is or not we still believe it
[1:49:31] because God said so there is a Point
[1:49:34] Church where we have to walk by faith I
[1:49:37] have seen certain things and so you
[1:49:39] cannot tell me they do not exist I have
[1:49:41] heard certain things and so you cannot
[1:49:43] tell me that they were not said but
[1:49:44] there are things in this word that I
[1:49:46] have not yet experienced but yet because
[1:49:48] I have he heard and seen and experienced
[1:49:50] a portion I believe that which I have
[1:49:52] not seen heard or experienced yet that's
[1:49:55] the Walk of Faith amen whether there is
[1:49:59] or not we still believe it because God
[1:50:01] said so he says notice all the glory
[1:50:04] that is in God is in the word all the
[1:50:07] blessings that's in God is in the word
[1:50:10] he says it's hid to the unbeliever by
[1:50:13] Traditions I was showing brother Joe
[1:50:15] something at the house the other day
[1:50:16] where there was a a a woman talking
[1:50:19] about signs and wonders and this man got
[1:50:21] up and he called her out as a false
[1:50:24] prophet now I'm not saying this woman in
[1:50:26] particular was a correct Prophet but he
[1:50:28] said God is only revealing himself
[1:50:30] through his word now and what was he
[1:50:33] saying he was saying God is bound by
[1:50:35] these
[1:50:36] Pages What a Sad place to live where
[1:50:39] you've got the word without the life of
[1:50:41] the word you've got the word without the
[1:50:43] spirit of the word you don't even have
[1:50:44] the truth of the word because you're
[1:50:45] binding it by your own
[1:50:47] Traditions why because you don't have
[1:50:50] what it says that's why they believe it
[1:50:52] is because they don't have it we believe
[1:50:54] it because we have it in portion and
[1:50:56] we're believing we're going to get the
[1:50:57] rest of it amen everything we have need
[1:51:00] of is given to us when we receive the
[1:51:02] Holy Spirit and it's just a
[1:51:03] manifestation that's coming out over
[1:51:05] time he says it's hid to the unbeliever
[1:51:07] by tradition see what I mean but it's
[1:51:09] all in Christ all that God was he
[1:51:12] emptied himself kenos and came into
[1:51:15] Christ he says and we into Christ are
[1:51:18] behind the veil what we're behind the
[1:51:21] veil that hides Christ that hides God
[1:51:24] we're in the
[1:51:25] veil if you're behind the veil that
[1:51:27] means that the world is looking at the
[1:51:29] veil and you're inside of
[1:51:31] it amen so they're seeing a veil of
[1:51:35] flesh but you're inside there and it's
[1:51:37] Christ in you amen how did Paul say we
[1:51:40] get into that how do we get inside the
[1:51:42] veil by one Spirit by one Spirit we get
[1:51:45] in there it's the new birth that gets us
[1:51:46] in there and nothing else amen God bless
[1:51:48] you let's stand this evening
[1:51:52] it always amazes me and I know I've said
[1:51:54] this many times how when Christ died and
[1:51:57] there was that that great earthquake and
[1:51:58] the the veil to the holy of holies was
[1:52:00] torn from top to bottom showing it was
[1:52:02] an act of God not an act of man and the
[1:52:05] shikina glory of God
[1:52:07] left and the the the the rod of Aaron
[1:52:10] stopped budding and the Mana that had
[1:52:12] stayed fresh for 1600 years whatever it
[1:52:15] was went moldy and yet those priests
[1:52:18] continued to go in there and worship and
[1:52:22] bring blood knowing that the presence of
[1:52:24] God had left and it had moved someplace
[1:52:27] else why because they missed the veil of
[1:52:29] the man Jesus Christ and so they could
[1:52:31] not come in and go up on the day of
[1:52:33] Pentecost and receive him the same way
[1:52:36] amen we've got one more service ahead of
[1:52:39] this on godhead as far as I can tell
[1:52:41] just on the way I'm being led and the
[1:52:42] way I'm studying and then we'll kind of
[1:52:44] get back to our more traditional not
[1:52:46] more traditional but kind of the
[1:52:47] direction we were heading on this this
[1:52:49] idea of the token life and what it means
[1:52:50] to have the Holy Spirit and how we know
[1:52:52] we have it and what it does in our lives
[1:52:54] and that but I just felt to drop this in
[1:52:56] and I know some of it's pretty heavy but
[1:52:58] I wanted to go through this teaching
[1:52:59] it's been on my mind and on my heart for
[1:53:01] a long time and so I really felt that
[1:53:03] this was the time to do it so I'm
[1:53:05] trusting you have a better understanding
[1:53:06] I hope I haven't made it more uh more
[1:53:10] difficult than it needs to be and and as
[1:53:11] I said at the beginning of this I cannot
[1:53:14] understand all of God I don't profess to
[1:53:17] understand all things of God by any
[1:53:18] means amen but I'm hoping you can see
[1:53:20] that the revealing of God is just God
[1:53:22] changing his form time and time again
[1:53:25] that's the Simplicity of what the
[1:53:26] godhead is it's not people it's not
[1:53:28] three persons it's not these things it's
[1:53:30] just God changing his form his
[1:53:31] appearance and you're a part of it amen
[1:53:34] and you're a part of it and that's the
[1:53:35] most wonderful thing I think we could
[1:53:37] have is that we could become a part of
[1:53:39] God not because we weren't but because
[1:53:41] we were always a part of him by the word
[1:53:44] of God and His Thoughts amen God bless
[1:53:46] you let's buy our heads Heavenly
[1:53:50] Father Lord what a wonderful thing it is
[1:53:53] to think that you came down and you
[1:53:55] dwelt Lord in flesh and we could handle
[1:53:58] you and we could hear you Lord not us
[1:54:00] personally Lord but Fallen Humanity
[1:54:02] could come down you could come down to
[1:54:04] and they could they could interact with
[1:54:06] Elohim Lord the self-existing
[1:54:09] one Lord and yet they missed it
[1:54:11] completely so many of them but Lord
[1:54:14] we're in another time and in another
[1:54:15] season Lord and you're revealing
[1:54:17] yourself Lord not just in a body Lord
[1:54:19] but in a body of a bride Lord that you
[1:54:21] are the head of and I pray Lord that
[1:54:23] we're not missing it these days Lord
[1:54:25] that we're not making that holy spirit
[1:54:27] inside of us some different part of you
[1:54:29] or just Lord some some element or some
[1:54:32] portion Lord but that it could be a
[1:54:33] revelation that it is you yourself the
[1:54:37] very person of God living and dwelling
[1:54:39] through each and every one of us Lord
[1:54:41] God lord we need a greater revelation of
[1:54:43] that this evening Lord I need it I know
[1:54:46] Lord I pray that as we've gone through
[1:54:47] this Lord that there's been Clarity Lord
[1:54:49] and if there's not Lord I pray that you
[1:54:51] would clear it up Lord that you would
[1:54:53] just help us to see ourselves in our
[1:54:55] word Lord not just Lord Place it outside
[1:54:57] of us Lord but that it would be a very
[1:54:59] part of us Lord that our eyes would be
[1:55:01] open Lord and we'd see ourselves in you
[1:55:03] through the word Lord bless our people
[1:55:06] Lord bless each one that's here Lord
[1:55:08] there's many needs Lord many needs
[1:55:10] thinking again of Young Noah Lord sister
[1:55:12] Beverly and brother Doug's grandson Lord
[1:55:14] we pray a special mercy and Grace to him
[1:55:16] Lord for those that aren't here tonight
[1:55:18] those that could be and didn't Lord
[1:55:20] those that had to stay or work or do
[1:55:22] whatever Lord we pray your special Grace
[1:55:24] to them Lord may you be with us Lord
[1:55:26] help us to be Witnesses and testimonies
[1:55:28] for you throughout this week Lord guard
[1:55:30] and protect us we ask in Jesus Christ's
