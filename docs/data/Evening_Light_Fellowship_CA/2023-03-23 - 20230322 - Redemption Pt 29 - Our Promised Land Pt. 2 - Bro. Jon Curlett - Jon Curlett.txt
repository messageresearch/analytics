the master Potter Lord we pray Lord may you just Minister Grace Lord to us that we would just humble ourselves to your word Lord that we would follow the leading of your Holy Spirit Lord God Lord that we would draw closer to you day in and day out we ask heavenly father and Lord even as we're gathered here tonight Lord may we take one step closer to glory Lord one step closer to Eternity one close one step closer Lord to a life spent only with you where nothing can touch us ever more Heavenly Father Lord encourage your people tonight we pray Lord correct us where we need it Lord forgive us where we fall short Lord and just touch us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen amen God bless you if you would turn in your scriptures to Joel 2. amen thank you musicians it's uh it's always a pleasure to sit there and listen to the song service and I have to say I do enjoy it where I don't have a bass amp six inches from my head the way we used to you know I can enjoy it in its fullness not in its you know that that suddenness of of them sitting on the other side of the wall while you're trying to prepare for service so I always enjoy it's good to have brother Paul back with us and he wasn't feeling well brother David's back and he wasn't feeling well and different ones so welcome them back good to have brother Josh and sister Rochelle I've been enjoying the song Services you know I was thinking back there that we've gotta we've got good song leaders they have a blend it's not all old and it's not all new it's not all shouting and dancing songs it's it's a blend of those things uh there's a minister a message Minister said recently says you know we've we don't sing the old hymns anymore and he he basically said the new songs are no good but I believe if the holy spirit's here and you can have a young preacher preach an anointed sermon then you can have a new person that can write an anointed song and we can worship by the new and we can worship by the old amen the holy spirit's not dead we still have musicians we still have songwriters today that can that can catch the the influence and the leadership of the holy spirit for these things so I'm glad to have it and I enjoy listening to it it's probably the biggest thing I miss ministering as much as I have been is that that ability to just come in and just sit there and just relax and worship God and and it's it's different when you're sitting in the office of course but it's good to hear it I'm certainly glad to have brother Josh and sister Rachelle back amen appreciate your prayers for Selena she's doing much better I think Lord willing she will go to work tomorrow but we just kind of kept her home tonight abundance of caution we don't want to be passing covert to anyone unnecessarily we've mostly been staying away from her so and we'd spend some time with different ones in the church so we said it doesn't really make a difference if we're not here tonight or not so where everybody came so so we're here and just trusting the Lord to protect us each one amen Joel 2 28 very familiar scripture 4 says and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening we are continuing with our Redemption series as you might imagine and I want to take a second part of this this idea that we started last service on our promised land and we spoke about the Covenant that God had made to Abraham and to his seed and we showed you the scripture that we are Abraham's seed because we are in Christ and we are children enough Faith amen we are not children of performance we're not children of Good Deeds but we are children of faith and we come from God and we go to God and we're going to kind of dig into how how he spoke of that even when he spoke of Abraham and these things and we know that because we are a part of that abrahamic line because we are the spiritual Seed of Abraham we have access to the same Covenant that Abraham did and and just to give a bit of a background here to to bring those up to speed that weren't here and just to kind of set the tone for the service this is this is the Covenant we read last time and it was what God Said to Abraham and he says I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and we see here that this was unconditional God didn't say if you're good children then I'll be a good dad or if you're bad children that I won't be a dad but he says I'm going to be your father to you I'm going to be a God to you and he didn't say it's dependent on anything that we did it was completely unconditional and so if you are a child of Abraham which means you are a child of Faith by the word of God then there is nothing you can do to change the fact that God is your father amen that you come from God and you go back to God in these things but I want to set up a contrast because so often we can get caught up in the Israelite Covenant and not the abrahamic Covenant because if we look in Leviticus 26 we see that God said this he says if you walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments and so do them then I will give you rain and due season and the land shall yield her increase in the Trees of the field shall yield their fruit and your threshing shall reach under the Vintage and the Vintage shall reach under the sowing time and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely and I will give you peace in the land and you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and I will rid evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and he will continue on for the sake of time I didn't put it there but he says but if you don't then you're going to have problems with your Harvest you're going to have problems with your health you're going to lose your land you're going to be dressed given over by the different nations that will come in and I'll use them to chastise you in these different things and the point I'm making is that Israel had a performance-based covenant when it came to holding the land when it came to the possession of the land and the blessings that were in their land they had to actively choose to follow God in order to get the land and to hold on to the land because remember God brought them into his into Canaan land and he drove the occupants out of the land but what happened after that was completely dependent on the Israelites whether they have Victory whether they had wealth whether they had food in the in the fridge or in the cupboard whether everything was going well or everything was going to bed was completely dependent on their performance to the word of God if they were obedient or disobedient that determined if they could even hold on to the land that they got their attitude their faithfulness all these things were what tied them to that land and if it went downhill if they weren't according to the word of God then they got booted out of the land and they were made slaves and they they lost all the benefits and the blessings but that's not our covenant praise the lord it's not our covenant that it's dependent on our performance in these things amen we as Gentiles had failed God time and time again if we look at that time in the Israelites in the time of Canaan and even on on from there we weren't even a part of of God as it was in the children of Israel they were a chosen people they had the word they had the prophet said all these things and everything was focused on them and yet they never seemed to succeed and God said I'm going to use another people to drive you to jealousy and he was saying I'm going to go to the Gentiles by grace and I'm going to make a people and I'm going to make a bride out of them and then I'm going to come back and take a Remnant out of you but he says I can't do it with them for performance because they don't even know what they're supposed to do they don't even know I exist they're serving other gods or they're serving no Gods at all they're living according to the dictates of their own heart and they're a mess and we see even in this age that's where the Gentiles are today is we're a mess I don't believe as message Believers we're a mess but the world is a mess because they don't even know God brother brother Chad had one he had Jeremiah asked me a question the other day and he said brother John he says people that are in a church that believe the Trinity when they worship God does he accept it I said which God because they're worshiping three even if they don't recognize they're worshiping three they don't even know the god that they're worshiping so if they're not worshiping him in spirit and in truth then their worship is not sacrificed because the requirement of a Believer today is to worship Him in spirit and in truth and if it's not right then how can he accept it and if you don't even know the god you're serving then how can he accept your worship so we have to know these things and he came to us and it was by grace and Paul would reflect on this in Ephesians 2 he says wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands he says the Jews called you the uncircumcised outside of the Covenant he says that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope no hope and without God in this world but now in Christ Jesus ye who are sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us so we come all the way into the New Testament and Paul points back to the abrahamic Covenant and he ties the Gentiles into it and he comes up with a new description for it and it's called predestination because predestination is the choosing of God it's not the choosing of me it's not the choosing of you because we have we see it even the world today we have people that will reach out to God and nothing happens and then you have people that are walking along walking down the road and then God just comes in and he Taps him on the shoulder and he says you're a child of mine and I want you to know it and I need you to know because I've got to do some amazing things in your life and so you have to come out and you have to walk separate and you have to be with me it reminds me of brother Mark's testimony just sitting there reading a newspaper reading an ad and something comes out and what was it it was God saying you're my child and he's sitting there saying say what he probably didn't even know what was happening at that moment but it was God coming down no different than Abraham Church and when God steps down and he lets you know that you're his child it's no different than Abraham that's exactly what he's doing is he's letting you know I put something in you I chose you before you ever chose me and now I'm telling you about it and the fact that you can even recognize me and acknowledge me and come back to me proves that I chose you in the beginning that's the only reason you can do it we are children of Abraham because God calls us the same way and we respond the same way and it's by faith even though we had no idea what it was to be a child of God before that maybe Paul would say this in Ephesians 1 he says that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him notice he says gather together in one one place one body it's one Spirit we know and then we talked about it last service how Israel had one land and we have one body and that means we're all gathered in a place but each of us has our place within that place each of us has a portion within that portion each of us has a a position or a purpose within that body if I could put it that way so theirs was a natural land ours is a spiritual land and it's the mystical body of Jesus Christ brother Brandon will call it it's the bride of Christ he says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of who of him that worketh who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so here we see what it means to have an unconditional Covenant and he calls it predestination here it's the choosing of God beforehand and Paul says he did it by his purpose and by his will it's not by our influence it's nothing we could say or do even now it's nothing we did back then but we cannot influence the choosing of God it's a done deal when he's done it and then we just have to step into it amen it's been done since before the foundation of the world he says why that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ that's one thing about an unconditional Covenant is that you don't get any Glory out of it because it's not reflecting you it's reflecting the one that made the Covenant in the first place but I want you to realize that this predestination word doesn't just reflect the choosing of God but it reflects the idea that there is a will of God and there is a purpose of God behind the choosing because otherwise we just stop at justification say he chose me and I'm accepting the finished work of Calvary and we'd stop there but the reason we're speaking on Redemption is to take us to the idea that he has called us for a purpose and it's a purpose of his will and it's a purpose of his making and so that means that each and every one of our Lives is specifically built to bring us to what we need to be we talk about the master Potter and being submitted to the master Potter's hand in everything that we do in life is God working to bring us to that portion of the word that we're supposed to reflect and it's the literal attributes of God that he's placed inside of you that are supposed to be brought out in each and every one of us and it's already determined and like I said before the only question is will you go easy or will you go hard that's the only part you play is will you surrender and submit and relax and just say Lord you've got me and I'm going to trust you or will you fight and hold and struggle onto things all your life listen you're going to let go eventually because it'll hurt too much to hold on because you keep messing things up we keep not you we keep think messing things up I I I sometimes I do I say you but I'm preaching to the collective you we're all we're all there I'm sitting in there with you amen Ephesians 5 Paul would say this he said husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church past tense done deal he says the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that's something that he was going to do before he after he loved her there's a he loves her and then he does something with it and then it says that he might future tense presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so in other words he loved you past tense and then he said in motion all the events that are going to take place and all the things and all the remedies and all the solutions to make you what he wants you to be that's the unconditional Covenant of God Paul would say this in Ephesians 2 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God the Salvation is a gift and the faith itself is a gift not of Works lest any man should boast four excuse me for we are his workmanship we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so we have a path we have a purpose we have good works that he has ordained that he has set out for each and every one of us to do and he says you're built for that purpose and when you do that purpose you're walking perfectly before God and he doesn't see anything else all he sees is what you're doing that's according to his his predestinated plan for your life to wrap it up in first John 4 4 John says ye are of God little children and have overcome them he's talking about the spirits that deny Jesus Christ he says you have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the word I looked at that phrase there ye are of God and I said there's more to that than meets the eye and I hadn't looked into it but I just said there's got to be more there because it triggered another scripture which we'll read in a moment but I dug into it and in the commentary it said this is one of the poorest translated words in the Bible because that word of is it can mean anything and it means nothing to us but as I dug into it it said that word of means a separation from something which there has been a close connection he says so you are from something with which you had a close connection so in other words you were originally part of something and now you're not there's been a division that's occurred but he says you come out of something and he says you come out of God but then they in the commentary it says this word of has a two-layer meaning and it means you came out from but then it says you are going to so in other words he says it makes it outcome oriented when he says you are of God it means you come from something and then there's an impact that takes place in your life and it returns you back to where you came from it's restoring you back to what you were this word of littering means you are the redeemed in that little word of it means you come out of and you go too and there's something in behind it that has an impact that's pushing you it says it's outcome oriented it means you're the redeemed of God and because of that you have to go back to him origin is Destiny for the believer and that's what we're being restored back to is you've got to be restored back to your original position and John says you are from God and therefore you must go back to God that's what this means here you're taken from a source and that word means that you're being affected by that source to draw you all the way back to where you were in the beginning it's a path that's already laid out of out for you if you look at this closely and it reminded me even as I was reading that of Jesus and it says that Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God listen that's the exact same Revelation that we have to have is that we recognize we come from God and therefore like Christ we must go back to God there's a restoration there's a Redemption amen we are his purchased possession we are we are the bone of his bone we are the Flesh of his flesh our names are engraved in the palms of his hand and he said I won't lose any one of them and when he says you are of me that means you always will be of me and you will always be with me and you'll be a part of me and I can't lose any one of you I won't lose any one of you he declared I won't lose a single one of you amen so like I said the only problem is will we surrender will we let him have his way in our lives Romans 8 28 Paul says and we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose there is called and then there is thee called within the call there is the call because everybody hears the gospel and some feel a tug but some are the actual called remember the the parable of the net and they cast it out and they brought in fishes but they only chose some of the fishes all of those fishes got called but only a few were chosen they were the ones that he was looking for and the gospels the same way the thing is we don't know who that is so we treat everyone the same it says for whom he did for no past tense he also did predestinate past tense to be conformed future to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate past tense then he also called past tense and whom he called them he also Justified past tense and whom he justified them he also glorified past tense you are sitting in the sight of God in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus as if you never did it in the first place you are sinless Perfection you are glorified in his eyes right now in the presence of God because of the work that the lamb did even before the foundation of the world and Paul would take this and he would say then what shall we say then to these things what do we do with it what do we do with it what will we say about this he says if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things Paul's sitting there and he's saying recognize your position recognize what he's done for you it's a finished work it's done Church you don't have to worry you can rest and trust that where you are today is where he wants you to be and as long as your conscience is clear and you're not holding him back he's going to keep moving you forward you can rest that you are literally exactly where God wants you to be in life today Paul's saying he's made a way and he's already finished the work in his mind and your name is written in a book that there's no erasing there's no erasing the names that are in the Lamb's Book of Life cannot be erased like the rest of the book that's where you sit today that's the unconditional Covenant that we're sitting under today is that it is a finished work and he has already prepared and worked out a way for you to return back to him and all we're doing is getting back to him now we're going to get back to him and all we got to do is go through the getting back to him part that's the trial of our faith every every time amen Paul says it here he says listen if God's for us who can be against us who can stop God listen we've seen it in the natural we've seen it in Egypt when they tried to stop God and in the end they were crying for mercy and then when they got caught up and decided to try again then God destroyed them all and time and time again we see what happens when this when Satan comes against the children of God and every time he is rebuffed and pushed back why because God cannot be defeated he cannot be defeated he cannot be stopped amen his word cannot return to avoid it void as the scripture says amen Paul will continue in Romans 8 and he says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us he says for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come what does that mean Church don't worry about what's happening today don't let that get you down and then don't borrow trouble from tomorrow either because sufficient to the day is the evil thereof but don't get worried about it don't borrow that trouble amen Paul says listen nothing that's going on nothing that's going to happen can separate us from the love of God he says nor height so when it's taller than you when it's bigger than you don't worry nor death when it's too deep and you can't go under it when it's too tall you can't go over it or go around it he says don't worry he says nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord listen church he has decided that you're going to return to him and nothing in this world will stop it that's the unconditional Covenant it's not based on performance it's based on his promise amen I want to go back to that that was the warm-up that was the warm-up hey man now we're going to jump back to what we've read about in in the last in the last service if you'd hit that next slide please Genesis 15 1. it says after these things the Lord the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and I exceeding great reward amen I want to drive it deep again that this is not a performance-based walk it is a promise-based walk and it is his promise that we are resting on Amen we're not where we are and doing what we're doing because we've done such a good job it's because he's done a work in us and that's why we're able to stand and that's why we're able to hold firm and that's why we're able to to hold hold steady when the enemy comes in like a like a flood in these different things I was reading it or listening in adoption this morning where brother Branham says that that in the in the beginning he called himself Elohim the self-existing one he says but as soon as he what created Adam he changed his name to Jehovah and he said that means god with his family and that's how he identifies himself moving forward god with his family and he says all he's trying to do is get us back to Reign and Rule with him God with his family again that's what this whole Redemption story his very title his very name reflects the fact that we are a part of him amen but we are where we are like I said it's not performance it's promised we are where we are because God has stooped and he has wooed and he has called and he has pulled and he has waited and he has been patient with us so that we would respond and come back to him like I've said many times if you feel far away from God it's not because he's left you it's because you left him and all you have to do is come back to where you left him and he's waiting there patiently just waiting for you to come back second Timothy 2 13 this is maybe one of my favorite scriptures he says if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself you say does he forgive me every time brother John all I know is that Timothy said Paul said to Timothy he cannot deny himself brother Brian said he was talking about Abraham and he says listen Abraham goes down to Gerard and he lies to the king and he gets himself in trouble because the king takes Sarah and he says God goes to that King and says you're a dead man Abraham did wrong Abraham lied Abraham deceived and then and brother Brown says God goes and tells that righteous man you're a dead man and he says Lord what did I do what did I do he says you took the wife of my prophet he said I didn't even know he says it doesn't matter that's the wife of my Prophet you can't touch her he says restore her back to him and go and have him pray for you and I'll be okay and I'll let you go but then he says but what happened to Abraham he says did God let him get away with it he says no Abraham had to repent that's what we're required to do is repent we don't just walk through life happy-go-lucky and doing this and doing that and doing that and then God just lets it slide he makes us repent and guess what he makes us repent he makes us sorry we did it he lets us know that this is not something you want to do again and how does he do it by chastisement sometimes we repent immediately sometimes he's got to let the effects hit us a bit and then we start to say whoa I'm really sorry I did that but one way or another he's not going to let us away with it amen remember his children he's going to bring us back to him but right after we read that scripture remember in Genesis 15 where he says I am thy exceeding great reward and Abraham right after that says he bows down to God and he says God thanks but how can you prove it to me he says I've been walking this yeah I'm reading between lines he's like I've been going for years and years decades Lord and nothing's happened and he says Lord would you give me proof that you're going to do what you said you were going to do and instead of reading the scriptures the scriptures are brief I want to read and this is a lengthy set of quotes but brother Branham goes into it and he digs into it beautifully and so I want to read his words rather than try and say it myself I was looking for a picture just for the the Covenant that that happens with the sacrifices and I I ran across this guy online and he was trying to explain this and I say this to let you know we ought to be happy we have a prophet to explain these things because this man went into this and this talks about there's a bullock that gets cut in half and there's a ram that's cut in half and these different things and this guy came out of it and he said this is a representation of Islam and and Judaism and and and the five uh animals that were killed represent the mother the Father the Son the daughter and the and like he came up with this big conglomeration of what this was and it made no sense whatsoever listen if you go into your King James version they'll usually point you pretty straight if you have a uh a Bible like I've got you know most of it the Scofield Edition is pretty good on these things but brother Branham digs into it so much deeper because he's looking as a prophet back to what Beyond Time he's looking Beyond in the beginning is really what we're seeing here okay so we're going to talk about this is God's proof to Abraham of his Covenant and that he was going to do what he promised it says then years past Abraham and Sarah still believing that they were going to have a baby why God said so God said I have saved you Abraham and I've saved your seed after you not only Abraham but Abraham's seed also he says now I want you to know what Abraham's seed is Abraham's seed is not seeds it's the Seed of Abraham which come through Isaac and Isaac to Christ he says am we Hallelujah being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise how is the Covenant given it's unconditional everyone that God calls chooses elects that person has the same promise that Abraham had Amen brother if that doesn't shake the stalactites in the devil's eyes I don't know what does your Abraham seed not what you've done what God has done past tense for you you're in Abraham he says seed singular he says now Abraham wanted to know a confirmation that God would keep this he says oh I want you to notice it's so lovely so beautiful he said how will I know these things Lord see then I'm old nearly a hundred years old now how am I going to know that you're going to keep this with me how do I know this Covenant is going to be kept here's what he said listen now he said come out here Abraham I'm going to show you what I'm going to do listen we're looking for a resurrection and a Rapture aren't we we're looking for an outpouring of the Dynamics to make the mechanics live beyond what we've had to date I want you to read because this isn't just for Abraham this is for us now he says and Abraham took a heifer of three years old he took a goat of three years old he took a ram of three years old and he split them in half and laid them out on the bank and then he took a turtle dove and a pigeon and he didn't separate those why didn't he separate those he says I wish I had time to go in and show you how law and grace are different and so forth but when it comes to the turtle doves or pigeon he says any Bible reader knows that that was the cleansing for healing not the guy that I was reading online apparently but he says you don't he says there was a healing which in these covenants here are separated he says but Divine Healing has always been in every Covenant and every time they're unseparated they're laid in there the Pigeon in the turtle dovey says they never lost the promise for Divine Healing the Abraham doesn't lose it either he said these other laws and Grace and so forth was divided but this turtle dove and pigeon was not divided they were laid in whole he says notice I want you to get this notice that at that time God said Abraham I'm going to show you how I'm going to do this and he swore by it swore that he would do it then watch what he did he went out there and he put him to sleep and Abraham watched the birds first so what happened is Abraham came out and there was they he cut the animals he split them open and we'll understand why in a minute and then the birds came down because God didn't come down and do anything the birds came down and they were getting on the sacrifice and so Abraham was beating off all these Birds because they were going to eat the sacrifice he says Abraham watch The Birds first off the sacrifices until the sun went down he drove him off to sacrifice them when the sun went down brother Brown says now watch God telling Abraham now I'm going to show you Abraham that you or your seat after you hasn't got one thing to do with this I my I'm doing this myself by election he says hallelujah oh my get it Pentecostal people here's the foundation of Grace here's the foundation of faith and why we can have faith an unmistakable faith in the Lord Jesus Christ watch close now where when he come down the Holy Spirit to talk to Abraham in the garden out there where he was laying on the hill he put Abraham to sleep and said now Abraham you haven't got one thing to do all right you lay here now and Abraham went to sleep brother Branham says you're out of the picture and the next thing he says what's God going to do he's confirming and giving an Evidence he's giving an Evidence or a proof to Abraham how he's going to do this amen how he's going to do it listen he says if you want to be healed how he's going to do this how he's going to heal you he says then Abraham I'm shutting you out of the picture I'm putting you to sleep then before Abraham come a thickness afterwards so before Abraham woke up there came a black thickness after he says every sinner deserves to go to hell Blackness then after that a smoking burning furnace he says every sinner deserving Abraham that's what you deserve but beyond that went to little white light that little white light went right between those pieces of sacrifice right back and forth the white light moving showing making a confirmation showing to Abraham that he would do someday through his seed Isaac bringing on Christ for the Supreme sacrifice he says now a covenant has always been a strange thing in the Eastern orients during this time when they made a covenant they went and killed a beast they split it open and they stood between this despite dead beast and they wrote out their Covenant I hereby say that a certain certain thing he says they write the agreement the Covenant the agreement then they take this agreement and they tear it to pieces one piece is given to one man and the other to the other one and when this contract he says they take an oath over this dead Beast let my body be as this dead Beast if I don't keep this Covenant but remember who was standing in between the beasts was Abraham standing there no so Abraham's not making the Covenant there's only one thing standing in the middle and it's a white light it's God walking back and forth between it he says watch God was then in spirit how could God be tore apart God wasn't in flesh so you couldn't tear his body apart he says how could God be tore apart but one day God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the Lord Jesus Christ the Emmanuel and then there at Calvary the Covenant God wrote with us he took the Christ to Calvary and tore him apart body and soul and body and he took his body up to set it at the right hand of his majesty and sent the spirit back here on Earth to make a covenant to carry out the gospel and the same dovetail power that Jesus Christ had he's the same yesterday today and forever he says and the church is given a covenant and the Covenant is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the Seed of Abraham Joel 2 28 he says I'll pour out all my spirit upon them and he says the Holy Ghost which is the Seed of Abraham what is the Seed of Abraham he says in all thy seed the Earth shall be blessed he says it's through Isaac pointing to who Christ he says Christ is the literal Seed of Abraham that's where the blessing comes forth and he says then you're going to be a part of that Christ then amen he says which is the Seed of Abraham the Holy Ghost is the Seed of Abraham will bring him to us and then God making this Covenant that every man that's called into the grace of God by the Holy Ghost has the same promise that Abraham had of eternal life he says now you can't have a piece of paper that just impersonates it you can't drop some contract and tear it apart and says I've got eternal life that's what he's saying you can't make up your own way to eternal life he says you can't have a piece of paper that just makes something like it it's got to be the same piece of paper and the same spirit that was on Jesus Christ has come back on his church doing the same signs the same wonders the same Holy Ghost the same power it's the Covenant that God give to them he says and Jesus died there in the evening time when the sun was going down confirming this Covenant and the Holy Ghost is on the church tonight leading the church just like he was here when he was leading Christ the same way the same Ministry Christ had in his church tonight is in his church tonight the same signs the same wonders The Same Spirit the same kind of works that Jesus did here on Earth the church has to do the same thing has to do it he says if it's not it's not the Seed of Abraham it's not the Church of Jesus Christ it can't be that's why I say we need Dynamics poured out on the mechanics and brother Brahm said that's what has to follow and we saw it as a wave offering as a chief offering in brother branham's Ministry and that same anointing is on the bride to bring her to that same place and it won't be manifested in one man the way it was but it'll be manifested across the body and I believe that's how it won't be a public show because it won't be all in one man it'll be spread out over hundreds thousands who knows how many are there and it'll just be a little one here and a little one there and something that happens in your prayer closet and something happens in a little church in on the east coast of Canada something that happens on a church in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows about it except the ones that are there it's not a public show but the Dynamics have to be there brother Brown says otherwise it's not Christ we've got further to go Church we've got a growth that has to happen we've got a maturity that has to come to us and it'll be his working not ours he says Pentecostal people he's not talking to Pentecostals he's talking to Pentecostals the real Pentecostals the original Pentecostals he says Pentecostal people do you see that that's you these others can't believe in that there's nothing in them to believe with but the trouble of it is you've got it and you don't know it he says if the devil if you can get it and he can hide it from you and not let you know you've got it he's got you licked see you can't fall there's no way of failing sorry that you can't fail there's no way of failing he says you're Abraham's seed God has sworn with an oath that he take you in amen there you are he's made his Covenant Hallelujah that's how we're getting in church is because he said we're going to make it that's the only way we're going to make it he says Jesus Christ is his Covenant and he tore him apart at Calvary received the body up and sent the Holy Ghost back and when the Resurrection comes the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ is the only thing that will raise this body up to go meet that one there he says that makes them husband and wife you see what I mean the bride is the Covenant people unconditionally God called you out of the world gave you the Holy Ghost the Seed of Abraham you are tonight with a blessed promise he says amen then he says if you're Abraham's seed you have this promise in you you believe God regardless of what takes place he says the Holy Ghost makes you believe it anyhow we hope without hope We Believe without sin and it seems so foolish it seems so so so silly so many times because nothing seems to be happening but yet that is the characteristic of the Believers that they believe and they believe and they believe and they're looking and expecting for the things of God in their life amen that's what we're held to will you believe if thou can'tst believe all things are possible that's why we sing only believe brother Brown says the angel of the lord loves that song more than any other song because that's what our message is believe believe what's coming your way and God will do it in your midst he says then if you're Abraham's seed you have this promise in you you believe God regardless of what takes place the Holy Ghost makes you believe it anyhow that's why you've got to have the Holy Ghost Church because you won't believe it you won't hold you won't stay steady in the times of trial and decisions and difficult times if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that's holding me we sing that song something keeps holding me it's the predestination of God that holds us but it's the power of the holy spirit that keeps us standing firm to the word of God in our day-to-day lives he says see the spirit that was upon Christ is upon the church because there's the bride and the groom and he took the spirit and said a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he says the spirit and the body is taken up that's what his Covenant was that's what it meant to take those animals and separate them and God walking in the midst he says you're going to be you're not even going to have anything to do with it you're just going to be sitting there and I'm going to do it now that doesn't mean we don't have a part to play but what he's saying is that your righteousness is not based on your actions it's based on me saying that you're righteous that you're pure that you're spotless that you're holy in all of these things amen God said I'm not going to lose one of them amen and how does he do it he rebirths them except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and he reverse you with a new nature that can now do the things of God and believe the things of God and expect the things of God Amen listen we come from something Eternal so he has to give us something Eternal to bring us back and that's what the holy spirit is in our lives is it's literally a portion of God's life stuck inside of you and guess what you don't need a lot of God to make it through just a little bit of God will take you through when we're talking about the Eternal omniscient unpowerful God just a little bit of God's enough to take us through amen listen we may not know now that you're a child of God you may not know it you may not but you you may not believe it you may not understand it but there's going to come a day if you're a child of God that you're going to know it and you're going to believe it and you're going to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you are not only a child but that you have received the Holy Ghost that you have been sealed with the Holy Ghost to the day of your Redemption and that you're going in a resurrection and you're going into Rapture no matter what comes that is what we need to get to a place to is that we know that we are a child of God Amen Paul said what search out your salvation with fear and trembling that doesn't mean be fearful but it says be careful that you've got what you say you've got go and make sure be certain of God be certain of the working of God in your life so that you know that you've got the Holy Ghost and that he's working in your life so that you can expect the other things of God to take forth in your life as you're moving forward amen remember we spoke in the last service about this this circumcision and God said listen I've given you a covenant but you've got to have something in you that represents that Covenant and he said in Genesis 17 he says this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and then we read that scripture where Paul says you've received a circumcision but it's not a circumcision of hands it's not a circumcision in uh that's made by by hands in your flesh but it was a it was what it was the baptism of the Holy Spirit he says you've had a working in your life that's taken away something something unnecessary and what was it it was your old nature it was your old life it was your old inclinations it was your natural heritage is what it was and he brought you back to a spiritual Heritage and something Supernatural had to change us because we're being restored to a supernatural position that's why a man can't do it that's why a church can't do it that's why a religion can't do it that's why the message itself can't do it but it has to be the person of the message stepping into your life and giving you a relationship and an experience with the person of this message amen otherwise we're no different than anybody else that's it we're a denomination without the Holy Spirit we're a denomination that's the flat truth and that goes for us individually not just as a church amen brother Brown would say this he says you are the Covenant people of God God tore Christ apart at Calvary making the Covenant and swearing by himself and he took the body up into heaven which will return someday but the spirit he gave back to lead the church the same life that was in Christ Jesus is in the church tonight by the Holy Ghost doing and acting and Performing the same things he did when he was here on Earth you'll notice with Christ he had to surrender himself first and then he did the Greater Works he had to go through the trials and the testing and then he did the Greater Works didn't he he had to pass the test with Satan he had to prove what was inside of him before he could go on and do those other things and we've got to do the same thing and the first thing the holy dose will do is he'll prove us to God and then God can use us and that's what adoption is we'll get into that in in future Services Lord willing he says you've received it you've got the Covenant it's written to you and swore by God you can't fail he says and that makes the devil mad it sure does when you realize who you are remember we said in that service that the greatest revelation we can have is who we are in Christ because that is what the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against as the revelation of Christ because the revelation of Christ includes you you're in him so when you get a revelation of who he is and where you are in him then the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that brother Brahm says listen Abraham had a sign in his body and it was a sign made by hands and a man had to do it and guess what I'm sure they had mess-ups and they had slip ups and the blade slipped and and people were disfigured in these different things but I love how brother Brown digs into this this Genesis 17 and he points to the working of God and he says but when God does circumcision it's perfect and it's complete and he says the reason it is is because it's God alone doing it it's God alone doing it remember we've shared that quote before where brother Braham says you don't go to a kid and say or a young person or whatever and you say you need to come up and give your life to God because mama wants you to or daddy wants you to or or or she died praying that you would come to the Lord in these things he says you don't put that pressure you don't put that influence on them because it'll bring a false birth but if you'll just let God do it his way without touching keeping your hands off of it you'll get genuine births every time because it'll be God that's calling him and not us putting pressure on them amen and then like I said it's not because we try it's because we surrender to the Potters the master Potter's hand amen and what is he doing he's taking us he's molding us he's directing us he's bringing us through trials and life he's bringing us through situations all to squeeze out and shape us into that thing that he wants ready for his use as adopted Sons and Daughters of God for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen what does that mean it's to literally be the manifested creative word of God in your age in your time according to what he said about you that's what we're going towards church it's the manifested what nature promises planned purpose of God all of them just flowing through your life on a daily basis listen I I think sometimes we think it's going to be some Grand thing and I believe there will be elements of it but when you look through the scriptures so much of it was just the day-to-day faithful walk that's it listen they didn't go around and every day have healing campaigns that wasn't an everyday thing it was an occasional thing and guess what they didn't always have euticus falling out of the window because the service went too long and them raising him from the dead and they weren't always having Peter released from jail miraculously through three squads of soldiers and closed Gates and all these different things that didn't happen all the time and we think that that's what it's going to be but what it's going to be is the overcoming humble simple Victorious Christian Life of the believer day in and day out with the works of God coming as the Holy Spirit quickens you to do them see we forget the day today because we want the supernatural forgetting that the the overcoming day-to-day is the Supernatural and if you're overcoming day to day then you'll overcome the big stuff as it steps in your way that's what we're looking for that's that's that's what I believe amen is that it doesn't always have to be a big mountain top it's just a continuous Walking with God listen the scripture says that Enoch walked with God he didn't run with God he didn't jog with God he didn't Trot with God he just walked with God and that's what's going to take us on this Earth it says brother Brown says he just kind of got to a day where he says I'd like to leave now and he just walked and God took him that simple listen if that's what happened with him that's the same thing that's going to happen to us amen we're going to walk I believe I don't know if brother Bram says that I've heard it over the pulpit but I believe it's something along the lines of that last step will be the shortest or the easiest because it'll just seem natural and I want to get into that just as we start to close here brother Branham would share this story about Sarah Abraham's wife and and I think it's fitting because I want to be what God wants me to be amen I want to be what the word says I am but I know that it's going to take a working of God in my life to take me all the way to that place amen it's going to take the supernatural I can't get there just by studying the word and by having devotions and praying that's not just what's going to do it God has to be there God has to be active in my life personally for these things to happen I need to be still and let him do the work but as we start to close I want to read these these last few quotes because we're talking about the the promise and then the the the the the actual happening of that promise he would say notice now here was Sarah she got old a little grandma and here was Abraham long white beard 100 years old the Bible said they were both well-stricken in age and the years before this Abraham fell on his face and laughed when he thought the very idea of him as an old man as old a man in his life had gone like he was to ever have a child by Sarah is that right he says now they were old both of them now we notice immediately after this when God made his Covenant or he showed to Abraham now this is not written he says in the scripture but read between the lines with me now when he showed to Abraham what he was going to do future he made a manifestation of it to the people to them present so he's preparing them for the supernatural but he does something in their midst right now to show that the supernatural was coming that the promise was coming right so they didn't have all right after God says I'm going to do it then that's when it started happening but it didn't really look like a child it looked like something else we meant they started changing so that they could have a child he's now now he told them he was going to bless them we know that God had to do something to the womb anyhow of Sarah didn't he she'd been Barren all these years nearly 100 years old and was Barren in order to do something to make this he had to recreate something in that woman's womb to make it fertile is that right in order to do that he had to stimulate her heart because she couldn't go into labor like that a woman 100 years old is that right she couldn't do it all right uh he says and another thing what about the milk veins he's saying Sarah's body had lost its ability to have a child Sarah had completely lost it Sarah never had it in the first place is the biggest point I want you to catch she never had strength to conceive in the first place so for her to have a child was a miracle in it of itself but now for her to conceive at 90 years old was going to be a completely different miracle and he's looking and he's describing Sarah's condition and it is impossible to produce the promise of God and that's what we are church it's impossible for us in our flesh to produce the child to produce the promise of God but watch what God what brother Brown says here God doesn't patch up anything you get into situations you get into life you get into relationships you get into problems and you get things and they break and they're God doesn't take that and put it back together God just says I'm going to give you something new you have a new life you have a new birth he throws away the old he doesn't patch it up and he gives you something completely new and he says this is what you need he said he made Sarah a new woman he made her a young beautiful woman again and he made Abraham a young man again he just turned them back to show what he's going to do in the Rapture to us oh you say brother Branham ridiculous he says all right we'll follow them a minute we know immediately after that they took a little trip and went down to Gerard the disobedient little young people is that right he says measure it on your map it's 300 and something Miles by camel quite a trip for an old couple like that Grandma here a little stick and a little Shaw here she comes and my Abraham come along 300 and something miles down the garage is that right the Bible said they went down there he says and you know the strange thing it was after little grandma and them coming down there and great great grandpa Abraham little on white beard little grandma with this little shawl on her the king of Gerard was looking for a sweetheart and all those beautiful women down there but when he sees Sarah he says there's the one I want little grandma with a shawl over her shoulder the most beautiful thing in the world there's the one I want he says ridiculous nonsense she wasn't a little Grandma God turned her back to a young beautiful woman again that's what he's going to do to every one of you in the Rapture yes sir he says and I can see her now if you'll give the next one I can see her now the king looking all around where them pretty girls were and when he saw Sarah he said there's the one I've waited for can you imagine a little Grandpa Grandma that's the one I've waited for I'll bet she never told him her age he says no she was a pretty girl turned back to around 25 years old something like that Abraham a young sturdy man again God showed him what he told him he was going to do what the Covenant is with you he says what he done to Sarah and Abraham he's going to do to you grandmother and you grandfather the same thing so in other words God said I told you I was going to do it and now I'm doing it and I'm preparing you to express the promise in your bodies this will be a supernatural event but the Supernatural part is that you'll be able to do it in the first place after that body change after that transformation you'll be in a condition to just do what you need to do to produce a child you'll want a child you'll be able to have a child you'll be able to birth a child you'll be able to nurse a child you'll be able to bring forth the promise but the supernatural was not what her body could do it was the body change that allowed her body to do it in the first place what he did was he changed her back so that she could naturally do because of a supernatural event that's all God's doing with us church when we take the next step it will be natural because he has supernaturally changed us to make it natural that's what we're looking at because if we're going in a rapture there are going to be steps of progression and guess what each step will feel natural doesn't mean it won't be uncomfortable doesn't mean it may not have some little issues that come with it listen Sarah because she had a new body didn't mean she didn't have birth pains but she had a body that could handle it she had the muscles to do it she had a heart that was strong enough to handle the labor she had everything built into her supernaturally to produce the promise of God not only that she wanted to do it and she was able to do it and her husband was able to do it with her because of the supernatural work of God in their lives to be able to do this amen that's why I say we need the Dynamics because all of the body is there and we just need the supernatural to make it do what it's supposed to do amen God made a covenant in Joel 2 28 that he would pour out his Spirit it was a promise I was waiting for hundreds of years dormant and then they went up in an upper room for 10 days and when they came out they said this is it this is that this is what we've been waiting for what was it God did the supernatural in their midst and they came out completely changed from when they went in up in that room completely changed and then the supernatural followed automatically automatically brother Brandon would say this the church has come through justification through Luther through sanctification through the methodists and now up to the time of the promise the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is Promised all through the Old Testament and New to the promise behold us and the promise of my father upon you Peter said that on the day of Pentecost that is the promise the promised land we're talking about our Promised Land the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world he says it's another land you have to come out of the conditions that you've been in to come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise he says remember the promise you shall receive power from on high after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you and Peter said that the promise that was made all down through the testament old and new he says you find promising on up to that day of Pentecost everything was pointing to that he says and then they entered into the promise and they had it and they got it and it's been available to us ever since and we point to that part we point to that time we point to that promise and say it's still here and it's here until it takes us all the way off this Earth in a Rapture and a resurrection amen last quote he says Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is the world that they came out of the Wilderness is where they were Sanctified a Sanctified called out Church Canaan is where they settled down with the holy spirit it's not just enough to have it he says you got to settle down with it he says because they still have wars and if you don't believe you have wars just get the Holy Spirit once what are you doing what do you do in Canaan he says they were possessing their rights Glory they were possessing their rights and they could not possess their rights until they got into Canaan he says they didn't know nothing in the wilderness then when they come into Canaan then they have rights he says and we've got rights when you receive the Holy Ghost during Canaan you have to fight for it every inch of ground you have to fight for it yes sir and then God bless you let's Stand Together amen that leads us into
