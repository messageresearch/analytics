when it comes to your life what's involved in your life you got it all surrendered to him and he's under easing control a man he controls no matter what it is do you have on your thoughts your heart your mind your spirit no matter what it is Jesus is in control amen you're gonna pass everything through him you're going to get his counsel you're gonna get his leadership his advice amen not my will father don't be done I'll tell you that's that's a strong statement that's a big statement because there's many things that we want to do we want to do this we want to do that when it comes to our natural natural means but I mean it's gonna let let let him make the decision amen now you but it's gonna let him make the decision well I'll tell you this there's so many too many believers during their live in their own lives oh no they're not live by the spirit they're led by the their there's human senses but again if you're the if you're the seed of God if you're the bride of Christ you're led by the spirit there's absolutely nothing that you're gonna make the decision a male it's him Lord what do you want me to do Lord where do you want me to go how do you want me to do it when do you want me to do it Lord amen sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God amen I don't care what it is it doesn't say oh it's just this it's just that it's just religion no no he's controlling your life amen and through his word his word is controlling your life not my will father time be done again not many are going to say it not me really really really got such control given over to the Lord but I pray that by the grace of God ministry to those that have given him control they may it your thoughts your words and your deeds is in his control amen and he's there to convict you when it comes to a wrong thought a wrong word or wrong deke the Holy Ghost would convict you amen as the power of God has highlighted the fact and he said that he that year of theophany is not 12 feet from you at any given time and the time that he'll pull away is if you see it and what does it do if we sin we have an advocate with the father but Sidney said doesn't doesn't change our relationship it just interrupts our fellowship a man but again the theophany withdrawal away but then when you repent he comes back again is conviction you repent you're back in fellowship again praise the name of the Lord to God be the glory a man it's a tremendous tremendous challenge to our faith and again to ask you to remember in prayer our brother rod sister Shirley snow they'll be returning from from the mainland on Monday so the help they'll be back here in Bishop falls on Monday so it'll be it'll be a different Bishop falls a man so God God bless our brother rod sister Shirley and their travel back

praise the name of the Lord Alleluia the glory day are already our Indonesian estimate to God be the glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Jesus now I believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you Jesus amen praise the Lord God bless just totally me to Revelation chapter 13 revelation 13 a man flattered brother onic made it and our brother Joshua rode on again his family lore blesses a man praying grace for those not able to make it tonight and the grace of God to those that did come and those that will and have to it deal with the weather outside as you go home tonight so the Lord blesses a man for the glory of God and in Revelation chapter 13 and beginning to read at verse 1 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy a man so we're not impressed with that we thank God for the revelation and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of the lion and the dragon gave him his power a man and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed amazing and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon amazing they worshipped the Dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshipped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him the world is deceived by the beasts and the dragon who is able to make war with him and whether it was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies just consider the power the authority that he had Amen so there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months or three and a half years and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name it's in this hour it's in this age we're dealing with the Beast we're dealing with the god of this world a man and it says he opened his mouth to bless in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name anything that was revealed in the mystery of the seals is the revelation of the name even our Lord Jesus Christ a mayor it is non Father Son and Holy Ghost but it is the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost amen so we pray God and thank God for the name anything God for sharing with us the name praise the Lord praise the Lord a man it was in the bridegroom now it's in the bride because the bride takes the name of the right girl praise the Lord so I trust that you feel honored that you're identified with the Lord Jesus Christ amen and then you can share his name even in water baptism a man in prayer you got the authority for the name a man to use the name and God will honor your request anything you ask in that name he said the father will do it praise the name of the Lord Alleluia we'll ask according to the will of God so again verse six and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and he did and his tablet and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all Kindred's and tongues and Nations brother the beast is going to control the world a mad once the bride goes out the Beast takes control amen and it says and power was given him over all Kindred's tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world If any man a venire let him hear god bless his words you may be seated again a confirmation of the god of this evil age a man that he that it's not a fairytale it is the fulfillment of the prophecy of the word that God has prophesied even in Revelation a man that that God is going to rise with Authority and power in the world a man so much that he's going to deceive if possible the very elect that's how closer it's going to be to the real a man God is going to be here God is going to be doing this God is going to be going to be revealing his word and the devil is going to be there impersonating what God is doing a man so we pray the grace of God to be with us that we're not going to be deceived amen the grace of God to be with us amen that we're going to stay with the truck we're to stay with the word we're going to stay with what God has revealed to us and when the enemy comes in amen yeah yeah God's read but but we're not going to listen to him a man will let the goats listen to him but those sheep and lambs we're not going to listen to him amen and again and as the warning is to the sheep and the Lambs to beware of the enemy when he comes because there's close it would deceive the very elect brother this is serious don't think because we're not in denomination well God brought us out and the rest of the world is be being deceived by denominations no it's going to be worse than that amen brother we're gonna work with others like it like I said I felt so bad when I was neatly at the altar that time years ago and anybody that might have been almost 50 years ago and there was there was a certain believer right next to me there and they were praying and they were saying oh lord I thank you for bringing us out of denominations and now Lord we don't have to be subject to any man and I said Lord forgive them I said they're not they're not acknowledging the truth of your word you brought a note from there and you bring them under the under whole yeah under the authority of man I said even a prophet a man there they got to be subject to the Prophet and now for the ministry of the Prophet you had to be serving to a 5-volt ministry why because the Prophet said no he said you young ministers he says you're ordained to take this message on to the coming of the Lord a man so both of the Prophet is not here but again brother our emphasis is not on William Branham William Branham William Branham it not just on profit profit profit now it's on Christ in the bride and the bride in Christ amen because he has come down he revealed himself through the prophetic ministry and what what is he doing he's entered into a oneness with his bride he is Kali his bride a man he redeemed her now he has come down to get her a man and he's going to take her home so though brother sister the emphasis on Christ with you Christ in us Christ the bride he has entered into become one with us because the bride and the bridegroom become one by the grace of God and brother I tell you sir we're going back and just putting the emphasis on the Prophet and all William Branham will around we're not enter into a oneness with Jesus brother so we got to move on and I tell you this when the man wouldn't want to do that not by any means because just like when they went at that time when we're in Bantam went to the pulpit and this brother came over and he and he put a note in William brother's pocket and brother Ram before he got to the Pope took a took the no doubt any read it and he said william branham is my lord well then i guess in a sense they might have shocked with their brain them but when he got up to preach before he preached and he said now he said i want to do i want to make the note of this and he said her brother just put it in my pocket a many now of course he knew it was and at the time their brother was was in the room there and he was recording the sermon exactly and brother brown said when brother brows that i'm going to preach on this their brother even changed the title a man oh yeah he changed the title due to line up with with the way that he believed it but the part of God said this and so on so I like that some other time to you concerning the title but brother Brown said listen he said don't you do this he said if you do this again he said I'll leave the ministry and he said I just had to leave it and I want one preach no more he said because he said why he said because this is anti grace a man and brother that all my brothers sister if it was Antichrist then how much more genetic race now a man because they're Bobbitt is gone and he went on so the only one now that we had to do with his Christ in the revealed Word a million and so brother a who was Antichrist vanna said of Christ now he says you're making me and a crisis what he's saying so brother sister there there's many a believer today still making William Branham Antichrist and they're becoming Antichrist themselves a man because why because they're not putting the emphasis on the revealed word coming through the ministry but it just exudes are still back there you know fifty years or fifty five years with the Prophet they're still back there back here 1965 when that message was preached they're back there maybe 1963 or 1961 those messages were preached brother we gotta get into the revelation although those messages for the day a man brother they meant one thing back there but now that needs something else is absolute truth brother well yeah the problem of gods that I he said I know it's not striking you the way that it should that was 55 years ago he says not striking me the way that it should why because it wasn't coming to fulfillment but now with you and me this message here on the god of this evil age brother and now now we see it in a greater way than they saw it over 50 years ago we see it in a greater way than they saw it 40 years ago brother sister way because now we're seeing the god of this evil age a may reveal himself more we see his influence among the people more in this hour and they say then we did 40 years ago we see his influence among them even more now than we did even 20 years ago I can I can I can vindicate that I can prove that a man brother sister after after being around this message in this message than I trust the message in me for over 50 years brother I know what was going on 50 years ago I know what was going on at 45 years ago 40 and 30 years ago I know the spirit that was on the people I know the auntie tree that was in the people ain't bad they're brothers they now know yet the whole thing is changing completely amen brother it's not the same spirit not the same Adoni that it was revenge that it was 40 or 50 years ago a million brother I'm dealing with a lot different spirits now than I did then amen brother we're duty we with our spirit back then as well but we're trying to get the people more at a denomination more away from that get away get away get more into the word get more into the word a man moving away from within brown lorry into the word so they will know what God has done what God is doing and what God will do a man we do what God did amen 55 years ago in the message of the Prophet but and we then we were getting into what he was doing fifty years ago and forty years ago and thirty years ago but brother after 1977 we had to start getting into what he do what he's going to do a man and brother they're dead what he was going to do he's doing now I know it's the present tense again God bringing us out of the future out of the past into the present brother to get us into the present tense revelation of what he is doing a man there were the present tense revelation of what he was doing 40 50 years ago 30 years ago 8 million but after 1977 brother the anointing was changing on the bride hey babe and when we will begin to what because we started to get into the word we started to get into the message a man and Christ was beginning to take is right and our lady can bring us into a revelation of Resurrection and rattray faith a man because the part of God said that that's what the that's the mystery of the of the seven seals that is the mystery of what God was doing in his ministry a man it was the revelation of the word to give the bride brought through faith a man brother but again we didn't get into that we weren't seeing that we want to get where they getting that understanding for you know 50 years ago 40 years ago or 30 years ago but again you by 19 and 77 that is when believers started again into the to the word believer started to get into the message they were they believed God's on a prophet but they began to focus not on the profit but they begin to focus on the message amen brother for many years many many years we were all preaching goddess and a prophet goddess and a private goddess and a brother unfortunately they're still those who are focusing on that revelation God has sent a prophet anybody but brother we got to get out of that and we got to get into voice or the prophet and so that God is going to start making it manifesting you and me why should whatever what he going to go through the Prophet well God is doing that he you and me God is fulfilling it in you and me all right you wanted to know why God sent a prophet watch what he's doing in the bride a man what he's doing in there that's what he said the profit so now we're not going to say it's not going to go around the world preaching goddess and a prophet we're going to start preaching why should the Prophet amen they get us out of that and into the resurrection out of that into the rapture amen praise the name of the Lord see brother sisters just like our brother Luther there and Wesley and all the others have been accost ones they they were moving God did this God did that God did that but eventually it all became past tense amen it was past tense a way to move on to something else see it's like it's like a lot of a of the Pentecostals and Abele though oh praise the Lord praise the Lord and the anointing began to move away oh yeah the emphasis on the gifts and you know at the bachelors were the Holy Ghost are speaking of John's and it began to go down down down a lot of the old fashioned Pentecostals they were wondering well Lord what is next because the anointing is not not not in the Pentecostal message now like it used to be so Lord what are you going to do next so they many of them believe they made they they door was right what they were thinking those old-fashioned ones they were right but they never recognized that when God was doing it they believe a man that the crowning of the event acosta message would be the coming of the Lord that's the truth oh yeah and the Prophet himself even even they even mention it and he should always show the panic all semester people issue they believe that years ago amen but they've when God fulfilled it in the Ministry of Malachi for a million praise the name of the Lord they never recognized that it was Christ coming down to receive his bride amen Christ coming down to get his brain Christ coming down to anoint his brain now with the Pentecostal and 80 yes that yes and he anointed the bride with when Luther Wesley Pentecost amen but he was going to crown it amen whether with a message that would give the bride resurrection and Raftery faith to take us into glory amen but the old fashioned Pentecostals of course they went off the scene and they were there they weren't here to recognize it they weren't here to be part of it hey man they they boy God ordained him to do a man that God was raised in another generation a man in this hour this age to fulfill what he wants to do that he can come and live in you and live in me and what and manifest the resurrection in the rapture praise the Lord hallelujah brother God is not just looking to to manifest luther's through a message or Wesley's message or the Pentecostal message now in a small he's done it the world has been the world has been given a witness the world will be given the testimony of justification say to vacation the baptism of the Holy Ghost but brother the thing that they're that they're looking for they're not looking for the thing that they need to get into now is the resurrection of the rapture they need to get into the revelation that is giving us the faith the revelation of the Resurrection and the rapture what God is doing how God is doing it amen Oh a thing with it oh yeah well you know after a while there's got a couple of Resurrection and this is going to happen come a resurrection that's going to happen though reading any and concerning the oh yeah it was on my Matthew Matthew and Reese's commentaries and so on concerning the hour that you and I are living and and he was pointing to the resurrection but they a brother either the revelation that he had was the revelation of Pentecostal say the Luther had Wesley had amen but brother garner took us on into the into the Ministry of Malachi for and the opening of the seven seals the mystery of God amen to give us a revelation of the coming of the Lord the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen but our brother Matthew Andrea and God bless him a man because our brother Branham he had Matthew in his commentaries even in his library and when I when I was there a man in his home in Tucson I saw it it was there a man he didn't agree with my mother math you want everything but a lot of things he did but matter in he was pointing to the resurrection you're playing to the rapture the same way that Luther a Wesley the Pentecostals believe that the resurrection was coming they believe in the rapture was coming a man exactly like I said that I had a book I don't know they still got it or not by a certain church not a messy church and and then a picture there of the resurrection of the rapture and I said Lord I said that was according to the revelation that they had I said maybe a hundred years ago but I said we're gone beyond that now and then the picture of the resurrection a man and the rapture only the picture a painting rather you know a like in a graveyard and they were looking up and there was Jesus coming down and oh my ear was the graves opening up in the painting the graves were open and here it was Grandma and Grandpa coming up and it was mom and dad coming up and it was this this just just baby coming up that baby and this distance is a boy and this girl at a certain age and they were all coming at it out of the graves and they were going off to meet Jesus well brother there's no there's no infant up days neither an old man that has not fulfilled these days hey man no no no we're not going into these bodies are going to be changed we're going where they're gonna be young men and women we're gonna maybe you might be around 20 years old 21 years old amen but there's not gonna be all my brothers Chester the old will be young they're forever a man transformed in a moment of time immortal will stand in his likeness them yeah the Sun of the stars to outshine a man because way old age is a is rizal of said a man but I believe when Adam and he was in the garden there there was never no aging no no there's no a age didn't take effect when it comes to Adam and he until after the sin amen and they got out of the presence of God but in the presence of God were young men and women that's right we're we're exactly sons and daughters of God amen praise the name of the Lord amen so god help us whether to recognize it and again to understand this brother that's not the resurrection that's not the rapture amen brother a win ended hey man brother why come out of the way come out of the grave in a cemetery the Bible said dust so our door shut their return amen because why because we're gonna receive a new body a glorified body amen brother he curse he cursed the natural body after man failed and he said Dussehra did I show they returned and brother he cursed a servant he cursed the woman a man personally but when he got demand he cursed the earth a man the ground and so on and he said you will labor for this you will labor for that and so on but he said dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return hey babe so brother sister the resurrection rapture brother agree we're going out of here and we're going into the theophany body brother listen well I tell you they in the Mount of Transfiguration they're in the matter of where were Jesus went up yeah and and he met Moses and Elijah well where did Moses and Elijah come from yeah where did this one come and where devil come from amen praise the name of the Lord and brother you go beyond the curtain of time the probably God went there this bravas went there Saints went there they saw beyond the curtain of time amen but the only only saw young men and women amen because you went back into a theophany body a man and it's a theater does the Omni buddy you reflect you to see it as a young man are you going brother if you know each other here you'll know each other there amen you're gonna wreck it you're ill huh it'll be by grace amen by grace that when we get over there we're gonna recognize a sister coffee amen that she's gonna be a young woman hey man we're recognized sister Dunford not 95 years old not by any means that's the result of said result of the curse dust art and unto dust shalt thou return they would go this way go that way and so on but when God raised them up a man they're young men and women a man so brothers sister the when it comes to the Pentecostals and all the rational people were this kind of a resurrection that kind of a resurrection all know that mom oh no dad because they'll be you know this uh this old and that old know they're gonna be eternal sons and daughters of God amen by the grace of God but what the crowning of the of all the messages the crying of all that God has done and God is dead was the was Malachi for the crying is the calling out of the bride for the resurrection and the rapture amen to give us a revelation of the resurrection that that is not going to be like that it's not gonna be like that it's gonna be like this amen amen brother there's like I when I go by a graveyard I had someone a solid somebody has asked me you know what maybe a couple of times you know how many is dead there in the graveyard and I said how many well I said they're all dead I said because if they weren't dead they won't be there I said when it comes to physically they're all dead but I said how many I said is still alive in a theophany body somewhere I don't know but again when when Lazarus died he rose in what they called the bosom of Abraham and when the rich man died he rose in in in the fire oh yeah so he oh my brother just think during a place of torment do use it in a place of peace or a place of torment Amen sir brother sister God pointed us to it in Luther and Wesley point of that generation and the Pentecostals you have plenty us through the resurrection players to the rapture but a mother was in this hour it was the crowning of the Pentecostal message with the revelation of how God was going to bring the resurrection in the rapture amen how is God going to do it brother I pray grace that we're now we're not just going on to the resurrection like they were when I going on to the resurrection I knew there are the Pentecostals but Brennan revelation of the resurrection Edea to the revelation of the rapture a man brother in the neighborhood audience on nd York asunder by a man oh brother you're talking in tongues yeah I don't know if you read the devotion in in our brothers gods book within the last couple of days but the problem of God was there and there somebody was praying and at the same time another brother was speaking in tongues amen and the rod of God said I think that brother he said for speaking in tongues and he said he was interpreting what the brother was saying was praying a man because this the Holy Ghost we can't at her but only ghost can he spit the Roman roamin says he speaks in this language amen and as her brother was praying out for brother Branham or somebody or brother round pray for somebody else this brother spoke in tongues yeah brother Brown says thank you god bless you amen so that was good amen so brother God is God is amen interpreting his word God is revealing his word God is pressing upon us what he wants us to hear and what he wants us to be late brother God is pressing upon us what he wants to make flesh in us amen so that will believe the word on the inside the inside to the extent that we become one with it anybody and God is going to work it out by the grace of God God is making they making it as it were flesh and us the revelation of the resurrection amen amen praise the Lord no wonder the prophet of God said he said the dead are waiting on us amen when you look for to come to that revelation amen amen amen as Jesus was talking to Mary Martha and concerning Lazarus her brother that was dead and Annie's release and I am the eel rides again oh yes she said he'll rise up there yeah in the resurrection in the future yeah jesus said I am the resurrection amen he said believe us now this a man brother she didn't have the weight for the resurrection up there so there are 2000 years away he was right there we hooray for the resurrection up there the resurrection is in us the resurrection is with us because he said then he said I am the resurrection a man and brother he's the resurrection tell me that he proved he was the rapture a man because he didn't know when he come up and bring that body back up again he went near Oxford it he did 2,000 years ago he went up in a rapture he came back in the Holy Ghost amen to reveal himself in his break until he would come again to the full revelation of the Resurrection and the full revelation of the rapture anyway and that site is going to be made first in his break they managed to bring the resurrection and the rapture that's why the dead in Christ are waiting on us do you have the revelation of the resurrection oh yeah it's up there no he's made flesh in the bride don't you see don't you recognize what he did in Malachi 4 don't you recognize what he did in will in Rose ministry amen the public God constantly said and he said listen he said this was not means and I can't do this and because he was deserting the thoughts and intents of the heart and he was you know any USAO thus saith the lord you're healed thus said the Lord thus saith the Lord and there are doers two or three people there one time in church had died but they came back to life he raised him again well because the resurrection of the rapture what he wasn't William Branham wasn't it was Christ in him it was that ministry that was in control and brother amen it was the ministry that is in the bride and he was revealing himself in the prophetic ministry to let us know easier oh not just William Branham William Branham we don't read no it's too bright mister believers exactly that's why he wanted to get the people to believe a man by the grace of Almighty God and he would see the audience this way you City on is that way and he would say he would see the the pillar of fire or he would see the light and some places there do you see darkness why because I'm belief but he was what he was looking for faith any man and brother there was faith there pulley on the anointing they were pulling on the gift they were pulling on what what God was revealing through this man called William Branham but he said he got out of the way so Jesus could do what he want to do amen whether they recognize Jesus in in what he was doing the recognize Jesus absolute truth there there were many many evangelists and many Pentecostals many many so others remain on denominations back there that day they they saw this is God this is God this shouldn't Lord you this is exactly what you did 2,000 years ago but they not acknowledge that but they couldn't make knowledge the truth that he was preaching no they said how do we how do we reconcile into this sign how do we reconcile this ministry with what what the man is preaching they couldn't do it amen because he was going beyond Pentecost beyond though they're beyond Wesley he was going beyond denominations he was going into the revealed word amen but brother I tell the bride recognized it they recognized it was gone amen I pray grace that we recognize it was God it was crates coming down with resurrection around through faith and that's why again that the daily Christ are waiting on us and he said God is waiting on us just to many believers so called waiting on God that is the absolute truth they're waiting for God do this one God to do that and God has given us the word for us to do it came and God has given us the word to give the bride the faith to do it amen Martha believe us know this he said I am the resurrection if he was then he is now well if he was then how much more is he now he proved it then and now he's come back to resurrect the bride and rapture the brain amen amen the bride is the resurrection and the rapture hey man praise the name of the old or held us so let go and let God have his way others there they go of old thoughts and all ideas and old theology and Lord let's get into the new revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ that the resurrection the rapture is in us sure he redeemed us spiritually in our souls as I said before you had the reserve as he quickened you as a resurrected who were dead in sins and trespasses and we have been caught up in devil II places in Christ and again the prophecy what's going on there in every places he said the word is being revealed Amen well what's been revealed to you and me the water of the other ages a man who was revealed in Wesley's age pen Luther's Asia the Pentecostal age any man and look what look what God did in them and through them brother for gone beyond Pentecost or what's God doing now it's finished now my God have mercy on us please lord have mercy on us don't let us miss it Lauren don't let us miss the resurrection don't let us miss the rapture oh my lord help us to live in the spirit walk in the spirit a man and to believe that Lord that you are the resurrection in the rapture he said I am he said believe us though this brother he was going to raise Lazarus from the dead and he did very bad so in this hour this age he's going to raise the bride a man couldn't not bring her out of their graves he's going to bring her from that dirty in that dimension oh yeah there is in that dimension in the theophany bodies but they're waiting for the resurrection and the rapture when a man when all the dead in Christ is a word or dead in Christ yeah they're dead to the world and the things of the world a certain Church's teaching oh yeah well you're dead you're that's it you're you're totally unconscious and you don't know anything that's going on I should wait a minute I said there are those the dead does know what's going on amen we're brothers I said sister I see the thing of it is they don't know what's going on in this world a man no no I said they've gone on to another dimension so that's why the Bible says those that are dead they know not anything period I said but don't let don't stop there I should go on ice to do a few more verses and maybe a few more chapters then you'll understand they don't know anything about this world a man but they know where they are the rich man lifted up his eyes in Hell being in torment a man Lazarus that was was the rich man saw Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham and oh they made fun of that when I told him and they saw Abraham's Muslim must be some big I said but oh yeah oh all the day we went to a proposal I said it is big I said what was this Muslim I said was his faith amen amen so brother it was we got a golf looking for that faith in you and me that he found in Abraham hey so what we're gonna we're gonna go on into as it were to the bosom of Abraham what's in his bosom I said his heart a man was in his heart I said his faith for God sees a man but you're saying that they they put in a literal interpretation to the scriptures they probably want a little I mean a physical interpretation all the dead don't know anything that's it period no yes the devil he's hiding their true why did the trunk he's hiding from them the revelation that they need about the resurrection the revelation they made about the rapture as he was ideate from that rich man and Jesus said you know you got to do this do some distance at all he didn't wanna do that he believed God yeah he kept the commandments from his youth like I said how many of us can say that you know we've no made no mistakes we didn't do this we didn't do that oh my goodness but how many feel like the rich man to be righteous but he was self-righteous Amen just think he lifted up his eyes until and there was Lazarus the beggar easy of the bosom of Abraham hey babe we're think he is today waiting for the resurrection waiting on you weenie on me sister coffee's waiting on our sister Dunford waiting on us amen the brothers and sisters that are gone on are waiting on us a man there's like my screensaver that I got on the computer there and everyone's want to look at it and I noticed all brothers sister burns brothers there's a menu sisters owns a brothers own so I said Oh Lord I said they're waiting on us hey man those that we have fellowship with you for years and they've been gone for years amen when I come to the word they were in the 40s a man when they got into their 70s and 80s they went on some of them went into their 90's and their God yeah but they're waiting on us come on go waiting on you come on their way yo yo to come to resurrection and rupturing faith come on we already know we got to take you serious we gotta take you serious if God were to come and physically and say look I want you to go do this and once I go do that yeah oh we wish okay all I'll do it Lord you know Eve if somebody comes you're like your job you're they tell you to do this to do this like like the young people here and you're your parents you tell you do this you're gonna do this you're gonna do that yeah well all right are we doing what God wants us to do are we really doing what God wants us to do are you just waiting for God to do it I'll tell you this most believers are so called are waiting for God to do it why because they're under the influence of the god of this evil age under the influence of the devil oh yeah yes God said concerning the resurrection yeah God said concerning the rapture but you just gotta wait oh oh thank you yes I fear I feel the same way no you say get behind me Satan I'm claiming the resurrection now I claim in the rapture now name of Jesus brothers sister if we don't take that right attitude right spirit if we don't let that revelation should take control of us we're gonna be left like I said grace that we're not gonna be here to ask the question I thought there was to be a rapture oh it already happening you didn't know what now I tell you that brother the vast majority of believers around the world are gonna be left to ask that question short yes if the part of God said over 50 years ago someone said brother Ben and what would you do if God asks you to pick a Debray you know for the rapture he said it always said I might find a dozen what if it was like that over 55 when 55 years ago what it would be today because people are more caught up with the world the things of the world today than they were then at least they were more spiritually not religious spiritual and again another time the Father God said there might be 200 there might be 500 yeah and he caught it down to one in a million not many is a that's why you got to be on your guard that's why you got to make sure you're in the spirit well make your calling and election sure how do you do that make sure you're in the end they in the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is eating you a man and a man and that you're led by the Holy Ghost are not led by your own feelings you're not led by this up here curse it be those thoughts amen because this up here is all based on human feelings a man but the bride she lives by faith in the heart and that's based on the revelation of the will of God what is God's will for your life amen what does God want you are you doing what God wants you to do amen what he wants you to do when he wants you to do it where he want you to do it he meant by the grace of God it's got to be there by the predestinated plan and purpose and will of God a man she was that why our sisters are here from the from America a man believing that is to be destinated planned purpose of God now why in the world would God bring you from there to a place called new feeling or Newfoundland with its own dictionary its own language yeah amazing because as I said for years Newfoundland for years Newfoundland was just a to Canada Newfoundland was a joke oh yeah we were just jokes you know people did express those thanks to me when I've been on the mainland and so on it's changed changes but for years it was that so god what is what is God doing amen did God ordained have predestinate us to do what we've done and what we're doing not just to the to the the William Branham homepage online there's been there for so many many many years since 1995 I believe it was yeah now what's God doing does God want us to to move forward take preeminence in the resurrection in the rapture hey man God's got someone somewhere brother God has called us out God calls us head for a purpose and I prayed more than just being a witness of what God has done brother let's be let's pray that God by grace is able to do what he wants to do when it comes to the resurrection rapture he's able to do in you and me yeah and also our brothers and sisters here from Africa yeah as I said before I never never ever dreamed I'd be ministering to to it to black or brother Brown would call you brown yeah black brothers and sisters no but it brother let's believe that God is in it God predestinated God for Damien amen we're this our brother of India over or the brothers and sisters from Africa Amy this is old brother this is unbelievable all this is just we're living it no well if the world we're living in God is in that world God is in control brother I pray grace that God is controlling you and me not the god of this evil age but the god of creation is controlling you and me amen what we do what we do when we do it where we do it how we do it Amen not my oh my oh my or my not my will die be done grace grace grace sorry oh no ok 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 in the message the god of this he believes the Prophet referenced 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse one praise the Lord now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and the word for the coming is parousia the presence we beseech you brethren by the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ by our gathering together unto Him amen and the bride has been gathered around the revealed word revealing the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ we are gathered together unto Him not to Allah Branham not to brother journal not you at this Ministry of that ministry but it is the Lord Jesus Christ that ye be not soon shaken in mind yes a man or be troubled neither by spirit don't be soon shaken in your mind don't you be troubled by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us Amen as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition and if any revelation that we are seen in this hour and this age I trusted that the brightest seen it for sure amen not just all believers but the bride is seeing the god of this evil age oh yeah we're seeing the influence of the god of this evil age oh yeah by looking back over 50 odd years I can see the influence of the this evil age most definitely a man and he said let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God and he's the god of this evil age oh yeah she I preached on it years ago on the five I wills of the devil it's found in Isaiah he said I will I will I will I will be like the Most High yeah and there are those that are worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping Christ why he is so close that he would deceive the very elect if possible and brother that's the very elect what about the others they're not very elect they're they're trying to identify as very late but they're deceived God had mercy and it says that he sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God remember ye not that when I was with you I told you these things and now he know what with older that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way amen and then show that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume a man whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming in these last days amen even him who is he going to destroy even him whose coming or again it's parousia presence whose presence is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders a man such as the deception consider it the power of God in preaching this god of this evil age he references second Thessalonians yeah such as the deception and it says even in whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and he said with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not didn't say to receive not the truth they received not the love of the truth well they're identified as all of them identified as believers but they don't love it God help us where is divine love do you have divine love in your heart in your soul for the truth they do truly sincerely like Jesus did yes like the apostle's like the prophets you too love the word all my anything I love is the word Amen anything we love is the reveal word amen but it says they perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved if there's anything that God's looking for is love divine love is love that shows us God in you if you got Islam Amen because you go to first Corinthians 13 again this is absolutely amazing you can have all the mysteries you can understand this understand that you could do this and do this amen but if you don't have divine law all in vain well we might think we're doing something good all we're building ourselves up you know spiritually but again if you don't have divine love you're not you you got the you got the letter of the word you got the dynamics of the mechanics of the word but not the dynamics the dynamics is divine love a man can love projects grace grace faith a man so anything in God's looking for in the revelation of his word in the revelation of your your testimony your light it's divine love oh yeah no matter much why I believe the word I believe the message yes so does the devil but he don't have divine law and he seed don't had divine law his children don't have divine love they might ever love but not divine laws or the prophet of God said that or said you can have love he said but it's easy it's just just ordinary common he says not divine Anthony got divine look my God have mercy I told you there's not much love today as it was 30 years ago not love today as it was 50 years ago no not by any means the love is not therefore the word the love is not therefore for the sons and daughters of God no not like it was what like I said when I first come to this word this message is this amazing so different now that people are too net too natural yeah they're just you just ordinary humans but not only go Schumann's if your Holy Ghost you got the Holy Ghost in yarn you got the love of God in your heart and you got the love of God in your heart to know you there's no way of preventing it from coming out it's just so automatic anyway it controls you it's the life you live amen you've been born again and the proof is his love in you in your heart your soul not oh I believe the message oh yeah I believe that I believe that yeah so does the devil and brother the devil II do see deeds thinking that he loved her and he was concerned for her oh yeah yeah yes God said he said but God God don't want you to know this God don't want to know that you know and he deceived even to thinking that he was concerned for her no he wasn't oh brother god help us God Elvis we should see her sincere and really genuine in her relationship with God genuine in our relationship with one another that is eternal and is motivated by divine love grace now grace sure brother the deceit is great the deceit is tremendous amen so much said it would deceive the very elect if possible but because you're filled with the divine love of God and the power of God the anointing of God it won't deceive you completely oh yeah you use maybe be just you might end up under the influence for a while but then it'll strike something in your heart you know that's not the Lord Lord you're not in that that's the god of this world that Oh Lord forgive me and you'll turn on you you'll repent you go on you won't be deceived you will not be deceived amen and it says then sure that wicked be revealed verse eight whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now the previous verses shows you how close he is to the elect how close he is to the real revelation of God Amen that a as far as the world's concerned he is God but he's not but when the Lord comes he's going to be destroyed that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and to destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming her presence is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth love love love God is love anything God expects to find any not expects to find any sons and daughters is love because it's cause nature and if that's your nature you're gonna make you it you know you again I do you have the nature of your natural mother and father whose nature do you have there's there are certain family people that we know also that's dead well that's mom they got that dad's attitude they got mom's attitude and spirit oh yeah do we have the attitude and the spirit the anointing of our Heavenly Father if we're born again we will have his nature and we'll definitely have these law if God is law his sons and daughters are love amen Christa it's a challenge to what we do and how we do it it's a challenge one younger to everyday living is a challenge to our our reaction to all that we experience in this life amen brother it's like is and it's like the the brother at one time when brother BAM was taken off the earth oh yeah and it was a Catholic bishop I think it was and he said he was he was interviewed in a local paper that they were reporting the death of William Brennan and Shawn I got the paper copied the paper home and and the interview this this Catholic bishop were somebody and they and he said listen if you if you've met William Branham he says one thing you knew he loves you he said II ad love ent fine now oh yeah amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so brother let's make sure that we every saved the love of the truth now when I just think oh thank you lord I thank you I'm glad you got I glad I got this truth do you love it do you love the truth because it's the revelation of God oh well it's the message no no it's God the message is God God is the message it's Christ should heal are you to love the messages to love him amen Oh too many in it because all of thank God i I got I used to see I can see this I understand that yeah so does the devil but make our calling and our election sure that we have divine love from our hearts amen and it says even him whose coming is after the working of Satan he's gonna be destroyed with all power signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved yeah amazing salvation is receiving the love of the truth amen for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness amen and pleasure in unrighteousness or apostasy a man not the true Holy Ghost revelation of the word but a false interpretation thereof a man should they had pleasure in such unrighteousness it is unrighteous we god amen grace of God bear with me I'll try Oh Matthew but the time' grace didn't realize there was this long i'll just give you a couple of quotes again just as your natural life your natural traits is ended down from the natural bleeding or breeding rather of your father so is the Spirit of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world and when the entire Word of God he said incomplete was added up and an human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him amen he laid down his life for us Jesus he said then he raised me up with him in the resurrection praise the Lord if I died with him I raised up again with him amen and now we are seated with him he said with power and authority over every devil Amen oh yeah you got the power you got the authority over Satan and all of his demons all he said if you could only believe he said what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there he said don't believe and are afraid to move he said you'll never use it but he said if you are seated you will use it if you're seated in Christ you're going to use that word and he said for you are ordained to do what you do by brother the thing of it is the natural traits and more preeminent sometimes in the spiritual people are more caught up with their natural feelings and and and wishes and desires than the spiritual father we got by grace a man to surrender to the leadership of the Holy Ghost because when the devil is going to move in the natural the Holy Ghost is going to move in the spiritual get behind me Satan a man you need to use that thought sometimes a thought in your mind because Satan is working in the mind a man make sure you got the word to give the devil a minute knowing that Rex you know would make sure you got the revelation so that you'll know when when it's Satan him and when it's not God because a lot of people you know Satan is there and they think well it's God know you better be careful so closer to see the very like that possible oh yeah he's gonna be dropping thoughts in your head and he's gonna try to get down what's he trying to do control your spirit and then to control it control your soul but if you're born again for Satan out of the soul code we're born in sin well God comes in and a man if our Satan out of the soul a man grace of God and he take what it is and he said he's on the throne in yourself yeah and Satan is there oh yeah then he controls your spirit then he's trying to influence you in your soul but if it's the devil the Spirit is gonna come with the word out of your soul get behind me Satan any man brother let's be careful my grace he said notice how beautiful the scripture tied themselves together in every age the scripture is tied together in every age word to word the word to finally if the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the bright it was all the word down through the prophets and in Christ if the fullness of the Word made flesh to redeem us spiritually a man but now it goes onward onward onward to now it's the word in us a man to redeem us physically amen he came and we were born to gain insight now he's going to come and give us a new body by the grace of God amen so he said notice how beautiful the scripture tie them sounds like in every age and he should notice now he said in the church world he said would not have the Word of God to rule over them will we have the word to rule over us concerning you concerning your your your life your relationship with others your job no matter what it is is the word in control he said the word to rule over them the Word of God and they accepted a murderer they would not have the word in Jesus day he said they accepted a murderer Barabbas and he said what did this do it exalted Satan the god of this evil age exalted him to the place that he's always wanted now he said listen for Satan is not spoke of as a God of any other age but this age and he was a spoke of the god of the age of Noah and he said he wasn't a smoke of the god of the age of Moses or the age of Elijah but this evil age he said don't miss it he said he is the god of this evil age worshipped now listen who are the people worshiping he is the god of this evil age he said worshipped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it they think they're worshipping Jehovah but they're worshipping Satan thinking that E is God such as his deception yeah just think about the one that betrayed Jesus Judas just thinking about the one that betrayed Jesus brother and in in the in the in the scriptures the Matthew Mark Luke and John we took we find nothing negative vote about him own only the worry to save Jesus he betrayed Jesus until disciples didn't know she was Thomas so close to had deceived the very light well he was there he was part of the part of the disciples Jesus anointed the disciples the glutton pray and heal the sick raise the dead and they all come back and says oh yeah we did this we did that and again there's nothing negative about you Judas nothing anywho when Jesus said one of you bid will betray me they were me is it me Lord is it me see it was so close and Jesus said well he said it's gonna be this person then Jesus turned to Judas and he's nice what you do do quickly no and there wasn't there was nothing negative about the relationship Jesus told him what to do there wasn't an anointing there before he got up and left and went and did it but it's amazing that he was interred in to enter into it that he was just he was deceiving there all the other disciples this is absolutely amazing and again it's proving what the scriptures that were reading is proving what the proud of God is talking about the God of this evil age it's so close who had deceived a very elect impossible no doubt the disciples were surprised we would think maybe would be Peter I like what brother brother George Smith brought out and we look forward to our brother coming back and finishing this sermon on Acts the book of Acts he finished with acts 18 I think a man and he was talking about Paul that God chose Paul as the messenger yet Paul was guilty of killing Christians imprisoning Christians oh yeah and yet he was he was he was the son of God amazing yeah he was the Messenger of God he was the messenger to the aged brother and we would consider well Lord after all we read in the Bible but Peter and you chose him to be the messenger of the day of Pentecost yeah he was the one God chose and yet went and you wouldn't when Jesus was fellowship with Peter at one point there Jesus Peter made a remark and Jesus said get thee behind me Satan yeah and even after the resurrection Jesus came back Peter lovest thou me more than these three times he was challenging Peters relationship with him yeah we had would he challenge yours mine god help us listen he says Satan is not spoke of as the God of any other age but this age and he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of Noah or Moses or Elijah don't miss it he is the god of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it yeah he's he's worshiped by Jews Christians Muslims cetera all other faiths and religions is Satan notices to Satan not called the God of any other age but this age it was his ambition to be like God from the very beginning a man he goes didn't want to go in some scriptures and he said are there fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning however cast down to the ground which did weaken the nation's for thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and I was set also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sight of the door yeah I will I will I will they may be like God and he would be worshipped as God and he is thank God for the revelation to be on our guard amen he said it was Satan's ambition to be worshipped play God and he took two-thirds of the stars of heaven ascended himself above the stars preached to them and seen two-thirds of them and now he's ready with his careful selected educated bride by his own knowledge all painted up in his deceit of big buildings big denominations paints of knowledge theology smart intellectual educated to deceive the whole and become a god that's what he's done all heading up into the person of the Antichrist which has already cloned the Vicar of God by his worldly loving scientific bride all dressed up in pop of intellectual religious education amen grace grace grace I'll finish it right there with this he mentions second Thessalonians 2 what we just read he said notice they are they the people exalt him above all that's called God they exalted the devil and he said doesn't he says 2nd Thessalonians say they would do it and the authority of a denominational church the people believing these are their denomination more than they believe God and God is the word but they'll believe their denominational Creed above the word which exalts him above all that's called God and there's only one God that's the word all that's called God so he as God is sitting in the Church of God proving that he is God because he got the people worshiping him amen and that says God is the word but he exalts him above all that is called God a man and there's only one God that is the word amen and he said the god of this age has exalted himself above the truth vindicated word above all that's called God so that he has God sits in the temple of God with authority and he is priest for it oh let the people God let the people see the deception he is praised for it and solemnly believed by the people of this evil age now do you see the God and his servants of this evil age amen he says he is making a better world for them to live in by his not by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of god he is making a better world for man to live in and ignoring the promise of God that the only time the world will be will be fit to live in is in the Millennium he said you know my opinion he's made a better world to sin in instead of Libya and that is the truth amen yeah it's a better world to sin in order just disbelieve God just believe the word than it is to believe the word amen why because to believe the word the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth you're gonna live a different life than what's out there in the world you're gonna be totally separated from the world and the things of the world and and brother it will if you're really living it from your soul it'll separate you from the people of the world all there's there's few that would would keep you as friends and so on but other but for the most part no separation because why because you're just your nature it's just too uncomfortable for them your thoughts and your ideas they know they can't convince you of this they can't you persuade you of that no no they know you're that person is religious yeah you're not religious you're spiritual grace brother that were not deceived by the god of this world the god of this evil age hey man oh yeah the prophet of God brings it out eventually concerning the influence of the god of this evil age among in the churches and causing the women to live this way the men to live this way in that way in that way still believe that there are children of God he should know it's the god of this evil age deceived him so we said let's be on our guard sisters brothers be on your guard the Satan is not going to deceive you amen or you're gonna go to manifest this idea that idea now you try to impress God please please God or impress the world are you gonna please please
