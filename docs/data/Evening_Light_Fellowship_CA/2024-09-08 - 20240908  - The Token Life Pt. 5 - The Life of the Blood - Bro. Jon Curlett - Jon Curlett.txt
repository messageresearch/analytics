Sinner and I [Music] know amen praise the Lord praise the Lord the the song just reminds me of a of a testimony I just heard this week from uh Adam called us you know from this church up there they were uh at a wedding in in Canmore uh which is over by B and on the way back there was a couple from brother Jerry's church that uh they had they were driving an old van and Adam said was just it was an old clunker so I guess they were just nursing it along and as they were in an area on the the highway where um where there was no uh Services really close like service stations and stuff they were kind of in a in a bleak area and um he said they they ended up with a fuel leak and uh a few leak on top of an exhaust leak is probably not a good combination and so there was smoke and a bit of fire started to come out of the vehicle so they got out and they had a fire extinguisher and they put out the fire so when they did while all that was happening traffic was just passing by nobody stopped they were all just passing by you know looking at the nice fire I guess and not not bothering but anyway um they were out wondering what to do they said now we got to call a tow truck and uh find a garage and probably have to stay in a hotel overnight and uh while they were figuring out what to do with the cars passing by one car stopped and uh man got out of the carent and came over and asked you know what do you need what can I do to help and he said uh he said well I I'm looking for one part he say not a big part one part would would stop my fuel leak and will get me on the road and uh he said U well my my daughter I said I got my four-year-old daughter in the car and he she said to him while they were driving towards towards the vehicle that was stopped he she said Daddy you got to stop and help those people and uh he that's that's why he stopped he felt he should stop when she said that so when the brother told the man what part he needed he needed he said oh I got that part in a cup in my car he went got it gave it to him and they went and and it just you know find this water in the desert you know this is this is the God we serve he looks after his own you know and it's just time and time again I I see testimonies of it and evidence of that not only in my own life but in the life of many others so uh you know I can only say God be praised you know you know so uh just thought get a blessing of it the brother's not part of our church but he's part of the body that same body and if somebody else is blessed then we're blessed too hey amen 685 Wings of Faith sometimes

the services and if I forget brother Tim please bring my greetings back to Brother Steve clar brother John Andes as well I talked to Brother John on a regular basis not so much brother Steve but uh certainly send them my greetings and and our love to the congregation there amen God bless you 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 18 says for as much as you know that ye are not redeemed with corruptible things if we were redeemed with corruptible things our Redemption would be corruptible that was the problem he says as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers he says you're you're not redeemed from the religious Traditions you're not redeemed from the the the rights and the and the rituals of of religious Works they're not the answer he says you're not done that by natural or corruptible things he says but you are redeemed what with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we're continuing our series on the holy ghost that we call the tolken life and last service we very much preached on the token portion and and we'll get to that in a moment and now we're coming to the life and so we're going to put together the token and we're going to put together the life to come up with the token life amen the the the title of the series and I think most of us that are older that have been well versed in the scriptures and and this end time message we know what I'm talking about but this is to build us up to a foundation because this series on the Holy Ghost is is is why do we need it and then what is it and then what does it do for us amen and so often what we do is we focus on get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost but if you don't why you don't need it you don't know what it's going to do cuz it's got to take us from something and into something amen and so we've got to understand these things so you know the way I preach the way I minister is always to build us from the bottom up amen we want to jump to to third pull we want to jump to seventh seal but guess what you got to go through all the others before you get to those places we have to grow in Christ and so especially for our young people in particular but who knows who needs it this morning that we need to be built from the ground up it's a it's a progressive work it's a progressive revelation we can't just jump to to the end God always works for us through his word and it's all given for our admonition and our correction and our guidance and Leadership and these different things and so last service we spoke about the blood of the natural lamb a perfect lamb but natural nonetheless that was the token that spared the lives of the Israelites and it said and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and we spoke last service how the lamb could be sacrificed the lamb could be uh roasted they could eat it they could dress right they could do everything right but unless the token was applied they were going to die that night the firstborn was going to die of their house the firstborn was going to die of their animals because God was only looking for one thing and that was the token on their home amen so that's we know that the original token nonetheless it it did its job but it did not do the job that it needed to do because they walked out the next morning in Liberty but they were the same people that went in through that door and under that blood the night before it never changed the people when they left Egypt and they were free and they got all the blessings and all the good stuff that that went with them that blood it protected them it saved them it set them free but it did not change their nature it did not change their desires it did not change their thoughts nothing about them was changed that morning except maybe their emotions and so it was not the perfect token amen it didn't take away their temper it didn't take away their lust it didn't take away their family issues it didn't fix their their marriages but it let them go free from what they were under that that for for the 430 years previous amen it did the job that God needed to do it covered their sin but it did not address the root issue amen it was pointing to a time where the token the real token would come and it would fix the issue I mean that's what the token's supposed to do it's supposed to fix the underlying problem it's not supposed to cover it amen so it was pointing to the true thing and so it was only a type and Shadow and like everything from that time was only pointing to the real thing the true thing the the full thing that was going to be coming in the future and we saw that God had prepared a lamb to cover the sins of Adam and Eve in the garden and then Abel sacrificed the lamb and different people did it up to the time of Moses but when the when the the Passover comes when the time of going out comes that's when he says from here on now you got to sacrifice a lamb and every year you've got to come here and You' got to make an atonement for your sins an atonement means a covering he said every year your sins have to be covered otherwise I have to judge you and yet we look around this church and when's the last time we sacrificed the lamb when's the last time we went and we took the blood and put it over the doorpost of our house when's the last time we had bitter herbs and unleavened bread and and a roasted lamb in our house we don't do these things anymore why because the real token has come amen but there had to come a changing of these things and so we need to see why God chose the token as the blood in the first place cuz God didn't randomly pick an element God does all things perfectly he does it with purpose and we read how last service so the blood represented that the life had gone out from something it meant that the price had been paid it meant that there had been a death for a death it was a transformation where one person was supposed to die but the innocent took their death and then they were supposed to take the life of that animal that was innocent amen but God chose the blood he could have chosen the heart why didn't he choose the heart you can't live without a heart you can't live without your lungs you can't live without your brain you can't live without your liver he could have chosen all sorts of things but he chose the blood for a very particular reason and he explains it in Leviticus where he says whatsoever man there be of the House of Israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul so that word atonement we said means a covering so it hid the issue it covered the issue but it did not fix the problem he says the the the the life of that blood is what's covering your life the life for the life the blood covers up the sins and so it's not just necessary for life it's it's not that just that blood's necessary for life it's that it carries life itself with in it and we see within the body that the blood is the life of the body we have all sorts of things we have a a system we have organs we have all these things working together but it's the blood that carries the oxygen and the nutrients to what is needed and then it's also what carries away much of what is not it brings in the oxygen takes out the carbon dioxide to the lungs and these different things it's the transportation method for life within a body and nothing else in the body has that capability the brain controls the body the heart pumps the blood the lungs add and remove oxygen and and carbon dioxide and these things our lungs make it happen but the blood is the key to it all take the blood out and the body doesn't work it's dead why the life is in the blood you can be brain dead and still be alive but without the blood everything just goes apart amen so we see here why it's the blood and he says therefore I said unto the children of Israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood now it's an odd thing to say because if there's Life In The Blood you naturally think well maybe I ought to eat blood maybe ought to drink blood and we see in the old times that they thought that they thought that if they would drink the blood of an animal they kill an animal that was ferocious or fast or very strong and they would take it not the Israelites of course but the pagans would do it those that didn't know God and they would take that blood and they would drink it because what they believe was that the attributes of what they had killed would come into them if they drank its blood and God says you can't be like the pagans because it doesn't work in fact if you drink blood at at best it'll make you uncomfortable at worst it can kill you so you're not supposed to do it but they they believe that if you could take it into you if you could drink the blood of what it was that you killed then you could get what that animal or what that person even had some of them would even drink human blood because if they killed a great warrior they wanted his strength they wanted his ferocity they wanted his speed whatever it might be and so they drank it God says you can't be that way because it won't work it can't work the life is in the blood but it doesn't transfer to you the way that way and so God says don't do it if you do it I'll cut you off I'll cut you off from them but here's the thing the greater truth is that what they thought it would do was exactly what God was going to do because he says you can't take the blood because nothing good will come out of it but there's coming a day where you'll take my blood and it'll do exactly what you're thinking that this Blood you're taking today will do for you it was pointing to the real thing and he says you can't have the real thing until the real thing comes amen so the intention of the blood sacrifice was to do exactly what they thought the blood was supposed to do which was transfer the life put the nature back in the person that was under that sacrifice but that's not what it was going to do the pagans believed it but it would never work that way but see God didn't want to just cover sin God wanted to eradicate it God wanted to erase it God didn't just want to take it away God wanted to take care of the very root of that problem because the blood was just covering the sin but it was a debt that was building and building and building and so the mound was getting bigger and bigger if you've ever been stuck in credit cards you ever look at your balance and they're you're paying 19.99% and every month you look and even if you don't do anything wrong the debt is building because there's interest building up on it and it's the same with Humanity they were building and building and building and all it was happening was the blood was covering and the blood was covering but the mound was get getting bigger and bigger and bigger until there was no way that we could ever pay there was no way we could pay it in the first place but there was definitely no way we could pay it after that so the purpose of that lamb that was sacrificed was to take my sins my mistakes my fault on himself and it would become sinful in my place that perfect lamb that sinless spotless lamb would become imperfect and its Perfection was supposed to come to me and yet time and time again they go through the Passover they'd sacrifice the lamb and then they would come out and they would be exactly the same person that they went in why it was only a symbol it was only a type it was only a shadow of what was supposed to happen why because animal life and human life are incompatible I can't take Lamb's blood and put it in me a lamb does not live the way that I live a lamb is perfect and innocent because it doesn't know evil it has no soul it has no understanding of right and wrong it is perfect because it has no understanding of sin it doesn't make any choices in the first place it doesn't have a conscience it can only react in the moment based on its instincts and it's never wrong a lamb is never wrong because it doesn't have to make a choice amen so therefore its life can't come into me because it's living in a completely different sphere of reality it has no soul it has no choice it has no understanding so God says don't drink the blood don't touch the blood don't ever take it into you because there's going to come a time where the perfect work will come God was requiring a perfect blood from a lamb that was compatible with my life and your life to do a finished work amen now I know this is basic this morning and I'm sure that we understand this but again we're building to what the Holy Ghost does to what it means to be a born again believer and we have to understand why we need it so we can understand what it's going to do when we get it because otherwise what happens is we come into church and we have a religious experience and we think I've got the Holy Ghost no no no no no you just have your conscience eased many times but your desires are still the same your nature is still the same your life is still the same so you can't have been under the blood of Jesus Christ because that's not the way it works that's the way the blood of the natural lamb works but the perfect lamb does a different thing cuz blood alone won't do the work blood alone won't do the work the blood covers but it does not change right what you you you have to get what's in the blood to change you to take care of the root problem that's why we're talking about the life of the blood this morning you know to a to a Believer the effect of the payment of sin and the covering of sin is no different you don't know any difference whether it's paid or whether it's covered the fact is you're still you so whether it's paid or whether it's just covered up you still walk along the same person you always were and so all it does is it keeps the Judgment of God off you but it's not doing anything for you personally except holding back his wrath in our life amen we're not looking to just sit here and be the same people I hope this morning amen I want to overcoming power amen I want something that changes my nature I want something that changes my my life something that changes the way I think something that changes the way I react something that changes my marriage something that changes how I spend my time every day I want something that takes me from what I was into what I'm supposed to be amen he continues here and he says and I won't read the whole thing for the sake of time this morning but at the end he says for the life of All Flesh is in the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off that word cut off there the imagery the word there literally means the cutting off of a limb in other words you'll be separated from the body you'll be taken away from the body of Believers and in those days if they did it they would take them outside the camp and they would kill them and they had no part in the people and they had no part of God and they were eternally separated from God because they drank the blood that they weren't supposed to that's severe God didn't mess around in those days it was the law it was not Grace and so when you transgress then you paid a harsh price but now we come forward to the book of Hebrews and Paul is talking in the Old Testament about everything that happened under the law and everything that happened under the blood of lambs and bulls and goats and these things and he says now when these things were thus ordained in other words when God brought these into into our lives he says the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood so always with blood the high priest came in once a year with blood which he offered for himself so remember he went in first with blood of the lamb and it was there and it was put upon The Mercy Seat the the the shakina glory the holy of holies was there God was in there and that man walked in with blood in front of him and if he did not die it meant that God had covered his accepted the blood of the lamb in his hands or or the the bulls and goats whatever it was and and he accepted that man and then that man went out and he got more blood and he came in and he said now this is for the people and then God would accept that their their sins would be covered for the entire year amen but to walk in without blood was to die if that man walked in it didn't matter how clean he was how well he washed behind his ears that morning how right his clothes were how much of a priest he was how much of a right he had to be there he had to go in with blood he always had to go in with blood it says but into the second went the high priest okay we cover that the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing so in other words they couldn't really come into the presence of God the way that he intended or desired it was only a shadow it was only pointing to something that wasn't yet in existence and in the Amplified it says by this the Holy Spirit points out that the way into the true holy of holies is not yet thrown open as long as the former or the outer portion of the Tabernacle remains a recognized institution Still Standing so he says as long as there's sacrifice as as long as there's a priesthood as long as there's a high priest as long as there's a holy of holies that's veiled God has not moved on to the second stage of what he really wants us to do as long as that's still standing God ain't going to move into anything else there has to be a Breaking of it there has to be a destroying of it there has to be a tearing of it so as long as the rights and rituals of animal sacrificed and Temple worship were there the intended means of getting into the presence of God was not there the perfect way of getting into the presence of God was not there it was only there a little bit amen everyone had to be under the blood to possibly get into his presence and then out of all the posses one man per year got to go into his presence and that was it so you're you're a part of the family of God and only one person gets to go into the literal presence of God once a year God didn't want that we see in the Garden of Eden he came down the cool of e of the evening and he walked with Adam and Eve day by day God was looking for constant relationship and yet under the blood of of of natural perfect animals only one person could come in once per year and that was it God's trying to redeem us back to something more than once a year let me say it this way church if we're only seeing him once a year if we're only seeing him once a week if we're only seeing him twice a week when we go to church there's a problem with our Redemption because he's Made A Way Beyond that amen Way Beyond that it says which was a figure for the time then present in which they were offered both gifts and sacrific says but watch this he says that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience so in other words even the priests as holy and as consecrated and as Sanctified as they were when they came into this the blood that they brought in the sacrifices they made could not make them perfect it couldn't ease their conscience they knew what they did they knew what they were they knew the way they thought and they went in and they knew when they went out they were no different than they went in and that word perfect we hear that word perfect and we always think spotless but it doesn't that word perfect means finishing a course or race to reach the end in other words going into the presence of God once a year with the blood of a natural animal could never finish the work that God intended in their life we think getting into his presence we got to get into his presence more than once a day more than once a week Church we've got to get into his presence regularly he's the Tree of Life Christ is the tree of life amen we've got to be feasting on him every single day so in other words all the forms all the rituals all the signing your name on a book all the church attendance could never make us perfect amen it said and it which stood only or it consisted only of meats and drinks and diverse different Washings and carnal fleshly or human ordinances imposed on them until the time of restor of reformations so in other words it was dos and don'ts and you had no other choice but to do it otherwise you died it was legal it was the law it was a must it wasn't optional but you see there it says until the time of reformation and that word Reformation there in the original it means to restore to its natural and normal condition something which in some way protrudes or has got got out of line comparable to a broken limb that needs to be set in place so in other words the laws and the rituals and the religion and the church attendance was just a Band-Aid on a broken arm the arm was still broken but it wasn't causing them to die it was keeping death at Bay but it was not fixing the broken arm and yet it's amazing that under these sacrifice Christ comes and they all think they're perfect the churchgoers think they're perfect the ministry thinks they're perfect the Mi the the priesthood thinks they're perfect they studied all the books of Moses and they were so assured in what they were doing that they were tithing even their mint and cumin they take a piece of mint I don't even know what a piece of mint looks like this big and they cut off a tenth of it and they bring it into the temple that's how exacting they were and then when Christ comes he's the word made flesh he's the perfect lamb come for them and they sing they don't need him to fix them they need him to affirm them that's the response they had tell me I'm doing good tell me I'm doing good and he says no you're not that's not going to get you there he said not only that but you neglect the weightier matters of the law you got no mercy you got no Grace you have no no feeling for the needs of the people it's just you you you you you so many times we can come into church expecting a pat on the back this is a house of correction correct doesn't mean to spank you or beat you it means to show you the way of truth and you choose or you turn it down and it's up to you that's what correction means and then if you're a child of God he'll get into discipline later which is he'll give you a he'll give you a supernatural spanking if we have need of these things amen but Paul was pointing back to these things and he says they were only there to hold you they were just holding back the wrath of God they were holding back the Judgment of God they were giving you something to do until he would do what you could never do amen what he was trying to fix the problems and so all the acts of the Jewish faith were just Band-Aids they're holding people until Christ could come and do what really needed to be done now listen to this quote it says and the life laying in this blood cell The Sinner being guilty of sin the most innocent that he could offer would be the life of this lamb now the reason that it typed the coming of the real Lamb of God and could not take away sin It could only cover sin because the life that was in the blood after it was broken could not return upon the worshipper he says because the worshipper was a human with a soul and the life that went from the animal was merely the life of a beast and the life of a beast could not coincide with the life of a man so therefore the worshipper went out with the same conscience the same desire to sin as he did coming in can you imagine the frustration there were days I I believe when Saul dedicated the temple I think they did something like 20,000 animals over that dedication and yet after that was all said and done every single worshipper walked out the same way they came in all that life all that blood all that sacrifice all that innocence and it did nothing except cover the Judgment cover the sins to keep the Judgment of God away from them but now I want us to to move forward this morning because we know that Jesus comes along and he's the perfect Lamb of God and we'll show that shortly but I want you to see what Jesus tells the people to do because we he's been we we've been told already in Leviticus you definitely don't drink the blood but I want you to see what happens now when Jesus comes and this is near the end of Jesus ministry okay and what he's doing is he's bringing them into what he really wanted for them what he really came to do because before this it's signs and wonders and healings and all these things but now he's coming to fixing them he'd heal them one day and guess what the next week they'd get sick he'd deliver them one day and they could go out the next week and get another demon in them why because they weren't living under a fix it was just a covering and Jesus is talking with them and he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me has everlasting life and the nominal Christian world will say see that's how you get salvation believe on Christ but watch how he continues he saysi am that bread of life and they've been talking about the Mana in the wilderness and he's talking about the Mana which is the Heavenly bread but even the Heavenly bread wasn't enough Church they ate Angels food for 40 years in the desert and only two of them made it into the Canaan land the Passover required unleavened bread and Jesus is saying I'm that unleavened bread I'm that pure word he says your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead what's Jesus trying to do he's saying your religious experience is not eternal life your dos and your don'ts are not eternal life your family heritage and their Christianity is not eternal life he's trying to get them out of their comfort zone so they can come to a place where they can receive what they really need he's trying to break the feathers of their own religious nature he says this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die he says I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world so Jesus is describing himself as the bread of life and he's saying you have to eat me to receive life and he's drawing parallels to the Mana that came down from heaven in the desert he's drawing parallels to the Passover me as well but watch what happens when he says this because it's all been good till now it says and the Jews there therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them see what he said was already hard enough he says verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you so he's already said you got to eat my flesh now he says drink my blood can you imagine their faces when he said this one they're not allowed to drink blood of an animal now he's saying drink the blood out of a human they they look at this as a pagan ritual and he's saying unless you do this what you have no life the life is in the blood and he says unless you drink my blood you don't have any life he's saying the law is about to be fulfilled and when that's done there's going to come something greater than the law and it's going to come through me and you better be ready for it what's he talking about he's talking about the life of the blood he's not just talking about his blood but he's talking about the life of the blood it couldn't come from a natural lamb but now he's the perfect Lamb of God and he's saying this is the only blood you can ever drink because it's the only one compatible with who and what you are this is the only blood that'll make a difference this is the only life that'll make a difference You' got to part partake of me because I am the life that you need what kind of Life verse 54 says who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed that word indeed means it's real it's the real deal it's the true thing it's real food it's real drink it'll do real work it'll do what nothing else would do before it's a complete working food if you'll take every part of me and then he doubles down again I guarantee this was a shocking sermon he says he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him what's he saying this is a restoration of relationship you could only come in once a year one person a year you do this and anybody can come to God he's opening way he says as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead but he that eateth of this bread shall live forever and then he never explained it see normally when Jesus said something like this he'd at least go to his disciples on the side and he'd say here's what I meant but here he doesn't explain any of it he just leaves it out there he just floats it out there he didn't say you know this is a tough one just trust me I I'll tell you later don't don't say anything don't walk away I'll tell you guys later what this means he doesn't do anything he just puts it out there and then he shuts up and at the same time he says this is the only way to eternal life so he makes it another absolute he makes it another requirement it used to be the law of blood of the blood of lambs and bulls and goats now he says no you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood otherwise you have no eternal life you have no access to eternal life except this and he doesn't explain it they were banking on their religious Works they were banking on their family heritage they were banking on being a priest but here's the thing did Jesus ever make them eat his flesh and drink his blood no of course not he was hiding his purpose yet speaking the truth in symbol form but he never explained it much of the script scripture is in symbol form and people want to interpret literally every single time and it leads them down past that are nowhere good why because they don't stick around long enough to get the revelation of what God's really talking about now I know there are people listening to me this morning that aren't in this service that aren't attending and I want to even speak to them this morning don't throw out what you hear just because you haven't heard it before amen don't throw out what you hear because the mainstream preachers and churches aren't preaching it you know what mainstream is mainstream is kabad the glory of the Lord has departed because mainstream is no longer gospel it was never gospel the gospel Jesus said narrow is the way and few there be that find it mainstream is never the way to Calvary mainstream is never the way to eternal life mainstream is not the way to a resurrection and a Rapture amen God is not in it he'll never be in it why because mainstream lets you be comfortable with where you're at it does not require you to go all the way with God it does not require you to go all way with the word of God listen there are people that have left things and then they'll come in and they'll listen and they'll go away because it doesn't match what they heard but yet they left what they heard before because it wasn't satisfying them then to come to something different and say well it doesn't match what I've heard therefore it can't be right no stay there a while if you don't understand something lay it on the shelf and just say Lord I'm not sure I like what I'm seeing but I don't understand the words and just lay it there listen I don't everything that I understand today I did not understand stand 5 and 10 years ago I grow in Revelation I grow in in my understanding of the word and the ways of God and so we've got to be able to put something on the shelf and just say Lord I'm going to leave it with you and let you show it to me by your word through your holy spirit amen the the the pure word is never popular it is never common it is rarely found and it's very few people that go all the way with it amen and it's a people that want to be right with God rather than just be right amen what was Jesus meaning when he said you must drink my blood why do you drink blood to get the life from it that's what they always thought he didn't mean drink my blood but he said you got to get the life of my blood that's what he was talking about there's a life that's coming out of that blood and when that happens when I sacrifice my life for your sins that blood will actually do what the blood of bulls and goats and Lambs never could and it can come into you and it can change you from the inside out it'll change you back into what you were supposed to be in the original condition amen but he never explained it he just said it and then he let it sit there what was he doing church he was testing their revelation of who he was that's it they'd seen the Loaves and Fishes get multiplied they'd seen the sick healed they'd seen the demons cast out they'd seen him walk on water they'd seen him do all sorts of Mighty Miracles and then he says something they don't understand and he's saying do you really believe who I am time and time again Jesus before would say something mysterious and explain it but now he's coming to the opening of the word he's coming to the gospel and he's saying will you turn this corner will you turn this corner and catch what happens we're skipping a couple verses because they're they're all talking amongst themselves how's he going to do this what is this it says when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured of it he said unto them does this offend you Church notice now he's not addressing the priesthood now he's talking to people right in his church his disciples his congregation CU remember there's the 70 and then there's the 12 he had 82 so now what does he do Church does he say now guys no what does he do he elevates it again he says what and if you shall see the son of man descend up where he was before now he's talking about his Ascension his resurrection and his Ascension he's the son of Mary and Joseph they might think and now he's talking as if he's some angel or some God going up and down he says if you think that's a tough one well what about if you see me going up and down into heaven and then he says these words it is the spirit that quickeneth it's the spirit that makes us live he says the flesh profits nothing in other words the flesh can't do a single thing right in God's eyes or compared to God's ways of doing things he says the words that I speak unto you they are SP spirit and they are life why they were resting on the books of Moses and he says search the scriptures you think you've got salvation in them he says it's right here your salvation is now in flesh the words have come off the page they come into a flesh body and that's standing in front of you search them and see if they don't tell you exactly who I am and they did and they did and it says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him the 70 turned around remember Church the 70 he had given them power over demons over sickness power to heal or to raise the dead that's the ministry of the 70 that walked away signs and wonders is not proof of him in your life it's proof of his benefits it's not proof of him and we'll see even of the 12 there's one that's still left but remember they rejected what did they reject not the power not the authority they rejected the word amen they rejected the word in flesh which meant that they rejected the word in spirit when it would come later and in truth and they fulfill what Paul would talk about in Hebrews 6 where he said they tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come but never went all the way and so they cannot come back somebody has to fulfill it and it's people that will go 90% of the way and then pull back why because they didn't stick around long enough for God to reveal it to them he says then said Jesus son to the 12 will ye also go away and then Simon Peter Simon Peter answered him and said Lord no we understand everything you said we're good we're going to stay with you no Peter didn't have a clue what he was talking about not the not the not the foggiest idea as we would say here Peter had no idea what he was talking about and yet he said Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life he believed it without understanding he says and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Church there is nothing can replace personal revelation in your life I can stand up here and I can preach till I'm bleue in the face and and and and give you the foundation of the truth of the word of the doctrines I can move mountains I could heal the sick raise the dead it would not matter if you don't have a personal revelation that you have met Christ and he's living in your life by the Holy Spirit that's the only thing that will because we're going to come up against things where we don't understand we don't understand why it's taking so long do we brother Grant we don't we don't understand why it's taking so long we don't understand why we go through things we do we don't understand why some people aren't in we don't understand why some people aren't out we don't understand how God works we don't understand why he's silent at times but there's got to be an anchor inside of us that says yet I believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and you're living in me today that's the only thing that's going to hold us not emotion not some power it's got to be the life within us a revelation of Jesus Christ personally that 70 walked away that day they cast out demons theyd healed the sick they raised the Dead the scripture testifies of it and yet they walked away from the Living Word in flesh because they did not understand and they never got to a place where they would ever be changed he says and he's doing it the same thing today speaking of Christ when he sends forth a meeting like that revivals and starts a meeting in the earth and starts moving with along with these great signs and wonders and then you see come back that same old school of teaching there's something wrong there somewhere he says there's something new coming forth when Jesus came out after he's a fine Rabbi he could go to any pulpit and preach when he was Healing The Sick when oh they like to have him over there see when he's doing the works they love him everyone wants the Loaves and fish everyone wants their to be healed their loved ones to be healed but then he says now what happens when he brings the word he says but one day he sat down and said I and my father are one brother he wasn't so popular after that when he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you but he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day then he wasn't so popular from them they said this man's a vampire this man is a beel that's the way he done them things he could tell for forun he looked through their minds and perceived their thoughts he's a fortune teller the word made flesh and they're calling him satanic he says but what it was he was the word of God made manifest for that hour and he was Duty bound he said I do always that which is pleasing to my father he says God help us to do the same thing do that which is pleasing the father Church what causes people to Fall Away not the anointing not not the power not the demonstration not the gifts it's always the word it's always the truth and the closer it comes to who and what we are the more people back away from it why because Christ is the word the rest is just the benefits we go to a job and we get all the benefits the the signs and wonders the tongues the healings the Deliverance that's all just the benefits package but it's Christ the word that we have to receive and that's the most important thing in this we see now how after after this that Christ comes to Jerusalem and he went to the temple three days before the Passover you remember and he goes in and the first day he goes in and this and the the Sadducees are there or the Pharisees are there and they question him and he answers them perfectly then he comes back the next day and they ask him again and by the third day there's only a lawyer left that's willing to ask him a question because they can find no fault in him and he answers him perfectly and then he is what he goes through the the the Passover and these different things and then he comes up before Herod and before Pilate and they can find no fault in him and so he's claimed he he he's verified as the perfect lamb but we know that on the evening of that third day in Jerusalem he goes into the Passover room with his disciples and now he finally starts to explain what he was talking about about eating his flesh and drinking his blood and he clarifies hey I wasn't telling you you guys are going to literally eat or drink my body he starts to show them what he's talking about and he's still talking in types but he's opening up the word to them and it says and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and says take eat this is my body and you can imagine the big sigh of relief that they said well I guess we're not going to have to eat his body Jesus is explaining the Passover feast and he's saying what you've been doing for 2400 years is now being fulfilled what it was pointing to the pipes and Shadows of the Passover are now being fulfilled in me and in my life and in my body and it's all he says it's all pointing to me the feast is just pointing to me it was always bringing us to this day and now you're going to get the Fulfillment of what that meant what is his body church it's the bread of life it's the word of God it's the unadulterated word it's the unleavened bread it's pure amen as we studied last service you can't mix anything with it John 1:1 says this and in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word was was God that's a perfect explanation of the godhead right there but it says in verse 16 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so Jesus comes down now and it's the word made flesh it's the living bread and he says you got to feed on the word of God and the word of God is not just the Books of Moses it's not just letters and words on a page but it's a person it's a living thing it has power it has Grace it has truth it has Authority amen remember what Paul said later he would say the letter kth but the spirit giveth life and we see Christ comes and he's the Living Word with the spirit of God inside of him and those men those priests are standing there with the letter of the word and what did it do it killed them because they clung to their Works rather than to the changing work of Calvary what happens why does the word why does the letter kill that way because it tells you what you ought to be what you ought to do and you believe it and yet you can't live it cuz it takes the spirit to live it amen knowing the truth doesn't make you right you've got to be the truth to be right amen it takes the Life of Christ the Holy Spirit to make that happen so he said okay you got to eat my my body and it's this bread then he says he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to him saying drink ye all of it all of it he says for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many of the remissions of sins so they know okay we don't have to drink his blood now now we just have to drink the communion wine now wine we know always represents one thing stimulation of Revelation and the greatest Revelation you can have is that you're a son or a daughter of God and your sins are not only forgiven they are erased under the blood of Christ that's the first great revelation we have you ask me why I'm happy well I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone that's the first revelation we all get but it's not the only Revelation that's only the start of our walk it's not the end of our walk amen child of God born of God going back to God and we grow in Grace and Faith before him but what makes the word live Church a personal revelation amen a personal revelation that it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the stimulating agent for the word without the Holy Spirit we're just message Idols that's the only way I can say it we're just message Idols we're a for but we're not the it we're not the living word amen the holy spirit's the quickening power the it literally means the living power and it makes us live it by Revelation in our lives amen Paul had the letter of the word and he was Antichrist for 30 or 40 years persecuting the true church but as soon as he got the spirit the quickening power he turned 180 degrees in his life why cuz now the word had come alive and it was a personal revelation to him he thought he had Revelation but what he had was a satanic interpretation that was killing him Jesus is saying drink my blood and typ and he's saying you need the life of the word in order to make this work can't just take the letter you got to have the life with it who is the word Christ what do we need the same life that Christ had he was the Living Word we're supposed to become the Living Word Church consider this animal life is compatible with animal life a lamb can transfuse to another lamb human life is compatible to human life a human can transfuse to another human catch this God's life is only compatible with God's life amen the life of the word made flesh is only compatible with the word made flesh when Christ came if he was just a man then all we got was human life but if he was God in flesh then we got the life of God in flesh and the life of God in flesh is compatible with only one thing God inesh flesh amen when you get the Holy Ghost Church it is the seal it is the key it is the authority it is everything you have need of to take you from this world into the next amen saying that will choke a lot of people today but the life of the word made flesh is only compatible with the word made flesh today came to do the exact same thing to produce the same thing what's God doing when he gives you the Holy Ghost he's confirming who you are we look in John 1 a little further down says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name now that sounds like people accept or reject Christ and then based on that decision then God gives them power which is the Holy Spirit to become sons of God but that is 100% wrong absolutely wrong we have to let scripture interpret scripture amen so then we come to Paul in Galatians 4:6 he says because ye are Sons because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father see we look at John 1:12 it says to them gave he power what he didn't give them power to receive it he gave them power to receive the word and the word leads them to the Holy Spirit you can't receive God unless you are a child of God in the first place it's the only thing compatible with God is his own flesh and blood amen it's his own nature his own DNA and so then he says because ye are Sons because ye are Sons not because you chose not because you made a decision not because you think you made a move towards God but rather because you already are a child of God regardless of what your condition is this morning because you are a child of God he sends his holy spirit your way and it Woos you and it pulls you and it convicts you and it brings you into his presence until you start to say I am a child of God Lord I'm coming back to you make me more like you taking communion does not give you eternal life but but if you look at what Jesus said there you could say communion gives you eternal life the Catholics make a big deal of it they turn it into a magical event where the priest literally changes the bread into the body of Christ and the wine into the blood of Christ and I'm reading from their website okay says in the celebration of the Eucharist that's what they call the communion so in the celebration of the communion bread and wine become the body and blood of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit and the instrumentality of the priests as soon as we touch it Church it ain't God it either is God or it isn't God but it doesn't take me to turn it into God but if this is true then the communion will be all we need to do because you'll be eating his flesh and drinking his blood and Jesus said that's all you need to do you do that you have eternal life but you go have communion communion is a part of our Christian Walk we're going to have it in October we don't have to have communion every day Paul said as often often as you do it he didn't say do it every day didn't say do it every service but as often as you do it do it in remembrance of me it's supposed to be pointing to a work you've already accepted in your life something he's already done inside of you amen Judas drank the wine and ate the bread right there with Jesus if there was a Holy Communion that was the Holy Communion with Christ himself there and yet what did he do he walked out and he betrayed him and he was revealed as the son of predition communion doesn't save you brother Bram said communion is a Battleground amen as to where your life is amen but rather communion is a remembrance a symbol of what has happened in their lives because they still had to come to the day of Pentecost and when Peter came down those stairs from the upper room he didn't come down and say everybody take communion did he he said repent be baptized for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit that's the way to get eternal life amen now we know the crucifixion story we know the death of Christ and that death reflected what we were worthy of it was not a nice death it was not an easy death it wasn't you know a you're just getting your head chopped off it wasn't anything like that it was a long dragged out painful death to sit there and think about everything you'd done wrong we've talked about this many times about how he who knew no sin became our sin he never had a sinful thought he never had a sinful desire he never had committed sin and the weight of the entire world's sin came on him in a moment and he had a body built to support it until he would give up his life but he's sitting there and all the smut and the filth and everything that we have ever done Church from the smallest to the biggest coursing through his mind he literally became our sin cuz remember when Christ comes it's not just a symbol now it's literal it's literal life and it's literal sin he embodied our sin our sin literally became became him his whole makeup was sin and he dies up there but I want to look at the very end because we're talking about the life of the blood and we see at the end that Jesus does not lose his life he gives up his life everything he did was voluntary CU remember the Lamb of the Old Testament could not choose to give its life it couldn't choose and if it knew what it was choosing then it wouldn't do it but Christ came and he said not my will but thine be done and he voluntarily gave himself to the beatings to the whippings to the the the the slapping and the spitting and the making fun of and the nakedness and then the receiving of all of our sin on him took it all voluntarily and then he comes up and he goes to Calvary and he gives his own life and he was perfect he was perfect in life we said he he went through all of the judgments he went through all of the the the checks by the priesthood and the government and everyone and he was the perfect lamb and then he comes up to Calvary and he gives a perfect life and that's where we started the service it said for as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot you know we tend to look at redeemed sometimes too much on the what we get side but what he's trying to do on the Redemption rtion is get us back to what we are that's the first work of redemption is to restore us back to Eden is to restore our natur to destroy our or to to restore our character to restore the way we think to restore the way we react to bring us back into Sons and Daughters of God and then from there add in all the blessings and the benefits of our inheritance amen it means we're restored back not just we get our stuff back but we get ourselves back first and foremost that's the work of the life of the blood amen but there needed to be blood that was shed on Calvary because remember when they went and they sacrificed the lamb what they do is they would slit the throat and then the way of doing it they had very sharp knives and they have a way of slaying the throat so that there's no pain but all that happens is that lamb knows it's dying and all the blood pours out and they need that blood for the sacrifice and to go on to The Sinner and these different things and so Jesus is on that cross and his blood is dripping out but it's not being poured out and so we see what happens and it seems unnecessary when we look at the at the seene that was there but yet it had to happen because the word of God had to be fulfilled and the law had to be fulfilled perfectly and it says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost he gave up his life he released it voluntarily was not taken from him remember what brother BR would say he took that Stinger of death and he pulled it in he gave his life willingly but then when they're coming around they come to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they didn't break his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forth with came there out blood and water because remember when the lamb was slain the blood had to pour out and what did he do there church blood and water and he's already given his Spirit he poured out the three elements that were necessary for us to be changed back into into our original condition blood for forgiveness of sins water for baptism and the washing of Water by the word and then H the Holy Spirit which is the life of God inside of you you have to be all three you have to have all three to be born again you can have the the the blood be justified you're not born again Sanctified by the washing of Water by the word you're not born again it takes the life because you have to be born life has to come forth you got to die and then come out a new creation amen and as soon as Christ dies what happens there's an earthquake and then the veil is torn from top to bottom on the holy of holies remember Paul was saying that they would come in and every year they come in that one time one person had access to God and as soon as Christ dies what happens the veil is torn completely what's he saying there's a way made access is wide open there is no reason there's no excuse today to say why you can't come into the presence of God but what was he also showing church he was showing God ain't in there anymore Christ died that veil was torn the shikina glory the personal presence of God left and you know what happened in there everything started to Die the Mana started to rot see the Mana it was original Mana from Moses time and it in the presence of God it never went bad they had Aaron's Rod there that blossomed and produced almonds that was always there they could always taste and see that God was alive and well and the next day when the priesthood went into that room it was rotten they knew that the glory of the Lord had departed and you know what they did Church they sewed up that torn curtain and they went on pretending that God was with them what was it God was saying I'm not dwelling in a holy of holies anymore I'm changing my Tabernacles I'm changing my dwelling place and it's not where only one person can get to me and you have to be a minister and you have to be this and you have to be that he was saying no I'm coming down into a new set of Tabernacles now not just one but I'm going to be in all of them Hebrews 10 says this and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins talk about a fruitless Endeavor holding back but could never take it away but this man speaking of Christ after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot still foot stol for by one offering what was that offering Church blood water and spirit amen one offering he had perfected remember it could not perfect nor could it erase the conscience he says by one offering he has perfected forever he has completed he has finished forever them that are Sanctified past tense as soon as that was done we stepped into a perfect work we stepped into a finished work we stepped into a complete work in God's eyes that's what the token was pointing to was a blood that would do this that would Perfect The Sinner forever that would finish the work that the blood of bulls and goats and Lambs could never do ab brah says this perfected for how long forever then what is the Holy Ghost friend we've allowed it to too many things you Lutheran oh my you think because you live the Lu you join the Lutheran Church the just shall live by faith Luther says we got it but they found out they didn't you methodists when you got Sanctified and shouted and clapped your hands and run up and down the aisle you thought you had it but come to find out you didn't the Pentecostals when they could speak in tongues or dance in the spirit they thought they had it but they found out they didn't Judas went to all of those levels not speaking in tongues perhaps but all the signs and wonders he says all those things are all right but that isn't it it's the person the Holy Spirit himself the resurrected Christ and when you lay your hands by faith upon God's accepted and provided sacrifice which was absolutely perfect there's the body of Christ and out of Adam's side came a rib that made his bride and out of the side of Christ came the blood the water spirit for his bride Hallelujah he says and how do we get into that body by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body Romans 81 there is therefore now see remember under the blood of bulls and goats it could never fix their conscience now watch what he says Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit they're like Abraham they call those things which were not as though they were because they are dead to the things of the world and alive again in Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you want to know how you got the if you got the holy ghost look right there they are dead to the things of the world and they are alive again in Christ we'll talk about that in the coming days one last quote before we close he says but the worshipper when the worshipper once purged once purged Church by the blood of Christ has no more conscience of sin because the life that came out of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is none other than his own life that returns to the believer and brings the believer into fellowship with himself amen let's stand musicians would come amen I can testify to that it used to be when I did something it would hang over me and it would bother me forever and forever and ever I still make mistakes I don't know if you guys are still making mistakes I'm still making mistakes and you know what when I make mistakes I don't like it I don't feel good about it but I'll tell you I can take it to him and say Lord I'm sorry I didn't mean to do it I didn't plan to do it but I did it and I say Lord will you forgive me and what do I do I claim The Blood Brother Bob took my song at the end of service there I claim the blood and you know what church I can walk out without a thought in the world of what has happened that's the freedom there's no condemnation there's conviction but conviction brings me to repentance which brings me to put it under the blood of Christ and then I can walk away and my conscience is completely clean not seared see some people there's a sear they can do anything and walk away that's not what we're talking about but our conscience is clean we have no more conscience of sin we're not thinking about it we're not beating ourselves up about it we're not Catholics telling God that he's got to do something bad to make us pay for it amen we can put it under the blood of Jesus Christ and walk away and say I'm free I'm completely free I never did it in the first place amen that's what his work will do what do we need church we don't just need the blood we need the life of the blood amen the blood covers the the the the blood pays the dead off amen it doesn't just separate us from our sins Church it says they are not even there brother remember what he said it says it's like a drop of ink and a bucket of bleach you put it in there it doesn't exist anymore it completely dissolves it your sins are gone amen that's what happens under the blood of Christ it takes away the condemnation it sets us free from our past see we tend to look 10 years back what about yesterday what about this week it can set us free from all of those things amen if we can only confess it to him but that blood of Christ with it it released the life of the blood for the first time in history we could receive the life of the blood back on us to live a new way to talk a new way to have a marriage in a new way to Worship in a new way to understand the word in a new way yo Jesus first sermon he said the anointing is upon me I'm anointed he said to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised we tend to look at those as things that are come against us but I'll tell you the greatest Deliverance I need is from myself remember brother Aaron talked about that he says we got two great enemies Satan and ourselves and the first thing he comes us do is to set us free from ourselves amen we die out and then he deals with what Satan's trying to do in our lives and it takes the life of the blood to do it the Holy Spirit which is the Life of Christ amen amen God bless you I trust it's been a blessing I trust that you'll be blessed in the services coming up I wish I could be here I hate to miss when ministers are coming in but it's a necessary uh situation I guess so God bless you each one amen pray for us as we travel
