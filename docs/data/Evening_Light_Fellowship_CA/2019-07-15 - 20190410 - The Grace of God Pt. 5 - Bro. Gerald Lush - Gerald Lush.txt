are the thoughts to a conclusion regarding grace you can never you can never never really finish it amen because it's all grace amen every every second of the day that we are here it is the grace of God amen so pray the grace of God to continue with the saints of their need and the prayer requests that went over the pulpit today or whatever's on your heart and also I don't know if it was mentioned or not but I assume that brother Bob got it was a prayer request from India and it was from a to me it's a brother Samuel and I would not be able to say brother vice world would but I would not be able to say is is his actual name that comes upon the email but he always signs it with brother Samuel a man but he s sent a quite a number of email to me and it's and it's usually contains scriptures and quotes for the Prophet and and I've got to say it's good a man he God has blessed that brother with a revelation of the message now where he is in India I do not know hey maybe brother Basha would know once he saw the name but he did send an email he was today or yesterday concerning a prayer request also like brother Leo it was for his mother a man and she also is an elderly woman but he sprained the grace of God to his mother so he asked us to remember her in prayer so tonight not only while you're sitting in the in the pews here but when you go home to remember brother Lee and his need but also to remember this brother Samuel in India and and he's made also for his mother and their mothers of course our elderly and our brother Leo said his mother's in her 90s and for sister Dunford that with sister Betty's mother and she was 95 almost 96 when the Lord called her home but she was compared to compared to others in in their 40s or 50s she was young that is that's the truth that's the absolute truth she was she she did not manifest old age I don't think she believed in it her faith her faith was youth a man she had the faith of a young person that's the truth she said she was oh she lost she loved just to just to get him to the service get into the church and the sing in the praise the Lord Amen that was sister Dunford a man and so I trust that we maintain that that youthfulness if the Lord tarries and if he doesn't try we're gonna get it just think sister daughter went went from here to there you where she went she's a young woman a man but she's used to that the Lord was making our use of that ear there's not many like that all the time but but there are a few ear and there who wage and are very very young a man in what they do and how they do it as I said she would have been 96 just shortly before the Lord called her all a man and as I said she never complained and we knew there was something wrong but she would never admit it and you know of course when we praise the Lord God give us faith a man brother faith but season to get faith you got to recognize grace a man and it's like I said and most everyone would and in fact they did laugh at her in the hospital when they asked her why she why she came to the hospital we took her to the emergency and they said why are you here and she wouldn't even tell them she said because they brought me a man so it's so oh so the nurse the nurse laughed at her oh she said that's why you're here yes she said and so they sent her home again and that would that was out of Saturday on a Tuesday she went into a stroke they mad but you know what no not a Saturday he was done a another day Monday yeah on Tuesdays one's a stroke but was on the Saturday before that Monday she she was she was conscious of eternity she was conscious that she was going somewhere because it's on a Saturday she called us into the into the room the living room and she asked forgiveness for have any where she said I have offended jizz anywhere I've been a problem to you she said I want you to forgive me she says and she wanted to settle all that all those issues because she lived with us for 28 years and we of course were were helped to them even to mr. Dunford a man so she did that she was getting right with God a man on a Saturday she cleared everything out and then on Tuesday shared the stroke and ten days later she the Lord took her home but she was ready to go she greeted and him it anybody that came into the hospital of course she she she she could wave one hand the other one was paralyzed but the other one she she would smile and she's take your hand she squeezed your hand and another time I went in with a tape and I let her hear the tape of old the old compassion gospel hymns and she loved it oh you could see you could see that her countenance changed when I when I put the earphones in her ear and played the these these hymns oh she loved it a man all time with the peace of God I knew she wasn't afraid no she was ready you know heart she was ready to go so we're looking forward to seeing her sister I said right there right there she's just right there with sister coffee and just young women and they're waiting on us old people a man to get at a time and into eternity by the grace of God so grace or sister and grace to our brother Leo's mother and grace to brother Sammy's mother a man in praying grace that they're looking forward to eternity where a man blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah brothers sister there has to be a God because there's no way that we did that man could come up with all of the things I written in this book there's no way that a man could come up with those ideas but and people think it is just dreaming a dream or fairytales no way brother this is divine this is this is eternal this come from eternity and it's going to eternity a man so it's an eternal being brother had to come up with all of these thoughts and reveal it so I pray the grace of God help us amen

to bring the resurrection and the rapture to pass in our lives amen we're going from time to eternity because we believe now amen not tomorrow now and that's what God is asking us to do it's the present tense because God is not past God is not future God his presence amen by the grace of Almighty God amen turn with me to the book of Romans chapter 8 a man praise the Lord hallelujah and pray the grace of God to bless us in the reading of his word and beginning to read at verse 14 notice verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus amazing absolutely amazing to them that are in Christ Jesus not with him but in him and it says who walk not after the flesh to many believers are walking after the flesh amen they're living after the flesh amen they're controlled by the flesh but the sons of God the daughters of God they walk after the spirit and it says who walk not after the flesh you can't be in Christ and walk after the flesh amen it says but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus and made me free from the law of sin and death amen they can condemn us organs it's the Holy Ghost in control for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh Amen God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh the grace of God that the righteousness of the law amen the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God amen God's gracious those that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God not by the Spirit of the devil they are the sons of God led by the Spirit of God and a person can be led by the Spirit of the devil and think that he's led by the Spirit of God because it is so closer we deceive the very elect if possible for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear thank God for that grace but he have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen the spirit and that's the life of the blood the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit then we are the children of God amen trust you have that confirmation in your experience in your life the Holy Ghost itself bearing witness with our spirit than we are the children of God a man having the nature of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with I told Lorie if she'll be that we suffer with him if so be that we suffer with him god help us we think that Christianity Oh everything is going to be good God is going to make it all easy for me I'm gonna have no worries none of there's none of that no suffering it's the beginning a man because we come into the trial of our faith better and the trial of our confession and if children then heirs heirs of God joint heirs with Christ and if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together a million this is the grace of God amen for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us by the images on the glory the revelation of eternity and eternal life not on the suffering a man for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope and that's the hope with expectation of fulfillment because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption hallelujah hallelujah into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit the firstfruits of the Spirit amen they run to the law and the spirit without sight but under grace Jesus said that perfect blood and brought the life back into us Christ in us the hope of glory amen so not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit amen so now he's working Christ out in us eternal life out of you and me by the grace of God amen the changes from creatures of time to creatures of eternity a man and even we ourselves all even we ourselves groan within ourselves how many are groaning within themselves a man why growth within our son we're saying yeah but we're growing crisis groaning to get out of this body he was groaning to get out of time and now he's in earth and groaning to get us at a time but groaning to get us out of this body and into a glorified body like is glorious body amen brother this is what he's been working on working out all down to the church agents bringing us to that perfection amen so he said even we ourselves groan within ourselves and oh my god at mercy but I pray that we got the Holy Ghost to the extent that we're bearing the burden of the word for this hour amen and it causing us to groan within ourselves to get out of here amen by the grace of Almighty God and we are waiting praise the Lord for the adoption we got the spirit of adoption any man and his crying and groaning for that full adoption a man and he said waiting for the adoption to know it says to wit it means to know full adoption ain't man and to know the redemption of our body amen that is full adoption because we're going to have a body like is glorious money amen we got his spirit in us that's the spirit of adoption but now we're going into full adoption anybody this is see the brothers I want you to understand that this is grace the grace of God working in you and me through the word and it's God fulfilling his word God bringing his word to pass doing what he promised to do from the beginning everybody thought was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world brother is coming to passing you and me amen by the grace of Almighty God he said to know the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man cioth wide other you know for we're going by faith not by sight amen but if we hold for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it grace grace grace but we're living by grace by the grace of God and likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought don't pray for what the flesh wants pray for what God wants what's the will of God in your life the vast majority of people today so-called Christians they're living according to what they want not what God wants anybody not mud like Jesus said not my will father don't be done if there's ever a generation got me in the will of God it's the in time generation any way to experience the resurrection of rapture brother day old my grace that you're gonna get the victory over the devil get away Satan you're trying to convince me that this is the will of God I want the will of God off pain the will of God God will reveal his will to me in my heart amen it'll be a conviction a connection a connection on the inside of the inside anybody garlic event to this to the annual reason and since this incense no I can't see that beam dual of God oh well we don't think is will of God is the will of God and I but the flesh is contrary to is the will of God God is going to try our faith want to bring the flesh something to him everybody plate the good fight of faith so likewise the spirit also have with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit is sent making intercession for us with groanings which groanings again oh I don't see many believers groaning and also believe many believers were that anointing in their lives and into hearts and in their souls thank God he saved me and he's doing with this he's doing that ya know he wants to do it through you now God do this and God do that and yeah but he wants he wants he wants to get in you and do it anyway he wants to get in you and live out the word he wants to get in yo and reveal the word he wants to get in you and turned the flesh into the word into a glorified body and bring forward the resurrection in rapture a man now they're saying oh let's who said this in a moment but look with the problem that Jesus had in his first coming but what and at the end when he when he when he was fulfilling the ministry that he had a merit show this way and he went to his disciples and they were sleeping slaving here was the errors the hour of the resurrection and arrived sir amen he was going to lay down his life raised again and rapture the old says no Saints enter that his label say they're so interested they went and dozed and slept he's Ashley bones take a rest he knew what was coming any bad but they were sleeping naturally this generation is sleeping spiritually oh yeah many a believer today many a so-called Christian today their savings largely because they're not airing the Word of God they never heard Jesus do to the disciples and they're not hearing him now but the thing of it is brother if you don't hear him now their destination is hell their God has something else for there were those disciples there's 2000 years left of history but now we're at the end of time amen so I pray the grace of God don't sleep spiritually amen let's be awake hey man to the Word of God I wake to the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen brother they think this they think this they think that but in this last day they go to sleep and he that search of these are the hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because he made an intercession for the saints grace of God listen he make it intercession for the Saints oh well I'm going to ask God and man the Spirit is gonna make intercession I'm going to get it no it's according to the will of God not your will not my real father don't be done anybody and brother's not just this our even in Luther's our Wesley's our any any time that God got a hold of the Saints is they submitted to his will like that brother that that was they were they were stretching and stretching and stretching during the during the Dark Ages and he was laying down his life for the gospel and but they stretched him and stretched him and just tearing apart under finally he was smiling oh and they serve oh stop stop stop stop Nishant what's wrong with you he said nothing he said don't don't don't stop they say one don't stop don't you feel anything no he said isn't it there was an angel standing right there waiting for him amen might even explore it not his glorified body but it's the Alpha knee buddy and everybody so he said keep on going even he wanted to go hey man how many want to go and Ernie would would face the challenge of that woman when they said to her if you don't worry if you don't recant of that faith and what they're preaching and teaching they said we're gonna kill your child her little girl and she said kill her and she said I'll meet her in glory a man killed her a leader in glory amen and I believe that they killed her and killed the child killed her too and now they're in glory amen by the grace of God God elbows her lay down our lives they lay down there's naturally how oh if we can made on ours you know for the will of God he made what God requires of us according to his will so he said finish with this verse and he that searcheth the hearts knowing what is mind of the Spirit the Holy Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God god bless his words you may be seated and turn with me to Philippians chapter 3 in the in the Christian walk there's no no way no time with that without suffering amen if you're going to really take your stand as a Christian for the Gospels sake and for Jesus sake amen there's something you got to endure a man because not the whole world is not is not going to believe not going to accept your testimony they're going to consider you to be a fanatic and brother Brent has challenged us for being a fanatic for Jesus and a fanatic for the gospel of fanatic for the revelation of the word in this our brother all down through the ages those that stood for guard will consider fanatics amen summer consider fanatics bye-bye believers summer consider fanatics by other Christians a million but they didn't care they took their stand for the gospel that they're staying for the revelation of the word amen for what God was doing in their day and in their hour and brother that was the grace of God in their lives brother there's there's there's some sauce right here that I that I had in a message the night that I went through some years ago and I believe that when I finished this message I asked these questions and just let me go and run run through it and I said who are you a man who are you why are you under the grace of God or under the under the judgment of God and I said who are you are you Adam or are you Eid a man are you able or you came a man remember there although that are concerning these right here that they're all religious they all had the revelation of God they all knew then there was a car they all knew that God was God and there was one gone a man it is not like this world believes in three gods when it comes to a Trinity but that's alright if it was back some years ago but not in this day and in this hour because God has revealed himself as as the one true Living God by brothers sister back here through the scriptures this one believed God that wouldn't believe God but but again the only this one had the grace of God and the other one didn't one came under the grace of God and received the grace of God and the mercy of God whereas the other one experienced the gentleman of God a man sir are we Adam or are we Eve are we able or where we came a man remember again over I'm not saying that I go to church I thought I came because I'm religious was so Biscayne came when the church came was religious a man and so are we able or are we came oh but I prefer I prefer as I preached the gate a and by our having you some years ago what church would you go to would you go to a way to go to able church or change search now remember they had a church and most would go to go to Cannes Church because Cain church wasn't it was nice and brother if you want to see Cain church you wait for Thanksgiving Day a man right and you wait for the Thanksgiving Day and you go to this church and that person this church with that church oh my and the altars are filled with with with fruits and vegetables and I get some flowers as well and brother that was exactly what Cain was offering on his altar to the Lord it was what he had grown over there what he had done are there but Abel never offered that hey will never win Cadence's cane would you will you give me alternative what cane I'll give you some sheep or some lambs and you give me some of the vegetables are grown for me to put on the altar to God no he didn't do that but rather he went out by faith and he had the more excellent paint now again it's understand that there there is excellent faith and there is more excellent faith a man by the Bible says he had a more excellent faith well if he had more excellent Cana excellent amen oh that was good King you and I don't you sacrifice all of this to give to the Lord but God refused it a man by the air but ere is Cain are able rather and eagle's head he takes a lamb and he kills it amen and maybe slicing the lad the Lambs throat and they let all the blood come out on the altar and no doubt he led the blood come out upon him because he knew that this was where this was redemption was would would be in the blood but that blood only covered his sin he never took away you seen a man because the life of the land could not come into him he was a human being and the lamb was an animal a Maya and that was one long effort here every had another life so that's why they were waiting on the promise of God to come and said that perfect sinless blood that He shed in Jesus Christ so the life of that individual Jesus could come back on you and me and not only come back on us but to come back in us hey man praise the Lord so that he would put his life in honest I'll be with you even in you he said till the end of the age praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so again as I say where which church with would they go to most are going to cane Church but there are very few that are going to able search there are very few that are identifying a man with the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and how to identify with the blood of Christ not just to say I believe that he said is about 2000 years ago no you got the evidence you got the Holy Ghost you got the life of the bloody you a man this is the evidence that blood was shed for you because the life of that leg comes back to the true believer the life of that blood blood comes back to the seat of God a babe oh I pray God tonight that that era this assembly and those representing this assembly that they have the life of the blood in their a man brothers not just the revelation of the intellectual message in your head it's the life of the blood in your heart a man is God living out the message is God living of the word it's God by grace in you through the blood of Jesus amen Andy what's he doing he's fulfilling the scriptures he is bringing the parents what is promised for this day in our hallelujah my brother sister what was said in the Ministry of a prophet and in the third pole and in the OB of the word it was to bring us to perfect faith he said for the rapture and he said we had to come to this for the rapture amen by the grace of Almighty God hallelujah brother and we were going to turn ourselves over we want to we want to be in the right church a million not the devil sirs we want to be in the Church of God any man we want to be we want the life not nada not of Joseph fruits and vegetables and in the world and the foolishness of the world we want the life of Jesus the life of our Lord Jesus Christ in us amen proving that he died for me proving that he died for you amen and brother and now all of our sins are washed away the sink to sake that nurse and Jesus through the shedding of his blood and us receiving the life of the blood when you repent and you're baptized and God give receives your faith and gives you the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost is the life of the blood what does he do eat your completely righteous amen he imputes the righteousness of grace to you and your sins are washed away and the Bible says there in the sea of God's forgetfulness amen brother only God could do that a man this is grace grace grace grace only God could do that brother the devilry condemns us the devil astride they're there to convict us amen or you do this you do that you know and you got this you got that I saw get thee behind me Satan hey man I swear I might have this I might have that in something else but I turn to this I got Jesus anybody its Christ in me the hope of glory amen and that is the grace of God Christ as in me through the life of his blood amen he said I'll be with you even in you amen so I pray that we have that testimony we have that witness yeah you got it in your heart in your soul Christ amen not not not the religion of Christ or the intellectual knowledge of God Christ in your heads and I know about Christ I know he did this I know he did that and you know and God said this and God said that amen brother does how does it affect your life is they controlling your life a man is where are you controlling it are you controlling the word or is the word controlling you amen brother there was Judas that tried to control the word oh yeah and he because why as I mentioned I have to wonder brethren that because Judas won't what a a wonder force Jesus you know to deliver the Jewish wrong the ruling of their of the Romans nation and so on brother as it was back then they're going to come under the same the same control even in this hour it was a political Roman back then and in this hour is going to be political and religious amen movement powers that will control the world Jesus came there to deliver them from their sheds amen and Jesus came to deliver us on our sins and get us back to eternity that's whether just what the Jews needed that's what you and and but Jesus came to the Gentiles to provoke Israel to jealousy brother our children is just tremendous things going on in Israel all brother is more going on in Israel we really realize hey man you can see a lot when it comes to the internet and what's going on in Israel even and I understand that then maybe that Netanyahu who has been a was the the leader of Israel for ten years that apparently he's been voted in for another five years a man but in this in this part of his reign in Israel there there apparently there there's what's going to take control or what's going to partly influenced what he does and doesn't do he spirit something spiritual and again I saw that somewhere on you know in an email that I received amen but this brother because why because Israel and more and more they're beginning to want to focus on Messiah amen the Messiah because the Jews had believed for for four thousand years six thousand years looking for the Messiah to come amen because they that's that's who a balloon represented Ava's name represented the Messiah hey man that was the calm and going to shed his blood amen for Israel and for you and me by the grace of God as grace Mother Alleluia all grace in the mind of God I get to it in a moment here his grace in the mind of God before he said in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth Eggman period any man was grace after that no grace was before that amen because grace was a part of the character of God any minute grace for the part of the nature of God and grace is a brother I tell you it is when we're we're saying that man filled with the Holy Ghost and you in Christ become one anybody where we are saying that kept by the power of God through faith on to full salvation complete salvation amen and it has God at us by the grace of God amen brother sister and grace grace is May fleshing you grace is made flesh and me the grace of God a man God because God grace was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and brother when main fellow hallelujah buddy their project and the character of God hallelujah whether the effect of the character of God it affected Greece any man it put grace into action in the character of God because grace was a part of the character of God before he created me before he created the earth a man in His grace who he was yes definitely brother sister doe the plan of God and the mercy of God and the grace of God and what God did and why God did it oh my brother sister oh I I was thinking about the scriptures and God said I created a good and evil that's what he said I created a good and evil why did he do that he had a plan amen brothers are bringing out hallelujah hallelujah they bring out his character amen to bring out the character of it all these sons and daughters to bring out the character of his bride a man because by with the body because of the devil he said you walked up and down in the coals of fire and when it comes to me that's the author of fire in glory amen he was a covering cherub mother says that you were you were perfect until pride iniquity was found in his heart a man God permitting it brother sister God sea pearl my brother's is this there's no accidents here Amen if there's an accident were out of the will of God and under the will of the devil amen this is what happened in the garden of Eve was not an accident whatever in the garden indeed wasn't something yes surprise God and you know it's titled God oh wow oh you did this oh my I wasn't expecting this and so on no no no no no no God God knew because he's omniscient he knows all things anybody before he created he knew what was going to happen but he did it he had a plan and he had a purpose and he had a pattern any man and brother and Ava Ava recognized the plan the purpose a pattern just recognizer to the extent that you and I see it but he did have a revelation of it a night it was my faith this by faith by baby booze 11 praise the Lord hallelujah so everybody pay now brother sister right on down right on down now it's my faith you and me anybody they went on they went on they went on they were on but it says that but they without us should not be made perfect amen brother see if one thing we ought to recognize in all what has gone come to pass through this through history the last six thousand years anything that we ought to recognize is Grace it is the grace of God and we all give us a give you an understanding and an explanation of what is Grace most of us understand it is unmerited favor it goes deeper than that hey man it goes deeper than that and we think grace began in Genesis after the fall of Adam and Eve grace goes back before Genesis amen as I explained that a grace was there when Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord in Revelation there the light the last verse grace amen brother His grace comes in grace takes us out and we go in amen there was a prayer of God's character spread of ours a man praised the name of the Lord but it's eternal it's eternal brother brother sister so what church play as I said would you prefer to go cane or evil most are in Cain's church they don't realize it but during Cain's search that's the truth they're offering their sovereign that but I'm reoffer in their lives I don't they don't lay their lives down as Jesus ladies down however many are suffering brother Gospels sake as Jesus suffered and the slower in the last days because the prophet of God brother he considered the last days you know what he thought he thought he was losing his mind that's right and he also thought he said I thought there I felt like I'll have to go to a doctor and get some anti dip oh yeah he felt that way yeah he went to brother Jack more each time I losing my mind he went doing winter sister Branham and and if anybody would it would help helping donors Devon will be his wife and he said am I losing my mind because he was so caught up with the word any man the word of God and he saw so much when it comes to the negative things that was contrary to the word and was getting worse and worse and worse a night not just that into the world but even in his own church because as I say in that message how can I overcome and he preached embrace the bridge and I quoted where he said they said where brother BAM I'm nights more you're gonna preach this he thought he preached it until you stop doing it and that was his own church what we as I said and let me say the game anyway by the grace of God to say this they put us on our guard brothers are profitable to come back he wouldn't he wouldn't be he wouldn't be focusing on that O'Dare religion he be focusing on the message that's right repaired repaired repaired because every time God sent the Prophet he sent him with a message of repentance he made every time they came to Israel brickhead and that's what Ava was doing repenting but King wouldn't do it Cain was gonna blame God everybody and brother that's what the devil was trying to go to do with Adam and Eve had to do this and do this now oh he was saying he was he was accusing God of lying and B not being honest with that of a need that's the truth and that the old brother sisters don't listen to the devil listen to God every man you try to get P even believers today the thing that God has being dishonest God has not been honest God's not being right with me and so on he won't tell me this won't tell me that amen brother sister that's where they he said all he said to eat always the yes God saying but what abuts belong to goats they but the sheep don't but they man brothers sister he but but he said I say unto you he didn't say they wouldn't die he said thou shall not surely die but he said you shall be as God's knowing good and evil that they didn't need to know because the grace of God is gonna take us back to where we don't we only know good amen there will be no knowledge of sin amen because the atmosphere is gonna be totally righteous this is grace brother all brothers sister God Elvis I realize that is not just grace two thousand years ago when Jesus died and now we're preaching the were saved by grace now you got a I am oh yes you're saved by grace amen it's the grace of God because Jesus did this and Jesus did that yeah but what about how do i how do I get what Jesus did I know I become a part of what Jesus did well by the grace of God you repent yeah well that right what do you mean not many repenting today that's right brother sister many are repenting of their repentance sorry I didn't have to do that all I do is say I believe I believe that that's it that's right David Lee oh I believe God I believe what Jesus did and thank you Lord and then go on and do us right in their own eyes amen that's what is for day that it was right in their own eyes in the wilderness but how many was was I would that wouldn't die but it but it Josh Makeda was was groaning and moaning and oh my we want to get into the lane come on but again listen oh my god allow allowed that in what they saw in the land God allowed it amen though when it comes to the the Giants and the big cities and in the walled cities and everything else brother a guy got it out bring out what was in these lines what was in those Jews that came out of Egypt any man but not only to bring out what was in there but to bring out what was in Joshua on Caleb glory hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah grace of God brother a man to Joshua and Caleb a man they all they all did these went in these went in and they come out said no we can't go in because of this Joshua and Caleb said oh yes we can go in and God be for us who can be against us amen this is the hour of the resurrection of rapture oi you don't expect that now do you because why Amen listen father the brother/sister they lack the anointing that Joshua and Caleb had in their in their hearts and and the anointing that was on their been around them they believed god this is it is by grace through faith that they went in possess the land but the others rejected that grace they never a acknowledge that grace and to receive the faith that that grace would give them not realizing I think they ain't not thinking that I need grace that I need the Lord's help I'm going to just trust the Lord and I'm gonna depend on God amen oh they didn't know that but God allowed all of that in the end they in the promised land what for to bring out the unbelief that was in them a man and brother we're in an hour right now oh my brother sister EVER an hour that God is going to make manifest the faith that's in the bride it's this age the great and and brother don't think is it's not grace it is grace it is Grace to bring us out to bring out the revelation to bring out the faith that we what we want right now that we need right now amen Cherie what's he working on he's working on on the flesh he's working on get rid of the flesh kill the flesh hey man I want I want I want to control you not your flesh don't let your flesh come for yes - devil amen so glad see this is the grace of God they got in this hour the shades are the Obie of the word so they're private and let us know how the enemy is going to attack us how the enemy is going to work in US and through us and how that God is going to work in US and through us that God is going to work in our souls maybe we repent and we're baptized and God receives our faith and gives us the Holy Ghost brothers now on us is heinous amen brother but the devil is there and he's going to each going to work on us his babies when he's going to be as the prophet of God said he said God's watchtower is your soul and he said but the devil's watch how he said he says go me in your money amen because we're born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and so on and then and so and what's in the mind it's all and what goes on in the mind our mind is acting and reacting all depends on what you see taste feel smell in here that's right on those senses what as the part of God reminded us thank God he said but that but just the the sense of the soul he says only got once to soul only got one sense and he's what's that he says faith every man no boy because the devil was cast out Jesus came in anybody the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God in you and it goes by grace through faith hallelujah it is the grace of God in you it is the grace of God within his word it is the grace of God revealing his will and brother sister let's understand this that when it comes to God Rivini ins will by grace revealed as well it's not just spiritual the revelation of the will of God in your life is to control your life the will of God in your life the revelation of it in your soul is to give you victory over the devil amen you got Satan is going to work on your senses and he'll come down through your Satan and your senses and your flesh and into your human spirit amen but then if you got the Holy Ghost Satan begins to move with the word and he and he'll move from the soul with the revelation of the word into your spirit and rate and he and he forces the devil back into your mind a man and to neutralize what the devil is trying to get you to believe amen that's what the pilot of God said he said as if this is the battle we're in a war we are in a war and brother it's not just a war with what's going on out there in the world it's the war what's going on right here in this flesh ain't meaning there's too many believers brother too many things oh I'm fighting against that out there I got a you know when I go to work I gotta fight those spirits and when I go when I go out shopping I gotta fight those spirits when I eat sometimes even ate with family I gotta fight those spirits yeah but the greatest battle you got is within this flesh within your flesh because the enemy is attacking yo brother right here with your census oh yeah and more and more giving into Satan's census oh yeah there and there living to please the flesh there living to satisfy the flesh but brother I pray grace that we're going to have the faith that Abel had that by the grace of God it brother oh by faith able to dis by faith Enoch did this by faith Noah did this amen but it's the grace of God hey man brother sister again just just just to prove it amen it says Noah walked with God but again Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord brother if Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord walked with God he knocked on grace in the eyes of Lord and anybody and look at the faith that that grace gave him the other faith my brother by grace that he had that God showed her you know and any what with God and walk with God while with God and he just lived for garden then for God and no doubt no doubt he had a lot of a lot of people they're kinda accusing him of being a fanatic why because he went and did what he had to do for his family but then he concentrated on God on God on God Oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord and he knew what had happened no doubt in the Garden of Eden you know and so on and and where that it all started with the racism of God and the and the love of God oh praise the name of the Lord he walked with God and it says that no matter what he did he said God was in control amen he didn't go out and do this because his mind see in his mind in his mind no it was the Spirit of God leading him he knew that he want whatever he wanted whatever he did he wanted to please God whatever he did he want to give God the preeminence he wanted to give God the glory a man do it all for the grant for the great glory of God amen that was the grace of God in Enochs life grace and he walked with God was not because God took him a man and Greg and Noah and Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord and he walked with God hey man and God delivered him and we find grace in the eyes of God will walk with God but to walk with God you got to give God pre evidence and sometimes God's gonna do things that that you that physically is all that's foolish you don't have to do that God don't want you to do that oh yes God does this want to do that to bring out something else amen to test you here to test you there tester somewhere else see he got got nowhere to do this to bring out what was in the rest of the world hey come out amen and he brought it what was in Noah brothers sister hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it had never rained on the earth before and here he was here is God coming down and giving by faith giving no of this revelation there was going to it was gonna rain and I just rained but it was gonna rain so much that God was going to flood the earth a man named me and the brothers sister to the mountains or whatever amen everything was gonna be covered right no you're crazy yeah he was in the eyes of the world oh we don't maybe because why it's just they didn't they felt they didn't need rain that they'd never had rain so brother Noah where'd you get that idea to i've ever seen a film one time and Noah's wife said 200 she said yeah no I was just thinking when the flood comes what are we gonna do to protect our house to keep it from leaking and that was just something they put in the film it well they got our attention to the reality of the flood a man to bring to do - to confirm Noah's testimony to confirm is faith by the gray suit by the grace of God all brother god help us is my prayer so are we are we a diverter eat are we able Akane I'll be Enoch or Noah are we able him or a lot are we Isaac or Ishmael are we Jacob or Esau that's tremendous because in the eyes of the world they would love Jacob Esau oh he saw was good he was good to his father oh my he went out hunting Andrey would bring food back to them and feed the family but Jacob didn't but Jacob had something in his heart all he wanted the birthright yes but what was in the birthrate it wasn't just possessions because in the birthright he didn't he wasn't just responsible for the land and the houses and and and and any if they had any money or whatever they oh no no he was to be God's representative oh yeah he would answer to God he would have to enforce this spiritually and so on amen they but but he saw he was the spiritual he was caught up with the natural things of life by God it's a generation that's caught up with the natural things god help us rather be needing a cutout with their spiritual then there are such things they're not going to rapture us but the spiritual will that's why we need to get caught up with that and it'll catch us in the glory it is by grace through faith my God have mercy on us amen again as we called in someone has called it back to me tender a cottage why should I care they're building a mansion for me over there God have mercy on us brother because I'll tell you it's a world that it's a world that wants this and wants that and wants something else they wants the things of the world more than they want the things of God god help us brothers sister are we Jacob or Esau amen it was the grace of God in Jacobs life brother old grace oh yeah because he wrestled with the angel God got oh my praise the name of the Lord my lord my lord God's ways are not our ways as well as well we got to make the sacrifice hey man it takes a sacrifice brother because god oh the God allowed this to happen with Jacob and Esau Garlin honor to heaven why because Jacob had to leave and Jacob had to go down there and that's where his wife force amen and through that woman he would have those sons Isaac that's doing amen by the grace of Almighty God and brother then then God would reveal this to him and he would on his way back but what did he do he met God he and he fought with the God brings God allows things in your life sometimes but then you end up fighting fighting the good fight of faith amen amen and joshua fought have fought and fought because he was afraid of esau he was afraid that he saw was going to attack him which says he was but had all changed and jacob went off into the mountain alone and Harry Met met it met the Mangel and they fought and fought and fought and fought and the angel said Jacob they're no longer Jacob they man you're no longer this your longer that brother brothers sister God changed our names by the grace of God so brother I pray grace that we are it was grace and Jacob's life oh yeah grace all the way down through we are sinners saved by grace that's right repent be baptized get the life of the blood in you you're seeing this in the eyes of God and the mind of God's forgotten and you and your righteous what your righteous I trust I'm looking at those who had the righteousness of Christ in them a man say God's not looking at your flesh he's looking at your heart hey man God is not looking at you what you're doing outwardly in your flesh but what really motivates you in your heart what spear is in your heart what anoint is in your heart is it grace of God based on the faith of God the revelation of the will of God for your life or are you doing what's right in your own eyes most are doing what's right in their own eyes because I tell you most I'm not going to take the will of God now okay you know why reasoning or if I do this this if I do that this Oh but faith doesn't do that thesis believes God does it because Lord you're gonna bless me anyhow amen you're going you're gonna bless me you're going to encourage me you're gonna be with me you're gonna protect me Amen thank God little brother it is by grace through faith and you're not there's no salvation no other way faith what is faith the revelation of the will of God well that's the word yeah it's the word but it's the word to have taken effect in your life it's the word living itself out through you not doing your will you're doing these will so are we Jacob are Esau are you Joseph or his elder are you Moses or Dathan mine are you Jesus or Judas yeah are you the wise virgin or the foolish virgin see so close to it would to see the very elect impossible we better get into and surrender to the grace of God amen and by the grace of God we have that extra oil yes sir are we the wise version or the foolish virgin are we sheep or goats no there's a lot to scopes oh yeah they but-but-but-but-but you given the word and it's all but but but but did no buts is a man the goat the mutt but the Sheep lame aim that's right by the grace of God so are we believers or make believers a man we'll bring some of those things over we will be getting the message the anointing ones at the end time my brother the thing that that God exalts and magnifies in all you know all the scriptures you know all the words from Genesis to Revelation and all that God does the thing that's magnified his grace amen because it was the grace of God as it was in the days of Noah and it was the grace of God in the days of Abel at the grace of God in the days of Abraham go read a Bruce 11 and you see it says by faith by faith by faith well you could read by grace through faith by grace through faith amen it is by grace through faith were saved it is by grace through faith that Abel did what he did it is by grace through faith that we're doing what we do and they without us will not be made perfect amen Hebrews 11 old brothers sister what Oh grace people take it too lately all they do not not acknowledging the greatness of it there's the sincerity of it the righteousness of it not exalted not acknowledging the royalty of it because why it's a part of the character of the king of kings and Lord of lords amen gracious just not some either oh it came when when God when it went at him and he sitting in the garden so God grace no the grace was there before God came Grace was there before rather out of a need deep what they did hey man it was the grace of God do you know you mean to tell me you think that God didn't know we're out of it Eve was they met God every day and fellowship with him till this day they didn't so God began God went down to the garden no doubt he was ever theophany of Jesus Christ because they saw him they saw and it was this theophany body that he would later come in flesh and lay down his life force so they softened they said where are you Adam any bro but they had wrapped themselves into the branches and got into the trees and hid themselves brother God knew where they were no way of hiding from God you were there is your thought your words your deeds you can't hide it from God God sees your thoughts God's it here's your words and God sees your deeds God hears and sees what you don't hear and see what you think is good God thinks is bad amen God's looking for grace through faith in the life you live grace shall say whether it's in your job whether it's in your school no matter where it is among your family your friends your neighbors you're gonna live out the life you are in Jesus no matter where he was he stated the word sometimes he didn't say much but they knew who he was but he wasn't afraid to speak the truth he was the truth and you are the truth you know if there's Christ in you then you're the truth as a part of God brought out in that message we heard that tape he says your gods your gods to whom the word of God has come amen the Word of God in you and Christ in you makes you a son of God daughter of God we are the sons and daughters of God by the grace of God grace I wanted I'm I'm trying to get it across to you to understand that grace is not just or grace - it just started it and that's it that's fine I don't have to worry about it no more no no grace is twenty-four hours a day grace come from eternity brings eternity in us takes us back to eternity by the grace of God it is great because I feel that too often people people that just take grace for a moment that's winning when they get saved or when they get baptized and some who believed in the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost and so on or that's it and I go down and they do what's right in their own eyes no no now you're gonna live for Jesus live for god you're going to you're going to endure for the Gospels sake suffering well brother I mean he really would want to do it not many because they think Jesus did it all so I don't have to do it that's not according to the word that's a lie of the devil how many want to suffer for the gospel see I tell you brother down through the ages when God moved and they stayed with God and did what God wanted to do where he wanted them to do it how he wanted them to do it they suffered they endured grace in Ephesians chapter 3 sorry oh gosh and in verse 7 no I'm sorry Philippians 3 Philippians chapter 3 after Ephesians and verse 7 what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ we all got it in our minds must gain what we want we want more of this more of this more of this more of that no no we want the will of God a man and what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ and yeah doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things what have we suffered in taking our stand for the truth and he said I do count them but dung what Oh should think that well it is when you consider the light of God and hold my the glory of God and what's going on in this world what's going on this world is dumb he said for whom I have suffered the loss of all things food he suffered a loss for Christ and he said I did camp them but down today they don't want to count that down oh no no that's too good I like that I want that well as far as God is concerned you can have the dog and I'll cast you out with the dome he said that I may win Christ amen look II gotta do to win Christ look what you got to do oh my oh my the disappointments in the Judgment surprise who made it surprise I didn't make it because why the ones that didn't make it wasn't willing to pay the price wasn't willing to forsake all things for Jesus sake considering what he did they weren't willing they weren't willing to do what he did they weren't willing to sort of match it now he wasn't the soft did lay down their lives as I said 68 million during the Dark Ages lay down their lives but how many gonna lay down their lives naturally when it comes to the world the things of the world because remember again the Bible says if you love the world the order of the world and the things of the world the love of God not in you and it comes to loving the world doesn't necessarily mean the sinful things of the world but the things that is gonna distract you from the things of God what's more important this life of the world who would this world of the world at home or eternity most are satisfied with living in this world but you got the Holy Ghost they knew had the attitude Jesus said how long should I be in this world why he said no matters to send it up but he that came down even those on a man who is who is than heaven where are you are you there well Jesus said he was there he said I have no more in the world he said I come down and I and he said I'm up there and so on well he had Yetta Yetta theophany there we got our theophany there at the Alvin II body hey man I trust you do it we do they may and that we're not we're not going like like the rich man did he went and he lifted up his eyes in hell being in torment but at Lazarus lifted up his eyes at the bosom of a brain as I said I told that to her sister one time but what happens after you after you dies physically did if she didn't believe that that you you were conscious of anything and I said well this happened to this one this happened to that one day I went into the light but let the bosom of Abraham oh she said hey bread must have some big bosom I said yeah he does I said there's room therefore for every seat of God a man a man could the bloom of Abram was referring to the was what was in his heart and his soul in his spirit made man not his physical bosom no god help us brother it's his faith amen so what things were gain to me those I counted a loss for Christ did you and do you the things that this flesh wants more and more do you have that loss for Christ I give their glory and the preeminence to Christ not to that yay Dulles I count all things but loss for the excellency I count all things loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things now for the excellency of the knowledge or will that one interfere with my knowledge you said well you would think on that morn you think on Jesus and he said to count that they said but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not any might own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith amen verse 10 that I may know him do you know him that I may know him and the power of his resurrection don't stop there as I bill to be legen he's gone on as he I heard preach on one time and he said when we were in Pentecost he said we just read the first part of it period but he said when we got out we went on beyond that he said in Pentecost we wanted to know him in the power of his resurrection where there's a lot of message believers like that and they stopped there but he said go on and he said to know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings hmm and then II want that because if you're going to be into the word and stay with the word take your stand with a word you're going to suffer oh yeah the things you're gonna suffer the more you stand and I tell you the closer we get to the end the more you're gonna suffer because the hour is coming when when they'll take take those Bibles they they're not allowed in got him to the in Western world they got him took out of the schools in the United States does not allowed to be no Bibles are allowed no prayer they're not allowed to have any any science or any Christian signs on the walls and and and that now they started it in Quebec yeah and it's like one time in in in in the United States they they're in one school they were having a problem with thieves and they were stealing listed they said what in the world we're gonna do he's will he said I got a suggestion he said once your buddy sign there thou shalt not steal but they're not gonna do that because it's the scripture it's the Bible is a commandment oh you want to stop this put that sign there that was your now or it is written they'll say the Lord nope not gonna have it getting less and less spiritual as I said churches are getting smaller and smaller smaller yeah the numbers are going down down down god help us but brother the true elect a man no wonder the pot Oh God said he said there might be 300 he said he says that'll be on the earth to go in the rapture living Saints living Saints Oh what about a number that no man can number where they're already gone on and they're waiting on us and there's gonna be very very few living Saints through interruption didn't want had to faith they're refusing the third pole - that's ordained to bring us to the revelation of rapturing faith to get us to get out of here and go out remember Jesus laid down his life voluntarily and picked it up again now he's in us so we can pick it up but we gotta lay down their lives are in this world we got to put the rapture and give the rapture more preeminence than this life if you want to go you got to give preeminence to it oh but it's just going to happen no no no you you you prophet of God said God's waiting on us let's go let's go in the rapture grace of God so he said that I may know him in the power of his resurrection there rather that I may know him know him there's three things know him and the power is resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death that's tremendous know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain under the resurrection of the Dead amen and he said not as I'd already attained either already perfect but I follow after that if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ and brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus and brother were reaching forth unto those things which are it says before but there's a center reference there and it says we're reaching for those things that are up upward the rapture the resurrection by the grace of God I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus you have the press toward the mark by the grace of God grace the unmerited but freely given love and favor of God toward man brother don't forget that it includes the love of God and man is undeserving and unworthy of it in his flesh but God is looking at the art by grace amen let me finish with a quote of the Prophet and it was the message where I think Pentecost failed well there's many a believer failing and it says when you get over to heaven and you want to look me up I'll tell you where to find me they may he said there's a river of life running along there you see and there's some evergreen trees standing there and he said you know and they take the leaves off of them to heal the nation's and this was the devotion I think for today in brother Tim dodgiest brother Alec agrees for today and brother Tim Dodds devotional books and it said they take the leaves off of the trees then he said to heal the nation's and over on the other side there the angelic choir he says singing all the time great voices like horrible Einar Sankey and he said and you know and those other great men that's crossed over and he said well then over on this other side of the hill there's a little tree standing there and I'll be leaning back under that tree listening at them listening to them sing hee did you see oh if I could only sing I said there's one song that I always wanted to sing and loved it so well and that's amazing grace so he said when you all get over home and if you happen to go before me and you're living in your great big fine palace over there and he said you hear an echo coming across the hill somewhere and he said look over on the other side of the hill and you'll see might a little Hut he said you'll be there in your great big palace he said but you will hear an echo over on the other side of the hill and if you look over there you see my little Hut amen he said down there somewhere among the evergreens and Eastern I'm standing out on the front porch he said singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound and he said you say well praise God old brother branham finally made it yeah another place he said we could get over there and he said you'll hear a man singing Amazing Grace and he said you'll look around he said you'll see me sitting under the tree he said singing Amazing Grace oh thank God for that grace they man so he said I'll be over on the other side over there with Amazing Grace and if I ever get there it'll be amazing grace because His grace brought it for me bought it for me and I'm going by his grace alone all mine people think you know a little bit of work here work there as I tell you this through any works it's got to be the word it's not wor K s wo Rd and it's not wor des it's wor D there's a man Christ the word in the beginning was the word and the word just think John when he wrote about Jesus coming he didn't do like the others says well in Bethlehem and the angel came down to Mary and says you're gonna get your gun to do this you're gonna do the head taught and you're gonna give birth to this this child no praise the Lord don't wonder see that's John worth ordained of God predestinate of God he was going to write the book of Revelation a man the revelation that John had brother the revelation that you and I have it's real to us now in this last day but John he started he didn't he didn't go back to just Jesus was born and this and that and then no he said the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God amen and in the eastern end the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen he went back to eternity a man then come down to time in Redemption but it was to take us back to eternity by the grace of God all brothers sister thank God for the revelation I pray grace for brother sister amen that in this day in this hour we're not going to we're not going to speak as that maybe that denomination or that denomination or this one or that one's going to speak concerning our Lord Jesus Christ he did this and he did that no no we're gonna speak revelation 10 the mighty angel that came down from God with the rainbow over his head even our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of man it wasn't with him ran him he used with a random but it was our Lord Jesus Christ amen brothers tremendous and again in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not a man thank God that we comprehended the light the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world a man he was in the world of the world was made by him and the world knew him not and so on brother sister and the brightest in the world the world doesn't know her and that's why when the bride goes she won't be missed she did one know she's gone you'll remember he comes as a thief in the night and he taught it in the resurrection of rapture he's going to take the living Saints with him and brother we are the children of light children of the day none of the night so he's your tell him to take it and go and they won't know it says the thief in the night what we're walking in the light by the grace of God that's grace it's all grace I want you to understand that that it is all grace he said if I ever get there again the brother man I'm saying this he said if I ever get there it'll be amazing grace his grace brought it for me I'm going by grace alone and that's the way I trust it tonight and I know you do the same it is the grace of God as I ask you who are you Adam Eve Abel Cain brother the ones them the ones that are first they're the ones that knew and experienced the grace of God in their lives where there's Adam Abel Enoch Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses Jesus the wise virgins the Sheep and the true believer if there's anything they acknowledge is the grace of God a man we are saved by grace through faith oh well I got faith I got faith well you better act knowledge grace cut without grace there's no faith not not that pleases God remember the devil can give you this the devil can give you that but brother we need to faith that God that pleases God not the devil before the foundation of the world grace was predestinated to provide the Fallen race with the faith with the revelation wisdom and understanding of salvation needed to get back into fellowship with God as Adam aney was in the Garden of Eden they needed the revelation wisdom and understanding the Bible says get wisdom but get understanding they meant by the grace of God so it was before the foundation of the world that grace predestinated amen grace was predestinated to provide us with what we needed to get back because God knew that man was going to fall grace to us it is a gift of God the grace of God god bless you last and praised the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen let's sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me amen as one brother said when I get the glory
