[17:26] 11 36 it's already done
[17:29] i spent america open in prayer tonight
[17:31] and
[17:33] remember to pray for brother gerald as
[17:34] he brings the word tonight
[17:37] and we want to remember also the saints
[17:39] around the island around the world
[17:40] remember also about a car's church but a
[17:42] car and our
[17:44] brother uh every killer brother's name
[17:46] uh
[17:47] but
[17:48] all those that have the uh kovit
[17:51] trust that they're getting through it
[17:53] and uh remember also sister darlene
[17:56] guy david rowe as well and sister alice
[17:59] uh that back problem
[18:02] and also
[18:03] remember sister cordella and her son
[18:06] and those are with us tonight for the
[18:08] chad and family and
[18:10] sister blanca and some of the kids right
[18:14] jen said okay also i want to remember
[18:15] them tonight in prayer
[18:17] and also we had a
[18:19] request
[18:21] or an update i guess on sister laura
[18:22] collins
[18:24] and
[18:26] i won't read it all because it's quite
[18:28] long but it's a
[18:30] report from the nurse who is uh
[18:33] attending her looking after her who's
[18:35] also a believer
[18:37] uh but she has uh well she starts off by
[18:40] saying that it has been a difficult week
[18:42] for her
[18:43] and
[18:45] she said it's difficult to put into
[18:47] words
[18:48] uh but it's been an uphill battle for
[18:49] every inch of ground that they that
[18:53] that they've fought for this week
[18:55] uh so she describes her uh medical
[18:58] condition and things that have gone on
[19:00] so you know she's not able to take food
[19:02] or water through her mouth or anything
[19:03] like that she's having a difficult time
[19:05] but she is home and
[19:07] there are nurses that come by and help
[19:10] drain fluid from her liver
[19:14] and also by grace
[19:17] the
[19:18] christian doctor has taken over her care
[19:20] and
[19:21] she just she's he's described as very uh
[19:24] caring very loving so
[19:26] we thank the lord for that but uh she's
[19:28] also had uh discussions with palliative
[19:31] care doctors and uh
[19:33] they the doctor just gives her
[19:36] a couple of days a few days so we won't
[19:38] remember that but
[19:40] it ends off by saying that laura is very
[19:42] peaceful
[19:43] and trusting in the lord regardless
[19:45] regardless of the outcome so he has a
[19:48] really good attitude
[19:49] we are we are convinced together that
[19:51] nothing is too hard for uh for the lord
[19:54] our god
[19:55] and that
[19:57] now is the time that we expect him to
[19:59] come on the scene
[20:01] in the darkest of hours
[20:04] so it's and she said this is what we
[20:05] hold to and we give
[20:07] the glory to god
[20:09] so
[20:10] we just want to continue to pray for him
[20:12] i mean god is
[20:14] god is quite capable of providing a
[20:16] miracle
[20:18] and performing a miracle and we believe
[20:20] that we've seen miracles in our own
[20:22] lives i'm sure
[20:24] we've never had to go down to that level
[20:27] of course or experience that but god is
[20:29] still
[20:30] still able
[20:32] and
[20:33] i'll never forget you know what matt
[20:36] sent to me one time when i was dealing
[20:38] with the cancer and that is that
[20:40] what brother branham said that it's only
[20:42] cancer
[20:43] right so there's no sickness or no
[20:45] disease any greater than the promises of
[20:47] god i mean let's face it i mean god is
[20:49] greater right
[20:50] so he has a purpose for sister laura he
[20:53] has a purpose for all of us but he has a
[20:54] purpose for her for her going through
[20:56] this right
[20:57] and if nothing else what i'm seeing is a
[21:00] wonderful attitude to somebody who's
[21:01] who's dying and leaving a young family
[21:04] behind right
[21:05] that's how we see it but
[21:07] you know but god
[21:09] god's purpose be fulfilled
[21:12] his perfect will be accomplished for her
[21:14] and for her family so we want to
[21:16] remember her in prayer also
[21:18] uh
[21:19] brother everett uh just to give an
[21:22] update brother edward fell today he was
[21:24] going
[21:25] for a doctor's appointment and he fell
[21:26] in his graves and struck his head
[21:29] and so he ended up in hospital
[21:31] and he's there overnight but he
[21:33] so he needs stitches in his head
[21:37] and
[21:38] but he also hurt his neck in the process
[21:40] so that's why i think that's why they're
[21:42] keeping him in to see
[21:43] if just any effects from that
[21:45] so you know he's he's having his time as
[21:48] well so we want to remember brother
[21:49] everett
[21:50] uh
[21:51] god's grace to him
[21:53] again again there's a purpose for all of
[21:55] it right so we've got to believe that
[21:57] god's god's purpose is being fulfilled
[21:59] in all this
[22:01] it's already done the healing is already
[22:03] done let's believe that tonight

[51:40] it came back 2 000 years ago when jesus
[51:43] was on the scene and jesus said oh it
[51:45] came down to it yeah he tested them with
[51:47] his word and he said this and he said
[51:49] that oh brother and and
[51:52] many when he said except you eat the
[51:55] flesh and drink my flesh and drink my
[51:57] blood you have no life in you
[51:59] oh what
[52:01] and this was before he laid down his
[52:02] life before calvary amen and
[52:06] and
[52:07] the vast majority of the disciples that
[52:10] was following him they left
[52:12] they said who can receive this
[52:14] who can do this
[52:16] no no no so they walked away
[52:18] amen
[52:19] and again jesus said to the real
[52:21] disciples
[52:22] and they said well you also go
[52:24] and he said where can we go he said
[52:26] you've got the words of eternal life
[52:28] amen they didn't fully understand what
[52:30] he was saying amen but amen they
[52:33] believed that it was god in jesus amen
[52:37] so brother i trust by grace no matter
[52:39] what happens no matter what comes no
[52:41] matter what we experience brother we're

[1:19:22] god is doing it amen and the power and
[1:19:25] the anointing that god is using amen
[1:19:28] god is using this god is using that amen

[1:24:27] thing he said
[1:24:28] not my will thine be done
[1:24:31] amen what is the will of god for your
[1:24:34] life
[1:24:35] amen i tell you this there's many a
[1:24:38] believer amen does not in the will of

[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:02] you better you better be in the one
[1:25:04] that's good

[1:25:13] of god
[1:25:16] not my will thine be done
[1:25:18] but there's too many today amen they're
[1:25:21] not they're not seeking god's will they
[1:25:23] feel that well i want to do this i'm
[1:25:24] going to do this they feel that it's
[1:25:26] just natural
[1:25:27] no
[1:25:29] it might be natural do this natural do
[1:25:31] that but is it is is it god's leadership
[1:25:34] is it god's will
[1:25:36] well god help us
[1:25:38] not my will thine be done
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:43] so brother let's make sure that we are
[1:25:45] led by the spirit
[1:25:48] amen for as many as are led by the
[1:25:51] spirit of god they are
[1:25:53] the sons of god
[1:25:55] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:25:58] bondage
[1:25:59] again to fear
[1:26:01] but you have received the spirit of
[1:26:03] adoption
[1:26:04] whereby we cry
[1:26:06] abba father amen
[1:26:10] and the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:26:12] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:26:15] of god
[1:26:16] and if children then heirs
[1:26:19] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:26:22] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:26:25] that we may be also glorified together
[1:26:29] praise the lord
[1:26:30] if so be that we suffer with him amen
[1:26:34] are we willing to let go
[1:26:36] amen
[1:26:37] and follow his leadership we might think
[1:26:40] well if i go that way i'm going to have
[1:26:41] to suffer this and i'll suffer that
[1:26:43] we'll suffer it
[1:26:44] amen amen he suffered
[1:26:47] amen
[1:26:48] so if we suffer with him we will also be
[1:26:51] glorified with him
[1:26:53] praise the lord hallelujah is to
[1:26:56] identify he's identified with us we're
[1:26:58] identifying with him
[1:27:01] and again verse 18 for i reckon that the
[1:27:04] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:27:07] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:27:11] amen which shall be revealed in us god
[1:27:14] help us to believe it
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:16] brother amen let's get beyond religion

[1:27:32] a real a real a real personal experience
[1:27:35] with jesus
[1:27:36] amen not a religious experience amen
[1:27:39] like going into a church and you have
[1:27:42] experience with this one a natural
[1:27:43] experience with that one no we got a
[1:27:45] real experience with jesus amen it is a
[1:27:48] oneness
[1:27:49] amen oh brother i tell you it's so it uh
[1:27:52] what a what an experience that you can
[1:27:54] say it's not me that lives
[1:27:56] christ living in me
[1:27:57] what
[1:27:59] he's
[1:28:00] he's in your thoughts
[1:28:02] and he's in your words he's in your
[1:28:03] deeds he's in your actions and your
[1:28:05] reactions my
[1:28:07] are we so dead to ourselves and alive to
[1:28:09] him
[1:28:10] that we can say amen
[1:28:13] that is not me that lives is christ

[1:39:00] said it's not 12 feet from you at any
[1:39:03] given time

[1:39:40] you and it create created you he said a
[1:39:42] hunger amen oh and a longing to get to
[1:39:45] get out of time into eternity

[1:40:13] us in this hour in this age that because
[1:40:16] we're getting getting closer and closer
[1:40:18] to the resurrection closer to the
[1:40:19] rapture i believe our theophany is
[1:40:21] getting closer to us
[1:40:23] and it's going to stay closer to us
[1:40:26] amen because we got to step out of time
[1:40:29] into eternity
[1:40:31] by the grace of god
[1:40:36] how many are really conscious of it
[1:40:42] brother it's not just an idea something
[1:40:44] got in your head not but too often and
[1:40:46] it's just it's unfortunate that too many
[1:40:48] so-called believers all they got is in
[1:40:50] their head or they believe oh yeah the
[1:40:52] prophet are theophanies right there
[1:40:56] yeah but um but the bible speaks of
[1:40:58] groaning
[1:41:00] groaning to get out of this dimension
[1:41:01] into that dimension
[1:41:03] and brother the closer we're getting to
[1:41:05] eternity closer we're getting to the
[1:41:06] resurrection closer we're getting to the
[1:41:08] rapture amen

[1:41:27] more conscious of eternity than time

[1:41:33] when we consider what the prophets say
[1:41:35] concerning the number that is going to
[1:41:36] go
[1:41:38] at a time into eternity at the
[1:41:39] resurrection rapture
[1:41:43] i trust we're numbered with the very few
[1:41:48] oh
[1:41:50] it is shocking
[1:41:52] i know because i've shocked certain
[1:41:54] believers when i've said what the
[1:41:55] prophet said about how many will be here
[1:41:59] for the resurrection and the rapture
[1:42:04] oh yeah
[1:42:06] believers have been shocked
[1:42:08] that few is going to be that few

[1:42:18] at the time when that anointing
[1:42:20] and i'll tell you this brother

[1:46:27] he said the token had to be displayed
[1:46:30] he said it's not a sympathizer he said
[1:46:32] with the token but a token must be
[1:46:35] applied
[1:46:38] amen no matter how much anyone he said
[1:46:42] could prove that he was a jew or a
[1:46:44] covenant jew by circumcision that didn't
[1:46:47] do anything about it he said it took the
[1:46:50] token not the covenant
[1:46:53] amen he said he never said when i
[1:46:56] received a covenant sign
[1:46:58] he said but when i see the token
[1:47:01] amen
[1:47:03] so today he said you might be a
[1:47:04] professed christian and he said you
[1:47:07] might be a covenant
[1:47:08] and he said with oh yeah
[1:47:11] with covenant with christ but unless
[1:47:13] that token is displayed in this late
[1:47:16] hour that we are coming to now there is
[1:47:20] no way for him to pass over
[1:47:22] the token must be displayed
[1:47:25] it must
[1:47:27] be in control
[1:47:29] the token
[1:47:32] so he said remember a jew could have
[1:47:34] come up and said i'll take you men aside
[1:47:37] and i believe that to be the truth i
[1:47:39] believe moses the prophet i believe the
[1:47:42] pillar of fire that's guiding him i
[1:47:44] believe that's jehovah witness all of it
[1:47:48] believe all the word all the message but
[1:47:50] yet say now i'm just as well off as you
[1:47:54] because i am a circumcised jew
[1:47:58] and he said if he didn't have that blood
[1:48:00] in the night of the passover he died
[1:48:03] just the same
[1:48:05] and he said today he said every church
[1:48:08] listen
[1:48:10] every church
[1:48:12] every individual that isn't and cannot
[1:48:15] display that token of the holy ghost is
[1:48:18] spiritually
[1:48:19] dying
[1:48:23] and
[1:48:24] will die
[1:48:29] every church every individual that isn't
[1:48:32] and cannot display the token of the holy
[1:48:35] ghost it's spiritually dying and will
[1:48:37] die and no matter how much you believe
[1:48:40] in the death burial and resurrection he
[1:48:42] said no matter how much you can repeat
[1:48:44] the apostles creed
[1:48:46] he said whatever you might do
[1:48:48] repeat it no matter how well how
[1:48:51] educated you are what a theologian you
[1:48:53] experience he said no
[1:48:56] he said there must be the token
[1:48:58] displayed
[1:49:00] amen
[1:49:01] the life it's the life
[1:49:04] not the letter
[1:49:06] no no it's it's the life
[1:49:10] that makes the letter live
[1:49:13] amen
[1:49:16] he said listen i want you to remember
[1:49:19] this
[1:49:20] he said you inside outside in the
[1:49:22] basement wherever you are he said
[1:49:24] wherever you may be the hour has come
[1:49:26] and he said everyone
[1:49:28] can see the dullness of the church today
[1:49:31] everybody can see the deadness of many
[1:49:34] and he said too many of the members it's
[1:49:37] just because that you have played around
[1:49:39] and you took sensations and you took
[1:49:42] other things
[1:49:44] and he said you have trusted upon he
[1:49:46] said the membership of your mother's
[1:49:48] church upon some loyal pastor but he
[1:49:51] said that all our good things have
[1:49:54] nothing against them no more than
[1:49:56] circumcision was to the jew but he said
[1:49:58] that wasn't god's program
[1:50:00] he said when i
[1:50:02] see the blood
[1:50:07] well
[1:50:08] can you see the blood yes by the life of
[1:50:10] the blood in you
[1:50:12] if any he got to see in you it's not
[1:50:15] just the letter of the word it's gonna
[1:50:16] be the life of the word
[1:50:20] amen
[1:50:22] and today said the holy ghost
[1:50:24] is god's covenant
[1:50:26] with god's covenant people
[1:50:28] the holy ghost the life of the
[1:50:31] resurrected christ has got to be
[1:50:33] displayed in the church amongst the
[1:50:36] people
[1:50:36] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:50:41] forever
[1:50:42] amen
[1:50:44] and he said today the exodus is calling
[1:50:46] out of the systems into the bride
[1:50:49] it's no matter how you said how much
[1:50:51] system you're in it still requires the
[1:50:53] token of the life of jesus amen of jesus
[1:50:57] christ again
[1:50:58] nothing else will work
[1:51:00] still the token is required the life of
[1:51:03] jesus
[1:51:04] christ in you
[1:51:11] so the life you live is it is it the
[1:51:14] reflection of jesus in you
[1:51:16] i trust by grace it's not the letter of
[1:51:18] the word but the spirit
[1:51:21] amen
[1:51:23] he said remember
[1:51:25] the holy spirit will only recognize the
[1:51:28] covenant people
[1:51:29] are you in the covenant are you in the
[1:51:31] word
[1:51:32] the holy ghost will only recognize those
[1:51:35] that are hungry and thirsting for the
[1:51:37] word
[1:51:39] amen
[1:51:42] he said we find that death was ready to
[1:51:44] strike egypt at any time and god had
[1:51:46] showed them his grace his power and his
[1:51:49] signs
[1:51:50] and i want you to know that that's
[1:51:52] followed every revival
[1:51:54] grace power and signs
[1:51:57] he's a grace to come to the people power
[1:52:00] to make himself known
[1:52:02] and the sign of the times
[1:52:06] god's revealing it in you and me
[1:52:13] oh brother we're not here just going out
[1:52:15] here just to reflect and and be a
[1:52:17] witness for this church no no it's a
[1:52:20] witness for jesus
[1:52:22] witness for the word is a witness for
[1:52:24] the resurrection a witness for the
[1:52:26] rapture
[1:52:27] what god is doing
[1:52:31] churches for the most part today they're
[1:52:33] there
[1:52:34] representing what god has done
[1:52:37] but how many are representing what god
[1:52:39] is doing
[1:52:43] that's tremendous
[1:52:45] oh yeah there's even message churches
[1:52:47] and they're based on what god did what
[1:52:48] god did
[1:52:50] god did this god did that in in in the
[1:52:53] ministry of william branham in this
[1:52:54] ministry that ministry but what is he
[1:52:56] doing now
[1:53:00] again
[1:53:02] i mentioned it i don't know what was to
[1:53:03] do
[1:53:06] i might have been brother jonathan but
[1:53:08] uh
[1:53:09] or my other brother ed cater i was
[1:53:10] talking on the phone where the prophet
[1:53:12] of god said he said you
[1:53:14] ministers
[1:53:16] you referred to us back then you young
[1:53:18] ministers
[1:53:19] he said you ordained to take this
[1:53:21] message on to the coming of the lord
[1:53:29] not god set a prophet
[1:53:32] but it's not we've already been through
[1:53:33] that
[1:53:35] that's passed
[1:53:38] where are we now after all those years
[1:53:40] since the prophet has been gone
[1:53:44] where are we now what are we doing
[1:53:47] what is god doing
[1:53:50] he said
[1:53:51] you young ministers ordained to take the
[1:53:54] message on to the coming of the lord
[1:53:58] are we doing that
[1:54:01] god help us
[1:54:06] grace amen
[1:54:11] again
[1:54:13] he said listen
[1:54:14] he said you could take that one
[1:54:16] scripture there and run it around and
[1:54:18] around for 10 weeks and never leave it
[1:54:21] and he said i would symbolize three
[1:54:23] stages that we have come through it
[1:54:25] would symbolize the three mercies of god
[1:54:28] and he said through he said it was oh
[1:54:30] yeah he said there was martin luther he
[1:54:32] said and so on to pentecost and he said
[1:54:34] on down wesley each of the three stages
[1:54:37] of the journey
[1:54:39] and he said amen the three stages of
[1:54:41] israel's journey three messengers to
[1:54:43] sodom all these different things
[1:54:46] and he said it would symbolize the
[1:54:48] ministry of today
[1:54:50] it would symbolize the message of billy
[1:54:53] graham grace to the world
[1:54:55] or robert's power to the world
[1:54:58] he said the presence of jesus christ as
[1:55:01] the last sign to the world
[1:55:05] that was billy graham or roberts william
[1:55:08] branham
[1:55:10] he brought that in another message
[1:55:13] he said there has been three witnesses
[1:55:15] to the world
[1:55:17] and he said billy graham oral roberts
[1:55:19] and william branham
[1:55:22] billy graham did this oral roberts did
[1:55:24] this and william branham was doing that
[1:55:30] so he said he said symbolize the message
[1:55:32] of billy graham he said grace to the
[1:55:35] world
[1:55:36] he was preaching the grace of god for
[1:55:38] the salvation of their souls
[1:55:42] oral roberts oh yeah
[1:55:45] he came forth with the signs and wonders
[1:55:46] ministry
[1:55:48] i remember
[1:55:50] because i i can remember back in those
[1:55:52] days
[1:55:54] yeah i lived
[1:55:56] experienced it
[1:55:59] yeah even to even to i lived to see that
[1:56:02] time when when oral roberts was taken
[1:56:03] off the scene
[1:56:06] and wow many were shocked
[1:56:10] when we received the news that oral
[1:56:12] roberts was gone
[1:56:15] god had took him off the scene what
[1:56:17] oral roberts
[1:56:19] why
[1:56:21] because he represented such a powerful
[1:56:23] signs and wonders ministry around the
[1:56:25] world
[1:56:28] yeah
[1:56:29] but william branham yeah he had signs
[1:56:31] and wonders too but you've got to
[1:56:33] understand that
[1:56:34] oral roberts went on and on and on in
[1:56:37] his sons and wonders ministry but when
[1:56:38] it comes to brother branham it was it
[1:56:40] was the he had three he had three pulls
[1:56:44] and he went through the first the second
[1:56:46] and then oh
[1:56:50] and he had to leave as it were oh god
[1:56:52] allowed to do this god allowed him to do
[1:56:54] that one poor he said now he said
[1:56:55] brother brown you got to do this
[1:56:57] first and second paul get the people to
[1:57:00] believe
[1:57:02] believe what
[1:57:03] healing no that was oral roberts
[1:57:06] to believe the word
[1:57:10] because
[1:57:11] the first and second pull signs in one
[1:57:13] nurse amen but the third bull was the
[1:57:16] opening of the word
[1:57:18] now he said brother brown get the people
[1:57:20] to believe god help us
[1:57:24] amen billy graham did what he was
[1:57:26] ordained to do amen or roberts did any
[1:57:29] what he was ordained to do and the
[1:57:31] prophet of god did what he was ordained
[1:57:33] to do
[1:57:36] so he said again billy graham of grace
[1:57:39] to the world
[1:57:41] or roberts the power to the world
[1:57:45] of the presence of jesus christ
[1:57:47] as the last sign to the world
[1:57:50] amen for the
[1:57:52] sodomies of god their last sign the
[1:57:54] church spiritual he said the one that
[1:57:56] was called out got their last sign
[1:57:59] before the gentile world was burned
[1:58:01] and jesus said so shall it be in the
[1:58:04] coming of the son of man he said the
[1:58:06] same thing
[1:58:08] amen
[1:58:10] and he said we find out that these great
[1:58:12] things had been displayed in egypt
[1:58:15] and they were displayed in the world
[1:58:20] god have mercy on us
[1:58:23] brother he said the end
[1:58:27] and just think what's god requiring now
[1:58:30] god's requiring us
[1:58:32] to believe the word
[1:58:34] god and what and not just just don't
[1:58:36] just say oh it's the bible i believe it
[1:58:38] no
[1:58:40] in the word where god is working now
[1:58:44] the resurrection the rapture
[1:58:50] pentecost believed this others believed
[1:58:52] that others believed that but now
[1:58:54] brother has been a calling out of the
[1:58:56] bride to believe for the resurrection
[1:58:58] and rapture
[1:59:03] and brother ram highlighted this in the
[1:59:04] rapture message
[1:59:07] yeah he said the third pole
[1:59:12] the third pole
[1:59:13] we saw that was the only word yes but he
[1:59:15] said the third poll was to bring and
[1:59:18] give us
[1:59:19] rapturing faith
[1:59:23] amen
[1:59:24] go read the rapture message
[1:59:28] he one sign did this once on another
[1:59:30] sign did that but brother want to come
[1:59:32] to the opening of the word amen praise
[1:59:34] the lord it was to give us the faith
[1:59:37] that we need for the rapture
[1:59:42] and he said we see in the church where
[1:59:44] grace has went forth to call them
[1:59:47] and we see he said where the power has
[1:59:49] been demonstrated by the pentecostal
[1:59:51] group and bring back again the baptism
[1:59:54] of the holy ghost and he said we have
[1:59:56] seen the supernatural power of the
[1:59:59] identification of jesus christ himself
[2:00:02] standing in our midst
[2:00:06] he is among us
[2:00:14] he said listen
[2:00:16] the first thing they got to go through
[2:00:19] identify that the howard was at hand a
[2:00:22] prophet with the message
[2:00:25] moses came with a message
[2:00:28] the word of god was with moses the next
[2:00:31] thing he said moses had to be identified
[2:00:34] and he was identified by a pillar of
[2:00:36] fire
[2:00:37] and the same thing that happened today
[2:00:40] the same thing the word of god has been
[2:00:42] brought to us the pillar of fire is
[2:00:45] among us
[2:00:46] identifying jesus christ raised from the
[2:00:49] dead
[2:00:50] the same yesterday today forever and the
[2:00:53] assurance of the baptism of the holy
[2:00:55] ghost amen
[2:00:58] the baptism of the holy ghost upon our
[2:01:00] hearts and putting our love to god the
[2:01:04] all

[2:01:11] for the rise the rapture
[2:01:13] to go out

[2:01:20] bride out of the church
[2:01:22] the exodus for the rapture
[2:01:25] amen are we ready for the rapture
[2:01:31] are we more conscious of the rapture
[2:01:34] not just oh god sent a prophet he had
[2:01:37] signs and wonders what a miraculous
[2:01:39] ministry amen we saw this we saw that
[2:01:42] amen what was what was it for oh just to
[2:01:46] get us to believe and keep going on no
[2:01:48] to get us to believe and going to
[2:01:49] rapture
[2:01:50] going to resurrection
[2:01:53] it's to get us out of here
[2:01:55] because it's the finish it's the end
[2:02:00] amen
[2:02:01] as he had to get the people to believe
[2:02:03] moses and to believe moses ministry in
[2:02:06] egypt
[2:02:07] amen what was the significance of it it
[2:02:10] was to bring him out of egypt
[2:02:12] what's the significance of this ministry
[2:02:14] now the problem of god is bringing it
[2:02:15] out here amen what's the significance of
[2:02:18] it is to get us out of here into the
[2:02:20] rapture
[2:02:27] god's requirement of you
[2:02:33] again he said today is the calling out
[2:02:35] of the bride
[2:02:36] the exodus for the rapture
[2:02:40] god help us
[2:02:43] bear with me oh just a few minutes
[2:02:49] he said there should be such a hunger to
[2:02:51] get to church and he said there should
[2:02:53] be such a hunger for us to get to one
[2:02:55] another
[2:02:58] it should be a love affair
[2:03:05] yeah
[2:03:08] i tell you in the early days you
[2:03:10] consider the revival in the early days
[2:03:12] of luther
[2:03:14] considered the revival of the spirit
[2:03:15] that was on them
[2:03:17] morning noon and night
[2:03:19] and yeah there was a time when even john
[2:03:20] wesley would preach five five times a
[2:03:22] day
[2:03:24] preach
[2:03:25] five times a day
[2:03:27] was time when when brother john wesley
[2:03:29] he would go to church to preach but
[2:03:31] there's the church wasn't big enough to
[2:03:33] keep keep the crowd
[2:03:35] and where where did he preach he
[2:03:37] he preached outside
[2:03:39] and what did he stand on he went and
[2:03:41] stood upon a tombstone
[2:03:44] because for the most part in those days
[2:03:47] graveyards were around around the
[2:03:48] churches and so he just went to the
[2:03:50] cemetery the graveyard and he stood up
[2:03:51] on a high i guess a large tombstone
[2:03:53] there and he preached
[2:03:55] and all and then all the all the
[2:03:57] believers were just standing around
[2:04:00] the church wasn't big enough
[2:04:03] and he preached five times a day
[2:04:09] and went on to
[2:04:10] william booth
[2:04:13] he would preach and preach and preach
[2:04:16] and preach
[2:04:17] yeah
[2:04:19] well we just wouldn't stop
[2:04:21] salvation
[2:04:22] army pentecost
[2:04:25] oh my
[2:04:26] morning noon and night pentecostal
[2:04:28] revival
[2:04:30] and pentecost went around the world
[2:04:33] preaching
[2:04:36] god help us now brother it's come down
[2:04:39] to the bride
[2:04:41] but the thing of it is
[2:04:45] the bride revival is getting much much
[2:04:48] smaller
[2:04:49] god help us
[2:04:55] he said listen
[2:05:00] he said that's the way the church ought
[2:05:02] to be just seeing that power of god and
[2:05:04] he said what it's done for us we should
[2:05:06] be counting the moments and he said
[2:05:08] getting together in love that we can fly
[2:05:12] away someday to meet jesus
[2:05:15] amen
[2:05:16] and it says he will appear the second
[2:05:18] time to all those that love is appearing
[2:05:24] he said who love and are longing for his
[2:05:27] appearing
[2:05:29] now and you're loving it and longing for
[2:05:30] it
[2:05:36] it is a love affair and now we ought to
[2:05:38] love one another because we are fellow
[2:05:40] citizens in the same body and we should
[2:05:43] have loved one for another
[2:05:46] and he said warning us the time is at
[2:05:48] hand
[2:05:49] and believers should be separating
[2:05:51] themselves from the things of the world
[2:05:54] separate themselves from the cares of
[2:05:56] this world
[2:05:57] and he said that's the reason i hammer
[2:05:59] at women and so forth and he said then
[2:06:02] he said separate yourself from tv
[2:06:05] programs separate yourself from this
[2:06:07] hollywood evangelism
[2:06:10] and he said come back to deepness and
[2:06:12] sincerity
[2:06:13] amen
[2:06:15] he said we stand in the pulpit jump up
[2:06:17] and down laugh and holler and carry on
[2:06:20] and women dance over the floors clothes
[2:06:23] on them real skin tight and all kinds of
[2:06:26] jewelry and stuff hanging on and he said
[2:06:28] bug there and some of them with makeup
[2:06:31] on
[2:06:32] and he said they got a oh yeah he said
[2:06:33] they got an intellectual pastor and he
[2:06:36] said they're a preacher that can put the
[2:06:38] word together so perfect but he said
[2:06:40] that isn't it
[2:06:42] he said we don't come to the altar of
[2:06:43] god laughing carrying on and cutting up
[2:06:46] we come to the altar with sincerity and
[2:06:48] deepness
[2:06:49] because there we are dying

[2:09:05] amen
[2:09:07] a woman can come up get up from there
[2:09:09] and go away
[2:09:11] and she wants to obey every scripture
[2:09:14] amen that's in the bible
[2:09:16] regardless of what takes place a man and
[2:09:19] a man the same way
[2:09:20] amen if you really got god in you the
[2:09:23] anointing of god in you amen
[2:09:27] your emphasis is on the word
[2:09:30] you give the word preeminence
[2:09:33] amen
[2:09:36] listen
[2:09:38] he said to come to the altar
[2:09:40] with dry hide confession is a tradition
[2:09:43] he said you should die there to your
[2:09:45] sacrifice
[2:09:47] as you identify yourself that you are
[2:09:49] dead
[2:09:50] amen that you are buried in christ
[2:09:54] amen
[2:09:56] and the world is dead behind you
[2:09:58] amen
[2:10:00] and you're to walk in a new life with
[2:10:02] christ
[2:10:03] amen in his resurrection
[2:10:06] loving his word
[2:10:08] and taking his word
[2:10:10] amen
[2:10:12] so we see that we are living down at the
[2:10:14] last hours
[2:10:16] and the believers must accept all the
[2:10:19] word
[2:10:21] amen
[2:10:23] he said we're not to come together to
[2:10:24] talk about the message
[2:10:26] we are to come together to get in the
[2:10:29] message
[2:10:31] amen
[2:10:35] let's get in the message let's get the
[2:10:37] message in us
[2:10:40] amen and the message is it is christ
[2:10:47] he is the word and we
[2:10:49] we're to get into the word
[2:10:52] he said get beneath it
[2:10:54] he said that's what we're supposed to do
[2:10:59] amen
[2:11:00] we know that as brother brown was
[2:11:02] getting near the end of his ministry
[2:11:04] and this was november 1963 and
[2:11:07] especially after the opening of the
[2:11:08] seals
[2:11:10] brother began to put more and more and
[2:11:12] more emphasis on the life
[2:11:16] of the bride
[2:11:17] separation unto the lord
[2:11:20] put more and more emphasis on the
[2:11:21] resurrection the rapture
[2:11:24] the coming of the lord
[2:11:27] amen
[2:11:28] but more and more episodes
[2:11:30] of the bride
[2:11:32] and what god was requiring of her
[2:11:40] this
[2:11:41] grace
[2:11:43] if the life of jesus christ lives in the
[2:11:45] person
[2:11:46] they become identified with him
[2:11:49] remember it is christ in you not a
[2:11:52] church member
[2:11:53] not a system but a resurrected power
[2:11:57] it's the holy ghost is the token upon
[2:12:00] you that your life says amen to every
[2:12:03] scripture
[2:12:04] and the promise is written in there
[2:12:07] amen
[2:12:09] you are not yourself no more you are
[2:12:11] christ
[2:12:13] and you don't think your thoughts you
[2:12:15] don't think your thoughts
[2:12:18] amen
[2:12:19] it's christ
[2:12:21] the life that was in christ is in you
[2:12:25] amen i trust by grace that it's true
[2:12:29] let's prove it when we go out the door
[2:12:32] let's prove it
[2:12:35] when we wake in the morning
[2:12:39] let's prove it
[2:12:42] through the day morning noon and night
[2:12:47] is jesus in control are we following
[2:12:50] jesus leadership
[2:12:54] are you spiritual not religious
[2:12:56] there's many a believer out there and
[2:12:58] whether they're very religious
[2:13:01] but not spiritual
[2:13:05] as i remember years and years and years
[2:13:07] ago and i was just by just a young man
[2:13:09] then
[2:13:10] and we were
[2:13:14] we're in a church
[2:13:16] having service
[2:13:18] it's amazing
[2:13:21] the church was full
[2:13:23] and i'm sure there might have maybe 300
[2:13:26] or close to maybe to 400 in the church
[2:13:31] but not all of them were believers
[2:13:33] because they had come for another reason
[2:13:35] concerning i think it might have been a
[2:13:37] memorial service or
[2:13:40] for for a brother that had died
[2:13:44] and
[2:13:45] many
[2:13:48] individuals that he worked with and that
[2:13:50] worked with them
[2:13:52] also came to the church service
[2:13:58] it was amazing
[2:14:01] but the anointing was there
[2:14:03] and by grace that the pastor had asked
[2:14:06] me
[2:14:07] to control the service
[2:14:09] when it comes to this
[2:14:11] the song services
[2:14:14] not the ministry of the word but after
[2:14:16] the ministry of the world again
[2:14:18] and so on
[2:14:20] now remember that we did
[2:14:22] make an altar call and for believers to
[2:14:24] come and pray and so on
[2:14:27] and they came up came up came up and i
[2:14:29] remember and i was moving back and forth
[2:14:31] that we were singing and praising the
[2:14:33] lord
[2:14:34] and
[2:14:36] oh
[2:14:37] and there was a
[2:14:38] a couple
[2:14:40] of believers came and they were among
[2:14:42] all the crowd they were stood up and i
[2:14:43] said oh lord
[2:14:47] i said i said
[2:14:50] they don't have the holy spirit lord
[2:14:52] i said they got something wrong with
[2:14:53] them
[2:14:55] i said they don't have the victory
[2:14:58] and they were they were there stood up
[2:15:01] and seemingly worshipping and so on no i
[2:15:03] said lord there's something wrong
[2:15:05] i shall leave him with you
[2:15:08] and
[2:15:10] it wasn't long after that might have
[2:15:12] been a few months or a year or so that i
[2:15:14] discovered that
[2:15:17] both had gone back into the world
[2:15:21] and it surprised everyone
[2:15:23] but it didn't surprise me
[2:15:26] why
[2:15:27] because that because it was a spirit
[2:15:29] that i was discerning
[2:15:30] yeah
[2:15:33] but
[2:15:34] god was in the service
[2:15:36] because like i said there was a lot of
[2:15:38] unbelievers there but they respected us
[2:15:41] and as i said after the service we were
[2:15:43] out and we were greeting everybody and
[2:15:45] and one of those gentlemen came back and
[2:15:47] he said always said excuse me he said
[2:15:49] thank you and i said oh i said you're
[2:15:52] welcome i said glad you came
[2:15:54] i said we
[2:15:55] just wanted to honor that our brother
[2:15:58] always said listen
[2:16:00] he said i just want to let you know
[2:16:02] he said you know i said
[2:16:05] he said this is this was one of the best
[2:16:08] church services he said i ever
[2:16:10] experienced
[2:16:12] i said what
[2:16:13] oh yes he said i thought it was
[2:16:15] wonderful
[2:16:16] he said a wonderful feeling there
[2:16:19] i said yeah i said well thank the lord i
[2:16:21] said give the glory to god. well he said
[2:16:24] thank you he said he said i just want to
[2:16:26] let you know
[2:16:27] he said i've never experienced that
[2:16:28] before
[2:16:30] i said oh i said it's wonderful that's
[2:16:32] encouraging i said we're doing it for
[2:16:34] the glory of god okay sid thank you
[2:16:36] and that person
[2:16:38] was a politician
[2:16:41] that's right
[2:16:42] but he had come just
[2:16:44] just because he knew this person that
[2:16:47] had died and the memorial service were
[2:16:49] having for him
[2:16:51] and they come out of respect for him
[2:16:53] but he said thank you
[2:16:55] praise the lord
[2:16:58] brother
[2:17:01] let's be in the spirit
[2:17:04] by the grace of god
[2:17:06] amen
[2:17:09] listen he said
[2:17:13] he said what we need today is a
[2:17:15] refreshing
[2:17:16] he said we need a baptism of the holy
[2:17:18] spirit back in the church
[2:17:22] not a celebration
[2:17:24] he said what we need is the feeling
[2:17:26] of the holy ghost
[2:17:28] amen
[2:17:31] listen he said
[2:17:32] i am trying to press upon your minds
[2:17:35] friend
[2:17:36] that our has struck
[2:17:39] that something has got to be done
[2:17:41] and we must do something it's either in
[2:17:43] or out
[2:17:44] and he said that's all he said the hours
[2:17:47] come he said where the token must be
[2:17:49] there and he said if this church ever
[2:17:51] expects to remain alive until jesus
[2:17:54] christ comes he said the token will have
[2:17:57] to be there
[2:17:58] we need the token
[2:18:01] the power the anointing of the life of
[2:18:03] the blood of jesus in you
[2:18:07] grace to us
[2:18:09] he said when god has given you the true
[2:18:12] baptism of the holy spirit then the life
[2:18:14] of jesus christ is within you
[2:18:17] and now he said that's true
[2:18:19] every theologian will have to admit that
[2:18:21] and he said to me it's the new birth
[2:18:24] by the grace of god
[2:18:26] amen
[2:18:30] now he said when you want eternal life
[2:18:32] he said you receive a token showing that
[2:18:35] the price has been paid it isn't the
[2:18:37] blood but it's the token of the blood it
[2:18:40] is the life of the blood
[2:18:42] in you
[2:18:44] brother there's many putting the
[2:18:45] emphasis on the life on the blood but
[2:18:48] how many
[2:18:49] have the life of the blood
[2:18:54] grace
[2:18:59] i've had to finish with this
[2:19:02] couple of paragraphs here
[2:19:04] and again the message is called the
[2:19:05] token
[2:19:07] november 1963
[2:19:10] he said you man he said likewise i am
[2:19:13] through with drinking i am through with
[2:19:15] smoking i am through
[2:19:17] with lying
[2:19:19] i am through with jokes
[2:19:21] i am through with jesting
[2:19:23] i am through with all these idol words
[2:19:26] that the bible said
[2:19:28] will give an account for
[2:19:31] i want the seal
[2:19:33] i want the token in my life
[2:19:35] i am laying my hands by faith right now
[2:19:38] upon my sacrifice jesus christ
[2:19:41] i am identifying myself as a dead man
[2:19:45] or a dead woman boy or girl
[2:19:48] i die now with him because he died that
[2:19:52] i can live
[2:19:54] and he said i am accepting my life in
[2:19:57] him and oh lord
[2:19:59] make it known to me tonight that eternal
[2:20:01] life now dwells within me
[2:20:05] and he said think those thoughts believe
[2:20:07] those things let this entire group of
[2:20:10] people standing here he said up and down
[2:20:13] he said around the place let them all
[2:20:16] take that deeply and sincerely
[2:20:19] he said you will see a healing meeting
[2:20:21] that you've never seen before
[2:20:25] and he said when this starts and he said
[2:20:28] what we need now is healing of our soul
[2:20:33] what we need now is a faith
[2:20:35] that's something in us that takes
[2:20:39] a whole of the word
[2:20:41] amen that when you see the word make
[2:20:44] made real just speak the word
[2:20:47] and it'll be so

[2:20:53] and it will be so
