[56:13] amen the book of ephesians chapter 2
[56:16] read a few verses and then i want to get
[56:18] into two other scriptures amen
[56:21] concerning the bride of christ
[56:23] and the real bride of christ amen by the
[56:26] grace of god
[56:28] considering whether and whether or not
[56:29] we are really truly the bride of christ
[56:32] that we have the bright material amen
[56:35] that he's looking for in these last days
[56:37] amen brother is not what he looked for
[56:40] in previous ages but brother what he's
[56:42] looking for today amen do we have the
[56:45] material amen do we have the faith that
[56:48] he wants us to have today amen brother
[56:51] we can go back again through the ages
[56:53] and and brother they they had when it
[56:55] comes to luther and wesley they did they
[56:57] did have a faith but whether or not the
[56:59] faith that the pentecostal said
[57:01] brother and by the grace of god
[57:04] well i tell you this that the brightest
[57:05] god of faith amen that the pentecostals
[57:07] didn't have
[57:08] amen because what does god do down for
[57:11] the ages by the word that he gave down
[57:13] through the ages he was increasing our
[57:15] faith amen because why because he was
[57:18] requiring more of one age than he did of
[57:21] the previous age until finally we get
[57:23] down in the last age and it requires
[57:25] perfect faith
[57:26] amen hallelujah because he justified him
[57:30] he sanctified him he filled them with
[57:32] the holy ghost he gave them the gifts of
[57:33] the spirit amen and they had the faith
[57:36] amen to receive what god was doing and
[57:39] what god had done but now brother in
[57:41] this hour god's requiring amen your
[57:44] chore
[57:44] faith for justification faith for
[57:46] sanctification faith with the gifts of
[57:48] the spirit amen and the baptism of the
[57:51] holy ghost but now he's looking for the
[57:53] faith for the resurrection and the
[57:55] rapture
[57:56] amen hallelujah because brother he was
[57:59] adding the adding to his word as it were
[58:01] increasing our revelation to give us
[58:03] more and more and more and more faith
[58:06] amen wesley had more faith than luther
[58:08] amen the pentecostals had more faith
[58:11] amen than the previous ages what was god
[58:13] doing he had what he promised he said
[58:16] i'm going to restore amen amen brother
[58:18] he knew that down through the dark ages
[58:20] oh yeah it started off with the power
[58:22] the anointing of the holy ghost the
[58:24] gifts of the spirit amen signs wonders
[58:27] healing hallelujah proving that he was
[58:30] alive the resurrection by the great
[58:32] alias by the grace of god amen but he
[58:35] went into a dark ages and we we won't
[58:37] get into
[58:38] what what brought those dark ages but
[58:40] brother there was a dark ages and he
[58:42] went on went on and on and on but god
[58:44] said i'm going to restore
[58:46] amen and he's going to restore the truth
[58:48] hallelujah amen what was the truth was
[58:51] going to give us the the faith that
[58:52] would please god amen amen
[58:55] the truth was going to give us the faith
[58:57] that we need for the hour we're living
[59:00] amen father god restored the truth and
[59:02] he gave luther the faith that he needed
[59:04] wesley the faith that he needed amen and
[59:07] it was that went on into the salvation
[59:08] army amen that's a brother one time a
[59:11] ministering brother some years ago he's
[59:14] gone on to be with the lord now and he
[59:15] said brother brother drill he said
[59:18] what
[59:19] what what position is the salvation army
[59:21] in in god and what god has done and what
[59:24] god is doing brother damn through the
[59:26] ages he said oh he said he said luther
[59:28] had this wesley had this the pentecostal
[59:30] said that but what about the army oh i
[59:33] said the he said did the problem of god
[59:35] say anything i said he did and he always
[59:37] said i didn't know that so he said what
[59:39] did he say and i thought for sure that
[59:41] brother
[59:42] he was at the time he was much older
[59:44] than i was and i thought maybe that he
[59:46] knew what the prophet's saying no he
[59:48] said i don't know
[59:49] amen that's why i said well brother i'll
[59:51] let you know and he said he said brother
[59:54] he said that the
[59:55] wesleyans had organized so quickly amen
[59:59] brother because luther the lutherans
[1:00:00] went on a little went on to three or
[1:00:02] four generations before they organized
[1:00:05] or before them to try to make
[1:00:07] denominations and amen but he said the
[1:00:10] wesleyans he said all the way many
[1:00:11] within within a couple of generations he
[1:00:14] said they began to organize began to
[1:00:16] make denominations amen and god had to
[1:00:19] move on amen amen because brother i said
[1:00:22] because god god is not not making the
[1:00:24] nominations god calls us out of the
[1:00:26] denominations ain't master what for so
[1:00:29] that we're going to believe him that's
[1:00:30] right amen we're not we're not going to
[1:00:32] be limited to to just believe this just
[1:00:34] believe this
[1:00:36] as that church or that denomination no
[1:00:38] no god is going to set us free so we'll
[1:00:40] believe whatever he reveals right over
[1:00:42] he shows us in the word we're going to
[1:00:43] believe it amen and that's what he was
[1:00:46] what he had to do with with the
[1:00:48] wesleyans and the methodist because the
[1:00:50] organizer he said so quickly he said god
[1:00:52] had to raise up william booth he said
[1:00:54] with red hot salvation
[1:00:57] amen and he said to take the message on
[1:01:00] to the pentecostal revival amen and
[1:01:03] that's exactly what they did and because
[1:01:05] they went from from the lutheran to
[1:01:07] wesley to the salvation army and i'll
[1:01:09] tell you this but when william booth and
[1:01:11] his wife they were coming down to the
[1:01:13] end of their their message coming down
[1:01:16] to the end of their call amen oh they
[1:01:19] were they were recognizing oh yes oh yes
[1:01:22] well we're getting we're getting too
[1:01:23] organized we're getting to two to two
[1:01:25] months like a denomination and oh he
[1:01:28] said what we need just think this
[1:01:30] started this and that not even not in
[1:01:31] pentecost but it was the salvation army
[1:01:34] and they were preaching it they said
[1:01:35] what we need is what they had on the day
[1:01:38] of pentecost
[1:01:39] oh they said yeah yes he said we need
[1:01:42] the power we need the anointing of the
[1:01:44] holy ghost they say we need that we need
[1:01:46] god to take control amen and so they
[1:01:49] were pushing the people on to to what
[1:01:51] god was going to do next and that was
[1:01:53] the pentecostal revival amen amen and
[1:01:56] now we're going beyond the pentecostal
[1:01:58] revival to our bread revival by the
[1:02:00] grace of god amen and brother the
[1:02:03] pentecostal oh yes what's what's god
[1:02:06] doing he's increasing our faith
[1:02:08] amen from luther and wesley and on down
[1:02:11] to the salvation army on into the
[1:02:13] pentecost increasing our faith to
[1:02:15] believe god amen they believe god for
[1:02:18] the baptism of the holy ghost they
[1:02:19] believe god for the gifts of the spirit
[1:02:22] amen but brother
[1:02:24] we believe god for that as well
[1:02:27] amen but what else is god requiring of
[1:02:30] us
[1:02:30] amen because when we go beyond that now
[1:02:33] what what is god going to do he's done
[1:02:36] that
[1:02:37] amen they had those revivals they got
[1:02:39] those revelations amen thank god but
[1:02:42] what what's not what's now amen brother

[1:02:53] resurrection and the rapture

[1:02:57] that will give us resurrection and
[1:02:59] rapturing faith amen brother

[1:20:44] shelf and he said they're there if you
[1:20:46] need them
[1:20:47] amen
[1:20:48] well because there was an hour in the

[1:21:44] still no no higher than than
[1:21:45] justification they're no higher than
[1:21:47] sanctification amen and that's why
[1:21:50] they're still back in those
[1:21:51] denominations and others are no higher
[1:21:53] than oh yeah than the baptism of the
[1:21:55] holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit

[1:46:19] he said universally speaking that she
[1:46:21] needs as scouring out
[1:46:25] and there's still
[1:46:26] a lot of believers that need a scouring
[1:46:29] out
[1:46:30] i remember many years ago
[1:46:36] a certain sister called me on the phone
[1:46:39] at that time she was
[1:46:42] an elder
[1:46:44] older sister
[1:46:47] and she might have been maybe almost 80
[1:46:49] years old
[1:46:51] and she said brother
[1:46:54] she said please she said i want you to
[1:46:56] pray for me
[1:46:59] she said
[1:47:01] i ne i feel
[1:47:02] she said that i need a scouring out
[1:47:07] and i was surprised
[1:47:11] considering who the sister was
[1:47:14] i said you
[1:47:16] you really need that sister
[1:47:18] yes she said brother i do
[1:47:20] she said i feel she said the lord's been
[1:47:22] dealing with me
[1:47:24] she said so she said
[1:47:26] it's been heavy
[1:47:27] so she said i felt to call you and ask
[1:47:29] you to pray for me
[1:47:31] i said okay
[1:47:33] and so i had prayer for her
[1:47:36] and i dealt with her
[1:47:38] not long after that
[1:47:42] amen
[1:47:43] when the lord was getting her ready
[1:47:45] to take her home
[1:47:48] yeah
[1:47:50] i had the counselor
[1:47:54] an encourager
[1:47:56] concerning your faith
[1:47:58] or stand for the word of god
[1:48:00] amen
[1:48:02] her faith in the lord jesus christ
[1:48:06] she knew she was going
[1:48:09] to god be the glory
[1:48:13] amen
[1:48:15] so brother sister
[1:48:19] she needed a scouring out
[1:48:21] how many of us feel that we needed a
[1:48:22] scouring out
[1:48:25] yeah
[1:48:27] god judging you by the word tonight
[1:48:29] do you need a scouring out
[1:48:33] amen
[1:48:36] god scholar
[1:48:38] and got her ready
[1:48:40] and again
[1:48:41] even after she was gone
[1:48:43] i'm not sure how long it was but then
[1:48:47] another day i get another call on the
[1:48:49] phone
[1:48:52] and it's a it's a brother
[1:48:56] and he was
[1:48:59] again
[1:49:00] maybe close
[1:49:01] getting close to 80.
[1:49:04] and he said brother please pray for me
[1:49:08] he said i i need
[1:49:10] i need he said the lord's
[1:49:12] help i said brother what's wrong
[1:49:16] oh
[1:49:17] he said i don't know brother but he said
[1:49:19] please that the lord would give me his
[1:49:21] rest and his peace
[1:49:23] in my soul
[1:49:26] oil
[1:49:27] and he had been a
[1:49:30] a christian or
[1:49:33] well i'll be honest
[1:49:35] he was a pastor
[1:49:41] and i prayed for him
[1:49:43] and the lord got him ready
[1:49:45] to take him home
[1:49:47] and again
[1:49:52] i don't know
[1:49:53] maybe five years ago i'm not sure
[1:49:57] another brother called
[1:49:59] i said lord i said what's going on
[1:50:02] why are they calling me
[1:50:05] and that brother was a ministering
[1:50:07] brother
[1:50:08] and he said brother please
[1:50:12] i need
[1:50:13] your prayer
[1:50:15] so he said pray for me
[1:50:18] because he said i feel
[1:50:21] sometimes i feel like i've missed it
[1:50:25] i need you to pray for me
[1:50:27] so i prayed for him but it was three
[1:50:29] months later and the lord took him home
[1:50:34] so brother sister i pray the grace of
[1:50:35] god
[1:50:36] please make our calling an election sure
[1:50:43] don't assume
[1:50:44] everything is all right
[1:50:46] make make sure it's it's all right
[1:50:50] consider that you may have to go today
[1:50:53] yeah
[1:50:55] and then if you're called home today
[1:50:57] that you'll be ready to be part of the
[1:50:58] bride of christ
[1:51:01] it's serious
[1:51:04] and i
[1:51:05] also i've had to deal with other issues
[1:51:07] with people
[1:51:08] of believers
[1:51:12] yeah that the lord was calling
[1:51:16] praying that the lord would encourage
[1:51:18] them
[1:51:19] praying that they would have the faith
[1:51:22] to go home
[1:51:24] to be with jesus
[1:51:26] grace
[1:51:29] brother
[1:51:30] no wonder that jesus said
[1:51:34] that when the son of man comes
[1:51:36] will he find faith
[1:51:38] on the earth
[1:51:41] because all the way down through the
[1:51:42] ages faith decreases not increases
[1:51:46] it decreases amen
[1:51:49] so brother
[1:51:51] praying the grace of god to give us the
[1:51:53] faith
[1:51:54] that he's
[1:51:56] looking for in the bride
[1:52:00] not out there in a church or there's
[1:52:02] going to be there's going to be many
[1:52:03] outside the city
[1:52:05] but when it comes to being the bride
[1:52:07] and in the city there's there's not
[1:52:10] going to be many in these last days
[1:52:12] i believe that most of the bride is
[1:52:14] called most of the bride
[1:52:16] is ready amen
[1:52:18] they're there but in this hour and in
[1:52:20] this age they're getting fewer and fewer
[1:52:23] and
[1:52:28] fewer well
[1:52:30] somebody said to william branham one
[1:52:32] time they said brother
[1:52:34] what would you do if god asked you to go
[1:52:35] and
[1:52:37] pick out the bride or
[1:52:41] out there in the in these today or this
[1:52:43] this this hour this age
[1:52:47] he said sister
[1:52:48] he said i'd be frightened
[1:52:52] he said i might find a dozen
[1:52:56] a dozen
[1:52:59] well that's what he was experiencing
[1:53:01] back there
[1:53:03] so little faith
[1:53:05] brother i pray god
[1:53:08] that we have the faith that pleases god
[1:53:10] dad we have the faith that we need
[1:53:14] that we love him
[1:53:16] we love his word we love one another
[1:53:18] amen
[1:53:20] and i'll tell you this if your bride you
[1:53:22] love one another
[1:53:25] if you love him how can you love him and
[1:53:27] not love your brother and sister
[1:53:30] can
[1:53:32] if you love him and you got his love in
[1:53:33] you
[1:53:35] well consider who he loves
[1:53:37] and you will love them
[1:53:39] by the grace of god
[1:53:44] so he said what's the matter with the
[1:53:46] church today universally speaking she
[1:53:48] needs a scouring out
[1:53:52] she needs a filling up with god's holy
[1:53:54] waters from heaven
[1:53:56] her heart has become a cesspool
[1:53:59] of anything that comes along and she's
[1:54:01] got lovers
[1:54:03] of all kinds
[1:54:04] the bible said she'd have lovers of
[1:54:06] pleasure
[1:54:07] more than lovers of god
[1:54:10] truce breakers
[1:54:11] false accusers
[1:54:13] incontinent despisers of those that are
[1:54:16] right
[1:54:18] brother
[1:54:19] again he said did did you ever notice
[1:54:22] what the real church is supposed to do
[1:54:24] in the old testament when they had the
[1:54:26] sacrifice they killed one bird and put
[1:54:29] the blood
[1:54:30] of one upon another
[1:54:33] the living mate and it flew across the
[1:54:35] earth spreading the blood of the dead
[1:54:38] mate
[1:54:39] when the church becomes the real bride
[1:54:41] of christ he said shall carry the blood
[1:54:43] of jesus christ with her
[1:54:46] and sprinkling it upon the ground and
[1:54:49] calling holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:54:53] her atmosphere or every bit of her will
[1:54:57] every bit of her will be of god
[1:55:00] her whole makeup will be of god
[1:55:03] and you can't expect nothing else
[1:55:07] and he said that's why people come to
[1:55:08] church
[1:55:11] he said not to play cards and play poker
[1:55:14] not to dance in the basement and have
[1:55:16] soup suppers and things like that that's
[1:55:19] for the world
[1:55:20] and he said we'll never be able to
[1:55:22] compare with them and shame on us for
[1:55:25] trying it
[1:55:27] we should preach the holy ghost
[1:55:29] and power
[1:55:31] preach the resurrection of christ
[1:55:34] we've got something they haven't got let
[1:55:36] us live it
[1:55:38] not try to copy after them
[1:55:40] but live what we know is right live in
[1:55:44] christ amen
[1:55:47] god help us that we're going to live our
[1:55:49] lives in jesus name
[1:55:52] that is going to be christ in control of
[1:55:54] you morning noon and night
[1:55:56] god help us
[1:55:59] keep your attitude right your spirit
[1:56:01] right
[1:56:01] your motives and objectives right
[1:56:04] amen
[1:56:08] in the message perfect faith
[1:56:10] he said jesus lived in a world that no
[1:56:13] one knowed about
[1:56:15] he was an odd person
[1:56:17] he lived in a world of perfect faith
[1:56:20] in the perfect god
[1:56:23] and he says if we lived in a perfect
[1:56:26] faith of a christian to what we are we'd
[1:56:29] be a mystic to the world
[1:56:31] oh brother
[1:56:32] is your life causing you to be a mystic
[1:56:35] to family friends or neighbors
[1:56:39] wondering what makes you so odd
[1:56:42] the way you live the way you act what
[1:56:44] you do what you don't do
[1:56:46] amen but yet in it all your spirit is
[1:56:49] right
[1:56:50] your attitude is right they know that
[1:56:53] but still you live a separated life
[1:56:55] onto the lord
[1:56:57] amen
[1:57:00] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:57:03] by faith substance faith he is isolated
[1:57:06] from the entire world
[1:57:09] and becomes a new creature in christ
[1:57:11] there now you're getting into a bright
[1:57:13] material
[1:57:15] you're getting into a rapturing
[1:57:16] condition amen
[1:57:20] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[1:57:22] the world can talk you out of it
[1:57:24] he said you are coming into perfect
[1:57:27] faith
[1:57:28] hallelujah
[1:57:30] yes he was a mystic to them with his
[1:57:33] perfect faith so is it now with those
[1:57:35] who have perfect faith they are a mystic
[1:57:38] to others
[1:57:39] god help us
[1:57:41] he said we are taught to resist the
[1:57:44] devil
[1:57:45] and he will flee from us
[1:57:47] to resist
[1:57:49] what is to resist
[1:57:51] he said it means just to turn him down
[1:57:55] amen
[1:57:56] if he got thoughts turn it down
[1:57:59] feelings turn it down
[1:58:02] stay with the lord
[1:58:03] he said just resist the devil
[1:58:06] he said that is it just walk away from
[1:58:08] him
[1:58:09] because god said a certain thing and no
[1:58:11] matter what he's trying to tell you you
[1:58:13] don't even listen to the devil
[1:58:15] he says your ears are deaf to anything
[1:58:18] else but what the spirit says
[1:58:20] amen
[1:58:22] and he said
[1:58:23] to he that hath an ear
[1:58:25] that listens
[1:58:27] see what the spirit saith unto the
[1:58:29] churches
[1:58:30] the one that's got
[1:58:31] the listening post that catches what the
[1:58:35] spirit says to the churches
[1:58:37] hallelujah brother there are some that
[1:58:40] are too sensitive to what the devil is
[1:58:42] saying and they're getting less and less
[1:58:44] sensitive to what god is saying
[1:58:46] amen god help us to get more and more
[1:58:49] sensitive to what jesus is saying what
[1:58:52] god is saying to us in these last days
[1:58:57] considering what's going on in the world
[1:58:59] brother we better have jesus in control
[1:59:03] amen so he's going to let us know what's
[1:59:05] going on oh we're listening to listen to
[1:59:08] the world listen to what's going on this
[1:59:09] is going on especially with the coven
[1:59:11] issue and so on oh yeah should we do
[1:59:14] this should we do that follow his
[1:59:16] leadership

[1:59:21] by the grace of god
[1:59:24] oh yeah
[1:59:27] and i know all due respect but they're
[1:59:30] believers that want
[1:59:33] there's some believers that they won't
[1:59:34] go out you know and get these uh
[1:59:36] injections isn't it
[1:59:41] and then they get those needles
[1:59:43] they oh no
[1:59:45] that's the devil
[1:59:47] they think that's the devil
[1:59:50] deceiving them
[1:59:51] do this do this well
[1:59:54] they feel that they want to trust the
[1:59:56] lord
[1:59:57] well god heals through medicine
[2:00:00] the prophet god said that he said god he
[2:00:02] was through medicine he said god he was
[2:00:04] through doctors
[2:00:06] yeah
[2:00:07] because there was a certain sister one
[2:00:09] time
[2:00:10] that was came in the line for a prayer
[2:00:13] and he said sister
[2:00:15] and they said you he told her to do this
[2:00:17] this was going to happen he said you're
[2:00:19] going to be on the bus and he said when
[2:00:21] you get off the bus he said you're going
[2:00:22] to meet another lady their sister there
[2:00:25] on the street on the sidewalk
[2:00:28] and she's going to recognize that that
[2:00:30] sister was sick
[2:00:31] and oh she said what's your problem oh
[2:00:34] this is the problem
[2:00:35] and she said she's going to refer you to
[2:00:38] a doctor
[2:00:39] what
[2:00:40] yeah he said she's gonna oh
[2:00:44] dr so-and-so he's he's down in a certain
[2:00:46] area there and they said you you go see
[2:00:48] him and he he'll look after you
[2:00:51] you'll do that don't worry about it
[2:00:55] and that was exactly what she was told
[2:00:57] when she was in the prayer line
[2:00:59] yeah
[2:01:00] and she did it and she did get off the
[2:01:02] bus and that lady was there and that
[2:01:04] lady got her attention when she saw that
[2:01:06] she seemed like she was sick and now oh
[2:01:08] she said you should go see this doctor
[2:01:10] and she went and saw him and she got
[2:01:12] well
[2:01:14] she never had no problem after
[2:01:17] brother we need leadership
[2:01:20] we need spiritual leadership
[2:01:23] of the holy ghost
[2:01:25] amen oh i believe there's time when when
[2:01:27] when your faith is just leave it with
[2:01:29] the lord but yet there's other times
[2:01:31] your faith is you'll lead you this way
[2:01:33] you'll lead to that he might lead you to
[2:01:34] a doctor he might need to do this do
[2:01:36] that brother i pray grace god help us
[2:01:40] god give us holy ghost wisdom
[2:01:42] holy ghost leadership
[2:01:45] oh my
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:47] oh
[2:01:51] he said just walk away from the devil
[2:01:54] he said god said a certain thing and no
[2:01:55] matter what he's trying to tell you you
[2:01:57] don't even listen to to satan
[2:02:00] he said your ears are deaf
[2:02:02] and so on and he said to he that add the
[2:02:04] nearer let him hear what the spirit is
[2:02:06] saying to the churches
[2:02:07] and the one that's got the listening
[2:02:09] post that catches what the spirit says
[2:02:12] to the churches
[2:02:14] amen
[2:02:15] i'm skipping a lot of these things here
[2:02:18] it's to save time
[2:02:23] and he said again
[2:02:30] he said it takes more than a good
[2:02:31] message from the pulpit
[2:02:34] is that it takes your life
[2:02:37] and it takes you to get ready
[2:02:40] amen
[2:02:41] in revelations the 19th chapter
[2:02:43] the bible said that speaking of the
[2:02:45] bride of christ she has made herself
[2:02:48] ready
[2:02:49] amen and you as a member of this bride
[2:02:52] you've got to make yourself ready
[2:02:55] amen line up with the word and the will
[2:02:58] of god with a right spirit and a right
[2:03:00] attitude by the grace of god
[2:03:03] amen
[2:03:07] he said listen
[2:03:11] he should die to your dirty self
[2:03:14] amen praise the lord
[2:03:17] and he said die
[2:03:19] to the sins of the of the flesh
[2:03:22] be borned again and new
[2:03:24] and if you love the world or the things
[2:03:27] of the world the love of god's not even
[2:03:29] in you
[2:03:30] he said that's right
[2:03:32] so listen
[2:03:34] he said say i don't believe in holiness
[2:03:37] no wonder you can't but the bible says
[2:03:39] without it no man shall see god
[2:03:42] because god is holy
[2:03:44] and if god lives in you you are holy too
[2:03:48] amen and tell me you can go out on these
[2:03:52] parties and drink a little sociable
[2:03:55] drink why the pentecostals do that they
[2:03:58] go out on these parties and take them
[2:04:00] women out there and live in these places
[2:04:02] and go down and strip themselves off in
[2:04:04] bathing suits
[2:04:06] and go in swimming before men
[2:04:08] when your husbands he said and your
[2:04:11] brothers
[2:04:13] and sisters
[2:04:15] and so forth and the pentecostal people
[2:04:17] going out in bathing suits and calling
[2:04:20] yourself a member of the bride the bride
[2:04:22] of christ don't do those things
[2:04:26] the bride of christ is separated onto
[2:04:27] the lord
[2:04:29] and she lives for him
[2:04:31] not for herself but you're living for
[2:04:33] jesus
[2:04:35] reflecting jesus
[2:04:36] thought word and deed
[2:04:39] amen
[2:04:42] in the 1960s there was questions on the
[2:04:44] seals would the bride of christ have a
[2:04:47] ministry before the rapture
[2:04:49] and he said that's what's going on right
[2:04:51] now
[2:04:52] it is the message of the hour
[2:04:55] the bride of christ and she consists of
[2:04:57] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[2:05:00] and pastors
[2:05:01] he said that's right that's the bride of
[2:05:03] christ and she got a ministry a great
[2:05:06] ministry
[2:05:07] but it'll be so humble
[2:05:10] by the grace of god
[2:05:12] amen
[2:05:15] did we finish with this quote here
[2:05:21] he said the bride will have to be you
[2:05:22] know the unadulterated word
[2:05:25] not one word missing nowhere
[2:05:29] could you imagine a correct bride
[2:05:31] one breast off and then other ones
[2:05:34] something or some other wrong
[2:05:36] he said that's not going to be the bride
