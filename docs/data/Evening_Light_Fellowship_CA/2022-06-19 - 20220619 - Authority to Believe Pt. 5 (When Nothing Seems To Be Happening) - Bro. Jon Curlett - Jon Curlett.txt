will and your way we pray lord bless your people now we ask in jesus christ's name we ask him amen and god bless you this morning if you turn your scriptures to lamentations number chapter 3. amen lamentations chapter 3. it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning good to have a beautiful sunny day inside and out amen amen thankful for his goodness and grace to us amen want to wish a happy father's day to all the all the fathers here amen it's a you're blessed if you have a good father amen and we all have a good father there's only one good as brother gerald likes to remind us and then we're all sons and daughters of the father amen but even even the world will acknowledge that if you have a father that that stays in the home your chances of success your chances of living a productive life go up by four times four times if you have a good father that's the effect of a good father these days amen so for the fathers that are here and raising the children and the nurture and admonition of the lord i say god bless you this morning and hopefully your children if they don't maybe appreciate it quite so much now they'll appreciate it later when they see the sacrifices you've made and and the stands you've taken and why you've taken those things amen and then certainly appreciative for the baptism this morning and we've got another announcement sister elsa is going to be baptized lord willing next sunday so we're very thankful for that and maybe we'll just make regular trips to the pond amen amen that's what we would want amen if we could do it every week if there was a need every week if there was a hungry soul every week we go there every weekend if we could amen so sister elsa's uh talked with brother joe and and and he's he's determined that she's sincere in this and so we're gonna lord willing baptize her next weekend so if there's any others then by all means then then talk to okay so mary beth will probably be getting baptized in as well so praise the lord for that amen and then god still moves i mean like i said we're a third generation here we're third generation right and that's when the trouble usually starts right but it's not starting here amen god's continuing the work so we're very thankful for that amen amen we're gonna have a lot of people traveling away over the next few months selena and i or next few weeks celina and i leave on tuesday for california we'll be gone for two weeks and we'll come back with blanca and the boys so certainly remember us in prayer but i know brother mark and sister maureen are going brother bob and sister brenda and joe and and priscilla and family so we're going to have a lot of people traveling then not too far after that sorry rebecca's going as well and then not too far after that uh sister lily's headed to to france to set things up and then brother josh will be going away in the the whole family for for the the wedding of the century so uh and we're just trusting god to be with us and give us traveling mercies through all of it amen amen certainly welcome brother gus and sister elise as well in our service this morning amen lamentations three in verse 22 says it is of the lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his pac compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness my faithfulness no his faithfulness amen the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in him the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord amen god bless you this morning you may be seated and then just call me jeremiah this morning amen amen i want to continue this morning on this little series on authority to believe and this is really a carryover from the last service but i want to preach this morning on when nothing seems to be happening amen we've uh just praying about different things over the last while and certainly over the last week and i saw it dropped in my heart of what do we do when we've prayed and we've done our part and we've done everything we can and we've we've confessed and we've believed and we've testified and yet nothing seems to be happening in our lives amen that the things that we've we've prayed about the things that we've expressed the desires that are in our heart they're there and we believe they're of god and yet nothing seems to be happening to them amen and we've spoken so many times of the promises of god and how we're the children of promise and we're the children of prophecy and we're the children of the fulfilled word and all these different things and yet the actual fulfillment of those things in our lives often looks so much different than what we read on the pages amen we have a theory we have an idea a picture in our mind of how these things are going to happen as we we take them when we put them into our lives and yet we find that the reality of the situation rarely matches the theory we have in our minds amen i can see that as a man as a father as a minister many things we think well it's just going to be this and it's going to be straightforward and guess what it's straightforward to god but usually it's a little bit of a crooked path for the believer because they're trying to find their way and there's so much that's going on in our lives amen and there's times where god is beautifully sovereign and he gives us the desire of our heart more or less right when we ask it you know whether you're you're looking for a provision you know talking to brother joe the other day he says you know and i've i prayed and i've confessed to god and two hours later the phone rang and i had all the business i needed to get us through a low point or something like that and god does that sometimes we've seen it in healing my wife you know when she when brother joe adams prayed for her way back many years in dallas and he prayed for her gallbladder trouble and she was just healed immediately and selena was healed of lactose intolerance sometimes god is so sovereign in those things amen but guess what there are other times where god is so sovereign where he makes us wait and the sovereignty of god is no different when he gives it to us immediately than when he makes us wait amen that's the sovereignty of god is that it's his time that really matters the most amen we want it quickly we're we're human it's human to want things quickly and then it's a it's a it's a time of instant gratification that's right right we don't have to wait for anything we have our phones we have communication we have the ability to travel at 100 kilometers an hour or faster if we want everywhere we go everything can be instant we can we can put food in the microwave and two minutes later it goes from frozen to fully prepared and we can eat it you know in these different things but god doesn't work that way and i'm thankful he doesn't because he's doing a bigger work than just giving us what we ask for amen he's giving us what he promised is really what he's working on and so it's not just the promises of god but it's the character of god that he's building into our lives each one that's so it's a well-known quote but i want to use it to set the tone this morning brother bam says and why does god let troubles come sometimes the trouble is the prayer is not being answered it's not just things are difficult but it's that things are dragging out it's that there doesn't seem to be an end in sight he says why does god let troubles come he says god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god so i want to say this morning if you've been facing a lot of troubles then god is in the situation amen god is working in your life as we've heard brother joe adams preached so much on it where he said that if god has allowed something into your life then remember he's allowed it because god has you inside of a fortress and if he opens the door to let the enemy in then he had to do it with purpose because he doesn't open the door to let the enemy in for no reason but he's laying it in and brother brown says he puts bits in its mouth and a bit in a is used in a horse's mouth and it's tied to the reins and the halt or the rains and it goes in the mouth so that when you pull on the reins you pull the head and where the head goes the body will go hey man it's really hard to go straight when your head's turned to the right isn't it so he says he takes trouble and he controls it and then he's got it in his hands he's got it in his control so whatever the situation is god has the reins so if he's allowed it in he's only going to let it go so far like he did in the life of job he said you can touch his wealth but you can't touch him amen and so he took all of his wealth but he didn't touch his body then he said but if you let me touch his body then he'll curse you says all right touch his body but you can't take his life and so he touched his body but he could never take his life why god was in control god limits satan it's amazing that satan thinks he can get anything done when god's got the reigns on him the entire time amen you'd think he'd figure it out by now that he can only go as far as god will let him but brother brahm says he's working in your troubles to what bring you into closer fellowship with god i so love what brother joseph he says god will start a fire and put you in it to have a conversation with you i mean that's a tremendous revelation for the believers that if he takes you into the fire he's there to have a conversation with you amen amen but job's situation is quite different in that god was proving him god said have you have you considered my servant job he was proving to satan the character and the commitment of job to his walk with god amen but so many times with us it's not about our commitment as it is our commitment to the word it's our belief in the word it's the test of our faith really jobs wasn't a test of faith it was a test of did he trust god amen did his situation determine how good of a christian he was right whether the money was in the bank whether he was lying flat on his back sick or whether he was healthy and hail it didn't matter to job his relationship with god stayed the same he says god gives god takes away blessed be the name of the lord amen but i want to just give you some spiritual vitamins this morning some scriptural vitamins just as we start into this this morning to try and try and and again set this tone here proverbs 18 10 says the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe glory amen if you're mrs jesus christ this morning then you have his name as a strong tower psalms 37 says the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied don't leave when things get tight don't leave when things get dry amen because why there's a promise coming at the end of rain amen there's a promise coming at the end that your fruit will be there and that your inheritance will be there and that you'll be able to reap what you've sowed those many years ago psalms 25 says unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul o my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine enemies triumph over me yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed which transgressed thy cause what that those again that go against your will let them be ashamed but don't let me be ashamed lord because i'm seeking your will and i'm trusting that i'm walking in it show me thy ways o lord teach me thy past lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on thee do i wait all the day psalms 119 says uphold me according unto thy word that i may live you've got to ask for life the way his word says you're supposed to live amen he can't uphold you if you won't hold to his word but but in here david says uphold me according to thy word that i may live and let me not be ashamed of my hope hold thou me up and i shall be safe and i will have respect unto thy statutes continually romans 5 paul says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith unto this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only soul but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given to us if you have the holy ghost in your heart you have everything you'll ever need you are signed sealed and delivered and even though it doesn't look like it all the time there is no doubt about the end uh the end goal for you amen amen i wanted to read those scriptures and it's only a handful we could sit here for hours and read of the goodness and promises of god that he guaranteed a place of refuge a place of of a reality with him in the word amen amen but we're all called out people and i believe we're getting ready to go and man i believe we're getting ready to go out of this whole world amen and our hearts want to go amen our hearts want to go but guess what these bodies are sitting here and guess what they like this whole world they like this old flesh they like the way of these things and we're coming to a place where we've got to get that that body that carnal nature so under submission that we would want to go out of here with everything that's in us and that the body and the carnal nature would have no influence on us amen that the holy spirit would just have free reign in our lives in every aspect that when satan comes in and he knocks on the door we don't even answer the door anymore amen that he has no inroads into our life amen that he is so completely sealed out that he's got no avenue into our life amen amen remember we're called to take hold of the promises of god he doesn't give them so that nobody will take him he doesn't give them to hang us out to dry but he gives them to us for a purpose and it's that they would do good in our lives amen the brother brown would say but to me every word every action has to come from this bible it has to be god's word and then i know it's true if god the bible backs it up and says it's true with the promise then it's the truth it's somebody that's found faith that stands there on that word and makes it live again jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever when we see that in the promise of god then we can be perseverant we can really believe and stay there because it's god's promise stay right with it no matter how long it takes it'll bring it out now that tells me that it's not always going to be quick no i can i don't need to hear the prophet say that i know my in my own life it's not always going to be quick in fact the majority of the time it's not going to be quick amen but he says stay right with it no matter how long it takes it'll bring it out and we look at the situation sometimes well nothing's changing and then what we do is we put it back on ourselves and we say well that must mean that i lack faith if nothing's going on then the problem must be with me amen don't jump to that conclusion right off the bat because i guarantee you no matter what you do satan's going to say you're the problem and guess what the issue is not you amen satan wants to think that you're the limiting factor every single time and the simple fact is you are the limiting factor but you're not trusting in yourself you're trusting in the words so why does it matter what you think or do amen god's looking to your faith and not what you can do or what you won't do but he's looking to will they stand on the promise and will they stay there until i bring it into their life amen god does all things well and as we said he's got all things under his control now brother branham we're talking about the idea well maybe i don't have faith and that's why nothing's happening now brother adam had this family reach out to him and i believe it was all the way over in germany they had a flight ready to fly him over their baby died and they called brother brown and they said brother branham we know that you can breeze this baby from the dead so they said will you come over we've got a military flight we've got it chartered ready to bring you over we'll fly over to germany we won't let him do anything to the baby until you come you can lay hands on it raise it from the dead okay listen to this he says him one morning about daylight i got up and the wife went out of the room she went out of the room i just woke up and laying there a little bit directly i heard something come in the room and i looked there was something moving in the room and i jumped up and i said lord what would you have your servant know he said do not rebuke that that's the hand of the lord see so i got her on the phone i said no god has called your baby and so when she come over to us that night left her at the house when i left yesterday she said what was it brother branham my weakness of faith i said you have great faith you prayed for your baby and you and your husband held on to it to god to raise that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and still you love him that's real faith why because god didn't promise to raise us all from the dead when we died but she said i have faith to believe he can do it and he will do it and she goes to the prophet and he goes to god and god says no i'm in it don't call that baby back to life and she says well what was it me was it me he says no you got great faith you prayed and you held on and you still love god even though he's telling you no right now he says anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you've got faith or not amen when things are going great and everything's rolling forward and smoothly and there's no hindrance we all have faith but let the symptoms worsen one time right let the money go even more out of your bank account go into the negative go into your overdraft and then let your child get even further out in the world right let somebody leave the church whatever it might be and you say whoa what's up do i lack faith he says no you've got to make sure you've got faith when things don't look so good not just when they haven't changed but when they've gone backwards right when you've gone backwards stay there stay there he says every son that cometh to god must be chastened and tried of god so remember our trials work patience and patient works hope and so forth so we just hold on to god whether he blesses us or not we are right there believing him anyhow because he promised it amen if he promises we believe and if he never made a promise then we go with whatever his decision is and we're happy with his decision amen noah's how it's tied together faith is often not the limiting factor but rather god's trying to do something in the situation so you got to see that there's often a different purpose or maybe multiple purposes in the trial or tribulation or issue or or health issue family issue whatever it is there's a there's something else going on and you got to be able to step back and say all right i'm going to have patience in the situation i'm going to trust him no matter what because god is moving here and even though i can't see what he's doing i'll stay here amen and brother braham says what the proof of your faith is that you keep believing and praising regardless as if nothing changes or it goes backwards even that's the proof of your faith is that you hold on and you keep believing and your love to god doesn't change even though you don't get what you're looking for right now we remember this story of elisha and the great shunamite woman remember and remember she went to her husband she said this is a man of god and maybe we could build a little room for him to stay in when he comes here and they did it and then elisha comes in he says to his servant you know what can we give them he says well they have everything they need but they don't have a son so he went to the woman he says god's going to give you something she said hey don't don't fool around with me with this i've wanted a son for so long don't just say those things to me and he says thus saith the lord you'll have a son and she has a son and he's a child of promise he's a miracle baby and then he goes out and he's still a young boy and he goes out with his father in the harvest and he gets sun stroke of some sort and he falls over and faints and then they bring him in and he dies the child of promise dies that's a special kind of torture especially for a faithful believer the child of promise is lying dead and then she what they take them and they lay them in on the prophet's bed and she tells her husband she says i'm going to get i'm going to the prophet and he says take her and she tells a servant she says we're going to ride and don't stop for nothing i don't care if anybody stops and wants to talk everybody wonders what's going on don't stop for anything she says don't stop unless i tell you to stop she didn't say stop if i fall off she says don't stop unless i tell you stop we're going until we get to the prophet of god and when we get there we're going to sort this thing out amen and when she comes up then the prophet of god sees her from a distance i want you to catch this and so he sends his servant he says go and check if everything's right she's driving crazy go and make sure everything's all right and she comes up to hazy and gahazie says is all well and she says what it is well the child of promise is laying dead at her house and she says it is well that's faith that's faith it is well though everything seems lost it is well but when she got up to that prophet she got down on his feet and she grabbed on and he says okay something's wrong here her testimony is it as well but her expression says there's a there's a need here and he says god's hidden this from me tell me what's going on she tells him and he says all right and we'll read it here in second kings four he says then said he took a hazel gird up thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her and gahazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore when he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awakened gehazi wasn't a prophet gehesie had no anointing to do that work that was not his place or his position but he obeyed the prophet anyways and nothing happened and when elisha came into the house was coming to the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed and he went in there for and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord now catch the sequence here right because we're talking about when nothing seems to be happening and elisha goes and he prays and then he goes into action verse 34 says and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth his eyes upon his eyes his hands upon his hands and stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child wax warm now listen this is the basic laws of thermodynamics you put something warm on something cold then that thing cold is going to get warmed up so all this boy is doing is warming up with the prophet's presence he's not alive he's death warmed over is all he is right now as he lays on there that man's heat goes into that boy's body and he warms him up but nothing else happens amen he's prayed over the child of promise that is dead and he lays himself on there and nothing happens now watch this then he returned and walked in the house to and fro he spent some time there back and forth what was he doing making sure that he was supposed to do what he was doing checking in with god and then he went in and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes and he called gehazi and said call the shunammite so he called her and when she was coming to him he said take up thy son and she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out listen even prophets don't always get answered on the first try and then he goes there she's a child of promise amen that was not the child of elisha's promise that was thus saith the lord promised that was god speaking through a prophet and that woman believed that if she could get to that man that man would touch god and god would bring him back to life amen but even that prophet in his permit position with his commission did not get an answer on the first try he had to stay there and he had to check up and he had to make sure and then he went and did it again and then that boy came to life that's what it took him and if you read in brother brown's life story there's many times where he's up on the platform and people are healed just like that right and you can hear whether it's the boy that was crippled and he walks off and as soon as he walks off the edge of the platform burban says there he is and the whole place erupts he's got those he had the the the baby with the the blind he had no eyes and they came in it formed in his sockets on the platform just like that the creative spoken word happening right there in front of them but there are times where brother brown stayed up on that platform with one person for two hours straight and nothing happening nothing happening i've got a quote that's about this long where he's talking to his sister and he's showing her so she can see he's got the discernment but he's got the hand there and he's showing her all the bumps in that and he says you know what here and we're going to pray then she says he says are they gone she says no and he says no i know i don't even have to look he says i can feel it's still there then he prays again are they gone no then he prays again and she says well it's the the bumps are gone but the swelling's still there and then the swelling goes away and he says now you're healed he had to go three or four times before that thing left her why he had to be persistent he had to believe that god had called him to do that amen and because he knew god had called them he didn't care whether it took one minute or whether it took one or two hours he was going to stay there until satan's kingdom was shaken amen until god fulfilled his word in his ministry for the people that he had sent him to pray for god had sent him to pray he got a a supernatural commission to go and pray for the people and he in that commission he would stay there until something happened or god told him what was going on that's right amen that's the kind of faith we're talking about amen amen you've got to know that you're called to this you got to know that he's called you to this what was brother branham looking to he was looking to the unseen looking to the unseen he was going into the word and he says though i can't see it yet it's going to come forth because god you commissioned me you called me and you promised me that you would do this what if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer so they had goiters fall off they had tumors fall away they had eyes there they had legs that were shortened increased all these different things why because he stood firm in the commission that god had given him amen brother brown says this very quickly you got faith in god stand pat god will do it amen listen naaman went to the same prophet elisha amen and he asked him to heal him of leprosy now leprosy was what the disease of outcasts because if you had leprosy you were supposed to be out with all the other lepers in a leper colony but naaman was special because he was a captain of the of the army he was a general is really what we call him today and he was somehow allowed he'd managed to make it so that he could stay around in society somewhat but nobody could touch him nobody could be up close to him naaman was an outcast but yet he was a great man a great warrior a man of reputation amongst assyrians but yet he had an issue and he had something that wouldn't allow him to mingle with people it made him an outcast guess what sometimes we have besetting sins sometimes we've got personality traits sometimes we've got habits of ours that make us an outcast right don't just look at name and say well he had leprosy and that's different than me no guess what we have things that we do and say in the ways that we approach people and habits and these different things and guess what it causes people to back up from us right but there's a remedy for that and then there's a place for that amen now what did elisha do with naaman so naaman came up with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the house door of the house of elisha and elisha sent a messenger unto him catch this now he's going to the prophet he's got a note from the king introducing him to the prophet and when he goes to see the prophet the prophet doesn't even see him guess what we don't have the prophet anymore guess what you have brother gerald and myself that's all god has these days he's got a five-fold ministry now amen don't get offended if the if the messenger gives you a message amen it's still god it's still god and guess what sometimes he gives you a message you don't like naaman doesn't like what he's about to get but it was still the message of the prophet amen amen we've got to be able to look past the messenger and say is the message going to have the effect that he's talking about amen but elisha sent a messenger to him saying go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean but naaman was wrath and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord is god strike his hand over the place and recover the leper he was looking for great signs and wonders to happen because what he'd heard of this elisha from the little testimony of the israelite slave girl in his home to the king he knew that something could happen he believed it but he said i thought he was going to come out and do a supernatural work that he would come and just good thus saith the lord name and be healed from your issue and i'd been fine sometimes we're looking to god that way and saying it's going to happen like a lightning bolt and sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't and we've got to be ready for whichever answer he gives us amen amen we sometimes think well i've done my part so he's just going to do his part and that's going to be it it's going to be a done deal again sometimes it is but don't expect that every time i mean god expects us to be able to handle some instruction and just at least a small test of our faith before we get what we're asking for listen to this he says are not habana and farpara the rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage he's like listen seriously dirty little jordan you're gonna ask me to go down there we got better rivers back home we got better ministry back home we got better gifts back home no no no prophet said go washington the one i send you to right go send go jordan's the only one that's gonna work what's jordan death you got to die naaman you got to go around in death you got to die out to yourself neyman now name is just a he's a he's a heathen he's a heathen who knows what happened with naaman after this we don't know but he says you got to go god's way guess what your rivers don't work this is the only river that works and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing would shall not have done it how much rather than when he said to thee wash and be clean sometimes we're so unwilling to do the smallest things that god asks us but we're so willing to go out and try and do something that seems completely impossible amen elisha if elisha said listen ride to the mountains and at the base of the mountain there's going to be a cave and in that cave is a 17-foot giant i want you to kill him and then i want you to take the strawberries that he has growing in his little garden patch in front and bring him back to me and we'll make a paste and rub it on you and then you'll be healed naomi said sign me up i can do that why because naaman's a soldier right he's used to going into battle if he had asked naaman to do something that that worked with name and strengths naaman would have willingly done it why because it would have made naaman look like a hero it would have made naaman look good it would have enhanced his reputation his healing would have enhanced his reputation if he did it and a certain say look if he'd have asked you to do something tough you'd have done it because you're a soldier and you're used to doing tough things but all he's done is asked you to go wash in the river man listen simple obedience will beat bravado every single time we're trying to do it a different way and god just says obey just do what i told you to do my word tells you how to get this do it my way and forget about the rest of it because what we want to turn our testimony into something about us rather than something about god naaman wasn't willing to do that at least not initially amen amen just follow what god says in his word simple results simple way it says then he went then went he down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like under the flesh of a little child and he was clean and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a blessing of thy servant what would name and of god if he dipped once bupkus zero nada nothing twice same result third fourth fifth sixth so many of us will stop at six so close but we won't go all the way what is six six is the number man you know what six is i've done enough i think i've gone far enough lord i think i believed long enough i think i've put myself on a limb far enough i think i've done as much as i need to do lord but he didn't say six he said seven so one through six there's no difference whether you start whether you don't start or whether you go most of the way you go what 84 of the way you're still not there you got to go all the way to seven six is the number of men six means you're so close to healing that you can taste it but you stop short why because you think your efforts what's going to make you whole no you got to go all the way that god says not as far as you think you can go amen effort is not what gets us results obedience gets us results right he had to dip seven times and guess what i imagine he goes down the first time comes up not a single change he's like told you guys nothing's happening do it again naaman down number two comes up no difference and i'm starting to itch do it again naaman three times four times five six times he's getting i guarantee you he is in a rage i told you guys this wouldn't work just once more naaman just do it one more time remember the the the disciples were fishing they fished all night and jesus comes and he says you caught anything no he says cashing it on the other side they said we've done that all day and all night we've got nothing he says but do it and what did peter say at thy word lord there's a difference when god tells you dude you've been doing it all along but then when god tells you to do it guess what that's when you get results and naaman goes down the seventh time and he comes up like a baby now some of us have young babies and the the best skin you'll ever see is on a baby isn't it it is soft it is clean it smells nice most of the time it's the best skin for a man to have the skin of a baby that's a miracle that's not just healing that's a regeneration amen is what we're talking about and that's what you get when you come into the presence of god by obedience is you get a complete regeneration he takes you back to the strength of your youth amen listen brother brown says you get to a place where you don't know what to do and people say he never got healed why there's that's things still there if god placed that in your heart you stand still you just keep on testifying to the glory of god he says keep on what is it you keep on praying until god answers you keep on believing till god fulfills the promise you keep washing in the water of the word until he takes that thing out of your life that you've had clinging on for so long that thing that sets you aside from everyone you keep dipping and dipping and dipping and dipping and dipping until man gets out and god steps in and you'll never be the same again keep dipping keep dipping stay in jordan until you die out and new life comes out and what is it it's regeneration i mean it's not a new you it's a it's not an old you you know remade this is an all-new you you're come out like a baby you're a what a new babe in christ amen you're a new creation amen like you just come out of the womb that's what naaman was like like he just come out of the womb that beautiful fresh skin amen that's what we're talking about and then don't stop when you put in enough effort when you get tired keep going when you get tired keep going and listen you're going to have to do it you got to keep pressing the battle amen and stop when you get the result and don't stop until you got the result amen brother brown says when you when a man takes a word of god no matter how little that faith is but if it won't mix with any unbelief it will bring him out to the light some of us has great faith that'll just perform miracles some has faith just to hold on till it happens but it's genuine faith wants a hold of it and there's nothing going to shake you from it listen you got faith up here praise the lord you've got faith down here praise the lord because both of them will take you to the same end one might take a little longer than the other but it doesn't matter it'll still take you all the way through he says it ain't gonna mix then that person is persistence persistent he has perseverance no matter how many people says the days of miracles has passed he doesn't believe it he holds on because he's met the conditions and sunk that word into a heart of faith that believes it there he stays sometimes faith makes you act ridiculous to the carnal mind but if it's god's word it's got to come to pass be persistent see god make it come to pass you don't make it come to pass you just keep doing what he said in obedience and he brings it to pass he says john expresses expressed his faith in what god had revealed to him therefore faith works is faith testimony when they see you acting like you're healed then they'll know you've got faith that you are healed what does testimony say listen to this now he says testimony is saying i have it now because i have received god's promise it is now working in me what you just said brother jonathan you're healed you've got it bro says faith's testimony is it is now working in me i am making ready for it to happen uh he says see that's what your works does amen listen the first six times naaman was making ready for it to happen that's what he was doing making ready for it to happen and on the seventh time when god stepped in that's when it happened all the rest was just making him ready for it to come to pass amen full obedience to the full word of god entitles us to the token amen and listen the token is the holy spirit but that goes for every single promise in god's word is that full obedience to his word entitles you to whatever he's promised the oh no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it and added to it but what god said about it amen i want to jump over now we're sticking with elijah and elisha but look at what happened after elijah's mount carmel experience he's up on mount carmel he's just prayed god has answered by fire right he's not just consumed the sacrifice he's consumed the rock altar that's a hot fire that consumes the entire rock amen he's just had one of the most supernatural experiences of his life in front of the nation of israel in front of the king he's destroyed the prophets of baal and then now what happens is that he's got to go call for rain because what god took him out remember he says go tell ahab it's going to rain so now he's got a message and his message wasn't go destroy the prophets his message was go tell him it's going to rain but there had to be a work done before the rain could come he had to prove who was god amen and the people stepped forward and they said we'll accept god now and with that happening with that repentance with that recommitment to god now elijah says okay time for some rain we've made the atmosphere right we've cleaned the church out now it's time for the blessings to fall right first kings 18 says and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees now listen god said tell ahab it's going to rain now what is a what does elijah do he goes and he starts praying amen elijah spoke the reign out of existence by the word of god now he's got to speak the reign back into existence by the word of god god's using the same vessel to take it out and put it back in again amen what is it god's inspiration man's voice that's all you're seeing there it's all you're seeing there and he said to his servant now listen now go up look toward the sea and he went up then looked and said there is nothing nothing i just prayed for rain god said to go and say rain's coming i just prayed for rain nothing's happening nothing there and he said go again seven times listen it's not just naaman that gets tested prophet's got to do it seven times as well here if we see now listen i want you to can you imagine what's going on he's saying god you told me it was gonna rain god you told me to say it's gonna rain i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i prayed six times nothing's happening the sky is as blue as it's been for the last three and a half years there isn't a single cloud in the sky every time the serpent comes back not a cloud there buddy nothing's happening nothing's going on there ain't no rain six times and elijah's saying lord you told me you promised you sent me here with a message of rain and it ain't raining what's going on lord what's wrong is my faith off did i do something wrong do i need to repent had nothing to do with it had nothing to do with it what does he say lord i'm speaking the word and nothing's happening i'm your prophet and i'm speaking the word and you're hanging me out to dry do you know how this looks for my ministry lord come on now yeah preach you know how bad you're making me look right now lord but watch this lebron says you've got to first find the will of god now you've got to find the will of god this morning as you're coming to be prayed for you've got to find the will of god whether it's god's will to heal you or not and the next thing you have to do if you're coming to get salvation you got to find out whether it's god's will to save you or not the first thing you have to find out is what god's will is and then if you have really received the seed in your heart then you can be persistent there's nothing going to move you no matter what wisdom man tries to say it's not so and it's not this and that and the other it doesn't move you one iota because you know what the will of god is he spoke it into your heart your faith sets there and it'll hold right on no matter if there's no more than like a grain of mustard seed it'll bring you right out to the place amen have you been there are you there now lord i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and nothing's happening listen god will never hang you out to dry but he comes through in his time not in your time amen what is brother brahm saying here he's looking for somebody that will hold on until the promise comes amen praise the lord wait when you've met his requirement what do i do brother john wait that brings your faith to a showdown if you have met god's requirements or if you have met and god's requirements has been made or met and you have fully considerate and you have done everything that god required you to do then your faith rests right there that he is what you've got to believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently i'd say diligent is at least seven times based on what we're reading you know pray for it seven times diligently fervently he says be certain of god you know he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith did you know that god likes to see how you'll react when you say oh lord i believe you thou are my savior i believe that you are the healer i believe that you are the one who gives the holy spirit and the thing that i'm requiring you are the god who gives that you're going to the one that you believe can give it to you're not going to the bank amen you're not going to your job you're not going to the world you're coming to him and you're saying i believe you're the one that can give me this he says and then when you confess all your sins and promise god what you'll do if he'll let you get well and then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere god can't use that there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you because he only answers by faith then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but real true faith stands there being sure that god is be certain that he is and if god asks this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it faith says that he is and it's certain that it's going to happen your request has to be granted he says oh i hope you don't miss that if you are sure of god god is sure of his work he's only waiting to test you amen what does the scripture say having done all to stand run away sit down turn back go someplace else having done all the stand do what stand stand can't move forward don't go backward stand you've put on the armor of god you've repented everything is under the blood stand and hold that's all just stand and wait stand and wait stand and wait amen hold fast don't back down hold to god's unchanging hand brother brahm says if you're certain you'll wait on him if you're certain that he is you'll be certain that he provides as well amen glory listen to this it says and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up and say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get down that the rain not stop thee not now listen you'd say a little cloud that looks like a fist seriously we've had no rain for three and a half years and we've got a little hand of a cloud rising up out of the sea this is god's answer is that elijah was that elijah's response he says go and tell ahab rain's coming and he better get down off the mountain fast because this blessing will wash him away if he stays up here that tormentor will get washed away if he stays on the place of victory he can't stay here with this kind of rain that's coming he can't hold in the kind of rejuvenation he can't stand in the hallelujahs of the praises that are going to come forth when this rain comes and his servants are not saying elijah it's just a tiny cloud but elijah's seen what eyes of faith amen and he's saying no no no you don't understand we haven't had a cloud for three and a half years when a cloud comes that means that it's all coming now all of heaven's opening up now and though it only looks like a little thing only looks like a little conversation it only looks like a little weight loss it only looks like a little in road it's going to open up into what a glorious rainfall and it's going to saturate this so heavily that we're not even going to be able to stand before it we're going to have to run before the blessings of god that's how much there's going to be there amen tell that tormentor he's running out of time he's got to get down he's got to leave god has proven himself up here and now he's going to run him right off of that mountain amen listen then we know that god has spoken that littlest sign ought to put us into praises and hallelujahs amen why because we're looking for what anything anything that will show us god's movie anything it doesn't matter how small it is a little cloud like a fist coming out of the out of the ocean that's all it took for elijah well i said this is it this is it it's coming church it's coming brother it's coming sister the blessing's coming the healing's coming the rejuvenation's coming the holy ghost is coming whatever it is that he's promised it's coming because even though it's a little cloud god's gonna magnify this into something that you would not believe amen what is it the answer's on the way amen i see the answer that doesn't look like much of an answer it's god's answer it doesn't have to be big because it's god amen it's gonna meet the need listen he said when christ died you know what he did he gave you a checkbook when you become his child and at the bottom of every check it's got jesus name now the only thing you have to do is co-sign this check with him sure you're not afraid he won't keep his word the bank of heaven won't honor it ask the father anything in my name i'll do it oh my he says what a promise could you put your check on name on the check with him tonight by his stripes i was healed i william branham was healed 1900 years ago by his stripes he's got his name signed in his own blood at the bottom of it the father will recognize that you just try it once now i want you to catch this he says don't try it just do it amen what are we talking about simple obedience when you you say how do i put my name on that check brother john full obedience entitles you to the token all you're doing is writing your name and saying what that's for jonathan corlett that's for ellie colombo yes sir that's for leah collins that's for kim coffee that's for vice shaw that's mine that's all you're doing saying this is mine this is mine this is mine anybody can try to take somebody who knows what they're trying to do it that's right he says it isn't a try we don't go at tride if you got faith you don't try you go do it because you know you can amen what you're not going and creating the money you're not putting money in the bank all you're saying is i'm a child of god amen glory you're not trying to be a child of god i am a child of god and as that i get to write my name on the check yes sir so you got to know who you are amen that's all and then you do that you write that name on that check and then one day it shows up in your what bank account it's that simple it's that simple supreme confidence in the one who made the promise is what gives you that faith amen what did he say you've got to know that he is and he's rewarded them to diligently seek him and guess what who diligently seeks him believers right his children seek him that's the only one seek him the rest of him only seek him for what his handouts but we seek him with all of our heart and soul and mind amen listen elijah is up here and he's praying for rain why because he was commissioned and he was authorized and on that basis he could expect rain to come didn't matter if it took one try or it took seven tries seven tries is what it took but he stayed there until he got the results why because god said you got to bring rain you got to bring a message of rain so that you stay there until the rain comes and then as soon as he saw that he said let him know it's coming amen brother brown says i think it's come to a time that when we've got to know how we stand how can you do anything unless you got faith in what you're doing you've got to have faith and that's my purpose of doing this with the church here is to give the believers faith and confidence in what they're standing for because it is the word of the lord then as long as through the scriptures it's sovereignly placed from genesis into revelation back and forth and up and down not a way for the devil to move in there anywhere then you got perfect confidence see you know where you're standing don't be a one scripture christian that's what he's saying right that's how you get into all these isms and ideas and messed up things amen it's one scripture he says pull it from genesis to revelation if you can do that you're good to go trust god and believe it amen i love that about elijah though that he gets down and he prays and he prays and he prays but what as soon as he saw that single cloud he didn't have to pray anymore glory he didn't say it's small lord make it bigger lord we need a bigger cloud lord he said that's the answer we got to get out of here because it'll wash us off the mountain too if we stick around listen it says and it came this is what a little cloud when god does a little cloud this is what it turns into and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain that went from a little cloud like a fist to black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab road and went to jezreel now watch this and the hand of the lord was on a lodge and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of israel under the blessings and anointing of god aham outran the fastest horses and chariots in the country amen amen oh man when you got a message brother jail when you got a message sometimes you feel like you can run you can run through a troop and leap over a wall-e man but listen when you see the answer coming you can run through anything you can beat the fastest cars you can beat the fastest chariots you can outrun them all why because the answer's on the way amen and i'm going to what let them know it's coming amen this is my message this is my testimony i'm letting them know it's coming today i'll outrun the king on this one isaiah 52 7 says what how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings question is who's bringing the good tidings the one that's in prayer amen the one that's looking you're the one that's got to carry that this isn't just the ministry it's generally talking about that but listen your testimony will run before the answer is even here you see it come you say here it comes get ready boys get ready brothers and sisters the answer is on the way what are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publishes peace peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publishes salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth you've got to believe that he is and then what you go out and you say our god reigns our god reigns he's coming oh i wish i could preach oh man those feet when they're bringing good tidings they'll outrun every tormentor every devil every demon every sickness everything that's dragging you down all of a sudden what you got wings on your feet when you see the answer come and when you believe it with all your heart and by eyes of faith you see it it will outrun and it'll tell that tormentor your time's up your time is up you've got to go amen says and when your faith is put to a test then don't fail stay right with what you believe faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is no things to be brought there's nothing there brother john i got nothing to work with i got nothing praise the lord that means it's supernatural elijah didn't create a cloud elijah prayed until god made a cloud and then god turned it into what something that would drown away everything that had harmed them in the past what is it it's not what you bring it's not what you bring it has nothing to do with it faith creates faith creates if your attitude can create an atmosphere then your word under that can create something that doesn't exist right now amen that you can bring into existence something that was not there before faith brings things when there is no things to be brought faith creates faith takes doubt away now watch this takes negative and makes positive they tell you this myth you know if you work out you can turn fat into muscle that's not true you don't convert fat into muscle what you do is you burn up fat and you generate muscle but you don't turn fat into muscle there is no process that turns fat magically into muscle hopefully nobody's on that one right it doesn't happen but less than what he says it says faith takes negative and makes positive faith takes fat and turns it into muscle is what he's saying it'll take what can't be done and turn it into what needs to be done that's what we're talking about here he says how beautiful faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens where in a person's heart when faith is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart but it can't be based on say well go touch a tree and you'll get well or pray to the post right don't set up your little thing don't set up your little ism your little religion he says it's got to have a foundation and where is that the word of god now there are times where we believe and nothing happens and guess what nothing ever will and that's the sovereignty of god right because why we're in a fallen condition we're in a fallen world we're not guaranteed everything listen we had sister laura collins how many people around the world were praying for lord collins and guess what she still died is that because we didn't have faith i don't believe that for a second but it was what god's sovereign choice to take her right and we've got to be okay with that amen but god will usually give you an answer on those things he'll let you know and you'll see later why he did it yeah but paul had this if you remember paul had an issue he had a thorn in his flesh if you remember and we're gonna read the scripture because i want to i want to address this type of situation because i want to say that that exception that is the exception not the rule we should be expecting and believing for the promises not that they're not for us right he doesn't give us promises so that most of us are the exception to the promise that that doesn't make any sense he gives us the promise because it's for most of us it's for all of us unless he tells us otherwise but listen to this in second corinthians paul said unless i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buff at me lest i should be exalted above measure so paul is saying there that he was not healed or delivered why to keep him humble that's the only reason was to keep him humble god left it there to keep paul from getting prideful and paul admits it he says for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me so he prayed three times four he asked and asked until he got an answer listen no answer is not an answer that's not it you say well i prayed and prayed and i don't have an answer therefore it must not be for me that's not what that's not the example we see in the scripture the answer is you pray until he tells you and if he doesn't tell you then the promise is on the way until he tells you otherwise right okay and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness i've been listening to perfect strength and perfect weakness but i want you to catch this shift in thinking now so watch paul's response to all of this most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities and persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i then am i strong so can i say this if it's in your situ if this is in your situation then this is your attitude if this is what god's doing in your life then this is the attitude you're going to have towards it paul says i glory in my infirmities i take pleasure in my shortcomings that what even despite those things god is able to use me paul never used it as an excuse to not fulfill his ministry or purpose and we don't know what it was there's things that people that say well it was his eyesight there was people that said he had a besetting sin we don't know we don't know for certain what it is but all we know is that paul never let it stop him from being what called god had called him to be he says rather i will glory that despite my weakness despite my condition despite what i'm dealing with all the time he still uses me he still loves me he still meets my need he still calls me and he still uses me effectively in his kingdom that's the mindset of a believer in this situation is that they glory in it look at fanny crosby you talk about somebody that gloried in their infirmity completely blind and she wrote some of the most amazing hymns on the planet completely blind i guarantee you she wouldn't have done that if she'd gotten her healing she'd probably wrote in a whole new hymn but god left her there so that what she could do what bring praise and worship and glory to him but i'm sure god let her know as well this is the attitude that we're looking for right what your your your weakness your shortcoming turns into your testimony he says this is my testimony is that even though i have this issue he's still working through me he's a prophet of the age and he's got a weakness in his flesh whatever it is his testimony is what that through it all what the power of christ may rest upon me amen that's what brought him to that place was that the power of christ brought him through it got him over it allowed him to work through it whatever that case was and it never slowed paul down it never made him ineffective amen amen we're in a sinful body in the sinful world and that stain can never be removed that's why we need a new body right but our soul is sealed but there's going to be a battle all the way to the rapture between those two things amen and sometimes god leaves something in this carnal flesh to hold us back a bit to keep us from getting too proud right what to get us to realize that this is still his working in our life that all the victory sometimes the victory is that you can have the victory even when you're fighting all the time that's sometimes the victory is that you never let it get you right that it never overcomes you but it keeps you going back to the cross to the cross to the cross every single time brother brown would say sometimes god asks you to do things that's ridiculous to your own human thinking remember man does not know god by his head he knows him by his heart in the garden of eden a man was divided between god and satan satan took his head god took his heart with his intellectuals he tries to reason things out but by faith in his heart through god will make him believe things that reason won't even vindicate for it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen see he's got to believe god's word oh brother if you could just get that down good and sunk in your heart it'd make every devil jump and leave right now see he says to know it does it you've got to know he's there now what i'm speaking of this is 31 years in the ministry for me and i've never sincerely all in my life ever asked god anything with this bible open unless he gave it to me or told me why he couldn't do it he says god's always giving me an answer if it ain't happening and it's because of me or because of a bigger purpose he lets me know but he says otherwise every single promise in the book he's fulfilled it every time eventually he says that's right because there's sometimes he can't give it to me because i think i want it and he knows better but he always come and told me why and so i know that's true so god keeps his word you can just depend on it and when i want to close with just a couple scriptures and quotes here just as a bit of a note of encouragement like i said i'm going to be headed away for two weeks of vacation you don't want to stop on a down note you want to you wanna make sure you go away with a good one so let's read james five here and it says behold we count them happy which endure so in other words he's saying we see that people that hold on and endure they're glad they're glad they did it they're glad they stuck it out they're glad that they pressed on they're glad that they held on all the way to the finish he says why you have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy now we look at pitiful today and we say well somebody's pitiful somebody's pitiful well they just you know they're ugly they have no iq they don't have a great job their spouse is ugly you know whatever pitiful they're in a pitiful situation right they don't have their health their whatever pitiful that's not what god's talk that it's talking about pitiful means full of pity as in full of pity for what us that he's looking out for us that he's he's trying to bring us to a better place amen he's full of pity for our what fallen condition and he's what of a tender mercy but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yay be yay and your yay binet your navy nay so if you said yes stay yes and if you said no stay no don't go back and forth it is for me it isn't for me it is for me it isn't for me i believe it i don't believe it it's all on god it's all on me no no he says once you've done it commit it to him and if you don't then don't but don't go back and forth you're not going to get anywhere with that lest you fall into what condemnation is there any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him sing songs psalms is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much that means it's very effective it gets things done brother braham says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much oh if you only knew that in your hand christ gave us the authority with his name by being christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes everything and we find out in james 5 15 that the bible said the effectual fervent he says that's desperation effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much when a righteous man a good man gets in travail he says or soul travail that's right oh this is not just uh i'm gonna i'm gonna get down on my knees and pray for brother ellie this is getting into it for brother ellie amen this is getting down there and saying lord bless him get into his life get into a situation lord that thing he told me lord work in his life we're holding him up before you god grant him grace and what we're going in and we're really praying for brother ellie or whoever it is i'm just picking on him because he's on the front porch on the on the front seat and he's smiling and saying amen so i know he's got a good attitude amen what is he saying get in there get desperate amen get desperate for your brother get desperate for your sister he says when a soul gets in desperation and travailing an effectual fervent prayer of a man that can show the token it does something you got to have something to go to him with what is it here's a checkbook lord only people with the token get the checkbook here's my checkbook i'm filling it out for my brother or sister this morning see notice what the bible says here in james 5 16 said confessing our faults oh brother i'm desperate have you confessed your faults making ready for it he says confessing our faults one to another he says having no faults people asked to pray for you confessing our faults one to another and praying one for the other there you are with love that i got confidence i can confess to you my wrong and you can confess to me you're wrong and i love you well enough that i'll pray for you and you pray for me and we'll stay with it with a factual fervent prayer until it's answered that's desperation that's what we should have all the time amen god bless you let's stand together if you would when somebody asks us to pray this is the kind of prayer we want you know what that takes you know he talked there about love and confessing faults one to another we see these big needs sometimes and they come through and we can pray we can pray for those people but you know who you can really pray for these people right here because guess what i know paul and i know joe and i know sister maureen and brother mark and sister brenda and brother bob and all the way back down i know you i know your lives i know your families i know your situations i know you and i can get in and pray for somebody that i know sometimes great needs come across and you bow your head and you say lord grant grace but we don't know anything about that person we don't know what god's doing what he might be trying to do we don't have a clue but if i got to pray for brother bob then i know what's going on in brother bob's life right i know what's going on in brother ellie's life i know what's going on brother josh's i know what's going on brother joe's and brother chads and these different ones i know what's going on so i can get in there and i can pray for them because what i trust them and they trust me that what as we confess our faults one to another as we say brother i got a weakness oh sister would you pray for me i'm really struggling with this and and my husband this and that and what we can trust that that person is not going to go tell it to somebody they're going to go take it before god and say god they trusted me enough they love me enough to share with me their need and i'm going to take them before your throne and i'm going to pray and i'm going to pray and they'll be on my prayer list until you answer that prayer and i'm going to stay there in desperation i'm going to get into your presence i'm going to fight into your presence guess what desperate people don't stop with the knock they don't stop with the knock because what he says knock and it'll be opened seek and you will find amen you can't be seeking it's funny you tell jensen jensen go find your shoes and what does he do he walks into where the shoes are supposed to be says they're not there and says i can't find them that's not seeking your shoes is it seeking your shoes as you go from room to room to room upstairs downstairs outside wherever it is and you seek until you do what you find those shoes now if he had a desperation to find those shoes as in you're getting a spanking if you don't find those 80 shoes that we just bought you last week he'd look a lot tighter wouldn't he he'd look into every nook and cranny he'd search every room until he found those shoes but if he thinks that it's just a casual jensen finds your shoes he won't go looking do we go and say lord help brother chad help his shoulders lord now i lay me down to sleep there's no desperation there is there brother chad there's no desperation there but i say lord brother chad he needs his shoulders to work well brother chad needs his back to be better so he can drive day in and day out so he can get up in the morning i had my back bad for one day brother chad and it gave me an appreciation for what he deals with every single day that was horrible absolutely horrible guess what i'll pray for brother chad differently from now on because what i can't imagine if every morning i had to deal with what he has to deal with every single day what is it we get into a desperation and that comes with what experiencing them being a part of them being a part of a body loving rubbing the rough burrs off of each other from time to time amen it'll get us into desperation because what i care about you and i know you care about me that's why i'm taking you before that throne of grace amen what is it the effectual fervent prayer of a believer it has an effect amen i believe we ought to be seeing effects and this is not a time where we just are casual about this amen it's going home time amen it's time to get out of here we got to get desperate about it not just about our bodies but about our walk with god about our sincerity amen about our sanctification in our lives about our children getting baptized getting the holy ghost them and we need the last one in so that the rest of us can go amen we ought to be out there looking for what desperate for the souls that need to come in so we can get out of here amen amen god's grace to us amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord having done all the stand lord may you pour in your holy spirit lord raise up a standard and help us to stand confessing your word lord not just confessing your word but confessing our shortcomings heavenly father lord and in doing so lord that prayer it closes up the gaps in the holes in the armor heavenly father it allows you to move on the scene lord it keeps
