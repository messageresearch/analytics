indeed praise the lord hallelujah it's all the grace of god amen praise the lord it's the love of god so we thank god for his love amen because it projects grace amen we think oh it's we get those signs sometimes in in in different homes and well that's fine and it says oh there's this it it is you know uh what is it hope love and grace and so on well i said lord that's not right i said it all begins with love not knowing him with it it ends it begins with it divine love projects grace amen and grace brother brings the faith that pleases god so i pray that god help us brother that we're going to be in the revelation we're going to recognize amen god's plan god's purpose god's pattern amen brother we're not by the but in this end time in these last days now we're not going to get caught up with what man has been teaching for years but rather in the last days god has given us the revelation amen god has given us the understanding praise the lord of his plan of his purpose and his pattern hallelujah so brother we thank god brother in these last days brother he had it in the beginning and he had it in the end the alpha the omega alleluia but in between we know that they got a little bit confused and they had to take this away take that away add that and but god let it go on for a while because he knew in the last days it was going to be all revealed again amen brother the word that was in the beginning is going to be the word and the end hallelujah the word of creation amen in the beginning the natural creation the physical creation brother call comes in now the fit spiritual amen to it comes from physical to spiritual spiritual going back to physical amen new heaven and a new earth by the grace of god oh thank god brother by the grace of god thank god for the victory that he's given us amen brother all down through the ages is seed brother he's been there to help them amen he's been there to give them what they needed to overcome the enemy amen by the grace of god so and rather now in these last days he's been here with the church to give us the revelation of what he's done and what he's doing and what he will do amen so brother and yet even around the the message there's too many caught up with what god did amen oh he set a prophet oh and he did this and he did this he did that yeah what's he doing now amen that was to get our attention to what he's doing amen amen and to focus on what he will do what is it brother's getting us to look up praise all down through the word of god brother god did this to get man to look up he get that oh yeah it's even even in the old testament under the prophets he did this he did that but we find out that this disbeliever that believer this seed of god that seed of god was looking up why because looking up to the lord amen oh yeah that was the result and the end result of the prophetic ministry amen to give them that faith to trust god that faith to believe god that faith to love god amen and brother yes the only change it is it just goes from jew to gentile amen praise the lord the alpha brain to the omega amen brother we got a revelation of the alpha oh yeah that was god yes but what about the omega because it's the same god revealing himself amen it's the same god he caught he was with him then he's with us now praise the lord hallelujah because he said i'll never leave you and never forsake you amen he kept that promise to israel he's keeping that promise to israel and he's kept that promise for his bride gentile bride and he's keeping it now oh yeah he was there brother when he went he just moved off on the on the day of pentecost there and he went out and preached it to this preacher that the gentiles amen praise the lord and he said he still never left them amen right on down through he had that gentile seed many are called amen not saying all the calls are lost but the truth chosen is the right or let's let's get the right revelation brother god and just thank god you know sometimes brother with certain revelation we think god god got an awful attitude we think god got an awful spirit now for this no brother is not amen so we pray the grace of god we're going to have the right revelation of god amen because brother what he is and how he is that's the way the brightest amen this amen the spirit that he reveals and manifests amen that's the spirit the bride is going to have amen oh yeah you got to have a right spirit and the right attitude and brother it's a revelation that the god that he had to even exhort the prophet concerning it amen oh yes keep your attitude right keep your spirit right and again what was it again he was he was condemning this this sister that sister this baby brother that brother and angel don't you do that he said that some of them are my children amen because over the years i've seen so-called believers condemn everybody outside the message don't do that amen because the blood they call you the message is that it's for the bride amen but brother still as i said they are the ones who are going to live in the city what about the ones outside the city amen as the power of god warned us he said you're going to be surprised he said who made it amen you'll be surprised you didn't make it oh yeah is that right oh yes i believe that amen we're getting down to really true believers amen the brother is coming to that place and our faith is being absolutely tested absolutely oh well we believe the message brother it's going to come down to a greater test of your faith than that do you believe god when it comes to saying believe the message but i'll tell you this what what what will happen and what's going on it's going to challenge your faith in god do you believe god oh lord if you you really exist this this wouldn't be like this this would oh yes it will amen see that doesn't prove god's wrong that proves the devil amen that shows you there's a devil that he's warned us about amen so brother they had to deal with him in in eternity oh yeah yeah before before the the creation in genesis 1 1. amen still dealing with the devil he said you walked up and down in the coast of fire they say amen human even in eden he said the garden of god and so on amen oh brother sister giving us the revelation beyond our guard stay with the truth stay with the word amen the whole truth nothing but the truth the grace of god be with us and if there's ever an hour we need to get into that position it's these last days amen because brother as a as abel needed it we needed he needed the faith he he needed the revelation we need the faith we need the revelation amen praise the lord to move on amen because the bible says he had to he had he had a tremendous faith amen and the more he had the most excellent sacrifice oh praise the name of the lord oh will i do this and i do that no brother sister it's doing what god wants you to do it's believing what god wants you to believe amen is going out there and live the life that god wants you to live amen not religious spiritual by the grace of almighty god amen so god help us brother that we're going to have the faith that pleases god where it says that by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain amen and brother we think the person is oh they didn't offer much of a sacrifice well it could be the more excellent one amen be careful make sure you're going to line it up with the word judge it by the word of god amen keep your spirit right your attitude right okay but cain this spirit wasn't right his attitude wasn't right amen he was judging oh my just think he was able look at the sacrifice you meet you sheep blood look at the mess you've made and you killed an animal you went up and killed that sheep or killed that lamb amen right but he hates but it is his faith was based on the revelation that god had given him in his heart just think he didn't write no preachers there as i said god was the god god was an evangelist the devil was an evangelist that's right because the devil come and challenged what god said he said yea as god said huh what but he added to it brother no matter what god does no matter what god says the enemy is there to challenge you oh yeah he's not going to deny what god has said he's not going to deny what god has done amen amen he knows that god is certified of himself it's fervent that it's god in the beginning was the word there were with god the word was god the word was made flesh amen and in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth oh brother let's praise the lord that's basic simple faith by the grace of god amen but the devil is there to challenge it and say yeah yep yep yep but he wants to add his butts whether the butt says again we so thankful we won't forget brother folks amen then when he ministered here years ago amen he said the butts are for the goats he said the goat's butt amen oh brother sister grace to us and you know what the you know what did the goats are they related to the to the sheep they put the goats in there to lead the sheep into the into the sacrifice to be killed they do oh yeah the goats will walk on up walk on up and then when they get to the end they move move off but the sheep keep on going oh yeah and lay down their lives amen so brother let's make sure we're following sheep not following goats make sure we got a sheep like nature amen and spirit not a goat amen by the grace of almighty god praise the lord again by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain amen well we got to offer the right sacrifice we have oh yes most definitely regardless of the hour you're living the day you live the age you live you've got to offer the right sacrifice why because by he by which he obtained witness amen that he was righteous amen do we have that righteousness that god saw in in abel amen what is it the revelation of the will of god the revelation of the word of god amen the truth amen by the grace of god and it says god he said testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh amen he goes on and on and on amen because as he walked by faith now god's expecting us to go by the same faith amen amen brother god reveal it to it to abel now brother a reveal to this one through this one did i want now in these last days he's revealing the word to us amen but abel stayed with the word he didn't go and consult cain and what do you think of this what do you think this doesn't sound right no yes it was right to him in his heart because in your seed you respond to the word if you're saved you'll recognize the word if you're saved you know that it's god oh yeah there there's many a person that because they are not seed and they'll think oh concerning what william branham said he said that oh yeah he said that oh he shouldn't have said that oh yes he said it because god wanted him saying he said it to get the attention of the bride the bride would recognize the word as abel did we do as he stayed with the word we say with the word amen regardless of the price that we're going to have to pay and brother we get we're now you know i trust you know i don't know if you thought stopped to think about it concerning the world we're living in amen concerning covenant 19 and all that's going on brother sister all that's been going on for the last two years has been absolutely insane it is i tell you no no don't and it's not just canada it's not just here and there somewhere else no no it's all over the world amen this spirit is gone completely around the world brother sister don't don't stop to consider and think oh well i don't think this is going to happen all over the world all over the world it it it will happen and it is happening oh yeah i mean say if you're going to just worship the antichrist yes they're going to worship the antichrist all over the world all the world because they recognize this going on this is going on that's going on brother when the antichrist steps steps up and and takes and exercises authority or they'll believe it that's brother this is the absolutely crazy insane world we live in and i tell you it's insane it is absolutely insane brother and our the only sanity we got i'll tell you is the word is the message stay with the message brother if you're if you stay with the message you you'll stay with the sanity will stay with you you'll you'll be saying if not you'll be running here running there doing this doing that oh oh my justifying this trying to justify that amen brother i pray god's grace we're going to stay with the word amen we're going to believe the word hallelujah no matter no matter how crazy the world is going to get we're going to stay with the word and no matter how crazy we are in the eyes of the world we will stay with the word amen and young and old i pray god give us that grace to stay believing the truth amen no matter what the challenge and we know right now concerning the rules and regulations concerning covenant 19 it's it's always affecting our our worship it's affecting you know our get fellowship and getting together oh yeah it is you know but again it's because of this going on that's going on but we but the thing of it is we have to take our stand when they are challenging our faith they take our stand when they're they're doing something to just to stop us because of what we believe that's that's the thing and this is not concerning what we believe right now indirectly yes but not directly amen but i'll tell you this as we get closer and closer to the end the challenge is going to be because of what we believe it's going to be challenge are you going to stay still stay with the word now you can still stay with the revelation amen listen will i have to to stay with the truth exactly like that yes why because brother the truth that god has given us and the truth that god has asked us to believe is ordained to give us the resurrection and rapturing faith amen by the grace of almighty god and in the eyes of the world they won't think we need it well we don't need to do believe this and believe it that way and believe it that way all we got to do is believe in god well more than that because that's what the devil believes he believes in god oh yeah sure he does and he knows he knows the word of god he says yeah as god said yeah as god said yes god said amen oh yeah he can say thus saith the lord thus saith the lord but that's what he told eve to say the lord but let me do this but i say unto you you know and all he did was change one word god help us brother there's too many believers now changing this changing that why because they want they want oh yes they want to go on living oh we're going to be wonderful i believe the message and i believe you know god is real this is the word and i believe the word i've been baptized in in the name of the lord jesus christ well i believe there's a lot of devils baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen but they're not going on with they're not staying with the word they're not continuing in the truth if you continue in my word then amen don't head to it don't take it from it stay with the world god help us brother because and and i believe that our faith is is really being challenged amen he wants to head a little here add a little there or this get this mode of an objective this mode of an objective amen oh yeah trying to get trying to think get us to persuade us that oh we're justified in doing this in doing that no sir because the only way we're justified stay with the truth amen it is he god that justifies us amen amen sorry the lord bless you amen we preached we'll continue on amen and i just want to first of all just to bring greetings to brother edd cater and i spoke with him on the phone a few days ago and he's always maybe to be able to uh come in and have some fellowship with us maybe in april month and uh yes to come in here for some reason uh uh maybe i don't know if it's see a doctor or not but we pray the grace of god be with him and we look forward to maybe fellowshipping with our brother in april amen and also to remind you lord willing it's been a long time but we need to take communion yeah it's been a long time and it's been been on my heart for quite a long time as well waiting waiting and so finally the lord reminded me again to to to to do it so the lord willing maybe it may be sunday we'll we'll see hello we're not allowed everybody's not allowed in church sunday oh well we'll wait and see see what happens amen so we'll have to we're asking the lord to give us his direction amen and to open a way whereby we can have the communion in for washing amen because right now the issue is even here in church everybody's supposed to be sitting at least six feet apart you know and so on they still want you to do that but again we pray the grace of god be with us even though our services are down to us to a half half of the congregation and so on so god help us and give us his leadership and his direction for the glory of god amen because i trust you understand it i trust you see it that we are living in a crazy world and we are living in an insane world there's nothing normal anymore what do you think your grandmother and grandfather and great-grandparents would think if they were to come back to this world oh as i said if your mind were to come back they would say forget it let us go back again they want they want to go on into glory again they wouldn't want to live here and the bride brothers getting to the place where the bride wants to get out of here amen and brother again god's allowing all this the ministry of the word and what's going on with their prophecy being fulfilled what's it for is to create in us the hunger and the first to get out of here by the grace of god how many israelis going to be satisfied with leaving going into the resurrection going into the rapture and why why that's good brother yeah but if you stop to consider you're going to leave a lot behind there's maybe a lot of friends you'll never see again there may be a lot of even family relatives you won't see again you will never have no fellowship with them no more you will oh yeah grace brothers that we're going to look for fellowship with the spiritual sons and daughters of god amen i'm not going to focus on the physical the natural focus on the spiritual by the grace of god it's exactly as the prophet of god said one time to his own natural family his his sibling brothers and maybe sisters and they met for the last time i believe it was at their mother's funeral and brother brown told him well he said when they separated and so on et cetera i guess you understand now you know he said we're not going to see each other very much anymore he said we've only seen each other because we come to meet we come to see mom he said and he said we we meet one another but he said now that she's gone he said we won't be back so we won't see another brother i trust grace that we're going to put the spiritual family ahead of the natural right of this there's still too many so-called believers they've got more answers on the spirit on the natural and less and less on the spiritual god help us amen god bless you let's stand thank you we're saying only believe amen only believe only believe all things are possible only be yes believe the word amen only believe oh only believe all things [Music] only believe jesus is here amen yes indeed praise the lord all things are possible amen the resurrection the rapture because jesus is here amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah all things are possible jesus is there lord i believe lord amen amen amen [Music] all things are possible [Music] lord i believe amen again lord that we believe with that complete belief that we would have no question and we'd have no doubt we believe god we believe your word lord amen we believe that it is written we believe that it is thus saith the lord amen it is father the word that you have amen predestinated for ordained lord for us to give us the faith that pleases you even in these last days father we're thankful lord for the faith that gave others father in previous ages but lord hallelujah but praying the grace of god to be with us lord to give us that word that will give us the faith we need in these last days lord the faith that we need for the resurrection the faith that we need for the rapture the faith that we need lord to get out of time and into eternity so we pray the anointing of the holy ghost and we pray for the moving of the of the holy spirit among us in us with us and around us giving us the truth giving us the revelation that truly we need in these last days lord hallelujah knowing o god that this is what you're requiring of us in these light in this hour hallelujah you have revealed this in these days lord because it's ordained to give us the faith that we need oh my lord my lord not just to believe you just say i believe god lord father we pray grace that we're moving on to a greater faith father above and beyond satan's ideas above and beyond satan's confessions lord that we're coming forth with the confession of your word we're coming forth believing the word for this hour believing the word for this day believing the word for this age amen so that lord that you will use us to make that word flesh you will use us to bring that word to pass in these last days that it it is written amen and it is made flesh in us oh my lord i pray grace that what you are doing and what you will do you're working it out in us hallelujah your sons and daughters by the grace of almighty god help us lord to let go and let you have your way not my will but thine be done amen that we'll give ourselves completely totally over to your control amen to your leadership amen lord that you will give us what we need hallelujah you'll lead us where you want us to go amen that you'll keep us in the spirit yes as written again lord that the sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god we walk in the spirit we live in the spirit amen father hallelujah because you are controlling us by your spirit grace lord pointing us to the resurrection pointing us to the rapture for the grace of god for the glory of god and for the change of the body of the bride from time lord we need to get to eternity amen we need to get out of just this flesh and blood and into the glorified body to give you the glory give

with you that i have all i have shared with you before how long ago i don't know it might have been a while ago and uh concerning spiritual warfare amen because we are in a war amen it is a spiritual war but brother i tell you this it's becoming more and more of a challenge to us in in in our physical beings oh yes the enemy is there brother he was there in the beginning challenging yeah the spiritual revelation amen oh you just believe just believe this believe that but he didn't want us to to go forth and apply it and brother but god wants us to apply it god oh yeah god's desire to apply it in our everyday lives amen to it is a witness to the world by the grace of god the witness to the world what god has done as a witness to the world what god's doing oh yeah so i i would would god be able to raise you up amen because the the prophet of god said oh yeah he said oh the devil was there and the unbelievers were there they didn't believe this didn't believe this but god said i did this i did that and he said he'll call you on the scene but he said do and what he'll do is you're short in the sky and oh yeah like we said a video he said and then you'll see a short oh there's you living jesus there's you manifesting the word there's you doing this doing that amen and it's a witness to the world and by it god will condemn them oh yeah they will be condemned by the witness that you're with you're doing by the life you're living oh yeah by your spirit and your attitude because when they come before god and deny this and deny that the prophet of god said he'll open it up and he said oh there's you he said you're you're manifesting what what they are denying god said oh yeah i was a witness look there's me he was in you he was in the brothers in the sisters in his sons in his daughters amen so brother can god use your life as a testimony as a witness of the word amen and by it he will judge the world praise the lord amen not just this but it's you and me the word in us because he made it flesh he made it real amen oh yeah this is the word here but i said i want to show it to you over there in this in this brother in this sister and this son in this daughter amen praise god god have mercy on us amen in 1st timothy chapter 6 and verse 6. but godliness with contentment is great gain oh my brother considering the separation unto the lord that comes with this word are we are we willing to stay separated oh just think are you willing in the resurrection rapture are you are you just willing to even looking forward to just going going into in the glory going into eternity getting into a glorified body amen and oh but there's family friends neighbors that you'll never see again unfortunately there's too many believers that are putting too much emphasis on their relationship with natural family and not the spiritual god help us amen he said but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be there with content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare amen and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows amen but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness amen god help us every day follow after righteousness the word made flesh in you and follow after righteousness and godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life where unto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses amen god bless you maybe it's heated fight the good fight of faith turn with me to ii timothy chapter 4. in verse 7. let's see in verse 5 he said watch thou in all things amen endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry amen make full proof of the life the christian life you profess amen for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day oh thank god for such faith amen and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing and he said do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for demeth has forsaken me having loved his this present world he handles too many believers that love they got more love for the present world than they do for the world to come amen brother if we got a love for the world to come we'll have a greater hunger and thirst for that for that world than for this one amen and it says having loved this present world i pray grace that we don't love it surely how in the world would you love it as i said our grandparents and the old generation to come back they wouldn't want to stay amen if they're a christian amen their faith in god they want to get out of here they wouldn't they wouldn't want to go out into that world no more what about us do we want to get out i pray god we do amen and he said is departed unto thessalonica he's a crescent to galatia titus under de la media and only luke is with me take mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable for to me for the ministry amen god bless his word amen so i want to share with you some thoughts and some quotes of the prophet concerning spiritual warfare i believe that abel he was involved in a spiritual warfare i believe all those that stood for god and believed god and believed his word and stayed with his word brother they were in a spiritual warfare because the amen the enemy was there to challenge their faith he was there to challenge abel's faith he's there to challenge at noah's faith and he's there to challenge the faith of the prophets the faith of the of the true sincere jews all the way down through the ages he's there to challenge jesus faith amen that's exactly the truth and brother he's there to challenge the faith of the bride and brother so much so that i believe there was something like so 60 odd million christians that were laid down their lives amen what for it was for their faith they were challenged even there was a time when there was a certain sister and they they she had a child there and they were going to kill the child and they they challenged the sister and they said all right they said if you if you don't deny what you what you say you believe they say we're gonna we're gonna kill this child and they said if but if you deny it then we'll let the child live and she said let the child die what would you take that stand as a mother as a father will you take that stand to let the child die to let let some other member of your family die amen would you have that faith in god amen and then and she was challenging their ideas she was telling me what they were thinking and they said you mean to tell me that you're going to let us kill the kill this son it's your son she said let him go she said she said we'll meet in glory amen she said if you kill him you kill me she said i'm going to meet him amen why because hallelujah he was going to get out of that body and into a glorified body amen so brother she had a tremendous faith and 68 million believers 68 million christians down through the ages lay down their lives for the gospel laid down their lives for the testimony that they were professing concerning jesus amen so brother how much are we going to lay down how much are we going to sacrifice amen for what we believe and because we believe this because we believe that and brother i tell you that more and more is going to happen in the world to challenge our faith they're challenging it right now concerning how we get together and how we worship amen that you can only have 50 of a church allowed to go in into a church and when you get into the church you got to sit maybe six feet apart amen oh yes more and more and more the enemy is going to challenge our faith them is going to challenge what we believe oh yes amen are we going to stay with it are we going to continue in the word amen amen we're going to continue believing the word are we going to continue worshiping amen according to the word the way that god wants us to do it or is it the way why are we going to let man control us amen i tell you as time goes on and then we know that quote but oh i pray grace lord i i'm thinking about it quite often and for the last two years and i said lord i said i wonder i said what are the believers thinking when what is their actions what is their reaction i said toward these covet issues and all that's going on and the rules and the regulations and the laws that are being made amen lord to con far as the world's concerned and the governments are concerned they're making these laws they're making these rules oh but it's for your good it's just to keep you from the from the the sickness amen oh yeah and then because if you if you get this sickness you're going to die oh yeah that's what and brother i tell you it's going to get worse and worse and worse amen and the worse it gets the more stronger and harder the rules are going to become amen oh yes most definitely if it'll come to the place we won't be allowed to do actually anything won't be allowed to get together with this one won't be allowed to do this this or this so i pray the grace of god brother give us the revelation that we need that will give us the faith we need amen the faith that we're going to take our stand for for jesus amen as they did down through the ages yes as abel did to cain brother and as noah did to all the others as the prophets did to all the others and as as the millions and millions and millions of christians did to the unbelievers down through the centuries amen for the last two thousand years so that all these millions were willing to lay down their life for what they believed amen brother what a faith and brother it wasn't just an idea it wasn't just a creed it wasn't just words in a book brother it was a revelation in their hearts amen and i trust by the grace of god that what we believe brother it's not just oh it's it's words in this book oh god said this god said that so i believe what's in the book or you know maybe what god revealed through the prophet and i believe this and i believe that oh yeah amen and but do you believe it in your heart or in your head amen amen is it intellectual or is it spiritual does it is it controlling not just your thoughts is it controlling your everyday living amen i oh yes the life you live every day is it governed by what you believe is it governed by what god has done and what god is doing is it governed by the the word brother the mystery of god that has been revealed in these last days oh my brother and again god is not looking just for someone saying oh i believe the message and then you go on and do this and go on and do that no no god wants you to oh you believe it he wants you to he wants to see it in you amen he wants he wants you to go out and reflect it he wants you to go and live it amen you look down and say oh they're believers look look at the life they're living amen oh yeah look look at their attitude look at their spirit or they must really believe me they must really believe my word they believe it really believe what i have done and what i'm doing amen and they really believe what i'm going to do oh yeah that's what god is looking at he's looking at the life we're living amen he's looking at the hunger and thirst we have in our souls amen oh yes he is what are they living for what are you living for oh well uh it's religion and i believe this and i believe that so that's why we shouldn't get join up with any denominations and so on no brother it's brother it's got to be more than that it's got it's got to be a power and anointing in your life controlling you for a reason amen causing you for a reason to do this for a reason to do that amen causing amen causing you to look up for what the resurrection to look up for what the rapture amen because the dead in christ shall rise first then we which our lord remained shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord amen i trust by the grace of god we got that faith and it motivates us it controls us amen it controls oh yes our thoughts our words our dates oh yeah when you're when you're going out there and looking for for a job to do and i don't care what it is amen whether it's your education whether it's job whether it's fellowship whether it's family friends neighbors amen you put it all brother it's controlled all by the word in you oh yeah oh yeah you're going to go you're going to go forth and and live amen and you're going to act and react to all the others as jesus did when he was here oh yes amen as jesus did did to his his natural family as jesus did to his spiritual family amen brother and as jesus did to the to the unbelievers oh yeah he had this attitude he had that spirit oh yeah and then they he was condemned for this he was condemned for that amen oh yeah you're not a christian because they feel if you're a christian that you're going to have a right attitude toward anybody and everybody out there no no you got to take your stand oh yeah as a question oh yeah you'll have your your attitude is going to be right but understand this they won't think your attitude is right if you're going to quote the word amen if you're going to stay with the word if you're going to witness of the word amen they think you're you're you're a religious fanatic yeah oh brother but yet no no your spirit is right your attitude is right but you stay with the word amen by the grace of almighty god oh my it's like again it's like it's like that oh my god elvis had that right spirit right attitude it's like i believe it was it might have been in france it was many many maybe years ago and these this this gentleman was walking down to a certain street there and he looked and they were they were killing christians oh yeah and he noticed that they had this woman there and they they were taking her up and they were going to put her down and and and and cut our cut her head off oh yeah and this man saw what what are you going to do oh is she going to do this going to do that because she she built she professes this and that oh he said don't do that he said he said let me do it he said let her go he said take my head off what this is amazing are we going to lay our lives down for one another like that amen as she lit as he laid down his life for her and they set her free and they killed him yeah trusting him believing by the grace of god he's in glory amen so brother see kevin you're having the right attitude right spirit because as jesus brother if you've got the anointing of jesus in your heart the anointing of jesus in your life brother you've got you're going to go for to live jesus you'll live like jesus live you'll testify like jesus testified you'll be a witness as jesus was a redness amen and it's stained for the truth keep your spirit right your attitude right exactly amen just like jesus kept his spirit right now to write when he met that woman at the well oh yeah but he knew what she had done he knew what her problem was and the disciples figured lord you because back in that day in israel and maybe it's still today that there was a time when when when those individuals came up to the well to get water and and and the others they knew that and they they would stay away from the well until until all those women had come up and all these uh these those that were sitting absolutely centers and living sinful they came up and got the water and went on and then the others would go get the water but jesus went to get water when she was there amen and he knew he knew what she was guilty of he knew what she had done amen oh but praise the name of the lord hallelujah his spirit was right for sure amen the disciples were there to criticize and condemn him amen god help us brother oh yes i've seen oh yes indeed i've seen even many believers keep a wrong attitude and wrong spirit towards just sinners out there not necessarily like that woman that owner he's a sinner jesus that are not having under them or or not only that or they're denominational they go to that church they go to that church oh yeah as i said i've seen i've seen many a believer take that attitude in that spirit first when i come to this message but that's what i was dealing with amen and that's and i and i mentioned it the last time i ministered i i i ministered when when i was asked to preach first time in my life just 18 or 19 years old and i and i read the scripture and why i said listen i said you're looking down your nose like this one this one this one because oh they don't believe the message they're going to this church they go to that church well that's that's us i said but for the grace of god so as grace for you i said pray the same grace for that woman pray the same grace for that man that brother that sister amen keep your attitude right amen brother after god had took the prophet off the scene they oh the news people that went and interviewed this one interviewed that one they're wondering what about the effect that that william branham's death and passing ad on other churches and other denominations other preachers and they and they went and interviewed a catholic priest and he was more than a priest in the catholic church and they interviewed him and they and he said my he said my and and he felt too that it was a total loss to the world for the going of william branham he said why he said my he said he said have you ever met william branham he says you if anything you knew you knew he had love he loved you they said yeah oh yes he said he said it's just just his nature and just that that that influence that he had oh yeah he said i i one thing that i knew i knew i said lord if william branham knows got anything he's got love he felt that spirit with him he didn't look down his noses amen that because that that that man that he was talking to was a priest no no he said no he said he had a right attitude a right spirit and he said oh he said i knew he said he loved me yeah he did would they know that or would you would they sense another spirit in you amen brother they knew that william brown was there to help them william brennan was there to encourage them oh yes god help us brother amen that we're not going to look down our nose because oh they go they go to this church they go to that church they go to that church brother brother we were there one time god brought us out amen god is there to bring them up keep your spirit right keep your attitude right amen by the grace of god amen brother we're in a spiritual warfare god help us brother that we're going to fight the good fight of faith it's going to oh and i'll tell you this is a good fight of faith it's you're going to have a right spirit and you're going to have a right attitude no matter who you meet by the grace of god probably god said he said now we thank thee that in this great hour that when all hopes of mortal life has finished he said atomic bombs are laying in hangars he said hydrogen bombs sickness disease and germ warfare he said oh he said everything the way they it is knowing that the bible said that man would actually rot in their flesh and he said amen but that angel was given commission don't you touch any of those do not come near those that had the wine and the oil don't touch those who have the seal of god upon their forage amen brother as it was then so it is now god is there to defend them god's dear defend us amen if we're taking our stand for the truth if we have the anointing the holy ghost and the life of god with us amen he's there to defend us amen he's there to defend you now i know that i gave this quote to a certain brother one time and oh it's just within hours that it when he preached he he condemned it not condemned the quote he condemned me for for applying it the way that i did because he felt he said that's just the jews no no because i said this was in 1960. the prophet mentioned in 1954 the prophet quoted again in 1964 amen and he and he and and it got bigger and bigger and bigger amen not just for the jews but he but for the gentiles amen as well boy he warned about the german warfare he said coming up on all without the holy ghost he warned of that and i got that quote here right here in 1954 and he said what is a cancer what is a disease he said we'll deal on that for the next five minutes now and he said what caused that thing he said or anything you wish to take he said tuberculosis pneumonia whatever you wish any disease is a diseases or germs and let me pass something here quickly and he said listen he said did you know the bible predicts that in the last days that there will be a germ warfare and he said that disease will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the holy spirit amen oh yeah that preacher went online and preached and quoted it and he said but he said that he said he's only talking about the jews not the gentiles but he not only probably applied it to the jews he applied to the gentiles he applied it to all amen what the german warfare brother he's not jews are going to have germ warfare we're all dealing with the german warfare amen and so he said listen it'll come upon all without the baptism of the holy spirit but with the angel or a church over these plagues was given orders to touch no one on whom the mark was amen praise the lord he said why he said how much kind of teachers have we got to he's a to be brethren to get the church in order to be in that condition church he quoted explain it to the church amen he said immune he said my arms are sore now from where the doctors had punched needles in to try and inoculate me said from yellow fever and he said and so forth and i told them i didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me but i'll tell you what god's going to do god's got to share them and it's called the holy ghost amen praise the lord hallelujah brother yes you get the holy ghost but at the same time if if if the required of a man wants you to take this take that will you you got to do it for a certain reason go do it and go on you're still trusting the lord oh yes you've still got faith in god amen amen so he said god's got a serum and it's called the holy ghost and when that serum goes in it'll inoculate you he said hallelujah in the last day praise the name of the lord so he said i would thank thee he said that he said without when all hopes of immortal immortal life is finished atomic bombs are laying in angers hydrogen bombs sickness disease germ warfare and he said everything the way it is knowing that the bible said that man would actually rot in their flesh amen but the angel was given the commission he said don't touch those who as the seal of god upon their forehead and we realize that the baptism of the holy ghost is the seal of god amen and brother that's the that's to guard us from the germ warfare amen that's to keep us from the german warfare god help us amen so brother in this spiritual warfare help us to recognize our weapons by the holy ghost amen amen and god will judge those who through fear pay more attention to the health and well-being of their physical bodies amen then the health of their souls yeah they're very concerned over their physical health and they're going to do this they're going to do this they're going to do that i'm going to do this i'm going to take this and take this home that's fine but even if you do that you're still going to have faith in god that it's going to work amen brother you've still got to have faith in god that whatever you're going to take well we should do this we should do that well if you even if you went to a doctor still trust the lord your faith is in god not the doctor your faith is in god not the medicine amen why because again the problem of god said he said god heals through doctors god heals through medicine yeah so brother i pray the grace of god oh god else to have faith brother go forth and live a life of faith that you believe god you're trusting god amen brother god help us he said the greater emphasis today is on physical health and financial prosperity but god will destroy both and if they kept their souls healthy with more and more of the presence of god he would give health and strength to the body as it pleases him amen we need more of the baptism of the holy ghost god's great vitamin amen brother we focus on natural vitamins what about god's vitamins lord bless these vitamins that we're taking and we're doing this we do that but lord i pray in the name of jesus that your vitamin is going to look after it all right amen and we realize that the baptism of the holy ghost is the seal of god it is written in ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption sealed for this seal for that now you're sealed on through eternity by grace amen and he said lord god seal this church tonight amen and those who are wanting the seal of the holy spirit kiss away every fear lord and seal them with thy seal of the spirit in their hearts that they'll come forth as newborn babes crying abba father granted lord i commit them to thee in the name of jesus thy son amen brother this is god's plan amen this is god's way yes to deliver us from this in the spiritual warfare from these germs from these diseases amen god help us just brother i've got nothing against taking this and taking that taking that and taking this no but but what what what you got to how you got to do it you got to do it by faith amen amazing that that man will trust man but are you trusting god oh man says this man says that no no just do this and do that and go on you're trusting god god help us brother more and more man is trusting man that's right that's why they're going to come under the antichrist why because their their greater faith is going to be in man not in god amen the enemy knows that the devil knows that he said listen he said that russia ever comes to the united states he said which is one of the leading nations of the western world he said they wouldn't want to blow it up and they could do it if they wanted to right now or they could blow that up but they'll never do it because they would destroy everything and they want the wealth of the nation and it says so therefore they'll try to put them to sleep they're not going to try they're not going to go out and and russia is not going to go and claim this nation that nation by bombs and bombs no they want the nation and they and they want the wealth of the nation they want this and that amen so that they've got all their plans oh yeah to control those nations are there plans to control america definitely he said one thing i do not think the war will be missile warfare but i think it'll be a spiritual warfare amen brother we're in a spiritual warfare yeah to get out of time and into eternity amen and brother the world's in a spirit in a in a warfare yeah but it's a political warfare amen a spiritual warfare because it was satan's influence you know using this nation to overcome this nation this nation to conquer that nation god help us brother we're not going to change what's going on out there i pray grace that we'll change what's going on here we can't change that we're not going to stop that but brothers anything we need to do is to be conscious of the spiritual warfare that we're we're into that we're fighting the enemy and how are we fighting the enemy amen brothers only on the weapon that god has given us is his word and the enemy is there to challenge the word oh yeah challenging what you believe yea god said but forget his butts stay with what god said amen again he said 1961 he said there is nothing really in the world that we can build our hopes on upon any achievement that we could give in this world because there aren't any hopes for it there is only one hope and that is christ amen and that's true amen in 1962 and he said we see that the astronomers are predicting sometime he said in this early part of the first part of the month they're beginning on the second somewhere along this month the indian astronomers are predicting the world to blow to pieces the american newspapers make fun of it i do not believe the world is going to blow to pieces but i do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something is fixing to happen one of these days and something similar to that he said when the five planets mars jupiter venus and so forth comes into their constellation he said they never have done it but oh my they claimed maybe 25 000 years ago but who was back there to know it he said i predict he says that this as a spiritual application amen man is applying it physically we're applying it spiritually amen he said i believe it's the coming in the issue of god and he said that great revelation of the word will be opened during this time amen remember they claim it was three stars coming into the orbit when jesus was born and this is five and five is grace amen five is the number of grace and he said remember is god sends god's grace sent it and god sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not our marriage oh no brothers by grace through faith we're saved we didn't none of us deserved it no it's about grace prevail to give it to us amen he said it may mean nothing i predict that there will be a change and i don't know what it'll be but i believe it is fixing to happen and we write on the eve of it right now oh my what would he say now what would he say now and if we knew god knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy was going to do he knew just exactly how to equip his people and if we noticed the very first thing that god equipped his children he said being infinite he knew what it took to defeat satan any time amen on any condition now he wouldn't say i will give them something here and then a few years later i may study out something better to give them and then after a few years later something else he said like we in the military force he said the old bull and arrow then a sledge rock hammer after the bow and arrow came the musket after the musket came the springfield and now now the atomic weapons see we keep going more but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he is the infinite god god goes he goes on to explain that god has given us his word yeah to defeat the enemy amen the word that they needed in abel's day he hated the word in the in the days of the prophets and the jews and the gentiles amen the church ages he gave them the word they needed they needed this word to defeat the enemy they needed that word that revelation and amen and he got bigger and bigger and bigger amen praise the lord unto finally the mystery of god was revealed oh hallelujah hallelujah the mystery of god revealed to the bride to give her the power over all the power of the enemy by the mystery of god praise the lord see you've got a greater revelation of the god you serve and that gives you more and more power over the devil amen and he said we knew god knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong he knew that the enemy was going to do what the enemy was going to do and he knew just exactly how to equip his people amen he knew what it took to defeat satan any time amen and he said now he said he wouldn't say i will give them something here and then a few years later i may study out something better to give them and then he said after a few years later something else and he said like we in military force the old bow and arrow and so on he said on to the atomic weapons and now he said we see growing more but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he is the infinite god amen why brother the weapon he gave him in the beginning the weapon he gave us now is his word amen and seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition and he said the right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they needed that would sweep them all the way from eden listen god give us what we need to sweep us all the way from eden to the rapture the devil is there to stop this stop this stop that stop that blessing that blessing and brother he's there to stop the rapture amen but god has given us what we need taking us from the eden to the rapture and he said what was it that god gave them he said it was his word where's our faith it's the word how many of us really are using the weapon as a word of the word against the enemy when the enemy comes in how many of us respond satan it is written satan it is written yeah well that's how jesus responded he was the example for us now you don't have to fight the devil just say the devil is there to fight you the devil's there to bring us down and god is there to bring us up now by the word oh satan it's written is written that's the weapon that god has given us against the enemy brother god help us please let's put more and more answers on the word of god by the grace of god on just two just too much champions i believe sometimes it's just on oh this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine oh my but brother we need to overcome the enemy that's there to fight us and there to discourage us he's there to weaken us amen we believe this we want to believe that we're believing this believe god god is doing this god's doing that and the enemy is getting that getting us trying to get us there to question it brother you better know the word then wonder he said thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee amen what a sin against god yeah unbelief it's the greatest sin oh well they did this they did that yeah but the end result the result of that is unbelief brother god thy word have i hid in my heart that we won't sin against god we want disbelieve god we'll believe his word amen it is written amen and he said you know in this warfare between nations there's a great warfare going on beyond that and he said that's the warfare between god and satan a great warfare and that was the first warfare and it is still raging and oh i'm so glad it'll soon come to an end hallelujah and he says satan has his agents out everywhere watching spying he said on god's people and god moves and he said the enemy is sitting everywhere watching to see what he can do and god's got some out there too he said we're thankful for what god's done and again in 1962 he said he said if the infinite god a god full of love to misconstrue his word just don't believe or they'll say just don't believe all of it just believe part of it know all of it he said well let all this happen because of just misbelieving a little bit of it i believe we're going to have to take every bit of it back again amen and we're going to take every bit to get back again praise the lord we must keep it that way that he said it and we're going to find out satan had to get attention amen remember we're in a warfare with god the men and women is his children and so he's in warfare with satan so satan comes down to use a tactic to try to counteract god's warfare amen listen he's trying to find something that he can a better weapon than the word so there is no better weapon that he could find so then the only tactic that he could use would be reasoning you don't reason it is written without reasoning amen thus saith the lord no reasoning amen no no there's still too many so-called believers reasoning they reason with the devil they're reasoning with with these feelings and these thoughts and this oh well this is just this this is just that well is it god or satan amen amen i tell you satan has got a lot of victory because people are just thinking that it's natural people they're saying that is normal no what what is god's will give satan the word amen brother brother sister we're not i'll tell you if the devil keeps us believing that oh this is normal this is normal so and we're going to experience this and experience as it comes and it goes and comes and goes brother god is challenging our faith because why because brother he's trying to get us to a rapturing faith amen and brother a rapturing faith is healing it is yeah it's not just a and again it's not just oh i'm just going to heal a portion of this no no the whole body is going to be healed completely totally well lord uh i'm sick i got this problem in my body well with your stripes i'm healed and it takes it away but still the body is still working and death is still working in the body yeah but the message of the hour is to give us the faith oh yeah a faith that goes beyond even death that conquers death hell and the grave that's for the resurrection and the rapture god help us amen jesus was trying to get martha to believe it what for the resurrection of lazarus and he said oh he's going to rise again and martha oh yeah you're right there's going to be a resurrection that was a doctrine he said i am the resurrection believers thou this there's going to be a resurrection oh yes but brother e that is the resurrection came in this hour the lord did descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the arcane the trump of god the revealed word amen and oh praise the lord amen going beyond luther going beyond wesley going beyond william booth going beyond the early pentecostals amen into this hour see what god did then to give them that faith to give them that faith that faith amen and what is what he did now in this hour is to give us rapturing faith part of god said that he said all that god has done he says to give us rapturing faith luther got the faith for justification and and wesley got the faith for sanctification the pentecostal the baptism and the gifts of the spirit and so on but now what god has done what god's doing is to give us all glory give us a rapturing resurrection rapturing faith oh my lord my lord help us to believe help us to claim the promise amen brother there was an hour when they said they tried to condemn luther any but he claimed the promise of the word that jesus justified him wesley claimed the promise that jesus sanctified him the pentecostals claimed the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit because it jesus promised it and jesus did it amen but now are we claiming the promise of the resurrection rapture god help us brother what god required in every age he always give the word to give the faith and now what god's required in this hour he's given the word to give the faith faith for healing yes and that's going to take us on to faith for the rapture faith for the healing of the body going on to the faith for the change of the body grace amen listen 1962 again the message putting on the whole armor of god and he said we find that this great enemy of god thought as long as that little family in eden keeps behind that word i can never touch them and neither can he today he'll still be still blocked off but he said if i can use some real good a strategy and he said just reason out and i give them some human reasoning amen because she's human and if i can just give him human reasoning then we'll win the battle satan and his angels and then eve give away to it and therefore we know our enemy by his attacks may maybe you didn't get it just to write the way i said it he said when anyone any spirit any person tries to disagree with god's word remember that's your enemy and we know his old attack he said that's the way he broke the human race down and that's the way he breaks them down today amen and that's the way he gets you away from god to disbelieve his word and the only way that you can ever stay in fellowship with god talk to him in the cool of the evening and he said is stay fortified in the word it's not feelings it's faith that faith again is not feeling it's the word thus saith the lord this is faith faith comes by hearing hearing by the word amen it is the gift of god amen and without faith it is impossible to please god so are you pleasing god tonight whether here or online are you pleasing god tonight what kind of faith is in control is it faith in control or religion i pray the grace of god that is faith in control amen and faith is governed by the word amen again there's too many that it's religion but it's not paid and not only that again the quote there's another quote somewhere where the prophet of god said you're in the message but the message is not in you he knew that so you're in the message is the message in you if the message is in you the message controls you the word of god controls you the life you live your attitude your spirit your actions reactions is all a reflection of the message it's just automatic you don't have it's not it's not well i got to do this i got no no because of the baptism the holy ghost you and the word is one and you just quote and just it's automatic god help us he said we know our enemy by his attacks maybe you didn't just get it again he said the way i said it be repeated he deceived eve but he used the word but he added to it god help us and sometimes the devil will use intellectual knowledge the devil will use intellectual reasoning he will use the influence of family friends and co-workers yes jobs material possessions what for to get us away from god's leadership what a compromise on the word god help us brother don't be deceived by intellectual knowledge don't be deceived by reasoning don't be deceived by the influence of family friends co-workers or jobs no no stay with the word if you're a seed of god sons and daughters of god the only thing that matters to you is the word you love the word you love love god you love his word oh yeah it's just automatic as i said because of your not natural birth there was a time when you would go out and you just naturally do what your mom would do do what your mo paul would do your grandma grandpa because you had that nature in control physically in your body but when you're born again from the inside out amen the pound the anointing is the soul controlling your human spirit and controlling your thoughts amen so it's not you that lives no more is christ living in you hallelujah yes a spiritual warfare brings you to christ and when you get to christ the spiritual warfare will keep you with him amen keep you in the word amen staying with the word by the grace of god the warfare is there to get you to doubt the word challenge your faith in the word oh yeah i believe but i believe but no we believe absolutely no buts get thee behind me satan amen so brother don't let the enemy use intellectual knowledge reasoning family influence friends or co-workers jobs material possessions don't let the enemy use any of that to get you to doubt the word amen every christian fights a battle every day we're in a warfare right now and we are going on constantly within us he said there is a battle between right and wrong shall we receive it what shall we do shall we bow to the world and shall we give up this thought that we got satan is challenging our faith amen bear with me just a couple quotes 1965 a thinking man's filter as i stood there looking at it thinking of how deceitful it was the question came to me and just seemed like something said to me but the slogan is all right a thinking man's filter is a smoking man's taste and it came to me that that deceitfulness in the natural realm there in the tobacco is something on the order of the churches today deceitfulness oh yeah that advertising was deceiving and he said we deal with the same thing concerning the bible the word of god for the for the day the enemy is here to deceive us he said it's come till the whole world has become a great deception of what is really true and what is right even in politics social affairs schools in everything we're witnessing and experiencing deceitfulness amen and he said that 1965 the message of satan's eden and he said that deceitfulness of the church of today amen he said see the son of perdition the devil and he said then people worshipping satan in this day and they think they're worshiping god it's serious you'd have to make your calling election sure make sure you're worshiping the right one they're worshiping the devil thinking they are worshiping god amen and maybe responding to the devil's ideas and thoughts thinking they're responding to god's idea thinking they're responding to god's leadership oh my make your calling election sure amen make your make sure that you have that right spirit that right anointing amen make sure it's the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth oh yeah remember it is 99 truth 1 a lie oh yeah he had one word yea well what he told eve he just added one word he said yet god said but forget the butts amen yeah that is the deception the church is experiencing today yeah no matter how much the word of god promised of this day is preached and vindicated they still won't believe it and he said oh sure you will not die but let me give you the reason why god said this and he quote he quoted this truth and he said it'll open your eyes and it'll make you no good and wrong and you'll be like god then if you can do it he said that's just what he wants to do and that's just the same thing same since the very beginning of eden and has been ever since he said in adam's time it was a deceit in noah's time it was deceit in jesus time it was the same and now it's the same today it is religious deceitfulness but he says stay with the word of god the whole truth and nothing but the truth amen remember the trail of the serpent deception and just watch how cunning is he said well they're just like judas and jesus there both brothers in their tribe just like esau and jacob and like the crow and the dove sitting on the same roost and everything in is a twin is this great warfare that we are in amen that's how deceiving it is he said the enemy uses deception like he did to eve oh god has said surely surely amen see trying to reason it beyond what beyond what god said originally amen and he said yea god has said but see that spray over it what god has said god keeps he don't need any help from satan he keeps it so don't ever be deceived by that amen praise the name of the lord oh i'll finish with these quotes the message is the token listen you say i believe yes i believe the message that's all right that's good but you must have the token he said do you hear brenham tabernacle you must have the token displayed amen without it all you're believing is in vain and you'll have you'll live a good life yeah you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it he said i'm talking about the applied token and the token agrees with every word amen it's got to because it is the word it's the life that was in the word he said my words are spiritual they are life said jesus amen my friends i don't want to hurt your feelings but he said i am responsible for a message and that message has come out of this mess and if i ask you to come out where am i going to take you he said would i take you to the brenham tabernacle he said it's as much fault as any of the rest of them there's many a message church better be careful because why because just think the enemy the enemy recognizes the word there so he's going to get in and try to influence it yeah and in message churches there's many there's there's influence even this message church the enemy is going to be there to try to get you to think this way think that way say this say that no no no no yes yes yes yes this but but but but oh yeah god help us but we stay with it the church because we're staying with the word but be on your guard amen by the grace of god and just think when he said would i take you to brenham tabernacle he said it's as much fault as any of the rest of them but there's one place i can take you you see where you're safe and protect protected from death and that is in jesus christ amen go to the church that's going to emphasize and put the emphasis on your personal relationship with jesus so there's not you living it's jesus living in you amen and he said that's the place i'm introducing to you tonight he said where god put his name and where he promised that he would meet every person that come in there he would worship with him and feast with him in christ not in the church no it's in the lord jesus christ brother you come here praying grace christ is in you and you are in christ amen by the grace of god again we still have a spiritual warfare amen no matter what oh my brother sister we think oh no no we get into the word you know that's it we're going to we're going to have this i have that yes no matter what you get into no matter what you associate with no matter what you identify with you're going to have that spiritual warfare amen so i pray the grace of god brother that we'll be as wise as the serpent harmless as the dove amen we're not going to be deceived by the enemy no no not by any means but we're going to have the victory through our lord jesus christ in this spiritual warfare amen hallelujah because that we're dealing with the devil yes but let's deal more with jesus amen don't listen to the devil but listen to jesus amen stay with the truth the whole truth and i tell you jesus is not going to give you any buts no you just say it's written it's written it's written thus saith the lord thus said the lord but no buts amen oh the devil is there to give you a butt but i pray grace that we're going to stay with jesus and have it is written and live by thus saith the lord amen by the grace of god let's stand amen amen and amen thank you lord praise the lord amen let's sing the old-fashioned song would you be free from the burden of sin there's power in the blood amen would you or evil a victory win there's power in wonderful power in the blood hallelujah there's power

not he said it's not smiling time anymore no god when you had this revelation that revelation they smiled they praised the lord they rejoiced hallelujah hallelujah amen but now brother it's different it's getting more and more serious so brother we're going to shout and praise the lord yes we'll smile when we get the glory amen and look at jesus because he said right here he said now he said no it's not smalling time now amen no because god wants a more serious spirit more serious attitude by the grace of god amen and only that he even the prophet back then under the reveal word he thought he lost his mind yeah concerning what the bible says and what religion was saying what all the churches were preaching oh my he thought he lost he felt like oh my i lost my mind you know because was
