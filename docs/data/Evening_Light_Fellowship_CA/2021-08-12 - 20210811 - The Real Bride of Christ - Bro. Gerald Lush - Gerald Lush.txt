belief no question no doubt amen praise the name of the lord amen now i believe praise the name of the lord hallelujah god bless you amen turn with me in your bible to ephesians chapter 2. amen the book of ephesians chapter 2 read a few verses and then i want to get into two other scriptures amen concerning the bride of christ and the real bride of christ amen by the grace of god considering whether and whether or not we are really truly the bride of christ that we have the bright material amen that he's looking for in these last days amen brother is not what he looked for in previous ages but brother what he's looking for today amen do we have the material amen do we have the faith that he wants us to have today amen brother we can go back again through the ages and and brother they they had when it comes to luther and wesley they did they did have a faith but whether or not the faith that the pentecostal said brother and by the grace of god well i tell you this that the brightest god of faith amen that the pentecostals didn't have amen because what does god do down for the ages by the word that he gave down through the ages he was increasing our faith amen because why because he was requiring more of one age than he did of the previous age until finally we get down in the last age and it requires perfect faith amen hallelujah because he justified him he sanctified him he filled them with the holy ghost he gave them the gifts of the spirit amen and they had the faith amen to receive what god was doing and what god had done but now brother in this hour god's requiring amen your chore faith for justification faith for sanctification faith with the gifts of the spirit amen and the baptism of the holy ghost but now he's looking for the faith for the resurrection and the rapture amen hallelujah because brother he was adding the adding to his word as it were increasing our revelation to give us more and more and more and more faith amen wesley had more faith than luther amen the pentecostals had more faith amen than the previous ages what was god doing he had what he promised he said i'm going to restore amen amen brother he knew that down through the dark ages oh yeah it started off with the power the anointing of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen signs wonders healing hallelujah proving that he was alive the resurrection by the great alias by the grace of god amen but he went into a dark ages and we we won't get into what what brought those dark ages but brother there was a dark ages and he went on went on and on and on but god said i'm going to restore amen and he's going to restore the truth hallelujah amen what was the truth was going to give us the the faith that would please god amen amen the truth was going to give us the faith that we need for the hour we're living amen father god restored the truth and he gave luther the faith that he needed wesley the faith that he needed amen and it was that went on into the salvation army amen that's a brother one time a ministering brother some years ago he's gone on to be with the lord now and he said brother brother drill he said what what what position is the salvation army in in god and what god has done and what god is doing brother damn through the ages he said oh he said he said luther had this wesley had this the pentecostal said that but what about the army oh i said the he said did the problem of god say anything i said he did and he always said i didn't know that so he said what did he say and i thought for sure that brother he was at the time he was much older than i was and i thought maybe that he knew what the prophet's saying no he said i don't know amen that's why i said well brother i'll let you know and he said he said brother he said that the wesleyans had organized so quickly amen brother because luther the lutherans went on a little went on to three or four generations before they organized or before them to try to make denominations and amen but he said the wesleyans he said all the way many within within a couple of generations he said they began to organize began to make denominations amen and god had to move on amen amen because brother i said because god god is not not making the nominations god calls us out of the denominations ain't master what for so that we're going to believe him that's right amen we're not we're not going to be limited to to just believe this just believe this as that church or that denomination no no god is going to set us free so we'll believe whatever he reveals right over he shows us in the word we're going to believe it amen and that's what he was what he had to do with with the wesleyans and the methodist because the organizer he said so quickly he said god had to raise up william booth he said with red hot salvation amen and he said to take the message on to the pentecostal revival amen and that's exactly what they did and because they went from from the lutheran to wesley to the salvation army and i'll tell you this but when william booth and his wife they were coming down to the end of their their message coming down to the end of their call amen oh they were they were recognizing oh yes oh yes well we're getting we're getting too organized we're getting to two to two months like a denomination and oh he said what we need just think this started this and that not even not in pentecost but it was the salvation army and they were preaching it they said what we need is what they had on the day of pentecost oh they said yeah yes he said we need the power we need the anointing of the holy ghost they say we need that we need god to take control amen and so they were pushing the people on to to what god was going to do next and that was the pentecostal revival amen amen and now we're going beyond the pentecostal revival to our bread revival by the grace of god amen and brother the pentecostal oh yes what's what's god doing he's increasing our faith amen from luther and wesley and on down to the salvation army on into the pentecost increasing our faith to believe god amen they believe god for the baptism of the holy ghost they believe god for the gifts of the spirit amen but brother we believe god for that as well amen but what else is god requiring of us amen because when we go beyond that now what what is god going to do he's done that amen they had those revivals they got those revelations amen thank god but what what's not what's now amen brother now brother look up because when you see this when you see that the bible says look up amen because it's the resurrection and the rapture amen they're a ministry and a message that will give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen brother a revelation brother that's going to give us faith not to look there and just look there and look there look up amen oh they looked at luther they looked at wesley and looked at this one and this revival of that revival oh yeah but brother the bright revival look up amen so i pray god in the name of jesus that we're getting less and less and less attached to this whole world less and less attached to what's going on in this world now i tell you the devil is the devil is doing everything that he can amen to attract your attention he's doing everything you can in order to get your all to get you to for to focus on this to focus on that what's going on in this whole world no brother what god wants us to focus on is what's going on up there amen look out because the dead in christ shall rise first amen and those who and then and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them amen amen but you're going to get caught up i'll tell you this you've got to be looking up that's right amen you've got to be hungry and thirsting for the resurrection hungering and thirsting for the rapture because what god has done now in this hour this age is to give us the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture give us the faith that's going to create in us to hunger and thirst for what god wants to do amen don't look back look ahead let's move forward by the grace of god we think we're not we're not denying what he's done praise god for what he did but has given us the faith to go forward amen by the grace of god amen so god help us brother to have that faith in this hour that god is looking for amen not just the faith he's looking for the faith we need the faith we need amen brother and the going forth of the word has got to give us that faith give us that faith brother get let's get into the revelation they oh yeah so that what it's going to give us the revelation of who we are amen oh they were lutherans they they were justified others sanctified amen baptized with the holy ghost oh pentecostals and so on yeah well thank god we believe it but now god's looking for the bride amen not just oh that just this with just this one this is one that one that plus amen amen brother what was he doing he's building up our character building up our faith amen oh brother brother oh yeah the the the lutherans oh well they were justified they lived justified lies amen but not sanctified amen oh yeah oh they just say god oh lord we're justified jesus justified us jesus justified us amen so we don't have because the youth had to do this and do this and do this for and to think oh this will justify me if i do this brother they were already justified jesus did it amen amen same with with again the lutheran or the methodists amen they were they discovered they were sanctified and you know what they you know and john like i said john wesley where did he get that revelation he was he was in a lutheran cottage meeting he was yeah in a cottage meeting praise the lord hallelujah and and john wesley was there and then of course luther was going on but they were believers that believe what god had done in luther through luther amen they believed in justification and when while our our brother wesley was standing there and and the brother was preaching preaching preaching and he was laying it in laying it in oh why it struck luther john wesley and brother the anointing went for he said the anointing went from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet but what what what did he get he got a revelation amen as god had justified him god had sanctified him praise the lord because hallelujah because their brother wesley thought that we had to go do this and for to to sanctify our our lives sanctify our all this and now our faith and so on no he got the oh jesus justified us jesus sanctified us oh he is my sanctification amen he's my justification he's my sanctification amen and brother he and of course he was for pentecost the baptism of the holy ghost is christ in them amen it's jesus and brother he is our resurrection and he's our rapture it's jesus praise the lord brother's getting hallelujah it's getting more and more and more into a relationship with jesus don't leave jesus out amen their denominations are there and they got this revival that revival but jesus is left out amen it's a doctrine but brother it's jesus it's a person it's god amen and coming into this revelation of the resurrection of the rapture brother amen it's not this is not me it's not this is not william branham amen the resurrection rapture is jesus he is amen oh yes he is brother he was there to bring lazarus forth oh yeah and he said don't you believe it that he'll come forth and then and and the sister said oh yes he'll come forth in the resurrection in the future he said i am the resurrection amen brother is not up there it's right here it's in you amen is christ in me the hope of glory brother we have come into that revelation now of the resurrection and rapture it's jesus amen that he revealed himself as the justifier he revealed himself as he asked the one that sanctifies us and he's revealed himself as the one that baptizes us with the holy ghost christ in us hallelujah brother he anointed us he did this in our lives he did that in their lives hallelujah and then he come himself into their hearts into their souls into their lives brother he's come to take control now to get us home take control to resurrect us and rapture us amen it's christ in me the hope of glory praise the lord god bless you turn again ephesians chapter 2. and verse 1 says and you at the quickened resurrected yeah again like i said i preached this one time and i just said to the church the congregation there was three or four hundred there and i said i just want to let you know i've been resurrected everything got quiet nobody moved looking at one another and even the and i said yeah i want to let you know too i've been raptured what and i noticed the pastor was sitting in the audience there and he turned around looking at his audience and he said no oh i said i i oh i think i've shocked you i said i just want to let you know i have been resurrected amen i've been raptured and i said i'm going to be resurrected and i'm going to be raptured i said i've been resurrected and raptured spiritually and i said let me let me show you in a word oh amen i read the word oh that was different then they started to say amen praise the lord oh yes that's right brother amen oh they were shocked so i pray the grace of god brother that we are getting to the revelation amen that we are resurrected spiritually we are resurrected amen raptured spiritually we are brother and i pray grace that it's it's it's moving us on to the physical the physical resurrection the physical rapture my lord my lord lord give it brother we got the faith for the spiritual we're going to have the faith for the the physical god help us all right this this proves right here that we have been resurrected and we have been raptured spiritually and it says again in verse one you at the quicken or resurrected who were dead oh he's made me alive i was dead in sin you were dead in trespasses and sins and where in times past he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air and the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience we are children of obedience not disobedience amen by grace among whom also we all add our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us amen even when we were dead in sins as quickened us together with christ amen quicken resurrected us by the grace of god amen and it says by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together amen he's raptured us up into christ he has raised us up together and made us sit together praise the lord in heavenly places in christ jesus so we were resurrected in christ we're raptured in christ we're caught up in christ hallelujah into the spiritual dimension amen and what's going on there there the words being revealed amen and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves amen it is the gift of god amen not our works lest any man should boast amen we are his workmanship created in christ jesus praise the lord unto good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them god bless his word you may be seated amen and turn with me to ii peter chapter 1 praise the lord second peter chapter 1. and beginning to read well let's start at verse one simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god amen and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord amen according brother without jesus we're lost amen without jesus we're helpless amen without him there's no way that we can please god without him there's no way that we can receive what we want when it comes to his blessings amen it's the faith that god is looking for in you and me god help us and again verse two again grace and peace be motivated unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord amen and it says according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue amen whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature amen are we partakers of the divine nature of jesus amen are we reflecting the nature of jesus are we reflecting the life of jesus amen are reflecting what jesus did for us grace and having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this it says giving all diligence add to your faith virtue amen and to virtue knowledge brother this is the life of faith yeah we're going by faith brother sister we start this way and we keep on going going and we're growing in faith and god is heading to our faith god is increasing our faith god has given us stronger and stronger faith amen brothers brother because we need it amen it is by grace through faith we're saved and then not of ourselves it is the gift of god amen god has given it to us why because whether we can't get it without god and and where where did where how does he give it to us through the revelation of his word amen faith comes by hearing the word amen for your day amen that's what gave luther the faith that he needed in his day wesley the faith that he needed in his day amen the pentecostals of faith they needed in their age brother now the word is giving us the faith we need praise the lord the pentecostals went forth preaching what they preached amen manifesting the gifts that god had given them amen but the bride is going forth now believing what god has done but believing what god is doing amen what's he pointing us to now brothers not don't don't go back to just to jude luther and westeros back to the pentecostals no no brother he is pointing us to the resurrection now and to the rapture amen through the word now he wants to get our focus and our attention on the resurrection to get our our focus and attention on the rapture amen and to give us the faith this is the hour look up your redemption draweth nigh amen so whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises alleluia that by these she might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge is not just becoming part of a church and that's it no no you're going to mature you've got to grow amen and you're you're going to mature as sons and daughters of god praise the name of the lord brother it's one thing to to come in and oh yeah well i i believe this and i believe that well that's good amen but as you stay under the word god's going to increase the revelation the revelation amen and when he increases the revelation he's going to increase the responsibility that he has in you amen oh yeah brother god required us a justified life and and luther lived it amen amen god required justified and sanctified life in wesley say and they lived it amen and again in the same with the salvation army they they lived that justified sanctified life amen but now god is requiring a justified life a sanctified light amen under the pentecostal revival the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen now you're going to all praise the name of the lord you're going to you're going to walk in a higher level than luther did you're going to walk on a higher level than wesley amen why because now you've got the anointing and the baptism of the holy ghost by the grace of almighty god but now brother alleluia thank god in this hour and in this age brother we're walking on a higher level than luther panic or wesley or pentecost how many amen oh oh you are or if we're walking on a higher level than luther and wesley and then the pentecostals oh where's the gifts oh well thank god for the for the revelation the prophet of god said oh yeah we still we got justification we got sanctification and he said oh yeah we still got the gifts of the spirit he said but he said to think of it is the gifts are just laid right there on the shelf and he said they're there if you need them amen well because there was an hour in the pentecostal revival they needed the gifts amen and the emphasis was on the gifts amen to get their attention to what god was doing amen to believe what god was doing amen but then there come another time amen when brother god was getting us into into another revival that he was going to require of us oh yeah the faith for justification sanctification the gifts amen but now he was going to require of us the faith for the resurrection and the rapture amen oh they believe for justification they believe for sanctification amen they believe for the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen but now god has given us the revelation the word amen of the resurrection and the rapture amen brother the thing of it is those that those that are denominated all they just go that many of them are still no no higher than than justification they're no higher than sanctification amen and that's why they're still back in those denominations and others are no higher than oh yeah than the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit and brothers there's not many even with that because i tell you this there's just very few that got the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost today of pentecost oh yeah it's not not like it used to be not by any means because i remember back back in in the in the maybe the early 60s amen oh yeah you brother gerald you yes i'm that old amen in there in the early 60s amen i was

back back then they they had the bible right here amen and they had oh yeah i've seen them i've seen them i have one one after another one after another brother they weren't afraid of the weather no no it was jesus amen he had he had their pre-empha in their hearts in their souls and they're walking up walking the church walking the church amen an old brother and they they never had to walk a minute or five minutes sometimes they had to walk maybe a half hour what oh yeah they had to walk a half hour and go on up to the church oh yeah salvation army or pentecost oh you seen that i saw it amen i experienced it because there was a time when when i wanted to walk a half hour to a church at filling house or church amen you did yeah we didn't bother us oh half hour that's nothing the lord be with us the lord will help us amen who's giving god the preeminence in their hearts who's giving god the primes and their souls brother we're living in this hour we're living in the states we're living in this world where everybody wants everything oh everything but god got to work this way everything got to work that way oh yeah it's got to oh yeah oh lord if this is you you're going you're going to you're going to work it out you're going to make it better oh god sometimes god is doing it do it this way to test your faith yeah to see how much you believe it amen how many was going to walk to this church for a half hour and there's going to some some would even walk back then they would even say take an hour to walk to church amen oh yeah and knowing that they'd always show up the church a half hour before the service was was was specified to begin if the service was going to be going to be seven o'clock they were there 6 30. that's right amen oh yeah and not only in the old-fashioned salvation army but in the old-fashioned pentecost they were there a half-hour before the service was going to start and they would come in and they'd go go up around the altar amen they'd be all needed at the altar and praying oh today oh church of seven oh they'll get there around seven maybe five minutes after seven god help us amen brother walking yeah walking this gives the glory to god amen he brother he laid down his life what about you laying down yours that's right considering the sacrifice that he made but what sacrifice are we willing to make brother people just take it too lightly when it comes when it comes when it comes to what jesus did when it comes to amen the communion when it comes to the remembering jesus laying down his life amen the crucifixion oh yeah just takes it to too lightly oh yeah oh jesus did that yeah well thank you lord what take it lightly like that brother how many would it would even have oh my lord how many got the spirit that william branham would have that even our brother billy paul is some one time red dead cut got a certain thing because he he was there and he was waiting for brother branham to come to the pulpit and so oh he was he was a bit delayed so he went down to the office wherever william branham was and oh and he apparently he opened the door i think and brother brown was on his knees oh praying yes well just think what he said and he and brother billy ball heard him say oh he said he said lord he said forgive me he said i i don't mean to interrupt you and he said i know there's other many others he said that are that are calling on you and he said forgive me what do you ask god to forgive you do you take that into consideration that they're that you you're just one of the millions maybe that are praying and that are calling on the lord yeah and he said forgive me he said lord but he said i i just forgot this i just want to to remind you of this oh yeah and he and he told him they told that and he said thank you lord amen amen oh and many of us ask god not just forgive us of our sins how many are there conscious of interrupting maybe what god's doing god help us amen how many have such a personal relationship with god amen the god is not just an object there or or is this there and he's that there oh that's god that's god no amen how many really really got a real personal relationship god help us amen bear with me i want to get into those three scriptures and i want to share with you some thoughts that william branham did express concerning the bride and the attitude of the bride concerning jesus amen god help us i tell you if there's anything i tell you this if there's anything that brother that the salvation and redemption hallelujah and the call of god in our lives does it humbles us definitely amen if there's anything the bride is she's humble amen anything that the seed of god is their humble the sons and daughters of god are humble amen thinking giving god the glory and thanking god for what he's done and thanking god for what he's doing and thanking god for the patience he's got with you amen the patience has got with me thank you lord amen why because in our lord jesus christ we recognize truly absolutely completely lord i'm a sinner saved by your grace amen thank you jesus amen praise the name of the lord so he's asking us to come with faith but add to your faith and to your faith these these qualities by the grace of god so again in verse 4 he said whereby you are given unto us oh thank god amen we are here because of what he's given us praise the lord encouraging us to keep moving on encouraging us to keep believing keep trusting amen to keep praising him praise the lord given unto us great and precious promises brother praise the lord but for the glory of god claim the promise for the glory of god amen whatever the lord you promised to do this you promised to do that amen and there are so many that are so selfish yeah self-centered lord do this lord do that but brother sister god looks for the attitude in the spirit amen that's calling on it and brother if you're really really really really a child of god a seed of god you're going to be humble amen and you're going to give god the glory oh yes you're going to humble yourself when you come into his presence considering what he has done for you oh my oh my oh my as i said it was one time it struck me oh concerning grace by grace i'm saved through faith and that not of myself it is the gift of god amen and i i was considering myself and i said oh my lord i said it is grace you consider yourself that you were born in sin you were shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies oh yeah oh i'm this and i'm that oh yeah no brother we're nothing but by the grace of god that's the truth amen brother without grace brother it's grace it is i said lord it's true truth it is absolutely i said amen it is absolutely unmerited favor when i consider myself amen when you consider yourself in the light of god in the light of the word you know you're unmerited amen that's right amen if it gives you any revelation lord brothers gay gives you the revelation of our merit amen that's right lord it is grace amen by grace i'm saved it is by grace that you do this it is by grace you do that i don't i'm not worthy of the lord amen so lord i'll give you the glory if now don't tell god god do it god do it god do it lord i pray your grace your will not mine amen just think even our lord jesus christ if it's an example that he gave us was when he was praying in the garden amen and he cried and he cried and he cried not my will father thine be done we want we want god to do our will no no brother get get get the anointing of the holy ghost amen so you're going to seek the will of god amen live the will of god by the grace of god amen and he said in verse 5 and he said besides this giving all diligence diligence and to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and brother it's going to be godly virtue and god's knowledge amen and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness praise the lord brother it's surrendering more and more to him to get to get to get this he's got to be more and more in control oh yeah i've got to be more and more dead to the world and dead to the flesh and more alive to him amen so that it is god in control amen it's not me that lives this christ that liveth in me amen praise the lord hallelujah so brother sister in your faith in your religion is it you live it are you living that life oh we we read the book or we read this and we read that oh yeah so i'm doing this and i'm doing is it you doing it or is the holy ghost in you is it god in control there's too many got religion you know it's just religious but i'm in here spiritual there's a lot of religious people oh yeah but brother we're not saved by religion no not by any means it's by this it's by the spiritual revelation of god amen so brother add to your faith virtue amen and add to your virtue divine knowledge of god more and more knowledge of the will of god the leadership of god in your life is god in control grace god help us how many are like christ in the garden not my will father thine be done oh brother we we've got to have that will we got to have that attitude yes we do not we got to have it if you've got the holy ghost christ in you you'll have it because if christ is in you he's going to he's going to reflect it in your life amen but he lived in that flesh he'll live in yours praise the lord amen so he said to your knowledge he said had temperance and to temperance patience and patience godliness and brother these are godly attributes that's what he's looking for in you amen we can't oh we have had if we want to add to it we got to surrender more to to the lord amen and the more we surrender the more of him he's going to manifest and reveal in you hallelujah he's taking control hallelujah he's got so much control that now it's not you that not know you that not him yeah you're not you that lives it's christ living in you that's amazing how many of us can really truly say it it's not me that lives

listen again if it's not you that lives and christ living in you then brother he's going to control your thoughts he's going to control your actions you control your your reactions oh my lord help us yes amen that he's going to be control of our spirits because we got a spirit and the devil is there working oh yeah to get to get us to oh react this way to react that way or he puts to be putting us under the pressure to do this challenging us to do this challenging this way but i'll tell you if you got the holy ghost you're going to you're going to respond as jesus would amen you're going to act as jesus would act you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna talk as jesus would talk amen if you got his spirit god help us there's too many brother i tell you the devil in control not jesus amen god help us make sure you are dead to yourself and alive to to our lord jesus christ amen brother if you're dead to yourself you're going to be dead dead to the influence of the devil in your life amen and jesus has got more control get be behind me satan yeah satan is there to tempt you they on if jesus is in you jesus says satan get away if he's in you he will brother i tell it we need jesus we need him every step of the way by the grace of god because satan is is there constantly to weaken us he's there constantly challenging our thoughts our words and our deeds jesus is there to give us victory over the world the flesh and the devil but we've got to walk in the spirit and we've got to live in the spirit so that it if you walk in the spirit live in the spirit jesus is in control amen praise the lord why does a certain individual why do they live this way act this way oh my they they don't act like this they don't they would never say things like this never i react this way or that

things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see you far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence see put diligence into your faith but diligence into your your stand for the gospel you stand for the word you put your heart into it you're really there you really mean it you really believe it amen you're really sincere in it amen brother and you're not there to all just fight somebody no no

well i'll be yourself and thank jesus for it amen stay humble by the grace of god amen again either lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall thank god if you do these things with her brother i tell you this you'll have a right attitude and a right spirit and you will never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ amen and again i will not be negligent to put you always always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth amen just three or four verses in one other scripture amen revelation chapter 19. amen bear with me revelation chapter 19 and beginning to read at verse 5 through verse 8. and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye is servants and he that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of many thunderings saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth amen there were three voices that they heard praising the lord and let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready praise the lord grace brother sister are we the real bride and making ourselves ready and entering into the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride yep by the grace of god so let's be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and brothers to righteousness imputed to them by our lord jesus christ brother are we truly according to the scripture the real bride of christ do we have the character the nature of the bride of christ do we have the hunger and thirst of the bride of christ do we have the love of the bride of christ our brother random said 1962 and is a message that he preached in phoenix arizona called the marriage of the lamb praise the lord and he said that's what's the matter he said with the church today he said universally speaking that she needs as scouring out and there's still a lot of believers that need a scouring out i remember many years ago a certain sister called me on the phone at that time she was an elder older sister and she might have been maybe almost 80 years old and she said brother she said please she said i want you to pray for me she said i ne i feel she said that i need a scouring out and i was surprised considering who the sister was i said you you really need that sister yes she said brother i do she said i feel she said the lord's been dealing with me she said so she said it's been heavy so she said i felt to call you and ask you to pray for me i said okay and so i had prayer for her and i dealt with her not long after that amen when the lord was getting her ready to take her home yeah i had the counselor an encourager concerning your faith or stand for the word of god amen her faith in the lord jesus christ she knew she was going to god be the glory amen so brother sister she needed a scouring out how many of us feel that we needed a scouring out yeah god judging you by the word tonight do you need a scouring out amen god scholar and got her ready and again even after she was gone i'm not sure how long it was but then another day i get another call on the phone and it's a it's a brother and he was again maybe close getting close to 80. and he said brother please pray for me he said i i need i need he said the lord's help i said brother what's wrong oh he said i don't know brother but he said please that the lord would give me his rest and his peace in my soul oil and he had been a a christian or well i'll be honest he was a pastor and i prayed for him and the lord got him ready to take him home and again i don't know maybe five years ago i'm not sure another brother called i said lord i said what's going on why are they calling me and that brother was a ministering brother and he said brother please i need your prayer so he said pray for me because he said i feel sometimes i feel like i've missed it i need you to pray for me so i prayed for him but it was three months later and the lord took him home so brother sister i pray the grace of god please make our calling an election sure don't assume everything is all right make make sure it's it's all right consider that you may have to go today yeah and then if you're called home today that you'll be ready to be part of the bride of christ it's serious and i also i've had to deal with other issues with people of believers yeah that the lord was calling praying that the lord would encourage them praying that they would have the faith to go home to be with jesus grace brother no wonder that jesus said that when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth because all the way down through the ages faith decreases not increases it decreases amen so brother praying the grace of god to give us the faith that he's looking for in the bride not out there in a church or there's going to be there's going to be many outside the city but when it comes to being the bride and in the city there's there's not going to be many in these last days i believe that most of the bride is called most of the bride is ready amen they're there but in this hour and in this age they're getting fewer and fewer and fewer well somebody said to william branham one time they said brother what would you do if god asked you to go and pick out the bride or out there in the in these today or this this this hour this age he said sister he said i'd be frightened he said i might find a dozen a dozen well that's what he was experiencing back there so little faith brother i pray god that we have the faith that pleases god dad we have the faith that we need that we love him we love his word we love one another amen and i'll tell you this if your bride you love one another if you love him how can you love him and not love your brother and sister can if you love him and you got his love in you well consider who he loves and you will love them by the grace of god so he said what's the matter with the church today universally speaking she needs a scouring out she needs a filling up with god's holy waters from heaven her heart has become a cesspool of anything that comes along and she's got lovers of all kinds the bible said she'd have lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god truce breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are right brother again he said did did you ever notice what the real church is supposed to do in the old testament when they had the sacrifice they killed one bird and put the blood of one upon another the living mate and it flew across the earth spreading the blood of the dead mate when the church becomes the real bride of christ he said shall carry the blood of jesus christ with her and sprinkling it upon the ground and calling holy holy holy unto the lord her atmosphere or every bit of her will every bit of her will be of god her whole makeup will be of god and you can't expect nothing else and he said that's why people come to church he said not to play cards and play poker not to dance in the basement and have soup suppers and things like that that's for the world and he said we'll never be able to compare with them and shame on us for trying it we should preach the holy ghost and power preach the resurrection of christ we've got something they haven't got let us live it not try to copy after them but live what we know is right live in christ amen god help us that we're going to live our lives in jesus name that is going to be christ in control of you morning noon and night god help us keep your attitude right your spirit right your motives and objectives right amen in the message perfect faith he said jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god and he says if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world oh brother is your life causing you to be a mystic to family friends or neighbors wondering what makes you so odd the way you live the way you act what you do what you don't do amen but yet in it all your spirit is right your attitude is right they know that but still you live a separated life onto the lord amen so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into a bright material you're getting into a rapturing condition amen if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it he said you are coming into perfect faith hallelujah yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith so is it now with those who have perfect faith they are a mystic to others god help us he said we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us to resist what is to resist he said it means just to turn him down amen if he got thoughts turn it down feelings turn it down stay with the lord he said just resist the devil he said that is it just walk away from him because god said a certain thing and no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to the devil he says your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says amen and he said to he that hath an ear that listens see what the spirit saith unto the churches the one that's got the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches hallelujah brother there are some that are too sensitive to what the devil is saying and they're getting less and less sensitive to what god is saying amen god help us to get more and more sensitive to what jesus is saying what god is saying to us in these last days considering what's going on in the world brother we better have jesus in control amen so he's going to let us know what's going on oh we're listening to listen to the world listen to what's going on this is going on especially with the coven issue and so on oh yeah should we do this should we do that follow his leadership do what he wants you to do by the grace of god oh yeah and i know all due respect but they're believers that want there's some believers that they won't go out you know and get these uh injections isn't it and then they get those needles they oh no that's the devil they think that's the devil deceiving them do this do this well they feel that they want to trust the lord well god heals through medicine the prophet god said that he said god he was through medicine he said god he was through doctors yeah because there was a certain sister one time that was came in the line for a prayer and he said sister and they said you he told her to do this this was going to happen he said you're going to be on the bus and he said when you get off the bus he said you're going to meet another lady their sister there on the street on the sidewalk and she's going to recognize that that sister was sick and oh she said what's your problem oh this is the problem and she said she's going to refer you to a doctor what yeah he said she's gonna oh dr so-and-so he's he's down in a certain area there and they said you you go see him and he he'll look after you you'll do that don't worry about it and that was exactly what she was told when she was in the prayer line yeah and she did it and she did get off the bus and that lady was there and that lady got her attention when she saw that she seemed like she was sick and now oh she said you should go see this doctor and she went and saw him and she got well she never had no problem after brother we need leadership we need spiritual leadership of the holy ghost amen oh i believe there's time when when when your faith is just leave it with the lord but yet there's other times your faith is you'll lead you this way you'll lead to that he might lead you to a doctor he might need to do this do that brother i pray grace god help us god give us holy ghost wisdom holy ghost leadership oh my [Music] oh he said just walk away from the devil he said god said a certain thing and no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to to satan he said your ears are deaf and so on and he said to he that add the nearer let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and the one that's got the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches amen i'm skipping a lot of these things here it's to save time and he said again he said it takes more than a good message from the pulpit is that it takes your life and it takes you to get ready amen in revelations the 19th chapter the bible said that speaking of the bride of christ she has made herself ready amen and you as a member of this bride you've got to make yourself ready amen line up with the word and the will of god with a right spirit and a right attitude by the grace of god amen he said listen he should die to your dirty self amen praise the lord and he said die to the sins of the of the flesh be borned again and new and if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god's not even in you he said that's right so listen he said say i don't believe in holiness no wonder you can't but the bible says without it no man shall see god because god is holy and if god lives in you you are holy too amen and tell me you can go out on these parties and drink a little sociable drink why the pentecostals do that they go out on these parties and take them women out there and live in these places and go down and strip themselves off in bathing suits and go in swimming before men when your husbands he said and your brothers and sisters and so forth and the pentecostal people going out in bathing suits and calling yourself a member of the bride the bride of christ don't do those things the bride of christ is separated onto the lord and she lives for him not for herself but you're living for jesus reflecting jesus thought word and deed amen in the 1960s there was questions on the seals would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture and he said that's what's going on right now it is the message of the hour the bride of christ and she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors he said that's right that's the bride of christ and she got a ministry a great ministry but it'll be so humble by the grace of god amen did we finish with this quote here he said the bride will have to be you know the unadulterated word not one word missing nowhere could you imagine a correct bride one breast off and then other ones something or some other wrong he said that's not going to be the bride of christ she's perfect amen she's re she's everything the word not one word failing anywhere the bride like the bridegroom is the word amen in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwell among us and the word is made flesh in you and me it was it made flesh in the bright room and the word is made flesh in the bright by the grace of god i pray god help us it's my prayer amen that we'll go forth yes with the spirit and attitude actions and reactions showing that we are the true bride of christ by the grace of god right attitude and a right spirit god bless you amen let's stand 380 a glorious church amen do you hear them coming brother thronging up the steeps of light cladding glorious shiny garments blood washed garments pure and white to the glorious church without spot or wrinkle amen praise the lord washed in the blood of the lamb grace to us wave the banner shout his praises for our victory is nigh we should join our conquering savior we shall reign with him on eye praise the lord i pray grace that we continue on in the word as the bride of the lord jesus christ amen that we are moving into the resurrection they're moving into the rapture by the grace of god and that we will reign with him in israel by the grace of god understand again [Music] a correction that i had to do when i first covered around this message because believers believed only message believers were saved oh and all the rest were going to hell they were lost but they weren't because remember the the when it comes to the message that's the bride and the bride is going to sit with him and he's strong amen the bride is going to be with him in the new jerusalem but she's going to reign over those outside amen so there's many many others that are going to be saved but not bright not the bright so i pray the grace of god amen that we are bright amen and we are we are entered into a union with our bridegroom and he's calling us home amen to the new jerusalem let's sing it the glorious church do you hear them
