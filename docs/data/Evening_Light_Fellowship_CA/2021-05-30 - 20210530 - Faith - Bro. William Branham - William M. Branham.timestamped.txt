[39:46] amen change to sing his praise
[39:50] praise train to acknowledge him train to
[39:52] worship him
[39:53] amen brother that's what he wants and he
[39:56] knows he's not going to get it here
[39:57] completely
[39:58] that's why he promised to take us back
[40:00] amen
[40:02] by the grace of god and i trust we know
[40:05] that we are
[40:05] on our way home i trust we know that
[40:08] we're closer to home
[40:10] than all than any of the others amen
[40:12] brother
[40:13] god did this and they did that god did
[40:15] this they did that
[40:16] but brother god comes down and he puts
[40:19] the fullness of the word
[40:21] in that bride amen so we're not just
[40:24] believing that luther did that's good
[40:26] but we believe as he did but when it
[40:27] comes to what what god asked him to
[40:29] believe
[40:30] amen to give him the faith that please
[40:32] god in that day
[40:33] amen so it please god in wesley's day in
[40:36] the old fashioned salvation army
[40:38] day that pleased god 100 years ago in
[40:40] the pentecostal revival
[40:41] but brother what pleases god today amen
[40:44] brother what pleases god
[40:45] to see in you and me what he's done and
[40:48] what he's doing
[40:49] amen so it's not just again it's not
[40:51] just to start a religion
[40:53] no no it's just it's oh yeah all the
[40:56] other from back they started this they
[40:57] started this they started this faith
[40:59] this
[40:59] this religion and so on but this will
[41:02] come to the hour now in this in these
[41:04] last days
[41:05] that what god has done what god is doing
[41:07] amen
[41:08] is not to start anything is to get away
[41:10] from the starting
[41:12] idea amen because that's time
[41:15] we're going to eternity and god is
[41:17] putting us more and more and more in
[41:20] contact with
[41:21] eternity amen because i don't have a jew
[41:24] but i i'm sick and tired of seeing what
[41:26] i'm seeing out there
[41:27] amen and hearing what i'm hearing out
[41:29] there and because it's all what man has
[41:31] done what man is doing and so on
[41:33] but again like god said to israel and he
[41:36] said he was going to come down and judge
[41:37] israel he said they made many inventions
[41:39] but i'm going to take their inventions
[41:41] away amen is going to destroy their
[41:44] inventions
[41:44] and we put too much emphasis on the
[41:46] inventions of man we want to do this we
[41:48] want to do that
[41:49] look where's our faith amen where is our
[41:52] faith
[41:53] because if we're cut off in faith we
[41:55] won't be caught up in the avengers the
[41:56] inventions of man
[41:58] amen no no we feel oh this is wonderful
[42:00] that's why yeah it is but understand
[42:02] dude
[42:02] it's not god it's the devil amen
[42:06] he he comes with that knowledge in their
[42:08] head but god comes for the revelation in
[42:10] your heart
[42:11] god is not impressed with what you've
[42:13] got in your head god's impressed what's
[42:15] in your heart
[42:16] amen god's not using our heads god not
[42:18] moving there
[42:19] god is moving down here and of course
[42:21] he's got to be down here
[42:22] to control your spirit and he's got to
[42:25] be down here to control
[42:26] what what the devil is trying to
[42:27] influence you in your mind amen
[42:30] remember that's what he's how he started
[42:31] in the garden of eden
[42:33] oh yeah he just too intellectually he
[42:35] remember
[42:36] satan in the in the serpent was the
[42:38] first evangelist
[42:40] he was an evangelist oh yes he was going
[42:43] around seeing what they
[42:44] believed regarding what god did and so
[42:45] on and so oh when he got to eve he knew
[42:48] that he's going to
[42:49] he's going to weaken her weaken her
[42:52] faith challenge her faith
[42:53] and so on so brother i pressed by the
[42:55] grace of god
[42:56] he's not finding that in you and me amen
[42:59] where
[43:00] when it comes to the devil i trust that
[43:02] brother he's he's going to
[43:03] he's going to be recognizing the faith
[43:05] that pleases god
[43:07] in you and in me and again that's why he
[43:10] has come down with great wrath
[43:12] great wrath knowing his time is short so
[43:15] brother
[43:16] i pray grace that we're not going to get
[43:17] caught up with what the devil's doing up
[43:19] there
[43:19] let's get caught up raptured with what
[43:22] god has done
[43:23] and with what god is doing in you and me
[43:26] do god
[43:27] be the glory praise the lord
[43:30] so the lord bless us as we go to the
[43:32] word
[43:33] and just to highlight again that brother
[43:36] tom
[43:37] snow amen we thought he was gone for
[43:40] quite a while now
[43:41] but he's not he's still fighting that's
[43:44] his nature
[43:45] amen when it comes to if he got any idea
[43:48] at all that this is the devil that's the
[43:49] devil get away satan
[43:51] amen and he's by grace through faith in
[43:54] jesus
[43:55] he's endeavoring to conquer the world
[43:57] the flesh and the devil
[43:59] amen so and i remember the
[44:02] like uh he's a real good soldier and uh
[44:05] not sure how long ago it was now that we
[44:07] that our brother claude gale died
[44:10] uh out in deer lake i believe it was at
[44:13] corner brook
[44:15] in corner brook i think it was a
[44:16] hospital there and
[44:19] of course we had the funeral service in
[44:21] the funeral home in deer lake
[44:23] and then we had to drive a couple of
[44:24] hours to to bishop falls to bury brother
[44:27] cloud in the cemetery there
[44:29] and i remember that when we were going
[44:32] through
[44:32] the ceremony of committing the body back
[44:34] to the dust and so
[44:36] on that i noticed brother tom was there
[44:38] oh yes
[44:40] it wasn't his fault if he didn't notice
[44:41] him amen because he was going around
[44:44] and all while we were ministering and
[44:46] even while a pentecostal brother was
[44:48] there with a piano accordion and
[44:50] anyone and he sang a special oh he
[44:52] really appreciated it
[44:53] and of course there was a pentecostal
[44:55] pastor there as well so we thank god for
[44:57] their help
[44:58] but brother brother and tom well praise
[45:01] the lord
[45:02] for him the most important one was jesus
[45:05] amen and so brother tom was going around
[45:08] uh oh my going around all the the people
[45:11] that were in the inside the garden
[45:12] i was just standing outside the garden
[45:14] and he was going around with books
[45:16] message books of the prophet and he was
[45:18] given to give him this one give him that
[45:20] one give that one yeah
[45:22] so i said lord i said bless our brother
[45:24] amen
[45:25] because he was really caught up with the
[45:27] word really oh my
[45:29] he was really zealous with the things of
[45:32] god
[45:32] and i said lord we need we need some of
[45:34] that zealousness
[45:36] in us amen we need something oh yeah
[45:39] thank god for the zeal i heard uh in in
[45:42] the song service
[45:43] it was good praise the lord you don't
[45:45] get that too often
[45:46] and certainly certainly there's not many
[45:48] brother ted's around
[45:51] amen there was one time oh yes
[45:54] and they were singing and shouting and
[45:56] so on but again in this hour goddess but
[45:59] wants wants what he wants us to get the
[46:01] faith that's going to make us sing
[46:03] cause us to sing causes to worship amen
[46:06] and saying i came across just recently
[46:09] on the internet there was i was
[46:10] searching for something else and i came
[46:12] across
[46:13] a certain church and i said who in the
[46:15] world are they
[46:17] and this was absolutely amazing i don't
[46:20] know who they are what they believe
[46:22] but and then they they definitely
[46:24] weren't message believers
[46:25] and so on but oh my they had this uh
[46:29] there was an old man there he was an old
[46:31] preacher
[46:32] and he was and he was just going around
[46:34] you know because he was bowed down
[46:35] because of his age and weak because of
[46:37] his age but he was behind the pulpit and
[46:39] he was agreement
[46:40] the word oh yeah he screamed the word
[46:42] then the then this young
[46:43] young fella took over and it seemed like
[46:46] he was an assistant pastor there
[46:48] oh my and he was running around and he
[46:50] framed and screamed and screamed and
[46:51] screamed
[46:52] and bro yeah but it wasn't just him
[46:54] because it went all through the audience
[46:56] all through the congregation
[46:58] and and you heard this one singing and
[47:00] shouting and dancing
[47:02] oh yeah up and down up and down up and
[47:04] down and then there were
[47:05] then there was even senior citizens
[47:07] there and these these elderly women and
[47:09] elderly
[47:10] brothers there and they were they were
[47:12] oh my not not in the pulpit
[47:14] they were in front of the pope and they
[47:15] just run and run
[47:17] and they run across they run down go
[47:19] across come back
[47:20] all they're going around and around and
[47:22] around the audience
[47:23] i said lord i said who in the world are
[47:26] they
[47:28] amen that's rare that i've seen that
[47:30] even in messy churches rare that i've
[47:32] seen that even in maybe a pentecostal
[47:34] church
[47:35] but they were just so on fire and even
[47:37] young people on the
[47:38] platform they were up and down up and
[47:40] down up and down
[47:41] praising the lord and even the young
[47:43] ones that were doing the organs and
[47:45] pianos
[47:46] well they oh yeah bang bang bang bang
[47:48] bang
[47:49] and yeah and and you could oh yeah and
[47:52] then they would step away
[47:53] and they'd jump up and down amen so it's
[47:56] been true
[47:56] it's tremendous i said oh my look at
[47:58] those senior citizens
[48:00] and some of them very old but i tell you
[48:02] not too old to worship god
[48:04] amen amen not too old to do this and do
[48:07] that
[48:07] and they were numbered with those that
[48:09] were coming up the aisle running in
[48:11] front of the altar
[48:12] going down again and come back and go
[48:14] around and round and round
[48:15] screaming praising the lord and singing
[48:18] amen
[48:20] brother brother chad would feel right at
[48:22] all
[48:24] amen but i think he would stand out as
[48:26] well again because i saw young people
[48:28] there on the platform
[48:29] and well i did maybe 30s and 20s and
[48:32] and they were jumping up and down up and
[48:34] down up and down they're singing a
[48:35] certain song
[48:36] and i said lord who in the world are
[48:38] they and
[48:39] i said lord i pray your grace i said
[48:41] take them out to the truth
[48:43] take them on to the revealed word so
[48:45] brother look up because our redemption
[48:47] draw at nine
[48:48] amen we're not going to please man we'll
[48:51] please god
[48:52] amen sorry brother and if you're born of
[48:54] god you'll be pleased
[48:56] amen so i pray god bless that church no
[48:59] doubt they're gathering somewhere today
[49:00] there's a number of them i think
[49:02] churches in the united states i don't
[49:04] know if there's any here in canada or
[49:05] not
[49:06] but god bless them but like i said don't
[49:09] look down
[49:10] just leave them because if they're not
[49:12] bride they're outside the city
[49:14] oh yeah don't think because when it
[49:16] comes to what god has done
[49:18] and what god is doing in the special
[49:20] word that he brings forth in every age
[49:22] is to separate the bride from the rest
[49:25] because the bride goes into the marriage
[49:27] supper but the others are going to be
[49:29] outside the city
[49:30] and i thank god for that revelation i'll
[49:32] tell you because that's why i
[49:34] like i said i had to preach that what i
[49:35] preached first when i came to the word
[49:37] and it was to try and change their ideas
[49:39] and their attitudes because
[49:41] there was a lot of believers i met and
[49:42] they were just looking down their noses
[49:45] at people out there in in pentecost or
[49:47] salvation army or this church or that
[49:49] church
[49:50] see and and so they they were again i
[49:53] guess calling the
[49:54] them rickeys and richards oh that's all
[49:56] they are they're not believers they're
[49:58] not this they're not that
[49:59] well brother only only the real
[50:02] believers of the message
[50:03] is going for to be part of the bride
[50:06] what about those outside the city
[50:08] amen so we've got to understand what god
[50:11] has done
[50:12] and what is god doing so he's called you
[50:14] but who are you are you going to be in
[50:16] the city or outside the city
[50:18] so brother keep your edges right there
[50:20] goes you but for the grace of god
[50:21] amen oh yeah thank god and brother what
[50:24] i know and what you know
[50:26] and the revelation that god has given us
[50:28] is all grace
[50:30] amen it's grace and brother if we
[50:32] recognize anything it is grace
[50:34] because we gotta recognize that grace to
[50:37] get the faith
[50:38] it is by grace through faith amen
[50:41] praise the lord it is grace projecting
[50:44] divine love
[50:45] and divine love giving us the result of
[50:47] the faith that we need
[50:48] amen should you have the faith you need
[50:51] i just say oh yeah i agree with i agree
[50:53] with the preacher yeah
[50:54] i got that faith he says what i what i
[50:56] believe he says to when i agree with it
[50:58] no his brother it's got more than that
[50:59] it's believing jesus amen
[51:01] and believing that jesus is here
[51:04] amen amen it wasn't william branham it
[51:07] was jesus
[51:09] they probably said you don't understand
[51:11] that he said you don't
[51:12] he said you're not getting it and again
[51:14] one place is not
[51:15] he said it's not striking me right and
[51:18] he said i know it's not striking you
[51:19] right
[51:19] amen well because what god the faith
[51:22] that god gave what is god going to
[51:24] accomplish with that faith
[51:26] brother are we getting more and more
[51:28] rapture conscious
[51:30] or just conscious of doctrines no no i
[51:32] trust by grace it's the rapture
[51:36] because god showed luther this and this
[51:38] and this concerning a lot of teachings
[51:39] in the catholic church
[51:41] and it was false false false false but
[51:43] then god got him to the revelation of
[51:45] justification
[51:46] amen not do this and do this do this god
[51:49] i want you to believe
[51:50] this god wants you to believe his word
[51:52] believe see
[51:53] when even when when martha was
[51:57] at the tomb there and he said he's going
[51:59] to rise again
[52:00] believe us thou this amen
[52:04] she believed that and believe that and
[52:05] believe that the past and oh
[52:07] god's going to do this but he said i am
[52:09] the resurrection
[52:10] not i will be i am and he said he said
[52:13] believe us now this that lazarus will
[52:15] come for.
[52:16] oh she said i believe you'll come forth
[52:18] in the resurrection oh he said i am the
[52:20] resurrection that's right
[52:21] amen the resurrection was not there the
[52:23] resurrection was stood there talking to
[52:25] her
[52:25] amen amen and the rapture and the change
[52:28] and being cut away
[52:29] with the with the in the marriage supper
[52:31] of the lamb oh brother
[52:33] it's it's not just an idea well that's
[52:34] up there no we're getting into it now
[52:37] amen remember again they're in the book
[52:39] of luke and it says go forth and call
[52:41] these
[52:42] to the marriage supper and oh no they
[52:44] made this excuse and that excuse
[52:46] and brother that's the problem even
[52:48] believers are making excuses why they
[52:50] don't go to church
[52:51] yeah uh no brother if god is in you
[52:54] you're hungry and thirst for it amen
[52:56] amen most definitely should the grace of
[52:58] god be with us
[52:59] as we will this morning go into a
[53:02] ministry of the message by brother
[53:04] branham and it is
[53:06] it is called faith pay
[53:09] i got about 14 or 15 sermons in there
[53:12] booklets
[53:13] faith that he preached the number of
[53:16] times

[53:38] oh god preached this and god and the
[53:40] and the prophet preached this and the
[53:41] prophet preached that that's good but

[53:46] to your heart not your head
[53:48] too many got the revelation in their
[53:49] heads but not in the heart

[53:55] souls in our hearts is god in control
[53:58] amen and whatever you do it's not you
[54:02] it's god amen whatever you do when you
[54:06] see

[56:50] if you don't hear him it's not his fault
[56:52] amen so god's grace be with you our
[56:54] brother chad and family
[56:56] amen in saint mary's gospel and chapter
[56:58] 11
[57:01] and verse start with verse 11.
[57:06] and jesus entered into jerusalem and
[57:09] into
[57:10] the temple and when he had looked around
[57:13] about
[57:13] all things and now the even tide was
[57:16] come
[57:17] he went out onto bethany with the twelve
[57:21] and on the morrow when they were come
[57:23] from bethany he was hungry
[57:26] and seeing a fig tree far off having
[57:29] leaves
[57:30] he came if aptly he might find anything
[57:33] thereon
[57:34] and when he came to it he found nothing
[57:37] but leaves for the time of the
[57:41] of figs was not yet and jesus
[57:44] answered and said unto it no man
[57:47] eat fruit of thee hereafter forever
[57:51] and his disciples heard it amen
[57:56] and they came to jerusalem and went and
[57:59] jesus went into the temple
[58:01] and began to cast out them that sold
[58:04] and bought in the temple and overthrew
[58:07] the tables of the money
[58:09] changers brother we use
[58:12] the temple for the grace of god the
[58:14] glory of god
[58:15] amen and it says over through the tables
[58:19] of the money changers
[58:20] and the seats of them that sold dogs
[58:23] and remembering when we were in our trip
[58:25] to israel
[58:26] and we were being driven around a
[58:28] certain area and we passed down a
[58:29] certain street
[58:30] and there was renovating there's
[58:33] something going on in another building
[58:35] there
[58:35] and our and our jewish tour guide said
[58:39] oh he said see that he said that's where
[58:42] jesus cast them out he said many years
[58:44] ago
[58:45] he said at the temple because they're
[58:46] making your jews using the temple to
[58:48] make money
[58:49] and he said i'll be honest he said jesus
[58:51] needs to do it again
[58:53] he said cast them out amen so he he was
[58:56] a
[58:57] he was a jewish tour guide
[59:00] but again he really he really respected
[59:03] us and even thanked us for our
[59:05] prayers for him amen because god
[59:08] delivered him from a habit that he was
[59:10] in
[59:10] and of course that brother now is i
[59:12] guess in his 80s but i still
[59:14] occasionally get
[59:15] emails from him amen he's still on the
[59:17] go praise the lord
[59:19] and they come to jerusalem and jesus
[59:22] went into the temple and began to cast
[59:24] out them
[59:25] that sold and bought in the temple
[59:29] and over through the tables of the money
[59:31] changers
[59:32] and the seats of them that sold
[59:36] doves amen we're not here to sell it
[59:39] you're to give it
[59:40] amen and would not suffer that any man
[59:43] should carry
[59:44] any vessel through the temple and he
[59:47] taught saying unto them
[59:49] is it not written my house shall be
[59:52] called of all nations
[59:54] the house of prayer but ye have made it
[59:57] a den of thieves amen
[1:00:00] and the scribes and the chief priests
[1:00:02] heard it and sought
[1:00:04] out they might destroy him for they
[1:00:06] feared him
[1:00:07] because all the people were astonished
[1:00:10] at his doctrine
[1:00:11] and when even was come he went out of
[1:00:14] the city
[1:00:15] and in the morning as they passed by
[1:00:18] they saw the fig tree
[1:00:19] dried up from the roots
[1:00:23] amen and peter calling to remembrance
[1:00:26] saith unto him
[1:00:27] master behold the fig tree which thou
[1:00:29] cursed
[1:00:30] is withered away and jesus answering
[1:00:33] saith unto them
[1:00:34] have faith in god amen
[1:00:38] speak it and believe that god is going
[1:00:40] to do it amen
[1:00:43] and also turn with me to rev to hebrews
[1:00:45] rather the book of hebrews chapter 11.
[1:00:51] hebrews chapter 11 praise the lord
[1:00:56] and again beginning to read at verse 1.
[1:01:01] now he said faith is the substance
[1:01:04] of things hoped for the evidence
[1:01:08] of things not seen amen what you're
[1:01:11] hoping for
[1:01:12] and what you what you're not seeing with
[1:01:14] your natural eyes
[1:01:16] you see by faith amen
[1:01:20] because faith reveals it in our hearts
[1:01:24] and brother something that struck me in
[1:01:26] some study again this week
[1:01:28] past week was was the faith in the old
[1:01:31] testament
[1:01:33] because noah moses adam
[1:01:37] they all live by faith abraham uh isaac
[1:01:40] jacob they're all live by faith you talk
[1:01:43] about it go go read the bible
[1:01:44] and brother no matter what happened god
[1:01:46] was in control
[1:01:48] amen god told them do this do this do
[1:01:50] this and they did it
[1:01:52] amen they were controlled soul body and

[1:04:33] theophany body
[1:04:34] praise the name of the lord amen god
[1:04:37] help us to believe it
[1:04:39] but as i said i've been in my mind in my
[1:04:42] heart for quite a while
[1:04:44] just thinking i said lord what's heaven
[1:04:45] going to be this heaven's going to be
[1:04:46] tremendous
[1:04:48] new heaven and new earth is going to be
[1:04:49] tremendous i said we're going to walk on
[1:04:51] this earth
[1:04:52] and there's no thoughts of sin there's
[1:04:53] nothing nothing nothing
[1:04:55] negative everything is positive
[1:04:58] amen oh yeah god's
[1:05:02] why because i tell you well what redeems
[1:05:04] us
[1:05:05] oh well how are we going to appreciate
[1:05:06] god and so on well we have faith in god
[1:05:09] because of
[1:05:09] what god has done why he has done it
[1:05:12] when we get there but when
[1:05:13] we're going to manifest it okay we're
[1:05:15] going to live the life
[1:05:16] that he that he purchased for us at
[1:05:18] calvary amen
[1:05:20] and brother we don't want to remember
[1:05:22] this remember that remember
[1:05:23] no by the grace of god amen
[1:05:27] we're going to be so grateful for
[1:05:29] thankful because of the atmosphere
[1:05:31] and everything is positive nothing
[1:05:34] negative you know and we're not going to
[1:05:36] remember the sin
[1:05:37] and all that because god don't even
[1:05:40] remember it
[1:05:40] it's cast into the sea of forgetfulness
[1:05:43] and people think when we get to heaven
[1:05:45] we're going to
[1:05:45] we're still going to remember this
[1:05:47] remember this we're going to remember
[1:05:48] this one or that one
[1:05:50] well no not by any means
[1:05:53] it's like again there's a number of
[1:05:55] young people that went beyond the
[1:05:56] curtain of time
[1:05:57] and they met family there but they
[1:05:58] didn't know who they were
[1:06:00] and you don't know me no
[1:06:04] i i'm your sister but again remember
[1:06:07] that's only been
[1:06:08] revealed to them in that way so as to
[1:06:11] give them an understanding when they
[1:06:13] come back amen
[1:06:15] because when we when we get out of here
[1:06:17] forget it
[1:06:19] this would be the name of the lord
[1:06:21] because again
[1:06:22] oh yeah you're only going to remember
[1:06:24] your wife your wife's going to remember
[1:06:25] you
[1:06:26] the husband and so on well yeah if it's
[1:06:28] the will of god if that's the right mate
[1:06:30] but if you don't get the right mate here
[1:06:31] you've got you're going to get in there
[1:06:33] by the grace of god amen because john
[1:06:37] john wesley he was one of the messengers
[1:06:39] that we could highlight
[1:06:40] and say he didn't get the right mate
[1:06:41] here he didn't
[1:06:43] no no in fact after he was into the
[1:06:47] ministry still so long
[1:06:50] he had to separate himself from her oh
[1:06:52] yeah
[1:06:53] brother again if again trusting you just
[1:06:56] trust and leave that with the lord
[1:06:58] amen amen god allowed it for a reason
[1:07:01] so we're going to have because there's
[1:07:03] again there's people asking the
[1:07:04] questions recently
[1:07:05] or will we recognize everybody in in in
[1:07:08] in glory we recognize this one this one
[1:07:11] recognize them you will have a
[1:07:12] revelation that dear your brothers and
[1:07:14] sisters in christ
[1:07:15] amen you have a revelation that oh that
[1:07:18] yes you're the bride
[1:07:19] they're the bride amen by the grace of
[1:07:21] god
[1:07:22] but again no brother people think we're
[1:07:25] going to remember this and that brother
[1:07:27] to
[1:07:27] do that we'd have to remember sin yeah
[1:07:31] and there's not going to be any thoughts
[1:07:32] of sin anything to look at nothing
[1:07:35] sinful
[1:07:36] it's all righteous by the grace of god
[1:07:40] amen
[1:07:42] god give us that faith let's see god
[1:07:45] what is it doing it's creating us a
[1:07:46] hunger and thirst
[1:07:48] we can't we can't take any longer and
[1:07:51] that's why like jesus like i said jesus
[1:07:52] said
[1:07:53] how much longer shall i be with you why
[1:07:56] he wanted to get out
[1:07:58] he couldn't take it no longer grace
[1:08:01] how much longer will we be here lord
[1:08:06] grace to get us out well the grace is
[1:08:09] the grace is giving us the faith to take
[1:08:11] us out
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:18] and it says through faith we understand
[1:08:20] that the worlds were framed
[1:08:22] by the word of god so that things which
[1:08:26] are
[1:08:26] seen were not made of things which do
[1:08:28] appear
[1:08:29] amen praise the lord by faith abel
[1:08:33] offered unto god
[1:08:35] a more excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:08:39] and just think as i preached years ago
[1:08:43] in empire avenue church and we had a
[1:08:46] visitor there
[1:08:48] that just dropped in and
[1:08:51] he appreciated it oh he said brother he
[1:08:53] said i never heard that before he said
[1:08:54] but you're right you're right i said
[1:08:57] which church would you go to
[1:09:00] i said would you go to abel's church or
[1:09:01] would you go to keynes
[1:09:04] and i was explaining in the sermon well
[1:09:07] if you went to abel's church this is
[1:09:08] what you're going to see
[1:09:09] and you went to king's church oh it was
[1:09:10] beautiful oh my
[1:09:12] he had it all there on the altar all the
[1:09:14] everything that he had grown
[1:09:15] in his yard oh my god given this to the
[1:09:18] lord given it to the lord and
[1:09:20] i said oh yeah but if we don't go to
[1:09:22] cain's
[1:09:23] abel's church no it's not a church of
[1:09:25] them
[1:09:27] i mean with blood blood here blood there
[1:09:30] and blood on abel
[1:09:32] that's god's church yeah it was god's
[1:09:33] church amen
[1:09:35] so i said which one would you go to and
[1:09:37] he said you're right brother
[1:09:38] you're right because he spoke to me
[1:09:40] after the sermon
[1:09:41] after the service and so on god rest
[1:09:44] god bless him and maybe rest his soul by
[1:09:47] the grace of god
[1:09:48] amen because i tell you
[1:09:51] god when it comes to god he don't reveal
[1:09:53] to him he's not revealing himself to us
[1:09:54] in our heads
[1:09:55] nobody in our hearts and through his
[1:09:58] word
[1:09:58] amen so god help us that we'll believe
[1:10:01] god we'll offer the sacrifice
[1:10:04] the right sacrifice as abel did
[1:10:07] not thank us it's got to be beautiful
[1:10:09] it's got to be this it's got to be that
[1:10:10] no
[1:10:12] amen we're coming forth in the name of
[1:10:15] our lord jesus christ
[1:10:17] amen and it says by faith abel offered
[1:10:20] unto god a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:10:22] cain
[1:10:23] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:10:27] righteous amen so are you righteous
[1:10:31] you if you are you will offer the right
[1:10:33] sacrifice
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:39] and it says he was righteous god
[1:10:40] testifying of his gifts
[1:10:42] and by hit he being dead yet
[1:10:45] speaketh praise the lord amen
[1:10:49] your faith goes on and on and on one
[1:10:51] generation to another
[1:10:54] so by faith enoch was translated that
[1:10:58] he should not see death
[1:11:01] and was not found because god had
[1:11:04] translated him
[1:11:05] for before his translation he had this
[1:11:07] testimony
[1:11:08] that he pleased god amen
[1:11:13] do you have that testimony
[1:11:17] that you please god oh well i believe
[1:11:19] the message
[1:11:20] what but do you believe it in the way
[1:11:22] that god wants you to believe it
[1:11:24] amen because again like i said he told
[1:11:27] his own church
[1:11:28] the message is it you know you're in the
[1:11:30] message but the message is not
[1:11:32] in you amen
[1:11:35] in in the heart oh yeah god help us
[1:11:39] why because how do god know it because
[1:11:41] you're not living the life of faith
[1:11:44] that the message will if it's in your
[1:11:46] heart
[1:11:47] if it's in your heart it controls you
[1:11:50] soul body
[1:11:51] spirit amen controls your spirit
[1:11:54] controls your soul
[1:11:55] amen controlling you even your body by
[1:11:57] the grace of god
[1:11:58] amen grace to us
[1:12:02] amen that we have the faith giving jesus
[1:12:05] control
[1:12:07] that's why it's not you that lives it's
[1:12:10] jesus living in you
[1:12:12] amen praise the lord and brother
[1:12:17] he raptured some of the saints back then
[1:12:19] he resurrected them and raptured them
[1:12:22] so brother now he's with us and then us
[1:12:24] what do what's he doing
[1:12:26] he's resurrecting us you know out of
[1:12:29] dead denominationalism
[1:12:30] amen oh yeah he's resurrecting us and
[1:12:33] he's and what's he doing he's rapturing
[1:12:34] us getting us caught up
[1:12:36] by the grace of god amen god help us
[1:12:39] that we're not just in religion no no
[1:12:42] it's the word of god in us and again as
[1:12:45] the prophet of god did say he says not
[1:12:47] striking me the way it should
[1:12:49] not striking you the way it should amen
[1:12:51] but there's going to rise a generation
[1:12:53] and it would strike them the way it
[1:12:54] should praise the lord
[1:12:56] grace so he said without faith
[1:13:00] it is impossible to please him
[1:13:04] do you please him not your emotions
[1:13:08] not your feelings it's your faith amen
[1:13:12] does do you please god in what you do
[1:13:15] what you don't do do you please god and
[1:13:17] in in in the witness that you give and
[1:13:20] how you give it and so on
[1:13:23] is god in control of you morning noon
[1:13:26] and night amen if god's in control
[1:13:30] there's not
[1:13:30] you i tell you you can't do this do this
[1:13:32] go here go there
[1:13:33] without talking to him oh yeah you talk
[1:13:36] to him every day
[1:13:38] you talk to him when you're when you're
[1:13:39] when you're driving your vehicle you can
[1:13:41] talk to jesus when you're when you're
[1:13:42] going and do this go and do that even if
[1:13:44] you're at work
[1:13:45] oh yeah oh i'm doing this i'm doing that
[1:13:47] well i'll tell you you'll never forget
[1:13:49] jesus
[1:13:50] because if you've got to make a decision
[1:13:51] i got to do this oh lord
[1:13:53] i need your help yeah
[1:13:56] where'd that come from it was a
[1:13:58] conviction in your heart
[1:14:00] and jesus is waiting for you to say it
[1:14:02] the manifestation of your faith
[1:14:05] no matter what it what goes on in your
[1:14:06] life if you've got faith
[1:14:08] you won't leave him out of it lord we
[1:14:10] need your leadership
[1:14:11] lord what should i do lord what should i
[1:14:13] say
[1:14:15] help me lord or if something happens and
[1:14:17] then this happens and oh
[1:14:18] it's and it's real good to you say thank
[1:14:20] you jesus
[1:14:22] you can't if you're a christian if
[1:14:25] you're born again
[1:14:27] you've got his nature in you and he's
[1:14:30] there all the time to talk to you
[1:14:32] yeah god help us oh no no
[1:14:36] i gotta be praying to talk to him no no
[1:14:38] you walk talk to jesus

[1:14:42] work oh thank you lord

[1:14:48] thank you lord today
[1:14:50] how many times you say thank you lord in
[1:14:52] a day
[1:14:54] yeah because you know i can't do nothing
[1:14:56] without him
[1:14:58] but with him all things are possible
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:02] that's all such as the relationship
[1:15:04] between us
[1:15:05] and jesus no wonder he's putting the
[1:15:07] emphasis on faith
[1:15:10] amen because it brings into a
[1:15:12] relationship with him
[1:15:14] and it maintains that relationship
[1:15:16] morning noon night
[1:15:17] every second of the day amen god
[1:15:20] just think would you do this that the
[1:15:23] prophet did
[1:15:24] when he as i mentioned before when
[1:15:27] brother billy paul
[1:15:28] went to get to brother branham and to
[1:15:31] say
[1:15:31] brother uh you're you're waiting for you
[1:15:34] at the pulpit
[1:15:36] and when he did brother brown was in in
[1:15:38] the room
[1:15:39] on his knees in prayer and he was saying
[1:15:43] lord oh i'm sorry lord i didn't mean
[1:15:47] you i don't mean he said to interrupt
[1:15:48] you because he knew there was others
[1:15:51] praying
[1:15:52] yeah oh yeah he was apologizing yeah he
[1:15:55] apologized to the lord
[1:15:58] amen do you apologize to god are you
[1:16:01] are you hungry for god thirsty for god
[1:16:04] in his presence do you have that kind of
[1:16:06] relationship
[1:16:07] that well oh praise the lord i'm born
[1:16:09] again now
[1:16:10] i'm not not all conscious of this this
[1:16:12] this person or that person unconscious
[1:16:13] of jesus
[1:16:15] amen to be with you even in you to the
[1:16:17] end of the age
[1:16:18] he said i'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:16:20] you
[1:16:23] and there's i pray grace that we're not
[1:16:25] ignorant of his presence
[1:16:26] not ignorant of his anointing amen he's
[1:16:29] with you
[1:16:32] amen verse 6
[1:16:34] again said but without faith it is
[1:16:37] impossible
[1:16:38] actually impossible to please god with
[1:16:41] opi
[1:16:43] amen for he that cometh to god must
[1:16:47] believe that
[1:16:48] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:16:51] that
[1:16:52] diligently seek him brother if you're
[1:16:54] going to diligently see god you can't
[1:16:56] forget him
[1:16:57] amen you can't get him out of your mind
[1:16:59] out of your way god's grace to us
[1:17:01] brother
[1:17:02] is my prayer amen let's stand
[1:17:08] stand and we'll sing only believe and go
[1:17:10] to the prophet
[1:17:13] and the message again is preached in
[1:17:17] 1957
[1:17:18] and it is faith amen he's preaching on
[1:17:22] faith amen so god help us
[1:17:26] that we're going to receive the message
[1:17:27] believe them oh yes also
[1:17:29] i want you to remember in prayer
[1:17:32] [Music]

[1:25:13] an hour
[1:25:14] amen so god bless us you may be seated
[1:25:17] faith
[1:25:23] praise the lord
[1:25:30] amen right on just a few remarks
[1:25:33] from god's eternal and blessed word
[1:25:38] and i would like to read just a portion
[1:25:40] of it here found
[1:25:42] in the book of saint mark and the 11th
[1:25:45] chapter of saint mark
[1:25:48] i want to talk on faith just for a few
[1:25:50] moments cause many of you standing your
[1:25:52] limbs will be cramping
[1:25:55] i want to begin at the 20th verse
[1:25:59] i want to read it from the original
[1:26:02] greek lexan and in the morning
[1:26:06] as they pass by they saw the fig tree
[1:26:09] dried up from the roots
[1:26:11] and peter calling to remembrance said
[1:26:14] unto him
[1:26:15] master behold the fig tree which thou
[1:26:18] did curse is withered away
[1:26:22] jesus answering said unto them have
[1:26:26] faith in god amen for verily i
[1:26:29] say unto you that whosoever shall say
[1:26:33] unto this mountain be removed and cast
[1:26:35] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[1:26:39] heart
[1:26:40] but believe that those things which he
[1:26:43] saith
[1:26:44] is coming to pass he shall have
[1:26:48] whatsoever he
[1:26:49] saith amen what a blessed promise
[1:26:53] amen faith in god
[1:26:58] it's a staggering thing to many people
[1:27:02] and yet we ought to be ashamed of
[1:27:04] ourselves
[1:27:06] to confess that we don't have faith in
[1:27:09] god first
[1:27:12] there is cowards who
[1:27:15] died ten deaths
[1:27:19] while they're here on earth and a hero
[1:27:22] never dies
[1:27:24] his memories linger on for his great
[1:27:27] heroic deeds
[1:27:29] and usually people who have faith
[1:27:33] are people who have experience
[1:27:36] experience brings faith
[1:27:41] i think that's the reason that the bible
[1:27:44] teaches
[1:27:45] us jesus said in saint john the third
[1:27:48] chapter
[1:27:50] except the man be born again
[1:27:53] he cannot understand the kingdom of god
[1:27:58] now that's quoting from the original in
[1:28:00] the the king james it said he cannot
[1:28:02] see but the word doesn't mean see like
[1:28:06] you look with your eyes
[1:28:07] it means to understand you can't see the
[1:28:11] kingdom
[1:28:12] anyhow you must understand it and jesus
[1:28:16] said
[1:28:16] except the man be born again first
[1:28:20] he'll cannot understand the kingdom of
[1:28:23] god
[1:28:24] so it's uh it behooves us to have an
[1:28:28] experience
[1:28:29] before faith can ever accomplish very
[1:28:32] much
[1:28:33] therefore people ought to be saved
[1:28:36] before
[1:28:37] first they come to god and have an
[1:28:38] experience of salvation before they
[1:28:41] approach
[1:28:42] god for their healing it must
[1:28:45] it'll it'll work wonders if you can only
[1:28:49] believe it
[1:28:50] now notice many
[1:28:53] times in the scriptures we take the
[1:28:56] famous
[1:28:57] old scenes of israel when they were in
[1:29:00] trouble and
[1:29:01] there was a war broke out between israel
[1:29:04] and the philistines
[1:29:06] and israel had gathered themselves over
[1:29:09] on the side
[1:29:10] of the hill and the battle was set in
[1:29:13] order but
[1:29:14] no man was able to go to battle
[1:29:19] because over on the other side of the
[1:29:21] hill
[1:29:22] the enemy had a great challenger
[1:29:27] and as it was then so is it
[1:29:30] now that when god's
[1:29:33] people starts to go to do something
[1:29:36] the enemy always has a challenger
[1:29:41] challenging for and this
[1:29:44] great almost prehistoric
[1:29:47] giant stood there with 14 inch
[1:29:50] fingers on him and a
[1:29:53] spear in his hand the size of a weaver's
[1:29:57] needle he challenged any man of
[1:30:01] israel to come and fight with him that's
[1:30:04] the way the enemy does
[1:30:06] when he thinks he has the upper hand
[1:30:11] he'll never do it when he sees
[1:30:14] conquering faith
[1:30:16] but he'll only do it when he knows he's
[1:30:19] got you cowed
[1:30:20] down amen that's when the church can't
[1:30:24] move it's when he's got the weaver's
[1:30:27] needle over you
[1:30:29] but while in the
[1:30:33] armies of the israelites saul
[1:30:36] the great warrior if there was
[1:30:40] any man in the whole army
[1:30:43] that was more apt to be able to go
[1:30:47] and fight with this giant with saul
[1:30:51] first he was a well-trained
[1:30:54] wire he knowed all the maneuvers
[1:30:59] how to dodge the spears and how to
[1:31:02] knock them off with his shield
[1:31:05] and above that he was head and shoulders
[1:31:09] above
[1:31:09] any man in his arm he was more
[1:31:13] physically for a match and
[1:31:16] he was a traitor of man
[1:31:21] but as it was with saul in those days we
[1:31:24] find the same thing existing today
[1:31:27] among people who go to church
[1:31:31] some of them who are the best trained
[1:31:33] scholars
[1:31:34] has the least faith in god sometimes
[1:31:39] has the phds and deities
[1:31:42] and try to explain it or try to get away
[1:31:47] from the very
[1:31:48] fact of facing god's word they try to
[1:31:51] explain it away
[1:31:52] some other way
[1:31:55] and it's truth all of our
[1:31:58] scholarship all of our training
[1:32:02] never puts us in position to meet the
[1:32:05] enemy
[1:32:07] it takes faith in god to do that
[1:32:10] and that alone
[1:32:13] but if we notice while this giant was
[1:32:17] making his great boast and this great
[1:32:20] theologian as
[1:32:21] it would be stand there well trained you
[1:32:23] know
[1:32:24] how to fight but he had never had any
[1:32:27] experience with
[1:32:28] god amen such a pity today
[1:32:33] to see men and women who've
[1:32:36] lived in church been brought up
[1:32:40] in this crater road and
[1:32:43] knows the bible well but yet has
[1:32:47] never witnessed an experience with god
[1:32:50] what we need is to get back to a real
[1:32:54] heartfelt experience to know who you got
[1:32:59] faith in not some writings
[1:33:02] but the true and the living god
[1:33:08] and there in the midst of death
[1:33:12] way back over behind the fields
[1:33:18] god had a little ready boy
[1:33:21] by the name of david
[1:33:24] he tended his taller father's sheep
[1:33:29] and while he was tending his sheep he
[1:33:32] got some experience
[1:33:35] and it was his father who sent him up to
[1:33:38] the
[1:33:39] armies to take his brothers some
[1:33:42] fig cakes and raisin cakes
[1:33:45] and while he was up there he saw this
[1:33:48] great
[1:33:49] giant come out and make this
[1:33:52] big wide boast
[1:33:55] now little david was no match at all
[1:34:00] first he was just a young fella
[1:34:03] and the next thing he was a ready fella
[1:34:06] which means he was a little rough as we
[1:34:09] would call it
[1:34:11] and he was no match at all
[1:34:14] he never had a sword in his hand
[1:34:18] perhaps he never picked up a shield in
[1:34:20] his life
[1:34:21] he knows nothing about military training
[1:34:26] but there's one thing he didn't know
[1:34:29] he know his god amen
[1:34:33] that's the main thing he
[1:34:36] knew he had believed praise
[1:34:40] god and so when the giant made his
[1:34:43] challenge
[1:34:44] david knew another thing what was right
[1:34:47] and wrong sometimes we who go to church
[1:34:53] doesn't seem to hardly have the
[1:34:56] spiritual intelligence to know the
[1:34:58] difference
[1:34:59] if we do we don't act any different
[1:35:03] but he knew what was right and what was
[1:35:06] wrong
[1:35:07] he knew it was wrong for that philistine
[1:35:11] to defy the armies of the living god
[1:35:14] so he said these words do you
[1:35:18] mean to tell me that you let
[1:35:21] that uncircumcised philistine stand
[1:35:24] there
[1:35:25] and defy the armies of the living god
[1:35:30] what a rebuke to a
[1:35:33] trained army
[1:35:36] what a rebuke it is today for some
[1:35:39] little wash woman maybe that doesn't
[1:35:42] know her abc's
[1:35:45] but can stand in the face of a
[1:35:47] well-trained clergyman
[1:35:49] who's saying the days of miracles are
[1:35:51] past and define that word
[1:35:53] by saying i was once crippled or sick
[1:35:56] and now i'm healed amen amen she might
[1:35:59] not know
[1:36:00] all the ins and out of theology but she
[1:36:03] knows
[1:36:03] god after all that's what's required
[1:36:10] and there this little ruddy david
[1:36:13] just the youth with this little sheep
[1:36:15] coat wrapped around him
[1:36:18] walked up into the face of those towels
[1:36:21] and made them ashamed of themselves
[1:36:24] it said you stand there the trained army
[1:36:28] of the living god
[1:36:30] and let that philistine defy the armies
[1:36:34] of god
[1:36:34] amen said i will go fight himself myself
[1:36:38] oh i love that courageous
[1:36:41] spirit in david
[1:36:44] and saul tried to educate him and put
[1:36:47] him on a
[1:36:48] ecclesiastical jacket but it didn't feed
[1:36:50] him he said take
[1:36:52] this thing off of me i don't know how to
[1:36:55] say ah
[1:36:56] man the way you do i neither do i know
[1:36:59] your theology
[1:37:01] let me go with that what i've had
[1:37:05] experienced by
[1:37:07] oh a fellow said to me some time ago
[1:37:10] he said brother brown your preaching is
[1:37:12] in vain for there's no such a thing as
[1:37:14] divine healing
[1:37:16] i said this is one thing brother you
[1:37:19] just haven't been where we've walked
[1:37:22] that's all
[1:37:24] or you're just too late to tell us now
[1:37:27] we've already found it and witnessed it
[1:37:31] around the world the great revival
[1:37:35] of the outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:37:38] to bring forth signs and wonders to
[1:37:40] fulfill
[1:37:41] the word of god in these last days
[1:37:45] and this little fella took these old
[1:37:48] uh degrees off of him walked out there
[1:37:52] and he said lookie here
[1:37:54] here's why i'm going out i know who i
[1:37:58] have believed
[1:38:00] saul know nothing about that though he
[1:38:02] went to church every
[1:38:03] sabbath and he might have done all the
[1:38:06] religious things that the rest of them
[1:38:08] done
[1:38:09] but he had never had an experience
[1:38:13] and what happened david said when i was
[1:38:17] handing my father's sheep out there when
[1:38:21] i
[1:38:21] walked down to the green pastures and by
[1:38:25] the still waters
[1:38:27] hallelujah i learned of a god
[1:38:30] who made the heavens and earth and i was
[1:38:33] responsible for my
[1:38:35] papa's few sheep and a bear running and
[1:38:38] grabbed one and i saw him
[1:38:41] and a lion running and grabbed the kid
[1:38:43] and took off and i knocked him down with
[1:38:45] my slingshot
[1:38:46] and when he raised up i grabbed him by
[1:38:48] the beard and slew him
[1:38:50] he said the god that delivered the
[1:38:53] bearing
[1:38:54] how much more will he deliver that
[1:38:56] uncircumcised listening
[1:38:58] into my hands certainly
[1:39:02] he knew what he was talking about
[1:39:05] he had faith in god
[1:39:08] he had an experience to see what god
[1:39:10] would do
[1:39:11] therefore he knowed that experience
[1:39:13] would carry him on to victory
[1:39:16] oh years later when he become the king
[1:39:20] of
[1:39:20] israel there's no doubt that he become
[1:39:22] king
[1:39:23] for such a warrior as that amen when he
[1:39:26] become
[1:39:27] king he had an idea let me build the
[1:39:29] house of the lord
[1:39:31] and when the prophet nathan that night
[1:39:34] took him out
[1:39:35] i was talking to him the lord appeared
[1:39:38] to nathan
[1:39:39] he said go tell my servant david
[1:39:42] i know he was just a little ruddy thing
[1:39:45] i know he's wearing a sheep coat
[1:39:47] but i took him away from that sheep coat
[1:39:50] and
[1:39:50] made him a ruler over by people
[1:39:54] and give him a name like the great man
[1:39:56] in this earth
[1:39:57] how god seen that sincerity of faith to
[1:40:01] believing
[1:40:02] upon an experience that he was the
[1:40:05] living god
[1:40:08] how little it was for abraham after he
[1:40:11] had
[1:40:12] endured us seeing him who was invisible
[1:40:16] how after he met god and had an
[1:40:20] experience of
[1:40:22] talking face to face with god that he
[1:40:25] could call those things which were not
[1:40:27] as though they were for he had an
[1:40:30] experience
[1:40:31] he had talked to god face to face
[1:40:36] that's what we need it's a personal
[1:40:39] experience with the living god
[1:40:43] how that moses after having
[1:40:47] 40 years of religious training by his
[1:40:49] mother
[1:40:51] how having 40 years of military
[1:40:54] might in his hands of how to whip a
[1:40:57] nation
[1:40:59] how to conquer and it's taken
[1:41:02] god 40 years to take it out of him
[1:41:06] but once out there in the wilderness
[1:41:09] alone
[1:41:11] one day he'd come face to face with god
[1:41:14] in a burning bush
[1:41:18] and he was better equipped than five
[1:41:20] minutes after he had talked with god in
[1:41:22] eighty years had done anything to him
[1:41:27] he was a coward dying a thousand deaths
[1:41:31] and after meeting god he wished he had a
[1:41:33] thousand lives to die for christ
[1:41:37] he was ready to go there was nothing
[1:41:40] could stop him
[1:41:41] though he had no army though his
[1:41:43] education was no good to him
[1:41:47] he couldn't fight he had no swords
[1:41:51] he didn't have any wires any chariots to
[1:41:54] back him up
[1:41:55] as far as the world knew but he'd come
[1:41:58] face to face with god with an experience
[1:42:01] you had the armored angels of
[1:42:03] all the eternities just stand behind him
[1:42:06] as moses went his way down with his wife
[1:42:10] straddle of a little mew
[1:42:12] and a long whiskers hanging down i
[1:42:14] believe that
[1:42:15] ten thousand times ten thousands of
[1:42:18] angels
[1:42:19] rolled along down those roads with him
[1:42:23] he had an experience
[1:42:26] it was down at dawson one time
[1:42:31] when a young fellow a
[1:42:34] prophet's servant
[1:42:37] and he went down with him to dolphin
[1:42:41] and while the prophet slept the great
[1:42:44] syrian army come and and compas
[1:42:48] encamped about the great walls of
[1:42:51] gotham and when he woke up the next
[1:42:54] morning he had never had an experience
[1:42:56] he said to as he seen the great army
[1:42:59] looking for elijah
[1:43:01] he said oh my father
[1:43:04] the whole armies have gathered and
[1:43:07] surrounded here
[1:43:08] they're looking for you it didn't shake
[1:43:12] that old prophet
[1:43:15] praise god it might have been cancer it
[1:43:17] might have been tuberculosis
[1:43:19] it might have been a stroke but it
[1:43:21] didn't shake that
[1:43:23] prophet amen he looked at him and he
[1:43:25] said son
[1:43:27] there is more with us than there is with
[1:43:29] them
[1:43:30] amen he said i can only see you and i
[1:43:34] he said open his eyes god that he can
[1:43:38] see give him an experience
[1:43:42] and when his eyes open he looked in the
[1:43:44] home mountains was full of chariots and
[1:43:46] fire and horses of fire
[1:43:49] around that old shannon prophet he had
[1:43:52] an experience there was no more doubt in
[1:43:54] his mind
[1:43:55] than it was samson with a jawbone of a
[1:43:59] mew
[1:44:00] that killed a thousand philistines
[1:44:03] because he had an experience
[1:44:06] that he was born again amen he had an
[1:44:09] experience that he was a nazarite
[1:44:12] and the god of heaven was with him amen
[1:44:15] it was philip who had seen jesus in
[1:44:18] farmer experiences
[1:44:20] who went and found nathanael around
[1:44:22] behind the mountain
[1:44:24] and he said come see who we have found
[1:44:27] jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
[1:44:31] and the man being very orthodox he said
[1:44:33] now could there be any good thing come
[1:44:35] from nazareth
[1:44:36] he said come and see why he had
[1:44:40] been with jesus he knew that there was
[1:44:43] something about the man
[1:44:46] that was more than a match for anything
[1:44:49] the devil could stand up
[1:44:53] oh listen closely and as they go around
[1:44:56] the mountain
[1:44:58] philip is beginning to talk and
[1:45:00] nathaniel speaking with
[1:45:02] him and he said to him now when you get
[1:45:05] there
[1:45:06] i have seen him when peter come up
[1:45:09] and he didn't even never see peter
[1:45:12] and all his life but when he got there
[1:45:15] he said
[1:45:16] your name is simon
[1:45:19] and you are the son of jonas
[1:45:23] knew his name and knew who his daddy was
[1:45:26] or he couldn't believe that but philip
[1:45:30] had once been with him so he know to
[1:45:33] persuade him how he could be
[1:45:34] how he did it so when he walked up into
[1:45:37] the presence of jesus of nazareth
[1:45:40] he'd come then to believe then when he
[1:45:43] looked at him
[1:45:44] he said to him he said behold an
[1:45:47] israelite in whom there is no guile
[1:45:51] and he said to him when did you know me
[1:45:54] rabbi and he said before philip
[1:45:58] called you when
[1:46:01] you were under the tree i saw you
[1:46:05] now it's astonished him how could he do
[1:46:08] it
[1:46:09] but philip knew
[1:46:12] that to persuade nathanael that it could
[1:46:16] be
[1:46:16] done because he'd had an experience of
[1:46:18] being with jesus
[1:46:19] amen you know there's something about
[1:46:21] being with jesus gives you an experience
[1:46:24] being around where he's at watching his
[1:46:26] work then that gives you faith
[1:46:28] when you have an experience it gives
[1:46:30] faith faith goes by your experience
[1:46:33] now noticing this now as he come up
[1:46:37] well we can see them as they begin
[1:46:38] speaking to each other as they moved up
[1:46:41] and he began to tell him what was taking
[1:46:43] place and who he was and where he come
[1:46:45] from
[1:46:45] and all about it and then as quick as he
[1:46:48] got the experience oh
[1:46:52] blessed be the name of the lord when he
[1:46:55] got the experience
[1:46:57] that a miracle of god had been performed
[1:47:00] on him
[1:47:02] then he could fall at his feet and say
[1:47:04] rabbi
[1:47:06] thou art the son of the living god
[1:47:10] thou art the king of israel but first he
[1:47:13] had to see it done
[1:47:15] he could have faith in god after god had
[1:47:18] manifested himself
[1:47:20] that's what god does the woman
[1:47:23] that brother neville was reading about
[1:47:24] tonight in the bible
[1:47:26] she was sitting out the whale or getting
[1:47:29] her water out of the well
[1:47:31] she was a samaritan she had been taught
[1:47:34] that there was coming a messiah
[1:47:36] who would do great signs and wonders she
[1:47:38] knowed a little about it
[1:47:40] and when they dipped the bucket into the
[1:47:42] well to get the water
[1:47:44] jesus said bring me a drink
[1:47:47] and she said while you have nothing to
[1:47:49] draw with
[1:47:50] and why would you ask me for a drink see
[1:47:53] you at your samaritan first
[1:47:54] we have no dealings with each other and
[1:47:57] so forth
[1:47:57] the conversation went on by and by
[1:48:01] here's what taking place
[1:48:02] he found where her trouble was remember
[1:48:06] she first come out there to criticize
[1:48:08] him as a jew
[1:48:10] but he said go get your husband and come
[1:48:13] here
[1:48:15] she said i don't have any husband
[1:48:18] said that's right you've got five
[1:48:21] and the one that you have now is not
[1:48:23] your husband
[1:48:25] and quickly as soon as that happened she
[1:48:28] was
[1:48:28] puzzled in her mind remember she went to
[1:48:31] a coal formal church
[1:48:33] she know not what to do she said well
[1:48:36] now sir
[1:48:36] i perceive that you are a prophet that
[1:48:39] we know when the messiah cometh that
[1:48:41] he'll tell us these things
[1:48:42] he said i'm he that speaks to you
[1:48:46] oh what an experience i am he that
[1:48:50] speaks with you and what did she
[1:48:54] say she ran
[1:48:57] into the city with an experience
[1:49:00] amen that she had witnessed that jesus
[1:49:04] was the son of the living god
[1:49:07] ever she had seen a power working in him
[1:49:12] that it performed a miracle that told
[1:49:15] her who she was
[1:49:16] and where her sin was and where her
[1:49:19] trouble was
[1:49:20] therefore she could run and say truly
[1:49:23] that is the son of god come see the man
[1:49:26] that told me the things that i've done
[1:49:28] isn't this the very messiah
[1:49:32] now notice again in a few moments
[1:49:36] they had a woman that had a blood issue
[1:49:39] she
[1:49:39] cried and tried everything to do to get
[1:49:42] well she couldn't do it
[1:49:43] she pressed to the crowd and she touched
[1:49:46] the border of his garment
[1:49:47] for she believed now what faith cometh
[1:49:50] by hearing hearing of the word of god
[1:49:54] amen she pressed through because faith
[1:49:57] comes by hearing
[1:49:58] she touched his garment and she said
[1:50:00] that satisfies me
[1:50:02] i've touched him and she goes back into
[1:50:05] the crowd
[1:50:07] believing in her heart that something
[1:50:10] would
[1:50:10] take place am i oh if people today could
[1:50:14] only get that
[1:50:16] believing and when it taken place
[1:50:19] jesus turned and said who has touched me
[1:50:23] and peter said all of them are touching
[1:50:25] you why do you say who touched me
[1:50:27] he said but i got weak i'm so weak
[1:50:30] virtue strength has gone from me i am
[1:50:34] weak and he said well how did you know
[1:50:36] that
[1:50:37] and he looked around over the crowd she
[1:50:40] thought she was hit she was back out
[1:50:41] there hitting the crowd
[1:50:43] and when jesus turned and looked at her
[1:50:45] he told her what her trouble was
[1:50:47] and that she had been healed and that it
[1:50:50] was that she could
[1:50:52] fall down at his feet and confess all
[1:50:54] things
[1:50:56] after she had an experience of his great
[1:50:59] magnificent power
[1:51:00] to reveal to her that she had touched
[1:51:03] the
[1:51:04] garment not only of him but of him that
[1:51:06] liveth forever
[1:51:08] almighty god certainly it was
[1:51:12] now it was the people on the day of
[1:51:14] pentecost
[1:51:15] that was cowardly and they were in an
[1:51:18] upper room
[1:51:18] the doors were all closed they were
[1:51:21] afraid
[1:51:22] of the jews but when god
[1:51:25] came in the form of the holy ghost and
[1:51:28] baptized every one of that group with
[1:51:30] the baptism of the holy ghost and fire
[1:51:33] it was then they could go into the
[1:51:35] street and that man who
[1:51:37] cursed in the presence of jesus a few
[1:51:39] days before could say ye
[1:51:41] man of judea and you that dwell in
[1:51:43] jerusalem
[1:51:44] let this be known unto you and
[1:51:46] heartening my words these are not
[1:51:47] drunken as you supposed seen it's the
[1:51:49] third holiday
[1:51:50] but this is that was just spoken about
[1:51:52] the prophet joel
[1:51:54] certainly after he had an experience
[1:51:57] before he had the experience
[1:51:58] he had faith to believe it but after the
[1:52:00] experience come
[1:52:02] experience brought the results certainly
[1:52:05] at the end
[1:52:05] now those people that jesus spoke to
[1:52:09] there about the tree
[1:52:10] now notice just a moment now as we close
[1:52:12] as he was coming to
[1:52:14] the out of the temple one day he run
[1:52:16] down to a tree to find out
[1:52:18] if he can find something to eat on this
[1:52:21] tree
[1:52:21] there was nothing there because the time
[1:52:24] of figs wasn't yet
[1:52:25] and he could find nothing so he said to
[1:52:28] the tree
[1:52:29] no man eateth from thee from henceforth
[1:52:33] no one eateth and the next day they
[1:52:36] never seen any difference in the tree
[1:52:38] right then
[1:52:39] it didn't show any results any physical
[1:52:42] results
[1:52:42] now here's where i want you to get it it
[1:52:46] showed no results but what did he say
[1:52:50] no man eateth from me and
[1:52:53] 24 hours about noon the next day they
[1:52:56] passed by the same tree
[1:52:58] and in there they noticed that the tree
[1:53:01] had begun to wither
[1:53:03] and peter said behold the tree which
[1:53:05] doubted curse
[1:53:06] it's already withering from the roots
[1:53:09] now watch what jesus said now as we
[1:53:12] close
[1:53:13] have faith in god
[1:53:16] what he showed him his power first
[1:53:20] he showed it on a fig tree what he
[1:53:23] could do because when he asked the
[1:53:26] father
[1:53:27] anything he believed that he received
[1:53:29] what he asked for
[1:53:31] then he told them you have faith in god
[1:53:34] for i say to you if you'd say to this
[1:53:36] mountain
[1:53:37] be moved and be lifted up and thrown
[1:53:40] into the sea
[1:53:41] and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:53:44] believe that those things that you say
[1:53:47] is coming to pass you shall have
[1:53:51] what you say do you get it
[1:53:54] here it is in the original greek lesson
[1:53:56] you see believe
[1:53:58] that what you say shall come to pass
[1:54:01] you can have what you say
[1:54:04] have faith in god believe that what you
[1:54:07] ask for you receive it
[1:54:09] believe it's already taken place and you
[1:54:11] can have
[1:54:12] what you say now about the mountain
[1:54:15] being moved
[1:54:16] maybe one little grain of sand begin to
[1:54:18] move
[1:54:19] but anyhow in the eyes of god it was
[1:54:22] already taking place
[1:54:24] if you believe tonight that no matter
[1:54:27] what's wrong with you
[1:54:28] if you believe when you ask god that you
[1:54:30] get what you say
[1:54:32] you can have what you say have faith in
[1:54:36] god but first
[1:54:37] god's got to prove himself to you that
[1:54:39] he he is still the same
[1:54:41] lord god he's still the same powerful
[1:54:44] jehovah
[1:54:45] now jesus said the things that i do
[1:54:47] shall you also
[1:54:49] now to you here tonight in the
[1:54:50] tabernacle while we're starting
[1:54:53] to have the prayer life how many of you
[1:54:55] would say this
[1:54:56] if i could see jesus christ perform the
[1:55:00] same
[1:55:00] miracles and do the same thing that he
[1:55:02] did when he was here on earth
[1:55:04] i in my heart would accept god and
[1:55:07] believe that whatever is wrong with me
[1:55:09] would take place as soon as i asked god
[1:55:11] would you believe it
[1:55:13] would you raise your hand say god i will
[1:55:15] believe with all no matter what it is
[1:55:18] now there's no one can heal healing is a
[1:55:21] finished
[1:55:22] product of god if any man tells you that
[1:55:25] he can heal you
[1:55:26] if he's a doctor and can tell you he can
[1:55:28] heal you he's wrong
[1:55:30] well there's only one healer that's god
[1:55:33] a doctor can give medicine he can put
[1:55:36] medicine in a sore
[1:55:37] to kill the germs in it so it'll get
[1:55:40] well what does happen
[1:55:41] the medicine doesn't heal the medicine
[1:55:44] only keeps the bad germs out kills the
[1:55:46] bad germs that kill the good germs and
[1:55:48] kill you
[1:55:49] so science works on different poisons
[1:55:52] that they put into your system to poison
[1:55:54] certain germs that won't poison you
[1:55:56] that's what
[1:55:57] science does that's what medicine is
[1:56:00] is it something that'll kill a certain
[1:56:02] germ and it won't kill you
[1:56:04] these antibiotics kill both to a great
[1:56:07] big
[1:56:08] extent so therefore they that's really
[1:56:10] hard to take like penicillin sometimes
[1:56:12] it kills a person
[1:56:14] now a doctor can move an obstruction
[1:56:17] he can uh bone together but he can heal
[1:56:21] god's the one who does the healing god
[1:56:23] produces a calcium
[1:56:25] god produces the multiplication of the
[1:56:28] cells to build your body back
[1:56:30] or they've moved appendix or something
[1:56:32] like that god is the only healer
[1:56:34] now jesus promised that he would heal us
[1:56:37] if you'll ask anything in my name i'll
[1:56:41] do it when you pray believe that you
[1:56:44] receive what you ask for
[1:56:45] you shall have it it's yours believe
[1:56:47] that it comes to pass now
[1:56:49] now when he displayed his great powers
[1:56:51] on earth
[1:56:52] now he didn't heal people until the
[1:56:54] father showed him first what to do saint
[1:56:56] john 5 19.
[1:56:58] he said if thou canst believe all things
[1:57:01] are possible
[1:57:02] and then in saint john 5 19 he said i do
[1:57:04] nothing till i see the father do it
[1:57:06] first
[1:57:07] whatever the father shows me that does
[1:57:09] the sun likewise how many knows the
[1:57:11] bible says did you ever read
[1:57:12] the bible certainly now when he did that
[1:57:16] on his journey here on earth he did it
[1:57:18] in one city they believed him they were
[1:57:20] healed thousands
[1:57:21] goes to another city does it they
[1:57:23] believe
[1:57:24] goes to his own city his own home and
[1:57:27] when he started to do it they said who
[1:57:29] is this man
[1:57:30] where did he get this wisdom how does he
[1:57:33] know how to perform these things
[1:57:34] we know him and the bible said
[1:57:38] that many mighty works he could not do
[1:57:41] because of their
[1:57:42] unbelief many mighty works he could not
[1:57:46] do
[1:57:47] now i pray if there's a sinner here
[1:57:50] tonight
[1:57:50] that when you see if he will do it this
[1:57:53] is my hometown
[1:57:54] and this is the hardest place i have
[1:57:56] ever battled in my life
[1:57:58] i've been with the hot and tots in
[1:58:00] africa i've been in india with the
[1:58:02] hoodoo isms and everything else and
[1:58:04] challenged by their witch doctors and so
[1:58:06] forth and i've never had the struggle
[1:58:08] to get the spirit of god to work like i
[1:58:10] have in my own hometown it's exactly
[1:58:12] right
[1:58:12] not because people don't love me because
[1:58:14] the bible is true
[1:58:16] verily verily i say unto you that a
[1:58:18] prophet within his own country is on his
[1:58:20] own county
[1:58:21] is not without honor except it's in that
[1:58:22] place it has to be that way
[1:58:24] now let us bow our heads just a moment
[1:58:26] while we pray
[1:58:32] oh blessed lord who made the heavens and
[1:58:36] earth
[1:58:36] created them with thy own blessed hand
[1:58:40] i pray thee lord to be kind and merciful
[1:58:44] to us tonight
[1:58:45] pardoning our sins and our
[1:58:47] transgressions
[1:58:48] i pray thee to be kind to those who are
[1:58:51] sick
[1:58:52] and needy granted lord and if there be
[1:58:55] sin in our midst o eternal god
[1:58:59] forgive it for just in the next few
[1:59:02] moments
[1:59:04] your word is either found right or it's
[1:59:07] found
[1:59:08] wrong it's either
[1:59:11] found to be true or it is an error
[1:59:15] is still god or the scriptures is wrong
[1:59:20] and lord preaching this believing it
[1:59:24] holding it to the showdown lord the word
[1:59:27] that there must be something take place
[1:59:30] there must be either god must prove
[1:59:33] himself real or
[1:59:35] the people has a right to say i
[1:59:38] first have to see it but lord
[1:59:42] the people born in sin shaped in
[1:59:44] iniquity
[1:59:45] as we all are come to the world
[1:59:48] speaking lies then we know lord that the
[1:59:51] merciful
[1:59:52] god will surely have mercy upon us and
[1:59:55] will
[1:59:55] help us dear god we pray tonight for
[1:59:58] each individual here that your
[2:00:00] spirit will rest upon them forgiving our
[2:00:04] sins and our
[2:00:05] wicked ways and may we acknowledge the
[2:00:07] lord jesus as our blessed savior just
[2:00:10] now
[2:00:11] and may his spirit be kind now father
[2:00:14] it is written in the word by the lips of
[2:00:17] our own blessed
[2:00:18] lord and savior your son
[2:00:21] that has been said this way the things
[2:00:25] that i
[2:00:25] do shall you also he that believeth on
[2:00:29] me shall do the works that i
[2:00:31] do a little while in the world won't see
[2:00:35] me no
[2:00:35] more yet ye shall see me for i will be
[2:00:38] with you and in you to the end
[2:00:41] of the age you made a promise that the
[2:00:44] unbelieving children of adam
[2:00:47] would never be able to see you no more
[2:00:50] after you left the earth
[2:00:52] but that the believer would see you in
[2:00:54] power and demonstration
[2:00:56] in every generation we believe that lord
[2:01:00] and we believe that we're living in the
[2:01:02] last days of the gentile dispensation
[2:01:05] that it's soon to close and you've
[2:01:08] raised up these mighty works
[2:01:10] that the gentiles might not have an
[2:01:12] excuse
[2:01:13] you've had your picture taken with us as
[2:01:16] the great pillar of fire that led the
[2:01:18] children of israel
[2:01:20] and how what a phenomenon it is and to
[2:01:23] see you
[2:01:24] if it would just be the picture alone if
[2:01:27] we could say
[2:01:28] well it might have been such and such
[2:01:30] even though the scientific world said it
[2:01:32] was true
[2:01:33] but when we see the spirit come down
[2:01:37] and manifest and do the same things that
[2:01:40] he did
[2:01:40] then we're bound to recognize it to be
[2:01:43] the risen lord
[2:01:45] help us tonight lord we are eternity
[2:01:48] bound people we got our heads towards
[2:01:50] the dust where you taken us from
[2:01:52] and we're on our road back swiftly
[2:01:56] this little time of preparation is for
[2:01:57] our souls
[2:01:59] be kind now lord and as your servant
[2:02:02] stands
[2:02:03] oh god
[2:02:06] will i have faith to believe that god
[2:02:10] cannot lie
[2:02:12] that he'll keep his promise
[2:02:15] he must do it in order to be god
[2:02:19] lord is my age is creeping along
[2:02:22] and i don't know how much longer i've
[2:02:24] got to stay here
[2:02:26] i pray god that you'll give me
[2:02:29] great experiences even greater than what
[2:02:33] has been done if it be possible
[2:02:36] that the people might know and
[2:02:38] experience
[2:02:39] that the living word of god is part of
[2:02:42] god
[2:02:43] and may every person be without an
[2:02:46] excuse tonight
[2:02:47] when we leave here if they should turn
[2:02:49] their
[2:02:50] back upon thee granite save souls and
[2:02:54] heal the sick
[2:02:55] for we ask that in the name of thy child
[2:02:57] the lord jesus our blessed savior
[2:03:00] amen amen
[2:03:11] thank you for your attention i know i
[2:03:14] kept you just a
[2:03:15] little long i just
[2:03:18] love that good old word i was born in it
[2:03:23] i want to die with it the place i want
[2:03:27] to go is
[2:03:28] right here behind the platform
[2:03:31] like to go home to meet god if i had a
[2:03:34] 20 lives to live for a hundred lives
[2:03:37] i want every one of them for the lord
[2:03:39] jesus
[2:03:41] even if there wasn't a heaven to go to
[2:03:43] afterwards i'd still want to serve the
[2:03:45] lord jesus
[2:03:46] for the peace and satisfaction that i
[2:03:48] have
[2:03:49] of knowing that he lives and because he
[2:03:52] lives i can live
[2:03:54] also now if i stood here tonight
[2:03:57] to tell this little group of people that
[2:04:00] i had powers to heal someone
[2:04:03] i you would know quickly are people who
[2:04:05] knows the bible to know
[2:04:06] that i'd be deceiving i have no powers
[2:04:10] to heal
[2:04:11] neither is there any man in the world
[2:04:13] got powers to heal
[2:04:14] it's only through christ in your faith
[2:04:17] in the finished work
[2:04:18] every sinner can be saved just now but
[2:04:21] why
[2:04:22] because jesus comes down and saves you
[2:04:24] now no because he saved you when he died
[2:04:26] for you at calvary
[2:04:28] that was finished the whole plan of
[2:04:30] salvation
[2:04:31] and for your healing it's your personal
[2:04:33] faith
[2:04:34] in the living god
[2:04:49] amen praise the lord
[2:04:52] again let's test our faith
[2:04:57] making sure that it's in the heart in
[2:05:00] your soul
[2:05:01] not in your head amen but your control
[2:05:04] from the inside out
[2:05:06] not from here down but from the inside
[2:05:08] out
[2:05:09] as the bible and the prophet of god has
[2:05:11] explained to us that god
[2:05:12] through the holy ghost he said in our
[2:05:14] souls is there to control our spirits
[2:05:17] amen according to the word and then it
[2:05:20] moves on to control your thoughts
[2:05:22] amen because there's too many believers
[2:05:24] they're controlled by their thoughts
[2:05:26] and their feelings yes in their spirit
[2:05:29] but not the holy spirit
[2:05:31] amen because it's all from the inside
[2:05:33] out that the enemy is working
[2:05:35] amen that you're going by your feelings
[2:05:37] you're going by your
[2:05:38] intellectual thoughts amen this is what
[2:05:40] have the devil deceived eve
[2:05:42] and yeah in the in the garden
[2:05:45] he he said yeah yet god said so he
[2:05:48] wanted to get into a discussion
[2:05:49] on what god said the letter of the word
[2:05:52] and he would add to it and take from it
[2:05:54] and again it's just one word where it
[2:05:57] says god said thou shalt surely die
[2:05:59] but god don't put no butts in it
[2:06:02] no no the devil puts butts in it amen
[2:06:06] so i pray the grace of god then i earn
[2:06:08] our witness and what we're standing for
[2:06:10] amen there's no buts it's but rather it
[2:06:13] is written
[2:06:15] you know and that the devil comes back
[2:06:17] yes but
[2:06:18] you know thus saith the lord yes but
[2:06:21] yeah
[2:06:22] and any and he'll just change your word
[2:06:24] oh yeah
[2:06:25] just change maybe add a word take away a
[2:06:27] word
[2:06:28] and sometimes you might feel yourself
[2:06:30] being uh sense yourself being controlled
[2:06:32] by
[2:06:33] by a feeling but what about faith faith
[2:06:36] just believes the word
[2:06:38] amen don't add to it make me no wonder
[2:06:40] brother brahms warned us
[2:06:42] he said don't make it bigger than what
[2:06:44] it is don't make it smaller than what it
[2:06:46] is
[2:06:47] leave it he said the way it is amen
[2:06:50] so brother sister i pray god help us
[2:06:53] that we're going to leave it the way
[2:06:54] that it is
[2:06:55] we're not going to put any butts into it
[2:06:57] which is it is written
[2:06:59] no buts they'll say the lord no buts
[2:07:03] amen the word so brother how many of us
[2:07:06] are really truly
[2:07:07] coming into the faith that god wants to
[2:07:09] see in us
[2:07:10] how many really truly uh got
[2:07:13] resurrection
[2:07:14] and rapturing faith well this
[2:07:17] is the in all the prophet has said
[2:07:20] brothers there's anything that we got
[2:07:22] we got to focus on is the resurrection
[2:07:24] and the rapture
[2:07:26] and become and let it become more and
[2:07:28] more real to us
[2:07:30] so how many are living for the
[2:07:31] resurrection i mean living for the
[2:07:33] rapture
[2:07:35] where is our faith is it just in
[2:07:36] doctrine or they believe this but we
[2:07:38] believe that
[2:07:40] but they believe this but we believe
[2:07:43] that
[2:07:44] now forget it brother again
[2:07:48] it's like brother neville and you hear
[2:07:50] him responding to the word there
[2:07:53] when the lord called brother neville off
[2:07:54] the scene
[2:07:56] one of the brethren that was with him in
[2:07:58] the last moment
[2:08:00] was brother lee vale and our brother
[2:08:03] might have been in a hospital
[2:08:04] at the time and it was just before god
[2:08:08] took him really off the s off the earth
[2:08:11] brother level said brother neville
[2:08:14] he said is there anything you want me to
[2:08:16] convey he said to the believers to the
[2:08:19] bride
[2:08:20] anything you want to tell us he said you
[2:08:22] know that the lord wants to tell us
[2:08:24] and he said well he said yes brother
[2:08:26] neville he said go tell him
[2:08:29] he said that what they're looking for is
[2:08:30] already here
[2:08:32] yeah the resurrection the rapture it's
[2:08:35] already here the faith for it
[2:08:37] see luther believed it was there he just
[2:08:39] kept on preaching it
[2:08:41] wesley and the pentecostals the gifts of
[2:08:43] the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:08:45] or they kept on preaching kept on
[2:08:47] preaching it and
[2:08:48] so on but now for you and me i trust by
[2:08:52] the grace of god
[2:08:53] we're not going to just focus on oh yeah
[2:08:56] the there
[2:08:57] we got the understanding of the trinity
[2:08:59] we got the understanding of
[2:09:00] of this this revelation that revelation
[2:09:02] oh yes and we know about denominations
[2:09:05] and so on but how many are really
[2:09:08] focusing on the resurrection
[2:09:10] how many are focusing on the rapture if
[2:09:12] you want to go you'll be focusing on
[2:09:15] and brother god is allowing all these
[2:09:16] things to bring out the hunger and
[2:09:19] thirst of the bride
[2:09:20] for the resurrection for the rapture
[2:09:22] you've got to want it
[2:09:24] if you want to go you'll go if you don't
[2:09:26] want to go you won't go
[2:09:27] well i don't mind i yeah i like to go
[2:09:30] like to go
[2:09:33] probably more than that the devil likes
[2:09:34] to go you know
[2:09:36] but all about believing that you're
[2:09:38] going i'm going
[2:09:40] this is why i'm getting more and more
[2:09:42] and more separated from the world
[2:09:43] this is why the world's getting more and
[2:09:45] more crazy to in my my eyes
[2:09:47] and in what i what i'm seeing and god
[2:09:50] god is doing that for a reason
[2:09:53] because again we were reminded that
[2:09:56] when the rapture takes place the
[2:09:58] resurrection takes place that
[2:10:00] that there's going to be those so those
[2:10:02] left behind
[2:10:03] are going to say oh i thought there was
[2:10:04] to be a resurrection i thought there was
[2:10:05] to be a rapture
[2:10:07] it already happened and you didn't know
[2:10:08] it didn't know it
[2:10:12] why didn't they know it but they weren't
[2:10:14] into the spirit of what god was doing
[2:10:16] amen and then and god allowed
[2:10:20] like this to happen that to happen he
[2:10:22] allowed this covert 19 to happen
[2:10:24] and it is to get get everybody's
[2:10:25] attention on this this and this and this
[2:10:27] and maybe
[2:10:28] like we weren't allowed to worship here
[2:10:30] there only five of us
[2:10:32] uh five including the the ministry
[2:10:36] and so on the ministry was preaching to
[2:10:38] four four people
[2:10:40] yeah when we were allowed that and that
[2:10:42] was uh
[2:10:43] brother matthew i believe at the
[2:10:45] computers back there
[2:10:47] and then uh brother bob did the song
[2:10:49] service
[2:10:51] yeah and uh that was it
[2:10:54] that and so i it was all basically was
[2:10:56] here
[2:10:58] and uh so my lord i said this this is
[2:11:01] getting unusual for sure
[2:11:03] and it's going to come it's going to get
[2:11:05] worse
[2:11:07] now and we'll we'll be separated of
[2:11:09] course the prophet is saying the hour is
[2:11:10] coming
[2:11:11] we won't be allowed to get together and
[2:11:13] preach the word
[2:11:14] and preach this and preach that no and
[2:11:17] so
[2:11:17] and again god allowed this to happen
[2:11:19] what was it to separate
[2:11:21] separate separate physically but not
[2:11:24] spiritually
[2:11:25] amen so to bring forth what where our
[2:11:28] emphasis
[2:11:28] is is our emphasis on the physical or is
[2:11:31] it spiritual
[2:11:32] are we looking for something physical or
[2:11:33] spiritual well
[2:11:35] physical in a sense but it's the only
[2:11:37] physical we're looking for
[2:11:39] is a glorified body a man by the grace
[2:11:42] of god not
[2:11:43] not in a dream not by any means and not
[2:11:45] just a vision it's going to be reality
[2:11:47] but he said there's going to be so few
[2:11:50] in the rapture that when they do
[2:11:52] we won't know it and and and another
[2:11:55] reason why we won't know is because
[2:11:56] we're going to be separated so much
[2:11:59] government is going to do this and do
[2:12:00] that not necessarily going to focus on
[2:12:03] oh you're what you teach and what you
[2:12:05] believe we've got to stop
[2:12:06] you go and join this church go join that
[2:12:08] church
[2:12:09] so on no it's just that things are going
[2:12:11] to get so bad around the world
[2:12:14] and everybody's going to get caught up
[2:12:15] with what's going on like the covert 19
[2:12:17] thing caught up with this caught up with
[2:12:19] that amen
[2:12:20] and that they're taking up with even the
[2:12:22] vaccines
[2:12:24] that people are giving out and
[2:12:27] speaking to a brother in the states not
[2:12:30] long ago and i said well i said brother
[2:12:32] again it's what is i'll tell you what
[2:12:34] it's going to become
[2:12:35] i said everything is going to become a
[2:12:37] money-making affair
[2:12:39] oh yeah they're going to be in it for
[2:12:40] making money for this money for that you
[2:12:41] know
[2:12:42] not that they're real disappointed over
[2:12:44] the cobra 19 disease
[2:12:46] no no oh wonderful we can make more
[2:12:48] money
[2:12:49] oh yeah we sell more sell more masks and
[2:12:52] we'll get more
[2:12:53] the vast the backs of the what they call
[2:12:56] bad
[2:12:57] vaccines and so on this one's going to
[2:13:00] do it this one's going to do it that
[2:13:01] one's going to do it
[2:13:02] oh yeah money money money money but
[2:13:05] still everybody's going to get confused
[2:13:07] and they had to be separated and
[2:13:08] separated and separated
[2:13:09] and that's why when the rapture comes
[2:13:13] there's going to be a lot won't know
[2:13:14] about it
[2:13:16] that's right because the churches will
[2:13:18] be so separated
[2:13:20] and i know even the big churches in the
[2:13:21] states and uh
[2:13:24] one of our brethren there they could
[2:13:25] only worship you know and then they said
[2:13:28] what what is the the first letter of
[2:13:30] your name
[2:13:31] and they said well we can go from a to a
[2:13:34] to
[2:13:35] g or something like that and whoever got
[2:13:37] the if that includes the
[2:13:39] the letter for your name uh well
[2:13:42] that's the one that can meet in the
[2:13:44] church now on that on sunday
[2:13:46] and the others won't we won't be allowed
[2:13:47] so we'll we'll have another meeting for
[2:13:49] them
[2:13:50] maybe in in a couple of weeks then those
[2:13:52] for those who go on to another
[2:13:54] oh yeah the brother was doing that oh
[2:13:56] yeah the pastor that that's what he was
[2:13:58] advising his people that only if you're
[2:14:01] only if your name
[2:14:01] started with this letter can you come to
[2:14:03] church sunday and then next sunday
[2:14:05] there'd be the others with different
[2:14:07] letters and so on
[2:14:08] so brother and it's when people want to
[2:14:11] get confused they want to
[2:14:12] know this and know this and know that
[2:14:14] and the devil
[2:14:15] would try to get them to forget the
[2:14:18] rapture
[2:14:19] they won't focus on it about jade of the
[2:14:21] bride that's the only thing is in their
[2:14:22] mind
[2:14:23] like jesus the only thing in jesus mind
[2:14:26] was getting out of here
[2:14:27] and he knew what he knew the price he
[2:14:29] had to pay to get out and that's why he
[2:14:31] cried and wept like he did
[2:14:33] and the disciples were sleeping
[2:14:36] and and finally
[2:14:40] it got so bad he said lord he said not
[2:14:42] my will
[2:14:43] thine be done amen so are we going to in
[2:14:47] the in all those
[2:14:48] circumstances that we're going to face
[2:14:50] we're going to endure
[2:14:51] pressure is going to be put there to try
[2:14:54] to get us to compromise
[2:14:55] in our faith compromise on what we
[2:14:58] believe
[2:14:59] you know and do it this way and do it
[2:15:00] that way well god help us
[2:15:03] it's my prayer that we're going to be
[2:15:04] numbered with the few that are going
[2:15:07] honest again be on your guard please
[2:15:10] don't take it for granted say oh yeah
[2:15:12] well everything's going to be already
[2:15:13] lord look after me
[2:15:14] no god has given you what you need to
[2:15:16] look after yourself
[2:15:18] well god's going to do this no god gives
[2:15:20] you this till you do it
[2:15:21] yeah so everything becomes personal
[2:15:25] and and so on so again
[2:15:28] you know what we feel god wants to do it
[2:15:30] god wants to brother brown said yeah
[2:15:32] that's the trouble with with believers
[2:15:33] today said he said
[2:15:35] you're only interested in what god what
[2:15:37] god's going to do for you what are you
[2:15:38] going to do for him
[2:15:40] that's the truth god do this god do that
[2:15:43] god do that no
[2:15:44] god well god gave luther what he needed
[2:15:46] to do what god wanted him to do
[2:15:47] and he did it and i done to the
[2:15:49] pentecost does god give them what he
[2:15:51] wanted them to do and he did it
[2:15:53] amen and oh if oh lord do you want me to
[2:15:56] do something else and
[2:15:57] he will give you a greater anointing
[2:15:59] great anointing and you move on and do
[2:16:01] it
[2:16:01] again that's why again praise the lord
[2:16:04] that's why the prophecy that god is
[2:16:05] waiting
[2:16:06] on you god's waiting on us he said and
[2:16:09] he said the saints that are going on
[2:16:10] they're waiting on us
[2:16:12] wait waiting on us what are we waiting
[2:16:15] on us for
[2:16:17] to get into a resurrection of rapturing
[2:16:19] faith amen by the grace of god
[2:16:22] so that is not a doctrine amen
[2:16:25] it's a real faith by the grace of god
[2:16:28] it's again it's like i heard the prophet
[2:16:31] was saying
[2:16:33] concerning him and his two daughters
[2:16:37] and uh you know you know the story where
[2:16:40] brother brown was away from home when he
[2:16:42] came home his two young daughters came
[2:16:44] out to
[2:16:45] greet him and uh and they did
[2:16:49] one of his children did i like that they
[2:16:52] were jealous over
[2:16:54] those to whom he ministered oh yeah
[2:16:56] because they had more of a brother bam's
[2:16:58] attention than they did
[2:16:59] than than their his sons and daughters
[2:17:03] amen so when he came home that night and
[2:17:06] his daughters went out to greet him
[2:17:08] and of course we know what happened that
[2:17:10] that
[2:17:12] rebecca was she jumped up at her
[2:17:14] father's arms and put her put her arms
[2:17:16] around him and around his head and
[2:17:17] around his
[2:17:18] shoulders and she told sarah sarah she
[2:17:22] said
[2:17:22] oh she said i got all a daddy and
[2:17:25] there's none there for you.
[2:17:28] and so so brother branham heard
[2:17:31] rebecca say that and uh he just motioned
[2:17:35] to
[2:17:35] sarah to come toward him and he pulled
[2:17:38] her up
[2:17:39] and he put his arms around her and that
[2:17:42] oh praise
[2:17:42] well praise the lord for that revelation
[2:17:45] she said becky
[2:17:46] i got something to tell you she said you
[2:17:49] might have all of that issues but i got
[2:17:50] i want you to know daddy's got all of me
[2:17:53] amen so the grace of god brother
[2:17:56] you got all the god in in the letter of
[2:17:58] the word amen
[2:18:00] with you and so on but but how many as
[2:18:03] how many does god have does god have
[2:18:05] control of you
[2:18:06] amen so it's not not that we got all of
[2:18:09] god god
[2:18:10] got all of us and they know we know
[2:18:12] god's in control
[2:18:13] by grace for grace to help us
[2:18:16] brother with a genuine holy ghost faith
[2:18:20] in god by the grace of god
[2:18:26] he said now he said again little david
[2:18:28] was no match
[2:18:29] at all first he was just a young fellow
[2:18:32] and the next thing he was a ruddy fellow
[2:18:36] which means he and as we would call it
[2:18:38] and he said he was no match at all
[2:18:41] and he never had a sword in his hand
[2:18:43] perhaps he
[2:18:44] never picked up a shield in his life he
[2:18:47] know
[2:18:47] nothing about military training and
[2:18:50] sometimes what we're experiencing in
[2:18:52] life
[2:18:52] and the training and all that's going on
[2:18:55] oh yeah
[2:18:56] that trade that trains us but uh we're
[2:18:59] not we're not following the leadership
[2:19:00] of the holy ghost
[2:19:03] i don't remember the doctor's name now
[2:19:05] he was a medical doctor that i attended
[2:19:06] and he was
[2:19:07] it was good originally he was from
[2:19:09] greece
[2:19:11] and he used to be in charge of the
[2:19:13] hospital in bjorn
[2:19:14] but then he moved out on his own with
[2:19:16] his own clinic
[2:19:18] and and i would meet him
[2:19:21] and a couple of times that i went to him
[2:19:22] and i wondered one time there was a
[2:19:24] track in my
[2:19:25] pocket and uh when he was investigating
[2:19:29] me and checking things
[2:19:30] he said oh i got a question
[2:19:34] he said do you mean to tell me
[2:19:39] that he said somebody that maybe never
[2:19:42] had education
[2:19:43] that never went to a school never went
[2:19:45] to a college
[2:19:46] you know and trained or even the bible
[2:19:49] colleges
[2:19:50] he said you mean tell me that someone
[2:19:52] that didn't experience any of those
[2:19:53] things
[2:19:54] would have more understanding than
[2:19:56] someone that spent six or seven years in
[2:19:58] a bible college
[2:20:00] and i said yes that's what i'm telling
[2:20:03] you
[2:20:04] i said one got the letter of it in their
[2:20:06] heads and i said the other one gets the
[2:20:08] spiritual revelation
[2:20:09] in their heart and i said it's god in
[2:20:12] the soul
[2:20:13] not in the head oh
[2:20:17] that's what you meant i said yes because
[2:20:20] whenever i met him the doctor that we
[2:20:22] would talk end up talking about the word
[2:20:24] and the lord yeah and he was he was
[2:20:27] greek
[2:20:28] and so on so i said brother that that's
[2:20:30] that's the meaning of it oh i said can i
[2:20:32] have that track
[2:20:34] i said yes you can have the track he
[2:20:36] said i said take it
[2:20:37] and he took the track and laid it on his
[2:20:39] table amen
[2:20:41] so i pray god maybe he's gone on now for
[2:20:44] sure
[2:20:44] god rest his soul amen so we had to
[2:20:48] understand
[2:20:49] god god it's the devil trying to get us
[2:20:51] to put attention on the physical
[2:20:53] things of life god's put attention on
[2:20:55] the spiritual
[2:20:56] amen just leave it with the lord and
[2:20:58] then
[2:20:59] again like i said prophet said you want
[2:21:01] god to do this god do this god do that
[2:21:03] god doesn't
[2:21:05] you do it why christ speak
[2:21:09] yeah by the grace of god but no
[2:21:12] we want god to do it we want god we want
[2:21:14] this we want signs and wonders
[2:21:15] but brother god is pointing us to the
[2:21:18] word

[2:21:48] all the time
[2:21:50] and this was been caught up that was
[2:21:51] being caught up and so on
[2:21:53] so god help us that we're going to have
[2:21:55] the faith that pleases god
[2:21:57] and i'll tell you if we've got the real
[2:21:58] faith we've got real faith

[2:22:19] do that and i know
[2:22:21] too people are getting caught up too
[2:22:22] much with the natural things of life
[2:22:25] you know trust god take away the
[2:22:28] the money yeah you take away the
[2:22:32] the silver and the gold and so on amen

[2:22:36] gotta trust him bring our faith
[2:22:39] our faith in him by grace that we really
[2:22:42] believe
[2:22:43] god have mercy on us
[2:22:47] he talked about david again yeah a god
[2:22:50] type of faith he had faith
[2:22:53] yeah just think when he he would play
[2:22:56] music and sing it when he was looking
[2:22:58] after the
[2:22:58] the animals his father's sheep and lambs
[2:23:02] and so on
[2:23:03] and uh and so
[2:23:06] and like i said when the bear did what
[2:23:08] he did
[2:23:10] david why didn't you run away run
[2:23:13] no oh a lot a lot of believers would run
[2:23:17] away
[2:23:18] no he just he was so in the spirit
[2:23:21] so going by faith by faith by faith he
[2:23:23] just believed god he just trusted god
[2:23:26] no questions no doubts whatsoever and
[2:23:28] when the bear come and he he went over
[2:23:30] and killed the bear
[2:23:31] yeah you did yes
[2:23:35] and even when the lion come went over
[2:23:37] and killed the lion
[2:23:39] yeah and then when he when he went in to
[2:23:41] see israel and what israel was doing
[2:23:43] because of goliath what
[2:23:47] you nobody you're afraid of him if
[2:23:50] goliath he was he was a giant and
[2:23:52] and so on he was this high and he had
[2:23:54] all this and
[2:23:55] and he was challenging someone to come
[2:23:57] and and child to fight him
[2:23:59] and overcome him if you overcome him
[2:24:01] they would overcome
[2:24:02] the nation that he was representing and
[2:24:05] all israel was back there
[2:24:06] hiding oh mom we can't we can't we can't
[2:24:09] fight him what
[2:24:11] he couldn't fight him and david come
[2:24:14] and how did david do it by faith
[2:24:17] what was his faith yes
[2:24:21] faith oh i have faith in god god will be
[2:24:24] with me
[2:24:25] no not not like that
[2:24:29] his faith was was based on the word
[2:24:32] yeah his faith was based on the under on
[2:24:35] the covenant
[2:24:37] that god had between himself
[2:24:41] and the jews what was the faith
[2:24:45] amen well if you had faith
[2:24:49] the faith that god did this god did this
[2:24:51] you believed it you trusted him
[2:24:53] amen it was it was the circumcision
[2:24:57] because that's why he highlighted
[2:24:58] goliath he said
[2:25:00] you mean to tell me he said you're
[2:25:01] afraid of this uncircumcised philistine
[2:25:05] you you think he's going to do you think
[2:25:07] he's going to
[2:25:08] defeat you and get the victory over you
[2:25:10] no according according to the
[2:25:11] according to the covenant he said and we
[2:25:14] got the token of it
[2:25:15] so he said i'm not i'm not afraid he's
[2:25:17] uncircumcised he said i
[2:25:18] am yeah so he said i'm going to i'm
[2:25:21] going to defeat him because he's the
[2:25:22] enemy of god
[2:25:23] and david was it was that was this was
[2:25:25] the seed of god the son
[2:25:26] son son of god amen to god be the lord
[2:25:30] see
[2:25:30] where faith come down so basic we want
[2:25:32] to build it up make it like this
[2:25:34] god says this amen believe us
[2:25:38] thou this and there's does it control
[2:25:42] when it comes to what you believe is to
[2:25:43] control your life
[2:25:45] amen it brings god in control soul
[2:25:48] body and spirit amen so you you're
[2:25:51] thinking more about god
[2:25:52] and brother amazing
[2:25:56] when it comes to all that's going on in
[2:25:57] the world we there
[2:25:59] more and more people are thinking about
[2:26:00] the natural natural natural natural
[2:26:02] natural
[2:26:04] well but spiritual no matter what the
[2:26:06] enemy is tempting us like
[2:26:09] where's your spiritual where's your
[2:26:10] faith
[2:26:12] i i a lot of people convince confess the
[2:26:15] negative confess the negative confess
[2:26:17] the negative
[2:26:18] and when you're confessing faith say get
[2:26:20] behind me satan
[2:26:22] yeah if you really believe who you are
[2:26:25] as the seed of god
[2:26:27] elohim amen that well the word made
[2:26:30] flesh in you
[2:26:31] makes you god grace to us
[2:26:35] amen get behind me satan
[2:26:38] we are on our way home amen by the grace
[2:26:41] of god
[2:26:44] so david he know nothing about the
[2:26:46] military training
[2:26:48] but there's one thing he did know he
[2:26:51] knowed his god
[2:26:52] and that's the main thing he knew who he
[2:26:55] had believed
[2:26:58] and so when the giant made his challenge
[2:27:01] david knew another thing
[2:27:03] what was right and wrong
[2:27:07] so sometimes we go to church and doesn't
[2:27:09] seem to be hardly have the spiritual
[2:27:11] intelligence to know
[2:27:12] the difference if we do we don't
[2:27:16] act any different your actions are based
[2:27:20] on what you believe
[2:27:22] amen not your feelings your faith
[2:27:25] but he knew what was wrong and what what
[2:27:28] what was right and what was wrong
[2:27:30] he knew it was wrong for that philistine
[2:27:32] to defy the armies of the living god
[2:27:34] so he he said these words do you mean to
[2:27:37] tell me
[2:27:38] that you will let that uncircumcised
[2:27:40] philistine stand there
[2:27:42] and defy the armies of the living god
[2:27:45] what a rebuke to a trained army
[2:27:48] yeah that this young man here
[2:27:52] a shepherd boy yeah
[2:27:56] you're lowering us down you feel that
[2:27:59] we're nothing
[2:28:00] you're making us so small that we you
[2:28:02] know we can't do nothing
[2:28:04] well he said something wrong somewhere
[2:28:06] like i said the king offered him his
[2:28:07] sword and his shield
[2:28:09] but he just tried it that wasn't faith
[2:28:14] that was sight oh go go use the sword
[2:28:17] and and the shield and and get the
[2:28:19] victory over over over goliath that's
[2:28:21] all
[2:28:21] no oh no i'm not i don't god never
[2:28:25] trained me with that a man training man
[2:28:27] man with the sword and the shield but he
[2:28:30] was going forth by faith
[2:28:32] that whatever he did for the glory of
[2:28:35] god
[2:28:35] yeah it was for it was god's will it was
[2:28:38] god's will
[2:28:39] so that they they wouldn't contact or or
[2:28:42] attack
[2:28:43] the jews they wouldn't attack god's
[2:28:45] people
[2:28:47] yeah they were enemies
[2:28:50] not only enemies against the people but
[2:28:52] enemies against god and that's why he
[2:28:54] did
[2:28:55] david said oh yeah i know this is the he
[2:28:57] knew it was the will of god
[2:28:59] that that enemy be destroyed he knew it
[2:29:02] was the will of god
[2:29:04] that he'd be killed yeah because he was
[2:29:07] challenging not just israel he's
[2:29:08] challenging god
[2:29:10] and god has somebody there with faith
[2:29:14] yeah faith oh yeah well they were jews
[2:29:17] and they were all in in that covenant
[2:29:20] and they and they all had the token of
[2:29:22] that covenant yeah
[2:29:24] but still they were afraid didn't
[2:29:25] believe god was going to be with them
[2:29:27] didn't believe god was going to give him
[2:29:29] the victory over that that giant
[2:29:31] but david come well goodness god give me
[2:29:34] the victory over the lion
[2:29:36] and and the bear sure he said goliath
[2:29:39] won't mean nothing
[2:29:41] yeah and uh and he's
[2:29:44] instead he didn't need the short sword
[2:29:46] he didn't need the shield
[2:29:48] now so he left that with the king but he
[2:29:51] went down as i said
[2:29:53] and he just picked up of the the stones
[2:29:55] what
[2:29:56] david what are you doing stone giant
[2:29:59] slingshot what oh yes you're going to
[2:30:03] kill goliath with a slingshot
[2:30:06] you know we think we've got to have this
[2:30:07] we got to have this guy listen god in
[2:30:09] simplicity
[2:30:11] you'd have a god hidden and revealing
[2:30:12] simplicity
[2:30:14] david amen and you go through the
[2:30:17] scriptures you'll find the same
[2:30:18] amen well people want to build it up
[2:30:21] make it big make it this make it that
[2:30:23] god help us
[2:30:23] god forgive us that we'll stay with
[2:30:26] simplicity
[2:30:27] and he went out just to the water there
[2:30:30] picked up
[2:30:31] five stones thank god and put into his
[2:30:34] thing that he had there and he only used
[2:30:36] one
[2:30:38] he just needed one stone he said do you
[2:30:40] want to use a
[2:30:41] slingshot to kill goliath
[2:30:44] how could a small man like david
[2:30:48] take take a slingshot and put a stone in
[2:30:50] the slingshot
[2:30:52] and just want to throw that goliath
[2:30:55] goliath was challenging him good luck to
[2:30:58] it well even goliath it was a joke
[2:31:00] you know just a big laugh thing and to a
[2:31:02] lot of the jews it was
[2:31:04] it was a laugh thing and making fun of
[2:31:06] david and so on
[2:31:08] but to to to david
[2:31:12] just think he wasn't going to try it he
[2:31:15] knew
[2:31:15] what he was going to do he knew he was
[2:31:18] going to defeat
[2:31:19] goliath he knew he was going to break
[2:31:22] him down
[2:31:23] and cut his head off amen and the other
[2:31:27] jews
[2:31:28] all of them just think the whole army of
[2:31:30] israel and they were afraid of goliath
[2:31:32] and there's this
[2:31:32] one young one shepherd coming and he's
[2:31:36] yeah and he's just taking a stone and a
[2:31:38] slingshot oh we used to use lu
[2:31:40] i remember using slingshots back years
[2:31:42] ago we used slingshot for this string
[2:31:44] shot for that you know so on
[2:31:46] yeah but just think it wasn't just a
[2:31:49] uh something that entertained david no
[2:31:52] amen i assure you it must be an
[2:31:55] entertaining god
[2:31:56] to see that young man go out there with
[2:31:59] a slingshot and a few stones
[2:32:01] to kill goliath and he did
[2:32:05] why because god was with him and he was
[2:32:07] in the word
[2:32:08] he was in the covenant and he believed
[2:32:10] the covenant he stayed with the covenant
[2:32:12] he ate amen oh yeah just and again
[2:32:16] something struck me when i was thinking
[2:32:17] about it again this week concerning
[2:32:20] you know all the the old testament and
[2:32:22] we say oh it's just the new testament
[2:32:24] now no there's lessons we can be taught
[2:32:27] in the old testament
[2:32:28] and i said lord this is amazing i said
[2:32:31] in the old testament i said now i
[2:32:33] understand
[2:32:34] that why the brother i said wrote
[2:32:36] hebrews 11 by faith
[2:32:38] by faith by faith they did this by faith
[2:32:40] they did that and so on
[2:32:42] this is absolutely amazing that's true
[2:32:44] lord we can look at
[2:32:45] adam we can look at abraham and look at
[2:32:48] this one and this one i said they're all
[2:32:49] lived by faith
[2:32:50] they're all controlled by faith all
[2:32:52] controlled by the will of god
[2:32:54] amen they don't know what they wanted
[2:32:55] what god wanted to do they went and did
[2:32:57] it they lived for god
[2:32:58] they were living for god and god was
[2:33:00] there oh my this is amazing
[2:33:02] no matter what they do they never left
