Ezekiel 36 amen want to welcome brother Lord and sister may Smith and then all the way over from Alberta amen God bless you good to have you it's always good when people will drop into the church when they come through you know and it's not everyone does it but we certainly appreciate when they do so God bless you man uh brother Bob and sister Brenda of course are home this morning and with covid and so we want to remember them in prayer and also they had their 48-year anniversary on Friday so we want to say God bless them and it's certainly a milestone and a wonderful thing of course brother Chad is also home with Cova this morning so we want to remember him and then I I was speaking with brother Andrew Glover earlier this week and he's at brother Barry Johnson's in Calgary this week but he's got his throat's bugging him so we want to remember him in prayer that he'll be all fixed up and tuned up and ready to minister for us and certainly Minister for the Saints there in Calgary where he is this morning amen God bless you Ezekiel 36 and 24 says for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and we'll bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you in heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people people and I will be your God Amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing on our series of manifesting time and I want to take a title this morning of the order of life amen the order of life and this is something we're going to be we'll be covering for for quite some time because we're really getting into the meat of what it means to be adopted and and to do that you have to walk through the new birth and you have to walk through the process of becoming a child of God and we've spent three services now talking on the certainty of a seed and we went to Genesis and we talked about how a seed is locked down and it cannot be changed what's in it is is what's going to come out it can't change it can't decide to be something else it's got to produce what's inside of it and then we went to First Peter and we read where Peter said we're born of an Incorruptible seed that's spora and it's a spiritual seed and it cannot change but it's not that it just can't be changed but it cannot be killed and it cannot be stopped amen it's a seed that feeds on only one kind of nutrients and that's the word of God it only feeds on that which is like itself and brother Brown would say that's the Eternal part of you that's your soul that's the DNA that's the attribute of God that he placed in us before the foundation of the world and we talked about how the conditions have to be right that you can have a seed you can be a seed you can you can do all these things and it can be perfect it can have everything right inside of it but until the conditions are right then it won't come to life and it takes God to make the conditions right for the seed of God inside of us to come to life amen and we saw that there was a potential inside of us all the time there's a potential inside of a seed but until God quickens it until God makes the conditions right anything you do is going to just fall flat on its face and it's going to die and it's not going to produce what it's supposed to and then there's potential life but it takes God to Quicken it and bring us into that time of life where we're going to produce the word and in that we saw that God is responsible for his own word amen that he takes it and he speaks it he thinks it he speaks it and then he sends forth his Spirit to produce it and to make it come out the way that he said it was going to happen amen and that's that that great place of rest that I spoke about that security for the believer because when we read our portion of this word it's very Supernatural and then maybe some of it doesn't seem so Supernatural but when you start talking about Rapture and you start talking about a resurrection listen to Rapture we're still alive but how are you going to raise from the dead if you go by way of the Grave how are you going to race from the dead you don't have any power left to do anything and yet there's something that's supposed to be inside of us that's going to take us through and bring a resurrection not just to Rapture amen so when you look at those things what we have to do is say I can't do it that's a that's a starting place for a Believer is I can't do it and maybe sometimes that's the the thing that's holding us back as we've been trying to do it for so long that we've gotten down and disheartened because it's not working out and you need to come to a place where you say this isn't my work this isn't my strength it's not my power it's not even my word it's his power his strength his word and it's up to him to produce it amen the minute you can understand this isn't by your strength your power your thoughts that's when you can step into the hands of God that's when you can step into the word of God and then that's where the supernatural happens is when you step into him rather than he tries to force his way into you brother Brown would say this he would say the predestinated bride of Christ now the church the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church in it right now he says it's in it now everything he says everything is in order the Holy Spirit has been given the seed has been sowed in the evening lights have been shining so in other words God's done everything that he needs to do this is the evening time this is the end of the last stage this is the evening of the last day this is the end of all things for the Gentile bride and he's saying everything that God needs to do has been done amen everything that's going to produce the word for this hour that's going to do what the word says is supposed to do has been done here he says the Holy Spirit has been given in other words the quickening power has been dropped down the leadership the guide the inspiration everything we have need of for this life has been given when you get the Holy Spirit that's everything that you're ever going to need because that's God's life itself you have God's life inside of you there's nothing else that you're going to need because that'll rap you that'll resurrect you that'll destroy this flesh so that the the spirit of God can have its way in our lives it'll change your being it'll change your mind it'll change the way you approach things it'll change the way you react to things that'll do the full work inside of you and he says that's been given so that means that there's nothing else that you need it needs to finish its work but everything that the work is requiring has already been given to us amen that's the promise of Acts 2 38. you get the Holy Ghost and then that's it it's a finished work and now it's just a step out of time and into eternity but then beyond that he says the seed has been sowed so in other words the ones that have been laid aside we had seven Church ages and seeds had to be sold in each Church age but he says we're in the last age and the last stage seed has been sowed in other words it's been taken off the shelf and put in the ground to grow there's something that's got to happen you don't put a seed in the ground and expect it to be dormant you plant it in the time to prepare for the Harvest you plant it in the spring so that when the Harvest time comes in the fall there's something to actually Harvest so he says not only has the power been given but the seed has been sowed in other words you've been positionally placed you've been planted with an expectation that you're going to grow and it's God doing something intentionally and it's by his word and it's by his predestinated plan but then I love how he finishes because he says the evening lights have been shining now the summer time is the only time when we get evening lights in the winter it goes down we don't get evening lights all we get is late afternoon lights but he says now we're in the time where the evening lights have been shining in other words we're in the summer in the late summer because that's what's required to ripen the Harvest that's what's required to bring Reit to its full maturity is to ripen in the presence of the Sun and so you need evening lights to do that you can't just have eight hours of sunshine to produce wheat you need the 12 and 14 hours of sunshine constant heat and warmth for it to come to its full potential so he says it's not just that you've got the power it's not just so you've been planted but now you've got the conditions to produce a mature bride everything that is needed is here already amen the sunshine is here the presence of the sun is here to ripen a bride what's he saying he's saying you're in the Harvest Time so start looking for a harvest start looking for maturity start looking for the things that are expected of a mature bride that's going to go in a Rapture don't act like children don't be caught up in the things that a childish believer is caught up in but be mature Believers in Christ step into your position be expecting him to do everything that he said he was going to do don't hold back there's nothing left amen we read in Romans 8 before it says for the earnest expectation of the creature of the creation that's this earth and its elements and systems the expectation of the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creation the creature the creation itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God but before the Earth can do it the children of God have to get it remember for the Earth can be given Liberty then the children of God have to have their Liberty we come first the Earth comes second he says for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now the whole earth is waiting for us to finish our part so that it can be restored back to its eating condition we're the first ones that have to come to our place then God takes us up and there's a tribulation then he gives us a new Heaven and new earth after the Millennium in these things it says but not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we groan ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of the body so our Prophet comes and he tells us it's manifesting time it's Harvest Time It's the final age for the Gentiles and everything's wrapping up and God has done everything he said he would do listen if you think he hasn't done it then you only have to look at the life of that seven churches Messenger to see that that was the wave sheath that God was coming down and dwelling in flesh the same way he did in the book of Acts and if that anointing was for him then that anointing is for everyone that receives the prophet's name because we receive the same promise as the prophet does we get the same reward that the prophet does which is what God dwelling in flesh yet again and we get the Overcomers reward as well that we get to sit with him in his throne but brother random saying listen everything's here everything's here and now it's the time of manifestation it's the time to wrap things up in other words God's not holding back anymore he's holding back wrath but he's not holding back himself because he's got to get us out of the earth so that he can judge the Earth and bring us back to the full eating condition amen Luther was held back Luther only had a revelation of the Holy Ghost for justification that was a work of the Holy Spirit but it was not the fullness of it and then Wesley comes behind him and he builds on top of that and he gets what a second revelation of sanctification but God was holding things back because it wasn't time yet and then Pentecost comes through Azusa and they get what a revelation of the gifts of the Spirit but that wasn't everything and they stopped there and then God brings a prophet messenger and he says you've got the gifts but you need the giver now because the giver is the seal the gifts are not the seal The Giver is the seal and you need the Seal of the Holy Ghost on your entire body and so then he says now that that's given everything's taken it's it it's done it's over with everything you have need of is done there amen the word was restored to its fullness and that gave us the fullness of the Holy Ghost to have what produced the full word in each and every one of our Lives amen when the word comes to its fullness then the bride can come to its fullness that's why we need a restoring Angel we needed an Elisha and Elijah to come again and restore us back to that original faith that original Faith requires the original word it requires the fullness of the word but I would say this he says now that's the age we're living in right now the seventh Church age now it's all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end he says another comeback it's a restoration now if you take Luke the 17th chapter in the 30th verse he says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man begins to reveal himself what is revealed he says make his revelation of what he is in this day reveal it out to the people the word that's made known to the day he says reveal to the People by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit making that Jesus live among us and the problem is we keep pointing to a prophet and we don't see it in ourselves because he's only the chief offering he's only the wave offering he's only the first fruits and that's got to continue all the way through the age because we're all part of the same body we're all under the same fullness of the Holy Spirit anointing under that restored word amen but the thing is he's saying this and the question that we have is how does he do it how does God do it how does he bring us to a place where we are the manifested sons and daughters of God what is the order of it what is it that we're that God does throughout this thing to bring us into that fullness of adoption and I want to be very careful with this because we've been preaching from seeds because that's the way Jesus did it that's the way our Prophet did it but when it comes to the the new birth and adoption you can't do that with seeds because seeds aren't human seeds are only a type but they're not a perfect type you're not a seed you're a human a seed when it's laying in the ground doesn't have thoughts it doesn't have a spirit it doesn't have a mind it doesn't have emotions it's just dead and dormant and that's really reflective of our soul but we've got a whole body around us that can think and act and talk and listen and do all these things and so we can't preach about adoption or the manifestation of the sons of God purely from seeds we'll touch on seeds throughout it but we've got a lot more going on in us than a seed does and so you've got to step back now into the way that Paul preaches it and even what we see here in Ezekiel and these different things so we have to well I preach the new birth as it occurs in a human rather than just how it does in a seed because brother Brown would talk about that moment of quickening but he wouldn't talk about all that stuff that happens before it necessarily in a seed it's tougher to type it that way so I'm not leaving the seed thing behind we're going to refer to it at times but when it when it comes to the order of life when it comes to the order of spiritual life of becoming a child of God we've got to go back to how we are as humans not just as seeds in that way we've got to treat ourselves that way because that's where God works with us he works with us as humans not just as a plant life amen brother Brian would say this he says this is the way it is with our road to heaven we have our own thinking but if we use that we're going to find ourselves all together wrong all racked up somewhere but if we'll take the way that God has marked out for us we'll arrive there just as sure as anything because God has a way now let's go back to some of God's way in a simple form that people would know he said did you ever notice the little chicken trying to get to this earth what does he do on the inside of that shell he stands there and beats away at that shell until he gets himself free what is it he says God's provided way he had a bill before he was ever able to peep on the shell he had a bill because God provided him a bill to work in God's provided way before he ever became a true chicken he had a bill before he's ever got real life he has a bill and that bill is required for him to come to life in other words there's something built into him to allow him to come to life he says oh he's a lovely father see he makes everything just right first he had to grow a bill on the bird the foul that's born inside of an egg he's got to make a way for him to follow the provided way to get out see how God does he makes a provided way and the only thing we have to do is follow his instructions and we come out just exactly right always every time it's simple follow what the word says He says yes sir he picks his way out because he is coming God's provided way now I want you to notice something here because the chicken starts as an egg and that egg is germinated by the rooster and an egg that was dormant that wasn't alive because we eat them all the time those are dead eggs but if the rooster germinates it it's it's not alive but it starts to grow there is life that is working within it but it's not yet alive as we would say it's just a bunch of cells and nutrients inside of it it's an animal seed if we can put it that way but once it's germinated those cells start to pull apart and split and divide but they're also joining as they do it but it's still inside the egg it isn't anything yet it's not even a chicken yet but when the male germinates that egg it starts to pull itself into proper shape everything that chicken will be is in the egg and what happens is when it's germinated it starts to pull itself together to produce a chicken right it starts to it doesn't look like a mature chicken inside there but it starts to resemble a chicken right it gets a beak it gets a head it gets little feet with tiny little claws on it and the prophet says now notice before it's even able to pip its way out of the shell it has what's required to get it out of the shell he says it's God provided way it's it's a what they call it an egg tooth and an egg tooth is is just a a little pointy thing at the end of the beak and it's a temporary horny cap on the chick's upper beak that serves for pipping its way through the shell and it usually dries and falls off within 18 hours after the chick hatches so it's something that's given for a very specific amount of time to do a very specific work and then it's not needed anymore but God has provided every single chicken with that means of getting out of that egg and remember brother Brandon would say if you try and break that eight that that egg open to get that chick out it will die because you're not doing it God's provided way and you talk about Hothouse Christians and and people that you just gotta hug them and love them and do everything all the time and they can't stand on their own two feet they can't stand the storms of life they can't be out in natural rainfall they can't take the heat they can't take the drought they can't take the storms of life because they haven't come to a proper New Birth they're just hot house plants that's the way a chicken is if you break that egg open it will die because that strength that it builds up to break out is what keeps it going for the first little while it has to break out it has to do the work amen notice the chicken has life in that shell but it's not living in the way that a chicken is supposed to yet amen it's alive in the egg but it can die in the egg if it doesn't pip its way out if it gives up it will die in the egg and that chicken never truly lived it had life but it never truly lived the way that a chicken's supposed to him and it's a work of Life inside of it but it's not yet Fully Alive a human baby's inside the mother and from the moment of conception it has life but it is yet not alive it is not a living soul but it is alive inside of the mother but there's a process inside of it and that certainly doesn't give us the right to kill it the way that the world talks about because we know that God has predestinated us before we ever come out who and what we're going to be that means he looks at us as alive in there but as we would understand it that baby in there is not a living human it's not doing anything on its own yet it is completely dependent on everything around it it's got to come out and live on its own for us to say it's truly alive amen but the point here is that God has a provided way to come to life and there's an order to coming to life and then there's a way of being conceived and there's a way of growing and maturing into a spiritual child and then there's a way to be born and it's a process and it's not something that happens in a single moment we look at it at a baby being born into this world and we say well it's born when it comes out of the mother but the birth is a process and the process started nine months ago when Mommy and Daddy conceive that child in the womb of the mother and then for nine months that child is going through a birth process that starts with what growth inside to look and and shape and form itself into the shape of a human and then at the very end it comes out as a human and becomes a living soul and we say well that's when it was born but its birth started nine months ago it's a process amen and that's one of the things we've learned even in this message is that the Rapture is a process because Enoch walked and walked and walked and then one day he started walking up and then that was it but there was a process to the Rapture and so the new birth is a process we look at it and we say well when you get the Holy Ghost that's the new birth but there's so much has usually happened before that and that's what we're going to talk about over the next few Services because otherwise we'll get to the place where we're looking for this instantaneous thing and we don't realize that this is a work of God it's a process of the holy spirit in our life before he even gives us the Holy Spirit itself that's what's going on inside of us so let's take it back to Ezekiel 36 here to our opening scripture it says for I will take you from among the Heathen gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land that's the calling out of the people that's the choosing of God in verse 24. that is God's predestination saying I'm going to do it and that is the start of any new birth that is the start of the new birth process is God has called you God has predestinated God has put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he says I'm going to make sure that they produce the word that's the start of it all he says then I'll sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your idols and I will cleanse you that's the cleaning of the People by what clean water pure water it's untainted it's unpolluted it's filtered of any contaminants it's natural it's original it's perfect and it does a perfect work of cleaning I saw this video where a guy said he's talking about Doctrine he says well it doesn't really matter you know people say well it doesn't matter if the doctrine isn't quite right and so he took a clean glass of water and then he took a glass of water from the toilet and he took one drop out of that toilet water and he put it in that pure glass of water and he said who wants to drink that glass of water now with one drop of toilet bowl water nobody wants to drink the pure water anymore because that little bit ruins it that's why we needed a restoring Angel that's why we needed a restoring message we needed a pure word for a pure anointing to produce a pure word result and then after that he says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you in heart of Flesh so a new heart and a new spirit are given to the people and in doing so he takes away that original Stony heart our natural heart is not tender towards God God has to give us something that is tender towards him that's open to receiving the word itself and he says I'm going to give you a fleshy heart a soft heart something that's malleable something that that doesn't just turn away from the things of God but rather it's drawn towards them and that's still a work of God that's still a work of the Holy Spirit but it's not the Holy Spirit and then he says I'm going to give you a new spirit and we'll talk about this a little later where brother Brown would say listen you needed a new spirit because you can't even get along with yourself with your original Spirit he says so you need a new spirit just so you can get along with the Holy Spirit and then he says and then I will put my spirit within you NOW Watch What Happens because everything that happens after this could not be possible beforehand once he puts his Spirit within you it says and cause you to walk in my statutes in other words to live the word he says and you shall keep my judgments and you'll do them holy holy holy unto the Lord none of this is possible with a new heart and a new spirit but once he put his Spirit within you now you can actually live the full word he says and you shall dwell in the land that I gave your father so he says I'll return you to your possession and you shall be my people and I will be your God so he restores your position and he restores your relationship now I'm going to take us to the prophet's message to explain this because he was the one that needed to clarify this because there was a lot of Confusion And even today I can say we're mixed up inside the message many times because we've gotten to the place where people are saying if you accept the message you've got the Holy Ghost and they're sitting in church and they're nodding their head to what comes over they're giving an intellectual acknowledgment to it but they aren't living it and if you can't live it then you haven't accepted it brother Bob says if you truly believe it you'll do it not just nod your head not just sit in church and say amen Amen brother but you'll actually live it amen so you're walking all over the scriptures when you say this idea that if you accept the message for your day you've got the Holy Ghost because it's not just accepting it it's acting on it you got to live it not just say it's true because there's lots of things Jesus said that they had to acknowledge were true and yet they could not accept the person of the word and that's what we've got to do this is not a message that is written on uh on books or it's in audio sermons but it's a bridegroom message that said come get ready for the bridegroom because he's coming and the message was to prepare you not to listen to a bunch of books or sermons but it was to accept the bridegroom that was coming behind the message amen the message is not a book the message is a person the word is a person it's not just written because if all we've got is the messages or the tapes of the scripture alone this is what kills because there's no life in you to do it but if you accept the person of it that's when you've got the message that's when you truly believe the message because what it's living inside of you it's not just an intellectual Doctrine but it's a Living Word it's a living message inside of you listen to what the prophet of God says he says that's what we need today is experiences plural of the new birth what we need today is experiences of the new birth he says now I want you to watch the order that Ezekiel brought it in he said I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit in you he says I want you to watch there's three of it a new heart I'll take the old Stony heart away that's the old different heart you have and I'll give you a new spirit he says now many times there's been a terrible mistake the people have thought sometimes that the new spirit was the Holy Spirit but it isn't it's a new spirit why you couldn't even get along with yourself with your old Spirit how are you going to get along with the Holy Ghost God had to give you a new spirit so you could get along with his spirit he says a new heart a heart of Flesh so you'll receive it then a new heart spirit in that heart and I'll put my spirit in that you see new heart new spirit and my spirit three things he spoke of now many times we try to make that thing just say well as soon as you get the new spirit you quit your listen what the new spirit does you quit you're stealing you quit you're lying things like that you say oh Hallelujah I got it and you find out the first time anyone crosses your path a little bit oh mercy what a difference sure you blow up like a frog eating buckshot frogs don't eat Buckshot very well it just weighs them down until they explode he says but let me tell you brother that's the reason you never got God's spirit that's true you say oh he stepped on my toe I'll not just put up with that all right that shows what you got in there that's true he says I'll put a new spirit in you and then I'll put my spirit in you now the heart is in the center of the emotions of the human being your heart is the middle of you that's exactly right so God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new heart and puts his spirit in the middle of the new spirit he says now it's all just exactly like the mainspring in a famous watch you see they got a little click over here working a click over here working it's little wheels are turning he says but it's all controlled by a mainspring now today most of us don't have an appreciation for a watch anymore and if we have a watch it's like what I've got it's a it's a smart watch it's an electronic watch it's a digital watch and so we don't even understand what brother Brad is talking about but I love watches and I've got a mechanical watch and it's an amazing thing to see how these things work inside of them but before watches were electronic before they had batteries they were purely mechanical and they had all these different ways to make the watch keep time and if you look at one of these movements an automatic movement this is what it looks like under the face all you would often see would be the two hands moving around three hands moving around hours minutes and seconds you see that moving around but underneath this is what it takes to keep time accurately and it's a whole system and it's got levers and it's got Gears and it's got shafts and it's got Springs and it's got Jewels for things to wait on and rest on and turn smoothly and all these different things and no matter how and it based on how much money you were willing to spend they could make a watch that didn't just tell time but it could tell time in three different time zones it could give you the phases of the Moon it could have a calendar on it and they could build it all into this and they'd run it by a single thing they'd have all these fancy movements and some of these watches now are worth over millions of dollars millions of dollars for something that tells time in a couple different fancy ways purely mechanical no batteries and what is it that did it brother Branham calls it the mainspring and so what we have here on the right hand side is all the parts of a typical automatic watch and you say wow that's a lot of stuff he's saying this is the this is the what a Christian believer looks like this is what's inside of us is a bunch of different things but he says the most important thing to have there is a mainspring because the mainspring is the source of power for everything inside of that watch you have these tiny little fine gears and these tiny little jeweled movements and all of these different things but everything is driven by the mainspring and unless you have a mainspring there it will never do its job you can have every part of what it takes to be a believer except the Holy Ghost and you'll never live the life now if you look at that picture you'll see that all those things that are in there and there's actually a way to make that clock work that watch work without a mainspring and you know what it is it's on the side of your watch you have this little thing called the stem and if you just take that stem and you turn it you can make that watch tell time but you know what it's reliant on your timing your power your focus how well you can keep time on your own and let me ask you how many of us can keep time for 60 seconds without another reference we can't do it but yet there's a way for us to live the Christian walk on our own and that's we just keep turning the stem doing it our own way by our own power but what happens is the time gets off really quickly doesn't it it's not about the ability to tell time it's about the ability to tell time accurately you know what they say a broken clock is right twice a day and what happens is people will see somebody right twice and wrong all the time and they'll say they've got a gift my cousin sent me a a prophetic message from a guy he he follows yesterday and I was studying but I said you know what I'm going to listen to it So I listened to it and you know what he said two things right in about 15 things wrong and it was completely messed up but they'll focus on what he gets right and they'll forget about all the thing that he gets wrong inside of there because he was focused on he was talking about the The Jezebel government and you know what it is he calls The Jezebel government as the Democrats as somehow God's government is the is the Republicans down in the states I told the guy I said listen this is all Satan's kingdom there's no party that's affiliated with God God's not even in it Satan has it all the way till the tribulation so so why are we talking about a jezebel Kingdom I said America is going on it's done it's finished she's already turned down God she's Bound for judgment but he'll focus on what the things that do come for right and ignore all the things that are wrong why because he's convinced that that man's a prophet but that's not what we're looking for we're looking for something that tells the time right all the time that's why we need a Vindicated Prophet not just a man that says he's a prophet amen but you can have all the pieces together and you can sit there and you can turn your watch and you know what sometimes you'll do just okay people say yep that's a real believer but there's going to come a time you got to sleep you got to eat and you got to take your hand off that stem and all of a sudden your life falls apart because it was you doing it all along all of a sudden you're saying whoa what happened to that why it was you doing it not the mainspring of the Holy Spirit doing it amen Paul would say this in second Corinthians he says we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us listen we know our own frailties as humans but sometimes what happens is we get into our Christian walk and all of a sudden we think that makes us superhuman it doesn't make us superhuman it makes God Supernatural in US that's it when I was in Edmonton brother Nathan Erickson said something I'm going to preach on this in in the future Lord willing he says remember you are the mask he is the actor he's doing it you're just the shell you're just the thing that's hiding him you're not doing it it's him doing it inside of you and that's what produces the works of God inside of our life amen listen to this Proverbs 14 12 says there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death I was listening to that message the guy this morning and brother Branham talks about how he he married you know after his wife died and he went he married Mita and he said you know I kind of cheated on my wife he says I took her to a place where I could go hunting for our for our honeymoon and he's talking about how he's told his wife he says I'm going to go out there and I'm going to shoot a bear I'm going to shoot a deer I'm going to bring it back and we'll have our meat for the year and it's going to be wonderful and she says sure go do it that sounds wonderful so she's in the cabin with Billy Paul no way of taking care of herself and he says I'm just going to go out and come back and brother Bram says I'm a guide I'm a certified guide I know where I am I know what I'm doing he says and I knew I could never get lost he says and I went out and I said I started to track there's a puma he just saw a flash of it and he started trying to track it couldn't find it it finally took to the trees he said bro I couldn't track it anymore so then I turned around and he says I whiffed a bear I smelt a bear so then I started following that bear and I stepped out and then a big a big deer jumped out of a bush it was a big buck he said exactly what I want boom shot it he dressed it cleaned it all up hung it up in a tree he says and then I looked around and I was surrounded by fog no reference for anything he can't see anything and he says well this is no problem I'm a guide I know what I'm doing I'll just walk back to the cabin and he starts to walk and he walks for about 34 30 or 45 minutes he says now where was my turn off where where was I supposed to turn off I haven't seen it yet he says and I came right around and there's my deer hanging up in the tree and he's come in a total Loop all the way back to where he started he says okay I can't do that again and he starts out walking he's looking for his turn off and preaching he says this is starting to look familiar and boom he comes right back and there's this deer hanging in the in the tree again he says I was on what the Indians call a death walk where you don't realize you're making a circle and the entire time even though you're experienced even though you're focusing on not making that mistake he says I was turning in circles and I was on a Death March and brother Bram says I thought I was too good of a guide to be lost and brother Brown says I can't make this mistake after the second time he says and I came back again he he said I can't do a third Loop and then he went and did a third Loop why because he was limited by his own power strength knowledge sense of direction and in a total fog nobody can do it then he says I tried to Bluff myself and said you're not lost he says but you can't Bluff it he says your inner conscience tells you you're wrong prophet of God giving us an example for our life and he says but in the background something kept saying I'm a very present help in time of trouble and he didn't listen and he didn't listen and he didn't listen and finally he nothing was working and the fog was worse than ever and he couldn't get a reference for to give him a direction and he prayed and he said Lord if that's you help me he says I don't know if that's you or not but if it's you you help me find my way out and you know what he did after he prayed he said I picked a direction to the best of my knowledge and I started walking and you know what he said if I'd have kept going in that direction I'd have ended up in Canada after prayer and asking for leadership he's still to the best of his knowledge went in the completely wrong direction why he's still in his power he's still in his thinking he's still in his experience he says but as I started walking he said something tapped me on the shoulder like the hand of a man in his sincerity he still was going wrong but he had prayed and he said Lord I need you so he started on a road and it was the wrong road but the Lord touched him on the shoulder and he says and he says when I turn to look he says there was a hole in the fog and six miles away he could see Hurricane Mountain which is where he needed to go he said if I can get to Hurricane Mountain there's a telephone pole up there he says and I helped the guy put a line from there all the way down to his cabin so he could call his wife when he was at the cabin he said so I could get to Hurricane Mountain I could find that wire up there and I could follow it all the way back to the cabin and he said I had to go up over Hills and Bluff some mountains and everything to get there but he says for that one moment through six miles of fog a hole appeared and God showed me the way I had to go and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and then he says as I got close he says I had to keep my hand up what is it it's not on Me Lord he's walking in surrender still I'm going the direction you told me to go he says because I had to keep my hand up so that it would hit the telephone wire that we'd strung he says and once I hit that he says I was never going to let it go and he said I'd have my rifle in one hand and this hand up and then I'd switch over he says I got to the place where I could barely keep it up he said and every time I switch he says I have to walk back a few steps to make sure I hadn't missed it in the switch he said because I couldn't miss that lifeline he said everything that matters to me is in that cabin and without me they're going to die she doesn't even know how to start a fire what is it we get our hands in it it's the ways of death every single time I don't care how experienced you are I don't care how long you've been serving the lord I don't know I don't care how long you've been in this message without that mainspring we're gonna fall by the wayside and we're gonna be wrecks on the side of the road remember I said earlier in the series I said brother Branham said this is why people are wrecks on side of the road this is what we're talking about people that think they've come all the way and they've only come up two-thirds of the way and they still don't have that mainspring of the Holy Ghost in their life amen Paul would talk about this no let me let me see this brother Brown said if you don't want to get wrecked up in life you quit pretending to be a Christian he says because you're going to find yourself wrecked up out here somewhere he says yes you come through God's provided way of approach what does it mean to pretend wasn't meant to pretend to be a Christian it means to rely on yourself to live the word and produce Christ rely on your own thoughts your own strengths your own gifts your own abilities all these different things and if we do that we're headed for a life of constant frustration Paul talks about it in Romans 7 and this is Paul's personal life before he got the Holy Ghost Paul speaking from experience when he talks about this he says I find then a law that when I would do good Evil's present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law of my members in my body warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so he says I've got the right intentions I've got the right thoughts but when it comes time to actually do it I keep falling flat on my face he says o Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death you know who else is called wretched laodicea the laodicean condition is that they're wretched but they don't even know it Paul at least knew it Paul at least knew it but in laodicea she thinks herself to be rich in natural and spiritual ways but this is Paul's mentality before he got the Holy Ghost before he got knocked off his high horse on the road to Damascus and it what is it he was so self-righteous and yet he was persecuting the true church but remember when he says who art thou to the pillar of fire he says I am Jesus whom thou persecute us and then he says Paul it's hard to kick against the pricks because God knew that Paul was confessing outwardly what I'm a perfect man according to the law but inside his conscience was bothering him because he knew he wasn't living it exactly the way he told everyone he was remember Paul would say you know I speak as a foolish man no I speak foolishly I speak according to the flesh that there was none like me there was none like me nobody lived the way I lived I was of I was I lived the life of a Pharisee better than the Pharisees did I was the best of the best when it came to being a Christian to becoming a Believer and yet then the Holy Ghost knocks him off of that that horse it says it's hard to kick against the Pricks Paul your inner conscience has been telling you you aren't what you think you are and there's something wrong that's going on remember brother Bram says you can't Bluff it when your conscience says you ain't got it you ain't got it and you need to settle that and anchor it in your soul amen but I want to take it to the New Testament the Old Testament kind of simultaneously here to just break down this bit of Ezekiel 36 for the last bit of the service he says now I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land so he's going to take he's going to gather and he's going to bring into it's the three works of Grace if we could put it that way but consider what those condition those people were in when he took him out of the Heathen lands what took him into Heathen lands Disobedience to the word idolatry everything they did wrong they were still doing wrong when he calls them back that's the grace of God that's the predestination of God is that when he calls them back to their land they're still in the condition that they left it but yet God says my word won't return to me void I'll take you in whatever condition you're in and I'm going to clean you up so that you become the word that I spoke about right they're no more a child of God when he starts to pull them back than they were then he drove them out when he let them you know be taken by their enemies in these things now Romans 8 we read this last service says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose remember we talked about what he said in Jeremiah he says for I know my thoughts towards thee that they are of good and not of evil so the thoughts of God are what bring things to good in our life and then he says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among burning Brethren so in other words that confirmation is a process it is not the work of a moment though the finished work happens often like this yet it is a work of time to bring you to what God has predestinated to and what he's calling you to it says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified so it's a work of God we see from start to finish all throughout but it's at the Finish point that we really come to that full New Birth brother Brown would say this he says now notice not only is the bride washed and forgiven but she is Justified did you ever try the word Justified to see what it means he says now for instance if brother green heard that I have been drinking I've been doing bad things and Benny found out that I didn't do it then he come and say I forgive you brother Branham now that doesn't make any sense does it and brother Brian says you forgive me I never did it what are you forgiving me about but that's not the condition of the Bride initially he says but if I'm guilty then I can be forgiven but I'm still not just because I did it he says but the word Justified is though you never done it at all Justified he says and then the blood of Jesus cleanses us from sin till it's put in the book of God's forgetfulness he's the only one that can do it so in other words when Satan comes knocking on your door reminding me of you of your past or your mistakes or your failures you say what are you talking about Satan I never did it because under justification you never did it remember we showed that time how how in a bank book you have debts and you have credits and if you scratch out the debt yet you know by looking at that book that you had a debt at some time but the blood of Jesus doesn't scratch it out it doesn't cover it up but it completely erases it so there is no evidence of your sin in the first place so when Satan comes saying you did this you say no you did it you did it because remember the Scene goes back on the one that caused it the one that laid the Trap it goes back to Satan all our sins are laid at his feet so when he says look what you did you say no I never did it you did it to me I'm covered by the blood there is therefore no sin there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen if you look at what the blood of Jesus does because remember they're under the blood of bulls and goats for so long and it never purged their conscience but under the blood of Christ now your conscience can be purged so that you can go before the throne of grace say I'm sorry Lord I didn't mean to do it will you forgive me and help me not to do it and you can walk out and never have your conscience bothered one more time about it I'm a testimony of it I'm a testimony of it my conscience bothers me no more after I've laid it at his feet because the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all of our sins John would say this it says the next day John said Jesus coming unto him and says Behold the Lamb of God which takes Away The Sins Of The World the blood of bulls and ghosts didn't take it away it covered it and the covering meant there was something under there but this perfect blood of Christ from the perfect sacrifice it takes it away and so there's nothing even to see anymore there's no evidence of it anymore it's buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness and the sign says no fishing remember that for your brother and sister the next time they do something wrong amen you don't drag something out from under the blood that God has already covered brother Graham says you do that you're responsible for it amen God help us to remember it let's be gracious towards our brother and sisters amen but in Ezekiel we see a calling prophesied but that was not the time of fulfillment but then we see in Romans we see that calling being fulfilled Ezekiel said God's going to call you and then Paul says God's already called you and he points rightly all the way back to before the foundation of the world see ezekiel's pointing to the time of his fulfillment and Paul's saying yes it's the time fulfillment but he actually did it way before you ever came on this Earth and that was the time where he called you but now is the time for it to happen amen that first bit this first bit of justification is always by faith because you've got nothing to do with it there is nothing you can do to justify yourself before God there's nothing you can do to make yourself more acceptable there's nothing you can do to make yourself more holy it is absolutely the work of the blood of Jesus Christ it's the finished work of Calvary and until you come to that place Satan will beat you up through your conscience and your memory for the rest of your life absolutely absolutely I've got family members that are in that where they can't get past their own conscience because they don't know what it means to be justified they don't understand that Christ paid for those sins and it's not by your actions you're getting in but it's by his faith through Grace in the holy spirit that you're going to make it all the way through you can't do a thing so stop trying to do it live your life according to his word as best you can but don't think that's what's going to make you acceptable in this site amen we'll see what makes you acceptable we'll see what makes you holy in these things but notice justification your sins aren't attributed to you but you're still dirty you're still dirty you've still got habits you've still got friendships you shouldn't have you still got demonic influences in your life you're listening to the wrong things you're looking at the wrong things you're saying the wrong things even amen so but you're in a transforming process and you've got to start dirty to finish clean if you convince yourself that you're clean to start then what do you need God for you've got to say I'm dirty and because this is a process don't just say well I was dirty when I got baptized but now there's never anything that he has to work with me in listen he's still working on me so okay there's four of us that are you still working on this morning five six seven there we go we got our hands up don't sit there and say just because I'm a Child of God that he's not still working sanctification goes on your entire life at least it is for me every day every week every month God is taking things out why because he's got to have room to add things in and there's some things that you have to be cleaner to be used for than others listen if I'm washing my car the bucket doesn't have to be that clean God's using you to wash a car your life can be a certain way but he's asking you to give people a drink of cold water Your Vessel has to be a whole lot cleaner than the one that's used for washing the car there are stages of sanctification it is going on constantly in our lives so what you can't do is sit there and say no no no even if you've got the Holy Ghost I don't need any more work he's always working on his bride until we go in a Rapture that's when it's fully done and until then he's constantly working in our lives amen so we've got to be honest about ourselves and say he's still working on me because if we get to the place where we don't have anything that he's working on we ought to be going in a rapture but if we're honest we'll see there's things that he's trying to work on in our life but it's an arrogant spirit it's a prideful spirit it's a religious spirit that says the word is for everybody else Pitchfork religion remember brother Steve Clark said well that's for sister Justine who's smiling at me right now and oh look brother Lloyd came here I hope brother John gets him on this do you guys know what brother Lloyd's been doing brother John pin him to look get him brother John no no no no no no Lord be it unto me amen let him walk to my door let him sit at my table I don't want sister Amber to be the only one that's getting everything I want something Lord feed me change me correct me draw me pull me change me bring your light into my life where I haven't had it before amen what did he say he says after I do that after I call you after I justify you he says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean that's his word not my word we can feel dirty sometimes we can but he says you're clean he makes us acceptable I don't make myself acceptable when he says I'm clean or clean every wit but what did he say to Peter he says listen you still have to wash your feet he says you're clean every whip but you still gotta wash your feet he says and if you don't wash your feet you have no part of me Peter you're constantly walking through a dirty World some of it's going to get on you so don't worry about having to get washed up on a regular basis that's why we read our Bibles that's why we come to church is to keep ourselves clean by the washing of Water by the word which is what we're going to talk about he says and what will that water do it will take from you all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you what is it habits false religion and false spirituality it's all going to be wiped away First Corinthians 6 11 says this and such were some of you such for some of you but ye are washed such are some of you such are all of us amen you were this but now you're saying your wash you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God so catch us though it's a work of the Holy Spirit it is not the Holy Spirit itself but it is the work of the holy spirit that initial sanctification okay that's a big distinction as we go through the serious series is to differentiate between the work of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit indwelling itself because they are two different things and they happen at two different times as we go through this we'll show you by the scriptures amen but then he would go to Ephesians 5 and say husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it how with the washing of Water by the word brother I would say this he says he the bridegroom took away your shame have you felt shame lately you don't have to feel it you don't have to feel shame he took your shame and listen he was naked he was beaten he was Bloody he was punched he was torn open in front of everybody that's as shameful as I can think about he did that so that you don't have to have shame this morning you say Lord you paid that price help me not to feel it he says and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said the anointed bridegroom which foreordained you has washed you by the washing of the water he says by the church that doesn't sound right does it you might find that in the almanac but it's not in God's Bible he says it's by the washing of the Water by the word he says it's in the word see you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it in the beginning he says this is my message to the church now this is November 25th 1965. this is one month before he dies and he says this is my message now we've heard the sea the seals are open brother John the Mysteries have been revealed we've this is the invisible Union message we've heard Christ is a mystery of God revealed we've heard all of these amazing things he says this is my message to the church now you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every Tittle then you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God that's where you're standing today because if you don't believe that then how are you going to walk into adoption how are you going to walk into a Rapture in a resurrection how are you going to walk into the manifestation of the sons of God if you think you're no good you're good because he said you are virtuous you are spotless you are white you are washed you are free of wrinkles better than the Nigerians can do for the Kings he tells me they do white shirts better than anyone else God does it better than even the Nigerians he says you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word now there's three things going on there he says you've got to be born by the spirit you've got to have the Holy Ghost inside of you you've got to be washed in the blood of Jesus Christ you've got to accept the finished work of Calvary and you got to believe every word of God you do all of those he says you stand as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect one month before he dies the prophet of God says if you're doing this you are perfect but let me tell you even if you weren't doing it then even if you're not doing it today you're perfect because he's for ordained you he's predestinated you to perfection in Christ Jesus so sister Lydia is perfect just as perfect as sister Maureen is and little Jensen is potentially as perfect as brother Marcus brother Gerald if you're filled with the spirit washed in the blood and believe in every word amen but this the sanctification is a working of the Holy Spirit but you've got a part to play in sanctification because you got choices you know what you put your hand to you know what you put your eyes to you know what all of these different things you start to make choices in sanctification it's a working of the Holy Spirit to convict You by showing you in the word what you ought to do and what you ought not to do but you'll see here that there's a there's a gray area within this but this sanctification has a full body effect because we've got a full word we've got an open word to us but it's a process of time and that's why we have a word standard and not a church standard because there's things that I did when I was 25 that I don't do now and they were perfectly fine for me to do at 25 that they are definitely not fine for me to do now why because God is refining God is using me in a different way and there's things that I can't have in my life that weren't didn't have the the the effect that they would have today if I left them in my life why because I'm being used in a different way than I was 20 when I was 25 years old the scripture has lots of gray areas lots of gray areas Paul would talk about it he would say all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient now that doesn't mean that if the word says don't do it that it's lawful for you to do it that's not what he's saying but he's saying if there is nothing that forbids me to do it then I can do anything I want but he says all things are not expedient that word expedient means profitable in other words they don't add anything good to my life or anybody else's profitable in a in an eternal sense or a spiritual sense he says all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any that means you won't be controlled by anything what does this look like it looks like addiction or idolatry and really they're both the same thing right you either can't let it go put it down or can't quit it can't walk away or else you put it ahead of the word of God in your life and you put it ahead of God's Kingdom Purpose for you the easiest way to know when you're under an influence is whether or not you can walk away and stay away if you say Oh Brother John this is this is something I just do it for fun it's no big deal okay lay it down for a week and if you can't lay it down for a week then it's got you it's really easy to check it's really easy to check you think you've got control over your phone lock yourself out after 30 minutes and see if you're still going back to change that lock you think you can handle that site you can think you can handle that form you think you can handle that game you think you can handle that friendship say goodbye once and see if you keep going back and if it is you're under the power of something and it ain't the Holy Spirit check it up say if I've got control then I ought to be able to walk away at any time and not pick it up again very simple preaching to myself amen there's only one power we're supposed to be under and that's the power of the anointed word which is the holy spirit in our lives and let me tell you that will not share its Glory with anything else it won't share its time with anything else you do that and that Holy Spirit will draw away and then the ceiling starts to become like a a brass ceiling right and your prayers aren't going up and you can't feel the presence of God and you can't enter into worship why because you play something ahead of him and he'll wait for you to get sick and tired of that condition and to walk away and say Lord I need Deliverance because something else has a hold of me Paul will continue Romans 8 he says and whom he justified them he also glorified he says now we've read that before that glorification we'll read it again in future services but that glorification represents adoption and adoption is the final result of the new birth amen but it comes at the end of the process of the new birth in part and it comes in fullness Paul says when we get our body changed that's the full adoption because that's when everything is pulled away that's when we get rid of the stinking sinful flesh that keeps keeps holding us up and keeps holding us back and causing us problems that's when we get that that's when we can be fully entrusted with everything but until that time there is an adoption process absolutely and we are placed positionally in the body of Christ absolutely as adopted Sons and Daughters of God but it's not the fullness of it but it is an adoption there's a trust in there that God has in it amen it's not at the end of our life or near the end of our life but that's the end of this process that we're talking about the order of life that coming to a new birth and we'll prove it in the scriptures as we go through he says and with all of that what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us in Ephesians 5 he says that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish his words not mine his process not mine his promise not mine his work not mine brother Brahm says this as we close he says and he has sent his transforming power to bring you out of this deformity of religion that you're in this deformity chaos that we're in God has sent his transforming power his word Vindicated proven to bring you out of this religious deformity of ignorance that you're walking in naked blind miserable and don't know it he says think of it friends you know God sent his transforming power to fulfill his word and change the whole body of Sarah and Abraham he said transformed an old man and an old woman why because he took pity on them because he promised he would do it because he promised he would do it he says and what God promises to do that he'll do he says any perverted thing God can't do nothing with it but he will keep his word and he'll send his spirit I the Lord have planted it I will water it day and night unless some should pluck it from my hands the Bible says that he says o wandering Stars he's talking to the congregation you with the desire in your heart you've got to have it or you wouldn't be sitting here this morning you wouldn't be in those churches and auditoriums and things you're in out across the land if something capital S something didn't bring you in there he says some person spoke to you he says don't go any further there is a washing of the Water by the word that will make you white as snow he says o sons of God listen don't stay in that deformity come out of it amen God bless you let's stand amen I need another 40 minutes or an hour to get through that new heart and new spirit portion and whatnot so we'll save that for Wednesday Lord willing but I'm trying to get you to see there is a process to this don't get frustrated if you don't have the Holy Ghost yet don't get frustrated because you don't have it recognize that there is a path there's a process there's a road to all of this and he shows us this clearing that clearly in his word it's not just a Doctrine it's not just an idea we've made up to kind of keep you going until you get the real thing but rather God works with us in the in the way that he says in his word amen listen we weren't it wasn't always obvious that we were children of God some of us were born and raised in a Christian home in this message and whatnot but some of us weren't and some of us went out and came back and some of us have stayed in all the way through and yet through it all we were children of God and we are children of God so don't look at it and say well it's not as far as you know I'm not as far as I thought I would be I was talking I think with brother Joel the other day we were talking about where we're at in our lives and you know when I got to to high school and I was in or you know in the second school I guess it wasn't really high school I was in seventh grade and you look at the 12th graders and you're like they're so cool they've got it all put together and you know they're big they got their muscles they got their facial hair you know they're fast they're agile they can shoot way better than me you say when I get there I'm going to be just like them and you know what you get there and you are just like them but it's no big deal because you've been growing you've been growing into maturity and the thing is we want to go from a grade seven to grade 12 like that and guess what we go through it so gradually that half the time we don't even realize what happened all the way along until we go and we can shoot a puck 80 miles an hour as before we used to do 40. now we can go roof Daddy on the net and it's no big deal right Jensen we can put it in the corners no problem why because we grew throughout it but if we got stuck on what we weren't it had ruined us in the process of becoming what we ought to be amen don't get frustrated where you're at say Lord I'm in the process even if you got the Holy Ghost we're still in a process we're still growing we're still maturing we're laying in the presence of the sun there's still things that are going on and that means there's things that dine out I said it before with the wheat in its final stage of maturity everything else dies there's no life there's no more nutrients coming up through the bottom it's just laying in the presence of the Sun and it's drawing out that perfect shape that perfect form that perfect seed so that what was put into the ground is showing exactly at the top of that weed at the end and it only comes by laying in the presence of God amen let's stay there let's stay in the presence of God let's stay in his word and say Lord let it have its perfect work in our lives amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how beautiful it is to read Lord that you've made a way you made a path you've given a process Lord You've you put inside us Lord the very things we need to come to life Lord and when your Holy Spirit crosses our path when your word moves our way Lord when you're we come into your presence or something quickens us and it starts a process to bring us back into your presence Lord to bring us back into your word Lord to produce the thing that was laying dormant inside of us all this time Lord may you give us rest in it nor may we seek may we press toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling Lord but not beat ourselves up when we don't quite have it Lord we then we don't quite see it Lord when we see that there's more Lord but it's not in us yet Lord may we understand your process is perfect your word is perfect your way is perfect your timing is perfect Lord You Hold Us in the palms of your hands and you won't let a single one of us go Lord encourage us Lord fill us with your spirit Lord fill us again with your spirit Lord make us Lord help us to live this life naturally Lord that you called us to live we pray Lord bless each one remembering those that are sick Lord those that aren't here today Lord pray and you'll be with them each one in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen that's I'm sorry I don't have the numbers today for the visual but it's I Lift Your Name no oh there we go yes Lord my heart can grow so far away and cold and yet for Me Your Love is still the the same oh Lord I've been my knees in I am fear of thee my hair bows down in reference to your name I I Lift Your Name your home holy name Jehovah God hello him the [Music] Great I Am the Risen land my car comfort [Music] and King Lord my heart's desire is to be filled with spirit and Fire my purposes to worship you alone so open up my soul to worship and adore to be a fragrance offer to your throne [Music] I Lift Your Name your home [Music] Jehovah God hello

you and then we're going to sing that song Winds of Faith 12 23. and we're going to sing that and I'm going to ask brother Kingsley to come and close in prayer at the end of this if he would remember the saints that are sick brother Chad brother Bob sister Brenda and then we've got the grand snot here today praying God's grace to them brother Emmanuel and the different ones pray for the service Wednesday pray for brother Andrew Glover amen we're looking for a wonderful time in the Lord especially for the young people but for each one of us amen amen the word is not just for for one group or one age or anything like that but it's for all of us amen we're gonna go we're going to pull we're gonna have a wonderful time and the Lord so remember that pray God's grace to us each one amen Winds of faith there [Music] roads that you may take this one one by side [Music] so take the word of God now but you see what you believe is what will be so set your wings to The Winds of faith you can fly in a higher place and do not struggle and it's by grace set your wings to the Winds of faith watch the Eagles in the Sky What's your what's your Mountain much too high speak the word of God and by Empire it will move or you will fly set your wings to The Winds of faith you can fly in a higher place do not struggle it's by Grace set your wings to The Winds of Faith so watch the Eagles in the sky he does not struggle he does not strive for the power that makes him right rise is already in the sky so set your way thanks to the Winds of faith you can fly in a higher place did I struggle it's my grace set your wings to The Winds of Faith to sold there for a sec you know I was reading he's got God God's got four anointings he's got a man Ox he's got an eagle and a lion do you know the Eagles at the end you can keep playing sister sorry the Eagles at the end and it's for a reason because this is the time of troubles this is a time of tribulations this is the time of the greatest difficulty this is the time when the earth is groaning we're back in a solemn condition but it's even worse than Sodom ever was and we're facing persecution we're facing difficulties in lives we're facing our own human frailties but this nature of an eagle is that it lets trouble lift it up because brother Brown says remember when that storm comes the eagle sets his wings into that storm and it carries him up to where there is no storm amen the nature of an eagle is to rise above it every other bird goes through it but the eagle uses it to rise above it because it can breathe at a higher place it can stay up there indefinitely buoyed by The Winds of everything that's going on around it and it'll take those and it'll lift it up that's how you know when you're an eagle is when the the the trials of Life aren't breaking you down but they're lifting you up they're drawing you up towards the God they're drawing you up into Heavenly places they're drawing you into the promise of your position in Christ and there you start to realize I meant to go over it I meant to stay above it even while it's going on yet I can be above it that my nature isn't bothered by it my nature actually uses it for its benefit rather than letting itself get beat up about it man we're going to sing that third verse says watch the eagle in the sky right he doesn't struggle he doesn't strive everything around him you could have a a force five hurricane underneath him and he just sits there and he just can ride it out and then we're in the time of a hurricane season coming up we're in a place where extreme weather is the norm and yet we go through it and it's no big deal to us why because we've got a nature that can handle it and it's the same for the believer when those times come and things aren't going the way you thought and it's not the way you you you saw it happening in your head and it's just not working out that way what do you do it lifts you up in the word closer to God and you say lord it's all in your hands you're giving me wings to fly so I'm Gonna Fly the claws are not for holding onto branches the claws are for food but the wings are to fly and I'm Gonna Fly Lord I'm gonna use this to draw me closer to you I'm going to get closer to where I'm supposed to be and stay away from this Earth where all the problems are amen let's sing this one more time as brother Kingsley comes to pray so watch the Eagles in the sky he does not struggle he does not strive for the power that makes him right is already in the skies so set your wings to The Winds of faith you can fly in a higher place so do not struggle it's by Grace set your wings to The Winds of faith [Music] thank you Hallelujah amen in Jesus name most gracious God we thank you for this day and for the word we
