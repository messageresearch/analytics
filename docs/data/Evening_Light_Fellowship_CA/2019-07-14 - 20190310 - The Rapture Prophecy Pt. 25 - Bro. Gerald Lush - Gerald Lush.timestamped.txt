[34:57] there
[34:59] [Music]
[35:07] amen praise the Lord
[35:10] [Music]
[35:29] I'd like to just give a testimony before
[35:31] I sing
[35:33] I've been pretty sick the past three
[35:35] weeks and I thought I was over it and
[35:38] then I kind of plunged down again and
[35:40] got pretty sick and you guys know my
[35:43] grandfather is a prayer warrior and I I
[35:45] try not to depend on him because I want
[35:49] to pray and have that faith myself and I
[35:53] was really sick of the other way and I
[35:56] was thinking about him and he called me
[35:58] I wasn't gonna call him
[36:02] he called me when I answered he
[36:04] immediately started rebuking the devil
[36:06] you know I was sick I think my family
[36:08] told them but um
[36:10] and I just heard a ball and I said I was
[36:13] just thinking about you and he called me
[36:16] and so he he prayed with me I had a
[36:19] coffin was feelin sick all day and
[36:22] that nausea left me immediately but I
[36:26] was still coughing really hard night I
[36:28] can ask Paul I've kept him up a lot at
[36:31] night but I felt like I couldn't take a
[36:33] breath I was coughing so hard and so I
[36:36] was laying in bed and I leaned over to
[36:37] text him and he called me again I hadn't
[36:40] even texted him yet and he called me and
[36:42] he started crying and he said that for
[36:44] the past hour this was an hour later he
[36:46] said for the past hour that
[36:48] the Lord had been pressing it on his
[36:50] heart and he pushed it away and the Lord
[36:52] would press it on his heart and he would
[36:53] push it away and he said the Lord told
[36:56] me to tell you though say Lord Jesus
[36:58] Christ makes you well and after that my
[37:01] cough left and so this song came on my
[37:04] heart the next day and I
[37:07] really wanted to sing it I was listening
[37:09] to brother Burley Williams and he was
[37:11] saying that when you testify a
[37:14] trial hits you right after to test your
[37:17] faith and
[37:18] today I'm coughing a lot more than I
[37:20] have but I'm gonna sing it anyway
[37:22] because I was gonna sing it Wednesday
[37:23] and Church got cancelled and I wasn't
[37:25] gonna sing it today because I hadn't
[37:27] practiced but I felt really pressed to
[37:29] sing it so it may not be one for the CDs
[37:32] dad but
[37:33] I'm gonna sing it anyway I think all of
[37:36] you know it so just join with me cuz
[37:38] it's just a testimony it said it's to
[37:40] worship Him and I
[37:43] asked my grandfather cuz I was feeling
[37:46] pretty low that night I said how do you
[37:47] pray the way that you do
[37:54] God hears them every time I
[37:58] said how do you do it cuz I had been
[38:01] prayin all day and nothing came to me
[38:05] until he called me and prayed for me and
[38:07] he said honey I just believe
[38:11] it's as simple as I just believe and he
[38:15] said that God told him a long time ago
[38:18] that if he would pray for people that
[38:20] God would heal them and I believe that
[38:24] that he started quoting scripture to me
[38:26] and it's all Scripture that we know if
[38:28] we lay hands on the sick they shall
[38:30] recover and my name they will cast out
[38:32] devils that he's quoted all those
[38:33] scriptures and they're for us too and I
[38:36] want to be as much consecrated to the
[38:39] Lord and in tune with the Lord as my
[38:41] grandfather is because that's not just
[38:42] for him that's for all of us so this is
[38:44] the song is just to praise the Lord and
[38:47] you'll have to excuse me if I
[38:49] cry through it or anything but you guys
[38:51] sing with me if you would cuz it's um we
[38:53] all know it
[38:57] I
[38:58] am fine oh Lord I have heard thy voice
[39:06] and it told I love to me

[49:27] prayer amen thank God for the moving of
[49:31] the Spirit because without the Holy
[49:33] Ghost it's all in vain we thank God for
[49:36] that anointing of the Holy Ghost praise
[49:39] the Lord we need it not just in our
[49:41] singing and in the music we do but we
[49:45] need it yesterday going further the word
[49:47] but we need it in everyday living by the
[49:50] grace of Almighty God so I pray that
[49:52] grace in our lives that we've got an
[49:54] experience with God not just in our
[49:57] heads but we've got an experience with
[49:59] God in our hearts and we fellowship with
[50:02] God on the inside of the inside a man ie
[50:05] box with me and talks with me by the
[50:08] grace of God how many are conscious of
[50:11] God conscious of Jesus and in your home
[50:13] I mean they're conscious of Jesus and
[50:15] your jobs in your school a mad how many
[50:18] are conscious of Jesus when you're just
[50:20] with friends a man I tell you this if
[50:23] you're born again you never forget Jesus
[50:26] that's the truth and I have seen it you
[50:29] know the the false anointings and all of
[50:32] that and I remember one time I'll never
[50:34] forget it and
[50:36] in when I was attending the Pentecostal
[50:39] church and oh you know the people would
[50:42] praise God worship God those that didn't
[50:44] experience and
[50:46] intensify and when you when they
[50:49] testified you heard them when they says
[50:51] divided you know what they were saying
[50:53] but there was one brother there I
[50:55] noticed I said Lord I said II professing
[50:58] to be saved but where's the anointing
[51:01] in May because he was so quiet when it
[51:04] comes to singing he was so quiet when it
[51:06] comes to
[51:07] responding to the word he was so quiet
[51:09] in in just worship period when people
[51:13] worship he was English personally but he
[51:15] was it wasn't far away and it was just a
[51:18] mumbling and
[51:19] but this was the first and last time I
[51:23] went to hockey in in the stadium it's
[51:27] gone now but the building is there I
[51:31] think but it's used for something else
[51:33] and
[51:34] well this brother some brother would you
[51:37] go I'd like to go there I say okay I'll
[51:39] see I'll see what it's like and I never
[51:41] went after and but I noticed that this
[51:45] brother was about three seats or
[51:48] four-season if in front of me well
[51:52] I'll tell you this there was no problem
[51:54] to here oh
[51:56] he was really excited he was really into
[51:59] the end of the hockey game and he was
[52:02] screaming and shouting there was times
[52:03] he would stand up on his feet because he
[52:06] was so so excited and so glad that maybe
[52:09] is favorite team or his team was winning
[52:12] I said Lord I said he got the anointing
[52:15] here he got the spirit here where where
[52:17] is it in the church hey man and there's
[52:20] a lot of people like that they're very
[52:21] active when it comes to out there in the
[52:23] world but the not so active when it
[52:25] comes to the church and the presence of
[52:27] our Lord Jesus Christ well he ought to
[52:30] be more exciting a man and a greater
[52:32] blessing than what's going on in that
[52:34] world over there a man so the grace of
[52:37] God help us something is listening
[52:39] Saints ever an hour we should have it we
[52:41] should have it now a man but we're going
[52:44] to see it less and less and less because
[52:46] people are getting out of the Spirit the
[52:49] Holy Spirit and to get into the spirit
[52:51] more more the spirit of the world that's
[52:53] the truth and I guess a then I just that
[52:56] brother excited over that honky tonk a
[52:59] game but and not excited in church by
[53:02] there was many many others that are
[53:03] excited over anything that's going on in
[53:05] the world amen oh I pray grace it shows
[53:08] what shows are not born again but you're
[53:11] born again you're giving the pre
[53:13] evidence to Jesus amen brother it's
[53:16] serious again this is why their
[53:19] prophecies are going to be surprised who
[53:20] made it who didn't make it amen so the
[53:23] grace of God be with us as we go into
[53:26] the word and trying to conclude
[53:28] the message on the rapture we'll see
[53:33] what the Lord will do and but just to
[53:35] highlight some things that I have said
[53:37] before and I have made reference to it
[53:41] even just recently only to discover that
[53:44] the world is also being highlighted with
[53:47] these fact the prophet of God told us 50
[53:51] 60 years ago
[53:53] concerning the as I mentioned the
[53:56] brother that asked a prophet are there
[53:58] is there anyone else in the universe
[54:00] other than other than us on the earth
[54:02] and the Providence say back then almost
[54:05] 60 years ago he said well he said
[54:07] brother he said we we I think we'd be
[54:09] foolish to think were the only ones
[54:11] there are others are there as well he
[54:13] said well I think there was a science
[54:17] magazine in an in a grocery store of the
[54:19] week and
[54:20] and science was highlighting the fact
[54:23] that we are not the only ones in the
[54:26] universe as science is only now
[54:28] discovering it they thought it was only
[54:31] the earth they thought it was this
[54:32] universe whether it's discovering that
[54:35] there are others they believe with all
[54:36] their hearts they believe with all their
[54:38] knowledge that there are others in the
[54:41] universe amen and their eye lighting
[54:43] that so brother we know were in the end
[54:46] when all these things are coming out
[54:47] whether it came out for you and me the
[54:50] revelation by the Holy Ghost but now
[54:53] they're they're there with their
[54:55] knowledge that's getting into it and the
[54:57] prophet of God said they will get so
[54:58] close he said he said buddy God is going
[55:00] to stop it before they do he said that
[55:03] they could break into eternity
[55:05] and that's true the knowledge of science
[55:08] and all this technology and everything
[55:10] either getting close to breaking into
[55:12] eternity but he said before they do God
[55:15] is going to shut it down a man that is
[55:17] the truth so do brother I I've seen it
[55:20] you know and then when it comes to all
[55:22] these different magazines there and all
[55:25] my more and more it vindicates what God
[55:28] has done and it vindicates what God is
[55:31] doing because again it's not just a
[55:34] Christian that knows that the devil
[55:35] knows a man he does eat any and he knows
[55:38] he got his time is short so how many
[55:42] believers really feel that we have a
[55:44] short time you know and because of what
[55:47] God has done and what God is doing
[55:49] science would rise in judgment against a
[55:52] lot of believers and right because
[55:54] there's the effect on them a greater
[55:57] effect on them their knowledge then the
[55:59] Holy Ghost revelation has on many a
[56:01] believer and many a Christian so I pray
[56:04] the grace of God help us brother
[56:06] it's late so God see God requires
[56:10] something of you not just for you to say
[56:12] I believe this I believe that you know
[56:14] when it comes to walking in the spirit
[56:16] is more than saying I believe the devil
[56:18] does to a man you know I'm this and I'm
[56:22] that no no no you got to have more than
[56:24] that amen see what God is looking for is
[56:28] not just the knowledge of Jesus in you
[56:30] it's the it's the life of Jesus a man it
[56:34] is the token life of the blood of Jesus
[56:36] that has come back to you amen not just
[56:39] Lord I believe the later of the word as
[56:42] I already highlighted the quote with a
[56:44] promise of what we need is the dynamics
[56:47] amen it not not the road now the
[56:50] mechanics but the dynamics of the word
[56:53] brother to get into that we're going to
[56:55] have to dig deeper as the Prophet said
[56:59] right here just keep praying keep
[57:01] digging and he said don't stop and he
[57:05] said dig ditches out there and when you
[57:08] get down you hit an old tin can I'm to
[57:11] Todd's say I'm too tired throw it out of
[57:14] the way and keep digging just keep
[57:16] digging because we got to dig there many
[57:20] are digging into the world the things of
[57:22] the world the foolishness of the world
[57:23] that how many are digging into the
[57:25] revelation of God a man and I just
[57:28] taking the form of godliness and
[57:30] religion and being a churchgoer but your
[57:33] your yearning your perfect
[57:36] representation of a son and daughter of
[57:38] God amen and remember he said if you
[57:42] expect to miss the tribulation you
[57:44] better start digging amen and in the
[57:49] tribulation a brother it's the spirit of
[57:52] it is already on the earth a
[57:54] man knows that I I'm preaching to myself
[57:57] there he said I'm going to start digging
[57:59] deeper than I ever dug because I feel
[58:03] like the nation around the world that
[58:05] this ministry will again as it is known
[58:08] now about everywhere over the world and
[58:10] it and it has gone around the world a
[58:12] man so I pray God that by the grace of
[58:15] God that were closer to the rapture
[58:18] amen and the reality of it in our hearts
[58:21] and in our souls
[58:23] there with me in it again I don't know
[58:26] if you read it some of you do but when
[58:29] it comes to the devotionals by our
[58:31] brother Tim Dodd and the the devotional
[58:35] on March the 4th was very highlighting a
[58:38] man that God's requiring more of just
[58:41] church-going God's requiring more
[58:42] sometimes even of prayer and you know
[58:45] yes you can pray but there's many of
[58:48] their prayed but but again cause
[58:50] requiring the life he's requiring Christ
[58:53] made flesh in you and he said no matter
[58:56] and he said how much that you pray
[59:00] you'll never be forgiven until you
[59:03] believe you're forgiven you gotta
[59:05] exercise your faith a man then you
[59:08] confess that you are then live like you
[59:11] are forgiven
[59:13] amen and he said and and no one will
[59:17] still know no matter how much you cry
[59:20] how much you pray how much you shout how
[59:23] many times you speak with tongues or
[59:25] whatever you do you're still not until
[59:28] the fruits of the spirit bear record in
[59:30] you a mate because by their fruits you
[59:34] shall know them a man by the grace of
[59:38] God sews diantha and it goes beyond just
[59:41] going to church oh yes there's a life
[59:44] there's an attitude there's a spirit a
[59:46] man there's an anointing on you morning
[59:48] new tonight a man you just if you're
[59:51] born again you're a new creature a man
[59:54] you're born again its Christ in you if
[59:56] you're born again it's just the word and
[59:58] say it's God it's God's plan and it's
[1:00:01] god that's all you're cut off with amen
[1:00:03] and people may wonder say why there
[1:00:06] you're not interested in this not
[1:00:07] interested in and you know I'm I'm
[1:00:09] getting out of here a man you're if you
[1:00:12] want it you can stay he meant but I I'm
[1:00:14] leaving it all behind by the grace of
[1:00:16] Almighty God so god help us brother is
[1:00:19] my prayer
[1:00:21] father it may be because by the grace of
[1:00:24] God if we're looking for a rapture we've
[1:00:26] got to be living in expectation of it 24
[1:00:29] hours a day oh yeah as I said you know a
[1:00:33] Luther just talked just Legation morning
[1:00:36] to the night and and the others what God
[1:00:38] revealed to them they talked at morning
[1:00:40] new tonight Pentecost this morning noon
[1:00:42] and night and as I told you about the
[1:00:44] old fashioned Salvation Army that the
[1:00:47] officer missed somebody on down the road
[1:00:49] and just laid his hands on him and
[1:00:50] prayed for them a man not many would do
[1:00:52] that not this day and age no no no it
[1:00:56] would bear that reproach but I pray the
[1:00:58] grace of God help us to be spiritual
[1:01:00] amen the world would think oh you're a
[1:01:02] fanatic good we need to be a man we
[1:01:05] certainly need to be more fanatical than
[1:01:07] we are cut off in to the revelation that
[1:01:09] we are being a being the witness that
[1:01:11] God is required of us amen so that we
[1:01:15] are reflecting Jesus now morning noon
[1:01:17] and night oh there in the world among
[1:01:20] family among friends a mayor oh yes
[1:01:23] they'll recognize that is Jesus that is
[1:01:26] that you're a Christian you're different
[1:01:28] from the from the rest a man so the
[1:01:31] grace of God brother be with us to help
[1:01:32] us it's my prayer
[1:01:35] and
[1:01:38] just to I
[1:01:42] like
[1:01:44] that the Lord willing I was hoping to be
[1:01:47] able to get our brother Mark to minister
[1:01:49] on a and exhort us on maybe on a
[1:01:52] Wednesday Wednesday if he if he can do
[1:01:55] that event as the Lord leaves and then
[1:01:58] we're also going to get our brother Alec
[1:02:00] also because and brother Holly give me

[1:02:10] scripture a man and concerning the
[1:02:14] believers walk and it's not just the
[1:02:17] believers talk if the believers walk a
[1:02:20] man and the scriptures highlight the

[1:02:33] anointing and the spirit we got a walk
[1:02:34] in the spirit amen by the grace of God
[1:02:37] not the spirit of the world but you got
[1:02:40] to walk in the Holy Spirit amen and
[1:02:43] that's why there's so few that they got
[1:02:45] that anointing on them got that
[1:02:47] conversation and you know in them and

[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:13:16] a man praise the lord god bless you come
[1:13:20] with me to Matthew chapter
[1:13:22] 24 and
[1:13:25] we read just four verses in Matthew
[1:13:28] chapter 24 a
[1:13:32] man let's give attention to the Lord a
[1:13:35] man
[1:13:38] because he's the one we come to worship
[1:13:41] and we come to hear his word praise the
[1:13:45] name of the Lord we want Jesus to speak
[1:13:47] to us today
[1:13:48] amen maybe you'll touch on something
[1:13:52] that that you know about iNOS about no
[1:13:55] maybe nobody else knows about but he
[1:13:57] does so let's say or the Word of God it
[1:14:00] seemed we gotta be personal very
[1:14:02] personal it's God that worketh in me
[1:14:06] willing to do of his good pleasure I
[1:14:08] pray grace grace in
[1:14:11] Matthew chapter 24 and verse 1 and Jesus
[1:14:16] went out and departed from the temple
[1:14:19] and his disciples came to him for to
[1:14:22] show the disciples or came to him for to
[1:14:25] show him the buildings of the temple and
[1:14:28] jesus said unto them seeing not all
[1:14:31] these things verily I say unto you there
[1:14:34] shall not be left here one stone upon
[1:14:37] another that shall not be thrown down a
[1:14:41] man and
[1:14:43] as he said upon the Mount of Olives the
[1:14:46] disciples came unto him privately saying
[1:14:48] tell us when shall these things be and
[1:14:54] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[1:14:58] of the end of the world
[1:15:02] we're there and
[1:15:05] jesus answered and said unto them take
[1:15:09] heed that no man deceive you for many
[1:15:14] shall come in my name
[1:15:16] see how close it's going to be
[1:15:20] many shall come in my name
[1:15:23] saying I am Christ
[1:15:26] and shall deceive many
[1:15:29] god bless his words you may be seated
[1:15:33] let's go with me to verse 42
[1:15:38] of Matthew 24 and
[1:15:43] Saints another article choose a magazine
[1:15:46] that's in the inn it was in a grocery
[1:15:48] store and they got an article on the
[1:15:51] best and book in the world and it's the
[1:15:56] Bible it's just a regular Megas type
[1:15:59] magazine and there were no warning about
[1:16:02] the Bible why is it the best book in the
[1:16:04] world and a very mysterious how was it
[1:16:08] written you know why was it written
[1:16:10] where did they get all this information
[1:16:11] and these things and so they're there
[1:16:15] they take to almost the entire magazine
[1:16:17] and discuss the Bible a man and they I
[1:16:21] like this in the Bible and that in the
[1:16:22] Bible something else in the Bible well
[1:16:24] where where did man get these ideas
[1:16:27] that's what they're wondering about say

[1:18:19] earthquake hallelujah praise the name of

[1:18:38] Jerusalem a man but he said the New
[1:18:40] Jerusalem itself he says gonna come

[1:19:13] the name of the Lord and that's the one
[1:19:16] that the bride and the bridegroom is
[1:19:17] going to be in a man and it's gonna
[1:19:20] gonna Iranian by grace so I pray God
[1:19:23] Alva's and then no wonder there's dirt
[1:19:25] there a mace over this word there are
[1:19:27] maize over the things that are written
[1:19:29] there you know because they don't have
[1:19:30] revelation but to them it's a mystery
[1:19:33] but to us is the Rizla is revealed amen
[1:19:37] because we recognize God we recognize
[1:19:40] the plan of God the purpose of God and
[1:19:42] the pattern of God and that's what
[1:19:44] they're trying to figure out in that
[1:19:45] magazine why this why that and and they
[1:19:48] highlight this character and that
[1:19:50] character the I laid this profit of that
[1:19:52] profit a man then they come down to the
[1:19:54] who and the world they said is Matthew
[1:19:56] Mark Luke and John and and so on they
[1:19:59] said they said this they said this they
[1:20:01] said that and so on so that they're
[1:20:04] absolutely amazed but again what is it
[1:20:07] it is is that fulfilling the prophecy
[1:20:09] that the word is going to all the world
[1:20:12] it is fulfilling the prophecy that the
[1:20:15] whole world is going to bear witness
[1:20:17] going to hear about God and about his
[1:20:19] word a man now he said we King we're not
[1:20:22] going to get to everybody with this
[1:20:24] message but I tell you this God God God
[1:20:26] got the gun all in his plan that in
[1:20:30] there they're going to know about God
[1:20:32] they're gonna know about his word
[1:20:33] because he's gonna bear witness of the
[1:20:35] truth and he's gonna be a winner and of
[1:20:37] their witness of him amen so the world's
[1:20:40] gonna be without excuse brother because
[1:20:42] they're not because I testified to them
[1:20:44] or you testify to them but because that
[1:20:46] God testified to them God lated on this
[1:20:49] man's heart God laid on their hearts God
[1:20:52] laid on their arts and the ending winner
[1:20:53] that published this and they published
[1:20:55] that and they when they said this and
[1:20:57] they say there may be on on radio maybe
[1:20:59] on television maybe on the Internet see
[1:21:01] oh my hallelujah God uses that at all
[1:21:04] for his glory for the glory of God's for
[1:21:07] the there's not gonna be anybody without
[1:21:09] a witness of God without a testimony of
[1:21:11] God without a witness of the Word of God
[1:21:13] a man and again brother buddy when it
[1:21:17] comes to you and me with brother don't
[1:21:18] don't expect don't condemn them because
[1:21:20] they don't believe what you and I
[1:21:22] believe because what you and I believe
[1:21:24] was predestinated foreordained before
[1:21:26] the foundation of the world for the
[1:21:28] elect of God it is say many are called
[1:21:31] for the few that are chosen a man for
[1:21:34] the Bride of Christ down and down
[1:21:36] through the ages a man but again we just
[1:21:39] leave the others in the in Gaza and well
[1:21:42] yeah we're going we're going to be there
[1:21:43] and like in the judgment and then this
[1:21:46] one and that one is gonna be given away
[1:21:48] robe and the others are gonna be cast
[1:21:50] into the lake of fire and I just have
[1:21:53] their part in the lake of fire but they
[1:21:55] have their time in the lake of fire
[1:21:56] because that we know that is not going
[1:21:59] to be eternal because it is the second
[1:22:01] death a mayor it is the second death but
[1:22:05] a game by the grace of God God as God
[1:22:07] has given us the eternal life so the
[1:22:11] worth we're not gonna be affected by the
[1:22:12] second death and then there's come in a
[1:22:15] day in an hour when we when Christ and
[1:22:17] the bride are yeah it's gonna be given
[1:22:19] this one in this one in this one way
[1:22:21] robes a main because of their testimony
[1:22:24] and their faith in God remember again
[1:22:26] the Bible says that the book was open
[1:22:29] and hallelujah this this book a man it
[1:22:33] is the Word of God and the books and
[1:22:35] that is the book of books of their lives
[1:22:38] a man see the see the attitude of their
[1:22:42] lives to spirit of their lives the
[1:22:44] motives of the objections of their lives
[1:22:46] a man and we will say oh they belong to
[1:22:49] that church that church well God's
[1:22:51] looking beyond that into their hearts a
[1:22:53] million buying others looking beyond us
[1:22:56] into our hearts and our souls of fear we
[1:22:58] are bright not just such as men among
[1:23:02] the many that are called but by the
[1:23:04] grace of God we're not we're among the
[1:23:06] few that are chosen and we're among that
[1:23:08] we're among the very elect a main the
[1:23:12] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ oh my oh
[1:23:15] my brother for ages and for four years
[1:23:18] they that people believe that where God
[1:23:20] called that's it we're going to go to
[1:23:22] heaven rest going to hell no no that's
[1:23:24] in God's hands oh yeah I think I we
[1:23:27] leave that with the Lord God is
[1:23:29] righteous God is God is good alright
[1:23:32] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:23:33] a man then and like I told that that
[1:23:36] woman before that I said God is not
[1:23:38] going to send him to hell I said they
[1:23:40] choose to go to hell a man they they
[1:23:43] reject the word they reject this
[1:23:45] whatever God wants to show them and
[1:23:47] reveal to them they rejected and
[1:23:49] and they condemning themselves a man
[1:23:52] that is that is the truth brother but
[1:23:54] listen is not going to judge them by
[1:23:56] what God has revealed to us what is God
[1:23:59] revealed to them a man so because with
[1:24:02] us is to give us resurrection and
[1:24:05] rupturing faint Amy is to give us the
[1:24:08] faith to recognize the coming of the
[1:24:10] Lord is to give us the faith for the for
[1:24:13] the resurrection the rapture the new
[1:24:16] body and the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:24:18] and not all are not all are going to the
[1:24:21] marriage supper of the Lamb Amen ply
[1:24:24] trust whether we're going to recognize
[1:24:25] who we are see see God's requiring a lot
[1:24:29] more of us than he doing any will of
[1:24:31] them most definitely but I pray the
[1:24:34] grace of God elbows brother that we're
[1:24:37] going we're going to be sincere and true
[1:24:39] to what God has revealed to us you're
[1:24:41] going to answer for it oh yeah I know
[1:24:44] that the life that what God has revealed
[1:24:46] is that it is going to produce a
[1:24:48] resurrection and a rapture in faith and
[1:24:50] it's going to produce a life that got
[1:24:53] that resurrection are controlled by that
[1:24:55] resurrection and rapturing faith amen so
[1:24:58] my God have mercy on us Sara are we just
[1:25:01] kids controlled you know by this
[1:25:03] anointing that meant that caused us to
[1:25:05] go to church and and it caused us to do
[1:25:07] this and do that oh yeah yeah I'm a
[1:25:09] Christian so I won't do this and I won't
[1:25:10] do that I want to have this and I won't
[1:25:12] have that no God looking for more than
[1:25:14] that anyway God looking for the
[1:25:16] resurrection God looking for the rapture
[1:25:18] God looking for a people sons and
[1:25:21] daughters a man they got their faith and
[1:25:23] their living basically their lives are
[1:25:26] based on their faith resurrection a
[1:25:28] rapture amen by the grace of God the
[1:25:31] same you know as I said Luther's life
[1:25:33] was based on the justification by faith
[1:25:35] amen oh he was a different man he was a
[1:25:38] new creature in Christ amen and those
[1:25:40] that really believed that in the hearts
[1:25:42] were new creatures in Christ and there's
[1:25:44] many today there's a few today that I
[1:25:47] believe it in their hearts but most
[1:25:48] don't they God has gone on and on now
[1:25:52] it's coming down to the message of the
[1:25:53] hour a man there was there were many
[1:25:55] that believe what God had done what God
[1:25:57] was doing a man back in their day an
[1:26:01] hour but rather there there are a few
[1:26:03] that really believe it now as the truth
[1:26:06] brother and because there's a lot of
[1:26:08] people are getting into a doctrine and
[1:26:10] this doctrine and this doctrine and this
[1:26:12] revelation that revelation the devil
[1:26:14] perverting the message the devil is
[1:26:16] perverting the word and they what to get
[1:26:18] them off the street in narrow way that's
[1:26:22] leading to the resurrection and leading
[1:26:23] to the rapture the change of our bodies
[1:26:25] so easy is distracting them and the many
[1:26:28] are going this way many are going that
[1:26:30] way see it's like when the prophet of
[1:26:32] God went from Jeffersonville to Tucson
[1:26:35] and a lot of believers quit their jobs a
[1:26:37] lot of believers had sold their homes
[1:26:40] and what they do they moved to Tucson
[1:26:42] because they believed God was going to
[1:26:44] do this you know because arrival of God
[1:26:46] said don't do that don't do that a man
[1:26:49] see they said they were they were caught
[1:26:51] up with religion they were caught up
[1:26:52] with a religious spirit they were caught
[1:26:54] up with the Ministry of the other
[1:26:56] prophet and the signs and the wonders a
[1:26:58] man but they still never follow the
[1:27:01] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:27:03] because their eras believers are there
[1:27:05] in Tucson and in 1963 the angel comes
[1:27:08] down and say in the in the cloud of
[1:27:11] angels a man comes down and any men he
[1:27:15] noticed that seventh angel and
[1:27:18] it was attracted to him and what do they
[1:27:21] say they said go back to Jeffersonville
[1:27:23] for the old Mia Lord the old me of the
[1:27:26] seven seals a man so brother or what is
[1:27:29] one of those believers do did they stay
[1:27:31] in Tucson some day did they sell the
[1:27:34] house that moved back to Jefferson Villa
[1:27:35] Gant see they should follow the
[1:27:37] leadership of the Holy Ghost and there's
[1:27:40] many a so-called believer today that's
[1:27:42] not following the leadership of the
[1:27:44] oligos in their lives no they they they
[1:27:47] got an intellectual belief in the
[1:27:49] message a male I believe the message I
[1:27:52] believe God did this I believe God did
[1:27:54] that but brother what's he what's he
[1:27:56] doing in you what what does he want to
[1:27:59] accomplish in you what's he expecting in
[1:28:01] you a man not just come to the what we
[1:28:04] call a message church no no but it's
[1:28:08] coming to the message more amore to the
[1:28:10] word more and more into the revelation
[1:28:12] of Christ and we get more and more into
[1:28:15] the revelation of Christ listen Saints
[1:28:17] hallelujah the revelation of Christ in
[1:28:19] him is the revelations the faith with
[1:28:22] the resurrection it is the faith for the
[1:28:24] rapture amen he said I got power to lay
[1:28:27] my life down and I've got power to pick
[1:28:29] it up again now he's got that power that
[1:28:31] anointing in his bride and she got power
[1:28:34] to lay down her life and pick it up
[1:28:35] again a man is Christ in her the hope of
[1:28:38] glory amen her brother is not following
[1:28:42] our our feelings religious feelings and
[1:28:45] so on is following the Holy Ghost
[1:28:47] leadership amen what does God want me to
[1:28:50] do what does God want me to say and how
[1:28:53] does God want me to live and so on where
[1:28:55] does God want me to live a million then
[1:28:58] again like I said there are people who
[1:29:00] have left his church over the years and
[1:29:02] they moved to this church moving to that
[1:29:03] church why bigger churches because why
[1:29:06] because they wanted to hide among the
[1:29:08] trees of the garden
[1:29:09] amen as it was in the first Garden of
[1:29:13] Eden so saying the last Garden of Eden
[1:29:16] and then there hiding among the trees of
[1:29:18] the garden amen but not the brain not by
[1:29:22] any means brother sister so I pray grace
[1:29:24] in the name of Jesus Alba's that we're
[1:29:26] going to stay with the word amen and
[1:29:29] that God is going to find resurrection
[1:29:31] and RAM stirring faith in us and he's
[1:29:33] going to find that we're caught up with
[1:29:34] it and and we just we just can't get it
[1:29:36] out of our minds he may have any time
[1:29:39] sometimes that all I'll stand up and
[1:29:41] I'll say Lord the resurrection the
[1:29:44] rapture I said I'm looking for it I'm
[1:29:46] out waiting for it I'm thirsting for
[1:29:47] Lord I want it I want to get out of here
[1:29:50] Lord
[1:29:52] I'll think about this brother and think
[1:29:54] about that sister I said Lord they're
[1:29:56] right there they're gone on but as
[1:29:58] they're right there and so on as old my
[1:30:01] lord I celibate still live for the
[1:30:03] resurrection live for the rapture pray
[1:30:05] for the resurrection pray mother answer
[1:30:08] hunger and thirst shorten and many of us
[1:30:11] got that hunger and thirst I Luther head
[1:30:13] for justification and then I got that
[1:30:15] hunger thirst that Wesley had for
[1:30:17] sanctification and how many got the
[1:30:19] hunger and thirst of the Pentecostals
[1:30:21] and for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:23] and the gifts of the Spirit a made
[1:30:25] morning noon and night hungry hungry
[1:30:28] thirsty thirsty a man there was the
[1:30:30] power of God there was the anointing of
[1:30:32] the Holy Ghost moving on the earth a man
[1:30:35] to bring everything to a climax fling
[1:30:38] bring it everything do it in anybody
[1:30:40] others are just caught up in religion
[1:30:42] and God is going to do this God is going
[1:30:45] to do that yeah but he's gonna do it eat
[1:30:46] you he's gonna do it in me amen God
[1:30:50] always did he did it in Logar he did it
[1:30:52] in the lutheran he did it in the
[1:30:54] reference he did it in the old-fashioned
[1:30:56] Salvation Army and other churches and he
[1:30:58] did it better consoles now he's doing
[1:31:01] something in you and me by grace ain't
[1:31:03] 9:00 and alternative show we got the
[1:31:05] Holy Ghost we're not going to be able to
[1:31:07] get it out of our mind the devil won't
[1:31:09] be able to get it out of our minds
[1:31:11] that ever won't be able to get it away
[1:31:13] from from from the elect of God but I
[1:31:16] tell you this the devil he is deceiving
[1:31:18] a lot of believers and again that's what
[1:31:21] he said
[1:31:22] Jesus said there in a in Matthew he said
[1:31:25] take heed that no man deceive you for
[1:31:28] many shall come in my name saying I am
[1:31:30] Christ and shall deceive many a man
[1:31:35] they're going to deceive many and he
[1:31:37] said they'll show great signs and
[1:31:38] wonders insomuch that ever were possible
[1:31:41] they should deceive the very elect a
[1:31:43] mayor and they've had articles of
[1:31:46] magazine there and there is their day
[1:31:48] and one is still there now and
[1:31:51] they bring in about all robbers they
[1:31:53] bring it about this brother this brother
[1:31:55] that brother and the last magazine that
[1:31:57] I saw there this week was one it was a
[1:32:00] Billy Graham hey man the pastor the
[1:32:04] pastor of the United States so they're
[1:32:07] bringing in about him and his ministry
[1:32:09] and well anyway what was the
[1:32:11] significance of his ministry a man but
[1:32:13] as it was in the days of Noah yes but as
[1:32:17] it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:32:19] because that was two messengers to Sodom
[1:32:22] and Gomorrah was Billy Graham and all
[1:32:24] Roberts a man to Messer's went down the
[1:32:28] law two messengers have been out there
[1:32:30] in my my my lord how they're in Sodom
[1:32:33] and Gomorrah brother and the messages
[1:32:35] are gone anybody the messages are gone
[1:32:38] but where's locked but brother I tell
[1:32:42] you this where is Abraham and Sarah
[1:32:45] they were the presence of God they were
[1:32:48] Abraham at the hallelujah Abraham had
[1:32:51] the revelation that that really they
[1:32:52] didn't have in Sodom and Gomorrah that
[1:32:54] lot really never had ever had a
[1:32:56] revelation of one of those angels it was
[1:32:58] he was the he was God and Abraham by
[1:33:02] before they called him Lord a man
[1:33:05] without a guy got a girl and the
[1:33:07] sacrifices a man he had the revelation
[1:33:10] of God here the revelation out of the
[1:33:12] son of man that had come down to
[1:33:15] minister to Abraham and remind him of
[1:33:17] the promise of God amen no he didn't
[1:33:19] remind them of the promise but to bring
[1:33:21] it to pass any man he was reminding
[1:33:25] Abraham of the judgment of struggling

[1:33:29] the promise that God had given him years
[1:33:31] before hallelujah amen they wait a year
[1:33:34] after year after year until I got to the
[1:33:37] place where it seemed impossible

[1:36:47] brother sister with all of our hearts
[1:36:49] amen and in verse 42 again so there's so
[1:36:54] much scripture he said watch therefore
[1:36:57] for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
[1:37:00] come
[1:37:01] you know not but you'll write if your
[1:37:04] elect you gonna recognize it and he said
[1:37:07] know this that if the Goodman of the
[1:37:10] house had known what watch the thief
[1:37:12] would come he would have watched and
[1:37:15] would not have suffered his house to be
[1:37:17] broken up and he a and here's Christ I
[1:37:20] lighting about a thief and again you'll
[1:37:22] find it that's the lorry as he comes as
[1:37:24] a thief in the night amen but he said
[1:37:27] you're not children of the night you're
[1:37:28] children of the day and you're gonna
[1:37:30] recognize the way it's in the eyes of
[1:37:33] the world he's a thief he's coming in
[1:37:35] this hour he's coming in that hour but
[1:37:37] the bride's gonna recognize him and go
[1:37:38] with him any man he's going to take them
[1:37:41] right she's the missing ones by the
[1:37:45] grace of God and he said therefore be
[1:37:49] also ready for in such an hour as ye
[1:37:53] think not the Son of man cometh Oh
[1:37:57] a lot of people looking for Jesus
[1:38:01] they're looking for the man called Jesus
[1:38:03] but no it's the son of me it's the
[1:38:06] revelation of the word made flesh
[1:38:10] praise the Lord revealed himself through
[1:38:12] flesh again that's whether probably God
[1:38:14] said I said I am NOT I said I am a son
[1:38:18] of man and I say said revealing the son
[1:38:21] of man hey
[1:38:24] he has Karen but how many of us are
[1:38:27] conscious of his presence
[1:38:29] that's right so that it brings
[1:38:31] conviction in our hearts our souls our
[1:38:33] minds our spirits a man and no matter
[1:38:36] what we're doing oh lord help me and be
[1:38:38] with me Lord help me keep looking up
[1:38:40] Jesus a man for the resident looking up
[1:38:43] for the change science is looking up
[1:38:46] where's the bride looking up
[1:38:49] science is looking up and recognizing
[1:38:52] that there are others in in the universe
[1:38:53] out there
[1:38:54] are we looking up oh praise the Lord and
[1:38:59] recognizing that there are others right
[1:39:01] there
[1:39:03] science is recognizing them are we
[1:39:06] recognizing these that have gone on
[1:39:09] before us
[1:39:10] any man brother there's a see sciences
[1:39:15] breaking into eternity brother how much
[1:39:17] the bride ought to break into eternity
[1:39:20] science has seen that what aren't you
[1:39:23] and I to see we got to get out of the
[1:39:25] human spirit get into the Holy Spirit
[1:39:28] hallelujah so the Holy Ghost has got
[1:39:31] control by the grace of God so it's not
[1:39:34] me that lives as the resident prayers
[1:39:36] Christ that liveth in us and so on and
[1:39:39] ever and again verse 44
[1:39:43] therefore be ye also ready for in such
[1:39:46] an hour as ye think not the Son of man
[1:39:48] cometh and he comes and he's revealed as
[1:39:51] the son of man other than looking for
[1:39:53] Jesus to come they're looking for the
[1:39:55] look see what they're looking for
[1:39:57] they're looking for the picture of Jesus
[1:40:00] yeah that's what they're looking for but
[1:40:03] the bride he's looking for the
[1:40:04] revelation of the son of man
[1:40:07] because he came back and he's revealed
[1:40:10] as the Son of Man down to the church
[1:40:12] ages the revelation of the word of God a
[1:40:14] man to be made flesh and now he's
[1:40:17] revealed in the last hours as son of man
[1:40:20] but he comes Alleluia hallelujah this
[1:40:23] coming is as a thief

[1:41:12] the Godhead bodily in flesh and brother
[1:41:16] he was sober a man he was on his guard
[1:41:19] he was he was watching this he was
[1:41:22] watching that amen that a southern
[1:41:24] wonder why Jesus did this why Jesus did
[1:41:26] that any man he was mean sober and he

[1:41:30] what spirits he was dealing with and
[1:41:32] brother we had the sober and we had to

[1:41:41] Jesus said I've chose twelve of you and
[1:41:42] one of yous a demo and brother there and

[1:41:51] deceiving the people there any man
[1:41:53] delayed to get the people off track you
[1:41:56] know they believe that is to believe
[1:41:58] that all my brothers sister as I've
[1:42:00] drawn on the board a number of times
[1:42:01] that God is gods goes right down
[1:42:03] straight down from time to eternity a
[1:42:06] man down trip with his word amen but the
[1:42:08] enemy will cause the people to divert it
[1:42:10] and go off and go off here and go off
[1:42:12] there any man well he's great he's
[1:42:15] grafting in here grafting this limb
[1:42:18] you've grafted that name ago off and
[1:42:19] he'll walk he meant yet but once it's
[1:42:22] the life cord off into that limit the
[1:42:24] life of the original tree going off into
[1:42:26] that limb and that's deceiving many but
[1:42:29] the bride goes on until she brings forth
[1:42:32] the fruit oh yeah it's like the main one
[1:42:35] time yeah it was real and then one time
[1:42:37] went into a certain guard and did this
[1:42:40] other man there he had he had a tree and
[1:42:43] we looked at the tree
[1:42:45] he saw all different kinds of fruit on
[1:42:48] the tree and he said what what is this

[1:42:56] always said you want to know what kind
[1:42:57] of a tree is he look at the top and he
[1:43:00] said the fruit that went forth on the
[1:43:01] tongue amen he said these other things
[1:43:05] that you're seen he said was grafted in
[1:43:08] anyway grafted in but it was bringing
[1:43:11] forth different fruit but a man it was
[1:43:16] drawing on the life
[1:43:22] drinking the light it was
[1:43:25] satisfying their hunger for the you know
[1:43:27] with the life coming out of the original
[1:43:29] seed that was praying oh thank God for
[1:43:33] the revelation brother thank God for
[1:43:35] these I understand this understanding so
[1:43:38] that we're not deceived a man that we're
[1:43:41] not good if it is saved by religion no
[1:43:45] no we're gonna stay with the revelation
[1:43:47] of the word by the grace of Almighty God
[1:43:50] just think of that I prefer I pray God
[1:43:52] that we're not grafted in no no we're an
[1:43:55] original branch
[1:43:57] amen because that tree is gonna put for
[1:43:59] the original branches and the devil is
[1:44:01] going to graft in branches amen the try
[1:44:04] to distract the elect on off on that one
[1:44:07] just track the Elector this one note the
[1:44:09] electrical to stay in the middle of the
[1:44:10] road anywhere and bring forth the fruit

[1:44:38] the fruit
[1:44:43] brings it out in Matthew 13 there it's
[1:44:47] absolutely amazing because then it
[1:44:48] represents seven church ages in all the
[1:44:51] parables that Jesus was giving any man
[1:44:53] and any speaks of all the seven
[1:44:57] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and
[1:45:00] the soul and so on from the first age
[1:45:03] right our down
[1:45:04] to the last page and brother I got it
[1:45:08] marked here the first second third form
[1:45:09] around down to the last and what's
[1:45:11] happening in the last parable
[1:45:14] it's the catching its throwing out the
[1:45:17] net bringing it all in but that's not it
[1:45:20] it doesn't stop there cool good a duster
[1:45:23] I seen that oh my understand what's
[1:45:27] going on now

[1:45:32] part of that panel brother it's the
[1:45:35] separation
[1:45:37] yeah oh they bring that they throw the
[1:45:39] net and they bring them all in oh
[1:45:41] they're all see they're all but message
[1:45:43] believers oh no no it's a separation
[1:45:46] they're going to take out the real fish
[1:45:49] and lay that aside and they're gonna
[1:45:51] look at that
[1:45:53] throw it back into the ocean
[1:45:55] yeah separation that's why God's do a
[1:45:59] brother separating the bride onto
[1:46:00] himself a man and just say that Matt
[1:46:04] Matthew 13 7 Church ages Matthew 24 is
[1:46:08] is the seven seals a
[1:46:11] man Olivia seven seals yes
[1:46:15] again I got it I lighted here there from
[1:46:18] the first right on down to the fourth
[1:46:19] the fifth to sixth and on to the seventh
[1:46:21] seal in Matthew 24 amen the Prophet I
[1:46:25] lighted the fact is this all Jesus
[1:46:26] revealing his mystery down through seven
[1:46:28] seals
[1:46:29] in Matthew 24 hallelujah praise the name
[1:46:33] of the Lord brother God Alba's that will
[1:46:35] not be deceived a man the grace of God
[1:46:39] turn with me to Luke chapter 17 I
[1:46:43] understand one of the Brethren that
[1:46:45] mentioned it after I finished
[1:46:46] ministering one time recently
[1:46:49] not only eight locating concerning evil
[1:46:53] events and speedily nevertheless when
[1:46:55] the Son of Man comes will he find faith
[1:46:56] or belief in the whole body of revealed
[1:46:59] truth no he's not gonna find very much
[1:47:02] that I paid
[1:47:04] no do we believe in the whole body of
[1:47:07] revealed truth
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:12] sweet Luke chapter 17
[1:47:17] and verse wedding and when he was
[1:47:22] demanded of the Pharisees
[1:47:24] when the kingdom of God should come he
[1:47:29] answered them and said the kingdom of
[1:47:31] God cometh not with observations it's a
[1:47:35] revelation
[1:47:37] to many are looking they want to see it
[1:47:40] with the natural eyes whether what's
[1:47:43] important is what you see what your
[1:47:44] spiritual eyes not we just see in your
[1:47:47] head what do you see in your heart a
[1:47:49] man see some would look at Jesus and
[1:47:53] first coming and they saw this all this
[1:47:55] all that others looked at him and just
[1:47:57] saw him
[1:48:00] surely he's not he's not the Messiah
[1:48:03] you know oh yeah you they'd say they say
[1:48:06] was born this way he was born that way
[1:48:08] they say this they say that but they
[1:48:10] never believed it because they had their
[1:48:12] own ideas about the birth of the Messiah
[1:48:15] how when we're so on they thought it was
[1:48:18] this God Elvis brother we're not going
[1:48:20] to take our ideas regarding the
[1:48:21] resurrection rapture and the road we're
[1:48:25] going to take the revelation of the word
[1:48:26] but I'll tell you what is what is the
[1:48:30] beginning of the of the resurrection
[1:48:31] rapture what is it yeah the the climax
[1:48:35] it's the revelation of the son of man
[1:48:38] any man as Jesus again told concerning
[1:48:43] the the Son of Man in Matthew 24 any man
[1:48:46] now in Luke 18 17 he's again referring
[1:48:50] to the revelation salamander and the
[1:48:53] kingdom of God the kingdom of God come
[1:48:55] in not with observation with you with
[1:48:58] your natural eyes it is by faith god
[1:49:01] help us
[1:49:04] amen and neither shall they say lo here
[1:49:08] or lo there for behold the kingdom of
[1:49:12] God is within you
[1:49:15] Amen the kingdom of God is within you
[1:49:19] god of us to recognize it it's Christ in
[1:49:22] you the hope of glory and it's the hope
[1:49:25] with expectation of fulfillment
[1:49:28] amen so should the kingdom of God is
[1:49:32] within you and he said unto the
[1:49:35] disciples
[1:49:36] see the kingdom of God doesn't have an
[1:49:39] outward show its inward revelation but
[1:49:42] too many are looking for the outward
[1:49:45] God out brother it'll come and all these
[1:49:49] things we made flesh but first it starts
[1:49:52] in your soul a man and as a thief in the
[1:49:56] night is taking us on out
[1:49:58] and we become flesh
[1:50:01] in a glorified body that the world is
[1:50:04] not going to recognize the world's not
[1:50:06] going to see but we're gonna see one
[1:50:08] another
[1:50:09] every man
[1:50:11] brother listen if science is breaking
[1:50:13] into that other dimension and they're
[1:50:16] seeing this and seeing that now what
[1:50:19] about you and I to see
[1:50:21] by faith god help us and
[1:50:25] in verse 22 he said either said on to
[1:50:28] his disciples the days will come when ye
[1:50:31] shall desire to see one of the days of
[1:50:33] the Son of Man and ye shall not see it
[1:50:37] and they shall say unto you see here see
[1:50:41] there go not after them nor follow them
[1:50:44] for as the Lightning that lighteth out
[1:50:47] of the one part of under heaven and
[1:50:49] shine it out of the other part under
[1:50:51] heaven so shall also the Son of Man be
[1:50:57] hallelujah and brother is a testimony to
[1:51:00] the world but they didn't recognize it
[1:51:03] as I said I got Life magazine and
[1:51:06] they're testifying of this and they and
[1:51:09] they're explaining the mystery of it
[1:51:11] they said it's they thought first it was
[1:51:14] a plane
[1:51:15] they said it was just a jet or something
[1:51:18] that was flying over but they discovered
[1:51:20] number one there was no jet flew over
[1:51:23] and number two they said even if it was
[1:51:27] he said that cloud he said is too high
[1:51:30] he said for it to leave any any any
[1:51:34] thing that you could see it was - I
[1:51:38] they they were giving the the the height
[1:51:42] of it from the earth and they said - - I
[1:51:44] for that for anything to exist in that
[1:51:46] in data in that area
[1:51:48] yes Life magazine is explaining it the
[1:51:52] mystery of it and to them and that was
[1:51:54] in June 1963 and four five months after
[1:51:58] that after it happened and the end but
[1:52:01] to them it was still a mystery
[1:52:03] even in June amen and the prophet of God
[1:52:07] did to show the people the magazine or
[1:52:09] highlight the fact that it was on on a
[1:52:12] bulletin board outside the picture of it
[1:52:14] that man had taken yeah and he talked
[1:52:16] and he mentioned the magazine like
[1:52:18] magazine and what they were saying and
[1:52:19] like I told you before that on the other
[1:52:22] side of that page is a rainbow
[1:52:26] not only that not just a rainbow
[1:52:31] period is a rainbow at midnight
[1:52:36] see they had the mystery of the cloud on
[1:52:39] one side and on the other side it was

[1:56:23] their church
[1:56:24] you better be led by the spirit
[1:56:28] that's right and again this let me maybe
[1:56:32] the Lord allowed me this to happen so I
[1:56:34] could explain that when I was doing
[1:56:37] something down in the basement where I
[1:56:39] live and in the cage there and I had
[1:56:42] some things that I wanted to put in my
[1:56:43] van but I just laid it on somebody I
[1:56:45] laid it on a person's vehicle
[1:56:47] that was parked in front of my cage and
[1:56:51] it was a
[1:56:53] calendar I received from brother our
[1:56:56] home and it was a religious calendar
[1:56:58] spiritual calendar and there was a
[1:57:01] couple other things too but when I when
[1:57:04] I finished there I forgot it they left
[1:57:07] it there and they they found it when
[1:57:11] they got into the vehicle to go
[1:57:13] somewhere his wife noticed that she
[1:57:15] reached out took it in and when they
[1:57:18] noticed the calendar was religious oh
[1:57:19] the man said oh
[1:57:22] he did that to to to convert us
[1:57:27] if he's just trying to convert us
[1:57:30] because they knew they know I'm a pastor
[1:57:33] and they were and they respect my
[1:57:36] ministry and sister Betty because
[1:57:38] because we're into the ministry and so
[1:57:40] on and I
[1:57:42] didn't know they were thinking that but
[1:57:44] his wife told me after and I and when I
[1:57:47] went to see him again to get the to get
[1:57:50] the calendar back and they get the other
[1:57:52] things back and I always said I thought
[1:57:54] you just did that to convert us I said
[1:57:56] no I said we don't do that I said we
[1:57:59] leave that between the individual and
[1:58:00] God
[1:58:02] all we said so he said if we if we
[1:58:05] showed up in your church I guess you'd
[1:58:07] fall out of the pulpit
[1:58:08] yeah I said maybe really oh
[1:58:12] yeah
[1:58:14] and I've seen somebody else too was
[1:58:16] confessing driving by our church here
[1:58:18] and going to another Church and
[1:58:20] and they looked at the church here one
[1:58:23] time and then looked into the parking
[1:58:24] lot they said oh my Jerell got a lot of
[1:58:27] people in there today because they saw
[1:58:29] so many vehicles parked in front
[1:58:31] Amen they see it they recognized the
[1:58:35] church but they don't recognize the word
[1:58:39] anybody I trust we're here because we
[1:58:42] recognize the word of God and what God
[1:58:43] has done and what God is doing
[1:58:46] amen and that you won't you believe that
[1:58:49] you're part of what God is doing that
[1:58:51] you're part of the resurrection you're
[1:58:53] part of the rapture you have been
[1:58:54] predestinated and elected to be
[1:58:57] resurrected raptured a man God is
[1:59:00] putting us in contact more and more less
[1:59:03] and less with this this dimension more
[1:59:05] and more with the other dimension
[1:59:08] Jesus was he was in contact with that
[1:59:12] dimension yeah
[1:59:14] as I said look what he look what
[1:59:16] happened when he went up but up on them
[1:59:17] out and Moseley Elijah came to him
[1:59:21] he was more conscious of them that he
[1:59:24] was of the disciples a
[1:59:26] man knowing that he talked about the
[1:59:29] word the three of the Moses the Elijah
[1:59:31] and Jesus was talking about the word for
[1:59:33] that day the word for that hour what was
[1:59:36] going to happen what was going to come
[1:59:37] to pass
[1:59:39] amen
[1:59:40] they were looking down to Jerusalem and
[1:59:43] talking about what what Jesus was what
[1:59:46] God's going to happen to Jesus their
[1:59:48] brother is he is God talking to you and
[1:59:51] revealing to you and me what's going to
[1:59:53] happen to us
[1:59:55] you don't want to think about it
[1:59:58] well Jesus thought about it amen he
[2:00:02] thought about it for the extent that he
[2:00:03] controlled his life what he did when he
[2:00:06] did it where he did it he just followed
[2:00:08] the leadership with the whole ego
[2:00:09] anybody until I had mentioned before it
[2:00:12] got to the place where they he wouldn't
[2:00:15] he wouldn't talk to anybody
[2:00:17] just he went to and they talked to that
[2:00:20] woman at the well and he talked to this
[2:00:23] one that one that the others wouldn't
[2:00:25] talk to
[2:00:27] no no the disciples wouldn't talk to
[2:00:29] that one others wouldn't talk to this
[2:00:32] one of that one would Jesus did cuz they
[2:00:34] were they were the seed of God you talk
[2:00:36] about God hidden and revealed is a
[2:00:39] visiting
[2:00:41] but this is Saints where sinners saved
[2:00:45] by grace
[2:00:47] hey man we are sinners saved by the
[2:00:51] grace of the revealed word
[2:00:52] we're saying saved by the grace of the
[2:00:55] revelation of the Son of Man
[2:00:58] amen because it was as a sort of man
[2:01:01] that he came the god prophet to redeem
[2:01:04] us
[2:01:06] Alleluia
[2:01:08] so he said as it was in the days of Noah
[2:01:11] he says there number one he said first
[2:01:14] the Son of man must love suffer many
[2:01:17] things not few things he must suffer
[2:01:20] many things and
[2:01:21] be rejected of this generation and as it
[2:01:26] was in the days of Noah so shall it also
[2:01:28] be in the days of the son of man see son
[2:01:32] of man son of man son of man
[2:01:34] but the world in general for the son of
[2:01:36] God
[2:01:38] but the son of man is the revelation of
[2:01:41] the word in flesh
[2:01:44] hallelujah
[2:01:47] because he's going to take a bride out
[2:01:49] of the flesh
[2:01:51] so he's going to be revealed to her in
[2:01:53] flesh he's going to identify with her
[2:01:55] amen he's gonna give her a resurrection
[2:01:58] a rapture in faith thank God hallelujah
[2:02:00] God Elvis true believers is the our
[2:02:02] serious God I literally where we're at
[2:02:05] that time with the change
[2:02:09] many times I've said Oh Lord I trust we
[2:02:11] haven't missed it
[2:02:16] you better be on your guard
[2:02:19] so he said even the sotius so shall it
[2:02:23] be in the days of the Son of Man
[2:02:25] they did eat they drank they married
[2:02:28] wives they were given in marriage until
[2:02:30] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[2:02:33] and the flood came and destroyed them
[2:02:35] all yeah but what about that does it
[2:02:37] mean it means that there was no
[2:02:39] separation there was total mixture
[2:02:42] marrying giving him marriage doing this
[2:02:45] doing this there there was no separation
[2:02:47] on the Lord
[2:02:50] it was just Noah and his family but the
[2:02:53] rest were all mixed up
[2:02:56] that's right god help us brother God
[2:03:00] calls to God comforts to separation but
[2:03:03] no
[2:03:04] they just went and got mixed up
[2:03:07] the the seed of Cain the seed of Abel
[2:03:11] and everything got all mixed up
[2:03:14] that's what it means as it was in the
[2:03:17] days of Noah as it was in the days of
[2:03:20] Sodom and Gomorrah listen he said
[2:03:23] likewise also as it was in the days of
[2:03:26] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[2:03:29] they sold Oh
[2:03:32] going from natural relationships to
[2:03:38] natural living and the things of the
[2:03:41] world he that loves the world and the
[2:03:43] things of the world the love of God is
[2:03:46] not in him and
[2:03:47] the oldest focus today that Sanda were
[2:03:50] on the world and on the things of the
[2:03:52] world the eat drink bought sold they
[2:03:57] planted and they build it well that's
[2:04:00] the world we live
[2:04:04] how many it's gonna be we'll be
[2:04:07] satisfied with Jesus testimony
[2:04:09] and like he said to the disciples why
[2:04:12] you following me for when I got nowhere
[2:04:13] to lay my head
[2:04:16] what about John the Baptist and how he
[2:04:20] was clothed
[2:04:21] and the food that he
[2:04:26] not many
[2:04:29] that's why there's many are called few
[2:04:32] are chosen
[2:04:33] pres the bride we're talking about bride
[2:04:36] now not just Christians bride
[2:04:42] totally separate under the Lord totally
[2:04:44] as in the natural that the bride subject
[2:04:47] to the husband
[2:04:49] now
[2:04:51] that the pilot of Gaza were living in a
[2:04:53] woman's world and
[2:04:55] the women never had control in the in
[2:04:58] the world like she has control today
[2:05:02] politicians one time to it never a woman
[2:05:06] that was a politician
[2:05:07] one man one would never did this never
[2:05:09] did that no she's just she's just a
[2:05:11] woman she was a mother she was a wife
[2:05:12] and so on not today
[2:05:17] absolutely amazing
[2:05:20] grace of God
[2:05:24] as it was in the days of lot they did
[2:05:27] eat they drank they bought they sold and
[2:05:29] they planted and they builded
[2:05:32] but the same day that lot went out of
[2:05:35] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[2:05:38] heaven and destroyed
[2:05:39] them all brother not far away
[2:05:44] even thus shall it be in the day when
[2:05:49] the Son of Man is revealed
[2:05:53] her brother the fire from heaven has
[2:05:56] fallen and it's destroying the world
[2:06:00] god help us
[2:06:02] by grace to recognize the revelation of
[2:06:05] the Son of Man and through the
[2:06:07] revelation is giving us the faith that
[2:06:09] peace is God
[2:06:12] faith that's taking us out of time and
[2:06:15] putting us into eternity
[2:06:17] really sincerely honestly you think
[2:06:20] different you act different you're just
[2:06:23] and there's no way that people of the
[2:06:25] world it's very few will respect you and
[2:06:27] and and tell us it with you associate
[2:06:29] with you but most they just can't
[2:06:31] identify with you
[2:06:32] and as we go on there be fewer and fewer
[2:06:37] to be able to identify with us
[2:06:39] yeah
[2:06:43] what God has done is to give us an
[2:06:46] endtime faith Bri the son of man the
[2:06:49] revelation of the Son of man to give us
[2:06:51] resurrection and a rapturing faith
[2:06:54] not a personal faith or belief in God
[2:06:57] but belief in the whole body of revealed
[2:07:00] truth
[2:07:01] the climax of their climax of that
[2:07:04] revelation for the elect is the
[2:07:07] resurrection and the rapture
[2:07:09] not many professing Christians or
[2:07:12] Messi's believers are being caught up in
[2:07:15] the faith not many
[2:07:19] not many are being caught up in the
[2:07:21] revelation of the resurrection and the
[2:07:24] rapture they're focusing more and more
[2:07:27] on this whole world
[2:07:29] they're there enjoy I tell be honest I'm
[2:07:32] surprised that the number of believers
[2:07:33] that are enjoying this world
[2:07:36] I'm surprised that the non-believers
[2:07:39] that are that are focusing on the things
[2:07:42] that you know make them happily happy
[2:07:45] naturally
[2:07:47] public spiritual
[2:07:49] well voting in the heart what about in
[2:07:52] the soul is there any hunger for any
[2:07:54] thirst people today are hungry and
[2:07:57] thirsty for more for the natural things
[2:07:59] in the air spiritual
[2:08:00] that's the truth
[2:08:03] that's the absolute truth
[2:08:06] not many are being caught up in the
[2:08:09] faith
[2:08:15] I
[2:08:15] thought comment believed us
[2:08:21] again a confirmation of the end
[2:08:24] confirmation faith the effects of faith
[2:08:28] so that you're caught up with with the
[2:08:30] spiritual with God
[2:08:32] not with the natural
[2:08:37] no no no you leave the natural in the
[2:08:39] hands of God you follow his leadership
[2:08:42] not my will father time be done
[2:08:46] yeah so there's not many professing
[2:08:49] Christians or message believers are
[2:08:52] being cut up in the faith the revelation
[2:08:54] of the resurrection of the rapture
[2:08:57] day and night Martin Luther was
[2:09:00] rejoicing in the faith the revealed
[2:09:03] truth
[2:09:04] day and night John Wesley was rejoicing
[2:09:07] in the faith the revelation of being
[2:09:10] sanctified in our Lord Jesus Christ he
[2:09:13] lived for it he died for it and knowing
[2:09:16] that at one point in John Wesley's life
[2:09:19] the government of England came to his
[2:09:21] house
[2:09:26] because they had some idea about the
[2:09:29] money that he was taking in that was
[2:09:31] being given him
[2:09:33] and by the way when John Wesley died and
[2:09:35] they went and searched his house and
[2:09:37] searched him you know they only found a
[2:09:39] few pennies or something in his pocket
[2:09:43] they couldn't understand it
[2:09:48] where did it all go
[2:09:50] he gave it to the Lord
[2:09:52] and the government when they came and he
[2:09:56] was living and they came to his house
[2:09:58] and and they they talked to him and they
[2:10:01] looked around and

[2:15:06] is a plan there is a purpose but they're
[2:15:09] trying to in that book magazine they're
[2:15:11] trying to figure it all out why that's
[2:15:12] why this that's this where did that all

[2:15:19] get that where does this one get that
[2:15:20] and so on they didn't understand the
[2:15:23] plan and the purpose
[2:15:26] but thank God we had the plan and the
[2:15:28] purpose
[2:15:30] listen
[2:15:32] verse 26 said as it was in the days of
[2:15:35] Noah so shall it be in the days of the
[2:15:37] son of name
[2:15:39] let's recognize the hour of the Son of
[2:15:41] man were united with the son of man by
[2:15:44] the grace of Almighty God the bride and
[2:15:47] the bridegroom amen he's united as one
[2:15:52] brother that we have the we have the
[2:15:55] hunger and thirst that Luther had and we
[2:15:57] have hallelujah the rejoicing now
[2:15:59] because we got the revelation and that
[2:16:02] even that when Martin Luther had Wesley
[2:16:04] had and day and night the Pentecostals
[2:16:07] were rejoicing in the faith and they
[2:16:09] were
[2:16:10] the revealed truth the revelation of the
[2:16:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[2:16:16] of the Spirit oh they walked in it and
[2:16:18] they lived in it all praise the Lord
[2:16:20] morning noon and night do we think about
[2:16:23] the hour we are living and thinking
[2:16:25] about the resurrection and rapture could
[2:16:27] happen any minute now the whole body of
[2:16:30] the revealed truth in this age is a sign
[2:16:33] that the resurrection and rapture is
[2:16:35] about to climax all that God did was to
[2:16:39] give us resurrection and robbery faith
[2:16:42] it was to bring us into oneness with the
[2:16:44] son of man amen and
[2:16:48] giving us the resurrection rapturing
[2:16:50] faith because the son of man had the
[2:16:53] faith he said I got power
[2:16:56] here the word he said I got power oh
[2:17:01] you can do anything
[2:17:03] yes he said but I got power to lay my
[2:17:05] life down and to pick it up again
[2:17:09] well the bride's got power for the
[2:17:12] resurrection rapture and the change of
[2:17:14] the body
[2:17:16] because it's the son of man and
[2:17:19] the bride United is one
[2:17:23] but
[2:17:27] listen
[2:17:31] here not long ago when this first
[2:17:34] astronaut went up he come back and he
[2:17:37] hadn't seen nothing of God
[2:17:40] now they're seeing God they're seeing
[2:17:44] another creature they believe scientists
[2:17:47] are beginning to believe there is there
[2:17:48] was a creator science believed beginning
[2:17:51] to believe now that there's there's a
[2:17:52] power in control of the universe so is
[2:17:56] now believing that there's more in the
[2:17:58] in the universe than just us
[2:18:00] just think the prophet of God said it
[2:18:03] years ago and they're just getting to
[2:18:05] that now
[2:18:08] amen
[2:18:09] he said
[2:18:12] what the astronaut said about he's seen
[2:18:15] nothing of God he said that even turned
[2:18:18] ministers around
[2:18:20] are they gonna go back now based on what
[2:18:24] science is saying brother that's no
[2:18:26] salvation in that salvation is in what
[2:18:28] God said
[2:18:30] amen praise the Lord and he said
[2:18:33] education and wisdom of this world has
[2:18:37] turned the church into a bunch of rain
[2:18:39] weeds that's true a lot of message
[2:18:43] believers are rain weeds
[2:18:45] education the educational system science
[2:18:48] civilization is of the devil and he said
[2:18:51] our civilization is coming on we'll have
[2:18:54] nothing to do with this civilization he
[2:18:56] said it's nothing at all it'll be a
[2:18:58] different civilization and he said more
[2:19:01] science scientific we get further we go
[2:19:05] into death and he said they traps to
[2:19:09] kill so he said this civilization will
[2:19:12] had to be destroyed because it's of the
[2:19:15] devil we're going into God's what our
[2:19:18] civilization that's going to be I want
[2:19:21] you to do you just think about it take
[2:19:25] time sit down in meditation and pray and
[2:19:28] think about the civilization we're going
[2:19:30] into what it's going to be like you know
[2:19:33] we're not gonna have this clothes
[2:19:36] no gray hair no old men and women no
[2:19:39] young babies and so on just think about
[2:19:42] civilization the atmosphere what you're
[2:19:44] going we're gonna be doing something
[2:19:45] it's gonna be real
[2:19:47] talk you're gonna talk
[2:19:50] by the grace of God
[2:19:53] amen you talk about no one other
[2:19:56] thoughts
[2:19:58] there was there was a TV a television
[2:20:00] show on some years ago and in that show
[2:20:05] I want to say what it was but there was
[2:20:08] a
[2:20:09] couple of creatures that came out of
[2:20:11] space like they got from space and
[2:20:14] they didn't have to talk to one another
[2:20:18] they could communicate by thought
[2:20:22] now the earthly ones that were with them
[2:20:24] they had to talk to them
[2:20:27] for them to understand them but they
[2:20:30] didn't need but they knew what that what
[2:20:32] that earthly person people were talking
[2:20:34] about and they were that's something to
[2:20:36] do with going to space and all of that
[2:20:38] that's really meant this man and others
[2:20:42] and that you were just communicating
[2:20:45] back and forth thoughts and the others
[2:20:50] didn't know what they were communicating
[2:20:52] but we're getting it will communicate
[2:20:54] when we talk we're getting into the into
[2:20:57] that dimension just rig that just like
[2:20:59] that you Shrek travel as the thought oh
[2:21:02] yeah grace of God
[2:21:07] he said
[2:21:09] this civilization would be destroyed
[2:21:12] because it is of the devil we're going
[2:21:14] to God civilization and he said we find
[2:21:17] out in Genesis 4 that Cain's people
[2:21:19] started civilization Cain's they started
[2:21:23] building towns cities they said and so
[2:21:27] forth instruments of music and become
[2:21:30] insane and the people got further away
[2:21:33] from God yet religious and when Seth's
[2:21:37] people came out come on they begin to
[2:21:40] call on the name of the Lord because
[2:21:43] Seth oh
[2:21:45] yes people come on they call on the name
[2:21:48] of the Lord
[2:21:50] God sent Seth to replace Cain and we see
[2:21:55] where they are coming together now and I
[2:21:58] had the greater Kinetico council and so
[2:22:00] forth exactly fulfilling what the Bible
[2:22:03] said they would do they said it was the
[2:22:06] church not the Bible and the Bible is
[2:22:08] just a history of what the church did
[2:22:10] what a sub to lie that is it is a subtle
[2:22:15] thing of the devil brother but now
[2:22:19] they're beginning to realize that
[2:22:20] there's more to it than just the history
[2:22:23] of the church
[2:22:24] they said this this this is just too
[2:22:28] much dirt it's amazing the way it's
[2:22:31] written and what's written and so this
[2:22:33] day they said it's it's not not just a
[2:22:36] history book there's gotta be more to it
[2:22:38] we don't understand they said but it got
[2:22:40] any more to it
[2:22:42] God that God had mercy and he said God
[2:22:46] is going to judge the church judge the
[2:22:49] people someday we know that there's a
[2:22:52] judgement coming well that gentleman is
[2:22:54] here he's judging the world by his word
[2:22:56] and what's he going to judge it by he
[2:22:59] said he was judged by Christ and Christ
[2:23:01] is the word hallelujah so it's the Word
[2:23:06] of God that God will judge in the
[2:23:08] beginning was the word the Word was with
[2:23:10] God the Word was God the Word was made
[2:23:12] flesh and he'll judge it someday by His
[2:23:16] Word
[2:23:22] he said when I was speaking the other
[2:23:24] night at Shreveport and he said the
[2:23:27] communion when they killed the
[2:23:28] sacrificial lamb he said there was to be
[2:23:30] no leaven among them through the entire
[2:23:33] seven days no leaven no leaven bread
[2:23:36] everything had to be on eleven and that
[2:23:39] represented the seven church ages and he
[2:23:42] said that we get in the book here and
[2:23:44] they had to have the unleavened Word of
[2:23:46] God
[2:23:47] down to seven ages not
[2:23:50] mix with the thoughts of man
[2:23:54] grace brother that we have the on eleven
[2:23:57] Word of God for this hour and
[2:24:00] even what is eat today don't try to keep
[2:24:04] it for tomorrow burn it with fire before
[2:24:06] the daylight comes for there's a new
[2:24:09] message coming forth and a new thing and
[2:24:12] the public are highlighting the fact
[2:24:14] that everything is going is moving into
[2:24:16] the rapture
[2:24:17] the emphasis is the rapture he said you
[2:24:21] have no but you have noticed this has
[2:24:23] been a sweeping for twenty years now and
[2:24:26] there's no organization there never will
[2:24:29] be this is the end and he said the
[2:24:32] wheats come back to the wheat again and
[2:24:34] he said that we come back to its grain
[2:24:37] the shuck has pulled away from it and
[2:24:39] the wheat must lay in the presence of
[2:24:42] the Sun to be ripened and God is as what
[2:24:45] we're doing now we're laying in the
[2:24:47] president sunny God is ripening us for
[2:24:49] the resurrection and the rapture
[2:24:51] that's right
[2:24:54] there's nothing left now because the
[2:24:56] seed that was sown
[2:24:57] he's at the top what was sown is now at
[2:25:01] the top
[2:25:03] Amen so that you got a he's got to reap
[2:25:07] it he got to cut it down and he's got to
[2:25:09] let he kind of let let the stock and all
[2:25:11] the branches and all the limbs dad they
[2:25:14] got they got a decay but he's gonna he's
[2:25:17] going to gather the wheat into his
[2:25:18] garner I
[2:25:21] trust her that wheat
[2:25:23] praise the Lord
[2:25:26] he said don't you know he said the
[2:25:28] nation's are breaking and Israel is in
[2:25:31] her homeland and these signs are
[2:25:33] indicating that we are at the end but
[2:25:36] there shall be the light about the
[2:25:38] evening time and he said there will be a
[2:25:41] light come forth in the evening time
[2:25:43] when the blackout's and the things are
[2:25:45] going the way they are look at just now
[2:25:48] it blacked out and not only that
[2:25:51] spiritual but there were they were
[2:25:53] having natural blackouts electrically in
[2:25:56] America a
[2:25:58] man it was a typing the spiritual
[2:26:01] blackout but God was revealing the light
[2:26:04] of his word
[2:26:05] there's no blackout a
[2:26:07] man
[2:26:10] and it was in this area in this time
[2:26:14] when the prophet of God preached the
[2:26:16] rapture message in 1965 he said the Pope
[2:26:21] he said just come here
[2:26:26] and he should remember at the Tabernacle
[2:26:29] he said when you got them tapes I guess
[2:26:32] all of you take them know that the Lord
[2:26:34] showed there that day in the tabernacle
[2:26:37] exactly where those church ages would be
[2:26:39] and how they would be and I had them
[2:26:42] drawed it on the board up here them
[2:26:44] Church ages which you see trotted out in
[2:26:47] the book and if that only spirit didn't
[2:26:49] come down in a big pillar of fire and
[2:26:52] went right back there on he said on the
[2:26:55] wall and draw them out and they did
[2:26:57] after brother round finished the church
[2:26:59] ages the pillar fire came into venom
[2:27:02] tabernacle and went over and draught it
[2:27:03] on the wall the church ages amen there
[2:27:07] they are right there
[2:27:09] no radiator and the church and and the
[2:27:13] angel trotted it on the wall but this
[2:27:16] was all black and the proud of God said
[2:27:19] he said I put that wait there he said to
[2:27:22] represent the right
[2:27:24] amen but he said in in division he said
[2:27:28] it was all black grace of God brother
[2:27:30] and it is
[2:27:32] it is because as the problem brings that
[2:27:36] out and that our brother Andre brought
[2:27:39] it out that we are not in the church
[2:27:41] ages were in the bride age
[2:27:43] Amen
[2:27:46] there with me
[2:27:50] he said just says the Pope started over
[2:27:52] here he said the moon blacked out a
[2:27:56] man
[2:28:00] he said they took pictures the same way
[2:28:03] was draw tear upon the platform and he's
[2:28:05] made his trip over here on the 13th he
[2:28:08] said walked thirteen steps he said serve
[2:28:13] communion to certain people to a nation
[2:28:17] that's number thirteen and
[2:28:20] blackouts coming everywhere don't you
[2:28:23] see where we're at we are at the end
[2:28:25] time
[2:28:27] amen
[2:28:33] skip some of these things here and he
[2:28:36] said listen to the church the bride he
[2:28:38] said the rapture is a revelation
[2:28:42] it is revealed to her that the
[2:28:45] revelation the true Bride of Christ will
[2:28:48] be waiting for that revelation of the
[2:28:50] rapture now it is a revelation the
[2:28:53] revelation is faith and you cannot have
[2:28:57] a
[2:28:58] revelation without it being faith faith
[2:29:02] is a revelation because it's something
[2:29:04] that's revealed to you and faith is
[2:29:07] something that has been revealed to you
[2:29:09] like it was to Abraham and the church is
[2:29:13] built upon
[2:29:14] revelation a man the church goes by what
[2:29:19] God reveals to her not by what she's
[2:29:22] getting intellectually but by the Holy
[2:29:25] Ghost in her heart and soul amen
[2:29:30] so he's pointing to the rapture
[2:29:32] everything God did is pointing is giving
[2:29:34] us resurrection and rapturing faith
[2:29:36] because that's the climax of this bride
[2:29:39] age he said the book of the revelation
[2:29:42] is the last book of the Bible and it's
[2:29:45] sealed to unbelievers
[2:29:47] whosoever shall take one word or had one
[2:29:50] word is part of it take it out of the
[2:29:52] book of life he said it was altogether
[2:29:55] given for believers and it opens the
[2:29:59] book of Revelation and reveals who the
[2:30:01] author of this entire book is he is to
[2:30:04] look upon as Alpha and Omega from
[2:30:07] Genesis to Revelation
[2:30:08] Jesus Christ the same right straight
[2:30:11] through and reveals his complete mystery
[2:30:15] of himself and his plans for his church
[2:30:19] ages that is to come and will sealed in
[2:30:22] by seven seals
[2:30:25] but he said
[2:30:28] these seven seals was not to be opened
[2:30:32] revelation 10 until the sounding of the
[2:30:36] last earthly angel on earth
[2:30:39] revelation 10 and 7 amen and he said
[2:30:44] that's the age we are living in and God
[2:30:48] has what God has come down Christ came
[2:30:51] down the mighty angel with the rainbow
[2:30:54] over Zedd came down and through the
[2:30:56] messenger of revelation 10 he revealed
[2:30:59] the mystery of the seven seals and was
[2:31:02] to give the bride rapturing faith I've
[2:31:04] already shared with you the Revel the
[2:31:06] the quotes on the seven seals where the
[2:31:10] bride I'll the the prophet I lighted
[2:31:12] that it was to give us rapturing faith
[2:31:14] because that's what God's doing that's
[2:31:17] what God wants to bring back there's
[2:31:19] nothing else in this book there's
[2:31:21] nothing else for the Gentiles at the end
[2:31:24] of the Gentiles dispensation is the
[2:31:26] rapture and the Great Tribulation
[2:31:30] grace that were not here for the Great
[2:31:32] Tribulation
[2:31:34] grace that he's taking us out and he is
[2:31:38] giving us the resurrection and rapture
[2:31:39] in faith now and if you got it you won't
[2:31:42] forget it and you got it you won't
[2:31:45] ignore it you got it you won't be able
[2:31:46] to get away from it why because God is
[2:31:49] right there with you
[2:31:51] the Holy Ghost is right there to make
[2:31:54] you at the revelation one and you're
[2:31:56] gone
[2:31:57] but as many believers God sent a prophet
[2:32:01] and the mystery of the seals was opened
[2:32:03] but the reality of it is not in them
[2:32:07] they got thoughts in their heads but
[2:32:09] they don't have revelation in their
[2:32:11] heart
[2:32:15] he said the revelation is to reveal the
[2:32:17] truth it is to make it fit with the rest
[2:32:21] of the scriptures so he said God don't
[2:32:24] need no one to interpret it he said God
[2:32:27] is his own interpreter and he interprets
[2:32:30] it he said by bringing it to pass so
[2:32:33] he's he bring them the resurrection and
[2:32:34] rapture the past in your life
[2:32:36] amen because everything that God has
[2:32:39] done is all coming down to the
[2:32:42] resurrection rapture
[2:32:46] all that God was doing in Luther's day
[2:32:48] came down to justification by faith
[2:32:51] sanctification by faith the baptism of
[2:32:54] the Holy Ghost by faith the gifts of the
[2:32:56] Spirit by all by faith now it's the rat
[2:32:59] resurrection of rapture by faith
[2:33:04] when the bride is being called out are
[2:33:07] you going to put it it's the revelation
[2:33:10] of the manifestation of the word made
[2:33:12] true and we're living in that day praise
[2:33:14] be to God he said the revelation of the
[2:33:17] mystery of himself
[2:33:19] now he said the rapture
[2:33:22] is only this rapture that we're talking
[2:33:25] about is only for the bride if there's
[2:33:30] not a rapture friends where are we at
[2:33:32] what are we going to do what age are we
[2:33:36] living in what promise do we have there
[2:33:39] is going to be a rapture
[2:33:41] amen he said the bride is the one that's
[2:33:47] going to be raptured
[2:33:48] that alone nothing but the bride the
[2:33:52] elected four known by God from the
[2:33:55] beginning of
[2:33:57] the father's spiritual gene it's the
[2:34:01] bride that's going in the rapture the
[2:34:04] question is are you bride or just a
[2:34:06] religious figure I
[2:34:08] trust that we are bright
[2:34:11] and
[2:34:13] they meant and and the evidence of the
[2:34:17] bride is separation
[2:34:20] you're separate under the Lord
[2:34:24] you mean
[2:34:29] the body of Jesus Christ the bride will
[2:34:33] be part of his body he was the word and
[2:34:37] the bride will have to be the word word
[2:34:40] added to word added to word and he said
[2:34:44] Luther Wesley Pentecost it's got to be
[2:34:48] the word on top of word germ on top of
[2:34:51] germ and he said life on top of life to
[2:34:55] bring the full stature of the bride of
[2:34:58] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:35:07] now he said the question is how do we
[2:35:11] get into that right
[2:35:13] many say join our congregation one of
[2:35:17] the ones a certain type of baptism one
[2:35:20] wants to do this or that one said you
[2:35:23] must speak with tongues the other said
[2:35:25] you have to do this this one says that
[2:35:28] you must dance in the spirit and he said
[2:35:32] this one says you you you must do this
[2:35:34] this is this has got a sensation all
[2:35:38] right and then still it's all wrong how
[2:35:42] could a man or a woman or a child of God
[2:35:46] that's born to the Spirit of God deny
[2:35:48] the word of God
[2:35:50] you want to neither work definitely not
[2:35:56] amen
[2:35:58] Jesus
[2:36:00] wants the fruit of himself his wife must
[2:36:03] bring forth the fruit of a kind of
[2:36:06] children that he is
[2:36:08] amen bride children word children not
[2:36:14] denominational
[2:36:16] amen grace of God
[2:36:23] to highlight something right here and
[2:36:27] try to bring it to a conclusion
[2:36:32] listen to what he said
[2:36:35] it might cause some to question whether
[2:36:38] or not he was a problem whether or not
[2:36:40] it was God
[2:36:43] he said we find here that
[2:36:46] Enoch
[2:36:48] was the seventh from
[2:36:53] Noah
[2:36:55] that's what he said and he said it all
[2:36:59] the way through time and time and time
[2:37:02] again
[2:37:02] I'm defining in the next message or
[2:37:07] second or third message after he
[2:37:09] corrected himself
[2:37:11] he said I said Noah but he saw it meant
[2:37:13] Enoch with the salmon from the had a
[2:37:16] first Adam
[2:37:18] but here he said Noah so I'll just
[2:37:23] insert Adam in the quote he said find
[2:37:27] that he not was a seventh from Adam the
[2:37:30] first Adam which was a type of the
[2:37:32] church ages and now all the rest of the
[2:37:36] six men before him died but Enoch was
[2:37:39] translated Enoch was raptured the
[2:37:42] seventh showing that it is the seventh
[2:37:44] church age that takes the rapture now
[2:37:47] there is no doubt we're in the seventh
[2:37:49] church age now it's the seventh church
[2:37:52] age that takes the rapture and all the
[2:37:55] other six died Enoch was translated
[2:37:58] because he was not found God took him
[2:38:01] God raptured him amen a type of the rest
[2:38:06] of them dying the end time bride will be
[2:38:10] called out of the rapturing without
[2:38:14] death will be called out of the seven
[2:38:17] churches which are now bearing record of
[2:38:19] that age amen let's dig in real deep
[2:38:24] amen how many are digging into the
[2:38:26] message if you are it's gonna reflect in
[2:38:30] your life
[2:38:31] amen
[2:38:33] so revelation 10 that great mystery of
[2:38:36] the book was to be unfolded by the
[2:38:39] seventh angels message amen so what God
[2:38:43] has done was for the purpose
[2:38:46] to bring it to a climax of the
[2:38:48] resurrection in the rapture we recognize
[2:38:53] the theme of Luther's message Westridge
[2:38:56] message the Pentecostal message do we
[2:38:58] recognize the theme of the message of
[2:39:01] Malachi 4 and the revelation of the Son
[2:39:04] of Man brother is the coming of the son
[2:39:06] of man
[2:39:08] for the bride and history and their
[2:39:12] opening of the seals the mystery of God
[2:39:14] is to give the bride rapturing faith
[2:39:16] well I was he giving eruption faith it's
[2:39:19] going from the beginning to the end and
[2:39:21] you see in the end you see that God did
[2:39:24] this God did this to earth he gave them
[2:39:26] faith faith faith faith no he's at the
[2:39:28] end he's giving us a resurrection
[2:39:30] rupturing paint
[2:39:31] amen
[2:39:33] praise the Lord
[2:39:36] God's not just looking for justification
[2:39:38] faith sanctification faith or the
[2:39:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost Face you we
[2:39:43] got a habit and the bright will have it
[2:39:45] but now he's looking for
[2:39:48] rapture in faith
[2:39:51] grace
[2:39:55] I'll finish in a few moments here
[2:40:02] he said there was three watches the
[2:40:04] first watch 9:00 to 12:00 the second
[2:40:08] 12:00 to 3:00 the third three to six now
[2:40:12] he said we got three there's three
[2:40:15] es which is a nine an imperfect number
[2:40:20] then we come back to the seven for the
[2:40:23] rapture which will take place I believe
[2:40:27] between six and seven o'clock
[2:40:29] or he said six and nine o'clock some
[2:40:34] morning for the trumpet shall sound
[2:40:38] Amen the trumpet is sounded I
[2:40:41] believe that but he mentioned with the
[2:40:45] trumpet sounding just bear with me here
[2:40:53] praise the Lord
[2:41:09] Peola show you a mystery we shall not
[2:41:12] all sleep but
[2:41:14] we shall be changed in a moment in the
[2:41:19] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[2:41:24] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[2:41:27] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[2:41:29] shall be changed
[2:41:32] amen and tehsil that was first
[2:41:36] Corinthians 15 and
[2:41:38] in first Thessalonians the Lord himself
[2:41:41] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[2:41:42] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[2:41:45] Trump of God and the Trump shall sound
[2:41:48] and the dead shall be raised
[2:41:50] incorruptible
[2:41:51] praise the Lord thank God
[2:41:56] for the revelation of what he is doing
[2:41:59] and we pray by grace through faith that
[2:42:02] we're part of what he's doing that we
[2:42:05] are on our way to eternity that we are
[2:42:08] on our way to into the change of our
[2:42:10] bodies by the grace of God
[2:42:15] he said three things happen
[2:42:19] reading that 1st Thessalonians 4 he said
[2:42:23] a shout a voice a trumpet
[2:42:26] has to happen before Jesus appears
[2:42:30] Jesus does all three of them he said
[2:42:34] when he's descending a shout
[2:42:37] he said it's the message going forth and
[2:42:42] he said the living bread of life
[2:42:44] bringing forth the bride
[2:42:47] amen we are here because of the shout
[2:42:51] amen and we're entering in to the
[2:42:55] trumpet
[2:42:57] for the rapture
[2:42:59] he said in Amos 3 he said he would do
[2:43:04] nothing on earth until he revealed at
[2:43:06] first to his servants the prophets and
[2:43:08] just as certain as he promised it he'll
[2:43:10] do it and we have come to the church
[2:43:13] ages but were promised in the last days
[2:43:15] Malachi 4 that there would be to return
[2:43:18] again a prophet in the land and God uses
[2:43:21] the spirit five time once in Elijah
[2:43:24] Elijah John the Baptist's he said called
[2:43:28] out the church the remnant of the Jews
[2:43:30] five times grace he said Jesus
[2:43:35] Jes us five if a ith five not letters
[2:43:40] it's the number of grace a man
[2:43:44] praise the name of the Lord and he uses
[2:43:47] the Elijah ministry five times that's
[2:43:50] the grace of God
[2:43:52] the Elijah ministry represents
[2:43:54] deliverance and he said he would send
[2:43:58] the Prophet raised him up from nowhere
[2:44:00] and he's to belong to none other
[2:44:02] situations and speak his word he said
[2:44:06] call off the scene and God just rugged
[2:44:08] man of the truth of God
[2:44:13] amen
[2:44:20] God has ordained these things to be he
[2:44:23] must send this the first thing come when
[2:44:27] he starts descending from heaven is a
[2:44:29] shout what is it it's a message to get
[2:44:33] the people together
[2:44:35] and message comes forth and he said I am
[2:44:39] trimming time rise trim your lamps watch
[2:44:44] what happens
[2:44:46] he said the seventh the sixth the
[2:44:48] seventh and he said behold the
[2:44:50] bridegroom cometh rise and trim your
[2:44:52] lamps and they did some of them found
[2:44:55] they didn't even have any oil in their
[2:44:56] lamps but its lamp trimming time it's
[2:45:00] Malachi four time when you come its Luke
[2:45:03] 17
[2:45:05] amen brother let's make sure we got the
[2:45:09] extra oil to trim our lamps this is why
[2:45:13] the prophet of God said it's going to
[2:45:14] take a double portion of the Holy Ghost
[2:45:16] to get us into the rapture why because
[2:45:19] the the original portion in our lamps is
[2:45:22] keeping us going separating us onto the
[2:45:24] Lord but then comes the hour of the
[2:45:26] resurrection of the rapture we need that
[2:45:28] extra L to get in through the door a man
[2:45:31] that foolish virgin never added that's
[2:45:34] why she goes through the Great
[2:45:35] Tribulation but the wise version had the
[2:45:38] extra oil a man and the foolish virgin
[2:45:41] came assist give us some of your old Oh
[2:45:43] so we only got enough for ourselves to
[2:45:45] get him see it's between you and God
[2:45:47] do you have rapture in faith a man yeah
[2:45:52] and that that brother that sister can't
[2:45:55] share that faith with you God gives us
[2:45:57] the word to give us all that faith so
[2:46:00] it's according to its the way you're
[2:46:02] receiving the word the way you're
[2:46:03] treating the worst your attitude toward
[2:46:05] the word
[2:46:06] amen and I tell you if you've got that
[2:46:09] faith or you you're short in your
[2:46:11] attitude your spirit your testimony
[2:46:14] you're sure you have that faith a man
[2:46:21] he said the main articles or the main
[2:46:24] heart of what God has done is the
[2:46:26] message and so on
[2:46:31] I'll let the finish with this
[2:46:37] each there's a shout a messenger getting
[2:46:40] the people ready the second is the voice
[2:46:43] of the resurrection
[2:46:46] calling the dead fourth
[2:46:48] and he said John 11 that called Lazarus
[2:46:52] from the grave gave the bride together
[2:46:55] then the resurrection of the dead to be
[2:46:58] caught up and he said watch the three
[2:47:00] things taking place now he's the third
[2:47:04] thing is a trumpet which always at the
[2:47:06] Feast of Trumpets is calling the people
[2:47:08] to the feast and that will be the
[2:47:11] marriage supper
[2:47:13] hallelujah he said the lamb suffered
[2:47:16] with the bride in the sky see the first
[2:47:19] thing comes forth is his message calling
[2:47:21] the bride together the next thing is a
[2:47:25] resurrection of the sleeping bride and
[2:47:27] the one that's died back in the other
[2:47:29] ages were cut up together and we are
[2:47:33] right there ready now and the only thing
[2:47:37] the church come he asked to lay before
[2:47:39] the Sun to ripen oh
[2:47:42] I pray God we are getting more and more
[2:47:44] ripe in our faith
[2:47:47] all the time he said knowing back there
[2:47:50] under healing and so forth was just to
[2:47:53] catch the people's attention knowing the
[2:47:55] message would come and here it is them
[2:47:58] seven seals open those mysteries showing
[2:48:01] the things what's happened a man it's
[2:48:04] giving the bride rapturing faith because
[2:48:07] the bride knows that's the only thing
[2:48:09] left to come to pass
[2:48:12] in the sight of God the bride is
[2:48:16] justified she never done it in the first
[2:48:18] place a man standing there married to
[2:48:21] the virtuous son of God never sinned in
[2:48:25] the first place she was foreordained she
[2:48:28] was trapped into this and now when she
[2:48:31] heard the truth and come forth the blood
[2:48:33] cleansed her and she stands there
[2:48:36] virtuous and there's no sin at all
[2:48:41] the message caused the bride together
[2:48:45] the voice wakes up the sleeping bride
[2:48:48] the sleeping dead a man
[2:48:52] grace of God
[2:48:55] we have had three witnesses there is a
[2:48:57] witness we've already had three
[2:49:00] witnesses in the Old Testament
[2:49:01] now watch Enoch Elijah Jesus
[2:49:08] Jesus being the keystone
[2:49:11] between the old and new Testament he was
[2:49:15] the keystone that ties two together and
[2:49:20] he read
[2:49:23] Matthew 27
[2:49:28] and it says and the graves were open and
[2:49:31] many many of the saints that slept the
[2:49:34] rose and he said that came out of the
[2:49:37] graves after his resurrection and went
[2:49:39] into the holy city and appeared unto
[2:49:41] many well brother in this hour there's a
[2:49:44] resurrection and a rapture but it's
[2:49:47] going to be as a thief in the night
[2:49:50] 1 rapturous past and he said there's
[2:49:55] he's three threes happened in the Old
[2:49:58] Testament
[2:50:00] Enoch
[2:50:02] raptured Elijah raptured jesus raptured
[2:50:07] he's who watched the Old Testament them
[2:50:10] Old Testament Saints and he said now
[2:50:12] when this rapture first taken place
[2:50:14] notice verse 50 his loud voice awaken
[2:50:18] the Old Testament Saints just exactly
[2:50:20] the loud voice awakened Jesus or wake
[2:50:23] wake Lazarus rather he said the loud
[2:50:26] voice awakened and the second is
[2:50:28] fulfilled in think in
[2:50:30] Thessalonians 4
[2:50:34] he said that will be the second rapture
[2:50:37] will be the catching away of the bright
[2:50:40] and brother all that God has done is to
[2:50:43] give us that faith is not just a correct
[2:50:47] us in this doctrine that doctrine that's
[2:50:49] something else not yes it that's all
[2:50:51] part of it but it is there the end
[2:50:55] result is faith for the rapture when we
[2:50:58] see what God has done what God is doing
[2:51:00] giving us wrapping faith oh Lord
[2:51:04] it's finished it's the end yes it's over
[2:51:08] get ready look up
[2:51:10] look up we're going to the marriage
[2:51:13] supper praise the Lord thank God
[2:51:21] and he said there's one rap should
[2:51:23] already pass and we're looking for that
[2:51:25] last rapture of the Rite of Christ their
[2:51:28] bridegroom was raptured now the
[2:51:29] brightest being raptured amen
[2:51:36] and he talked about his last vision of
[2:51:40] the elect of God of the bride and what
[2:51:44] was the last thing he said to her in his
[2:51:47] last vision
[2:51:49] stay in light
[2:51:52] because he did see in the end he saw a
[2:51:55] couple stepping out of line and that's
[2:51:59] when he screamed and he said stay in
[2:52:00] line
[2:52:02] and there's many getting at a line when
[2:52:06] it comes to the message and that's why
[2:52:08] the true ministry is gonna be screaming
[2:52:10] stay in line
[2:52:13] he said the vision left me and I was
[2:52:16] standing in the room screaming he said
[2:52:19] stay in line I wonder could it be
[2:52:23] already past could the bride already be
[2:52:26] called and is that what we're going
[2:52:28] through today she has to be molded and
[2:52:31] made into the image of Christ and Christ
[2:52:33] is the word a
[2:52:35] man thank God Christ is the word
[2:52:44] he said the bride is a part of the
[2:52:46] bridegroom the woman is a part of her
[2:52:48] husband because she's taken out of out
[2:52:51] of the husband he was part of Adam from
[2:52:53] his sight and so is the bride not taken
[2:52:56] from denomination but taken from the
[2:52:59] bosom of the Word of God for this day
[2:53:02] he said god bless you it's been spoken
[2:53:05] it has to come to pass he said and
[2:53:09] little people no one wants to die
[2:53:12] no one wants to be lost let me tell you
[2:53:15] whatever you do I don't care I well you
[2:53:17] go to church Royal you are to church he
[2:53:21] said that's fine nothing against that
[2:53:23] you should go to church you should do
[2:53:26] that keep on going to church but
[2:53:28] whatever it is throw away your
[2:53:31] traditions and move right on up into
[2:53:33] Christ amen
[2:53:36] remember we are in the last hours it is
[2:53:42] it is the time of the resurrection it is
[2:53:46] the time of the rapture we live in a
[2:53:48] tremendous day tremendous age what
[2:53:53] we're not just rejoicing over this this
[2:53:56] doctrine that doctrine this one but
[2:53:58] something God is doing just think the
[2:54:01] resurrection rapture what Jesus did
[2:54:04] 2,000 years ago now he's in the bride
[2:54:06] doing it
[2:54:07] laying his life down picking it up
[2:54:10] praise the Lord we lay our lives down to
[2:54:12] the world the things of the world people
[2:54:15] of the world amen we're living for Jesus
[2:54:17] by the grace of God we are like Enoch we
[2:54:21] are walking with God and what does it
[2:54:24] mean it says he lived as one whose eye
[2:54:27] was continually upon God you couldn't if
[2:54:33] you're walking with God you can't forget
[2:54:34] God and
[2:54:36] it says
[2:54:37] whose care and content constant course
[2:54:41] and business was to please God as he is
[2:54:46] walking with God and
[2:54:47] to imitate God and to maintain
[2:54:51] acquaintance and communion with God as
[2:54:54] one devoted to God's service he was
[2:54:59] completely governed by God's will
[2:55:03] that's Enoch walking with God
[2:55:07] not his will but God's will he lived for
[2:55:11] God
[2:55:12] amen he would have died for God God knew
[2:55:16] that and God raptured him because he had
[2:55:19] already laid down his life for the Lord
[2:55:22] they made it already laid down his life
[2:55:25] for God and the things of God I pray
[2:55:27] grace the brother/sister we've laid down

[2:56:23] with the world and insanity can be very
[2:56:27] simple oh
[2:56:29] yeah just the simplicity of ignoring
[2:56:32] reality
[2:56:34] that's insanity and you can add that you
[2:56:38] could add that insanity to ignore the
[2:56:39] reality of that that spirit or that
[2:56:41] spirit and it can be you see God has
[2:56:44] hidden revealing simplicity but the
[2:56:45] devil's trying to imitate God and and
[2:56:49] he'll he'll hide himself in simplicity
[2:56:50] and try to make you believe that it's
