[41:07] very familiar scripture says the spirit
[41:09] of the Lord is upon me because the Lord
[41:13] ha anointed me to preach Good Tidings
[41:15] unto the meek he has sent me to bind up
[41:17] the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to
[41:20] the captives and the opening of the
[41:22] prison to them that are bound this is
[41:24] 700 years before Christ comes along and
[41:27] we know that then he comes along and he
[41:28] reads that in the synagogue and he says
[41:30] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[41:33] your ears amen and that scripture has
[41:35] been open ever since that scripture has
[41:37] been open that prophecy has been opened
[41:39] and nothing has changed then we come to
[41:41] Luke chap 13 Luke 13 and verse
[41:55] 11
[41:59] Jesus says in Luke 13:11 he says and
[42:02] behold there was a woman with which had
[42:04] a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was
[42:08] bowed together and could in no wise lift
[42:11] herself up now she had a spirit of
[42:13] infirmity that meant that she was kind
[42:16] of crippled up she was bent over but you
[42:19] know there's people that have spirits of
[42:21] infirmity you know there's a person I
[42:23] know and and it seems like every time
[42:26] something happens in their body they've
[42:27] got the world's worst disease and the
[42:29] absolute worst possible thing it could
[42:31] be is what they believe it is it's a
[42:33] spirit of infirmity it's a spirit of
[42:35] Torment that tells that person that
[42:37] anytime you get sick it's something
[42:39] serious it's something bad it's
[42:41] something horrible it's something that's
[42:42] going to kill you it's something that's
[42:43] going to keep you in your bed for 10
[42:45] days and you're never going to feel the
[42:47] same again in these different things
[42:48] Satan likes to get in our in our way
[42:50] that way he likes to send a a spirit to
[42:53] torment us that what the the absolute
[42:55] worst that could happen is what's going
[42:57] to happen to us that's a spirit of
[42:59] infirmity as well it's not what this
[43:01] woman has but that's a hypochondriac
[43:04] somebody that thinks that anything that
[43:06] can go wrong will go wrong and when
[43:07] something goes wrong it's the worst
[43:08] thing amen don't ever let Satan jump
[43:10] into you like that amen we believe the
[43:13] word that by his stripes we are healed
[43:14] no matter what it is and it's not
[43:16] allowed to stay amen it says but when
[43:20] Jesus saw her he called her to him and
[43:23] said unto her Heroman thou are loosed
[43:27] from thine infirmity so Jesus had read
[43:29] that the spirit of the Lord was upon him
[43:31] and now he comes to a woman and he calls
[43:33] her out and he delivers her it says and
[43:37] he laid his hands on her and immediately
[43:39] she was made straight and glorified god
[43:42] let's turn to 2 Corinthians
[43:47] 3 2 Corinthians 3 and verse1
[43:55] 17 says now the Lord is that spirit and
[43:59] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[44:02] Liberty see it didn't die with Christ it
[44:05] didn't stay with Jesus the prophecy
[44:07] continues amen it continued with the
[44:10] Holy Spirit and it's here today even now
[44:13] until the end of the age to have the
[44:14] same effect in our lives it says but we
[44:17] all with open face beholding as in a
[44:19] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[44:22] into the same image from glory to glory
[44:25] even by the spirit of the Lord where's
[44:28] our
[44:29] Liberty where's the Liberty we look here
[44:32] it says that it's the changing of Our
[44:34] Lives it's the changing of us from the
[44:36] natural into the spiritual it's the
[44:39] changing of us from what we were born as
[44:42] Humanity into what we have been told to
[44:44] be by the word of God it says our
[44:46] freedom is in our word position in
[44:50] Christ amen that we may be changed even
[44:53] as by the spirit of the Lord amen you
[44:56] can have your seats this morning God
[44:58] bless you each one anden we're turning
[45:01] another Corner this morning and we're
[45:02] still talking about the charity that
[45:04] that we've been talking about but I want
[45:06] to take a title this morning of the
[45:08] spirit of freedom and we're going to I
[45:10] think we're going to spend some time on
[45:11] this the Lord knows I've got plenty of
[45:13] notes and studying a lot on this but you
[45:15] know as it is you only touch the surface
[45:17] so many times but I want to tell you
[45:19] this morning I'm here to encourage you
[45:20] I'm here to strengthen you I'm here to
[45:22] to build up your faith this morning
[45:24] because we've spoken how long we've been
[45:26] in a time of restoration Redemption if
[45:28] you remember we did a series that was 47
[45:30] Services long we talked about the the
[45:32] times of restoration and Redemption and
[45:34] and the purpose of God releasing the the
[45:37] Holy Ghost to the believer and the
[45:38] purpose of the Holy Ghost is to produce
[45:40] the Living Word that's what it's to do
[45:42] is to produce the Living Word whatever
[45:44] your portion is it's to make it live
[45:46] inside of your life amen but the
[45:47] apostles saw Falling Away of that power
[45:50] even in their time and remember they
[45:52] talked about wolves and sheep clothing
[45:54] it says they they they are going to to
[45:56] come and they even are now and we're
[45:57] seeing these things and they saw the
[45:59] drop off of the church but now we've got
[46:01] a time and we're in a a season where
[46:03] there's a restoration back to what they
[46:06] had in that original time amen and it's
[46:08] the power of the Holy Ghost by the full
[46:10] word of God to produce what he said
[46:12] would happen inside of this age amen
[46:14] we've talked about what charity is it's
[46:16] divine love it's the love of God but
[46:18] it's not just that it's the nature it's
[46:20] the person of God to make the word live
[46:22] in our life the way it's supposed to and
[46:25] we've talked about what it makes us do
[46:26] towards other people and we talked about
[46:28] how it is patient and it's kind and it
[46:30] can bear all things and it can endure
[46:32] all things and and it doesn't lash out
[46:35] in these different things but I want to
[46:36] start to talk about what it does for us
[46:39] as in what it does for me and what it
[46:40] does for you and your life the personal
[46:42] benefits of this what it does in your
[46:44] mind in your spirit in your family in
[46:46] your relationships in your work in your
[46:48] house in your body all of these things
[46:51] about what would happen if we'd let the
[46:53] Holy Ghost have its way in those things
[46:54] because the Holy Ghost is here to remove
[46:57] every hindrance to you living an
[47:00] overcoming
[47:01] life amen it's a it's a door
[47:04] opener it's a wall
[47:07] breaker and it's a chain relasing power
[47:10] for the for the for the believer today
[47:12] amen listen there when you get the Holy
[47:15] Ghost you may have fought battles all
[47:17] your life you may have issues you may
[47:19] have complexes you may may may have
[47:22] things that you have never won the
[47:23] battle over but when God gives you the
[47:25] Holy Ghost it is that you could overcome
[47:28] every single thing that Satan has placed
[47:31] in your life
[47:32] Baron that's it it is total overcoming
[47:36] power amen now I want to set us up this
[47:38] morning with with a quote and I've read
[47:40] this way way back when but I want to
[47:43] just kind of set a tone again this
[47:44] morning on this brother Braham said
[47:46] Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt
[47:49] is the world that they come out of the
[47:51] Wilderness is where they were Sanctified
[47:53] a Sanctified called out Church Canan is
[47:56] where they settle down with the holy
[47:58] spirit cuz they still have wars they
[48:00] were saying that that it was a type of
[48:02] the Millennium he said or or the you
[48:05] know when all things are made new he
[48:06] says no they still got Wars he says if
[48:08] you don't believe you have wars just get
[48:10] the Holy Spirit once amen that's the
[48:12] start of war not the end of War he says
[48:15] but what are you doing what do you do in
[48:17] Canaan they were possessing their rights
[48:21] he says glory and they could not possess
[48:23] their rights until they got into Canaan
[48:25] he didn't say they didn't have rights
[48:27] before Canaan he said they couldn't
[48:28] possess rights until they got into
[48:30] Canaan because Canaan was where their
[48:32] rights were he says when they come into
[48:34] Canaan he says they didn't know nothing
[48:36] in the wilderness then when they come
[48:38] into Canaan then they had
[48:40] rights they had the promise all along
[48:43] but it was only in Canaan that they
[48:45] could receive what God had promised he
[48:47] says and we've got rights he says when
[48:49] you receive the Holy Ghost you're in
[48:51] Canaan you have to fight for it every
[48:54] inch of ground you have to fight for it
[48:57] yes sir so when God gives you the Holy
[48:59] Ghost when he seals your soul to the day
[49:01] of redemption what is it he's doing he's
[49:03] drawing the battle lines because you've
[49:06] made your commitment to him he's made
[49:08] his commitment to you he's put the seal
[49:10] on his soul and now you're identified
[49:12] you're identified which side you're on
[49:14] there's no doubt about it anymore Satan
[49:16] knows you're not on his side God knows
[49:18] your form Satan knows you're against him
[49:21] and so now every gun in hell is trying
[49:23] to hold you back from every promise in
[49:25] this word did you know there's some
[49:27] promises in this word you can't have
[49:29] till you get the Holy Ghost absolutely
[49:32] absolutely there are things that you
[49:33] cannot have there are things you cannot
[49:35] produce until you get the Holy Ghost
[49:37] because it takes the life the nature the
[49:39] character of Christ in you to produce
[49:41] those and put them in the way that
[49:42] they're supposed to be in your life amen
[49:45] but that's just a starting point because
[49:47] we're in this time of restoration
[49:48] Redemption and we've got things that are
[49:50] in the word for us and it takes the Holy
[49:52] Ghost to bring victory in our lives in
[49:54] certain things it takes the indwelling
[49:56] presence of God so let's go back to the
[49:58] scripture this morning as we set this up
[50:00] in Deuteronomy 31 it says and Moses
[50:03] called unto Joshua and said unto him in
[50:05] the sight of all Israel be strong and of
[50:08] a good courage for thou must go with
[50:11] this people under the lamb which the
[50:12] Lord has sworn under their fathers to
[50:14] give them and thou shalt cause them to
[50:17] inherit it Thou shalt cause them to
[50:19] inherit it Joshua was a type of the
[50:21] leadership of the Holy Spirit if you've
[50:23] got the holy spirit in your life will
[50:26] cause you to inherit the word Promises
[50:28] of God it's not going to hold back the
[50:31] holy spirit is not static it's not
[50:33] stagnant but it's a life force it's a
[50:35] pressure and it's something that's
[50:37] pulling you and it's pushing you into
[50:38] the promises of the word of God for you
[50:41] it says and the Lord he it is sorry yes
[50:44] and the Lord he it is that doth go
[50:46] before thee who's leading the way
[50:49] brother John he is he will be with thee
[50:53] he will not fail thee neither forsake
[50:55] thee fear not neither be dismayed
[50:57] where's our rest Church our rest is that
[51:00] he goes before us that he will be with
[51:02] us that he will fight for us that he
[51:04] gives us strength that he gives us F
[51:06] courage that he takes away all doubt
[51:08] amen the Holy Ghost is the power for the
[51:11] Christian walk you stand by the Holy
[51:14] Ghost and you fall without it you've got
[51:17] to have it to walk this fight amen
[51:19] you've got to swing the sword but he
[51:21] gives you the weapon that'll cut amen
[51:24] you've got to walk forward but but God
[51:25] is the one that makes the enemies fall
[51:27] before you it's the power of God in you
[51:31] that makes you do these things it's the
[51:33] power of God that makes your enemies
[51:34] fall before you that makes the walls
[51:36] come down that opens the doors that
[51:38] makes a way where there is no way amen
[51:41] he says fear not be dismayed don't look
[51:44] at them look at me look at the one
[51:46] that's going before you you've got to be
[51:48] able to see God you've got to be able to
[51:50] see what God's doing in your life you've
[51:52] got to be able to see the leadership
[51:53] you've got to be able to see the Promise
[51:55] you've got to know that you're where he
[51:56] wants you to be Deuteronomy 11 he says
[52:00] then will the Lord drive out all these
[52:02] nations before you he's the
[52:04] power he says and ye shall possess
[52:07] greater Nations and mightier than
[52:09] yourselves we're the ones that get the
[52:10] benefit of his work we're the ones that
[52:12] get the benefit of his power now guess
[52:14] what the power of the holy spirit in you
[52:16] looks a lot like work cuz you've still
[52:19] got to fight you've got to put your
[52:21] faith to the test you've got to put your
[52:23] life on the line but it's the power of
[52:25] the Holy Ghost that makes them fall he
[52:27] says it's going to be people that are
[52:29] greater than you that are mightier than
[52:31] you that have more than you that have
[52:33] been trained better than you but they
[52:35] will fall at your feet because I'm the
[52:37] one that fights for you you're going to
[52:39] face cancer but it'll go you're going to
[52:42] face doubts but it'll go you're going to
[52:44] face complexes but I'll defeat them
[52:47] you're going to face troubles and trials
[52:48] you're going to need things but I'll
[52:50] deliver and I'll provide and I'll do all
[52:51] that you need he's the one that's going
[52:54] to do it amen
[52:55] they've been the things that we've been
[52:57] hold held back from so long have to come
[53:00] to us by the power of the Holy Spirit
[53:02] Satan's been camped out on your rights
[53:04] for a very long time and it takes the
[53:07] Holy Ghost to move him off now watch
[53:10] what he says every place whereon The
[53:13] Souls of your feet shall tread shall be
[53:15] yours from the Wilderness in Lebanon
[53:18] from the river the river Euphrates even
[53:20] unto the uttermost sea shall your Coast
[53:22] be now notice he says every place that's
[53:25] an absolute but it's every place within
[53:28] the boundaries that I lay out so you got
[53:31] to be in God's boundaries not in your
[53:33] own boundaries Israel's never bless when
[53:36] they try and expand their
[53:38] land God's laid out a boundary Church
[53:41] he's given us a word and as long as you
[53:43] stay within the word
[53:45] everywhere that the soul of your foot
[53:47] will tread Belongs to You amen we've got
[53:51] to find our place in the word and stay
[53:54] there cuz that's where Victory is amen
[53:57] you got to stay with the word because
[53:58] that's our
[53:59] inheritance he says every place where on
[54:01] the souls of your feet shall tread shall
[54:03] be yours there shall no man be able to
[54:06] stand before you for the Lord your God
[54:09] shall lay the fear of you and the dread
[54:11] of you upon all the land that you shall
[54:13] tread upon as he has said unto you
[54:17] notice God's using absolutes God's the
[54:19] only one that can use absolutes because
[54:20] he's the only
[54:21] absolute we can't do it I can't say
[54:25] every and no
[54:27] none but God can and he says every place
[54:32] you walk that means without
[54:34] exception everywhere you go in the word
[54:37] of God belongs to you if you got faith
[54:39] to go there it belongs to you and then
[54:42] he says no man not a single one that
[54:45] means everything you face Must Fall at
[54:48] your feet by the power of the Holy Ghost
[54:52] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[54:54] build their faith up cuz if your faith
[54:55] gets built up your feet will follow if
[54:57] your faith gets built up your life will
[54:59] follow if your faith gets built up your
[55:02] confession will follow and all of a
[55:03] sudden you can start walking into the
[55:05] word of God and into the promises that
[55:07] you've never gone before listen to what
[55:09] the prophet of God said he said and when
[55:11] God gave Israel the promised land while
[55:13] they were still in Egypt they had to
[55:14] fight for every inch of that land God
[55:17] told Joshua and Joshua 1 wherever The
[55:19] Souls of your foot Treads upon that I've
[55:21] given you for a possession so Footprints
[55:24] means POS possession some people can
[55:26] just get barely to the edge of the land
[55:30] some take the two-handed sword and cut
[55:32] their way through Philistines and
[55:33] amorites till they take the whole thing
[55:35] he says that's what we should do every
[55:38] promise is to us footsteps is possession
[55:41] walk right up and take it God gave it to
[55:43] us it's a promise and it's the truth and
[55:46] it's for us Satan hates it when you
[55:49] cross over Jordan when he sees a death
[55:51] to self Satan gets scared because his
[55:54] power is in your selfishness it's in
[55:56] your Beast nature when you die to self
[55:58] when you cross over Jordan and you come
[56:00] into Canaan you come into the power of
[56:02] the Holy Spirit The Living Word eternal
[56:05] life then what is it Satan starts to
[56:07] worry because now he doesn't have an
[56:09] inroads on you his inroad to you is s
[56:13] but that's been sealed the Holy Ghost
[56:16] has sealed your soul now and so now he's
[56:18] only dwelling with the
[56:20] Flesh and he starts to tremble why cuz
[56:24] he's been camping out on the word of God
[56:26] he's been holding you back believing you
[56:28] won't make it and when you get the Holy
[56:30] Ghost you've crossed over now you're in
[56:32] the land of the Holy Ghost now you're in
[56:33] the land of the full word of God and he
[56:35] realizes that your aim is to kick him
[56:38] out that your aim is to take what he's
[56:40] been holding back from you for so long
[56:43] he knows his time is Short scripture
[56:46] talks about it there's a time where
[56:47] Satan realizes his T time is short and
[56:49] he comes down with great wrath he's
[56:51] desperate he's doing everything he can
[56:53] to hold you back cuz the the further you
[56:55] go the less time he's got what did Rahab
[56:58] say to the Spy she says we've heard and
[57:00] we're all scared let me tell you Satan
[57:03] is scared of you this
[57:05] morning remember the prophet of God said
[57:07] when the weakest Christian Falls to
[57:10] their knees all of heaven trembles when
[57:13] you fall and you hold the token of the
[57:14] holy spirit before you Satan knows he's
[57:17] in trouble Satan knows he's got a fight
[57:20] on his hands and he knows he's got to
[57:22] leave because you're holding your
[57:24] Birthright you're holding the title deed
[57:26] you're holding your inheritance before
[57:28] you and he has no right to be
[57:30] there what was it she said we've heard
[57:32] of all the things that you've done and
[57:34] they weren't even in the land yet listen
[57:36] God does things with us before we get
[57:38] the Holy
[57:39] Ghost people get healed people get
[57:41] delivered there's provision all of these
[57:43] things are available to us but that's
[57:45] just before you get it imagine what it's
[57:47] like after you get it because it's now
[57:49] with a greater purpose now it's with a
[57:51] greater intent because it's not General
[57:53] now but it's the word of of God coming
[57:55] to life inside of you and that's what
[57:57] Satan hates the most is when he sees the
[57:59] Living Word coming out of your
[58:01] life but you notice in the desert they
[58:03] had their ups and
[58:05] downs you know in the desert they
[58:07] lost they had people taken hostage they
[58:10] refused the land they refused the
[58:12] promise but once they crossed Jordan
[58:14] there was no going back and God promised
[58:17] victory victory victory victory victory
[58:21] it was all Victory amen as long as could
[58:25] stay within the boundaries God promised
[58:27] them Victory this is what he said
[58:31] when not
[58:33] if church if you're not going to fight
[58:35] the fight will come to
[58:37] you if you got the Holy Ghost every gun
[58:40] in hell is trained on you you may not
[58:41] pick a fight but the fight's going to
[58:43] come to you so not if but when thou
[58:46] goest out to battle against thine
[58:48] enemies and see is horses and chariots
[58:49] and the people more than thou be not
[58:52] afraid of them when you face sit
[58:54] situations that are way more than you
[58:56] think you can handle don't be scared you
[58:58] got this cuz you're in my land you're in
[59:02] my word you're in your inheritance
[59:03] you're in the place that I have led you
[59:06] he didn't lead you didn't lead yourself
[59:08] I led you through I made a way I
[59:11] supernaturally parted the waters I've
[59:13] established you in the land now go take
[59:15] it he says for the Lord thy God is with
[59:18] thee which brought thee up out of the
[59:19] land of Egypt scripture says remove not
[59:22] not the ancient landmarks Moses said WR
[59:24] a book of remembrance when you think
[59:26] that things are too tough for you to
[59:27] handle think back on what God's done for
[59:30] you remind yourself of the things that
[59:32] God has delivered you from remind you of
[59:34] the provision of God remind yourself of
[59:36] the healing of God remind yourself of
[59:38] the leadership think back on what he's

[1:00:24] anointed word it'll prepare you for the
[1:00:26] battles in your life and it'll give you
[1:00:28] victory in your life as well he says and
[1:00:30] shall say unto them here o Israel ye
[1:00:33] approach this day under battle against
[1:00:35] your enemies let not your hearts faint
[1:00:37] fear not and do not tremble neither be
[1:00:40] ye terified because of them for the Lord
[1:00:42] your God is he that goeth with you to
[1:00:45] fight for you against your enemies and
[1:00:47] to save you he's a warrior to them and
[1:00:49] he's a savior to you I like that
[1:00:51] combination he's a destroyer to them and
[1:00:54] he's a savior to us amen Satan is
[1:00:56] looking to do anything he can to keep
[1:00:59] you from coming to this place he wants
[1:01:01] you to think you're defeated you're not
[1:01:03] enough you don't have enough you don't
[1:01:05] have it in you you're not what you
[1:01:07] should
[1:01:09] be Satan wants you to think you are what
[1:01:11] you used to be and he never wants you to
[1:01:14] know what you are in Christ he never
[1:01:17] reminds you of the truth of your
[1:01:18] position in
[1:01:20] Christ listen you made it this far you
[1:01:23] made it this far
[1:01:25] what can hold you back look how far
[1:01:28] you've come look at the things you've
[1:01:31] made it through and then press on to the
[1:01:33] next Point amen the only way that Satan
[1:01:37] had to keep Victory out of them was to
[1:01:38] put sin in the
[1:01:40] camp now here's the thing willful
[1:01:44] sin CU remember what happened aen
[1:01:47] willfully sinned he went and he found
[1:01:49] the Babylonian garment and he found the
[1:01:51] the wedge of gold and the the bit of
[1:01:53] silver and he knowingly took that into
[1:01:56] his home and hid it that was willful sin
[1:02:01] listen we walk in a dirty world you get
[1:02:04] dirty when you walk around dirty things
[1:02:07] we just had communion that's why they
[1:02:08] had to wash their feet it was it was the
[1:02:10] fact that when you walk in a muddy place
[1:02:12] you get mud on you I don't care how
[1:02:14] careful you are you're going to get
[1:02:16] dirty and that's why we have the blood
[1:02:18] of Christ that's why we repent every
[1:02:20] night dirt gets on us the idea though is
[1:02:23] to wash it off every day to put it under
[1:02:26] the blood but he says when you invite it
[1:02:28] in Victory leaves you willfully sin
[1:02:32] Victory leaves the home and here's the
[1:02:34] thing you'll notice things you used to
[1:02:36] beat you can't beat anymore because you
[1:02:37] let sin in the
[1:02:39] house why you open the door for Satan to
[1:02:42] come in that's willful sin that's the
[1:02:45] only way he's got to beat you is to put
[1:02:47] sin between you and him you and God
[1:02:50] willful sin that you'll be in iniquity
[1:02:52] amen when you invite sin in into your
[1:02:54] life by Disobedience direct Disobedience
[1:02:57] Victory leaves and they went and they
[1:02:59] went up against Ai and they lost they
[1:03:01] just sent up a few men they said figured
[1:03:02] oh it's a small town what something I
[1:03:04] should be able to beat as a mature
[1:03:06] believer but with sin in the camp they
[1:03:08] got their they got
[1:03:10] whipped cuz they invited sin in amen but
[1:03:14] through it all God promised Victory he's
[1:03:16] given us a blood covering he's given us
[1:03:18] a robe of righteousness if we're quick
[1:03:20] to repent he's quick to forgive right
[1:03:23] there's nothing going to hold us back
[1:03:25] the blood is there we've got an advocate
[1:03:26] with the father if our heart condemns us
[1:03:28] we have an advocate we've got somebody
[1:03:30] that can make it right we got somebody
[1:03:31] that can take care of our conscience
[1:03:33] amen but he's made every provision for
[1:03:35] victory and it's through the power of
[1:03:37] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives you know
[1:03:39] I've noticed that when God deals with
[1:03:41] the Jews he's very specific in the
[1:03:43] timelines you look at it and they are
[1:03:46] Picture Perfect to the
[1:03:49] year for what God said he was going to
[1:03:51] work with them you know you got the 70
[1:03:54] week you got the 70 years of Daniel you
[1:03:55] got the 400 years for the children of
[1:03:57] Israel to be in bondage and all of these
[1:03:59] different things you have perfect
[1:04:00] timelines but let me show you when it
[1:04:02] came to can Canaan God only said one
[1:04:05] thing about the timeline little by
[1:04:08] little and he said and it won't be a
[1:04:10] year after all this time of working in a
[1:04:14] perfect timeline God says there is no
[1:04:16] timeline for this it'll just be little
[1:04:18] by little he says in Exodus 23 I will
[1:04:21] not drive them out from before thee in
[1:04:23] one year let the land become desolate
[1:04:26] and the Beast of the field multiply
[1:04:28] against thee by little and little I will
[1:04:30] drive them out from before thee until
[1:04:33] thou be increased and inherit the land
[1:04:35] in other words you got to grow to fill
[1:04:37] the land before I'll give you the land
[1:04:39] because otherwise what happens is we
[1:04:41] clear out everybody else and because you
[1:04:43] don't have enough people to fill the
[1:04:44] land other others will come in and
[1:04:46] they'll take it back from you we've got
[1:04:48] to grow into our
[1:04:50] inheritance you get the Holy Ghost that
[1:04:52] doesn't mean you stop growing it doesn't
[1:04:54] doesn't mean you stop maturing but it
[1:04:55] means you're maturing constantly that as
[1:04:58] the victories come you're filling up the
[1:04:59] space that it clears out and Bit by Bit
[1:05:02] by Bit day by day by day what's
[1:05:04] happening we gain strength we gain
[1:05:06] endurance we gain commitment we gain
[1:05:07] consistency all of these things you know
[1:05:10] the scripture talks about it Jesus talks
[1:05:12] about it he said when a when a demon
[1:05:14] Spirit leaves a person and it goes out
[1:05:16] for a while and then it comes back and
[1:05:19] it finds that life all cleaned
[1:05:21] up all cleaned up but no one res resent
[1:05:25] no one living there so it says hey this
[1:05:27] is a better place to live than before
[1:05:29] and it calls seven other demonic spirits
[1:05:31] and they Comm in it says the last state
[1:05:33] of that person is worse than they were
[1:05:34] in the beginning why cuz they didn't
[1:05:36] fill up the emptiness with something
[1:05:38] that would keep it out in the end that's
[1:05:40] the way our lives are as Satan a as
[1:05:42] Satan is cast out of our Lives we got to
[1:05:44] fill it with God when that door gets
[1:05:46] open and the Holy Ghost clears it out
[1:05:48] you got to fill the room you got to fill
[1:05:50] the room with the things of God as as
[1:05:53] things are taken out of our Liv lives we
[1:05:54] get more time you got to fill that with
[1:05:56] good things not with more things that
[1:05:58] Satan wants but you got to fill them
[1:06:00] with the good things of God you've got
[1:06:02] to put the word to action in your life
[1:06:04] to make sure that you're filling those
[1:06:05] rooms of your home that your land is
[1:06:07] taken care of so that things can't come
[1:06:09] in and make it worse than it were was
[1:06:11] before man as we go through these things
[1:06:14] there's going to be Trials of our faith
[1:06:15] you get the Holy Ghost it's the start of
[1:06:17] so many trials amen there'll be Trials
[1:06:19] of patience commitment there'll be
[1:06:21] Trials of our understanding and there to
[1:06:23] grow us and take is closer to God every
[1:06:26] single one is a purpose for a child of
[1:06:28] God every trial has a
[1:06:31] purpose in the world they they go
[1:06:33] through things and they learn nothing
[1:06:34] they get nothing from it so often but
[1:06:36] for a child of God it always has purpose
[1:06:39] and what is it it's to bring us closer
[1:06:41] to God always to bring us closer to God
[1:06:45] brother Braham said this he says it is
[1:06:47] written in one of the scriptures in the
[1:06:48] Bible that trials brought upon us are
[1:06:50] more precious to us than gold itself for
[1:06:53] it is God giving us these trials he says
[1:06:55] and we after we become his property our
[1:06:59] confession and our baptism and our
[1:07:01] promise to walk in life for him then
[1:07:03] every trial that comes upon us is to
[1:07:05] perfect us for his glory it's to bring
[1:07:08] us to a place where God can make himself
[1:07:12] more real to us than he was before the
[1:07:16] trial come how many want more of
[1:07:19] God get ready for
[1:07:21] trials how many want to know a greater
[1:07:24] Living God get ready for trials you
[1:07:26] don't have to raise your hands amen how
[1:07:29] many want to see God in a greater
[1:07:30] Supernatural element you got to get into
[1:07:33] situations that require more of a
[1:07:34] supernatural element you want to see
[1:07:36] greater power you got to get into a
[1:07:37] greater trial you want to see more of
[1:07:40] God you've got to come up against more
[1:07:41] of Satan don't
[1:07:43] you but it's for the purpose of
[1:07:45] glorifying God and drawing us closer I
[1:07:48] mean you if you've been with people you
[1:07:50] know I think of even my sister going
[1:07:52] through cancer and then miraculously
[1:07:55] healed but she said it does something to
[1:07:58] your
[1:07:59] life because when life hangs in the
[1:08:02] balance you seek God in a way you
[1:08:04] haven't before there's a desperation
[1:08:07] there's a sincerity there's a Holiness
[1:08:09] that comes across your life and what's
[1:08:12] it doing it's God bringing you closer to
[1:08:16] him that's all he wants us to do he's
[1:08:19] trying to produce the word in your life
[1:08:21] and that means everything else has to
[1:08:22] get pushed out and as good as we are as
[1:08:25] old as we are as long as we've been
[1:08:27] serving the lord in this good old way
[1:08:28] there's always things that need to be
[1:08:30] pushed out always it's a
[1:08:32] NeverEnding thing we're always having to
[1:08:36] grow amen so don't get upset with the
[1:08:38] trials if we understand the purpose
[1:08:41] embrace them and say Lord I'm going to
[1:08:43] come out of this closer to you than I
[1:08:45] was before and if that the trials are
[1:08:48] pushing us away then we've forgotten who
[1:08:50] we are and we've forgotten that we're a
[1:08:52] child of God and that God does these
[1:08:54] things for our
[1:08:56] good
[1:08:58] amen are you going through a trial
[1:09:01] today God's got a
[1:09:03] purpose God's got a
[1:09:06] purpose Isaiah said in chapter 54 and 17
[1:09:10] said no weapon that is formed against
[1:09:13] thee shall prosper no that's an absolute
[1:09:16] none zero zil nada
[1:09:19] nothing that comes against you can
[1:09:22] prosper that word Prosper means it
[1:09:23] cannot
[1:09:25] Advance huh can't even push you off your
[1:09:29] ground it cannot make progress and it
[1:09:32] cannot succeed doesn't mean they won't
[1:09:34] try there's many weapons formed against
[1:09:37] us there's many things are coming
[1:09:38] against us there's many things will come
[1:09:40] against us but he says not a single one
[1:09:42] of them is allowed to prosper against
[1:09:44] the
[1:09:45] believer he said this he says and every
[1:09:49] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[1:09:50] judgment Thou shalt condemn there will
[1:09:53] be no accusation that can hold and
[1:09:55] there's full victory in the believer's
[1:09:57] Life what a place and that's your place
[1:10:00] in Christ spotless sinless Perfect Bride
[1:10:04] he says this is the Heritage this is the
[1:10:06] inheritance this is the property of the
[1:10:09] Servants of the Lord and their
[1:10:11] righteousness is of me saith the Lord I
[1:10:14] want to remind us of a quote I read just
[1:10:16] a couple Services ago and we're speaking
[1:10:18] on the Holy Ghost and what it does for
[1:10:20] us and in us and the power it brings to
[1:10:21] our life and brother Braham said when
[1:10:23] perfect love has come into the human
[1:10:25] heart all demons in hell all will never
[1:10:30] be able to upset it everyone cannot do
[1:10:35] it that's an absolute no weapon that
[1:10:39] formed against the shall prosper no
[1:10:41] weapon no person no Creed no Doctrine no
[1:10:43] Ministry no experience no complex no
[1:10:46] problem nothing can knock you off of
[1:10:50] your position as a child of God church I
[1:10:53] want you to to find your Anchor Point
[1:10:54] this
[1:10:55] morning if you are a child of God and
[1:10:59] you have received the Holy Ghost you
[1:11:02] cannot
[1:11:03] fall you cannot fall we read it last
[1:11:06] service remember in second Peter 1 Peter
[1:11:08] says if you go through this entire thing
[1:11:10] all these attributes from Faith all the
[1:11:12] way to brotherly kindness and then you
[1:11:13] get charity which is the Holy Ghost he
[1:11:14] says if you do this you cannot fall it's
[1:11:19] impossible you can't do
[1:11:21] it you can't do it
[1:11:24] when he seals your soul that's it it's a
[1:11:28] finished work it's done you cannot lose
[1:11:31] your Eternal reward you cannot lose your
[1:11:34] position in Christ you cannot lose the
[1:11:36] restoration that he's bringing about in
[1:11:38] your life amen how is this possible
[1:11:41] because when God takes up residence in
[1:11:42] your soul it's him that keeps you up
[1:11:46] it's him that makes you stand it's him
[1:11:48] that makes you walk it's him that makes
[1:11:49] you overcome it's Christ in me that's
[1:11:51] doing it it's not me I can't fall
[1:11:53] because it's him that's living inside of
[1:11:55] me I died I'm dead I fell now he lives
[1:12:01] that's why I can't fall because it's
[1:12:03] Christ in me the hope of glory that's
[1:12:05] keeping me on this way that keeps me
[1:12:07] pressing towards the promises of God
[1:12:09] that keeps me looking for leadership
[1:12:11] that keeps me trusting in his word day
[1:12:12] by day it's Christ in me that's living
[1:12:15] not me he's the mighty conqueror he's
[1:12:17] the power he's the life he's the
[1:12:19] Fountain of everything that I have need
[1:12:21] of in my life but around would say this
[1:12:24] he says we know that you're here we know
[1:12:26] that you're the same yesterday today and
[1:12:28] forever we know that you cannot fail we
[1:12:31] know that you've triumphed over the
[1:12:33] devil over his power over every
[1:12:35] principality and power you bound every
[1:12:38] unclean Spirit you cast out every devil
[1:12:41] when you were here on
[1:12:42] Earth now let's take it to us in John 5
[1:12:46] it says verily verily I say unto you he
[1:12:48] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:12:50] him that sent me ha present tense right
[1:12:54] now right here today has everlasting
[1:12:57] life and shall not come into
[1:12:58] condemnation but his past already done
[1:13:01] it passed from Death unto life amen
[1:13:04] we've already been judged in Christ
[1:13:06] we've already been given eternal life
[1:13:07] and we stand now and we cannot fall
[1:13:09] because we're in
[1:13:11] him he said but as many as received him
[1:13:14] gave he the power to become The
[1:13:15] Offspring of God he said I give unto
[1:13:18] them eternal life eternal life comes
[1:13:20] from the Greek word of Zoey Zoey is that
[1:13:23] life Zoe is the life of God and the life
[1:13:26] of God living in you produces a Godly
[1:13:29] life just as certain as I'm standing in
[1:13:30] this platform and the man that's got it
[1:13:33] can no more perish than God can perish
[1:13:36] because God is in the
[1:13:40] man do you have the Holy Ghost this
[1:13:43] morning you can't
[1:13:46] perish because it's God in
[1:13:49] you church we tend to think in short
[1:13:51] terms we're human
[1:13:54] we tend to think of even to the the
[1:13:56] aspect of just our natural life well I
[1:13:57] was born I'm 44 years old today and it's
[1:14:00] all about the here and now but when you
[1:14:02] look at who you are you got to look big
[1:14:05] picture because you go all the way back
[1:14:08] to Eternity you go way back before time
[1:14:11] began when God had a thought of you and
[1:14:15] God has been working in this case for
[1:14:17] thousands and thousands of years to
[1:14:20] bring you to where you are today he had
[1:14:23] to set up Union after union relationship
[1:14:26] after relationship marriage after
[1:14:28] marriage immigration after immigration
[1:14:30] this after that to bring everything
[1:14:32] around to produce you right here
[1:14:35] today and it's a tangled web that nobody
[1:14:38] could ever
[1:14:39] unwave and it's the it's God himself
[1:14:41] that's been purposing and bringing you
[1:14:44] to this place today to where you can sit
[1:14:46] under the hearing of the word and accept
[1:14:49] it that you have been coming to a place
[1:14:52] where you can hear the truth and the
[1:14:53] truth can set you free that's the
[1:14:56] working of God and he thought it way
[1:14:58] back when and until and as soon as he
[1:15:01] thought it and he spoke it it's been
[1:15:03] working ever since to bring you to this
[1:15:05] place today where you are wherever
[1:15:07] you're at in life God has purposed it
[1:15:10] and God has worked it out amen and he's
[1:15:12] bringing you back into relationship
[1:15:14] that's his only thing is to bring you
[1:15:15] back to where you were in the beginning
[1:15:17] and nothing's going to stop him from
[1:15:18] doing
[1:15:20] that listen to this it says that's the
[1:15:22] same thing he does does when he gives
[1:15:23] you the Holy Ghost baptism with fire he
[1:15:26] can come and dwell with you and we can
[1:15:28] sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:15:30] because we are already in him not we
[1:15:35] will be we are now sitting in Christ
[1:15:38] Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy
[1:15:41] Ghost baptism by one Spirit we're all
[1:15:43] baptized into Christ which we are now we
[1:15:46] won't be in Christ he says we are he is
[1:15:50] the great spiritual King over the spirit
[1:15:51] that's in us because we were in him at
[1:15:54] the beginning I want you to see this
[1:15:56] next it he says see God in the beginning
[1:16:00] when he thought of you and thought of
[1:16:01] others like you thought of himself of
[1:16:05] being
[1:16:07] tangible that's why you're sitting here
[1:16:10] today is because God's thoughts became
[1:16:12] word and that word went forth and that
[1:16:15] word has to become tangible this whole
[1:16:18] series is on manifesting time what
[1:16:21] becoming tangible the word becoming
[1:16:24] tangible the promise of God becoming
[1:16:26] tangible God himself stepping into human
[1:16:29] flesh in Bride form and producing the
[1:16:31] word for this day he says God's thoughts
[1:16:34] were meant to be tangible you know what
[1:16:36] that tells me Church there's a tangible
[1:16:38] effect of being a Christian that it's
[1:16:40] not just hulum pokum and it's not just
[1:16:43] Theology and it's not just ideas and
[1:16:44] doctrines but it's a life it's an effect
[1:16:47] it's it's the very purpose of God coming
[1:16:49] through
[1:16:50] us it's not just sitting at home and
[1:16:53] reading our Bibles it's not just coming
[1:16:54] to church and warming a Pew and singing
[1:16:56] songs but it's the very life of God
[1:16:58] becoming real through you and I that's
[1:17:01] what he's looking for tangible word
[1:17:04] touchable word seeable word hearable
[1:17:07] word feelable word that's what he's
[1:17:09] looking
[1:17:10] for that's why he gives you the Holy
[1:17:12] Ghost so that the word can become
[1:17:15] tangible he says that was his thoughts
[1:17:18] see so he expressed his thoughts by word
[1:17:21] he said let there be Let There Be and
[1:17:24] there
[1:17:26] was and it's sitting in front of us
[1:17:29] today and the whole world misses it God
[1:17:32] revealed in Simplicity the thoughts of
[1:17:34] God are sitting in these pews today the
[1:17:37] expression of the thoughts of God are
[1:17:39] sitting in this pews today what do we
[1:17:41] call the word what do we call the
[1:17:42] thoughts of God Church the
[1:17:44] word the word is sitting in the pews
[1:17:47] today and it's by the power of the holy
[1:17:49] spirit that you can do it this morning
[1:17:51] that you can produce it
[1:17:53] he says his word cannot fail well I just
[1:17:56] told you you're the word the word made
[1:17:59] flesh so you cannot fail as long as the
[1:18:01] word has the
[1:18:02] preeminence put your name here I cannot
[1:18:06] fail as long as I'm with the word he
[1:18:09] said he's God and what a refuge that is
[1:18:11] what a consolation to know that we're
[1:18:14] not children just tossed about not
[1:18:15] knowing where we're going we know where
[1:18:17] we're going God promised it and he
[1:18:19] vindicates his promise church we know
[1:18:22] where we're going going we're in the
[1:18:24] last bid of the seventh Church age all
[1:18:27] that's left is a resurrection and a
[1:18:29] Rapture we're going in a Rapture by
[1:18:31] God's grace and if we go by way of the
[1:18:34] Grave we'll go in a resurrection and
[1:18:36] these body will be changed from Mortal
[1:18:38] to Immortal and in a moment in the
[1:18:40] twinkling of an eye will be changed and
[1:18:41] we be caught up to be with him that's
[1:18:44] what the power of the Holy Ghost is is
[1:18:46] the final expression is in that
[1:18:48] resurrection and in Rapture but in the
[1:18:50] meantime it's got a work here to do to
[1:18:52] produce the Victorious Life of the
[1:18:54] believer inside each and every one of us
[1:18:56] that's the purpose of God today amen the
[1:18:59] purpose of the Holy Ghost is to produce
[1:19:01] what God
[1:19:04] Said the word goes to the word the word
[1:19:07] produces the
[1:19:09] word that's what's happening here today
[1:19:11] the word is coming to the word and it'll
[1:19:13] knock down anything it needs to knock
[1:19:15] down it'll open any door it needs to
[1:19:16] open it'll go around anything it needs
[1:19:18] to go around it'll go under it'll do
[1:19:20] whatever it has to do to get where it's
[1:19:23] going to go to get where it's supposed
[1:19:25] to go to get you into that Resurrection
[1:19:27] Rapture he says he showed us he's
[1:19:29] speaking of Christ he showed us how it's
[1:19:30] done how did he do it by the word that's
[1:19:34] how he done it for he was the word and
[1:19:35] Jesus said if you abide in me and my
[1:19:37] words in you you're back to word again
[1:19:39] the Word of
[1:19:41] Promise that's what we are today the
[1:19:43] Word of
[1:19:45] Promise he says what is the Word of
[1:19:47] Promise to every Christian greater is he
[1:19:50] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:19:51] world he says then how do I overcome not
[1:19:54] me but the word that's in me I'm not
[1:19:56] trusting in this flesh this flesh is
[1:19:59] weak even as an experienced Christian
[1:20:01] this flesh is
[1:20:05] weak but greater is he that's in
[1:20:09] me than he that's in the world he says
[1:20:12] the word is God then I overcome the
[1:20:14] things of the world because it's the
[1:20:16] word in me if you abide in me in my
[1:20:17] words and you then just ask what you
[1:20:20] will so often we look at that as an
[1:20:22] external asking Lord I ask that you
[1:20:25] provide money Lord I ask that you
[1:20:27] provide for this or you do no no no ask
[1:20:29] for this
[1:20:31] first Lord this body this Spirit has
[1:20:34] needs and it needs to be the
[1:20:38] word like we said last service are our
[1:20:40] prayers about the natural or about the
[1:20:43] spiritual what is our
[1:20:46] focus is it to make a resurrection in a
[1:20:48] Rapture or is it to make our next bill
[1:20:51] payment he said says just keep pressing
[1:20:53] up you're coming up to the top as sure
[1:20:56] as anything see you've got to come to
[1:20:58] the top what is it the word is becoming
[1:21:00] flesh amongst us church if we know where
[1:21:03] we're going let's focus on getting there
[1:21:06] listen I'm I'm headed out to go moose
[1:21:08] hunting after this service is done you
[1:21:10] know what's going to happen as soon as
[1:21:11] this service is over I'm going to shake
[1:21:12] hands I'm going to run out the door I'm
[1:21:14] going to pack up the van and I'm going
[1:21:15] moose hunting why I know where I'm going
[1:21:19] I got a timeline to get there I got a
[1:21:21] purpose to get there and nothing is
[1:21:22] going to stop me by God's
[1:21:24] grace I'm focused on making it there
[1:21:27] before it gets too dark so I don't hit a
[1:21:28] moose on the way
[1:21:30] there right my only focus after the
[1:21:34] service make it to moose
[1:21:36] hunting but as a Believer what's our
[1:21:39] Focus make it to a resurrection and a
[1:21:43] Rapture and our mind needs to be set on
[1:21:46] the things of God on the purpose of God
[1:21:47] of the plan of God of of what God is
[1:21:50] trying to do in our lives rather than
[1:21:52] just the Munday of every
[1:21:55] day we've got to see deeper than that
[1:21:57] we've got to lay aside every fear every
[1:21:59] doubt every worry and say Lord lead me
[1:22:02] and I'll follow show me what's mine and
[1:22:05] you can only know what's yours by
[1:22:07] reading this by hearing this and Faith
[1:22:10] cometh by hearing and hearing comes by
[1:22:12] the word of God faith comes by
[1:22:13] understanding and understanding comes by
[1:22:15] the word you're not reading your Bible
[1:22:16] you're not hearing your Bible you're not
[1:22:18] coming to church whatever it might be
[1:22:19] you're going to miss out because there's
[1:22:21] an anointed place for you to hear these
[1:22:23] things it's to bring you into your word
[1:22:28] position like Mary said the word came to
[1:22:31] Mary and she didn't understand it all
[1:22:35] but she said be it unto me according to
[1:22:37] Thy
[1:22:38] word I can't explain all of this to you
[1:22:42] I can't explain how God works I can't
[1:22:45] explain why he holds or why he moves
[1:22:48] sometimes I can't explain the
[1:22:50] intricacies of of God's mind
[1:22:53] but all I can say is Lord I believe it
[1:22:56] Lord I believe you're doing it Lord I
[1:22:57] believe you've done it and Lord I
[1:22:59] believe I'm a part of it why because he
[1:23:01] came to
[1:23:02] me and he's come to you to tell you
[1:23:05] you're a member of the Bride of Jesus
[1:23:07] Christ this
[1:23:08] morning Paul said this what know ye not
[1:23:12] that your body is the Temple of the Holy
[1:23:14] Ghost which is in you which ye have of
[1:23:17] God and you are not your own church you
[1:23:19] know what it means there it means that
[1:23:21] I'm not my own it means I'm God's
[1:23:24] Property and when you belong to God that
[1:23:27] brings some real benefits with
[1:23:29] it amen it means we belong to him it
[1:23:33] means your life is under the authority
[1:23:34] of God that means it brings Victory it
[1:23:37] brings Holiness it brings peace it
[1:23:39] brings rest it brings love it brings
[1:23:43] contentment all of these things come
[1:23:46] when God has made the center of our
[1:23:48] Lives amen it brings Victory he says for
[1:23:52] ye are bought with a price what a price
[1:23:54] it was he says therefore glorify God in
[1:23:58] your body and in your spirit which are
[1:24:02] God's you notice he doesn't say the
[1:24:04] soul cuz here the soul is already
[1:24:07] sealed that work's already done he says
[1:24:11] you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost the
[1:24:12] Holy Ghost is already dwelling inside
[1:24:13] you so he says now glorify God in your
[1:24:16] body and your spirit remember last
[1:24:18] service we drew the three rings and in
[1:24:19] the inside is the soul and then the next
[1:24:21] is the spirit then the next is the body
[1:24:23] he says now that you've got God on the
[1:24:24] inside of the inside let God out let God
[1:24:27] into the rest of your life let him into
[1:24:29] your mind let him into your memory and
[1:24:31] your conscience and Imagination let them
[1:24:32] go in your five senses let faith of the
[1:24:35] word come forth and produce God in the
[1:24:37] rest of it let the Holy Ghost clean out
[1:24:40] the rest of it so that the rest of it
[1:24:41] can glorify God we don't have to sit
[1:24:44] here and say this flesh this flesh this
[1:24:47] flesh it's weak we know it but through
[1:24:51] the Holy Ghost we can make it of no
[1:24:54] effect if we let the Holy Ghost
[1:24:56] loose it'll make this flesh even glorify
[1:24:59] God it'll make our mind glorify God
[1:25:03] it'll Cast Away vain imaginations it'll
[1:25:05] Cast Away complexes it'll do things in
[1:25:07] our life that were not previously
[1:25:09] possible why because the holy spirit is
[1:25:11] being let loose in your life to glorify
[1:25:15] God that spirit in our body is our is
[1:25:18] our humanity and he's saying let God be
[1:25:21] glorified even in your Humanity you know
[1:25:23] what it does church it's a promise that
[1:25:26] takes away our
[1:25:29] excuse
[1:25:31] right you got the holy ghost that means
[1:25:34] everything in your life can be made
[1:25:36] subject to the power of the word
[1:25:39] everything you know I think about this
[1:25:42] has happened to me a number of times I'm
[1:25:44] sure men will understand our
[1:25:47] children if you've had your wife or
[1:25:50] children if you've had your mom ask you
[1:25:52] to clean something
[1:25:53] up and you go and clean it to the best
[1:25:57] of your
[1:25:58] ability and then when Mama or wife comes
[1:26:01] in what does she
[1:26:03] do starts
[1:26:05] cleaning why because she's got a
[1:26:08] standard that's higher than your
[1:26:11] standard she's got a vision of what that
[1:26:13] room should look like or could look like
[1:26:16] and it's different than yours she has a
[1:26:19] required
[1:26:21] cleanliness that's greater than yours
[1:26:24] and so as good as your job was before
[1:26:26] when Mama comes in the room the standard
[1:26:30] changes and she starts putting this here
[1:26:32] and that there and oh you missed this on
[1:26:34] the carpet no let's let's run a vacuum
[1:26:36] over this again pretty soon she does all
[1:26:37] the work that you did before I remember
[1:26:39] recently she asked me to clean up the
[1:26:41] the bathroom and I went and I wiped
[1:26:42] everything down she went in and wiped
[1:26:43] everything down all over
[1:26:45] again why she's got a higher
[1:26:49] standard and as clean as our lives are
[1:26:53] under sanctification under justification
[1:26:56] when the Holy Ghost comes in the
[1:26:57] standard goes
[1:26:59] up standard goes up why he's in the
[1:27:04] house and God's standard is higher than
[1:27:06] our standard and things that used to be
[1:27:09] okay they're not okay
[1:27:12] anymore God starts to clean up the house
[1:27:14] amen he's very particular about how his
[1:27:17] house looks because the house is now a
[1:27:19] reflection of him not a reflection of
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:23] his name is over the house His Banner
[1:27:25] Over Me Is Love right Jehovah nii our
[1:27:29] Banner we sang about it this morning his
[1:27:32] name's over the property now this is no
[1:27:34] longer the home of Jonathan klette this
[1:27:36] is now the home of Jesus Christ and he
[1:27:38] has a word standard for every aspect of
[1:27:41] the property church he doesn't just come
[1:27:43] in and clean the
[1:27:44] house he starts to work on the whole
[1:27:47] property because remember the house is
[1:27:49] the soul but then you got to thing
[1:27:51] around that
[1:27:53] and that's the close-up lands and then
[1:27:55] you got beyond that the body and that's
[1:27:56] the far sprung reaches of your entire
[1:27:58] life he says and every bit of it has to
[1:28:01] come to a place where it can glorify
[1:28:03] God you know you you look around when I
[1:28:06] was in BC things rot there I think
[1:28:08] faster than anywhere else in the world
[1:28:09] they get so much rain and it's such a
[1:28:11] temperate climate so anything that's
[1:28:12] wooden rots and you'll drive by these
[1:28:14] beautiful properties and the house is
[1:28:16] perfect but everything on the fringes is
[1:28:19] broken down the fences have rotted and
[1:28:22] they've fallen down and if somebody
[1:28:23] wanted to come in they could easily get
[1:28:25] in if animals wanted to get in or out
[1:28:27] they could but when God comes in he
[1:28:28] starts working on every element of our
[1:28:31] life those fences that were broken down
[1:28:33] he starts to build them up the gates
[1:28:35] that don't work he starts to repair
[1:28:37] right he starts to clean up the property
[1:28:39] starts to take out the dead stuff he
[1:28:41] starts to clean it up so it looks nice
[1:28:44] so it
[1:28:45] functions right he's turning it into a
[1:28:48] working property now instead of a
[1:28:49] shambled
[1:28:51] property
[1:28:52] why because it's his property
[1:28:55] now so he sets up a security
[1:28:59] system and he sets up guardian angels
[1:29:02] and he puts out patrols and he builds
[1:29:05] the fences up again and there's
[1:29:07] controlled access now through a gate and
[1:29:10] the only one that can open that gate
[1:29:11] aside from him is you so when bad stuff
[1:29:14] comes in it's because we let it in
[1:29:17] because he's cleaned it up he's made the
[1:29:20] he's made everything around it secure
[1:29:22] and the only one that lets it in is us
[1:29:24] it's the only way Satan can get in
[1:29:26] because he's in the house now and he
[1:29:28] builds everything up around it to keep
[1:29:30] everything
[1:29:32] back and everything that was in it that
[1:29:35] was bad he moves it out how many of you
[1:29:38] have driven around in we don't see it
[1:29:40] maybe so much in New Finland you see it
[1:29:42] more out west and you drive by a farm or
[1:29:43] something they got 18 rused cars out in
[1:29:45] the field
[1:29:47] somewhere old
[1:29:49] complexes old family issues
[1:29:52] old
[1:29:53] scars things you used to
[1:29:56] do God doesn't let those stick around
[1:30:00] Holy Ghost cleans them out moves them
[1:30:02] out because it's an eyes sore it's not
[1:30:04] befitting for the
[1:30:07] king all of these things he what is he
[1:30:09] doing he's cleaning it out because they
[1:30:11] don't glorify God
[1:30:12] anymore and you know what you got to let
[1:30:15] it
[1:30:17] go we deal with a lot of
[1:30:20] complexes I got to let it go the power's
[1:30:23] there to move it the equipment's there
[1:30:25] to haul it out I got to let it
[1:30:29] go sometimes we have Nostalgia for the
[1:30:32] old things let it
[1:30:34] go we hold on to hurts because it
[1:30:36] solidifies us in our
[1:30:38] bitterness no no we got to let it
[1:30:43] go the difference between simple
[1:30:45] sanctification which is the work of the
[1:30:47] Holy Spirit and the indwelling of the
[1:30:49] holy spirit is that the holy spirit is
[1:30:51] establishes full dominion over every
[1:30:54] aspect of your
[1:30:56] life it's there to raise the standard of
[1:30:58] the word to make us live to make us
[1:31:00] breathe the very word of God in every
[1:31:03] aspect of our life it's there to set us
[1:31:04] free from every attribute of sin brother
[1:31:07] B would say this many times he says you
[1:31:09] know if if an animal latches on to me he
[1:31:11] says I don't need to cut off the leg he
[1:31:13] says I just need to cut off the
[1:31:15] head he says go for the head don't go
[1:31:17] for the limb he says you'll get a much
[1:31:19] more immediate response if you chop off
[1:31:21] the head
[1:31:22] he says and that's what Christ did at
[1:31:23] Calvary is he chopped the head off of
[1:31:25] sin and every attribute every claw every
[1:31:29] tooth every bit of it that can harm you
[1:31:31] was killed at Calvary and so the only
[1:31:33] thing that holds you back is if you let
[1:31:34] it
[1:31:35] in cuz it's dead it's dead if Christ is
[1:31:39] in your life listen to what he says he
[1:31:41] says Satan the ruler of the earth he
[1:31:45] owns it he says it belonged to him but
[1:31:48] now Christ has redeemed it one time I
[1:31:50] was his property but not
[1:31:53] now one time that little woman was his
[1:31:55] property but not now he's talking about
[1:31:58] that scripture we read in Luke he says
[1:32:00] see he come to loose the grip of it he
[1:32:02] loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my
[1:32:04] life upon your life and now we're not
[1:32:07] his he says have you often heard me say
[1:32:09] in prayer take your hand off of God's
[1:32:11] Property see amen have faith to claim
[1:32:14] your
[1:32:15] own have faith to claim your
[1:32:20] own
[1:32:22] what's a part of your
[1:32:24] property it's not just
[1:32:26] you you've got
[1:32:29] family that belongs to
[1:32:31] you he says have faith to claim your own
[1:32:34] that's your
[1:32:36] rights that's your
[1:32:40] rights all that loved you and all you
[1:32:43] ever loved will be over there claim your
[1:32:47] rights he says that's your rights take
[1:32:50] your hands off of her take your hands
[1:32:52] off of him see faith will do it Oh my he
[1:32:54] says not annihilate it but just take
[1:32:56] your hands off of it to loose it to let
[1:32:59] it go to pass it away what's he saying
[1:33:01] he's saying we don't have strength or or
[1:33:04] power to destroy demons but we have
[1:33:06] faith to cast them off we have power to
[1:33:09] cast them off because destruction isn't
[1:33:10] until the final judgment our place is
[1:33:12] not to judge our place is to Proclaim
[1:33:14] Liberty by the Holy Ghost he says the
[1:33:18] Earth will change he says it changes the
[1:33:20] Earth will change politics Will Change
[1:33:22] the religions will change the
[1:33:23] denominations will pass away politics
[1:33:25] will pass away and the kingdom of God
[1:33:27] shall be established he said and when I
[1:33:30] see the token I'll pass over you the
[1:33:32] Holy Ghost is our token he said it's a
[1:33:35] sign it's a sign that the price has been
[1:33:37] paid that Jesus Paid the price and you
[1:33:39] received it from him holding the token
[1:33:41] in your hand you have an assurance of
[1:33:44] Resurrection for the believer today we
[1:33:46] have an assurance of rapture he says you
[1:33:48] have the assurance that everything you
[1:33:50] have need of in this journey is provided
[1:33:53] in that token of his suffering at
[1:33:55] Calvary where he met the price of Every
[1:33:57] curse that could be put on
[1:34:00] you church if the price has been paid
[1:34:04] what is the
[1:34:06] cost the cost to me and you is
[1:34:10] nothing remember brother Braham talked
[1:34:12] about he said you know it's like you go
[1:34:14] into a candy store he says and if they
[1:34:17] tell you that the store belongs to you
[1:34:20] he says I just want to go in in there
[1:34:21] and start looking and trying and tasting
[1:34:25] everything that belongs to
[1:34:30] me the price is
[1:34:33] free it's a sure thing Victory is given
[1:34:36] the promises are given we're not talking
[1:34:38] the the silliness of prosperity Doctrine
[1:34:40] and whatnot we're talking about word
[1:34:43] promises he says that token speaks
[1:34:48] peace amen he says there is no devil can
[1:34:51] stand before before it there's nothing
[1:34:53] can stand before it because God has
[1:34:55] accepted it he says and you hold the
[1:34:58] token in your hand that the price is
[1:34:59] paid he says oh it's a positive token we
[1:35:04] won't get into it today but we're going
[1:35:05] to move into the next service on the
[1:35:06] thought of the Holy Spirit as the
[1:35:08] enforcer because that's what he is he's
[1:35:10] an enforcer but he's an enforcer that
[1:35:13] works by Allah law and the law is the
[1:35:15] word of God Amen we'll look at the
[1:35:17] intention the purpose of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:19] of the indwelling of God in our lives
[1:35:23] what I'm trying to get at this morning
[1:35:24] is we don't have to live in a defeated
[1:35:26] State we don't have to live in a
[1:35:28] tormented
[1:35:29] State we don't have to live in a
[1:35:31] discontented state we don't have to live
[1:35:34] in complexes and fears and
[1:35:38] worries why because you are the Temple
[1:35:41] of the Holy
[1:35:43] Ghost you know Satan loves
[1:35:47] shame have you ever noticed Jesus
[1:35:50] constantly went to to women that were in
[1:35:52] shame to people that were in shame the
[1:35:56] first great casting out of devils was
[1:35:58] Mary Magdalene you remember and she had
[1:36:00] seven demons and he cast them out of her
[1:36:03] that was a woman that was in
[1:36:04] shame then he comes to a woman at the
[1:36:08] well and she's had five husbands and
[1:36:11] she's living common law in a time where
[1:36:14] a woman wasn't supposed to do that after
[1:36:16] she married the first time that's still
[1:36:18] the same standard today by the
[1:36:20] way but she was six times she was five
[1:36:24] times over the limit for marriages and
[1:36:26] relationships living common law in that
[1:36:28] day that that that just wasn't something
[1:36:31] you did and yet she was living common
[1:36:33] law and Christ comes to a woman living
[1:36:34] in shame a woman that has to come to the
[1:36:37] well in the middle of the day CU she
[1:36:38] can't come with the good people with the
[1:36:41] real
[1:36:43] Christians and Satan had her bound and
[1:36:46] Jesus said I have need to go by way of
[1:36:49] Samaria cuz there's a a woman in shame
[1:36:53] that'll believe
[1:36:57] me when the Holy Ghost comes in that
[1:37:00] door opens wide Maria Bethany lazarus's
[1:37:04] sister she was the woman that was caught
[1:37:07] in adultery she was the one that came
[1:37:10] and anointed his
[1:37:11] feet not the woman caught in adultery
[1:37:13] but she was a woman of of lowest
[1:37:16] State shameful after shameful person set
[1:37:20] free by the very presence of the word
[1:37:23] made
[1:37:23] flesh and Satan loves to hold us back in
[1:37:26] shame when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:37:29] there's no room for it anymore there's
[1:37:31] no room because the Holy Ghost is there
[1:37:33] to give life and
[1:37:35] Liberty to open the doors and the only
[1:37:38] one that'll keep it Clos is you and I
[1:37:41] but he's there to bring light he's there
[1:37:43] to bring joy he's there to bring peace
[1:37:44] he's there to bring rest he's there to
[1:37:46] bring Deliverance he's there to bring
[1:37:47] Victory if we'll let him do it the only
[1:37:50] thing holding the holy goes back in our
[1:37:51] lives is us the only thing can stop it
[1:37:54] in my life is
[1:37:56] me because it's still free moral agency
[1:37:59] there's still a choice
[1:38:02] there listen to this as we start to
[1:38:04] close brother Braham said the strength
[1:38:07] of the Holy Ghost lays in God's
[1:38:11] promise if you can tie back to the word
[1:38:15] of
[1:38:16] God then you can have assurance that the
[1:38:18] Holy Ghost will do the work in your life
[1:38:21] but what happens today is we try and
[1:38:23] rest the word we try and control it we
[1:38:25] try and manipulate it to do things but
[1:38:29] if you can find it in the place it's
[1:38:30] supposed to be if you can place it the
[1:38:32] way it's meant to be then the Holy Ghost
[1:38:34] can go into action in your
[1:38:37] life we're going to pick up in the next
[1:38:39] service but I want to say this that you
[1:38:40] can you don't have to stay in the
[1:38:42] condition you're in any condition you're
[1:38:46] in that would hinder your walk with God
[1:38:49] you don't have to stay in it
[1:38:52] you don't have to stay
[1:38:53] there because why he's here to restore
[1:38:57] you back to full
[1:39:00] relationship I'm not saying there's not
[1:39:02] a fight clearly there's a fight clearly
[1:39:05] there's a struggle clearly there's a
[1:39:06] battle but I'm saying that Victory is
[1:39:08] assured we have the victory because we
[1:39:11] have the mighty conqueror inside of us
[1:39:13] amen he's there to break every chain
[1:39:14] he's there to cast out every doubt he's
[1:39:16] there to heal every sickness brother
[1:39:18] said to take care of every attribute of
[1:39:20] sin when he killed the head he took care
[1:39:22] of everything beneath it everything that
[1:39:24] Satan brings against us can be met by
[1:39:27] the power of God undefeated
[1:39:30] amen as the musicians come he said when
[1:39:33] God gives you the Holy Ghost it's
[1:39:36] settled Church you know what that tells
[1:39:38] me the greatest thing you got to settle
[1:39:41] in your mind is do I have the Holy
[1:39:43] Ghost that's the only thing that matters
[1:39:45] in this life is do I have the Holy
[1:39:48] Ghost he says you know where you stand
[1:39:52] you know what happened and you're sealed
[1:39:54] all the way till the day of your
[1:39:56] Redemption he says your destination of
[1:39:58] this Earthly Journey oh my that ought to
[1:40:00] make anybody just have faith and believe
[1:40:03] God and just rise up in the power of the
[1:40:07] holy spirit amen God bless you let's
[1:40:10] stand this
[1:40:11] morning what's he saying he's saying
[1:40:14] when God gave you the Holy Ghost he gave
[1:40:16] you victory over everything that stands
[1:40:19] in your path a resurrection and a
[1:40:21] Rapture
[1:40:23] everything everything there's a reason
[1:40:25] why brother bham could stand there and
[1:40:27] say I take every Spirit under control in
[1:40:30] this room why because the holy spirit
[1:40:33] said it not a man cuz the holy spirit
[1:40:35] said I'm here to Proclaim Liberty I'm
[1:40:38] here to open prison doors I'm here to
[1:40:41] heal diseases I'm here to change lives
[1:40:43] I'm here to give you a new mind I'm here
[1:40:45] to take away your complexes I'm here to
[1:40:48] give you Victory I'm here to give you
[1:40:49] faith I'm here to give you courage
[1:40:52] to take away the
[1:40:54] trembling you know sometimes we get so
[1:40:56] psyched up in our minds about what's
[1:40:58] what's coming our way or what we're in
[1:41:00] that it just binds us and we can't move
[1:41:02] we're immobile you know there's a
[1:41:05] there's a there's snakes that what they
[1:41:06] do is they they they they catch the eye
[1:41:08] of that animal and it hypnotizes them so
[1:41:10] that they can't move and they just get
[1:41:13] closer and closer and closer and then
[1:41:14] they grab it and that's the way Satan is
[1:41:15] he gets us so focused on him that we
[1:41:18] can't get our eyes on God and it
[1:41:20] paralyzes our faith but the Holy Ghost
[1:41:23] here
[1:41:23] to knock us out snap us say what are you
[1:41:28] looking at look to me look at the word
[1:41:33] what are you dwelling on don't dwell on
[1:41:35] that that's not going to help you that's

[1:41:40] eyes on my word put on some music start
