[41:59] mercies and Grace and comfort will be
[42:01] with him Lord those that have lost a
[42:04] loved one Lord we're praying your
[42:05] Special Touch for them through the
[42:06] coming days and weeks Lord Lord but
[42:09] we're asking you to be in our midst once
[42:11] again this evening Lord God in the not
[42:13] as just in the worship and praise Lord
[42:15] but in the preaching and hearing of the
[42:17] word also Lord God may you discern the
[42:19] thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord
[42:21] may you just set us on a right path may
[42:23] you draw us closer to you Lord help us
[42:25] to just willingly set aside everything
[42:27] that comes against us Lord that would
[42:29] Lord come between you and us Lord draw
[42:32] us closer to you we pray now in Jesus
[42:34] Christ's name we ask it amen amen God
[42:37] bless you turn if you would to John
[42:39] chapter 1 and then we'll go to John
[42:41] chapter 8 right after
[42:43] that and John chapter 1 Welcome each one
[42:47] amen welcome sister Rebecca ebear I
[42:49] believe it is amen God bless you good to
[42:51] have you with us amen also wanted to say
[42:55] that uh we got got the the moose meat
[42:57] from the church moose and we put as much
[42:59] of it as we could in the freezer out
[43:01] there so you can go and just take
[43:03] whatever you need to as you need it and
[43:05] and don't worry about it there's there's
[43:07] plenty there and we've got more at our
[43:08] place as well um as needed there so go
[43:11] ahead and take that definitely want to
[43:13] remember brother Ivan Brenton and the
[43:16] loss of his wife I had talked to him
[43:17] earlier today before she passed just to
[43:19] let him know we'd be there to support
[43:20] them in the funeral service and a number
[43:22] of us has committed to going out there
[43:24] to help with song leading and
[43:26] ministering and music and these
[43:27] different things but we'll see how that
[43:29] works out as they as he sorts out the uh
[43:32] the funeral arrangements but just want
[43:34] to remember him as you can imagine
[43:36] husband for 54 years and love of his
[43:39] life is gone no children with her or
[43:41] anything so it's an empty house very
[43:43] empty house and she hasn't been there
[43:45] for quite some time but you know he's
[43:47] been spending 12 hours a day in the
[43:48] hospital with her and just kind of comes
[43:51] to a sudden crashing halt so we want to
[43:53] remember him in prayer he's very broken
[43:54] up about it and he needs our support he
[43:57] needs our help and I've told him we'll
[43:58] do anything we can with that amen amen
[44:01] turning the word now if we would I'm
[44:03] getting a bit of an echo here amen John
[44:07] chap 1 verse4 we read this in the last
[44:09] service and we'll read it again this is
[44:11] speaking of the word Christ the word it
[44:13] says in him was life and the life was
[44:15] the light of men and then if we'll turn
[44:18] to John 8 and verse
[44:21] 12 John 8 and: 12 it says then spake
[44:25] Jesus unto them again unto them saying I
[44:27] am the light of the world he that
[44:29] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[44:32] but shall have the light of life amen
[44:34] God bless you you can have your seats
[44:35] this evening anden just trusting his
[44:38] goodness and we're going to continue on
[44:39] our series on manifesting time and I'm
[44:41] taking a second service on the subtitle
[44:43] of the spirit of light and we spoke last
[44:46] service and really we were focused on
[44:47] letting the Holy Spirit into every
[44:49] aspect of our life and not having doors
[44:51] closed and not having areas off bounds
[44:53] you know brother Bron would talk about
[44:54] do you do you invite some into your
[44:56] house and then you say well you can't go
[44:57] upstairs and you can't go here and you
[44:59] can't go there he said if he's the Lord
[45:01] of your life see savior's easy savior's
[45:04] easy because that's what he does for you
[45:06] amen and you can walk away and that's a
[45:07] free gift given but when he becomes Lord
[45:10] now he's got access now he's supposed to
[45:11] have you know you're supposed to make
[45:13] everything available to him amen and
[45:15] we're supposed to let the word of God
[45:16] take effect and whether it's in
[45:18] preaching whether it's in the reading or
[45:20] hearing of the word whatever it might be
[45:22] God has ordained the word to be active
[45:24] amen that we're not just sitting here
[45:25] and just nodding our heads and saying
[45:27] amen but amen amen means so be it and
[45:29] when I say Amen it means so be it in my
[45:31] life and when you say Amen that means
[45:33] you're saying Lord so let it be in my
[45:34] life that it's not just agreeing that
[45:36] it's right but it's agreeing that it's
[45:38] right for me and I want my life to match
[45:40] up with what the word says amen and that
[45:42] takes real humility that takes sincerity
[45:44] that takes us saying you know like like
[45:46] brother bam talked about that color
[45:47] woman she says you know I'm not where I
[45:49] want to be and I'm not what I ought to
[45:51] be but thank God I'm not what I used to
[45:52] be either and as far as forward as some
[45:55] some of us are and you know you look at
[45:57] the elders and whatnot in the church you
[45:58] say well how much further can you go we
[46:00] can all go further amen we've all got
[46:02] further to go we've all got a an ability
[46:05] to go closer to God Amen and we've got
[46:06] to be able to say Lord I'm willing to do
[46:08] whatever it takes to get me there Lord
[46:10] whatever he asked me to lay down
[46:11] whatever you ask me to pick up I'll do
[46:13] it if it means I can get closer to you
[46:15] but I want to spend a bit of time this
[46:17] evening and we won't be long Lord
[46:19] willing tonight but I want to look at
[46:21] what this looks like practically because
[46:22] we've been talking about walking in the
[46:24] light and you say well brother John what
[46:26] does that mean to walk in the light what
[46:28] does it look like on a day-to-day basis
[46:29] how do I walk in the light how do I get
[46:31] closer to God how do I spend my time in
[46:33] the presence of God and I want to focus
[46:36] on the idea that we're meant to show
[46:37] forth the Praises of God every day of
[46:40] our life we're supposed to be reflecting
[46:41] God where we're supposed to be
[46:43] reflecting his life in us and he's
[46:44] brought us out of darkness and he's
[46:46] brought us into light and that means
[46:47] there ought to be a way we used to be
[46:49] and there ought to be a way we are and
[46:50] there ought to be a difference between
[46:52] the two amen there ought to be a big
[46:53] Gulf a big separation between what I
[46:55] used to be and what I am today even if I
[46:57] was raised in this message I've said it
[47:00] before when I was raised in this message
[47:02] I I believed it to be true in general
[47:04] but boy I had I had problems with people
[47:07] and I had problems with Ministries I had
[47:08] problems with this and that and the
[47:10] other thing and thoughts and opinions
[47:11] and when I truly gave my heart to the
[47:13] Lord and when I got the Holy Ghost those
[47:14] thoughts changed my Doctrine changed my
[47:18] understanding changed my Revelation
[47:20] changed and all of a sudden why because
[47:22] now he's working on me and it's not
[47:23] subject to the filter of my mind but now
[47:25] submitted myself to the Holy Spirit I've
[47:27] made him Lord of my life and he starts
[47:29] to take a hold of these things amen we
[47:32] get a change when we repent absolutely
[47:34] we do we get a change when we're
[47:35] baptized we get a change when we're
[47:37] Sanctified but the change is constantly
[47:39] going on in our life because the word is
[47:41] alive amen and is supposed to be active
[47:43] in our life every day amen when we can
[47:45] go through repentance baptism
[47:47] sanctification and never be a
[47:49] Christian remember Christian means
[47:51] Christlike now if I ask for a show of
[47:54] hands I'm not going to but how many
[47:55] would say today I'm Christlike that's a
[47:57] high standard that's a high standard to
[48:00] say I'm Christlike and here's the thing
[48:01] in this flesh will never be a perfect
[48:03] reflection but let's focus on where we
[48:05] are reflecting and where we're not say
[48:07] Lord make us a reflection of you amen
[48:09] but in this flesh dwells no good thing
[48:11] as we've talked about before but we've
[48:13] got to live it like we believe it amen
[48:15] and our life shows how we really believe
[48:17] it if we really believe it then we'll
[48:18] live different but if it's just
[48:19] something in our mind something in our
[48:21] mouth it's not going to do anything but
[48:23] if we truly believe it in our heart it's
[48:24] going to change Our Lives amen now I
[48:27] read this quotee and I want to start I I
[48:29] I read it last service because I want us
[48:31] to find a real foundation for our
[48:32] Christian walk in this series that's
[48:34] what I'm really getting at here I want
[48:35] it for me and I want it for you and I'm
[48:37] not saying you don't have it if you do
[48:39] have it let's confirm it and if you
[48:40] don't have it let's get you on the right
[48:41] foundation and man let's get us to where
[48:43] we need to be because I'm seeking a
[48:45] greater reality every day I want a
[48:47] greater reality of Christ in my life I
[48:49] want to see more of him and I want to
[48:50] see less of me that's what a reality is
[48:53] more of him less of me amen and if if I
[48:55] can see that then everything else that
[48:57] we look for every other promise we look
[48:59] for every sign every wonder it follows
[49:01] there but it the more that I can get me
[49:03] out of the picture and more of him into
[49:05] the picture the more I'm going to see
[49:06] Christ the word reflected in my life
[49:08] amen so I'm not preaching to you today
[49:10] I'm preaching to me and you happen to be
[49:12] the beneficiaries of it I think Amen
[49:15] brother Braham said this he says you
[49:16] might go through life living a good
[49:18] Christian Life you might belong to some
[49:20] church you might have a fine membership
[49:23] you might be a moral character and all
[49:25] of that but brother that still isn't
[49:27] Christianity Christianity is when the
[49:29] Holy Ghost has taken full
[49:32] possession full possession of you and
[49:36] you're led by the holy spirit so in
[49:38] other words the Difference Maker for us
[49:40] is not our morality amen it's not our
[49:43] knowledge it's not even what we call our
[49:46] our Revelation it's not the church we
[49:48] attend it's not the ministry we sit
[49:49] under that is not the Difference Maker
[49:52] the Difference Maker is when the Holy
[49:54] Ghost is inside of me that's what makes
[49:56] all the difference in all of this amen
[49:58] it's the difference makers when the Holy
[49:59] Spirit has the preeminence in you and me
[50:02] and that brings us into adoption that's
[50:04] what brings us to where we're going in
[50:05] this service amen and if we're ever
[50:07] going to be used of God we've got to
[50:08] find us in a place where we've let go
[50:11] and he's got the preeminence where he's
[50:12] the one that's making the decisions in
[50:14] our life amen we've got to come to the
[50:16] place where we die so completely that
[50:18] our Everly inclination is to get away
[50:20] from ourselves and find out what his
[50:22] word says about what we're going through
[50:23] in life that ought to be what we're
[50:25] looking for amen now I don't know about
[50:26] you but that's a challenge for me
[50:29] because so easily what happens is is if
[50:31] we're we're doing well and we get up in
[50:33] the morning and we have our devotions
[50:35] and we have our prayer time and we're
[50:36] all set guess what Satan coming to me
[50:38] right after that usually doesn't get
[50:40] anywhere but give me a couple hours
[50:42] anden give me a little bit of time to
[50:44] get worked up about something or get
[50:45] tired or get cranky or have something
[50:47] not go the way I thought it should go
[50:50] let somebody drop some bad news on me
[50:52] and now we've got a real Challenge on
[50:53] our hands to say what is it that God God
[50:55] would have me do in the situation
[50:57] because I've stepped away from the
[50:59] presence that was there that morning we
[51:01] want to find a time and a place where we
[51:03] can be in his presence all day long
[51:06] where we have ready access to it where
[51:08] we understand that we have access to the
[51:10] throne room that we have access to the
[51:11] shikina presence of God and in doing so
[51:14] we can access him for any situation
[51:16] we've got in our life amen I love how
[51:18] brother Bram talks about David he says
[51:20] when David came to Goliath he didn't
[51:22] have to get prayed up he didn't have to
[51:24] go down and have devotions he didn't
[51:26] have to make anything right he was ready
[51:28] to go when the when the giant came
[51:30] across his path he was ready for
[51:32] whatever came across his path that day
[51:34] amen so we've got to realize this isn't
[51:37] a battle that's flesh and blood when
[51:39] when when people don't agree with us
[51:41] when when things don't go our way when
[51:43] sickness comes our way or differences or
[51:45] or when there's a lack in our life
[51:46] somehow this is not a flesh and blood
[51:48] matter amen it's a spiritual battle
[51:51] that's what we're wrestling against it's
[51:52] a supernatural conflict that we're
[51:54] dealing with every day and that means we
[51:56] need a supernatural atmosphere and we
[51:58] need a supernatural mindset to go
[52:00] through life and be an overcomer in this
[52:02] age amen so the winners and the losers
[52:04] are not based on intelligence knowledge
[52:07] influence money understanding it's
[52:10] influenced by who's in line with the
[52:11] word and who's out of line with the word
[52:14] because the word can never fail and if
[52:16] you're in line with the word then that's
[52:17] all that matters amen so that means
[52:19] we've got to stay close to the word
[52:20] we've got to be checking in with God not
[52:22] just daily but throughout the day amen
[52:26] it's a it's a good thing to stop and
[52:28] take a break from things that we're
[52:30] doing and just sit back and and and and
[52:32] maybe even it's as simple as just pray
[52:34] about a need in the church think about
[52:36] somebody other than yourself once in a
[52:38] while and I'm not saying that as a as a
[52:40] as a put down I'm saying put a bit of
[52:43] time into those around you bring a need
[52:46] before the Lord maybe it's yours maybe
[52:47] it's somebody else but break up your
[52:49] schedule a bit to give God a little bit
[52:51] of time and remind yourself let yourself
[52:53] know I'm a Child of God
[52:55] and whatever I'm doing I'm a Child of
[52:58] God when I'm doing it and I need to be
[53:00] found walking in that in a day-by-day
[53:01] place Amen Brother John Andy shared this
[53:04] with me and I thought it was a great
[53:06] quote he says and we should not be just
[53:10] gatting about from place to place now we
[53:13] don't know what gatting about means I
[53:14] had to look it up I I guessed what it
[53:16] meant but here's what it means it means
[53:18] to go around from one place to another
[53:21] in the pursuit of pleasure or
[53:24] entertainment so we're not out looking
[53:26] for a good time all the time he says we
[53:29] should always go and consider the Lord
[53:32] before we go do you do that when you
[53:34] leave home pray Lord help me to have a
[53:37] safe journey over where I'm going and
[53:39] back ordering my steps today that I'll
[53:41] not step out of your blessed path how
[53:45] many want to live in the will of God I
[53:47] want to live in the will of God but
[53:49] watch what he says but if I should make
[53:52] the wrong move we're going to make the
[53:55] wrong move sometimes church but if I
[53:57] should make the wrong move maybe we
[53:59] should put it this way when I make the
[54:01] wrong
[54:02] move Lord you'll warn me and bring me
[54:06] back into the right way again amen it's
[54:08] easy to get hauled out it's easy to get
[54:11] diverted just a little bit off the path
[54:13] he says but if you'll warn me and bring
[54:15] me back into the right way again if my
[54:17] tongue should start to speak things that
[54:19] was not right will you just stop my
[54:21] tongue from
[54:22] speaking you know so often we want the
[54:24] other person to shut up how about Lord
[54:27] shut me up Lord help me to be quiet Lord
[54:30] still my tongue who can who can control
[54:33] the tongue the scripture says it's a
[54:36] mighty thing it's a small thing but it's
[54:37] a mighty
[54:39] thing he says bring me back into the
[54:42] right place again we can't control the
[54:44] other person we can't control the
[54:46] situation all we can control is oursel
[54:48] Lord bring me back to where I need to be
[54:51] and if I should start thinking wrong
[54:53] thoughts will you just change my way of
[54:55] thinking and let me think the right
[54:59] things this is in the message hear ye
[55:02] him brother B talks a lot about
[55:05] adoption this is what takes you to
[55:09] adoption he says what you think is
[55:12] usually what you do that means you got
[55:14] to get your thoughts right and if you
[55:16] can get your thoughts right then usually
[55:18] what follows will be the right thing
[55:20] that's the greatest battle ever fought
[55:22] brother Braham said was for the minds of
[55:23] men what are you going to think and will
[55:26] you take on the mind of Christ which is
[55:28] subject to the word or will you leave
[55:30] the the the the mindset of your own
[55:32] Humanity in there to give yourself all
[55:33] the reasons to be as worked up as you
[55:35] are or as down as you are as the case
[55:37] may be he says you know if you'll do
[55:39] right that's your duty to God God
[55:41] expects us to do the right thing but he
[55:43] says if you'll think right that's your
[55:45] duty to yourself CU you can control that
[55:48] you can decide how you're going to spend
[55:49] your time what goes on up there remember
[55:52] he said you can't stop a bird from
[55:55] flying over your head but you can stop
[55:56] it from building a nest and Satan's
[55:58] going to drop thoughts in your head all
[55:59] day long he's going to try and put ideas
[56:01] there he's going to try and put you know
[56:03] we call it discernment but a lot of
[56:05] times it's just bias personal preference
[56:07] or opinion and he'll try and put that in
[56:10] and what you'll have is the holy spirit
[56:11] sitting there saying but the word of God
[56:13] says if you'll say what does the word
[56:16] say because otherwise Satan will work
[56:18] your ear off over
[56:19] here he says if you'll think right
[56:21] that's your duty to yourself and you got
[56:23] to come out right you can't be going
[56:25] east when you're going west east when
[56:27] you're going west you can't be going
[56:29] wrong when you're going right or vice
[56:31] versa he says think right do right
[56:33] you'll be right amen he says Jesus our
[56:37] lord as he walked here on Earth he did
[56:40] not just go about from place to place
[56:41] with great entertainment and the
[56:43] Applause of men and the applauding of
[56:45] the audiences and of the great flowery
[56:47] things that the men of this world or the
[56:49] teachers would Praise Him by but every
[56:51] footstep that he made was ordered by the
[56:53] Lord he says oh I just love that when he
[56:56] said even at 12 years old young people
[56:59] listen up even as a young person he said
[57:02] know ye not that I must be about my
[57:05] father's business how that brings us
[57:07] then to shame when we're so all the time
[57:09] gading about and the Bible said that the
[57:11] footsteps of the righteous is ordered of
[57:14] the Lord now catch this he says we
[57:16] should walk in his ordination for us
[57:21] walk like a Christian talk like a
[57:23] Christian live like a
[57:25] Christian so we're going to talk about
[57:27] this a bit more when we get into more on
[57:29] the adoption side of things but I want
[57:31] to say this brothers and sisters you
[57:32] don't just go to work every day that's a
[57:35] worldly thought Lord I'm going to go
[57:38] into work help me to make a good living
[57:40] today that's the way the world
[57:41] approaches it what you've got to say is
[57:44] Lord help me to be a light for you in
[57:46] the place that you've given me to make a
[57:48] living because you're the only light
[57:50] that this world has you're the only word
[57:52] you're the only Bible that most people
[57:54] ever going to see or read and we are the
[57:56] ones that they've got to see and If all
[57:58] we're doing is going in and coming out
[58:00] without the mindset that the sons of God
[58:03] are led by the spirit of God then we
[58:05] forget that we're doing something of
[58:06] Eternal purpose everywhere we go whether
[58:09] it's in a grocery store whether it's at
[58:12] your job whether it's in home school the
[58:14] people we run into every one of them is
[58:17] looking at us and we're supposed to be a
[58:18] witness in a testimony we're supposed to
[58:20] be showing forth the glory of God Amen
[58:23] so we don't just go to work
[58:25] work we ought to be saying every time we
[58:27] leave the door Lord help me to have an
[58:29] eternal impact on somebody's life today
[58:32] help people to see Christ in me help
[58:35] them to look past me help me to stay in
[58:37] your presence so that they have
[58:39] access help me to keep my mind right
[58:42] help me to keep my tongue in check help
[58:44] me to keep my attitude right so that
[58:46] somebody else has an opportunity at the
[58:48] eternal life that I so freely enjoy on a
[58:50] daily basis amen we're all ministers in
[58:52] that regard we're serving those that are
[58:55] around us by keeping the right attitude
[58:57] and the right spirit and expressing the
[58:58] word of this day through our lives amen
[59:01] I referenced this scripture earlier just
[59:03] a moment ago and and Peter said this he
[59:05] says but ye are a chosen generation
[59:08] you're here now today CU God chose you
[59:10] to be here today that means he's meant
[59:13] for you to express something that nobody
[59:15] else could express except you in the
[59:18] place you're in the relationships you're
[59:19] in the sphere of influence you have
[59:21] whatever it might be he's made you to be
[59:24] doing what you're doing today each one
[59:27] as individuals he says you're a royal
[59:30] priesthood a holy nation A peculiar
[59:33] people why that you should show forth
[59:35] the Praises of him who had called you
[59:37] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[59:40] that's why I said there has to be a
[59:42] difference you can't walk in darkness
[59:44] and walk in light the same way you ever
[59:47] have to get up in the middle of the
[59:48] night and you thump
[59:49] yourself I've gotten to the place where
[59:52] I can do just about anything in the dark
[59:53] in my room but but I've been in that
[59:55] room so many times in the dark but if
[59:57] you're trying to get around in the dark
[59:59] you're going to bump you're going to be
[1:00:01] one of those things that goes bump in
[1:00:02] the night usually with a muttering after
[1:00:05] that right there's a difference how you
[1:00:08] walk when there's lots of light I could
[1:00:10] run as fast as I wanted in here turn out
[1:00:11] the lights and I don't think I'd do so
[1:00:13] well right we'd hear a really big Echo
[1:00:16] as I hit that and that and that and that
[1:00:18] what we walk different when we come into
[1:00:20] these things amen but if we'd have that
[1:00:22] mindset that we're walking out the door
[1:00:25] or we're going to the shed quarters or
[1:00:26] we're going down to the
[1:00:28] basement every interaction we have is
[1:00:30] supposed to show forth the Praises of
[1:00:33] the glory of the one that's called us
[1:00:34] out of darkness and into light that
[1:00:37] would change my mindset if I was
[1:00:38] thinking that every single morning Lord
[1:00:40] let me show your glory today to somebody
[1:00:43] somehow if all my failures with all my
[1:00:46] faults with all my flaws Lord let
[1:00:48] somebody see you and me today that it
[1:00:50] changeed the way we approach things I
[1:00:51] believe amen that we'd be a better
[1:00:53] witness like I said sons of God are led
[1:00:56] by the spirit of God and that means if
[1:00:57] you are living right and you're making
[1:01:00] word decisions then you're led by the
[1:01:02] spirit of God you'll do it and that
[1:01:04] means that wherever you're at today
[1:01:06] whatever you're doing he's got a purpose
[1:01:08] for you to be there and it's not just to
[1:01:10] make a living it's not just to be
[1:01:11] comfortable but it's to show Christ to a
[1:01:14] Dying World that needs it
[1:01:16] amen listen if we can if we can live
[1:01:19] right if we can we can live by the word
[1:01:21] if we can be led by God we can see
[1:01:22] Eternal consequences out of everything
[1:01:24] we do every day it builds up and the
[1:01:27] smallest things can turn into the
[1:01:28] greatest decisions for people so many
[1:01:30] times brother B he's talking in the
[1:01:33] message Divine love and Sovereign Grace
[1:01:34] and he's talking about Israel at the Red
[1:01:36] Sea he says this because remember
[1:01:39] children of God are led by the spirit of
[1:01:40] God the pillar of fire LED them to the
[1:01:43] Red Sea and it looked like that was the
[1:01:46] end of all things he said no matter what
[1:01:48] comes or goes God orders
[1:01:51] it are you a child of God this evening
[1:01:55] then if you have stayed with the word
[1:01:57] then whatever God has ordered in your
[1:01:58] life it's by him it's not by you it's by
[1:02:02] him he says maybe through trials and it
[1:02:05] may be through troubles and tribulations
[1:02:07] but as long as God's leading what
[1:02:09] difference does it make he said now tell
[1:02:12] them to stand still they love me and
[1:02:14] they're projecting to me by proving that
[1:02:16] they believe me to step out on my word
[1:02:18] and they believe it and now they're at
[1:02:20] the end of the road love has taken them
[1:02:23] as far as it can so now I will project
[1:02:25] to them they projected love to me I'll
[1:02:29] project my divine grace and power to
[1:02:31] them and said tell them that they're at
[1:02:33] the end they can't do no more can't swim
[1:02:38] away can't run away you can't climb away
[1:02:42] you got mountains on both sides you got
[1:02:44] an army behind you and you got an
[1:02:45] unswimmable ocean in front of you you
[1:02:48] can't do a thing he says but they still
[1:02:50] love me and they believe me so my grace
[1:02:54] will work work now in this case he says
[1:02:56] it'll work tonight in your case it'll
[1:02:59] work in every case watch him then what
[1:03:02] took place God caused an East Wind to
[1:03:04] come down Moses didn't do a thing but
[1:03:06] walk right down to the seashore or the
[1:03:08] side of the Red Sea and just wave His
[1:03:10] Hands Across that's the way he says what
[1:03:12] Moses did just wave your
[1:03:15] hands that's it what was there something
[1:03:19] magical in the moving of Moses hands no
[1:03:22] he just did what God told him to do
[1:03:25] why you crying to me Moses why cry speak
[1:03:28] and go forth tell the people to get
[1:03:31] ready to go forth he says the sea went
[1:03:33] back what happened the pillar of fire
[1:03:35] was giving them light and leading them
[1:03:37] turned around and stood between them and
[1:03:39] the danger and to them it was Darkness
[1:03:41] to Israel it was light all night long he
[1:03:45] said I'm so glad that there's blessed
[1:03:47] Holy Light when the world's walking in
[1:03:49] darkness the Christian walks in the
[1:03:51] beautiful light of the Holy Spirit amen
[1:03:54] we're preaching on the spirit of light
[1:03:56] today and I want you to see how to walk
[1:03:58] in this light as we spoke about last
[1:03:59] service we we read the scripture that
[1:04:01] said if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:04:03] the light then we have Fellowship one
[1:04:04] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ cleanses us from all of our sins
[1:04:09] so you say brother John how do I walk in
[1:04:10] the light I'll tell you this it's not
[1:04:13] complicated but it's a
[1:04:15] challenge I find that's often the times
[1:04:18] with the way it works with the gospel
[1:04:19] it's not it's not that it's not
[1:04:22] understood it's that we don't pick up
[1:04:24] the challenge it's not difficult it's
[1:04:27] not complicated it's not hard to
[1:04:28] understand but we let ourselves down we
[1:04:31] don't step into it the way that we ought
[1:04:32] to remember the scripture says the life
[1:04:34] of light life of God is the light of man
[1:04:37] so this all starts with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:39] without the Holy Ghost you can't have
[1:04:40] the spirit of light without the Holy
[1:04:41] Ghost you can't walk in light you can't
[1:04:43] do it you've got to have him there with
[1:04:45] you amen and there's a working of the
[1:04:47] Holy Spirit we'll talk a bit about this
[1:04:49] afternoon and we've talked about that in
[1:04:50] the the seven attributes from Faith all
[1:04:52] the way through brotherly kindness and
[1:04:54] that brings light into our lives but
[1:04:57] that's not what makes us a Christian
[1:04:59] what makes us a Christian is when he's
[1:05:00] in our lives not just when the light's
[1:05:03] shining on us because that just makes us
[1:05:04] bright but when the light is in us that
[1:05:06] makes us a light house that makes us a
[1:05:09] light it doesn't give us light it makes
[1:05:10] us a light remember what Jesus said in
[1:05:12] Matthew he said ye are the light of the
[1:05:14] world we read the scripture where he
[1:05:16] says I'm the light of the world now he
[1:05:17] says ye are the light of the world a
[1:05:19] city that is set on a hill cannot be hid
[1:05:21] and neither do men light a candle and
[1:05:23] put it under a bushel but on a
[1:05:25] Candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[1:05:27] that are in the House Church that means
[1:05:30] that you can hide all you want at work
[1:05:32] remember the story about that guy that
[1:05:34] came back from being off in in some camp
[1:05:36] for for a whole summer and and he when
[1:05:38] he came back he says boy I did good they
[1:05:40] didn't know I was a Christian the whole
[1:05:41] time I was there that ought to be a
[1:05:43] shame if nobody knows we're a Christian
[1:05:46] anden he says you're going to be set up
[1:05:47] he says you don't put a candle under a
[1:05:49] bushel you don't put it under a Bas
[1:05:51] basket but you put it on a Candlestick
[1:05:52] so it will give light amen God's put us
[1:05:55] where we are to give light amen we are
[1:05:58] light we are a lighthouse because the
[1:06:00] Holy Spirit dwells inside of us he says
[1:06:02] NE he says but let your light so shine
[1:06:05] before men that they may see your good
[1:06:08] works not just good words good works he
[1:06:12] says and glorify your father which is in
[1:06:14] heaven so being in light doesn't make
[1:06:17] you a light that just makes you lit up
[1:06:19] you have to have light inside of you in
[1:06:21] order to become a light Amen to become a
[1:06:23] lighthouse of if we want to put it that
[1:06:25] way amen you've got to have it attached
[1:06:26] to you you got to have it inside of you
[1:06:28] so that when you move the light goes
[1:06:29] with you amen so if you're walking in
[1:06:32] light it's because the light is with you
[1:06:34] amen it's it's attached to you it's not
[1:06:36] just enough to be in an atmosphere you
[1:06:38] can be in an atmosphere and never have
[1:06:40] the Holy Ghost don't run away from the
[1:06:42] atmosphere but the atmosphere is not
[1:06:44] what saves you the Holy Ghost in you is
[1:06:46] what saves you amen that's what we're
[1:06:48] looking for amen we've got to have God
[1:06:50] With Us not in us not just with us now
[1:06:53] the prophet would preach on this idea of
[1:06:56] coming into the presence of God and
[1:06:57] being in the light of God in the message
[1:06:59] why are people so tossed about and and I
[1:07:02] think it's a key title because so often
[1:07:04] we're struggling and it seems like we
[1:07:06] can't keep our heads above water seems
[1:07:07] like we can't maintain momentum we get
[1:07:09] distracted we get pulled aside and we
[1:07:11] say what's going on brother B would say
[1:07:14] you've either let the anchor go or you
[1:07:15] never had one in the first
[1:07:17] place and sometimes we have to admit
[1:07:21] maybe we aren't so anchored in that part
[1:07:22] of our life sometimes we got to realize
[1:07:25] I don't have the Holy Ghost or if I had
[1:07:27] it I've stepped away from it we can walk
[1:07:31] away from that we can push him away we
[1:07:34] don't lose our Salvation just CU you're
[1:07:36] tossed about doesn't mean you're not a
[1:07:37] child of God just means you're out of
[1:07:39] position that's all that's happening
[1:07:41] amen but brother Brandon would approach
[1:07:43] it and he's talking about coming into
[1:07:45] the the shika Glory the the glory of God
[1:07:48] and he look at it from a tabernacle
[1:07:49] standpoint and if you look at a a view
[1:07:52] of the Tabernacle and this is the
[1:07:53] Tabernacle of the Wilderness this is the
[1:07:55] Tabernacle of Moses in the Old Testament
[1:07:58] and he he would look at this and he'd
[1:07:59] say there's light in every aspect of
[1:08:01] this Tabernacle and you see here you
[1:08:03] have the outer Court which is all on the
[1:08:05] outside and then you have an actual
[1:08:07] building and inside you have the inner
[1:08:08] court and then you have the holy of
[1:08:11] holies but each one of those has a
[1:08:13] measure of light and he'd say that's the
[1:08:15] way the Christian is is as you go
[1:08:17] further and further with God you're in
[1:08:19] light but the light changes as you go
[1:08:21] through it but he said there's only one
[1:08:23] light that's always on there's only one
[1:08:26] light that never fails there's only one
[1:08:28] light you can trust every single day of
[1:08:29] your life and that's in the holy of
[1:08:31] holies but he start on the outer coat
[1:08:33] and he says now there's three courts the
[1:08:35] Justified man out here in the outer
[1:08:37] Court he walks by daylight some days he
[1:08:40] has gloomy days some days are gloomy
[1:08:42] some days you wonder whether it's really
[1:08:44] worthwhile to serve God or not he says
[1:08:46] you're walking in the outer courts sure
[1:08:48] you're eating Mana sure you're a
[1:08:50] Believer sure you have eternal life sure
[1:08:52] if you die you go to heaven truly he
[1:08:54] says but what kind of a life are you
[1:08:57] living he's not tearing down your
[1:08:59] Christianity he's saying where are you
[1:09:01] at in your Christianity he says every
[1:09:04] day oh get out of here and oh I got my
[1:09:05] dander up today I told them about it I
[1:09:07] cussed them out I couldn't help it God
[1:09:09] forgive
[1:09:11] me ever been
[1:09:13] there he say sure he will certainly he
[1:09:16] will you're his child remember where you
[1:09:20] are is not a reflection of who you are
[1:09:22] unless you stay there
[1:09:25] right remember the scripture says a
[1:09:29] righteous man falls seven times but he
[1:09:31] keeps getting up he falls seven times
[1:09:34] and he gets up seven times guess what he
[1:09:36] gets up dirty he gets up tired he gets
[1:09:38] up worn out he gets fed up with himself
[1:09:41] but he keeps getting up where he is is
[1:09:43] not a reflection of who he is unless he
[1:09:45] stays down there he says but what kind
[1:09:47] of a life are you living my don't you
[1:09:50] hate to live that kind of a life the ups
[1:09:51] and downs there are trouble and a poll
[1:09:54] day and night backslid and back to
[1:09:56] church backslid and back to church this
[1:09:58] that and apologize for this over here he
[1:10:00] says this other fellow's just blooming
[1:10:02] right along and not a thing see he's
[1:10:04] drawing a contrast you're in the outer
[1:10:06] courts this man's someplace else he says
[1:10:09] what kind of a light is he walking in
[1:10:10] the one that's in and out is the one
[1:10:12] he's talking about he says it's
[1:10:13] according to the weather it give the
[1:10:15] light outside the gloomy the foggy the
[1:10:18] halfway then a bright day then a gloomy
[1:10:20] and a foggy and a cloud over the sun
[1:10:22] what's he saying he's saying light
[1:10:23] circumstances are determining whether
[1:10:25] you're a child of God on those days or
[1:10:28] how much of a child of God you are on
[1:10:29] those days one day you're in church to
[1:10:31] next you're backsliding one day you're
[1:10:32] cussing out and the next day you're nice
[1:10:34] and and and right is
[1:10:36] rain it's an external thing that's
[1:10:39] controlling you amen you haven't changed
[1:10:41] but you've let your environment change
[1:10:42] your attitude your approach your
[1:10:44] thoughts all of these different things
[1:10:46] and you come out of it and you're not
[1:10:47] looking so good brother says that's the
[1:10:50] way the regenerated Justified man lives
[1:10:52] that's right that's all all the light he
[1:10:54] has to walk in when he's just walking by
[1:10:56] that you say I come to Christ I join the
[1:10:59] church I put my name on the book I'm
[1:11:01] trying to live the best I can that's
[1:11:03] that's that's the person in the outer
[1:11:04] Court I'm doing the best I
[1:11:07] can why because it's only him that's
[1:11:09] doing
[1:11:11] it nothing wrong with it but it's not
[1:11:14] the highest level of light you can live
[1:11:16] in don't stop trying your best church
[1:11:20] just realize that your best is never
[1:11:22] going to be enough
[1:11:24] don't stop trying but don't rest in your
[1:11:26] trying you rest in the perfect sacrifice
[1:11:29] of
[1:11:30] Calvary he says well bless your heart
[1:11:32] brother I appreciate that God
[1:11:34] appreciates that if you believe he that
[1:11:36] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:11:38] that sent me has everlasting life you're
[1:11:40] my brother I love you but oh my my ups
[1:11:43] and downs oh my I'm the most miserable
[1:11:45] person I have to fight every day oh yes
[1:11:48] brother that's where you're walking
[1:11:49] that's all right then you say well I
[1:11:52] want to go a little deeper deeper church
[1:11:54] if we want to go deeper that means
[1:11:56] there's deeper we can go if we want more
[1:11:58] of God that means there's more of God to
[1:12:00] be have if we want to get closer to God
[1:12:02] that means there's a closeness that we
[1:12:03] can have to God Amen we don't have to
[1:12:06] live in a in a life where we're tossed
[1:12:08] about on a daily basis doesn't mean the
[1:12:10] storms won't come but their effect won't
[1:12:12] be the same as you walk into a greater
[1:12:14] light as you get closer to God Amen am
[1:12:17] man if we can we can just stop being
[1:12:19] tossed around and there's realize
[1:12:21] there's a place where in the body that
[1:12:22] Christ has made just for you where you
[1:12:24] can be solid you don't have to get
[1:12:26] knocked about and you can just rest in
[1:12:28] him
[1:12:29] amen I want you to notice though as we
[1:12:32] go through these
[1:12:34] courts that the further you go the
[1:12:36] smaller the court
[1:12:38] gets why is
[1:12:40] that CU only certain people were allowed
[1:12:43] to go in certain places the outer Court
[1:12:45] just about anybody could be there not
[1:12:47] everyone just about everyone but as soon
[1:12:51] as you go into the inner Court well
[1:12:53] that's only for the priesthood any
[1:12:55] priest could go in there but then you
[1:12:57] get into the holy holies and that's only
[1:12:59] needs room for one man once a
[1:13:01] year but you'll see in our life cuz
[1:13:04] remember when Christ died and he split
[1:13:05] the veil access is open for all and so
[1:13:09] the difference is not who is called it's
[1:13:11] who's willing if I can put it that way
[1:13:14] we're called you've got to be called
[1:13:16] we're a royal priesthood we're told to
[1:13:18] go into every aspect of this but this is
[1:13:20] truly whosoever will but you've got to
[1:13:22] go as far as you want to go because the
[1:13:24] thing you'll realize is the further you
[1:13:26] go the less your excuses hold up the
[1:13:28] further you go the it drops
[1:13:31] away because you can't say I didn't know
[1:13:34] or and he wasn't there to help me no the
[1:13:37] closer you get to him the more the
[1:13:39] excuses drop away because now it's got
[1:13:41] to be him that's doing it not you and so
[1:13:43] you can't say well I can't do it of
[1:13:45] course you can't do it none of us can do
[1:13:47] it but I've come in closer to him and
[1:13:49] now he's doing it in me and then when
[1:13:51] you get into the beginning into the very
[1:13:52] end it's him in me it's not just him
[1:13:54] doing it but it's him in me it's not
[1:13:56] just him working on me but it's him
[1:13:57] working in me now it's him that's
[1:13:59] actually doing these things in our lives
[1:14:02] amen but you can't go any further than
[1:14:04] you want to go amen the road Narrows the
[1:14:07] walls close in why cuz you're
[1:14:08] transitioning out of yourself and into
[1:14:10] Christ brother Brown would talk about
[1:14:12] that caterpillar remember he says and he
[1:14:14] goes through different
[1:14:15] stages and can you imagine knowing
[1:14:18] you're meant to be a butterfly and
[1:14:19] saying I choose to be a a caterpillar a
[1:14:22] miserable little worm the rest of your
[1:14:24] life right funky hair spots and
[1:14:28] everything and you could be a beautiful
[1:14:29] butterfly not Earthbound able to go
[1:14:32] anywhere you want anytime you want what
[1:14:34] a miserable thing it would be Amen
[1:14:38] brother brah says this but when he comes
[1:14:40] into the inner court now what's in there
[1:14:43] he says there's seven golden
[1:14:44] candlesticks by the holy place and it's
[1:14:46] giving light candlesticks are giving
[1:14:48] light that's to the man who quits his
[1:14:50] drinking quits his smoking quits lying
[1:14:52] quits stealing treats his neighbor right
[1:14:54] he's good to his wife or her good to her
[1:14:56] husband the same way man or woman the
[1:14:58] believer he has come to a place where he
[1:15:00] has quit all of his meanness which is
[1:15:02] through the blood with sanctification he
[1:15:05] says he's called to a new life and he
[1:15:07] walks in there he don't have to walk by
[1:15:09] that light out there he's got a better
[1:15:14] light not the best light he's got a
[1:15:16] better light he says he's walking by the
[1:15:18] light of seven golden candlesticks which
[1:15:20] is burning olive oil and the olive oil
[1:15:23] was representing the holy spirit so we
[1:15:25] look in here and we have the inner court
[1:15:27] and then we have the holy of holies
[1:15:29] Beyond it so you see there's a curtain
[1:15:30] in the front this is a cutaway view as
[1:15:32] you can see and in there now you got the
[1:15:34] seven golden candlesticks and he says
[1:15:37] now you've come to a place where there's
[1:15:39] light all the
[1:15:40] time there's no gloomy days there's no
[1:15:43] sunny days but there's light all the
[1:15:46] time there's always light
[1:15:48] there but he said the fire now was the
[1:15:52] baptism which baptized IES you even
[1:15:53] baptized out in there with the Holy
[1:15:55] Spirit but you're not hid away yet this
[1:15:57] is the sanctifying work of the holy
[1:15:59] spirit this isn't the new birth this is
[1:16:01] the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:03] he says you're not hid away yet you're
[1:16:05] not behind the veil here he is he says
[1:16:08] he's walking in these seven golden
[1:16:10] candlesticks there's much light in there
[1:16:13] but there's days he says when them
[1:16:15] lights gets dull there's days when them
[1:16:17] lamps smoke and the light is not so good
[1:16:19] there's times when them lights have to
[1:16:21] be relit again and you have to borrow
[1:16:23] from the neighbor to Light One Candle to
[1:16:25] the other it's still not a good light
[1:16:27] we're thankful for it but it's not the
[1:16:29] right light he says this is what this
[1:16:32] place looks like he says you say brother
[1:16:33] I've spoken in tongues I've shouted good
[1:16:36] wonderful but let me tell you something
[1:16:37] different all right he's walking in this
[1:16:39] light but it's an artificial
[1:16:42] light now he says what's in there it's
[1:16:45] olive oil which represents the Holy
[1:16:47] Spirit what's artificial about the Holy
[1:16:49] Spirit nothing you know what's
[1:16:50] artificial the fire that lights it and
[1:16:52] the people that light it we're the
[1:16:55] artificial part because the light that's
[1:16:57] in there is dependent on us maintaining
[1:17:00] it there's not an unending supply of
[1:17:02] olive oil in those candlesticks it has
[1:17:04] to be topped up on a daily basis hourly
[1:17:06] basis perhaps I don't know how fast it
[1:17:08] went through but the the the rule was
[1:17:10] you couldn't let the light out but it
[1:17:12] was dependent on us not falling asleep
[1:17:14] not forgetting keeping things topped up
[1:17:17] keeping them clean keeping them trimmed
[1:17:19] it was all on us as humans as priests to
[1:17:22] keep the light going
[1:17:23] that's what makes it artificial is it's
[1:17:25] on us and it can go out if we don't do
[1:17:28] our part he says it's not the light of
[1:17:30] the Sun the light of the moon or the
[1:17:31] Stars the man in the Justified courts
[1:17:34] when Night comes he has a very dim light
[1:17:36] just maybe the stars and maybe a Pale
[1:17:37] Moon a lot of flying clouds he's in an
[1:17:39] awful fix but the man up here at the
[1:17:42] altar notice you've got an altar in
[1:17:45] there he says who keeps himself under
[1:17:47] Consecration and says Lord I'm going to
[1:17:49] live right by you I'm the Deacon in the
[1:17:51] church or something or another I'm going
[1:17:53] to live good to my neighbor I'm going to
[1:17:54] try my best to do better Lord while he's
[1:17:57] living in a better light his lights
[1:17:59] seldom go
[1:18:01] out but they still go out he says but
[1:18:04] they do smoke up and they have to light
[1:18:07] one from the other see the Candlestick
[1:18:09] is the humanity part and they're made of
[1:18:12] gold and it's supposed to represent
[1:18:13] deity but here they're representing us
[1:18:15] and the Holy Spirit needs brings the
[1:18:17] light but we need the cleaning cuz we
[1:18:19] get blocked up we need the trimming we
[1:18:22] get dried out the problem's not the oil
[1:18:24] the problem is the candlesticks amen
[1:18:27] that's us in there brother randam will
[1:18:29] point us back to Zechariah 4 1-6 and and
[1:18:32] the angel would would talk to Zachariah
[1:18:34] about this and he'd say here is another
[1:18:36] lamp of pure gold of course the oil
[1:18:38] typifies the Holy Ghost who alone can
[1:18:41] give the light of God to the people the
[1:18:43] angel who spoke to Zachariah was as much
[1:18:46] as saying this what you see means that
[1:18:48] the church cannot accomplish anything by
[1:18:51] its own might or power but by the Holy
[1:18:54] Ghost amen this is still only under
[1:18:57] sanctification you can have gifts speak
[1:19:00] with tongues you can have signs and
[1:19:02] wonders you can have all of these things
[1:19:03] he says but you're still not there yet
[1:19:05] it's good and it's a better light and it
[1:19:08] rarely goes out but it does fail from
[1:19:11] time to time because we
[1:19:13] fail amen so we see here that the holy
[1:19:17] spirit is actually dependent on us
[1:19:19] keeping our lives clean it's dependent
[1:19:21] on us making the right decision it's
[1:19:22] depending on us because we're still not
[1:19:24] in behind the veil we're the one that
[1:19:26] keeps the fire alive in our lives amen
[1:19:28] and that's when you go like brother B
[1:19:30] would say you go from revival to Revival
[1:19:32] and in between you're a miserable
[1:19:33] Christian or you're less than overcoming
[1:19:35] if I could put it that way that's not
[1:19:37] the Walk of a True Believer that you got
[1:19:39] to go to Revival after Revival there's a
[1:19:41] consistency there's a steadiness that
[1:19:43] comes when you're sealed away because
[1:19:45] you're not dependent on anything except
[1:19:47] the presence of Christ in your life amen
[1:19:49] so this here is an imperfect light and
[1:19:51] it's imperfect because of us and not the
[1:19:53] Holy
[1:19:55] Ghost but then but the scripture says
[1:19:57] let us go on under
[1:19:59] Perfection and we can sit here and we
[1:20:01] can say this is good I like where I'm at
[1:20:03] my life's cleaned up that's a good place
[1:20:04] to be where our lives are cleaned up but
[1:20:07] that's not it that's not it now you got
[1:20:09] to fill what's been cleaned what's been
[1:20:11] emptied out has to have something put
[1:20:13] into it amen and there's a place and a
[1:20:15] position of absolute rest that's
[1:20:16] available to the believer amen and it's
[1:20:18] independent of me and it's independent
[1:20:20] of you and it's independent of what's
[1:20:22] going on in our lives in that particular
[1:20:23] day and there's a place where we can
[1:20:25] take ourselves completely out of the
[1:20:27] equation and say Lord my life is in your
[1:20:29] hands and I'm trusting you but that is a
[1:20:33] battle don't get me wrong it's a battle
[1:20:34] but there is a place of rest amen
[1:20:37] Hebrews 4 says that it's our
[1:20:40] Sabbath he says but the man who walks
[1:20:44] beyond that and goes in don't just stand
[1:20:48] on the edge go in he says when the world
[1:20:51] is shut off when the veil drops around
[1:20:54] him down under the Locking of the wings
[1:20:56] of the cherabin the great shikina Glory
[1:20:59] hung under there it never got dim it
[1:21:02] never went out he said and the man who
[1:21:05] lives in the presence of God under the
[1:21:07] veil lives in the shakana glory I don't
[1:21:10] care if the storms are raging whether
[1:21:11] the clouds or the moon don't shine the
[1:21:14] Stars don't shine whether the
[1:21:15] Candlestick goes out that doesn't matter
[1:21:18] he said he is living in the shakina
[1:21:20] glory of God under the power of the Holy
[1:21:23] Ghost it didn't go out at night it
[1:21:26] didn't go out
[1:21:28] period why because this is its own
[1:21:31] source of life it is its own source of
[1:21:33] light it's not dependent on you it's not
[1:21:35] dependent on me it is self- sustaining
[1:21:39] this is a light that is always there no
[1:21:41] matter what the sun moon and stars are
[1:21:44] going to go away but that light is going
[1:21:46] to always be there brother R would point
[1:21:49] us to the holy of holies and we see in
[1:21:52] here there's no light it maybe a bit
[1:21:54] hard to see in here but there's no
[1:21:55] lights in the holy of holies in the very
[1:21:57] back there's the word there's The Mercy
[1:22:01] Seat there's blood on
[1:22:03] it and then it's the presence of God
[1:22:07] it's the word the word the word that's
[1:22:09] all that's in there it's the living
[1:22:11] presence of God in there and that means
[1:22:14] the light never goes out can you imagine
[1:22:17] being a priest and you got that
[1:22:19] Candlestick behind you and as beautiful
[1:22:21] as it is and you open this and there is
[1:22:23] no light source but yet there is a
[1:22:26] light that the pillar of fire is in
[1:22:29] there and no matter what time you go in
[1:22:32] it's never out it's never dimmed it
[1:22:35] never changes it's an everpresent source
[1:22:39] of life and light and in that light in
[1:22:42] that life in that presence the Mana
[1:22:44] never got
[1:22:45] stale and the Almond the the the stick
[1:22:49] that was dead the almond stick that was
[1:22:50] always dead buted and produced used
[1:22:52] almonds year
[1:22:54] round there's no death there there's no
[1:22:57] dissatisfaction there's no unrest it's
[1:23:00] just peace and life and joy in that
[1:23:03] presence amen he says it didn't go out
[1:23:07] he says it's kind of a Mystic light kind
[1:23:09] of a soft glowing light he says and the
[1:23:12] believer at rest walks around inside The
[1:23:15] Veil The shikina Glory where the PO Mana
[1:23:18] was where he ate daily never gave out he
[1:23:21] ate from the man oh my he had not a
[1:23:23] worry in the world everything was taken
[1:23:25] care of God was over him listening to
[1:23:29] him praise and answering his prayer cuz
[1:23:32] remember he went in there for his own
[1:23:34] soul for his own sins and then he came
[1:23:37] in and he was pleading for everybody
[1:23:38] else church when you get taken care of
[1:23:40] don't forget about the ones that are
[1:23:42] still outside waiting to get in there
[1:23:45] don't forget that there's people that
[1:23:46] need us to go in before that presence
[1:23:50] and stay there until they can come in
[1:23:52] for them El till they can come to their
[1:23:54] M their own mind they can come to
[1:23:56] themselves like that prodal son did and
[1:23:59] they can say Lord now I'm here now I've
[1:24:01] got my own access and I don't need Mom
[1:24:03] and Dad I don't need pop and Nan but I'm
[1:24:06] here
[1:24:08] now what listening to your praise and
[1:24:11] answering your
[1:24:13] prayer amen you enter his gates with
[1:24:16] Thanksgiving in your hearts and his
[1:24:17] courts with praise thank him don't turn
[1:24:21] him into a sugar daddy
[1:24:23] say thank you Lord thank you for what
[1:24:25] you've done thank you for what you're
[1:24:27] doing but Lord I'm coming and there's
[1:24:29] others that have needs as well not just
[1:24:32] me he said God was over him listening to
[1:24:35] him praise and answering his prayer not
[1:24:37] only that but he is living right in the
[1:24:39] presence of the king God in the shikina
[1:24:41] glory he said every time anything would
[1:24:44] start up like that it couldn't get to
[1:24:46] him he wouldn't listen to it he couldn't
[1:24:49] the wines of the world were on the
[1:24:51] outside church that's where I want to be
[1:24:54] every single day we got a lot of whining
[1:24:57] going on in this world we lot got a lot
[1:24:59] of dark talk a lot of Doomsday talk
[1:25:02] listen they're right the Earth is not
[1:25:04] going to hell in the hand basket it's
[1:25:06] there already it's going down brother B
[1:25:08] she's off the skids and there's no
[1:25:10] coming back she's been judged there's no
[1:25:12] coming back he's dealing with
[1:25:14] individuals now it's done okay there
[1:25:17] there's no saving this world but if the
[1:25:19] world is going down that mean the bride
[1:25:21] ought to be looking up amen remember
[1:25:24] scripture says he comes to those that
[1:25:25] love his appearing we ought to be able
[1:25:27] to read the signs of the times and say
[1:25:29] Lord the time is getting closer than it
[1:25:32] ever was before Lord I'm looking to you
[1:25:34] Lord I'm trusting in you Lord I'm
[1:25:36] expecting
[1:25:38] you that ought to be the way we're
[1:25:40] approaching every single day
[1:25:42] amen he says if you ever come into
[1:25:45] Christ my friend ever into a place where
[1:25:47] the world is dead where whether your
[1:25:51] children are this or whether your
[1:25:52] mother's this way your daddy said this
[1:25:54] whether your pastor said that whether
[1:25:56] the doctor said this or that you don't
[1:25:58] even hear it you live only in the
[1:26:00] shikina glory walking and living in the
[1:26:03] presence of the
[1:26:04] king every day is sweet to your
[1:26:08] soul I want a day where I can say this
[1:26:12] is sweet to my soul every day I don't
[1:26:15] think I'm there yet but Lord I there I
[1:26:18] believe there's a way to get there amen
[1:26:21] we're going to talk about that in a
[1:26:22] little bit he says my all is well all is
[1:26:25] well there is nothing can harm you oh
[1:26:27] what a place then he continues he says I
[1:26:30] go to church for one thing and that's to
[1:26:33] stay in your presence I moved in there
[1:26:36] Lord I never desire to leave again I'll
[1:26:38] Trust your word what you say there is
[1:26:40] where I want to be drop the veils around
[1:26:43] me Lord that I could only see Jesus
[1:26:45] alone and live and walk and die in him
[1:26:49] he says there you are he says oh God God
[1:26:52] hide me in that place hide me over in
[1:26:55] that place where all the veils will drop
[1:26:57] and I'll see nothing but Jesus himself I
[1:27:00] don't want to hear the Fantastics of the
[1:27:02] world I don't care whether they got
[1:27:03] atomic bombs whether they got a Jet
[1:27:05] Plane whether the new Chevrolets look
[1:27:07] better than the Buicks it doesn't matter
[1:27:09] the thing of it is I'm walking and
[1:27:12] living with Christ daily and I've died
[1:27:14] to self and the veils are dropped around
[1:27:16] and I in he and he and me Church we're
[1:27:20] coming to the place where we have to
[1:27:22] know who we are we've got to know that
[1:27:26] we are children of God we are sons of
[1:27:29] God we are Daughters of God that we are
[1:27:31] part of a finished work that we have a
[1:27:34] security as a child of God that nothing
[1:27:36] that Satan does can
[1:27:38] hinder he can't hold you back you've
[1:27:41] already been you've already there you've
[1:27:43] already been seen there we're already in
[1:27:45] Heavenly places in Christ and there's
[1:27:46] nothing can harm us there's nothing can
[1:27:48] hold us back nothing can keep us from
[1:27:50] the love of God working what the word
[1:27:52] has said about each and every one of us
[1:27:54] the only thing that'll slow it is what
[1:27:56] we allow and even that won't stop it
[1:27:59] it'll only hinder it cuz God will get
[1:28:01] you to a place like that prodical son
[1:28:03] remember where you come to yourself and
[1:28:05] say I don't have to live like this I
[1:28:06] don't have to look like this I don't
[1:28:08] have to deal with this I don't have to
[1:28:09] think like this and you'll die to
[1:28:11] yourself and you'll come back to the
[1:28:12] father's house and you'll be right back
[1:28:14] on the road to glory nothing's going to
[1:28:16] stop us from making a church nothing's
[1:28:18] going to stop us not even
[1:28:20] ourselves brother said you go might go
[1:28:23] all kinds of emotions carry on every way
[1:28:26] and call it in the name of religion the
[1:28:28] heathens do the same thing he says but
[1:28:29] give me a consecrated life that's dead
[1:28:33] and rose again in Christ Jesus who lives
[1:28:36] in the shikina glory with the love of
[1:28:38] God around them he said that's the
[1:28:40] person I'll believe is going to be
[1:28:42] there put me beneath the veil under the
[1:28:45] blood of the Lord Jesus take all your
[1:28:47] gifts that you have in the scripture the
[1:28:49] devil can impersonate every one of them
[1:28:51] but he can't impers personate love cuz
[1:28:53] Love's genuine the devil can't love
[1:28:55] that's one thing he can't do we can't be
[1:28:58] wondering do I have the Holy Ghost let's
[1:29:00] make our calling and election sure let's
[1:29:03] say we've got it and make sure we've got
[1:29:05] it and if we don't got it let's press
[1:29:07] till we got it CU if you don't have the
[1:29:09] Holy Ghost Church you're not going
[1:29:11] anywhere that is the only thing that's
[1:29:14] required we'll get into it when we we
[1:29:16] talk a little bit more about perfect
[1:29:18] love because only perfect love can go
[1:29:19] there and that's the holy ghost that
[1:29:22] that's you reuniting with the rest of
[1:29:23] the pillar of fire that's what's
[1:29:25] happening that's the only checkbox that
[1:29:27] they tick when you cross over Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] yes Holy Ghost no Holy Ghost yes you go
[1:29:32] up Holy Ghost no you go and you wait for
[1:29:35] final judgment it's the only thing that
[1:29:36] matters Church the token is the only
[1:29:39] thing that matters it's the only thing
[1:29:41] that takes us across
[1:29:42] amen we've got to start listening to The
[1:29:45] Cry of our heart rather than the desires
[1:29:46] of this
[1:29:47] flesh crucify It Die daily like Paul
[1:29:50] said I'm not talking about New Year's
[1:29:52] resolutions or commitments or these
[1:29:54] things but a sincere and genuine cry
[1:29:56] that says Lord I Want More not not a
[1:30:01] selfish more but I want to be where you
[1:30:03] want me to be I want to act like you
[1:30:05] want me to act I want you to live like
[1:30:07] you want me to live I want to live in
[1:30:09] your promises I want to live in your
[1:30:10] presence I want to live in your love and
[1:30:12] your joy and your
[1:30:14] peace and not settle for anything
[1:30:16] else
[1:30:19] amen you say how can I do that brother
[1:30:22] John who would say I want to be closer
[1:30:24] to God I want to be closer to God how do
[1:30:28] I do it how do we do it
[1:30:30] Church we've got to come to our own
[1:30:32] personal experience for starts you got
[1:30:35] to have your own experience with
[1:30:37] God Amen and you've got to
[1:30:40] press you've got to
[1:30:43] press familiar scripture in Matthew 11
[1:30:46] it says and from the days of John the
[1:30:47] Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:30:50] suffereth violence and and the violent
[1:30:53] take it by force now if you remember I
[1:30:55] preached on this very early on when I
[1:30:57] moved to New Finland I had to look it up
[1:30:59] it was a second service I preached when
[1:31:01] I moved back from British Columbia and I
[1:31:03] I suggest you go and listen to it and
[1:31:04] it'll help you it's called taking the
[1:31:06] kingdom by force I preached on August 16
[1:31:08] 2020 if you're trying to find it but the
[1:31:10] reason I'm referencing it is because you
[1:31:12] got to realize that there's a pressing
[1:31:14] in you had each of these courts you had
[1:31:18] to choose to walk
[1:31:20] further nobody forced you you had to
[1:31:23] walk from the outer Court to the inner
[1:31:25] court and from the inner Court into the
[1:31:27] holy of holies you have to choose you
[1:31:29] had to press and guess what they had
[1:31:31] thick thick uh drapes curtains that were
[1:31:35] there and these weren't little tiny you
[1:31:37] know the little ones we have the Lacy
[1:31:39] ones in in our windows and that these
[1:31:40] were big heavy curtains cuz the idea was
[1:31:42] that they were soundproof that was the
[1:31:45] purpose was to shut out everything every
[1:31:47] exterior noise every exterior light
[1:31:50] everything was supposed to be shut out
[1:31:52] so that it was just you and God but you
[1:31:55] got to press you got to press through
[1:31:57] those things
[1:31:59] amen listen Satan presses on us it says
[1:32:03] there the violent take it our take it by
[1:32:04] force Satan has no problem getting
[1:32:06] violent with us does he it's about time
[1:32:09] we got violent with him we're armored
[1:32:11] for it we've got a weapon for it how
[1:32:13] about we get violent with him the way he
[1:32:15] likes to get violent with us but not
[1:32:17] with hate but with the promise of God in
[1:32:20] our lips and in our t testimony to say
[1:32:22] I'm here to take what belongs to me I'm
[1:32:25] here to live the life that he's called
[1:32:26] me to live amen where are we pressing
[1:32:29] what are we pressing to
[1:32:31] get where are we violent in our
[1:32:33] intentions where have we gotten serious
[1:32:37] lately I'm preaching to myself here
[1:32:40] Church by that I mean who or what are we
[1:32:43] trying to overcome what are we trying to
[1:32:44] achieve what are we trying to get what
[1:32:46] are we trying to get rid of whatever the
[1:32:48] case may be what is it that we are
[1:32:50] getting forceful with with amen where's
[1:32:53] our Victory where's our rejoicing by
[1:32:57] that I say where is it not do we have it
[1:32:59] but where are we rejoicing where we're
[1:33:01] rejoicing and where we're declaring
[1:33:02] Victory tells us where we've been
[1:33:04] fighting where your celebration is
[1:33:06] that's probably where you've been using
[1:33:08] some
[1:33:09] force and by force I mean trusting the
[1:33:11] word of God using the word of God
[1:33:13] believing the word of God putting it on
[1:33:14] your lips putting it on your
[1:33:17] mind that's how you know where you've
[1:33:19] been pressing is where you've gotten
[1:33:20] Victory lately
[1:33:22] amen this isn't a selfish intention but
[1:33:25] we're talking about coming into our
[1:33:27] position in our walk with God where he
[1:33:28] means for us to be that's all saying
[1:33:32] Lord I'm going to press into what you
[1:33:33] have for me and leave the rest of this
[1:33:36] behind amen we've got to get deliberate
[1:33:39] about
[1:33:41] it that's one thing I've noticed as I've
[1:33:43] been studying these things is that it
[1:33:45] takes deliberate intention this isn't
[1:33:49] Hocus
[1:33:50] Pocus we've got choice choices to make
[1:33:53] and we decide how our day goes so many
[1:33:55] times it's our choice how we start it
[1:33:58] and how we go through it and how we
[1:34:00] finish it so often is about us because
[1:34:02] remember the scripture says we read it a
[1:34:04] couple Services ago God hasn't changed
[1:34:05] his arm hasn't gotten short that he
[1:34:07] can't save he's not deaf that he can't
[1:34:09] hear us the problem is never God the
[1:34:11] problem is are we accessing him are we
[1:34:13] using him are we going to him are we
[1:34:15] trusting him the way that we're supposed
[1:34:17] to amen so it starts with a deliberation
[1:34:19] in our heart and our soul and then it
[1:34:21] comes out in everything else amen when
[1:34:24] we say Lord I want to be in your
[1:34:25] presence on a daily
[1:34:27] basis brother Brandon puts it this way
[1:34:30] he said Solomon said as a man thinketh
[1:34:32] in his heart so is
[1:34:34] he you say I don't like where I am
[1:34:38] what's in your
[1:34:39] heart cuz you are where you are because
[1:34:41] of that's where your heart being or
[1:34:42] that's where you've chosen to
[1:34:44] focus he says
[1:34:46] begin begin to think that you're one of
[1:34:50] his children that he saved you and he's
[1:34:53] good to you and you love him and he
[1:34:55] loves you we're talking about how do we
[1:34:57] walk in the light how do we come into
[1:34:58] the presence of God
[1:34:59] Church begin by thinking you're one of
[1:35:02] his
[1:35:03] children now I hope you are but his
[1:35:06] point is if you are start thinking about
[1:35:08] it start thinking about the fact that
[1:35:11] God has not just called you but he's
[1:35:13] chosen you he's predestinated you he's
[1:35:15] elected you to be a part of an end time
[1:35:18] bride he says in that you're one of his
[1:35:20] children and he saved you he's good to
[1:35:24] you and you love him and he loves you
[1:35:27] now catch says don't just wait till you
[1:35:28] go to church or some convenient hour
[1:35:31] just keep him on your mind all the time
[1:35:33] and he's actually talking about Mary you
[1:35:35] know Mary and Joseph Mary he says and as
[1:35:38] she went on walking down the street
[1:35:40] there was no one yet on the street and
[1:35:43] as she walked along the little dirt path
[1:35:44] for a sidewalk all of a sudden she began
[1:35:46] to realize that there was something
[1:35:47] around her a real strange feeling oh
[1:35:50] that's the most wonderful experience he
[1:35:52] says I trust that everybody here has
[1:35:54] experience them kind of times he says if
[1:35:56] you haven't this will be a good night to
[1:35:59] start you know I hope brother Doug and
[1:36:01] sister Beverly don't mind me saying this
[1:36:03] but I was at their house when I when I
[1:36:05] was gone hunting of course a couple
[1:36:06] weeks ago and I went to use the bathroom
[1:36:10] and as soon as I was in the bathroom for
[1:36:13] 15 seconds they both broke out into
[1:36:15] songs completely different songs but
[1:36:17] they broke into songs you know why it is
[1:36:20] because whenever get a quiet moment what
[1:36:22] do they start do they start praising God
[1:36:26] and it just happens I don't believe
[1:36:28] brother dog and sister Beverly I don't
[1:36:29] even think you know that you're doing it
[1:36:31] but they both started singing completely
[1:36:33] different songs and then when I came out
[1:36:35] they shut up and we went back to
[1:36:36] fellowshipping why because there was
[1:36:38] something in their heart that yearned to
[1:36:41] be in the presence of God and that was
[1:36:43] giving him praise and worship all the
[1:36:44] time and every time I've been out with
[1:36:46] brother Doug and sister Beverly in the
[1:36:48] car or in their home they start singing
[1:36:50] eventually why because there's something
[1:36:52] inside of him that wants to draw close
[1:36:54] to God and it keeps him in a right
[1:36:56] atmosphere it keeps him in a right
[1:36:58] attitude it keeps him in a right frame
[1:36:59] of mind it was a good lesson for me I do
[1:37:02] it too if I go in the shower if I get a
[1:37:04] quiet time I'll start whistling or
[1:37:05] singing I like to do it but not all of
[1:37:08] us like to do it but we ought to do it
[1:37:10] and this is what brother Brandon's
[1:37:11] saying you've got to start doing
[1:37:13] something to draw towards God you got to
[1:37:16] take a step towards God and guess up
[1:37:18] worship and praise is a good way to
[1:37:20] start it you can do that you say I don't
[1:37:23] feel like it that's why you worship cuz
[1:37:24] worship has nothing to do with how you
[1:37:26] feel and everything to do with who he is
[1:37:27] and what he is now praise Praises for
[1:37:30] what he does worship for who he is you
[1:37:33] can worship him anytime church cuz he's
[1:37:35] always God he's always good he's always
[1:37:38] great he's always powerful we can
[1:37:41] worship him all day long it has nothing
[1:37:43] to do with how life's going now praise
[1:37:45] praise tends to be more dependent
[1:37:46] doesn't it but you'll see that they LED
[1:37:48] them in Praise when they went into the
[1:37:50] battle the priesthood would lead them
[1:37:52] into praise when they go out in the
[1:37:54] battle and that was to set their hearts
[1:37:55] right to get the
[1:37:57] victory Amen brother Braham says this
[1:37:59] we're talking how do I come into the
[1:38:01] presence of God how do I dwell in the
[1:38:03] presence of God he says just start
[1:38:06] thinking about him and worship him in
[1:38:08] your heart and all of a sudden you'll
[1:38:10] feel the close Fellowship of the holy
[1:38:12] spirit all around you he didn't say
[1:38:15] immediately he says one minute he's not
[1:38:18] there the next he is there it's not that
[1:38:20] he was never churches that you maybe
[1:38:22] didn't realize he wasn't there but all
[1:38:24] of a sudden now you're in a place where
[1:38:25] you can recognize the presence of God
[1:38:28] remember we talked about it I don't know
[1:38:29] if it last service a couple Services ago
[1:38:31] how even the prophet remember he got
[1:38:33] wound up CU Jehoshaphat was doing
[1:38:35] another thing with another king he
[1:38:36] shouldn't have and then they got stuck
[1:38:37] in the desert 7 days out no water no
[1:38:39] food and they said to the prophet we
[1:38:41] need help and he says call me a Minstrel
[1:38:44] call me a
[1:38:45] musician cuz I'm just not happy and then
[1:38:48] the minstrel the musician put him in an
[1:38:51] an atmosphere where he could hear the
[1:38:52] right words from
[1:38:53] God you can put yourself in the right
[1:38:56] attitude start singing some songs if you
[1:38:58] can't sing let somebody else sing for
[1:38:59] you turn it
[1:39:01] on he says all of a sudden you'll feel
[1:39:04] the close Fellowship of the holy spirit
[1:39:05] all around you and it gets so anointed
[1:39:07] till you can't hold it any
[1:39:09] longer you'll raise up your hands or do
[1:39:12] something you just can't stand still
[1:39:14] when it comes and as she was thinking
[1:39:16] not noticing who is around her the
[1:39:18] little lady perhaps with a pair of
[1:39:19] sandals on her feet while walking along
[1:39:21] this little Dusty path but thinking of
[1:39:23] the Lord and of his promises of things
[1:39:25] to come and as she was sinking all of a
[1:39:28] sudden that feeling got so great around
[1:39:31] her till she raised up her
[1:39:35] head and when she did standing before
[1:39:38] her was a
[1:39:40] light and standing by that light was
[1:39:42] Gabriel the Angel the Archangel of God
[1:39:45] he said if you want angels to appear to
[1:39:47] you keep your mind on God and off the
[1:39:50] things things of the world go about your
[1:39:53] business go to your church go to your
[1:39:55] washing of dishes wherever you are keep
[1:39:58] your mind on him all day and all night
[1:40:01] long he says then God will do something
[1:40:04] you're drawing close to him you've got
[1:40:06] the world shut out it's just you and he
[1:40:10] are together listen Paul and Silas sang
[1:40:14] and prayed while in the prison
[1:40:17] stocks now I don't know about you I
[1:40:20] haven't been in prison socks lately I
[1:40:22] haven't been in cold heart stone in a in
[1:40:24] a stinky drafty jail in a long time ever
[1:40:29] basically if they can sing and they can
[1:40:32] worship and they can praise and they can
[1:40:35] pray in that what's our
[1:40:37] excuse have things gotten so bad
[1:40:40] remember Paul said you haven't resisted
[1:40:41] till you bled yet I think sometimes we
[1:40:44] Elevate our pain and our
[1:40:46] suffering and it's because we don't want
[1:40:49] to actually get out of it really we want
[1:40:51] to stay in our little poor me thing
[1:40:55] rather than saying there's a higher
[1:40:56] plane for me to live there's a different
[1:40:58] way that I can go through this situation
[1:41:00] I can go through it with a lot different
[1:41:01] attitude if I'll just press a little if
[1:41:05] I'll fight a little if you can't focus
[1:41:08] on the on pushing the situation away
[1:41:11] focus on lifting God up to where he is
[1:41:13] amen Elevate him he deserves our glory
[1:41:15] and our praise focus on him and pretty
[1:41:17] soon you'll find you'll start to come
[1:41:18] right along with it remember what I said
[1:41:21] it's not complicated but it's
[1:41:23] challenging this is what we're talking
[1:41:25] about Paul and Silas would do it church
[1:41:28] I've had remember brother B says you get
[1:41:29] where you can't hold it in any longer
[1:41:31] raise up your hands or something I've
[1:41:32] had that happen in my car I've had that
[1:41:34] happen at my desk while studying I've
[1:41:37] had that happen in my comfy little chair
[1:41:39] that I use for my
[1:41:40] devotions I've had that driving back and
[1:41:42] forth to Grand Falls hunting I've had it
[1:41:45] happen out in the woods it doesn't
[1:41:48] matter where you are you put your mind
[1:41:50] on him and you start dwelling on the
[1:41:52] things of God and he comes your way you
[1:41:55] say well I'm I'm just some I'm down I'm
[1:41:58] depleted listen on the road to Emmas
[1:42:01] they were sad and weary but they were
[1:42:03] talking about him and brother Bram says
[1:42:05] when you talk about him he tends to come
[1:42:08] along that's
[1:42:09] it church is it hard it's not it's not
[1:42:14] hard to understand but it's hard to do
[1:42:16] it's hard to say I'm going to lay down
[1:42:18] my right to be upset to be sad to be
[1:42:21] worried to be depressed to be stressed
[1:42:24] and say Lord I'm going to lift you up
[1:42:25] for a while I'm going to start talking
[1:42:27] about you I'm going to start thinking
[1:42:28] good things I'm going to start dwelling
[1:42:30] on the things you've done for me and see
[1:42:32] where that takes me I mean if we're not
[1:42:35] happy where we're at it doesn't hurt to
[1:42:36] try to go someplace else does it it's
[1:42:39] not that hard but it's a choice it's
[1:42:42] deliberate it's deliberate every single
[1:42:45] time and I'll tell you when God drops in
[1:42:48] and I've shared some of those moments
[1:42:49] with this church and I preached from
[1:42:51] moments 15 seconds in the presence of
[1:42:53] God will change your day for weeks it's
[1:42:56] the way it works because he doesn't just
[1:42:58] come down to be there he comes down with
[1:43:00] purpose he comes down with intention he
[1:43:02] comes there to speak I have learned
[1:43:05] things I have heard things I have
[1:43:06] understood things in a way I've never
[1:43:08] before just with a a short moment when
[1:43:11] he's there and I know he's there I know
[1:43:13] that I know that I know he's there and
[1:43:15] it changes your outlook it changes your
[1:43:18] approach it changes your attitude it
[1:43:21] humbles you it settles you and you walk
[1:43:24] away a different person and the goal is
[1:43:27] to be a different person every day of
[1:43:30] Our Lives Amen to win the battle with
[1:43:32] this flesh because it's a battle every
[1:43:35] single day what if we could press into
[1:43:38] that every day it's not a question of
[1:43:41] can we it's a question of will
[1:43:44] we God said I'll never leave you or
[1:43:47] forsake
[1:43:48] you it reminds me of the story
[1:43:51] and I think many men have shared this
[1:43:53] and I don't know who started it
[1:43:55] but you know this man and his wife were
[1:43:58] married for quite some time and they
[1:44:00] always had a pickup truck with a bench
[1:44:03] seat and you know after 20 years she
[1:44:05] looked at them from over in the far seat
[1:44:08] she said honey she said how come you
[1:44:11] know you don't cuddle up to me in the
[1:44:13] truck anymore you where'd the love go he
[1:44:16] said honey I'm in the same seat I've
[1:44:18] always been
[1:44:19] in God ain't moved church God ain't
[1:44:22] moved we move we take ourselves away
[1:44:27] he's there you know we we sing that song
[1:44:30] Standing somewhere in the shadows you'll
[1:44:31] find Jesus where right where you left
[1:44:33] him he hasn't left he hasn't walked away
[1:44:36] he hasn't grown cold he hasn't Lost That
[1:44:39] Loving Feeling we have we pull away we
[1:44:42] get distracted we decide something else
[1:44:45] is worth our time our effort our praise
[1:44:47] our energy and what happens is we lose
[1:44:50] Lo the victory we lose the victory over
[1:44:52] our attitude we lose the victory over
[1:44:54] our thoughts we Lo the lose the victory
[1:44:55] over our love for the brothers and
[1:44:58] sisters and then we got to fight all the
[1:45:00] harder to get back but it's still got to
[1:45:03] be a pressing Choice every single day
[1:45:07] amen if we could just turn off the
[1:45:11] phones put the books away just get quiet
[1:45:14] for a little bit each day and say Lord
[1:45:18] I'm here to be in your presence
[1:45:21] and not just on your
[1:45:24] time remember but throughout your day
[1:45:28] cuz we don't have all day to do it we
[1:45:31] can't sit around all day waiting for the
[1:45:32] presence of God we've got obligations
[1:45:34] we've got family obligations we've got
[1:45:36] job obligations but throughout your day
[1:45:38] let them know Lord I'm thinking of
[1:45:40] you and if you struggle with that do
[1:45:42] what the good Germans do and plug it
[1:45:44] into your phone and remind yourself to
[1:45:46] stop every little bit throughout the day
[1:45:48] and pretty soon you'll find you start
[1:45:49] doing it just
[1:45:52] automatically just stop and say Lord I
[1:45:56] love you Lord I'm thinking about brother
[1:45:58] Ivan Lord you see sisters so and so Lord
[1:46:01] you remember this situation Lord thank
[1:46:03] you for what you've done thank you that
[1:46:05] what I've been praying about for weeks
[1:46:07] for years you finally answered that
[1:46:10] prayer and you've given me Victory
[1:46:12] you've given me healing whatever it is
[1:46:13] if he's done something praise him that's
[1:46:15] the best way to start but otherwise just
[1:46:17] say Lord I'm looking to you I'm trusting
[1:46:19] in you and I want to be where you are
[1:46:23] amen give our minds to him set the
[1:46:25] distractions
[1:46:26] aside listen this is what it's going to
[1:46:29] look at the end Revelation 21:23 says
[1:46:32] and the city had no need of the sun
[1:46:35] neither of the moon to shine in it for
[1:46:37] the glory of God did lighten it and the
[1:46:40] lamb is the light thereof doesn't say
[1:46:42] there's no sun moon or Stars it says it
[1:46:44] doesn't need it cuz there's a light
[1:46:46] that's there but you notice it says the
[1:46:47] glory of God did lighten it remember
[1:46:50] read the scripture the other day that
[1:46:51] said that the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:46:53] upon thee that's you that's me we're
[1:46:57] there and he's there that's what it
[1:47:00] looks like church if we don't like the
[1:47:03] light here we're not going to like the
[1:47:04] light there I like what brother Braham
[1:47:05] say he says if you think if you don't
[1:47:06] like it getting loud in a church service
[1:47:08] here you're not going to like heaven cuz
[1:47:09] it's a really loud place there's a lot
[1:47:11] of worship and praise going on in heaven
[1:47:13] guess what there's a lot of light
[1:47:14] there's a lot of Glory in heaven church
[1:47:16] we might as well get used to it down
[1:47:17] here cuz that's where we're meant to
[1:47:19] dwell amen that's what're supposed to
[1:47:23] be one more
[1:47:26] quote said then God told Moses and Aaron
[1:47:29] go make a great golden pot and fill it
[1:47:31] full of mana and put it in the holiest
[1:47:33] of holy places by the ark this Mana was
[1:47:36] to be set by the ark and there it never
[1:47:39] failed it never got old it never lost
[1:47:42] its sweetness it was always good inside
[1:47:47] there he says did you ever meet a person
[1:47:49] that's been in there
[1:47:50] and has tasted and living on this Mana
[1:47:53] you can meet him on Monday Tuesday
[1:47:55] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday or
[1:47:57] Sunday a cloudy day a bright day a
[1:47:59] gloomy day things going right going
[1:48:01] wrong he is always sweet always full of
[1:48:04] love never to talk or do anything wrong
[1:48:08] he is living under the glory of God why
[1:48:11] the glory of the Lord has risen upon him
[1:48:14] he never gets hungry he never has to go
[1:48:16] to church to get built up he is just
[1:48:19] always full of God Amen if the musicians
[1:48:23] would come let's stand together if we
[1:48:26] would he is just always full of God how
[1:48:30] many would say this evening that's my
[1:48:31] desire amen I want to always be full of
[1:48:34] God Amen I want to be in a place where I
[1:48:35] don't feel the need to defend myself
[1:48:38] where I can react in love every time
[1:48:40] where I can be at peace no matter what's
[1:48:42] happening you say it's not possible
[1:48:44] brother John the only thing that makes
[1:48:46] it impossible is whether I decide I want
[1:48:47] to be there or not cuz God has made a
[1:48:49] place of rest available to each and
[1:48:51] every one of us amen I know there's a
[1:48:53] place to go but I've got a fight to get
[1:48:55] there here's the thing he's called me to
[1:48:57] be there he's told me there's a place of
[1:48:59] rest there's a place of Joy there's a
[1:49:01] place of love all of these things so
[1:49:05] it's up to me if I'm going to say Lord I
[1:49:06] want to be there or just settle for
[1:49:09] staying where Humanity keeps us every
[1:49:11] day amen we have so many
[1:49:13] blessings we're blessed we're blessed
[1:49:16] with the roof over our head with the
[1:49:18] cars we drive the jobs we have the in
[1:49:20] the bank we have but the greatest
[1:49:22] blessing we have is that we can come
[1:49:23] into the presence of God every single
[1:49:25] day the scepter is always out to us like
[1:49:28] Esther he's never unhappy to see us he's
[1:49:32] always wanting to spend time with his
[1:49:34] children Amen brother Brown would say
[1:49:36] why are people so tossed
[1:49:38] about we feel un tossed about worried
[1:49:42] stressed tired out sick of being
[1:49:46] sick there's a place where you can go
[1:49:50] and there the presence of God takes care
[1:49:52] of everything
[1:49:54] amen I said it earlier it's not
[1:49:56] complicated but it's a
[1:49:57] challenge what does he say you want to
[1:50:00] get close to God you want to come into
[1:50:01] His presence you got to think on God you
[1:50:04] got to worship God you've got to dwell
[1:50:06] on God and the things of God and
[1:50:09] separate yourself from the world it's a
[1:50:11] challenge but it's not
[1:50:13] complicated Amen brother Braham said
[1:50:15] when you think on him when you talk
[1:50:17] about him he comes around amen let's
[1:50:19] think about him let's talk about him
[1:50:22] let's dwell on him
[1:50:24] amen it's a simple thing but it's a
[1:50:26] battle every day to get in this in his
[1:50:28] presence amen but that'll take care of
[1:50:31] the situation it won't take the
[1:50:33] situation away every time but it'll take
[1:50:35] care of the situation because it'll take
[1:50:37] care of you it'll let you know that you
[1:50:39] can rest even when the storm's there you
[1:50:41] know I I wanted to bring a quote but it
[1:50:43] was so long not for this service it was
[1:50:44] more for the last service where brother
[1:50:46] Brandon would talk about when the
[1:50:48] disciples were in the in the in the the
[1:50:50] boat remember and Jesus said I'm going
[1:50:51] to go up on the mountain to pray you
[1:50:53] guys cross over and I'll meet you over
[1:50:54] there he said now he went up on the
[1:50:56] mountain he says and they went on there
[1:50:58] and as soon as they went out and they're
[1:50:59] in the middle of the of the of the ocean
[1:51:01] there the the lake or whatever the storm
[1:51:04] comes up he says where was Christ he
[1:51:06] said he was on that mountain watching
[1:51:08] them the entire
[1:51:10] time he knew what was going on he knew
[1:51:14] their fears he knew their problems he
[1:51:15] knew their situation he knew how low the
[1:51:17] the boat was getting in the water he
[1:51:19] knew how much time they had left before
[1:51:21] that thing sank and when the time was
[1:51:23] right he walked on the water to come and
[1:51:25] save them from it all he was watching
[1:51:28] the entire
[1:51:29] time if only they'd have called instead
[1:51:32] of
[1:51:33] cried if they'd have confessed their
[1:51:35] faith rather than worried their way
[1:51:37] through the situation amen he's always
[1:51:39] watching he's always available he's
[1:51:42] always ready to come to our help
[1:51:44] amen he's just asking us to come to
[1:51:48] Him scripture says drawn near to him and
[1:51:50] he'll draw near to you call on the name
[1:51:53] of the Lord and you'll be saved it's all
[1:51:55] we have to do dwell on him and he starts
[1:51:58] to come around amen let's Close Our
[1:52:03] Eyes Lord
[1:52:06] Jesus Lord if there's one thing Satan's
[1:52:08] good at these days it's distracting us
[1:52:11] trying to get our Eyes Off Of You Lord
[1:52:14] trying to get our eyes off of the word
[1:52:16] promises you've given us Lord trying to
[1:52:18] get us away from recognizing who and
[1:52:20] what we are but Lord your Prophet came
[1:52:23] and he said when you realize who you are
[1:52:24] the Rapture is going to go when you
[1:52:27] realize who you are then Satan can't
[1:52:29] stay on your property he can't stay in
[1:52:30] your house he can't stay in your life
[1:52:33] and Lord I believe we need to recognize
[1:52:35] more than ever who we are who you say we
[1:52:37] are Lord who you made us who you've
[1:52:40] called us to be who you've for ordained
[1:52:42] us to be heavenly father and Lord we can
[1:52:45] only get there if we dwell on the things
[1:52:46] of God lord if we can lay aside every
[1:52:49] little sin and everything that easily
[1:52:51] besets us Lord if we can lay down our
[1:52:53] phones if we can put aside our
[1:52:55] distractions Lord if we can just say
[1:52:57] Lord I'm here and I'm here to talk to
[1:52:59] you Lord I'm here to dwell on the good
[1:53:01] things of God Lord I'm here to present
[1:53:03] my situation to you Lord and not get
[1:53:06] ourselves distracted by the quote
[1:53:08] unquote reality of the situation Lord
[1:53:10] but to look to the promise of the word
[1:53:12] Lord that you'll never leave us you'll
[1:53:13] never forsake us Lord that you do all
[1:53:16] things well Lord and that everything
[1:53:18] that's in our lives will work for our
[1:53:19] good good if we'll walk according to
[1:53:21] your word Lord draw us into your
[1:53:23] presence I pray Lord you see the desires
[1:53:26] of our hearts Lord you see the sincere
[1:53:29] desires of our hearts Lord I believe
[1:53:31] everyone here wants to be closer to you
[1:53:34] Lord I believe every one of us needs to
[1:53:35] be closer to you Lord I'm raising my
[1:53:38] hand this
[1:53:39] evening Lord I'm saying make us closer
[1:53:42] to you draw us closer to you Lord let us
[1:53:45] step away from everything that holds us
[1:53:47] back Lord let us lay down everything
[1:53:50] Lord let us just step into your presence
[1:53:53] Lord press through the veil Lord God
[1:53:56] lord not be satisfied with where we're
[1:53:58] at Lord but to trust that as you've
[1:54:00] called us Lord you'll meet us in the
[1:54:02] place that you've called us to be Lord
[1:54:04] grant it to your people we ask in Jesus
