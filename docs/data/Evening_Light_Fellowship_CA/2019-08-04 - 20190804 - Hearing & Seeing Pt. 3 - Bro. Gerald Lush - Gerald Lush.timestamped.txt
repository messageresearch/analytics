[1:01:21] pasture amen and the Sheep of his hand
[1:01:28] today if he will hear his voice today if
[1:01:33] you will hear his voice today and we
[1:01:37] ministering on I have heard but now I
[1:01:38] see make sure we're hearing the voice of
[1:01:41] God not the voice of the devil but it
[1:01:44] says today if he will hear his voice if
[1:01:48] you will hear the word harden not your
[1:01:52] heart
[1:01:54] as in the provocation and as in the day
[1:01:58] of temptation in the wilderness but they
[1:02:02] wouldn't listen to God they would listen
[1:02:05] to man but not in the Lord they wouldn't
[1:02:08] listen to God through Moses they
[1:02:09] wouldn't listen to God
[1:02:10] through Joshua and Caleb but then it's
[1:02:13] knew God through the false prophets a
[1:02:16] man God had mercy that we're going to
[1:02:19] listen to God through his word and it
[1:02:23] says when your father's tempted me they
[1:02:27] tempted God with their unbelief brother
[1:02:30] we attempt God the same way as with her
[1:02:32] unbelief or with our doubt and it says
[1:02:37] they proved me and saw my work but still
[1:02:43] they refused to take him at his word and
[1:02:46] it's a generation that's refusing even
[1:02:49] the day to take God at His Word in spite
[1:02:53] of what God has done in the light of all
[1:02:55] that God has said in the light of all
[1:02:57] that God has revealed they're going to
[1:02:58] do what's right in their own eyes now
[1:03:00] I'm walking in the spirit not led by the
[1:03:02] spirit but they're walking by a holy
[1:03:05] spirit the fall spirit a man walking by
[1:03:08] the leadership of the devil not the
[1:03:09] leadership of God grace to us 40 years
[1:03:14] long was I agree with this generation
[1:03:17] and said it is a people that do err in
[1:03:20] their heart we're going to make our
[1:03:23] calling election sure by going down into
[1:03:25] the heart amen
[1:03:27] because they're calling an election is
[1:03:29] in the heart are calling an election is
[1:03:32] in our souls it's the confirmation it is
[1:03:35] the vindication that is God calling me
[1:03:39] it's God calling you it is God
[1:03:41] ministering to you it is God ministering
[1:03:43] to me it is not it is not justifiable
[1:03:47] ministry it is it is God in the fight
[1:03:50] for ministry it is God through the
[1:03:52] faithful ministry he's not there to
[1:03:54] entertain us a man not not by any means
[1:03:57] he's there to purchase he's there to
[1:03:59] teach us he's there to encourage us a
[1:04:01] man
[1:04:02] well his word he's there to increase our
[1:04:05] faith because there's any
[1:04:07] that we need is Inc more faith a man by
[1:04:11] the grace of Almighty why because it is
[1:04:13] faith that pleases God we want the faith
[1:04:16] that pleases God it is not just to say I
[1:04:19] believe this I believe that yeah but in
[1:04:21] your head but you got to believe it in
[1:04:22] your heart God is looking for in your
[1:04:25] heart a man and the Lord has been
[1:04:27] bringing me back to this message here
[1:04:30] again on I have heard but now I see and
[1:04:33] it's been a burden on my heart he said
[1:04:35] go back and I want you to go back over
[1:04:36] these things again because they need it
[1:04:39] a man so I'm just following the
[1:04:42] leadership of what I feel is the Lord
[1:04:43] and the anointing of the Holy Ghost to
[1:04:45] go back over the things I've already
[1:04:47] preached and over the things I've
[1:04:49] already quoted a man in the message
[1:04:51] concerning I have heard but now I see in
[1:04:54] 19 and 65 I believe one of the
[1:04:56] significant message and one of the
[1:04:58] important messages for the bride
[1:04:59] just before God took the profit off the
[1:05:02] seen a man so God ever the ablest I have
[1:05:05] a and the heir of the soul and have the
[1:05:07] eye of the soul to hear what God is
[1:05:09] saying to see what God is saying here
[1:05:11] what God has done and to see what he has
[1:05:13] done
[1:05:14] Amen so I pray the grace of God you bear
[1:05:16] with me as we go through these things
[1:05:18] again and the Lord want me to highlight
[1:05:20] this and I like that before I get maybe
[1:05:24] two or three or four or five times but I
[1:05:26] said okay Lord I'll do it I didn't
[1:05:27] personally in myself I didn't want to do
[1:05:29] it I want to move on to this and move on
[1:05:31] to that but the Lord said no I want you
[1:05:34] to go back to this and I want you to
[1:05:36] write I want you to repeat this a man so
[1:05:39] the grace of God to us as we get into
[1:05:41] that word again as we get into that
[1:05:43] message again by the grace of God that
[1:05:46] we're going to hear it well your what
[1:05:47] God wants us to hear and we're going to
[1:05:49] see when God wants us to see a man it is
[1:05:53] just not a revelation but it's got to be
[1:05:56] the revelation it has got to be Christ
[1:05:58] reveal himself to you in your heart not
[1:06:02] your head not your feelings is in your
[1:06:04] soul a man and then brother we're night
[1:06:06] with absolutely the soul is not
[1:06:09] depending on your feelings your soul is
[1:06:11] not going by sight because old is
[1:06:12] absolutely faint a man it is God that
[1:06:16] worketh in you willing to do of his good
[1:06:18] pleasure by the grace of God so
[1:06:20] in prayer as we move from the scriptures
[1:06:23] eventually and get into the this message
[1:06:25] again and quotes that I've already
[1:06:27] quoted but they're sayings that the
[1:06:29] prophet and then the Lord rather would
[1:06:30] want me to highlight a man and only that
[1:06:33] it was it was just a few days ago that
[1:06:35] our brother Matthew had sent me a quote
[1:06:38] by one of our black for administering
[1:06:40] brethren I don't know where he is
[1:06:42] whether it's here in Africa what country
[1:06:44] is saying but when I when I looked at
[1:06:47] the quote it was it was from this
[1:06:50] message that I've that I've been
[1:06:51] ministering on I have heard but now I
[1:06:54] see Amen I should thank you Lord and I
[1:06:58] remember that I remember the quote I
[1:07:00] remember the paragraph then that the
[1:07:02] brother mentioned so brother were
[1:07:04] wherever he was God was dealing with him
[1:07:07] in that message God is dealing with us
[1:07:09] here in that message amen and we might
[1:07:11] be separated by miles and miles and
[1:07:14] miles countries amen
[1:07:16] so I pray the will of God be done please
[1:07:18] I pray grace that we're going to have
[1:07:20] the Holy Ghost in our soul a man to hear
[1:07:23] the word in our soul and not in our
[1:07:24] heads a man because there's too many
[1:07:27] with intellectual knowledge of this
[1:07:29] message they got an intellectual
[1:07:31] revelation of this message but it's not
[1:07:32] spiritual a man is not owned by the Holy
[1:07:35] Ghost and it's not God it's the devil a
[1:07:38] man for the grace of God the Bible says
[1:07:42] in verse ten forty years long was I
[1:07:45] agree with this generation a man that
[1:07:48] God dealt with in the wilderness after
[1:07:50] bringing them out of Egypt and again
[1:07:52] it's been many years that God has been
[1:07:54] dealing with a generation after brought
[1:07:56] us out of a denominational Egyptian
[1:07:58] bondage that's where the father God
[1:08:00] referred to we were brought out of
[1:08:03] denominational Egyptian bondage the same
[1:08:06] as Israel but a tavern a chiral edge
[1:08:08] Egypt were brought it out of their
[1:08:10] spiritual Egypt a man it was a spiritual
[1:08:14] Egypt a man and that we were slaves to a
[1:08:17] spiritual Egypt a man but God has
[1:08:20] brought us out a man by grace for
[1:08:23] deliverance to take us as he wanted to
[1:08:25] do there he wants to take us into the
[1:08:28] promised land a man not getting caught
[1:08:30] up with what's going on in this world
[1:08:31] but getting caught out what's going on
[1:08:33] in a turn
[1:08:34] by the grace of God so he said 40 years
[1:08:37] long was I agreed with this generation
[1:08:39] and said it is the people that do err in
[1:08:42] their heart a man if there's got to see
[1:08:46] anything is the error in our hearts he
[1:08:49] may it's error in our souls if God it is
[1:08:52] - one wants to do anything it is to
[1:08:54] purge and to cleanse us from the inside
[1:08:56] out a man from the soul and the spirit
[1:09:00] and the body amen but it's got to start
[1:09:03] in the soul and brothers no not not just
[1:09:06] to put on the the garment no no we got
[1:09:08] have we got to put it on in the soul got
[1:09:10] a white garment on the inside of the
[1:09:12] inside of the revealed word amen and God
[1:09:15] deals with us in our soul so his word by
[1:09:18] the Holy Ghost in our souls the word in
[1:09:20] our soul and then God a minister to us
[1:09:23] in our human spirits a man and then God
[1:09:26] through the spirit the human spirit you
[1:09:27] go forth the Holy Ghost to minister and
[1:09:30] control your body a man by grace God
[1:09:34] Elvis amen
[1:09:36] make sure yours not in your flesh is not
[1:09:38] in your mind is not just a human spirit
[1:09:40] but it's in your soul the pop of Gaza
[1:09:42] you can have God in your flesh
[1:09:43] twenty-four hours a day and go to hell
[1:09:45] and you could have great experience God
[1:09:47] in your spirit but still not be in your
[1:09:50] soul and still be lost
[1:09:51] amen you can be healed he said then go
[1:09:53] to hell a man but he why he said because
[1:09:56] we your motive wasn't right and your
[1:09:58] objector wasn't right a mate and he
[1:10:00] brings that out again in this message
[1:10:02] right here if you want God to do this
[1:10:03] you want God to do that he said why do
[1:10:05] you want God to do it he said it's for
[1:10:07] the glory of God is for your own benefit
[1:10:09] amen
[1:10:11] many want God to do this and do this do
[1:10:13] this for their own benefit but it's not
[1:10:15] for the glory of God amen brother we're
[1:10:18] not living for ourselves we're living
[1:10:19] for him let's give him the glory amen by
[1:10:22] the grace of Almighty God again I have
[1:10:24] urged mine now I see a trusting by grace
[1:10:27] we have heard it in our soul we have we
[1:10:29] see it in our soul a man and through the
[1:10:32] soul that is coming to your spirit and
[1:10:34] through the soul that is made flesh in
[1:10:35] you a man so but about too many are
[1:10:38] plenty of putting in the flesh but it's
[1:10:40] not getting to the soul amen brother he
[1:10:43] said God got to go down right down
[1:10:45] beyond your your thoughts beyond your
[1:10:47] spirit into your soul amen so that we're

[1:11:08] Ministry of that ministry it's a
[1:11:10] relationship with Christ amen but again

[1:11:16] of the Saints and then bring us in more
[1:11:18] and more perfection in Christ amen
[1:11:21] by the grace of God and he said it is

[1:11:27] amen and they have not known my ways
[1:11:31] amazing they have none after all that
[1:11:34] God did with them and for them in Egypt
[1:11:36] and in the in the wilderness ending
[1:11:38] coming out brother they did not know God
[1:11:42] amen and they did not know the ways of
[1:11:44] God surely after all we've seen after
[1:11:47] all we've heard that we know God we know
[1:11:49] the ways of God and we know why God is
[1:11:51] requiring of us where we know what God
[1:11:54] is looking for in you and in me

[1:12:14] God has done and all that God is doing
[1:12:16] what's gone through doing it for it's
[1:12:19] not just to get us out of the

[1:12:35] God and to get us back to eternity amen
[1:12:38] he knows where we come from and he's
[1:12:41] trying to give us the revelation where
[1:12:42] we come from so we want to get back
[1:12:44] amen by the grace of Almighty God and it
[1:12:48] says they do err in their hearts I pray
[1:12:50] grace that you're not in error in your
[1:12:53] heart amen
[1:12:55] but many are there's a part of God so
[1:12:59] you can go in history so you can
[1:13:01] err shouldn't go to hell he says just a
[1:13:03] dead work you give baptize in the name
[1:13:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ and go to hell
[1:13:07] because there's just a dead work he said
[1:13:09] if it's not by faith out of your heart
[1:13:11] amen faith out of your soul looking for
[1:13:14] the resurrection in the rapture brother
[1:13:16] it won't be a reality to us on this a
[1:13:18] revelation coming out of the heart amen
[1:13:21] is a conviction in our hearts and in our
[1:13:23] souls concerning the resurrection
[1:13:25] anybody who that was convicted in
[1:13:27] justification others convicted in
[1:13:29] sanctification others and they give
[1:13:31] through the spirit and the bat and there
[1:13:33] was a conviction a man so the bride is
[1:13:35] convicted a man concerning what God
[1:13:37] wants to do he sends the word and by the
[1:13:40] Holy Ghost in that word he brings
[1:13:42] conviction in our hearts because he
[1:13:45] wants he wants us to to let him do what
[1:13:47] he wants to do in us and through us amen
[1:13:50] if not you oh you got it to decide one
[1:13:52] thing you decided to turn it over to God
[1:13:55] and you know they that lady and make the
[1:13:56] rest of the decisions anybody didn't you
[1:13:59] let God be the leader
[1:14:00] not you you're not gonna do what's right
[1:14:02] in your own eyes no no he said they do
[1:14:05] err in their heart and they have not
[1:14:07] known my ways the Bible said that they
[1:14:10] were doing what's right in their own
[1:14:11] eyes not going by the leadership of the
[1:14:15] Holy Ghost on to whom he said I swear in
[1:14:17] my wrath that they should not enter into
[1:14:21] my rest and brother they didn't enter
[1:14:25] into that rest in the promised land and
[1:14:26] there's many a believer today won't
[1:14:28] enter into God's rest in the Holy Ghost

[1:14:39] seated
[1:14:40] and turn with me to 1st Thessalonians
[1:14:43] chapter 5 first Thessalonians chapter 5
[1:14:53] so it's the Lord that has laid it on my
[1:14:55] heart to go back over some of these
[1:14:58] thoughts on hearing and seen a male and
[1:15:02] I personally feel that it's a revelation
[1:15:04] that the Lord wants us to confirm in our
[1:15:08] hearts a man God wants the confirmation
[1:15:11] of it in your soul a man not in your
[1:15:14] mind but in your soul
[1:15:16] so the grace of God to be in us and that
[1:15:20] we are experiencing God from the end
[1:15:21] side out a man and in verse chapter 5
[1:15:26] and verse 1 but of the times and seasons
[1:15:28] brethren you have no need that I write
[1:15:33] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[1:15:35] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:15:38] thief in the night for when they shall
[1:15:43] say peace and safety then sudden
[1:15:46] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:15:50] upon a woman with child and they shall
[1:15:52] not escape where by the grace of god
[1:15:56] were endeavoring by grace through faith
[1:15:57] to escape a man was coming the past in
[1:16:01] this world and what's going to happen on
[1:16:03] this earth that God had given us a
[1:16:05] promise that we're going to leave and go
[1:16:07] to be with him
[1:16:08] a man in the resurrection and in the
[1:16:11] rapture and it says be but ye brethren
[1:16:15] are not in darkness that that day should
[1:16:18] overtake you as a thief a man that we're
[1:16:23] not walking in darkness we're walking in
[1:16:24] the light and I'm not in our bodies but
[1:16:27] in our souls brothers got to go bad
[1:16:30] beyond the flesh and again go beyond
[1:16:32] your human spirit it's got to go into
[1:16:34] your soul some other than what the life
[1:16:37] that you're living is the life of Christ
[1:16:39] coming from the inside out and the power
[1:16:42] of God as I lighted it there are those
[1:16:45] who are putting the emphasis on the
[1:16:47] outside putting the emphasis on the
[1:16:49] flash putting the emphasis on the under
[1:16:51] you in spirit but not on the in their
[1:16:54] souls a man this is this is where we got
[1:16:57] to make sure that we believe the message
[1:16:59] is on the inside of the inside this is
[1:17:02] where we got to make sure that we are
[1:17:03] serving God is from the inside
[1:17:05] the insight a man not just the insight
[1:17:09] but the insight of the insight a man
[1:17:13] praise the name of what's inside it's
[1:17:16] the human spirit so you go beyond the
[1:17:17] human spirit inside that and this is
[1:17:20] where God is going to be working on your
[1:17:22] life God's going to work on my life
[1:17:23] where God is working in his in his
[1:17:26] children a man is where God is working
[1:17:28] in his sons and daughters
[1:17:30] and we think because they look like
[1:17:32] believers they're believers know God
[1:17:34] God not looking at the flesh oh yeah
[1:17:36] they they they learned their modestly
[1:17:37] dressed and and the brothers got the
[1:17:40] haircut and then the sisters got their
[1:17:41] long hair and they got dresses and so on
[1:17:44] knowing God looking at the heart a man
[1:17:46] whether it was causing him to leave
[1:17:48] lived like this what it's causing to act
[1:17:50] like this is there something in their
[1:17:51] souls those are just intellectual
[1:17:53] knowledge in their in their heads
[1:17:55] brothers see God as God is absolutely a
[1:17:58] man wants to deal with us in our souls
[1:18:01] amen
[1:18:03] so there's no interferes with the flesh
[1:18:04] and the senses of your flesh and there's
[1:18:07] no interference with the senses of your
[1:18:09] human spirit amen
[1:18:11] that we are totally absolutely under the
[1:18:14] under the control of paint amen it is
[1:18:18] that it is it is the revelation of what
[1:18:20] God wants us to see what God wants us to
[1:18:23] hear what God wants us to do amen
[1:18:25] what God wants to do by the grace of God
[1:18:28] in this hour
[1:18:29] amen revelation what God wanted to do in
[1:18:32] Luther and Wesley the Pentecostals what
[1:18:34] about you and me amen and brother is
[1:18:36] called beyond just the sisters going to
[1:18:38] dress like a like old-fashioned sisters
[1:18:40] or to act like act like they weren't a
[1:18:42] brothers just do this and do this ain't
[1:18:44] man butter it's that but beyond that God
[1:18:48] wants to but wants to fulfill the
[1:18:49] promise of the Resurrection and the
[1:18:52] rapture amen
[1:18:53] but he's getting us ready for the
[1:18:55] resurrection and the rapture brother so
[1:18:58] I hate getting us ready so that God can
[1:19:01] do what he wants God is going to say
[1:19:02] when he wants gotta get his believe what
[1:19:04] he wants us to believe a man God's going
[1:19:06] to get us the gold where he wants us to
[1:19:08] go hey man oh my brother sister let's be
[1:19:11] on our guard
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:14] and the scripture constantly is warning
[1:19:17] us to be on our guard
[1:19:18] a man anywhere it's the Old Testament
[1:19:21] whether it's the New Testament be on
[1:19:23] your guard
[1:19:24] this is what he said make your calling
[1:19:25] and election sure it's being on your
[1:19:27] guard a man because you don't want to be
[1:19:30] deceived and especially if there's ever
[1:19:33] an hour that we ought to be on our guard
[1:19:35] is this hour and is this age that we're
[1:19:37] living in because jesus warned us to be
[1:19:40] so deceiving it would to see the very
[1:19:42] elect if possible amen and if you see
[1:19:45] the very elect if possible the part of
[1:19:47] the guards that all mine he said just
[1:19:49] think and just consider it he said
[1:19:51] they're going to they're going to
[1:19:52] believe this we're going to believe this
[1:19:54] we're going to believe that now it's so
[1:19:55] close he said to what the bride is
[1:19:57] believing so close to what the true
[1:20:00] believers believing in their hearts and
[1:20:01] in their souls others are believed in
[1:20:03] and in their heads amen
[1:20:05] and then one is under the anointing of
[1:20:07] the devil the others under the anointing
[1:20:08] of God honey and only of our Lord Jesus
[1:20:10] Christ
[1:20:11] so he's warning and they might be in
[1:20:13] this message right here I have heard but
[1:20:15] now I see a man encouraging us to be on
[1:20:19] our guard encourage us to make our
[1:20:22] calling election sure making sure that
[1:20:24] we are under the right anointing any man
[1:20:27] neither the true anointing not the false
[1:20:29] anointing and again the old brothers
[1:20:31] sister go back read Malcolm at Matthew
[1:20:33] 24 and considered Lord I pray God Lord
[1:20:37] that I'm not going to be the seed Lord
[1:20:39] I'm not going to fall under the false
[1:20:41] spirit I'm going to be under the true
[1:20:42] and honey and the true spirit of the
[1:20:45] Holy Ghost but Lord you have warned us
[1:20:46] that it's going to be so close it would
[1:20:49] deceive the very elect impossible a man
[1:20:51] but the truth is it's going to be again
[1:20:55] it's going to be you know it so close to
[1:20:57] the real 99 that true is gonna be a
[1:21:00] hundred percent and the false is gonna
[1:21:03] be 99 percent or a hundred and one
[1:21:04] percent amen because the devil is going
[1:21:08] to maybe just take off the word and he
[1:21:10] always going to head on a few words amen
[1:21:12] you cannot head to it you can't take
[1:21:14] from it a man see there brother this is
[1:21:16] why that was the last exhortation that
[1:21:19] he gave in the scriptures he and the
[1:21:21] book of Revelation and it says if any
[1:21:25] man shall take away from the words of
[1:21:27] the
[1:21:28] of this prophecy God shall take away his
[1:21:30] part out of the book of life out of the
[1:21:33] holy city and from the things which are
[1:21:35] written therein and brother were also
[1:21:38] encouraged that we are not to head to it
[1:21:39] and we're not to think away from it amen
[1:21:42] but there are many that are the church
[1:21:44] to this present hour here in 2019 many a
[1:21:47] believer has headed to the message and
[1:21:50] they're continuing to add to the message
[1:21:52] and many a believer has taken away from
[1:21:54] the message a man they're taking away
[1:21:56] this for taking away their well weed I
[1:21:58] don't think God wants us to do this or
[1:22:00] God don't want us to do that come on
[1:22:02] brother I tell you God wants us to
[1:22:04] believe God wants to believe in our
[1:22:06] hearts where God God wants to give out
[1:22:08] and wants us to give him control of our
[1:22:11] lives

[1:29:10] reflecting that perfection not another
[1:29:13] thing what you can say but the life you
[1:29:15] can live any man and it is for the work
[1:29:19] of the ministry for the edifying of the

[1:29:25] and to encourage the body with the
[1:29:27] revelation that they need Amen as a

[1:29:50] but is it is it producing in us what God
[1:29:54] wants it to produce and it is the
[1:29:56] greater and greater resurrection and
[1:29:58] rapturing faith amen God is going to put
[1:30:01] the evidence on what he wants to do hey

[1:30:21] a day that he Whitney preached on John
[1:30:23] sanctification amen by the grace of God

[1:30:44] is working on in his bride amen
[1:30:47] the perfection that God is working on in
[1:30:49] your life and he might only play the
[1:30:51] grace of God amen and brother the more
[1:30:54] we get into it the more humble you
[1:30:55] become the more sincere you become a man
[1:30:58] and the more and more you're hungry or
[1:31:01] thirsty for the revelation that God's
[1:31:03] got in you any man but anything as I
[1:31:07] said we ought to hunger and thirst for
[1:31:08] this generation the previous generation
[1:31:11] as I said before no they didn't see what
[1:31:13] they didn't see in the messy what you
[1:31:15] and I are seeing all they saw was the
[1:31:17] profit all they saw was God sent a
[1:31:20] prophet a man know he do this but now
[1:31:23] you and I are seeing what he has done
[1:31:24] and why he has done it and God is
[1:31:27] working out in you and me why he's done
[1:31:29] it a man because God did that for this
[1:31:32] reason God did that for this purpose and
[1:31:35] what God did what he did in this this
[1:31:37] age is the accomplishing it in you and
[1:31:40] me now brother's been 50 over 50 years
[1:31:43] brother surely after 50 years there
[1:31:46] surely God is bringing us more and more
[1:31:48] closer to the resurrection the rapture
[1:31:50] reality a night the Bible says he dealt
[1:31:53] way he dealt with the with the
[1:31:54] Israelites there and those Jews he dealt
[1:31:57] with in 40 years in the wilderness a man
[1:32:00] and brother we have been we've been in
[1:32:02] this wilderness role over many many
[1:32:03] years
[1:32:04] I don't know whether it's going to be 50
[1:32:06] years 60 years 70 years amen
[1:32:09] but God God has got a purpose in it
[1:32:11] somewhere that we are still here and
[1:32:13] like I said I have seen some nights and
[1:32:15] I hear so much
[1:32:16] oh my apprai and I talked to the Lord
[1:32:20] when I'm walking when I'm driving
[1:32:21] sometimes the Lord have we missed it and
[1:32:23] we missed it Lord I trust we haven't
[1:32:25] missed the rapture Amen that's been my
[1:32:28] prayer that's been my crying calling on
[1:32:30] the Lord
[1:32:31] lord I trust we haven't missed it I pray
[1:32:34] God you're not going to mr. rapture and
[1:32:38] the only way we're not going to miss the
[1:32:40] rapture is to focus on the revelation
[1:32:42] the way that God wants us to focus on it
[1:32:44] that we got to hear it the way God wants
[1:32:47] us to hear and we'll see it the way God
[1:32:49] wants us to see it amen
[1:32:51] and I just focusing on the doctrine of
[1:32:53] the Godhead the god of water baptism or
[1:32:55] this doctrine or that after no our
[1:32:57] servants ain't no it's the doctrine now
[1:33:00] of the trick of the revelation of the
[1:33:02] Resurrection and the rapture anything
[1:33:04] God wants you to focus on that's what he
[1:33:06] wants you to focus on anything you want
[1:33:09] a hunger and thirst for that's it a man
[1:33:11] does not I want this and I want that no
[1:33:13] no no there's people that want God to do
[1:33:15] this why God to do that brother Issa
[1:33:17] what's your more than objective and
[1:33:19] again this is something I never never
[1:33:21] brought up but it's here in this message
[1:33:23] and he highlights and what is your
[1:33:25] motive and objective he said I I doesn't
[1:33:27] make a difference eaten if you're
[1:33:28] looking for healing he said why do you
[1:33:30] want to be healed hey Marion he said
[1:33:33] there are those that way you know they
[1:33:34] come to his ministry and all they wanted
[1:33:36] we little Brandon was his signs in his
[1:33:37] aim that end the determine that all they
[1:33:40] wanted was Healy he's a why do you want
[1:33:42] to be healed he said as of the will of
[1:33:45] God for you to be healed and he said he
[1:33:49] said or he said does God have another
[1:33:51] purpose so he said you got to want God's
[1:33:54] will
[1:33:54] hey you got to want to do God's purpose
[1:33:57] amen but no no we want God today so we
[1:34:00] want God to do this what I got to do
[1:34:01] that make everything good for us and
[1:34:03] always could be wonderful he said but he
[1:34:05] said is God you wouldn't go if I got in
[1:34:07] it or just get the glory unto yourself a
[1:34:10] man brother he's bringing it out I have
[1:34:13] heard but now I see
[1:34:14] have we heard by the way that we should
[1:34:15] have had ever heard it a man they didn't
[1:34:18] hear about healing the way they should
[1:34:19] have heard it they didn't hear about
[1:34:21] this and that I bet the way they should
[1:34:22] have heard it because they want it for
[1:34:24] their own benefit but not for the glory
[1:34:27] of God
[1:34:29] a man it's for the glory of God that we
[1:34:32] want healing is for the glory of God we
[1:34:34] want salvation we want to go we want God
[1:34:36] to glorify himself in you and in me by
[1:34:39] what he's going to do in you and in me a
[1:34:42] man not oh I'm a Christian so I don't
[1:34:45] have to work don't have to worry you
[1:34:47] better read the Bible a man the Bible
[1:34:51] tells us that we go we got to take these
[1:34:53] things and consider these things and be
[1:34:55] serious about these Saints amen
[1:34:57] by the grace of Almighty God but again
[1:35:00] there's so many ministries that lead the
[1:35:02] wrong impression with people today that
[1:35:04] you're all you got to do is this not you
[1:35:06] got to do it and God is gonna do all the
[1:35:07] rest no he's gonna you're gonna do it
[1:35:09] that's why the father God said God is
[1:35:11] waiting on you amen and the dating just
[1:35:15] straight brother sister what a
[1:35:17] responsibility that God's through the
[1:35:19] revelation of the word of this age has
[1:35:21] put on ours our hearts that God has put
[1:35:24] on our shoulders amen
[1:35:26] that the Danny Crace are waiting on me
[1:35:28] what are you waiting for the waiting
[1:35:31] with a resurrection and the risen and as
[1:35:33] Jesus said I am the resurrection rapture
[1:35:35] you are the resurrection rapture amen
[1:35:38] Crais make flesh in the brain no the
[1:35:41] noting though that any Christ are
[1:35:42] waiting on the brain because they're the
[1:35:44] ones that are going to bring them to
[1:35:45] resurrection into manifestation amen and
[1:35:48] the rapture to get cut off
[1:35:51] amen God is waiting on us but there's
[1:35:54] too many pretty early believers today
[1:35:56] just waiting on God God do this God do
[1:35:58] that God do something else brother
[1:36:00] sister what are you gonna do
[1:36:02] God gives us the revelation God gives us
[1:36:06] the alrighty guy gives up the power God
[1:36:08] gives us the strength amen to do what he
[1:36:11] wants us to do amen God will look at
[1:36:14] what God did when he said I've heard the
[1:36:15] cries of my people and I have come down
[1:36:17] to deliver them a man he did it he did
[1:36:21] did he deliver them or Moses did he
[1:36:25] deliver they were or Joshua and Caleb
[1:36:27] did he take him into the Promised Land
[1:36:29] or did Josh Michaela see right here God
[1:36:34] has set in the church for the perfecting
[1:36:37] of the Saints God has set among Israel
[1:36:40] for the perfecting of Israel
[1:36:42] ain't no the ministry that they are the
[1:36:44] recognized guardian Moses called in
[1:36:47] Joshua God in Cana and God in other said
[1:36:51] that we're willing to go into the
[1:36:53] Promised Land
[1:36:54] amen it's the same thing in this day of
[1:36:56] this hour is recognizing God in the
[1:36:58] ministry ministry to you and as laying
[1:37:01] God is raiding the responsibilities of
[1:37:02] the word in your lap anything that's why
[1:37:06] again the part of God day he felt so bad
[1:37:08] and of this and so bad he administered
[1:37:11] the administrative minister but he
[1:37:13] wasn't seeing much results from him the
[1:37:15] people weren't responding the way that
[1:37:16] the way that God should felt they should
[1:37:18] respond and he went to the Lord about it
[1:37:21] you know Lord all my lord is to me and
[1:37:23] maybe I haven't done it right maybe I
[1:37:25] haven't preached it enough and so on
[1:37:27] underfunding went out into the
[1:37:28] wilderness and I think it was the wind
[1:37:31] that blew he opened his Bible and the
[1:37:33] wind came and blew the leaves and it
[1:37:35] went right right right it right through
[1:37:37] that scripture and then it says just
[1:37:40] committed a little make your calling
[1:37:41] lecture abundantly leave it with the
[1:37:43] Lord
[1:37:43] amen and Joshua did it amen but you
[1:37:47] gotta leave it with God he said he said
[1:37:48] leave it in their lap a man and God
[1:37:52] confirmed it when he opened the Bible to
[1:37:54] that verse that right there that he
[1:37:56] wanted to come he said both now brother
[1:37:58] Brown that's what you got to do you got
[1:38:00] to leave it in their lap he said God
[1:38:02] left it in there Israel's lap now he
[1:38:05] said he said we're leaving it in the
[1:38:07] people's left the resurrection the
[1:38:09] rapture amen brother God gave the word
[1:38:12] God gave the revelation that would give
[1:38:14] us the faith so we're with that excuse
[1:38:17] amen so the private of God cannot be
[1:38:20] judged because all hi I didn't I didn't
[1:38:22] do this I didn't do that too old to help
[1:38:24] the people to come to resurrection wrap
[1:38:26] through faith he did all that what God
[1:38:28] want them to do
[1:38:29] he did everything that he had to do in
[1:38:31] this hour to give it to give us
[1:38:33] resurrection right through faith we are
[1:38:35] without excuse
[1:38:37] old brother sister don't blame God don't
[1:38:40] blame women Bram you can't blame the
[1:38:42] ministry 50 years ago or 40 years ago

[1:38:48] been giving us more and more revelation
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:52] to give us the greater and greater faith
[1:38:54] brother/sister the yeah the faith for
[1:38:58] justification he did it was faith God

[1:39:03] revelation of the letter to to the to -

[1:44:47] tremendous the purpose of the word the
[1:44:50] Ministry of the word
[1:44:52] God has said in Israel the ministry God
[1:44:55] has said in the Church of Pikeville
[1:44:57] ministry and there's many today don't
[1:44:59] believe in the ministry this is amazing
[1:45:03] we're gonna need it right on through the
[1:45:05] probably God said he said you know me
[1:45:06] that he said even the ministry here it's
[1:45:09] gonna be leaders there I said you think

[1:45:30] hope maybe I don't make it but I'll tell
[1:45:35] you this when we get there brother I
[1:45:36] tell you we're not gonna be conscious of
[1:45:38] time no way and no matter how hard that
[1:45:42] Minister was preaching to you you won't
[1:45:44] even know it amen you won't be conscious
[1:45:47] of it you didn't wanna think about it by
[1:45:49] the grace of God amen that's why again
[1:45:52] I'm a trying day I was a ranger certain
[1:45:54] ones concerning you over the dead and
[1:45:56] where they're going and they use that
[1:45:57] scripture out of context that dead know
[1:46:00] not anything amen it sits right there in
[1:46:05] the Old Testament and they use that and
[1:46:07] say all so and they teach it as a
[1:46:10] doctrine they dead don't know anything
[1:46:12] but I said go and put it back in its
[1:46:14] context and read it all I said they
[1:46:16] don't know anything other days like I
[1:46:18] said but they're very conscious of the
[1:46:20] of where they're gone amen because the
[1:46:23] rich man lifted up his eyes and helped
[1:46:24] being in torment and the only that he
[1:46:26] was seeing her CDs hello cold warning my
[1:46:28] brother's cool warned this one he said
[1:46:30] no they already had the word amen
[1:46:33] well but Lazarus lifted up his ice in
[1:46:35] the bosom of Abraham peace rest amen
[1:46:40] so brother sister the prophet of God did
[1:46:42] remind us that he's heard the ministry
[1:46:44] here is gonna be ministry there oh yeah
[1:46:48] because again there's just going to be
[1:46:51] those that there were those that walked
[1:46:52] up and down in the coals of fire even
[1:46:54] Satan in his Minister here he had a
[1:46:58] ministry there are you in heaven
[1:47:03] terney yeah and he got lifted up with
[1:47:06] pride oh yeah and he brought and it this
[1:47:10] is what this is what brought world in
[1:47:12] this condition right now God permitted
[1:47:13] it to reveal this and express his love
[1:47:16] and now a that to get love from you hey
[1:47:21] God once now not love you love him
[1:47:24] because you got to know love it because
[1:47:27] you want to any man when you consider
[1:47:31] the revelation of God you consider the
[1:47:33] nature of God you consider what God
[1:47:35] permitted and what God did and what God
[1:47:37] is doing and consider what where we were
[1:47:40] born
[1:47:40] thank you Jesus I don't deserve this I
[1:47:44] was born in sin shape that iniquity come
[1:47:47] to the world speaking lies Lord but look
[1:47:50] what you did look what you did to Adam
[1:47:53] and me look what you did to Abel look
[1:47:55] what you did even love brother God said
[1:47:58] to Cain if thou doest well want them
[1:48:00] also be accepted that was divine law hey
[1:48:05] man
[1:48:06] brother what would we do Oh King he
[1:48:10] murdered his brother get out of here
[1:48:13] yeah back to him
[1:48:15] get out of here oh yeah that's why that
[1:48:18] many would believe did it do the day
[1:48:20] because they believe is problem somebody
[1:48:22] kills somebody you can't you could take
[1:48:23] them and in a court and sentence them to
[1:48:25] death
[1:48:26] no you can't no no that's contrary to
[1:48:29] the word but there's many that would do
[1:48:32] that back there cuz they would have
[1:48:34] Cain's spirit they want to kill Cain
[1:48:37] yeah because he killed Abel brother
[1:48:40] God says came if you do well won't you
[1:48:43] also be accepted Amen brothers sister
[1:48:48] let let God deal with you in your heart
[1:48:50] and in your soul there's too many
[1:48:52] believers brother they're taking the
[1:48:54] word but they're not letting God deal
[1:48:56] with them through the word God got to
[1:48:59] deal with you brother to bring you to
[1:49:01] that place that did you please God and
[1:49:03] you love God God's gonna deal with you
[1:49:06] and the problem of God in this message
[1:49:08] right here on I have heard but now I see
[1:49:12] probably God brings it out God dealing
[1:49:15] with us
[1:49:15] reason a man and he on it--so again joke
[1:49:19] God dealt with Joel for a reason
[1:49:22] he wasn't punishing job he was purging
[1:49:25] job a man and brother is not God
[1:49:28] punishing yellow party she may is God
[1:49:31] purging you
[1:49:32] oh no no no Jesus perched me he's dead
[1:49:35] did it all oh no

[2:06:17] whether we wake or sleep we should live
[2:06:21] together with him share his life that's
[2:06:27] what it means share is life just think
[2:06:30] Jesus not dead he's here oh oh he came
[2:06:37] from India he came from the Congo yeah
[2:06:43] oh he came from the States
[2:06:46] yeah so he could fellowship with his
[2:06:50] brothers and sisters praise the name of
[2:06:53] the Lord
[2:06:54] Alleluia praise the name of the Lord see
[2:06:57] we share his life we're sharing the life

[2:07:06] States and all over the world by the
[2:07:08] grace of Almighty God so he said whether
[2:07:15] we wake or sleep we should live together
[2:07:18] with him share his life whether we're
[2:07:21] for comfort yourselves together and
[2:07:23] edify one another even as also ye do
[2:07:28] amen brother that do bring it to a
[2:07:36] conclusion right I thought I would just
[2:07:39] read scripture and go right on into the
[2:07:41] message but I've been in the message oh
[2:07:45] yeah
[2:07:46] quoting the message highlighting this
[2:07:49] not only that I lollie I like more as we
[2:07:53] go along because it's amazing what he's
[2:07:56] bringing out but it's a reason because
[2:07:58] he knew he was going because when he
[2:08:01] reached fifty-six years always today
[2:08:04] I see my incoming at 56 years old and
[2:08:11] this message that he preached on I have
[2:08:13] heard but now I see he preached that in
[2:08:16] Shreveport by the Jack Morris Church and
[2:08:19] in one of our books up there is a gene
[2:08:23] more by the Jack Moore's daughter her
[2:08:26] testimony is there and what she's
[2:08:28] experienced with the Prophet and God had
[2:08:33] ordained brother Jack more and it's a 70
[2:08:37] to be there in Shreveport Louisiana what
[2:08:43] for for the Ministry of the word because
[2:08:46] he respected brother Branham and he
[2:08:48] honored brother Branham and brother
[2:08:50] Brown was free to preach what he wanted
[2:08:54] in brother Jack Morris Church oh yes and
[2:08:59] this is in 1965 and brother Branham went
[2:09:06] from Tucson to Shreveport Louisiana and
[2:09:09] he preached in Tucson he preached what
[2:09:14] else would you build me and then he went
[2:09:19] to Shreveport and he preached the
[2:09:23] invisible union of the Bride of Christ
[2:09:27] yeah
[2:09:29] revelations that we needed before he
[2:09:33] left he preached one message one time
[2:09:37] and maybe others and he said he said
[2:09:40] this is another revelation of the seven
[2:09:43] seals I believe that some of these
[2:09:46] messages are the results of the opening
[2:09:49] of the seven seals its mysteries that
[2:09:52] God wanted us to see a man his mysteries
[2:09:57] that God wanted us to hear a man to give
[2:10:00] us the faith that pleases they pleased
[2:10:02] him do you have the faith that pleases
[2:10:05] God today
[2:10:08] amen I told you your faith won't be
[2:10:11] selfish no no you it's not Lord do this
[2:10:15] for me for me no Lord not my will don't
[2:10:18] be done that's the faith that pleases
[2:10:21] God amen
[2:10:23] it's easily its leadership not your
[2:10:26] leadership and he preached invisible
[2:10:29] union of the bride he preached works is
[2:10:32] faith expressed he preached trying to do
[2:10:38] God a service without it being God's
[2:10:40] will and many tried to do that today
[2:10:44] gotta be the will of God he preached
[2:10:48] this message here I have heard but now I
[2:10:52] see amen and he continued on in
[2:10:57] shreveport and he preached God's only
[2:11:01] provided place of worship in Christ in
[2:11:08] the revealed Word and then he preached
[2:11:11] and concluded his report series on the
[2:11:16] wings of us no wait though Amen I
[2:11:20] believe this was the leadership of the
[2:11:23] Holy Ghost ministering to the bride
[2:11:25] before taking the profit off the scene a
[2:11:28] man and then he went on to other places
[2:11:32] in California but in Tucson yes and the
[2:11:40] last message he preached in California
[2:11:41] was leadership and the last message he
[2:11:44] preached before God took him home was
[2:11:47] communion a man why because all that God
[2:11:57] did all that God was doing and all that
[2:12:00] God is doing is to bring us more and
[2:12:04] more into communion with him hallelujah
[2:12:09] praise the name of the Lord oh he was
[2:12:13] highlighting natural communion but yes
[2:12:16] spiritual as well
[2:12:20] that we is in vain to take that if we
[2:12:23] don't have a communion with him it's all
[2:12:27] in vain in vain do you worship Me
[2:12:30] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[2:12:32] of men and so on so brother he preached
[2:12:35] communion he highlighted communion the
[2:12:37] significance of communion when he was in
[2:12:40] Tucson
[2:12:40] he wasn't pretty preaching Diaz asked
[2:12:42] him to get up and speak they exhort the
[2:12:45] people before they went into communion
[2:12:46] and this is what he did in the communion
[2:12:49] and at that same service he a man
[2:12:53] he prayed for brother green laid hands
[2:12:55] on him I pray God bless his ministry and
[2:12:58] so on but brother sister let's consider
[2:13:04] in our souls whether or not God has
[2:13:06] brought us into communion with him amen
[2:13:10] not just bread and wine but the reveal
[2:13:13] word by the grace of God amen
[2:13:17] so god help us brother that we're gonna
[2:13:20] recognize the significance of what God
[2:13:22] has done and what God is doing and let's
[2:13:25] consider Grady's after the questions do
[2:13:29] we have this revelation in our hearts of
[2:13:31] what God has done and what God is doing
[2:13:34] do we truly hear and see the Word of God
[2:13:37] the way that God wants us to hear it
[2:13:40] anyway the way God wants us to see it
[2:13:43] not in your head but in your soul a man
[2:13:52] he said just watch this was 1965 in
[2:13:56] August he said watch stay close to
[2:14:01] Christ he said let me warn you now as a
[2:14:06] minister of the gospel of this don't
[2:14:10] take any foolishness don't imagine
[2:14:13] anything stay right there
[2:14:17] until this inside of the inside is
[2:14:20] anchored to the word Amen that your soul
[2:14:25] is anchored to the word eat so that you
[2:14:29] are right in Christ because that's the
[2:14:32] the only thing that's going because we
[2:14:35] are in the most deceiving age that we
[2:14:38] ever did maybe that's why the Lord want
[2:14:43] me to come back and go through this
[2:14:45] these things there again in that message
[2:14:46] I have heard but now I see he said clean
[2:14:53] up your lives pay your debts Jesus said
[2:14:58] oh no man now he said he didn't mean
[2:15:03] like your rent I was renting and stuff
[2:15:05] like that he's you got to do it but he
[2:15:08] said get all your things off your hands
[2:15:10] and get everything right make ready get
[2:15:12] ready remember in the name of the Lord
[2:15:15] something is fixing to happen he was
[2:15:19] going but there was going to be a
[2:15:23] challenge to the bride and it's been a
[2:15:25] tremendous challenge since they're going
[2:15:27] to the Prophet
[2:15:28] amen he said that a little inside of the
[2:15:34] inside he said that's where you start he
[2:15:37] said which is your soul you don't start
[2:15:40] in your head start in your soul he's our
[2:15:44] the inside of the inside the control
[2:15:46] tower
[2:15:47] and he said it's either controlled by
[2:15:50] God or Satan so make sure your control
[2:15:56] tower today it's controlled by God a man
[2:16:03] he said when it's directed from the
[2:16:06] inside it throws all the rest of it
[2:16:08] together
[2:16:09] he said that's the guidepost that's the
[2:16:12] control tower the inside of the inside
[2:16:15] and he said the soul controls the spirit
[2:16:18] and the spirit controls the body amen so
[2:16:24] God through the baptism of the Holy
[2:16:28] Ghost through the rebirth in your soul
[2:16:31] controls your human spirit and the human
[2:16:33] spirit under the God's control controls
[2:16:36] the body make sure that he's in control
[2:16:41] of your soul amen
[2:16:43] make sure that he's
[2:16:45] absolute control of your soul so that
[2:16:47] he's controlling your human spirit and
[2:16:49] controlling your body god help us Aaron
[2:16:58] is one thing seen is another especially
[2:17:03] in the age wherein the false anointing
[2:17:05] is so close to the true anointing that
[2:17:08] it would deceive the very elect if
[2:17:10] possible just think of that that's the
[2:17:12] challenge you top it keep your eye on
[2:17:14] your garden on your toes that that
[2:17:17] prophecy ought to do that the false
[2:17:22] anointing is so close to the true
[2:17:25] anointing that it would deceive the very
[2:17:27] elect if possible dad oh brother you
[2:17:31] better make sure it's god that's think
[2:17:34] there's role of your life yeah it is
[2:17:39] absolutely necessary to make your
[2:17:42] calling an election sure make sure
[2:17:44] you're under the true anointing and not
[2:17:47] the false on ID are you hearing and
[2:17:51] seeing the message the way that God
[2:17:54] wants you to hear it the way that God
[2:17:56] wants you to see it brothers sister is
[2:17:58] it controlling your life the way God
[2:18:01] wants it to control and govern you and

[2:18:10] is not controlling them no oh they say I
[2:18:14] believe this I believe this I believe
[2:18:16] that but brother is God in control
[2:18:18] because the devil also believes it amen
