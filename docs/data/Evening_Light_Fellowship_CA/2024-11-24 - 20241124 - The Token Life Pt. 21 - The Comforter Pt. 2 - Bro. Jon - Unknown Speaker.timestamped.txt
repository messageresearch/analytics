[40:05] very much bothering me the swelling's
[40:07] down a bit this morning but the

[40:10] struggling to see out of that left eye
[40:12] but uh we'll trust the Lord to get us
[40:13] through this morning if I have to do
[40:14] this then we'll do this so amen God
[40:17] bless you John chapter 14 Jesus speaking
[40:19] here says but the comforter which is the
[40:22] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[40:24] my name he shall teach you all things
[40:26] and bring all all things to your
[40:28] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[40:31] you amen God bless you you can have your
[40:32] seats this morning amen we're continuing
[40:34] our series we've been preaching on the
[40:36] Holy Ghost called the token life and I
[40:38] want to take a second thought on the
[40:40] comforter this morning and on Wednesday
[40:42] we started this little thought on the
[40:43] comforter and we talked about how a
[40:45] comforter is needed in the times of
[40:47] hardship he's needed in the times of
[40:48] trial of pain and suffering amen we
[40:50] don't need a comforter when the days are
[40:52] sunny when there's money in the bank
[40:54] when our health is good when our
[40:55] relationships are good when church is
[40:57] great when everything's going our way
[40:59] that's not when we need a comforter we
[41:00] need a comforter for when things are
[41:03] difficult amen and that's why the
[41:04] comforter came was to bring them through
[41:06] a difficult time and we told how Jesus
[41:08] said that the to the disciples he says
[41:11] hard times are coming hard times are
[41:13] coming it's going to seem like
[41:14] everything's Fallen apart like
[41:15] everything you believe for everything
[41:16] you trusted in has gone a different way
[41:20] amen but that Spirit of Truth in Christ
[41:21] had to tell them the full picture amen
[41:24] we'll find that in the word that God
[41:25] doesn't just tell us all of the good
[41:26] things tells us the hard things as well
[41:28] but he says I'll take you through those
[41:30] from start to finish amen amen so God
[41:33] doesn't hold back from us God doesn't
[41:36] hold back from us God lets us know hey
[41:37] things are coming your way you're going
[41:39] to deal with persecutions you're going
[41:40] to deal with hardships you're going to
[41:42] deal with trials amen the spirit of
[41:44] Christ in you is against what the world
[41:45] has and so they're trying to destroy
[41:47] what it is that you have in you and
[41:48] they're trying to pull you away from
[41:50] those things amen but we're meant to
[41:52] produce the word that's what we're meant
[41:54] to do is produce the word in our age and
[41:56] our season and that means that
[41:57] everything in this world is against us
[41:59] and it's not against us as people it's
[42:01] against the word that's living within us
[42:03] amen don't take it personally when you
[42:05] get judged when people say things about
[42:07] you when things go a certain way because
[42:09] of the way you live or the way you dress
[42:11] or the way you speak the the Christian
[42:13] Life that we have because the world is
[42:15] trying to beat that out of us amen it's
[42:17] trying to destroy us it's trying to make
[42:19] us bow down to it rather than us as the
[42:21] three Hebrew children stand up and say
[42:23] it doesn't matter what you do we will
[42:25] not bow amen it'll take us and we see
[42:27] what this world is trying to do it's
[42:29] trying to beat down our mind and and get
[42:31] us into a place of Mind Games where we
[42:33] can think a thought that's contrary to
[42:35] the word of God like Satan did with Eve
[42:37] in the beginning to just get that one
[42:39] thought that's contrary and in that they
[42:41] drive a wedge between us and the word
[42:42] and they got a place now that they can
[42:44] start to work with us tries to beat us
[42:47] down in our bodies with stress and
[42:49] work doesn't it it the world is we
[42:52] talked about this before that it's
[42:54] making us build bricks without straw and
[42:56] it all seems like everything that we do
[42:58] is focused on trying to make a living
[43:00] and so circumstances rise up and stress
[43:03] draws us away from the things of God and
[43:04] we've got to push back against that and
[43:06] say he is Jehovah Gyra he's my provider
[43:09] I can't be all on me I'm going to trust
[43:11] him and I'm going to do what is meant
[43:13] for the kingdom of God Amen it tries to
[43:15] take away our work life balance so that
[43:17] we give up the things of God so that we
[43:19] can have the things that are needful to
[43:21] us but Jesus said seek ye first the
[43:23] kingdom of God seek ye first what he has
[43:25] for you and then he'll add all all of
[43:27] these things to you amen that's a
[43:29] promise that we have that's one thing I
[43:30] love about the word is that when you go
[43:32] through hard times you have a promise
[43:34] that is waiting for you that is at the
[43:36] end of it all amen but we have to go
[43:38] through those things we need the
[43:39] comforter and he's there to lead us he's
[43:41] there to guide us he's there to remind
[43:44] us and teach us by the word of God what
[43:46] it takes to go through life amen the
[43:48] Holy Ghost is what make the is what
[43:50] makes that word live remember what Jesus
[43:51] said he said my words they are spirit
[43:54] and they are life amen it's not just
[43:56] words written on the pages of a book but
[43:58] the the word is the very essence the
[44:00] very nature the very life of God and
[44:03] it's meant to come and live in human
[44:04] flesh today amen but I want to take
[44:07] another angle on what we preached on
[44:09] Wednesday on the comforter because we
[44:11] know we can find comfort in many things
[44:13] and we spoke even a little bit on this
[44:14] on Wednesday how we can rest in our
[44:16] finances if we have a lot of money in
[44:18] the bank we can rest in our job and our
[44:20] degree or our skill if we have a lot of
[44:23] those things amen we can rest in our
[44:24] health and our strength but there's
[44:26] coming a day where that's going to fade
[44:28] away in some form or fashion I think we
[44:30] can all say we've gone through financial
[44:32] difficulties at times we've gone through
[44:34] health issues I mean I told the brothers
[44:35] I said I'm never preaching on the
[44:37] comforter again because as soon as I
[44:38] preach it I get
[44:39] sick but guess what here I am again
[44:42] today preaching on the comforter why cuz
[44:44] he's a comfort in a time of trial he's a
[44:46] comfort in a time of difficulty and one
[44:48] thing's for sure I'm not going to let
[44:50] the the trials of this life keep me from
[44:52] doing what God has called me to do even
[44:54] if it can only see out of one eye the
[44:56] Lord gives the Lord takes away I'm going
[44:58] to stand in my post and in my duty and
[45:00] in my position amen but I believe I'm
[45:03] speaking to Believers here today and we
[45:05] ought to know where we find our comfort
[45:08] but the problem is sometimes in our
[45:09] spirituality we can put our comfort in
[45:12] things that are of God but yet they are
[45:14] not God Amen if we can get into that a
[45:17] little bit this morning amen I want to
[45:19] focus there in this service because what
[45:21] we can end up is we can focus on the
[45:23] things he gives rather than the things
[45:25] he is if I could put it that way and
[45:27] I've been reading a lot in the Book of
[45:29] John in this study on the Holy Ghost
[45:31] because as I've said before John has a
[45:33] very deep understanding of of the
[45:35] reality and the revelation of Jesus
[45:37] Christ because he didn't start with
[45:39] Jesus in a manger John took us all the
[45:42] way back to in the beginning was the
[45:44] word and he showed us Christ from the
[45:46] beginning he showed us the first
[45:48] creative act of God he showed us the
[45:49] pillar of fire The Dwelling Place of God
[45:51] and then he brought it all the way to
[45:53] 2,000 years and he said that word was
[45:55] made flesh and dwelt among yes amen but
[45:58] the thing is so often the problem is
[45:59] that we can see Christ from Genesis to
[46:02] Revelation but if we can see him then we
[46:04] ought to be able to see ourselves
[46:06] because we were in him in the beginning
[46:08] amen if he he was there then we ought to
[46:10] see ourselves there amen because you
[46:13] can't be a part of him today if you
[46:14] weren't a part of him back in the
[46:16] beginning amen Eve came out of Adam the
[46:18] bride comes out of Christ we are not
[46:21] something that is new or created but we
[46:23] are something that is drawn out of the
[46:25] very essence and personality in the the
[46:27] nature of God Amen so we're not saved
[46:30] this morning by Creed or by baptism or
[46:32] by Church affiliation or by Doctrine
[46:34] amen but we're saved by the receiving of
[46:36] the eternal life that we had in him
[46:39] before the foundation of the world water
[46:42] baptism doesn't save me the church
[46:44] doctrine doesn't save me amen but when I
[46:46] receive eternal life it makes me a new
[46:48] creation it changes me into what I was
[46:51] in him before the foundation of the
[46:53] world Amen our first birth was in sin we
[46:56] come to the world in sin shaped in
[46:57] iniquity the scripture says but it's by
[47:00] the Regeneration of this life that we
[47:02] receive the Holy Spirit and we receive
[47:05] the new birth amen we surrender our
[47:07] bodies we submit it to the word of God
[47:09] by the holy spirit amen and that is the
[47:12] new birth amen we're saved by receiving
[47:14] New Life by eternal life of the Holy
[47:17] Spirit we are not saved by what we're
[47:18] gathered here doing today amen otherwise
[47:21] what we're doing is we're washing an old
[47:23] life amen rather than being born again
[47:26] into new life that old man has died Paul
[47:28] said it's supposed to be dead so we
[47:30] don't want to be washing an old life
[47:31] with the word amen we want to have a new
[47:33] life by the holy spirit amen but
[47:36] remember what we said last service in
[47:37] the scriptures in John 16 Jesus speaking
[47:40] about the Holy Ghost coming and he says
[47:42] these things have I spoken unto you that
[47:45] what in me ye might have peace in the
[47:48] world he says in the world sorry in me
[47:50] you might have peace in the world you
[47:52] shall have tribulation but be of good
[47:55] cheer I have overcome the world so our
[47:58] peace is not in in the circumstances
[48:01] amen good or bad there's tribulation
[48:03] there the wages of sin is death
[48:05] everything that this world is producing
[48:07] is death to us but our peace is in
[48:11] Christ Our rest is in Christ our joy is
[48:13] in Christ Our satisfying portion is in
[48:16] Christ everything we have need of is in
[48:19] Christ this morning and he says it's in
[48:21] me you're going to find peace even while
[48:23] you're in Tribulation in the midst of
[48:25] this world listen to this quote he says
[48:28] it doesn't lay in the individual I read
[48:30] this a couple Services ago it doesn't
[48:33] lay in you it doesn't lay in me I don't
[48:35] care how good a Christian we are this
[48:37] morning he says it lays in God it
[48:42] doesn't lay within you today it lays
[48:44] within God that's in you the faith that
[48:46] you have in God it doesn't lay within me
[48:49] today it lays within God so if God has
[48:52] raised from the dead and all that God
[48:54] was he poured into Christ and all that
[48:56] Christ was he poured into the church he
[48:58] says I'll be with you he says I've tried
[49:01] across the world to Proclaim that Jesus
[49:04] Christ lives he is not dead he's just as
[49:07] real today as he was in the days he
[49:09] walked in Galilee but the unbelieving
[49:12] world has condemned it because they're
[49:14] carnal and can't understand the
[49:16] spiritual things because he said they
[49:18] wouldn't then he quotes scripture a
[49:19] little while in the world sees me no
[49:21] more yet ye shall see me for I'll be
[49:24] with you and if he is in here and with
[49:27] us then it's God and not us the faith
[49:31] that you have in him is God the works
[49:33] that he would do here with him would be
[49:36] him and not us amen so I said that our
[49:39] comfort it can be in so many things and
[49:42] the more spiritually minded we get
[49:44] sometimes the more we misplace our
[49:47] Comforts because Satan's trying to get
[49:49] us to rest on anything but the sure
[49:51] foundation and so he'll focus our
[49:53] attentions on different things and we
[49:55] can Garner comfort from things that I'm
[49:57] not saying they're not of God and
[49:58] they're not good because they very well
[50:01] well may be but we have to be careful
[50:03] where our resting place is and where we
[50:05] are truly in our comfort amen when Jesus
[50:08] came to the River Jordan and he was
[50:10] filled with the Holy Ghost he was at
[50:12] that moment the fullness of God in flesh
[50:14] he was God incarnate all that God was
[50:17] was in Christ amen that was in a perfect
[50:20] body spoken into existence by the Holy
[50:23] Spirit Mary had nothing to do with it
[50:25] she was not his mother she was just an
[50:27] incubator Jesus never called her mother
[50:30] he called her woman there was nothing of
[50:32] Mary in Jesus Mary had to go into the
[50:35] upper room on the day of Pentecost and
[50:37] get the Holy Ghost just like the rest of
[50:38] us she has no capabilities she has no
[50:41] intercessory Powers she is the same as
[50:44] you and I amen she needed the Holy Ghost
[50:46] she needed a new birth just as you and I
[50:49] were amen but remember when Christ came
[50:52] and died the purpose of that was not
[50:54] just to restore relationship to God
[50:57] that was part and parcel of it but the
[50:59] purpose of God is to restore us back to
[51:02] our eating condition to where we are in
[51:04] full relationship with God and we have
[51:07] full Dominion on the earth God's looking
[51:11] back for a a return to the family of God
[51:14] in the place that God built for us amen
[51:16] so Christ had to die for our sins and
[51:19] yes that was to open the door back to
[51:21] the presence of God but we can see that
[51:24] there were many great things that God
[51:26] gave before Christ ever died we can see
[51:29] great Ministries we can see great gifts
[51:31] we can see men and women with wonderful
[51:34] works and signs and wonders and Power in
[51:36] their life we can look at Samson who did
[51:39] great Feats of Strength we can look at
[51:41] Moses who parted the sea that touched
[51:43] things and they split open that spoke
[51:45] the word whatever it was we saw these
[51:48] great gifts we see that David could have
[51:50] great victories we could have Joshua who
[51:52] could command the Sun and the Moon to
[51:54] stand still all these wonderful things
[51:58] and even in Jesus day we see that his
[52:00] disciples had great works and great
[52:02] Ministries even before he died at
[52:05] Calvary even before the Holy Ghost was
[52:07] given and I want to spend some time
[52:09] there this morning to talk about this
[52:11] because he says in Matthew 10 and when
[52:13] he had called unto him his 12 disciples
[52:15] he gave them power against unclean
[52:18] spirits to cast them out and to heal all
[52:20] manner of dis of sickness and all manner
[52:23] of disease jumping to verse 7 he says as
[52:26] you go preach saying the Kingdom of
[52:29] Heaven is at hand so he gave them power
[52:31] he gave them Authority he gave them
[52:32] signs and wonders and he gave them the
[52:35] word amen he gave them all of those
[52:37] things and here's his his commission he
[52:39] says heal the sick cleanse the lepers
[52:41] raise the Dead cast out Devils freely ye
[52:44] have received freely give we don't
[52:47] charge money for the gospel I was
[52:49] watching a a minister in Nairobi or in
[52:52] in
[52:54] um Nigeria
[52:57] and he was saying I want you to give a
[52:59] thousand naira for every year that
[53:01] you've had in your life on this Earth
[53:04] what is that have to do with the gospel
[53:06] Jesus said freely you have received
[53:08] freely give if somebody wants something
[53:10] that we have that God has given us then
[53:12] we give it to them freely no charge amen
[53:15] that's just what we do that's our
[53:16] Christian obligation is to share as we
[53:18] he has shared and to give as he has
[53:21] given with us amen we do not ever charge
[53:23] anybody people can come in and they can
[53:25] hear the gospel for free they can come
[53:26] for pastoral counseling for free we can
[53:29] go help them move their house for free
[53:31] it matters not we're here to serve he
[53:33] gives us strength he gives us gifts he
[53:35] gives us Ministries to serve amen that's
[53:37] the purpose of these things but I want
[53:39] to stop and dwell on this for a second
[53:41] here because we're talking about the
[53:42] comforter today and we have to be
[53:44] careful where we put that Comfort
[53:46] because if our comfort is not in the
[53:48] person of the word rather than in the
[53:50] gifts of the word then we're going to
[53:51] get into trouble very quickly in this
[53:54] scripture Jesus sends out how many
[53:56] disciples
[53:58] 12 now if you look in the original 12
[54:01] that means that Judas was a part of this
[54:04] group Judas was the tra betrayer of
[54:08] Jesus Jesus or Judas is listed as the
[54:11] son of
[54:12] ption Jes Judas it says that Satan
[54:16] indwelt him on the night of the LA of
[54:18] the Passover Judas was for a Time the
[54:22] dwelling place of Satan on this Earth
[54:24] and yet Judas Ministry included signs
[54:28] and wonders and healing and casting out
[54:31] demons and raising the
[54:35] dead that that that blows our mind I
[54:38] think because you say how can that be
[54:41] and yet the scripture clearly says that
[54:43] that's the way it it was stop and
[54:45] consider the great Ministries that went
[54:47] out from under Jesus amen if we went out
[54:50] through all of Newan land now if Jesus
[54:52] was here and he commissioned us to do
[54:54] that and he sent all the brothers out to
[54:56] do do that what would happen there'd be
[54:58] this great uproar throughout New Finland
[55:00] and we would have to buy or build
[55:02] another church because thousands would
[55:04] come in to see these great Ministries
[55:06] and to be with these Great Men that's
[55:09] what would happen and we see that that's
[55:10] what happened with Jesus is that he had
[55:12] thousands upon thousands of people
[55:14] around him amen and they were there for
[55:16] the signs and wonders and yes for a
[55:18] while they were even there for his
[55:20] ministry of the
[55:21] word but look at the men that were there
[55:24] those 11 men we would say they were real
[55:26] Believers Judas was a traitor Judas was
[55:28] a son of predition but these were the
[55:30] other 11 were real sons of God Amen they
[55:33] were real men of the ministry amen and
[55:36] they were doing the very works that
[55:37] Jesus was doing and by that I mean they
[55:39] were doing signs and wonders they were
[55:41] doing healing they were casting out
[55:42] demons they were raising the dead but we
[55:45] look at what Jesus uh conversation with
[55:48] Peter and his description with Peter not
[55:50] too long after this and Peter had a
[55:52] great ministry he had great Passion he
[55:54] had great Authority amongst the
[55:55] disciples
[55:57] but this is what Jesus says about him
[55:59] while he has done these things he says
[56:02] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[56:04] faith fail not and when thou art
[56:07] converted strengthen thy Brethren so
[56:09] Peter has this wonderful Ministry with
[56:12] the rest of the disciples amen and Peter
[56:15] wasn't even
[56:17] converted Peter had not received the
[56:20] kingdom of God Peter had not received
[56:22] the Holy Ghost amen Peter was preaching
[56:24] the kingdom of God is coming and he had
[56:28] signs and wonders following him today
[56:31] we'd say coming it's here the the
[56:34] kingdom of God is here look at this this
[56:36] sister got healed that brother was
[56:38] raised from the dead this one's been
[56:40] delivered from a demon what do you mean
[56:41] the kingdom of God is coming the kingdom
[56:44] of God is
[56:45] here but Jesus said go say it's coming
[56:49] but if you're following the signs and
[56:51] wonders then you'd say it's already here
[56:54] but that's not the proof of it amen
[56:56] these were temporary fixes people that
[56:58] were healed got sick again people that
[57:00] were raised from the dead they died
[57:02] again maybe people that got delivered
[57:04] from demon possession went back and got
[57:06] it again because it came back a while
[57:07] later and found it all cleaned up but
[57:09] not filled with something else that's
[57:11] what the scripture says and they went
[57:12] right back to their original condition
[57:14] it was a temporary fix amen it didn't
[57:17] last so it could not be the kingdom of
[57:19] God because the kingdom of God has no
[57:22] End Amen but Jesus said you're not
[57:25] converted the Kingdom of Heaven is not
[57:27] here he told Nicodemus he said the
[57:30] kingdom he says except a man be born
[57:32] again he cannot see he cannot understand
[57:35] the kingdom of God because it is not
[57:38] something that is seen physically but
[57:40] rather it is a personal experience that
[57:42] changes your life that is what the
[57:44] kingdom of God is remember what Jesus
[57:46] said in Luke 17 it says and when he was
[57:49] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[57:51] kingdom of God should come see they
[57:53] thought it was going to be the return of
[57:55] Israel and and the freeing of them from
[57:57] their captors and their bondage and
[57:59] these different things it says he
[58:01] answered them and said the kingdom of
[58:04] God cometh not with observation in other
[58:06] words you cannot see the kingdom of God
[58:09] when it arrives you cannot see it coming
[58:11] you cannot go to a place it's not like
[58:13] other kingdoms it's not a physical
[58:15] Kingdom when it comes it's a spiritual
[58:16] Kingdom he says neither shall they say
[58:19] Lo here or low there so it won't be a
[58:21] place you can go hear me this morning it
[58:23] won't be a church you can go to it won't
[58:25] be a denomination it won't be a Creed it
[58:28] won't be a country it won't be a
[58:30] community that is not the way the
[58:32] kingdom of God works amen you can't send
[58:35] someone there rather they have to become
[58:37] a part of it amen they have to be joined
[58:40] to it he says for what behold the
[58:42] kingdom of God is within you amen
[58:47] remember now that Jesus chose the 12
[58:49] disciples and Judas was one of them and
[58:52] yet God and yet he gave Judas a Ministry
[58:54] with tremendous signs of wonders we
[58:57] preached on this before I won't Bel it
[58:59] this morning but what was it they had an
[59:01] anointing on them but they did not have
[59:03] the Holy Spirit in them amen they
[59:06] weren't in the kingdom of God but they
[59:08] were under the influence of the kingdom
[59:10] of God but they weren't a part of it
[59:12] amen let's take it a step further
[59:14] further the scripture says out of the
[59:16] mouth there two or three Witnesses let a
[59:17] thing be established so let's take our
[59:19] second witness out of the scriptures and
[59:21] in Luke 10 it says and and and these
[59:23] things after these things the Lord
[59:25] appointed other 70 also there's 70 more
[59:28] disciples now remember he chose the
[59:31] first 12 but the 70 chose him he did not
[59:35] choose them they chose him there's a
[59:38] very big difference amen he never held
[59:41] back this Authority from them under
[59:43] their sincerity and under their
[59:44] commitment to him he gave them the same
[59:47] as he gave the other 12 disciples it
[59:49] says and he sent them two and two before
[59:51] his face into every city and place with
[59:54] he himself would come he sent them for
[59:56] him with a Ministry of signs and wonders
[59:58] in verse 9 says he told them heal the
[1:00:00] sick that are therein and say unto them
[1:00:03] the kingdom of God has come nigh unto
[1:00:05] you come nigh in other words it's nearly
[1:00:07] here but this is not it this is not it
[1:00:11] but he gave them the same signs wonders
[1:00:13] the same power the same Authority he
[1:00:15] gave them the same Ministry of the
[1:00:17] Gospel that he gave the the 12 that he
[1:00:19] chose there was no difference in their
[1:00:21] Ministry or their Authority at this
[1:00:24] point and watch the result verse 17 it
[1:00:26] says and the 70 returned again with Joy
[1:00:30] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[1:00:32] unto us through thy name they got the
[1:00:34] same results that the 12 that were
[1:00:36] chosen did but watches Jesus response
[1:00:39] now he says and he said unto them I
[1:00:41] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[1:00:44] Heaven behold I give unto you power to
[1:00:46] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[1:00:49] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[1:00:51] shall by any means hurt you and they did
[1:00:53] a Jericho March when he said it they
[1:00:56] started running they started shouting
[1:00:57] they said this is just the start of a
[1:00:59] great thing it's going to be amazing
[1:01:02] nothing's going to harm us nothing's
[1:01:04] going to touch us we have all power and
[1:01:06] all authority surely this is the promise
[1:01:09] that we're waiting
[1:01:13] for and Jesus says verse 20 not
[1:01:17] withstanding in this Rejoice not in
[1:01:21] other words don't get all happy about
[1:01:22] this he says that the spirits are
[1:01:24] subject unto you but rather Rejoice
[1:01:28] because your names are written in heaven
[1:01:32] and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[1:01:34] spirit and said I thank thee oh Father
[1:01:36] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast
[1:01:38] hid these things from the wise and
[1:01:40] prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[1:01:43] even so father for it seemed good in thy
[1:01:45] sight so Jesus is saying don't stop here
[1:01:48] don't rest here don't let this be your
[1:01:51] satisfying portion these signs and
[1:01:53] wonders that that you have power and
[1:01:55] author over demons that you're casting
[1:01:57] out sicknesses and and disease that
[1:01:59] you're raising the dead don't stop here
[1:02:02] don't let this be your comfort don't let
[1:02:04] this be your your anchor your your
[1:02:06] foundation amen these things are all
[1:02:09] part of the kingdom of God but they are
[1:02:11] not the kingdom of God this is not what
[1:02:13] I came to do in other words he's saying
[1:02:16] don't let your ministerial performance
[1:02:18] or don't let your gifts be your resting
[1:02:20] place amen we preached on this before
[1:02:22] and I mentioned it already that you can
[1:02:24] have an anointing on you every day of
[1:02:26] your life and go to
[1:02:28] hell absolutely you can amen you can be
[1:02:31] anointed by the Holy Spirit on your
[1:02:33] flesh but until your soul is sealed and
[1:02:36] there's a change of you you can still go
[1:02:39] to hell because an anointing on you is
[1:02:41] not the new birth it's just an anointing
[1:02:43] on you and if it's on you it can go off
[1:02:45] you but if it's in you and it's sealed
[1:02:47] it can never leave you and that's what
[1:02:49] eternal life is is the presence of God
[1:02:50] in you forever amen you can do all these
[1:02:53] things and not even be converted that's
[1:02:55] what we read earlier listen to this it
[1:02:57] says the Bible said in the last days
[1:02:59] there be false prophets Jesus said there
[1:03:01] shall rise false christs not false
[1:03:04] jesuses now cuz nobody would stand still
[1:03:06] for that but false Christ Christ means
[1:03:09] the anointed one falsely anointed they
[1:03:12] are anointed but they are false at the
[1:03:15] bottom of it so in other words their
[1:03:17] heart their soul condition is false and
[1:03:20] though they appear to be the real deal
[1:03:22] they have not had the Regeneration of
[1:03:23] the New Birth by the holy spirit amen
[1:03:26] and it takes time for it all to come out
[1:03:28] cuz by your fruits you'll know them but
[1:03:30] for a while they are the same as
[1:03:31] everybody else it looks like he says
[1:03:34] they are false at the bottom of it they
[1:03:36] do great signs and wonders they speak in
[1:03:39] tongues they dance in the spirit and
[1:03:41] they preach the gospel now watch this he
[1:03:43] says Judas a scariot did it Caiaphas
[1:03:46] prophesied balum the hypocrite remember
[1:03:49] Judas betrayed Jesus Caiaphas judged
[1:03:52] Christ and sent him to his death balum s
[1:03:55] reduced Israel into idol worship and yet
[1:03:58] all of them had signs and wonders and
[1:04:00] prophecies and and the evidence of the
[1:04:03] anointing of God in their
[1:04:05] lives he says sure they did all the
[1:04:07] signs everything all the religious moves
[1:04:09] but if you put a cockle bur a uh that's
[1:04:12] a like a thorn seed and a wheat seed in
[1:04:15] the same bed and pour the water upon
[1:04:18] them and anoint them they'll both
[1:04:20] Rejoice they'll both grow by it by the
[1:04:23] same water The Sun Shines on the just
[1:04:26] and the unjust and the rain falls on the
[1:04:27] just and the unjust but by their fruits
[1:04:31] ye shall know them the same thing that
[1:04:33] grows if you if you like to grow
[1:04:36] vegetables or fruits or or or flowers
[1:04:38] and you have your flower beds you'll
[1:04:40] notice that no matter what you do
[1:04:42] there's always going to be plants in
[1:04:43] there that you don't want why because
[1:04:46] the sunshine and the rain produce life
[1:04:48] no matter what but what it does is it
[1:04:51] produces life that shows exactly what
[1:04:54] each plant is and so you might start
[1:04:56] with a bunch of green things but as they
[1:04:58] grow and mature you realize some of
[1:05:00] these are what I planted and some of
[1:05:02] these are what nature put in there and
[1:05:04] I've got to weed those things out
[1:05:07] amen he says how can you keep from
[1:05:09] lining up with the word amen see what I
[1:05:12] mean the water falls on the just and the
[1:05:14] unjust they're anointed Jesus said
[1:05:17] they'll come to me in that day and say
[1:05:19] Lord Lord have I not cast out Devils
[1:05:21] have I not prophesied have I not done
[1:05:23] great things in your name and he'll say
[1:05:25] ye work workers of iniquity depart from
[1:05:27] me I don't even know you go into eternal
[1:05:30] hell that's been prepared for the devil
[1:05:31] and his angels He says you see what a
[1:05:34] word they are falsely anointed they
[1:05:37] worship in vain they're striving in vain
[1:05:40] he says why do you do that when you
[1:05:42] don't have to do it why take a
[1:05:44] substitute when the heavens are full of
[1:05:46] genuine you don't have to do
[1:05:50] it amen I I saw a a video clip of a
[1:05:53] young woman that's that's doing a 40
[1:05:56] days of of praying in the spirit for 30
[1:05:59] minutes a day and you know what she's
[1:06:00] doing she's walking up and down
[1:06:02] pretending she's talking in
[1:06:03] tongues why would you
[1:06:06] pretend what's the point of pretending
[1:06:08] you know you're doing
[1:06:10] it who are you fooling you're not
[1:06:12] fooling God you're not fooling yourself
[1:06:15] why not wait there until he gives you
[1:06:17] tongues if you want to speak in tongues
[1:06:19] but why walk up and down when it's
[1:06:20] completely obvious that you're just
[1:06:21] repeating the same thing over and over
[1:06:23] and over again it's not God working
[1:06:26] but what is it we don't want to
[1:06:28] wait we don't want to wait I'm here this
[1:06:32] is my time this is what I've given over
[1:06:34] this is when it needs to happen and so
[1:06:36] instead of waiting on God to do what the
[1:06:38] word says we try and produce it in
[1:06:39] ourselves and every time it produces
[1:06:42] what death that's all I can produce
[1:06:44] that's all you can produce is death it
[1:06:46] has to be God that does these things
[1:06:48] amen so if we look at signs and wonders
[1:06:51] and and gifts and these things as the
[1:06:52] comforter we'll see where we're left
[1:06:54] eventually and it's where those 70
[1:06:56] disciples were left and we can see what
[1:06:58] Jesus says about them in the scripture
[1:06:59] in John 6 he says it is the spirit that
[1:07:02] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:07:05] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:07:08] spirit and they are life I mean their
[1:07:10] focus was on the ministry and on the
[1:07:12] gifts and he says the words are where
[1:07:14] you need to be focused the words is
[1:07:16] where your rest needs to be we we've
[1:07:18] spoken on this much and I again I don't
[1:07:20] want to belabor but Jesus had preached
[1:07:22] that you must eat his flesh and drink
[1:07:24] his blood and he never explained it but
[1:07:26] he said unless you do it you won't have
[1:07:28] eternal life he wasn't talking about
[1:07:30] eating his literal body or drinking his
[1:07:32] literal blood he was saying you've got
[1:07:34] to take all of the word you've got to go
[1:07:36] all the way with the word but he never
[1:07:39] explained it amen but what it caused a
[1:07:41] lot of issues because it was a new
[1:07:43] doctrine they had never heard it before
[1:07:45] and they couldn't get past it and why
[1:07:47] couldn't they get past this church it
[1:07:50] says verse 64 but there are some of you
[1:07:53] that believe not
[1:07:56] they have performed great signs and
[1:07:58] wonders and yet Jesus said you don't
[1:08:01] believe what did they not believe the
[1:08:04] word that's where they stopped was when
[1:08:06] the word came in its fullness that's
[1:08:08] where they stopped amen he says you like
[1:08:10] the effects and you like the authority
[1:08:12] and the power of the ministry but you're
[1:08:14] resting in that instead of in the word
[1:08:17] that's coming behind
[1:08:18] it it says for Jesus knew from the
[1:08:22] beginning who they were that believed
[1:08:24] not and who should betray him Jesus had
[1:08:27] given them power and authority over
[1:08:29] devils and sickness and death and these
[1:08:31] different things and he knew that they
[1:08:33] would not accept his
[1:08:37] word and yet he did it and he says he
[1:08:40] knew from the beginning who there were
[1:08:42] that believed not and should who should
[1:08:43] betray him there's two groups there
[1:08:45] there's the unbelievers and then there's
[1:08:46] the betraying unbeliever and that's just
[1:08:48] one and that's Judas but they all walked
[1:08:51] away but Judas was the one that
[1:08:52] activated the Betrayal but yet Christ
[1:08:56] never held back from him in that moment
[1:09:00] amen Jesus knew they didn't fully
[1:09:02] believe the word yet he gave them power
[1:09:04] for a time and for a season it says and
[1:09:07] he said therefore said I unto you that
[1:09:09] no man can come unto me except it were
[1:09:12] given unto him of the father you cannot
[1:09:15] come to God unless God calls you we said
[1:09:17] before you can't come to God unless you
[1:09:19] were in God in the beginning we believe
[1:09:21] that we are predestinated amen and We
[1:09:22] Don't Preach predestination as God going
[1:09:24] through the church he's saying okay
[1:09:26] sister Lydia's in Sister Justine's out
[1:09:27] brother Bob's in we'll let sister Brenda
[1:09:29] go in because she's married to him and
[1:09:30] sister Morin sorry you're out but
[1:09:32] brother Mark you're in God doesn't go
[1:09:34] down the line saying in and out in and
[1:09:35] out in and out but rather before the
[1:09:38] foundation of the world Amen God had a
[1:09:41] thought and he had the attributes of
[1:09:42] himself that would be expressed in a
[1:09:44] family and because of that he wrote the
[1:09:47] names of those attributes into the
[1:09:49] Lamb's Book of Life and he said these
[1:09:51] are my children they will be with me
[1:09:55] that's what we believe predestination is
[1:09:57] it's not he didn't say those are out and
[1:09:59] those are in what he said is the ones
[1:10:01] that are in my thoughts that's my family
[1:10:04] and then what happened you see this in
[1:10:05] the parable of the swer is that what
[1:10:08] Satan came in and he sowed seed other
[1:10:11] seed Bad Seed in the world by the in the
[1:10:13] Garden of Eden and what was it it was
[1:10:15] bad seed and God did not reject them
[1:10:18] they just were not there to have their
[1:10:20] names written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:10:22] but yet some of them will be granted
[1:10:25] eternal life based on Works they're the
[1:10:28] only ones that truly have a choice he
[1:10:31] can't lose me Jesus said he'll lose none
[1:10:33] of his he'll lose none of his but those
[1:10:35] that are out there some of them will get
[1:10:37] in by works because they've done
[1:10:38] something for the bride of Christ
[1:10:40] they've done something that he deems
[1:10:41] worthy to grant them eternal life but we
[1:10:44] aren't granted eternal life we have
[1:10:46] eternal life we see we are eternal life
[1:10:48] as we go through this today amen but we
[1:10:51] were in Christ from the start like I
[1:10:53] said as Eve was in Adam we are in Christ
[1:10:55] from the start we didn't choose him he
[1:10:57] chose us and that's what takes us
[1:10:59] through is he's already put our name in
[1:11:01] the Lamb's Book of Life amen they can't
[1:11:03] ever receive the Holy Ghost because
[1:11:05] they're not a part of him but they can
[1:11:07] be granted eternal life at the end verse
[1:11:11] 66 it says and from that time many of
[1:11:13] his disciples went back and walked no
[1:11:16] more with him remember the 70 disciples
[1:11:18] chose Jesus and there came a time where
[1:11:20] they unch him Church my my my stability
[1:11:24] is not in my choosing of Christ this
[1:11:25] morning it's because he chose me there's
[1:11:28] something that holds me even when I
[1:11:30] can't hold there's something that
[1:11:32] anchors my soul even when I don't feel
[1:11:34] like it even when I don't seem like it
[1:11:36] at times amen why they weren't
[1:11:38] predestinated they weren't predestinated
[1:11:40] there was nothing that was in the mind
[1:11:42] of God about them before time began and
[1:11:45] that's why Jesus said Rejoice because
[1:11:47] your names are written in heaven where
[1:11:49] in the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:11:51] foundation of the
[1:11:53] world he was saying you're rejoice ing
[1:11:55] is
[1:11:56] premature cuz your names aren't
[1:11:59] there it's not bad to rejoice in the
[1:12:02] good things of God but you got to make
[1:12:04] sure that your name is in that book
[1:12:06] that's where our rejoicing is going to
[1:12:07] be amen I don't blame them for rejoicing
[1:12:11] amen but it was small Comfort at this
[1:12:12] point as they walked away and they lost
[1:12:14] all authority and all power they had
[1:12:17] nothing then said Jesus under the 12
[1:12:20] will ye also go away then Simon Peter
[1:12:23] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[1:12:26] thou Hast the words of eternal life
[1:12:28] Peter was not anchored in the signs and
[1:12:30] wonders Peter was anchored in the word
[1:12:32] that was coming from Christ amen that
[1:12:35] was his satisfying portion me that was
[1:12:37] his rest that was his comfort he says
[1:12:39] and we believe and are sure that thou
[1:12:42] art Christ the son of the Living God
[1:12:45] where was the comfort those 70 disciples
[1:12:47] had that walked away
[1:12:48] now they had it and then they fell away
[1:12:51] from it and now they had to go back to
[1:12:54] what they had left
[1:12:56] what's the point in going back to what
[1:12:57] you'd
[1:12:58] left now you're stuck in Middle Ground
[1:13:01] in no man's land you can't go back to
[1:13:03] what you left you can't move forward
[1:13:04] into what you thought was right and so
[1:13:06] you stay in this Purgatory we don't
[1:13:07] believe in purgatory but what you stay
[1:13:09] is in a place where you can't go
[1:13:10] anywhere because you don't fit with
[1:13:12] anybody what a shame that ought to be
[1:13:14] amen they had it all and yet they were
[1:13:16] left without Comfort why because they
[1:13:17] took comfort in the wrong
[1:13:19] thing Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 12
[1:13:22] he says now ye are the body of Christ
[1:13:24] and members in particular that phrase
[1:13:26] members in particular means that we're
[1:13:28] each individual we're distinct in our
[1:13:30] own position and purpose with our own
[1:13:32] gifts and Ministries and that means that
[1:13:34] you don't have to be the same as me and
[1:13:36] I don't have to be the same as you and
[1:13:37] none of us has to be the same as each
[1:13:39] other but we need to be in agreement
[1:13:42] because the body works together it can't
[1:13:45] it can't fight itself amen we have to
[1:13:46] work together not against each other he
[1:13:48] says and God had said some in the church
[1:13:52] now watch the order watch what God deems
[1:13:54] most important
[1:13:55] first apostles secondarily prophets
[1:13:58] thirdly teachers after that Miracles and
[1:14:01] Gifts of healings helps governments and
[1:14:04] diversities of tongues amen what is most
[1:14:06] important to God the word because the
[1:14:08] first thing he puts there the first
[1:14:09] three things are the word the word the
[1:14:11] word people that bring the word of God
[1:14:13] then after that comes the Miracles the
[1:14:16] healings the helps the governments and
[1:14:17] the diversities of tongues
[1:14:19] amen so what's he saying he's saying
[1:14:22] where's your comfort
[1:14:26] right that we are a minister that we are
[1:14:28] a deacon that we are the wife of a
[1:14:30] deacon the wife of a minister that we
[1:14:32] play the music that we lead the songs no
[1:14:34] our comfort is not in those things now
[1:14:37] because watch what he says here in verse
[1:14:38] 29 are all
[1:14:40] Apostles are all prophets are all
[1:14:43] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[1:14:45] we're talking about the comforter today
[1:14:47] and Paul's going through the list and
[1:14:48] he's challenging us and he's saying does
[1:14:50] everyone do something big and obvious
[1:14:52] and Supernatural in the church
[1:14:55] does everyone have a grand position does
[1:14:57] everyone have a uh something that's
[1:15:00] big and
[1:15:03] wonderful he's not asking that because
[1:15:05] the answer is
[1:15:06] yes he's saying no obviously we're not
[1:15:08] all
[1:15:10] Apostles you can we can't all be thumbs
[1:15:14] the body has different parts amen so in
[1:15:17] what he's saying is in doing them you
[1:15:19] can't have your comfort and in not doing
[1:15:21] them can't be your discomfort don't look
[1:15:24] at what you're doing as your comfort
[1:15:25] amen that's not where we rest he
[1:15:27] continues he says have all the gifts of
[1:15:29] healings gift of healing do all speak
[1:15:32] with tongues do all interpret again
[1:15:34] Paul's not saying this because we do do
[1:15:36] we all heal can everyone in raise their
[1:15:38] hand and say yes i' I've laid hands on
[1:15:40] somebody I prayed for someone and
[1:15:41] they've been healed no so the answer is
[1:15:44] no then he says do all speak with
[1:15:46] tongues no you go to a Pentecostal
[1:15:49] Church they say yes you will if you have
[1:15:51] the Holy Ghost Paul says no they don't
[1:15:53] not everyone speaks with tongues they
[1:15:55] says do all interpret again some do some
[1:15:58] don't that's not where our comfort is
[1:16:01] amen it will not be our anchor in our
[1:16:03] time of trouble that I spoke with
[1:16:05] tongues or that somebody was healed
[1:16:06] under my Ministry or prayer that's not
[1:16:08] my anchor that's not my anchor it didn't
[1:16:11] hold the 70 disciples it didn't hold
[1:16:13] Judas it's not going to hold me and it's
[1:16:15] not going to hold you the signs and
[1:16:17] wonders never converted anyone the word
[1:16:20] converted them that's the only thing
[1:16:23] that did it that's the only thing that
[1:16:24] did did it listen Israel spent 40 years
[1:16:28] under the supernatural Pillar of Fire
[1:16:30] pillar of cloud their clothes didn't
[1:16:32] wear out they have food when they needed
[1:16:34] it and all but two perished in the
[1:16:36] wilderness why because they stood on the
[1:16:39] word we are more than able why because
[1:16:43] the word says we are going to inherit
[1:16:46] that's where they stood they were
[1:16:48] converted by the word not by the gifts
[1:16:50] amen the gifts and these things are
[1:16:53] meant to draw people
[1:16:55] they will never convert people Jesus
[1:16:58] said you're here for the Loaves and the
[1:17:00] fishes but would they accept his
[1:17:03] word Paul says in verse 31 but covet
[1:17:06] earnestly the best gifts why because the
[1:17:10] best gifts edify the body the
[1:17:13] most the gifts are given for service not
[1:17:17] for
[1:17:17] self he says the greater your gift the
[1:17:21] healthier the body the greater the
[1:17:23] effect that you can have there amen but
[1:17:25] gifts we know are not about performance
[1:17:27] gifts are about surrender scripture says
[1:17:31] humble thyself in the sight of the Lord
[1:17:33] and He Shall lift you up the more that
[1:17:35] you can get out of the way the more that
[1:17:37] God can use you amen that's the way it
[1:17:40] is Paul says covet earnestly the best
[1:17:43] gifts be sincere but then he says and
[1:17:46] yet show I unto you a more excellent way
[1:17:50] so in other words there's more to the
[1:17:51] Christian walk than signs and wonders
[1:17:53] and speaking in tongu
[1:17:55] then then then gifts and all these
[1:17:57] different things amen that is not our
[1:17:59] comfort our rest or our anchoring Point
[1:18:01] amen what's the most excellent way the
[1:18:03] more excellent way in Chapter 13 this is
[1:18:05] the love chapter Paul says though I
[1:18:08] speak with the tongue tongues of men and
[1:18:11] angels and have not charity I am become
[1:18:14] as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[1:18:17] that means a noisy gong or a clanging
[1:18:20] symbol anybody ever get a drum set for
[1:18:22] their kids at some point nobody we're
[1:18:24] too smart for that because what do they
[1:18:26] do they make a noisy gong and a clanging
[1:18:28] symbol all they want to do is make noise
[1:18:30] we have two guitars in our house we have
[1:18:32] one that's Out Of Tune and we have one
[1:18:33] that's in tune and guess which one my
[1:18:35] youngest son
[1:18:36] has the Out Of Tune one and guess which
[1:18:39] one plays the loudest the Out Of Tune
[1:18:41] one what is it because he's just doing
[1:18:44] whatever he feels to do and he'll sing
[1:18:45] his songs along with it and it's
[1:18:48] completely out ofune it is not a Joyful
[1:18:51] Noise it's a funny noise and it's
[1:18:53] endearing but it is not something we
[1:18:55] want him doing in church that's for
[1:18:57] sure why it's just a clanging
[1:19:01] symbol and Paul says here he says if I
[1:19:04] speak with all the tongues of men and
[1:19:06] angels I speak every language of man and
[1:19:08] I speak in tongues and I don't have this
[1:19:10] kind of love he says I'm just making a
[1:19:13] bunch of
[1:19:16] noise but then he elevates it he says
[1:19:19] and though I have the gift of
[1:19:23] Prophecy and under understand all
[1:19:26] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:19:29] have all Faith so that I could remove
[1:19:32] mountains and have not charity I am
[1:19:39] nothing how satisfied would we be this
[1:19:42] morning if thus sayith the Lord was
[1:19:44] coming through us if we could speak and
[1:19:48] things would change and I'm not saying
[1:19:49] we don't I believe we do but if we could
[1:19:52] have all faith if we knew every we knew
[1:19:55] the word from front to back all the way
[1:19:58] through we had all the revelations of
[1:19:59] the word we would sit here and our
[1:20:01] comfort would be I know it
[1:20:05] all I have it
[1:20:08] all I can do it
[1:20:10] all and God's using me in a supernatural
[1:20:13] way how satisfied would we be this
[1:20:15] morning if that was happening and Paul
[1:20:18] says if I have not charity I
[1:20:21] am nothing
[1:20:25] he says and though I bestow all my goods
[1:20:28] to feed the poor and though I give my
[1:20:31] body to be burned and have not charity
[1:20:34] it profiteth me nothing we can do great
[1:20:36] works of sacrifice and labor but without
[1:20:39] that love it does us no good and it is
[1:20:42] has no representation before God if I
[1:20:45] can put it that way the more excellent
[1:20:47] way is love amen this is not our kind of
[1:20:49] love this is not physical or intimate
[1:20:51] love it's not familial love it's agape
[1:20:54] love the Greek GRE word Agape amen it's
[1:20:56] the love of God which is the Holy Ghost
[1:20:58] the scripture says God is love it's his
[1:21:01] very nature it's his very attribute this
[1:21:03] is a new testament word and it is only
[1:21:05] for the New Testament believer it is the
[1:21:07] Holy Ghost it is the supernatural love
[1:21:10] amen it's the love that knows no bounds
[1:21:12] it's the love that surpasses every
[1:21:14] emotion it's the love that takes us
[1:21:15] through every circumstance it's the love
[1:21:17] that overlooks fault and failure amen
[1:21:22] amen it is love that changes us it's
[1:21:23] love that perfect us and matures us it's
[1:21:26] a love that never fails the scripture
[1:21:27] says there's only one thing that never
[1:21:30] fails what is it the word of God so what
[1:21:34] is the love it is the Living Word it is
[1:21:37] the Holy Ghost living in you and I
[1:21:39] producing Christ all over again yes
[1:21:41] Christ had signs and wonders yes Christ
[1:21:43] was a prophet and he did and he did
[1:21:45] wonderful things but his identification
[1:21:47] was through the word it was always
[1:21:50] through the word and it was being led by
[1:21:52] the spirit to fulfill the word that was
[1:21:54] written about him remember we read that
[1:21:56] in in in the scriptures a while back he
[1:21:58] said Lo in the book it is written of me
[1:22:01] I come to do thy will oh God so the
[1:22:04] continuation of the works of Christ that
[1:22:06] he promised is to fulfill the word that
[1:22:08] was written about him and so we've got
[1:22:11] to fulfill the word that's written about
[1:22:12] us when Christ ultimately laid down his
[1:22:15] life where was his
[1:22:17] comfort where was his comfort was was
[1:22:19] his comfort in his ministry was it in
[1:22:21] his Perfection was it in the signs and w
[1:22:24] ERS was it in the prophecies he'd given
[1:22:27] no Christ's Comfort was in one
[1:22:30] place for thou wil not leave my soul in
[1:22:33] Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy
[1:22:36] One to see corruption his comfort was in
[1:22:39] the word that was written about him that
[1:22:41] it would never leave him it would never
[1:22:43] forsake Him it would not leave him in
[1:22:45] his condition but it would take him from
[1:22:47] Death all the way back into eternal life
[1:22:49] and it would restore him and give him
[1:22:51] his kingdom and in that we were with him
[1:22:55] in that we were with him amen when he
[1:22:58] rose we rose with him because we died he
[1:23:01] took our place so we die with him and
[1:23:03] when he rose that's our promise that we
[1:23:05] have everlasting life that if we die and
[1:23:07] we pass from this this place into
[1:23:09] another yet we'll come back and we'll be
[1:23:11] picked up and taken to be within and if
[1:23:13] we are alive and remain that same spirit
[1:23:16] that dwells in Jesus Christ will Quicken
[1:23:18] this Mortal
[1:23:19] body that's our promise this morning
[1:23:22] amen that's the Comfort I have is that
[1:23:24] his word says we've received eternal
[1:23:27] life amen that his death would not be
[1:23:30] the end of him there's a lot of people
[1:23:32] going to be disappointed in the end when
[1:23:35] they're standing before a great white
[1:23:36] throne and they're trying to give their
[1:23:38] excuses as to why their reasons why they
[1:23:42] dece receive eternal life amen they'll
[1:23:45] offer their argument but watch what
[1:23:47] Jesus says and we've quoted it earlier
[1:23:49] he says not everyone that saith unto me
[1:23:51] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:23:54] of of Heaven he says but he that doeth
[1:23:57] the will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:24:00] see it's not about doing great things
[1:24:01] it's about doing what God wants you to
[1:24:03] do and how does he let you know that by
[1:24:06] his word amen the Holy Spirit quickens
[1:24:08] us to the word great things are not our
[1:24:10] comfort being in God's will is our
[1:24:12] comfort amen because yay though I walk
[1:24:14] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:24:15] death I'll fear no evil no matter our
[1:24:18] situation when we're in his will we can
[1:24:20] have comfort because he said he'd be
[1:24:21] with us amen our comfort is in that word
[1:24:23] that's been quickened by the Holy
[1:24:26] Spirit he says many will say to me in
[1:24:29] that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:24:31] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:24:33] have cast out devils and in thy name
[1:24:35] done many wonderful works the 70
[1:24:37] disciples did that Judas did that it
[1:24:39] makes me
[1:24:40] wonder as people are standing there
[1:24:43] watching as after the first one goes
[1:24:44] through and offers that and he says you
[1:24:46] can't come in if they'll even offer the
[1:24:49] argument because if that's where we're
[1:24:51] resting on our works we're lost
[1:24:54] that is not it we have works but that is
[1:24:57] not our resting
[1:24:59] place he says and then will I profess
[1:25:01] unto them I never knew you depart from
[1:25:05] me ye that work
[1:25:07] iniquity what does that word iniquity
[1:25:09] mean to do what you know to not do what
[1:25:14] you know to do to refuse to do what he
[1:25:16] told you listen what did they turn down
[1:25:19] they turn down the word cu the word
[1:25:22] tells us what to do every time they
[1:25:24] turned down the word amen they didn't
[1:25:26] turn down the works they loved the works
[1:25:29] they turned down the word and so their
[1:25:30] works could never align with what God
[1:25:32] wanted them to do Jesus just days before
[1:25:35] he was crucified he's in Jerusalem and
[1:25:37] remember the lamb had to be inspected so
[1:25:38] he goes in day in and day out comes back
[1:25:41] in and he's questioned by the priesthood
[1:25:42] about his authority and his ministry and
[1:25:45] then he gives them this response and it
[1:25:46] says Jesus saith unto them did you never
[1:25:49] read in the scriptures the stone with
[1:25:52] the which the builders rejected the same
[1:25:55] is become the head of the corner this is
[1:25:57] the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in
[1:25:59] our eyes what is The Headstone what is
[1:26:02] the
[1:26:03] Cornerstone Peter had already revealed
[1:26:05] it he said who do you I the son of man
[1:26:07] am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[1:26:09] the son of the Living God and Jesus said
[1:26:11] Upon This Rock I will build my church it
[1:26:15] wasn't on Peter he wasn't the first pope
[1:26:19] it was built on the revelation of Jesus
[1:26:22] Christ and Jesus is saying here
[1:26:24] what are you rejecting you're rejecting
[1:26:26] the revelation of who I am and because
[1:26:29] of that you'll be
[1:26:31] rejected he says therefore say I unto
[1:26:34] you the kingdom of God shall be taken
[1:26:36] from you what's the kingdom of God the
[1:26:38] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost shall be taken
[1:26:40] from you and given to a nation bringing
[1:26:43] fruit forth the fruits thereof Israel
[1:26:47] turned it down so it went to the
[1:26:48] Gentiles and they produ the same thing
[1:26:50] that Christ
[1:26:51] produced in in Matthew 21 did they turn
[1:26:54] down the Holy Ghost did Jesus say here's
[1:26:56] the Holy Ghost receive it and they say
[1:26:58] sorry we don't want that no what did
[1:27:00] they turn down the word and the Word was
[1:27:03] what was going to lead them to the Holy
[1:27:04] Ghost see they didn't know who he was
[1:27:06] and when they turned him down they
[1:27:07] turned down his message and they could
[1:27:09] not receive What followed his message
[1:27:11] they could never receive the comforter
[1:27:12] they were sincere perhaps but they're
[1:27:15] sincerely wrong and guess what sincerely
[1:27:17] wrong doesn't get you in we can be so
[1:27:20] sincere amen but it's the word that'll
[1:27:22] test our sincerity because when it comes
[1:27:24] before us and we refuse it it means that
[1:27:26] we're not really in it for sincerity
[1:27:27] we're in it for ourselves we refuse to
[1:27:29] make a move
[1:27:32] amen what was the holding strength of
[1:27:34] the disciples after Jesus left cuz
[1:27:37] remember he's with them for about 40
[1:27:38] days and then he ascends and he's gone
[1:27:42] and they're left with nothing and what
[1:27:44] held them for the next 10 days the same
[1:27:47] thing that held Christ the word it was
[1:27:49] the promise of Jesus he said behold I
[1:27:51] send the promise of the father upon you
[1:27:53] the comforter the Holy Ghost he says but
[1:27:56] T ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye
[1:27:59] be endued with power from on high
[1:28:01] remember God never ask us to do
[1:28:03] something without a purpose God's not
[1:28:05] just messing around with our lives God
[1:28:07] is doing it for a purpose amen he told
[1:28:09] them to T that means you're going to
[1:28:12] have to wait and you're going to have to
[1:28:13] wait and you're going to have to wait
[1:28:14] and you're going to have to wait until
[1:28:16] something changes he told them amen
[1:28:19] their comfort though was that the word
[1:28:21] spoken by Christ was that they would
[1:28:23] have the same life in them that he had
[1:28:26] in him so the promise is what held them
[1:28:28] amen that they'd experience the
[1:28:30] indwelling god in the same way that he
[1:28:32] did amen and then when that happened
[1:28:35] they'd be comforted because they'd see
[1:28:37] he hadn't really left but rather he had
[1:28:39] descended again and he was with them the
[1:28:40] same way he was except the Corporal body
[1:28:43] that was the Comfort amen Church realize
[1:28:45] this we've already read it Peter already
[1:28:48] had power over sickness Peter already
[1:28:51] had power over demons Peter already had
[1:28:53] power over
[1:28:55] death that was not the power that he was
[1:28:57] being ued with here Peter already had
[1:29:00] those things amen Peter didn't need
[1:29:02] power over everything else Peter needed
[1:29:03] power over Peter Peter was the failing
[1:29:06] Point here the power out there was not
[1:29:08] the failing point this flesh was the
[1:29:10] failing Point Peter needed overcoming
[1:29:12] power in the face of opposition in the
[1:29:14] face of persecution when his life was on
[1:29:17] the line Peter kept backing down Peter
[1:29:19] needed something that would take him
[1:29:21] from Fear into courage Peter needed a
[1:29:24] nature
[1:29:25] change that's what Peter was in need of
[1:29:27] Amen remember what Jesus said he says
[1:29:30] fear not I have overcome the world he
[1:29:33] wasn't talking about that he was talking
[1:29:35] about the influence of on him he had
[1:29:37] passed every Temptation he had gone
[1:29:40] through everything that we go through
[1:29:42] yet without sin and he's saying don't
[1:29:44] worry about it cuz I've got power coming
[1:29:46] that'll give you the same sort of thing
[1:29:47] it'll take you through when you don't
[1:29:49] think you can go through amen Peter
[1:29:51] needed that kind of Victory amen he
[1:29:53] needed that kind of power you'll notice
[1:29:55] after Peter's uh conversion the signs
[1:29:58] and the Wonders did not
[1:30:01] change what he did before he did after
[1:30:04] what changed Peter himself changed and
[1:30:09] his message
[1:30:10] changed cuz remember his message before
[1:30:13] was
[1:30:14] repent and the kingdom of God is
[1:30:17] coming when he comes down what is his
[1:30:19] message now the kingdom of God is here
[1:30:24] it's not there it's here it's here what
[1:30:28] Peter has become the word of his day
[1:30:31] Peter's got a message of a personal
[1:30:33] experience that the message he's
[1:30:35] received works and it has a lasting
[1:30:37] effect amen it wasn't just repentance
[1:30:39] amen but it was a message of eternal
[1:30:42] life amen that was the conversion needed
[1:30:44] into his life and it's the same thing
[1:30:46] for us it's not about having the word
[1:30:48] it's about becoming the word we need the
[1:30:50] inward Victory before we can ever hope
[1:30:52] to really have a true effect on the
[1:30:54] outside amen Peter already had a
[1:30:56] Ministry Peter already had a gift he had
[1:30:58] signs and wonders and yet he wasn't con
[1:31:00] he wasn't converted he kept backing down
[1:31:02] but after the day of Pentecost when he
[1:31:04] received the same life that Christ had
[1:31:07] after he carried after he had obeyed the
[1:31:09] word he had the same Ministry that
[1:31:11] Christ had in every single way
[1:31:16] amen listen to what they say about Peter
[1:31:19] afterwards remember Jesus said to Peter
[1:31:21] you're going to deny me you're going to
[1:31:23] going to deny me Peter tonight you think
[1:31:25] you got it you're going to deny me watch
[1:31:27] the testimony of those that he was
[1:31:29] scared of before says now when they saw
[1:31:32] the
[1:31:34] boldness see Peter was a wimp before up
[1:31:37] and down up and down in and out he' back
[1:31:38] away when things got tough when they saw
[1:31:41] the boldness of Peter and John and
[1:31:43] perceived that they were unlearned and
[1:31:45] ignorant men they marveled and they took
[1:31:48] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:31:50] with
[1:31:51] Jesus it was boldness
[1:31:54] it was a Ministry that was different see
[1:31:56] the change was not in his gifts the
[1:31:58] change was in Peter Peter didn't back
[1:32:01] down in this scripture they had already
[1:32:03] dragged him to prison for the night and
[1:32:05] then he stood him up in front of them
[1:32:06] and they started quizzing him and Peter
[1:32:08] refused to back down Peter said you can
[1:32:11] do whatever you
[1:32:13] want I ain't going to stop preaching
[1:32:16] I've got a commission and I'm going to
[1:32:19] keep doing it amen what was it Peter had
[1:32:22] passed from Death unto life
[1:32:24] perfect love had cast out all fear in
[1:32:26] Peter Peter didn't care what had
[1:32:28] happened to his body because he knew
[1:32:30] that if this body would be dissolved
[1:32:32] there was another one waiting for him
[1:32:34] elsewhere amen he wasn't worried about
[1:32:36] what was going to happen because what he
[1:32:37] needed to happen it happened he had his
[1:32:39] comfort he had his Assurance amen he was
[1:32:42] settled on this thing amen he didn't
[1:32:44] just have eternal life he was eternal
[1:32:46] life it was the life of God now in him
[1:32:49] he was no longer a slave to his own
[1:32:51] nature amen what was Peter's comfort
[1:32:53] Church Peter's Comfort was that the word
[1:32:56] that had been given to him had produced
[1:32:59] itself in his life he wasn't just
[1:33:02] preaching it now he was living it that
[1:33:05] was his comfort that's the comfort that
[1:33:06] we're supposed to have amen and these
[1:33:09] the the the priests and the captains and
[1:33:10] these different ones they realize now
[1:33:12] that he'd been with Jesus because
[1:33:14] remember Jesus never backed down he
[1:33:16] spoke with authority and he was fearless
[1:33:18] and Peter now has the same Ministry he
[1:33:20] has the same style he has the same
[1:33:22] nature he has the same persona he has
[1:33:24] the the the same Assurance in his words
[1:33:26] remember they said about Jesus he spoke
[1:33:28] with authority unlike the the priests
[1:33:31] Peter's got the same thing and they're
[1:33:32] like this guy doesn't know anything he
[1:33:34] isn't he's barely taught he he can
[1:33:36] barely write and look at this guy he's
[1:33:38] got more than we've
[1:33:41] got Peter received the comforter the
[1:33:44] Living Word the same Holy Spirit
[1:33:45] dwelling in him that was in Christ catch
[1:33:48] this as we start to
[1:33:50] close one day that word was made flesh
[1:33:53] that that's it that word was made flesh
[1:33:55] in the form of a man the word of God
[1:33:57] that brought Comfort was made a man here
[1:33:59] among us we could handle the word of God
[1:34:01] in our hands we could shake hands with
[1:34:03] the word of God he was the word the
[1:34:05] scripture says in the beginning was the
[1:34:06] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:34:08] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:34:10] dwelt Among Us that word of God was made
[1:34:13] flesh the comforter he lived here on
[1:34:15] Earth we see he was the word he acted
[1:34:18] like God he looked like God he preached
[1:34:21] like God he healed like God he was God
[1:34:24] in every manner he was God he talked
[1:34:27] like the word he looked like the word he
[1:34:29] preached like the word he was the word
[1:34:31] amen oh what a comfort it would have
[1:34:33] been to sit down by him wouldn't you
[1:34:36] have loved to have done it why I would
[1:34:38] have run to him sit down by his side
[1:34:40] when he was here on
[1:34:41] Earth I'd love to have him touch my eye
[1:34:43] this
[1:34:44] morning he can still do
[1:34:47] it but how what a comfort it would be
[1:34:49] this morning to go and say if if you'll
[1:34:53] just speak the
[1:34:54] word or you'll just lay hands on me I
[1:34:57] know it'll go
[1:34:58] away what a comfort that would
[1:35:02] be he says now one day they saw him go
[1:35:04] to Calvary they heard him saying a
[1:35:07] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:35:08] more I'm the son of man must go to
[1:35:11] Jerusalem be put into the hands of
[1:35:12] sinful men and be crucified and die how
[1:35:15] could they stand it their hearts were
[1:35:17] broken they were depressed they were all
[1:35:19] in Gloom how could they ever give him up
[1:35:22] because the word that the prophet has
[1:35:23] spoken the word that the sages and all
[1:35:25] the great holy men back to the end the
[1:35:27] beginning of the world had spoken of
[1:35:29] that word and here it was among them the
[1:35:32] greatest thing ever put in flesh and he
[1:35:35] says I'm going to
[1:35:36] leave he says but now look what a
[1:35:39] promise he made I will not leave you
[1:35:42] comfortless I will not leave you
[1:35:44] comfortless I'll pray the father and
[1:35:45] he'll send you another comforter which
[1:35:47] is the Holy Ghost and he'll abide with
[1:35:49] you forever even the spirit of Truth now
[1:35:52] we said this earlier he says who whom
[1:35:53] the world cannot receive because it
[1:35:55] knoweth him not it seeth him not neither
[1:35:58] does it know him the world can't receive
[1:36:00] the Holy Ghost because they're not a
[1:36:01] part of him they can't receive the word
[1:36:04] he says but you know him you know him
[1:36:06] because he's with you and he shall be in
[1:36:09] you he says there it is and how long is
[1:36:13] he going to abide forever then what is
[1:36:16] the word of God what is our comfort
[1:36:18] today it's when we receive the baptism
[1:36:21] of the Holy Ghost and the power power of
[1:36:24] the Living God living in us he says and
[1:36:27] with that with the word of the Living
[1:36:29] God we stand that word is made flesh and
[1:36:32] dwelt Among Us now that same word that
[1:36:36] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us has
[1:36:39] become our flesh he says he is with you
[1:36:42] but he shall be in you he says now that
[1:36:45] same word that the prophet spoke that
[1:36:48] same word that was made flesh that same
[1:36:51] word dwells in the church
[1:36:53] therefore if we don't compromise that
[1:36:57] word we stay right with it if we don't
[1:36:59] compromise it that same word living in
[1:37:03] you will produce the same thing it did
[1:37:06] when it was made flesh because your
[1:37:09] flesh holds it hallelujah what do we see
[1:37:12] after Pentecost what do we see after
[1:37:15] that 10 days in the upper room we see
[1:37:17] Christ The Living Word in flesh again
[1:37:20] they saw and they knew that they had
[1:37:22] been with Jesus they recognized that
[1:37:24] their Ministry was the same as
[1:37:26] his it was the Living Word all over
[1:37:28] again it's Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the
[1:37:31] same yesterday today and forever what it
[1:37:34] was the same Living Word it never ended
[1:37:37] when Christ went up but rather he
[1:37:39] descended and gave gifts to men he gave
[1:37:41] his life in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:43] and that's how we know we've not been
[1:37:45] forsaken that he hasn't left us without
[1:37:47] hope and comfort amen that we're just
[1:37:49] set a drift defend for ourselves what is
[1:37:51] it it's the comfort of Christ in us the
[1:37:54] hope of glory that'll be in us all the
[1:37:56] way to the end
[1:37:59] amen as we close why is it men thirst
[1:38:03] and hunger because when he was made he
[1:38:06] was made and created with a little place
[1:38:08] in him that God dwelt to comfort him and
[1:38:11] when he shook himself away from God by
[1:38:13] sin then that place is vacant and that's
[1:38:16] why he's hungering for it reaching for
[1:38:19] it and the trouble today with us
[1:38:22] Christians
[1:38:23] he's not speaking to the world now he's
[1:38:25] speaking to us is I'm afraid we're not
[1:38:28] doing all we can do to show our fallen
[1:38:31] brother that that's what's the matter
[1:38:33] with
[1:38:34] him he says that's what's the matter
[1:38:37] with juvenile delinquency is because
[1:38:38] there's been a delinquency in the church
[1:38:40] and a delinquency in the home that's
[1:38:42] made the juvenile a
[1:38:45] delinquent it's a hard thing to tell
[1:38:48] somebody everything you think you need
[1:38:52] will never satisfy you
[1:38:54] when they go buy their new car when they
[1:38:56] go on their next great vacation when
[1:38:58] they get their second and third and
[1:38:59] fourth wife or husband to say that's
[1:39:02] never going to work when they go out and
[1:39:05] they drink all weekend and they come in
[1:39:06] with a hangover on Monday morning to say
[1:39:08] that's never going to work some of you
[1:39:10] have a testimony some of you used to
[1:39:13] drink some of you used to live for the
[1:39:15] weekend you're the ones that can say
[1:39:18] that is not going to satisfy but you can
[1:39:20] say I found a satisfying portion and you
[1:39:22] can have the same thing but he says
[1:39:25] we're delinquent because we won't share
[1:39:26] with people what the answer
[1:39:28] is what does it take Church a boldness
[1:39:32] that you have received the
[1:39:35] reality of the answer it's not just a
[1:39:38] Doctrine it's not just my church it's
[1:39:40] not just my pastor it's not just the
[1:39:41] ministry it's I have the
[1:39:45] comforter I've got what you
[1:39:48] need he says that's the reason they're
[1:39:50] on the streets jumping up and down is
[1:39:52] because they're trying to find something
[1:39:54] to satisfy he said let me say this
[1:39:56] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:59] there's nothing will satisfy like the
[1:40:01] coming of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:04] that will change your life and your
[1:40:06] attitudes and give you comfort and
[1:40:09] eternal life amen let's stand together
[1:40:13] if we would what a place change your
[1:40:16] life change your
[1:40:18] attitudes you know what having a eye
[1:40:21] that bugs you and your eyes get red and
[1:40:22] sore by the end of the day I need an
[1:40:25] attitude changer by the end of the day
[1:40:26] you know guess what I have a
[1:40:29] comforter when life wears us down we
[1:40:31] have a comforter amen what is it it's
[1:40:34] Christ tabernacled in human flesh again
[1:40:36] know ye not ye are the Temple of the
[1:40:39] Holy Ghost amen it's not all signs and
[1:40:42] wonders but it's there it may not be
[1:40:45] speaking in tongues and interpretation
[1:40:47] it might be there it may not be prophecy
[1:40:48] but it's there amen but rather our
[1:40:50] comfort is when he comes down with his
[1:40:52] word and he produces it in you and I
[1:40:55] that's the Comfort amen that's what our
[1:40:57] comfort is not that we've heard the word
[1:40:58] for our age it's that we've become the
[1:41:01] word for our age listen Jesus had a
[1:41:03] Ministry of three and a half years and
[1:41:05] Peter and the disciples and the other uh
[1:41:07] ones that made up the 120 they heard a
[1:41:10] lot of things and they saw a lot of
[1:41:12] things and they enjoyed a lot of things
[1:41:15] but when he left their only comfort they
[1:41:17] had was when a word came down and
[1:41:19] produced itself in them again the signs
[1:41:22] and wonders didn't hold them
[1:41:24] it was the reality of the word the
[1:41:27] reality of the message that he had
[1:41:29] preached to them amen what's our comfort
[1:41:31] it's the Holy Ghost in US preparing us
[1:41:34] to fulfill the word for our age what's
[1:41:37] the word for our age a resurrection and
[1:41:40] a Rapture amen scripture says the bride
[1:41:43] has made herself ready what has she done
[1:41:46] she's taken the word she's wrapped
[1:41:48] herself in his righteousness and she has
[1:41:50] submitted herself to his word and now
[1:41:53] she's waiting for him to take her so
[1:41:55] what's my comfort my comfort is day by
[1:41:58] day the words changing me right it's
[1:42:01] producing the scripture says she'll be a
[1:42:02] bride without spot or wrinkle she'll be
[1:42:06] separated amen she'll have the Life of
[1:42:09] Christ in
[1:42:10] her and how does he do it he does it by
[1:42:13] the word we're seeing things in the word
[1:42:16] that we have never seen before it's
[1:42:18] opening up this great Plan of Redemption
[1:42:21] this whole book is a book of redemption
[1:42:24] and it's opening up in ways that it has
[1:42:26] never opened up before why because it's
[1:42:29] got to come to pass and he shows it to
[1:42:31] us so that we can ask for it so that we
[1:42:33] can believe for it so that we can apply
[1:42:36] it and then he comes down and by the
[1:42:37] Holy Ghost he makes it live in our life
[1:42:39] amen that's the Comfort like I said
[1:42:41] before my comfort is that I'm not who I
[1:42:43] was yesterday I'm not who I was last
[1:42:45] week last month last year but I'm being
[1:42:47] changed from Glory unto glory amen into
[1:42:51] the image of Christ until one day he
[1:42:54] comes down and he says it's finished and
[1:42:56] he sweeps us away and we get to go and
[1:42:58] be with him eternally amen what a
[1:43:00] wonderful
[1:43:03] thing I'm thankful when he heals I'm
[1:43:06] thankful for when he
[1:43:08] provides amen but that's not my anchor
[1:43:11] my anchor is that he fulfills his word
[1:43:13] in my life amen God bless you let's bow
[1:43:16] our
[1:43:17] heads Lord Jesus Lord how thankful we
[1:43:21] are for your word this morning Lord how
