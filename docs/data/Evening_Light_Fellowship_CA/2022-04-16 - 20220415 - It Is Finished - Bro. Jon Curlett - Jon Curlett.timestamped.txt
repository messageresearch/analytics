[49:00] lord from a heart that knows that it was
[49:02] my sin
[49:03] that put you on that cross heavenly
[49:05] father
[49:06] lord and if everyone else in the world
[49:08] was perfect lord yet you had to die for

[49:11] all because our price had to be paid
[49:14] and lord we're here tonight in
[49:15] commemoration of the price that you paid
[49:18] lord but not just the price that you
[49:20] paid lord but what you opened up when
[49:21] you paid that price
[49:23] lord the door that was opened
[49:26] lord the blessings that were released
[49:29] lord the placing that was given back to
[49:31] the believer if they'll only walk in
[49:33] faith lord by the grace that you've
[49:35] given
[49:36] so lord we want to say thank you tonight
[49:38] yes
[49:39] [Music]
[49:42] we could say it all day
[49:45] it'd never be enough amen lord we could
[49:49] write of your love from the
[49:50] rise and of the son to the going down of
[49:52] the same and we'd never run out of
[49:54] things to say
[49:56] but lord let us simply just say thank
[49:58] you
[49:58] amen lord may our lives be a thank you
[50:01] lord that resonates far beyond our words
[50:04] lord may our lives just reflect
[50:06] lord show appreciation
[50:09] lord show the effect of the price that
[50:11] you paid that day
[50:13] lord now minister through lord your
[50:15] servant this evening lord
[50:17] grant grace to the hearer to hear
[50:20] lord that your spirit will move
[50:21] powerfully among us to change our lives
[50:23] lord to draw us closer to you we pray
[50:26] lord remembering the many other services
[50:28] that will no doubt fire up this evening
[50:29] lord
[50:30] or remembering our youth that are at the
[50:32] camp in louisiana lord we pray
[50:34] especially for them lord but i know many
[50:36] services are going on this weekend lord
[50:38] may your holy spirit just draw in the
[50:40] lost lord may it sanctify us anew to
[50:42] your word lord may it fill us anew with
[50:44] your power lord that your life would
[50:46] live amongst us in a greater way that
[50:48] all could see it
[50:49] though we ask these things humbly in
[50:51] jesus name amen
[50:53] and amen god bless you
[50:55] man if you'll turn the scriptures to
[50:56] genesis chapter 2
[50:58] and then genesis chapter 2
[51:01] this evening as you're turning there
[51:03] it's uh
[51:05] been some time since i was up here
[51:06] somebody was asking me if i figured i'd
[51:08] remember how to do it
[51:10] i said i hope so
[51:12] amen but i just wanted to
[51:14] to say thank you for those certainly
[51:15] that that
[51:17] put the the time and effort into the
[51:18] special meetings while brother ed
[51:19] hammermeister was here i've talked to
[51:21] him many times since and he says his
[51:23] mind just keeps coming back to the
[51:24] weekend he had here and how much he
[51:26] enjoyed it and he just felt the kinship
[51:28] and the unity with the people here he he
[51:30] felt at home with us so that's uh that's
[51:33] the best thing i think that any ministry
[51:34] wants to hear is that people that come
[51:36] from other places that are believers are
[51:38] at home with us amen so i wanted to pass
[51:41] on not only my thanks and brother
[51:43] gerald's thanks for for those that
[51:45] attended and supported in in the
[51:46] services but also we had those that had
[51:49] a guest over that was unplanned maybe
[51:51] and and hosting fellowships and bringing
[51:54] meals and and doing all the things that
[51:55] you did so just thank you so much to
[51:58] each one of you that did that amen we
[51:59] will be having some special meetings in
[52:00] may also i discuss this with brother
[52:02] gerald a month or two ago and so we've
[52:04] got another minister coming in and we'll
[52:06] send out an announcement on that um soon
[52:09] with the details lord willing so amen
[52:11] genesis chapter two maybe a bit of an
[52:12] odd verse to start on easter weekend but
[52:15] uh
[52:16] but here goes nothing amen it says in
[52:18] the lord god planted a garden eastward
[52:20] in eden and there he put the man whom he
[52:22] had formed and out of the ground made
[52:24] the lord god to grow every tree that is
[52:26] pleasant to the sight and good for food
[52:29] the tree of life also in the midst of
[52:30] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[52:33] good and evil amen drop down to verse 16
[52:35] it says in the lord god commanded the
[52:36] man saying of every tree of the garden
[52:39] thou mayest freely eat but of the tree
[52:41] of the knowledge of good and evil thou
[52:43] shalt not eat of it for in the day that
[52:45] thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
[52:48] die let's turn ahead to genesis chapter
[52:50] 3
[52:52] and verse 22
[52:55] and the lord god said behold the man is
[52:57] become as one of us to know good and
[52:59] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[53:02] and take also of the tree of life and
[53:04] eat and live forever therefore the lord
[53:07] god sent him forth from the garden of
[53:09] eden to till the ground from whence he
[53:11] was taken
[53:12] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[53:14] the east of the garden of eden cherubims
[53:17] and a flaming sword which turned every
[53:19] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[53:22] and then god bless his word you may be
[53:24] seated this evening amen it's uh you
[53:27] know it's a commemorative weekend you
[53:29] know and we're we're certainly dwelling
[53:30] on the last few days of the life of
[53:32] christ and the events that happened over
[53:34] that special weekend and as i said maybe
[53:36] a bit of a a weird scripture to start
[53:38] with but when you look at what put them
[53:39] on the cross it goes no further than
[53:41] genesis amen happened almost immediately
[53:43] that they fell and so i wanted to start
[53:46] from there to see why it put him on the
[53:47] cross and i have to say i was getting a
[53:49] little nervous on sunday when brother
[53:51] mark was speaking because he kept
[53:52] walking all over the two sermons that
[53:54] the lord has laid on my heart for this
[53:56] weekend but i'm just trusting that's
[53:57] god's affirmation god's confirmation
[54:00] amen that he has a thought that he wants
[54:01] to get to the people amen so i want to
[54:03] take a a sermon tonight of of a title of
[54:06] it is finished and this one's been on my
[54:08] heart literally since last easter so
[54:10] i've been dwelling on this for quite
[54:12] some time and and uh just felt that if
[54:14] brother joe would ask me to preach then
[54:16] this is the one that we would preach but
[54:18] it's certainly changed a lot over the
[54:19] year as i've been dwelling on it so just
[54:21] trusting that god is in it amen but it's
[54:23] a heavy day this evening when we look
[54:25] back at this day and in history whenever
[54:27] it was that that christ was killed amen
[54:30] it was uh it was a friday night and and
[54:32] he had gone through so many things in
[54:34] the in the previous day you know and he
[54:36] hadn't just gone through great moments
[54:37] with the disciples but he'd gone through
[54:39] some some harrowing moments he'd gone
[54:41] through pain he'd gone through agony
[54:43] even before it ever started in terms of
[54:45] the physical pain that he was going to
[54:47] go through and he was in the garden of
[54:48] gethsemane and he's he's sweating as it
[54:51] were great drops of blood that's the
[54:52] agony that's going through is it's
[54:54] literally transforming him physically
[54:56] inside the agony of knowing what's
[54:58] coming his way amen but i think it's
[55:00] harder on us because we think it's we
[55:02] remember that it's us that put him there
[55:04] amen as we were singing there that it
[55:05] was my sins that caused those
[55:07] bloodstains amen that put him on the
[55:09] cross that held him to the whipping post
[55:11] that made him stand in the hall as he
[55:13] was falsely accused by one after another
[55:15] after another to stand there the perfect
[55:17] lamb of god that had no sin and yet to
[55:20] stay there and keep silent the entire
[55:22] time because he had to pay a price for
[55:24] me and he had to pay a price for you
[55:26] amen and sister maureen's saying that
[55:28] song during the special meetings how it
[55:30] behooves us not to forget the price that
[55:32] was paid amen every single day when
[55:34] we're making decisions really it needs
[55:36] to run through the price of or the idea
[55:38] of was this what he paid the price for
[55:40] the way that i'm living my life the
[55:42] decision that i'm making the things that
[55:43] i'm prioritizing in my life does that
[55:46] pay homage to the price that he paid or
[55:48] does it reflect a different inspiration
[55:50] in my life him am i doing it for some
[55:52] other reason because he wasn't dragged
[55:54] in front of people he wasn't spit on he
[55:56] wasn't punched he didn't have a crown of
[55:57] thorns placed on his head so that we
[55:59] could live a life of our own making amen
[56:01] but he called us to a place where we
[56:03] would surrender our lives to him and
[56:04] because of that he he willingly walked
[56:07] up to the where they nailed him to a
[56:09] cross and he held himself there amen he
[56:12] chose to endure that suffering amen he
[56:14] didn't have to he was built for it
[56:16] remember well i know when i spoke last
[56:18] last easter that we showed where brother
[56:20] brown said that he had a body that was
[56:21] built to take the beating amen none of
[56:24] us could have handled that in the flesh
[56:25] that we have in this sinful flesh we
[56:27] would not have have survived the beating
[56:29] and the whipping that he took but god
[56:31] made him a special body that could live
[56:34] long enough so that he could fulfill
[56:35] everything that was required to him in
[56:37] the scriptures and then he would give up
[56:39] his life willingly for the sake of us
[56:41] amen it ought to keep us so humble
[56:43] so gentle even
[56:45] when you think of him standing there
[56:48] right the lamb of god
[56:50] perfect sinless spotless he's been told
[56:53] he's been proven
[56:55] in the face of two or three witnesses
[56:57] that he was sinless and perfect and yet
[56:58] he opened not his mouth amen and how
[57:01] often we have to what raise our mouth
[57:03] open to what defend ourselves amen to to
[57:07] to try and put somebody down to try and
[57:09] put ourselves back to where we feel we
[57:11] ought to be amen our land nature is
[57:13] supposed to be coming from him amen the
[57:15] nature we have is supposed to be that of
[57:17] a lamb not a wolf what does a wolf do
[57:19] when it when it gets when it gets faced
[57:21] with difficulty it bears its teeth
[57:23] doesn't it it growls it snaps it barks
[57:25] at you but what does the lamb do the
[57:27] lamb just lays down and gives its life
[57:29] amen that's what it was that he did amen
[57:31] and it's something that we ought to be
[57:32] able to do
[57:34] in our lives amen but i want us to turn
[57:36] to john 19 if we would tonight because i
[57:38] want to look at the the last few moments
[57:40] of jesus life because when we look here
[57:43] we see a beautiful thing
[57:46] because it wasn't just jesus that died
[57:48] on that cross amen but it was the word
[57:49] that died and when we look at and when
[57:52] we look at
[57:53] christ as the word not just as a man not
[57:55] just as a body that's anointed with the
[57:57] spirit of god but when we look at it as
[57:59] the word we start to understand why
[58:00] jesus did the things he did amen that
[58:02] this was not just a man but this was the
[58:04] word and flesh walking amongst us amen
[58:07] it says in john 19 verse 28 it says
[58:10] after
[58:11] this jesus knowing that all things were
[58:13] now accomplished so in other words
[58:15] knowing that he had fulfilled everything
[58:18] of every part of every purpose that god
[58:20] had for him on this earth
[58:23] in terms of the great plan of redemption
[58:25] it says that the scriptures might be
[58:27] fulfilled saith i thirst so knowing that
[58:31] everything's done as far as he knows it
[58:33] needs to be done he says there's still
[58:35] one thing left that has to be fulfilled
[58:37] and he says i'm thirsty
[58:39] because what he looked in psalm 69 21
[58:42] and he saw where they had to give him
[58:44] the goal
[58:45] and so he said i thirst that doesn't
[58:46] mean he thirsts but it meant that the
[58:48] scripture had to be fulfilled and they
[58:50] had to give him that goal so even before
[58:53] he lays down his life the word is
[58:55] sitting there and saying the word still
[58:57] has to be fulfilled and that's what i'm
[58:59] focused on is the word being fulfilled
[59:01] in my life before i lay it down he had
[59:03] to finish that last prophecy before he
[59:06] could lay his life down that's how
[59:07] committed he was to the plan was he
[59:10] wanted to die no doubt many many hours
[59:12] many minutes before this he's going
[59:14] through great agony but yet he said the
[59:16] word has to be manifested in my life and
[59:18] there's one more thing i've got to do
[59:20] before i lay my life down it says now
[59:22] there was said a vessel full of vinegar
[59:24] and they filled a sponge with vinegar
[59:26] and put it upon hyssop and put it to his
[59:28] mouth now i want you to catch something
[59:30] here because they said that they used
[59:32] hyssop to give him the gall now we know
[59:35] that hyssop was used in the original
[59:36] passover to do what to apply the blood
[59:39] to the door nobody had to taste what was
[59:42] on the hyssop before amen but the blood
[59:44] that was placed on the hyssop was put
[59:46] over the door so that you didn't have to
[59:48] taste of the judgment of god so you
[59:50] didn't have to taste of the pain and
[59:51] suffering that was due you based on the
[59:53] sins that you had committed in that year
[59:56] right the the hyssop was used to apply
[59:58] the remedy to keep judgment off of you
[1:00:00] but now that the perfect sacrifice is
[1:00:03] there what is the hyssop doing now it's
[1:00:05] not laying off judgment but it is
[1:00:06] literally giving him a taste of what has
[1:00:09] been put off for for 4 000 years of
[1:00:11] people sinning and now he gets to taste
[1:00:13] what before was only pushing our sin
[1:00:15] away the hyssop brings to him what the
[1:00:17] gall the bitterness the pain the
[1:00:19] suffering that we should have been
[1:00:21] feeling all along and they put it to his
[1:00:23] mouth amen a man finally tasted what the
[1:00:25] blood had covered for so long is what's
[1:00:27] happening here it says and when jesus
[1:00:30] therefore have received the vinegar he
[1:00:32] said it is finished and he bowed his
[1:00:36] head
[1:00:37] and gave up the ghost
[1:00:40] he didn't die because his life left
[1:00:43] it says he gave up the ghost
[1:00:46] he gave it up willingly he let it
[1:00:48] separate from himself knowing that his
[1:00:51] purpose was finished and then knowing
[1:00:53] that he had done everything that god had
[1:00:55] called him to do he gave up the ghost
[1:00:58] and he laid his life down for you and i
[1:01:03] only after he fulfilled everything
[1:01:05] everything
[1:01:07] that the word had said about him
[1:01:09] up to that point would he lay his life
[1:01:12] down until then he would stay there and
[1:01:14] he would stay there and he would jared
[1:01:15] the antagony and he would endure the
[1:01:17] pain and he would endure the the
[1:01:19] suffering in the embarrassment he's
[1:01:20] naked on a cross
[1:01:22] naked on a cross no clothes like they
[1:01:24] paint they show in the in the movies and
[1:01:25] the paintings in the books he was stark
[1:01:28] naked in front of everybody
[1:01:30] right his bones were showing through his
[1:01:32] hands and his back where they whipped
[1:01:33] him and drove the nails through and yet
[1:01:35] he chose to stay there until the final
[1:01:38] thing was fulfilled that he was called
[1:01:39] to do and then and only then he said it
[1:01:43] is finished
[1:01:45] brother brahm said this he says that bee
[1:01:46] of death come down and circling around
[1:01:49] to sting him you know like any be it has
[1:01:51] a stinger in it but you know god
[1:01:54] prepared a flesh that time and it was
[1:01:56] the flesh of god he's drawing the
[1:01:58] distinction because if you and i were
[1:01:59] stung by that bee it had no effect on
[1:02:02] the bee but he says god had prepared a
[1:02:04] body god had prepared a flesh to treat
[1:02:06] this thing or a little differently
[1:02:08] and when that stinger once anchored in
[1:02:11] that son of god into a manual when he
[1:02:14] pulled himself out he had no stinger
[1:02:16] left amen death had sung so many people
[1:02:19] up to that but when he stung this flesh
[1:02:21] when he stung this man when he stung
[1:02:23] this body the stinger stuck
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] what he took the sting right out of
[1:02:28] death no wonder paul could say death
[1:02:31] where is thy sting grave where is thy
[1:02:33] victory but thanks be to god who gives
[1:02:36] us the victory through our lord jesus
[1:02:39] christ he says he could sting elijah and
[1:02:42] die he could sting elijah and remain
[1:02:45] with his singer but you know if a bee
[1:02:47] ever stings deep enough he can't sting
[1:02:49] no more he pulls his stinger out so
[1:02:51] there was no human flesh he could anchor
[1:02:54] in oh my no one he could anchor in but
[1:02:56] when he put it in emmanuel that time he
[1:02:59] lost his stinger thanks be to god yes
[1:03:01] sir he failed on that one
[1:03:04] amen but i don't want to focus tonight
[1:03:06] on the pain and the suffering
[1:03:08] amen we're so thankful for that but what
[1:03:10] is the point of focusing on that if we
[1:03:12] don't realize the effect of all of that
[1:03:14] pain and suffering amen so tonight i
[1:03:16] want to focus on why he did it why did
[1:03:19] he go and endure the day of suffering
[1:03:21] and pain and embarrassment and all these
[1:03:23] things why did he hold himself to that
[1:03:25] whipping post amen he's sitting there
[1:03:27] and he's got the first lash and he knows
[1:03:30] 39 more are coming and that first one
[1:03:33] was agony and he says i've got a stick
[1:03:34] for the next 39 and he wills himself to
[1:03:37] go through it what i did to do it
[1:03:40] paul says this and i know i read this
[1:03:42] last last easter but it's a beautiful
[1:03:43] scripture in hebrews 12 it says
[1:03:45] wherefore seem we are compassed about
[1:03:47] with so great a cloud of witnesses let
[1:03:49] us lay aside every weight and the sin
[1:03:52] which does so easily beset us and let us
[1:03:54] run with patience the race that is set
[1:03:56] before us looking under jesus the author
[1:03:59] and finisher of our faith
[1:04:02] where are you in this scripture
[1:04:04] jesus is the author and the finisher of
[1:04:06] our faith
[1:04:07] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:04:10] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:04:13] and has set down at the right hand of
[1:04:15] the throne of god for consider him that
[1:04:18] endured such contradiction that means
[1:04:20] such opposition and rebellion
[1:04:23] of sinners against himself lest ye be
[1:04:26] weary than faint in your minds now i
[1:04:27] want you to catch something there
[1:04:29] because he says christ was facing
[1:04:31] opposition and rebellion from what those
[1:04:33] who he was trying to help
[1:04:37] the ones he came to die for were the
[1:04:39] ones that put them there and the ones
[1:04:40] that called out against them
[1:04:42] and he's dying for their sake and
[1:04:44] they're the ones that are giving them
[1:04:45] the hardest time and then paul says you
[1:04:47] guys have to remember the same thing
[1:04:49] because otherwise you're going to get
[1:04:50] what weary and faint in your minds why
[1:04:53] because there's those that we're trying
[1:04:55] to help and guess what they're in
[1:04:56] opposition they're in rebellion to us
[1:04:58] they're thankless they're loveless they
[1:05:00] lack appreciation they don't understand
[1:05:02] what you're doing for them and if you've
[1:05:04] been a parent for any time at all you'll
[1:05:06] recognize that in your own children many
[1:05:07] times is that you're laying down your
[1:05:09] life for your children if you're a child
[1:05:11] of god and they often don't realize
[1:05:13] what's going on and especially as they
[1:05:14] get into their teen years what is it
[1:05:16] they start to what reject the love and
[1:05:18] the grace that you're showing them
[1:05:20] because they don't understand what's
[1:05:21] going on he says you can't get weary in
[1:05:23] your minds when you're doing this
[1:05:24] because you're going to face opposition
[1:05:26] just like christ did amen and because if
[1:05:29] you want the same results you've got to
[1:05:30] go through the same holocritics you've
[1:05:32] still got to go through the trial you've
[1:05:33] got to go through the tribulations and
[1:05:35] so often it's easier for us to focus on
[1:05:37] what the the shame and and the the the
[1:05:40] despising that jesus went through
[1:05:42] because that's what we have things that
[1:05:43] we're going through that don't feel so
[1:05:45] good but my challenge tonight is ask is
[1:05:47] can we be identified in the joy that
[1:05:49] took him through the pain and suffering
[1:05:51] i mean not just for what he did but in
[1:05:53] what we're doing ourselves and what god
[1:05:55] has placed in our lives in the trials
[1:05:57] and tribulations that we go through can
[1:05:59] we look through it with eyes of joy to
[1:06:01] see that there's a bigger picture than
[1:06:02] where i'm standing today in the
[1:06:04] condition that i'm in where my family is
[1:06:06] where my marriage is where my finances
[1:06:08] is where my career is where my walk with
[1:06:10] god is where my faith is
[1:06:12] can we see that where there's a lack yet
[1:06:14] we've got to look with joy to see that
[1:06:16] there's something beyond it and there's
[1:06:18] a bigger picture amen
[1:06:21] amen i think that we ought to have the
[1:06:22] spirit of christ on us that is focused
[1:06:24] on as jesus was on understanding that
[1:06:26] there's a joy that lies ahead that makes
[1:06:28] everything we're going through worth it
[1:06:30] amen because he saw beyond what he was
[1:06:32] doing to see what lay beyond and it was
[1:06:35] you and i with him
[1:06:37] right it wasn't just us and it wasn't
[1:06:39] just him but it was two of us together
[1:06:41] amen standing together in glory amen
[1:06:45] amen we need to recognize we're in the
[1:06:47] purifying fire
[1:06:48] that's where we are today
[1:06:50] i counsel of thee to buy of me gold
[1:06:52] tried in the fire amen revelation 3
[1:06:55] that's in the laodicean church age those
[1:06:57] that come out of it they're going to be
[1:06:58] purified aren't they
[1:07:00] james 1
[1:07:01] says my brethren counted all joy when
[1:07:04] you fall into divers temptations let me
[1:07:06] stop there he says different temptations
[1:07:09] different kinds of temptations let me
[1:07:10] say this if you're going through the
[1:07:12] same one over and over again you haven't
[1:07:13] learned the lesson and that's why you
[1:07:15] keep going through it
[1:07:16] but when you go through different ones
[1:07:18] what does that show that shows that
[1:07:19] you're growing that shows that god is
[1:07:21] maturing you and he's taking you through
[1:07:23] these different things to show you
[1:07:24] what's in you to show you where you're
[1:07:26] lined up with the word and to show you
[1:07:28] where you need to line up with the word
[1:07:29] to draw you to the place where you can
[1:07:31] see the word coming out of you as you go
[1:07:33] through these trials and temptations
[1:07:35] verse 3 says knowing this that the
[1:07:37] trying of your faith works patience
[1:07:41] faith doesn't
[1:07:42] doesn't uh generate immediate results
[1:07:44] can i say it that way it says what the
[1:07:47] trying of your faith works patience so
[1:07:49] often we think i don't have faith
[1:07:51] because the result is not immediate the
[1:07:53] scripture didn't say that if you had
[1:07:55] faith it was immediate it said if you
[1:07:57] have faith it's going to happen but the
[1:07:59] timing is always in god's hands amen but
[1:08:01] it says what that faith work is patience
[1:08:04] and then he says but let face patience
[1:08:06] have her perfect work not faith have
[1:08:08] ever perfect worth work but but patience
[1:08:12] because patience is god the proving of
[1:08:14] your faith do you have what you say you
[1:08:17] have
[1:08:18] right it's not the immediacy of the
[1:08:19] results that proves the faith but
[1:08:21] whether you stay there until you get the
[1:08:22] results that god has laid on your heart
[1:08:23] to believe for
[1:08:24] amen let patience have a perfect work
[1:08:27] that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:08:29] wanting nothing i mean this is the joy
[1:08:31] that is set before us is that if we go
[1:08:33] through trials and temptations if we
[1:08:35] pass the testing of god then what waits
[1:08:38] for us is a maturity and a perfection
[1:08:40] that is entire and complete and lacking
[1:08:42] nothing
[1:08:43] as a body
[1:08:45] amen not one of us is going to be
[1:08:46] perfect and entire in terms of the
[1:08:48] entire word of god because we're still
[1:08:50] in these these two-thirds cursed bodies
[1:08:52] amen but as a body of the the bride of
[1:08:55] christ there's nothing going to be
[1:08:56] lacking
[1:08:58] right whether it's gifts whether it's
[1:09:00] whether it's ministries whether it's
[1:09:01] love joy peace all of these things it is
[1:09:03] all going to be available to the bride
[1:09:05] amen there's nothing lacking in her
[1:09:08] it says in verse 12 blessed is the man
[1:09:10] that endureth temptation for when he has
[1:09:12] tried he shall receive the crown of life
[1:09:15] which the lord hath promised to them
[1:09:16] that love him let no man say when he is
[1:09:19] tempted i am tempted of god
[1:09:21] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:09:24] neither tempteth he any man
[1:09:26] but every man is tempted when he is
[1:09:28] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[1:09:31] and then when lust hath conceived it
[1:09:33] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[1:09:36] finished bringeth forth death now he's
[1:09:38] pointing us back to what the original
[1:09:39] sin in eden which we just we read the
[1:09:41] effect of at the beginning of the
[1:09:42] service amen but it's he's reminding us
[1:09:45] if you're dealing with death you can
[1:09:46] trace it back to sin every time
[1:09:49] now you say well what is death we're not
[1:09:51] just looking to end of life but what is
[1:09:53] sickness but the death of health
[1:09:55] amen that is just something that is
[1:09:57] supposed to be in its fullness and its
[1:09:59] maturity and it's not why because it's
[1:10:01] dying because of what unbelief amen we
[1:10:04] we have uh sickness in our body because
[1:10:06] we're in bodies that are full of
[1:10:08] unbelief we're in a fallen condition
[1:10:09] amen and so we're being restored to a
[1:10:11] place and we'll get into this more
[1:10:13] tomorrow evening or tomorrow morning or
[1:10:15] sunday morning lord willing where the
[1:10:17] body is now going to respond to the very
[1:10:18] life of god that is within you but in
[1:10:20] the meantime we're dealing with death in
[1:10:22] our lives death in our bodies death in
[1:10:24] our relationships and all he's doing is
[1:10:26] trying to bring us back to where life is
[1:10:28] and then when he died it was allowing us
[1:10:30] to have access now to that tree of life
[1:10:32] that have been guarded by those flaming
[1:10:34] swords for so long
[1:10:36] amen
[1:10:37] what inevitably when we look at these
[1:10:39] things we find unbelief sitting at the
[1:10:41] bottom because that's what sin is amen
[1:10:43] sometimes god is letting things go
[1:10:44] downhill so that we can see there's a
[1:10:46] root of unbelief waiting at the bottom
[1:10:48] of what we're dealing with right and
[1:10:50] he's trying to get us to see you haven't
[1:10:52] accepted my word for that spot in your
[1:10:54] life you haven't opened that door in
[1:10:55] your life to me and because of that
[1:10:57] there's going to be a root of unbelief
[1:10:58] and it's going to bring death in that
[1:11:00] situation until you open the door and
[1:11:02] let the word come in amen
[1:11:04] amen it's so tiring sometimes isn't it
[1:11:07] when you're going through trials when
[1:11:08] you're going through temptations and it
[1:11:10] seems there's no end like i said jesus
[1:11:12] standing there at the whipping post so
[1:11:14] no doubt he slumped after the first one
[1:11:16] right that's a cat of nine tails it's
[1:11:18] got metal on the end that digs into the
[1:11:20] flesh and when he was done he was more
[1:11:21] marred he was more
[1:11:23] disfigured than any man in history
[1:11:25] and the first one comes down and he
[1:11:27] knows there's another 39 because he
[1:11:28] knows the scriptures he knows he's got
[1:11:31] to take the 40 lashes amen and sometimes
[1:11:33] we're sitting there and we're on lash
[1:11:35] number one
[1:11:36] lash number two
[1:11:38] and what is it it's god just stripping
[1:11:39] us down
[1:11:41] breaking us down because what this has
[1:11:43] to die
[1:11:44] this has to die amen we're buried with
[1:11:47] christ but we're not just buried with
[1:11:48] him because he died but we've got to die
[1:11:50] ourselves amen and i don't want to get
[1:11:51] into my sermon for the next time too
[1:11:52] much but we've got to have this that
[1:11:55] dies
[1:11:55] and then it's got to die out completely
[1:11:57] so that he can spring up the newness of
[1:11:59] life
[1:12:00] amen we have to be able like christ to
[1:12:02] enter into the into these things
[1:12:03] willingly
[1:12:04] amen and not saying lord give me a trial
[1:12:08] but when the trial comes
[1:12:10] saying lord show me what your purpose
[1:12:13] and your plan is here and let me walk
[1:12:14] through it graciously trusting you in
[1:12:16] everything that comes my way
[1:12:18] ephesians 2 says for we are his
[1:12:20] workmanship
[1:12:22] workmanship
[1:12:23] not just the creation
[1:12:25] amen we're a new creation we're a new
[1:12:27] creature but there is a working that's
[1:12:29] going on to bring us to what we are
[1:12:31] that means he's got to mold us he's got
[1:12:33] to shape us
[1:12:35] right we are created in christ jesus
[1:12:37] unto good works
[1:12:39] which god had before ordained that we
[1:12:41] should walk in them
[1:12:43] that ought to make us show
[1:12:45] that we were what before ordained that
[1:12:47] we should walk in good works right not
[1:12:49] of myself not of yourself
[1:12:51] but he chose us to walk in good works
[1:12:54] wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:12:56] times past gentiles in the flesh who are
[1:12:58] called uncircumcision by that which is
[1:13:00] called the circumcision in the flesh
[1:13:02] made by hands that at that time ye were
[1:13:04] without christ being aliens from the
[1:13:06] commonwealth of israel strangers from
[1:13:08] the covenants of promise having no hope
[1:13:10] and without god in this world now i
[1:13:13] don't identify so much with this
[1:13:14] scripture being raised in the message
[1:13:15] the way i have but i think the brother
[1:13:17] mark and brother bob and these ones that
[1:13:19] were just walking around pure heathens
[1:13:21] would you say brother mark really pure
[1:13:23] heathens you know catholic but having no
[1:13:25] idea of who and what god was and all of
[1:13:28] a sudden he walks down and he touches
[1:13:30] you on the shoulder and he says hey
[1:13:33] listen
[1:13:34] and your and your ear
[1:13:35] over and you say what's that
[1:13:38] why that sounds awfully good
[1:13:41] that sounds like home
[1:13:43] and you didn't even know you had a
[1:13:45] different home
[1:13:46] right what was it it was god stepping
[1:13:48] down to you who were aliens
[1:13:50] if this was a weight loss program this
[1:13:53] would be the before picture
[1:13:54] right it says you are aliens strangers
[1:13:57] from the covenants of promise having no
[1:13:59] hope and without god in this world now
[1:14:01] listen if you're raised in the message
[1:14:02] you're no different than that until you
[1:14:05] come to a new birth you are exactly that
[1:14:07] right because we're all aliens until we
[1:14:09] get the new birth
[1:14:11] but amen there are those here that have
[1:14:12] been completely outside of it that had
[1:14:14] no identification with the message and
[1:14:16] god dropped down and he touched them in
[1:14:17] a special way and here we stand today at
[1:14:19] church because of it right
[1:14:22] that what
[1:14:23] but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes
[1:14:26] were far off
[1:14:28] sitting in that pew i was afar off
[1:14:31] far far far off and looking to get
[1:14:33] further away until he came and put his
[1:14:36] finger on my heart
[1:14:37] and said no you're not allowed to do
[1:14:39] that you're going to come with me and i
[1:14:40] said okay
[1:14:43] because why
[1:14:44] he touched me
[1:14:46] he came and talked to me and it wasn't
[1:14:48] just words on a page then
[1:14:49] it wasn't just message doctrine
[1:14:52] it was god knocking and saying hey
[1:14:55] time to walk with me
[1:14:56] i said okay
[1:14:58] recognized i was a son
[1:15:00] amen but now in christ jesus ye who
[1:15:02] sometimes were far off are made nigh by
[1:15:06] the blood of christ amen hallelujah
[1:15:08] thank you for that lord
[1:15:10] for he is our peace who had made both
[1:15:12] one and had broken down the middle wall
[1:15:14] of partition between us having abolished
[1:15:17] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:15:19] commandments contained in ordinances for
[1:15:21] to make in him in himself of two one new
[1:15:24] man so making peace
[1:15:26] that he might reconcile both unto god in
[1:15:29] one body by the cross having slain the
[1:15:32] enmity thereof that literally means when
[1:15:35] he says slain the enmity it literally
[1:15:36] means he killed the hatred and destroyed
[1:15:39] the cause of separation
[1:15:41] that's what christ did at calvary was he
[1:15:43] killed what separated us from god
[1:15:46] that's an amazing thing
[1:15:48] god could not breach that barrier
[1:15:50] remember there were flames there were
[1:15:52] swords of flame guarding the way to the
[1:15:54] tree of life nothing could pass
[1:15:56] and then he says christ killed the thing
[1:15:58] that was between us
[1:16:00] and came and preached peace to you who
[1:16:02] were afar off that's you and i
[1:16:04] and to them that were nigh that's the
[1:16:06] jews for through him we both have access
[1:16:09] by one spirit unto the father that's the
[1:16:11] new birth now therefore ye are no more
[1:16:14] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:16:16] citizens with the saints and of the
[1:16:18] household of god and are built upon the
[1:16:21] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:16:23] jesus christ himself being the chief
[1:16:25] cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:16:27] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[1:16:30] holy temple in the lord in whom ye also
[1:16:33] are builded together for inhabitation of
[1:16:36] god through the spirit if we were
[1:16:38] talking about a weight loss program this
[1:16:40] is the after picture amen that you are
[1:16:42] what built together
[1:16:44] not built singly
[1:16:46] not built singly remember i've said it
[1:16:48] before that thing that brother paul
[1:16:49] haylett said that stuck with me he said
[1:16:51] a sheep by itself is called only one
[1:16:53] thing in the scriptures and that is lost
[1:16:55] remember we are built together for
[1:16:58] inhabitation of god through one thing
[1:17:00] and one thing alone the holy spirit
[1:17:03] amen
[1:17:05] so when jesus christ said those words it
[1:17:07] is filled it is finished he fulfilled
[1:17:10] the payment for the sins of humanity and
[1:17:12] paved a way for us to where god can now
[1:17:14] dwell once again with humanity amen and
[1:17:17] what the blood of christ covers all of
[1:17:19] our sin brother gerald read this in the
[1:17:21] one of the the recent services in first
[1:17:23] john 1 he said and these things we write
[1:17:25] we unto you that your joy may be full
[1:17:28] remember we're looking through eyes of
[1:17:29] joy to what's waiting for us he says so
[1:17:32] then is this then is the message which
[1:17:34] we have heard of him and declare unto
[1:17:36] you that god is light and in him is no
[1:17:39] darkness at all
[1:17:41] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:17:43] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:17:46] not the truth didn't say believe it not
[1:17:48] he says we don't do it
[1:17:50] but if we walk in the light
[1:17:52] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[1:17:55] one with another and the blood of jesus
[1:17:57] his son cleanses us from all sin prophet
[1:18:00] of god says it this way he says but
[1:18:02] christ the kinsman redeemer has made a
[1:18:04] way of escape for every believer on this
[1:18:07] earth today
[1:18:08] so there's no excuse for us
[1:18:10] there's no reason to doubt there's no
[1:18:12] reason to worry there's no reason to
[1:18:14] fear he says he's made a way for all of
[1:18:16] us i can point yonder to calvary where
[1:18:19] god himself was made flesh when he held
[1:18:21] the stinger of death and took my place
[1:18:23] as a sinner and paid the price and he
[1:18:25] laid out the welcome mat to me to come
[1:18:28] home
[1:18:30] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:18:32] from the fountains of the water of life
[1:18:34] freely and he that comes in i will in no
[1:18:38] wise cast out praise the lord amen he
[1:18:41] what lays out the welcome man for the
[1:18:43] returning son and daughter amen amen
[1:18:47] what is it he doesn't stand there you
[1:18:49] know so often we approach and maybe we
[1:18:51] haven't quite lived the way we ought to
[1:18:53] or we've we've slipped or something and
[1:18:54] we think he's standing there with arms
[1:18:56] crossed and chest out and glaring down
[1:18:58] at us
[1:19:00] is that what we see here
[1:19:03] what is it we have we have christ laying
[1:19:05] out a welcome mat for his child to come
[1:19:07] back he didn't say come to me as a
[1:19:09] believer he said come to me as a child
[1:19:11] and i'll turn you into a believer amen
[1:19:13] he doesn't say you know the church is
[1:19:15] not a place for perfect people to come
[1:19:16] it's for hurting people to come and to
[1:19:18] be turned into a mature bride amen he
[1:19:21] doesn't ask us to come in perfection he
[1:19:23] just asks us to come
[1:19:24] and he does the work right because if he
[1:19:27] calls you it's his work from start to
[1:19:28] finish we don't start it so we can't
[1:19:30] finish it and we can't do anything in
[1:19:32] the in between because it says as we
[1:19:34] read earlier that he is the author the
[1:19:37] start and the finisher of our faith
[1:19:40] so what is it he draws us to him he
[1:19:42] knocked down the wall of partition he
[1:19:44] killed the thing that separated us which
[1:19:46] was sin and unbelief amen he gave us
[1:19:48] clear access to him as it was in eden
[1:19:50] and now there's no angel guarding the
[1:19:52] tree of life in fact we have the
[1:19:54] opposite we have an angel of life
[1:19:56] pulling us to the tree of life
[1:19:58] right we have an angel of life we have
[1:19:59] an angel messenger in this age and he's
[1:20:01] saying what to john he says go and take
[1:20:03] the book go eat of the tree of life he's
[1:20:07] actually stopped he's not guarding it
[1:20:08] anymore but he's compelling you he's
[1:20:10] driving you he's pushing you to go and
[1:20:12] taste of that word of life which is
[1:20:14] christ amen
[1:20:15] brother brown says this he says look
[1:20:17] here it is i hope you get it just as
[1:20:20] sure as man is born of a woman he has to
[1:20:22] die it's just that sure if he's born of
[1:20:25] christ he's got to live he's got to live
[1:20:30] he can't help it he's got eternal life
[1:20:33] christ said he had now in that day god
[1:20:35] guarded the tree to keep them from
[1:20:37] getting it but now that swords turn
[1:20:39] right back the other way now running
[1:20:41] them right into the tree so that they
[1:20:43] will receive the life driving people
[1:20:46] hurting them up to the tree of life how
[1:20:48] marvelous
[1:20:49] amen that's what we heard in this age
[1:20:51] was the angel that tells john
[1:20:53] representing the bride go and take the
[1:20:55] book
[1:20:56] it hasn't been available
[1:20:58] it's available now go take it and eat it
[1:21:01] and eat it and eat it and eat it because
[1:21:03] it's yours
[1:21:04] you're a part of it
[1:21:06] but you got to eat it you can't just
[1:21:07] stand there looking at it amen
[1:21:09] then the prophet of god takes it one
[1:21:11] step further he says when he come and
[1:21:13] was made flesh and anchored the stinger
[1:21:15] of death and pulled it out where you and
[1:21:17] i can walk in the face of it death can't
[1:21:20] bother us hallelujah he says for every
[1:21:23] believer that's in christ jesus is
[1:21:26] perfected forever
[1:21:29] praise god
[1:21:31] perfected forever
[1:21:33] finished work
[1:21:34] we're in a body of time but it's a
[1:21:36] finished work because as soon as he said
[1:21:38] it was finished it opened the door for
[1:21:40] the planet redemption to start rolling
[1:21:42] downhill and once it starts rolling
[1:21:45] nothing can stop it satan can get there
[1:21:47] he can build walls he can build barriers
[1:21:48] he can try and stand in front of it and
[1:21:50] redemption flattens every one of it
[1:21:52] because the price has been paid and he
[1:21:54] has nothing that can hold it back now
[1:21:56] yeah he can he can't hold up our sins
[1:21:59] right god they don't even exist before
[1:22:01] the blood used to cover it
[1:22:03] so he couldn't see it through the blood
[1:22:05] now they don't even exist brother brahm
[1:22:06] says the revelation of justification is
[1:22:08] not that he can't see it it's that you
[1:22:11] didn't do it in the first place there is
[1:22:13] no record of it therefore you didn't do
[1:22:15] it in the first place so satan cannot
[1:22:17] stand there as an accuser of the
[1:22:18] brethren because god is saying i can't
[1:22:20] see anything and if i can't see anything
[1:22:22] it never existed because god can see
[1:22:24] everything except what sins that are
[1:22:26] under the blood amen amen this word of
[1:22:29] promise is what reminding us of the
[1:22:31] effect of christ's death on that cross
[1:22:33] and his resurrection that that that that
[1:22:36] sunday morning stands eternally
[1:22:38] right perfected forever brother brown
[1:22:40] says this he says now that super sign
[1:22:43] was a virgin born child that was to last
[1:22:45] forever an eternal sign and that child
[1:22:48] is not dead they killed him he died
[1:22:50] certainly the stinger of death killed
[1:22:52] him but god raised him up again and here
[1:22:55] he is after 2 000 years of all the
[1:22:57] hardships and locusts and palmer worms
[1:22:59] eating on it there is still a remnant of
[1:23:02] people that believe god
[1:23:04] and keep his word
[1:23:07] amen i fear we're getting to the point
[1:23:09] in the message where we believe god but
[1:23:11] we won't keep his word
[1:23:13] he says there'll be a bride
[1:23:17] number one
[1:23:18] two just as certain as i'm standing in
[1:23:20] this pulpit there'll be a bride that's
[1:23:23] washed in the blood of that lamb and
[1:23:25] that lamb will be living among them
[1:23:28] showing super signs of his resurrection
[1:23:30] after 2 000 years the same thing he did
[1:23:33] when he was here on earth he says i
[1:23:35] believe that amen amen amen this is
[1:23:38] because super saiyan 1962 brother
[1:23:40] branham is saying the super sign is not
[1:23:42] william branham
[1:23:44] he's saying the super sign is the life
[1:23:46] of christ in a multi-membered bride
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:49] that's where we're standing today isn't
[1:23:51] it
[1:23:52] it's got to be that place
[1:23:53] amen everything in the old testament
[1:23:55] pointed towards christ coming and christ
[1:23:57] dying but when he breathed his last plan
[1:24:00] his last breath the plan of redemption
[1:24:02] started moving forward and satan can't
[1:24:04] stop it now
[1:24:05] it's got to keep moving forward in
[1:24:07] matthew 27 jesus when he had cried again
[1:24:10] with the loud voice yielded up the ghost
[1:24:12] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:24:14] rent and twain from the top to the
[1:24:16] bottom and the earth did quake and the
[1:24:18] rocks rent
[1:24:20] now when jesus died and i i've seen so
[1:24:22] many people preach on this and i've
[1:24:24] heard brother branham preach on this and
[1:24:26] they look at this scripture and they say
[1:24:27] when he died the earth shook there was a
[1:24:29] great earthquake and the sun went dark
[1:24:31] and the veil was was torn from the top
[1:24:34] to the bottom showing that it was god
[1:24:36] tearing down that partition to show that
[1:24:38] he wasn't living behind there anymore
[1:24:40] that he was going to be moving into
[1:24:41] another veil amen but more often when we
[1:24:44] hear these things they say what that was
[1:24:46] the earth mourning that was the earth
[1:24:48] crying that was the earth letting us
[1:24:50] know that our creator had died and given
[1:24:52] his life for us
[1:24:54] and it was sorrow that shook
[1:24:56] but i want to read this quote because
[1:24:58] brother branham gives this in 1964 as
[1:25:00] part of his christmas message and we
[1:25:02] know that brother branham said that
[1:25:04] after the seals were opened my bible
[1:25:06] became a whole new book now i want you
[1:25:08] to listen to this because this oh i so
[1:25:10] loved this when i read it because it
[1:25:12] gave me a whole new appreciation of what
[1:25:14] happens when god gives you a revelation
[1:25:16] listen to this he says when the great
[1:25:19] shepherd was smitten that great sheep
[1:25:21] prophet when he was smitten back there
[1:25:23] he said it is finished and that minute
[1:25:26] as soon as this shepherd was smitten it
[1:25:28] was over sin is settled and there was no
[1:25:31] more sin
[1:25:33] they were clean the penalty was paid the
[1:25:36] believers whose names were written in
[1:25:37] the book of life predestinated from the
[1:25:40] foundation of the world it was finished
[1:25:42] that very minute that jesus said it was
[1:25:44] finished he that great shepherd had come
[1:25:47] for a sheep it was finished god's right
[1:25:49] hand was full from pulled from his bosom
[1:25:51] smitten
[1:25:54] then on easter he returned it what that
[1:25:57] hand and raised it up again to his bosom
[1:25:59] and it extended it down to you and i in
[1:26:02] the form of his word to redeem us back
[1:26:04] to the original garden from which sin
[1:26:06] took us
[1:26:07] the hidden secret of his great heart was
[1:26:10] revealed by a prophet shepherd
[1:26:13] no wonder listen to this this is what
[1:26:14] made me oh it was amazing he said no
[1:26:17] wonder the mountains jumped and shouted
[1:26:21] on that day no wonder the sun hit its
[1:26:23] face and screamed for
[1:26:25] joy
[1:26:27] no wonder all nature broke loose the
[1:26:30] wind shook the trees till they shook and
[1:26:32] shook and joyed and jumped they seen the
[1:26:34] prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem
[1:26:37] every name on the book of life and they
[1:26:40] seen that their own nature was redeemed
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:43] so it wasn't sadness that made them act
[1:26:46] that way the prophet says it was joy
[1:26:48] that made them act that way
[1:26:51] it was joy that made them shout it was
[1:26:53] joy that made them break into
[1:26:55] why because their nature was being
[1:26:57] redeemed back
[1:26:59] this is his proof he says they screamed
[1:27:01] and jumped and the world went into an
[1:27:03] earthquake the mountains rent the rocks
[1:27:05] fell out the sun went down and
[1:27:07] everything taken place
[1:27:09] he says like any meeting when the
[1:27:10] shepherd reveals to you it's finished
[1:27:13] i've seen jumping spells and joy spells
[1:27:16] but there was nobody hurt
[1:27:18] the mountains rung out the sun went down
[1:27:20] and everything took place but there was
[1:27:22] nobody hurt and i've seen meetings where
[1:27:25] the power of god was revealed to the
[1:27:27] people that they were free from the
[1:27:29] world and the things of the world and
[1:27:31] the joy of the lord fill the
[1:27:32] congregation they stood and screamed and
[1:27:36] cried and shouted to the top of their
[1:27:38] voice for the glory of god
[1:27:40] i never did see anything disorderly they
[1:27:43] was always right in order because they
[1:27:45] have recognized that their names that
[1:27:47] have been written on the lamb's book of
[1:27:49] life before the foundation of the world
[1:27:51] the great prophet shepherd had brought
[1:27:53] them the message and they were delivered
[1:27:56] the prophet shepherd no matter what the
[1:27:59] other ecclesiastical realm said about it
[1:28:01] they knew what had happened
[1:28:04] oh my that's why we shout that's why we
[1:28:07] scream that's why we dance that's why we
[1:28:10] raise our hands is because we know what
[1:28:13] has happened not what will happen what
[1:28:16] has already happened though i don't see
[1:28:19] anything i know it is a finished work
[1:28:21] amen that's why we shout is because
[1:28:24] we've received a revelation that it is
[1:28:27] finished
[1:28:28] just as them shepherds did back there
[1:28:31] they knowed what took place what is it
[1:28:34] nature itself bore witness of the
[1:28:36] redemption plan unfolding amen it
[1:28:38] testified that we were on the garden
[1:28:40] back to eden nature cried out that
[1:28:42] fellowship with god was restored even as
[1:28:44] that veil was torn what did it show
[1:28:46] anyone can come in you don't have to be
[1:28:48] a high priest you don't have to be a
[1:28:50] member of the ministry you don't have to
[1:28:51] be a member of this family this tribe
[1:28:53] this nation even everyone has access to
[1:28:56] that tree of life if they'll walk in the
[1:28:58] light as he is in the light amen and
[1:29:00] what do we have now the earth is
[1:29:01] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:29:03] sons of god
[1:29:04] it's not screaming for joy now it's
[1:29:06] saying the time is at hand isn't it
[1:29:08] that's what the scripture says that it's
[1:29:09] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:29:11] sons of god and what is it doing we see
[1:29:13] all these things happening they call it
[1:29:14] climate change you know what it is
[1:29:16] nature says what it won't be long
[1:29:19] we're ready for full redemption
[1:29:21] it's about that time get ready people
[1:29:24] remember jesus said how is it that you
[1:29:26] can't discern the times
[1:29:28] we look here and we see all these things
[1:29:29] happening we ought to see that nature is
[1:29:31] saint it won't be long soon we'll be
[1:29:33] going home amen
[1:29:36] brother bram said this he said sickness
[1:29:38] superstition and the devils had us
[1:29:40] pinned us down but there was no way out
[1:29:42] and the church had gone wrong they went
[1:29:44] off on denominational things and the
[1:29:46] pharisees and sadducees and washing of
[1:29:48] pots and pans
[1:29:50] that's how far their religion it got was
[1:29:52] they were worried about the washing of
[1:29:53] pots and pans if we get there brother we
[1:29:56] are a denomination
[1:29:59] and the word of god become of no effect
[1:30:02] but they'd sit there for days and and
[1:30:04] talk about it and and debate it and go
[1:30:06] back and forth and use message quotes to
[1:30:08] debate who's right and who's wrong
[1:30:09] wouldn't they
[1:30:11] that was the message for their day it
[1:30:12] was the law of the prophets and they'd
[1:30:14] sit there and they'd say i got a quote
[1:30:15] for this and i got a quote for that
[1:30:18] he says and what the word of god had no
[1:30:19] effect in their life
[1:30:21] but this little dove came down and
[1:30:24] there's only one thing that could take
[1:30:25] place there had to be a redeemer but
[1:30:28] being wounded broken beaten torn and he
[1:30:30] knowed his way back home so from
[1:30:32] calvary's cross where they bruised him
[1:30:34] mashed him tore him like a bunch of
[1:30:36] wolves upon him he made his flight from
[1:30:39] calvary and he landed in heaven's door
[1:30:41] saying it's finished it's finished they
[1:30:43] are free sickness can be healed now
[1:30:46] sinners can be saved the captive can be
[1:30:48] made can be set free what was it as we
[1:30:51] read in that quote earlier it was the
[1:30:52] hidden secret of his great heart being
[1:30:54] expressed nature was expressing it and
[1:30:56] now he was going to fall on sons and
[1:30:58] daughters of god to express the very
[1:30:59] same thing what is it the word expressed
[1:31:02] once more we have access now to the tree
[1:31:04] of life which is christ himself amen
[1:31:08] and what is it they had the word back
[1:31:10] then
[1:31:11] the word's always been there
[1:31:13] but now they had a living word
[1:31:15] that was a difference
[1:31:16] it was a living word not just living in
[1:31:18] on the pages but it was living in the
[1:31:20] life of a man and now it was coming down
[1:31:22] to a bride that he called out from his
[1:31:24] side
[1:31:24] he says we're trying to let the sinner
[1:31:26] know that god loves him and he's already
[1:31:29] saved him if he will just accept it it's
[1:31:32] the work that christ finished at calvary
[1:31:34] when he made that all-sufficient word
[1:31:36] saying it is finished the whole plan of
[1:31:38] salvation all that could be done for
[1:31:41] mankind by the heart of god was finished
[1:31:44] when christ said those words
[1:31:46] you want to add to it there's nothing
[1:31:47] more to add he says it is finished and
[1:31:50] when he said those words everything that
[1:31:51] god could ever do was finish god's plan
[1:31:54] was completed we just have to have faith
[1:31:57] to receive what he has finished for us
[1:32:01] i want to read a quote from the ephesian
[1:32:02] church age that's the first stage
[1:32:05] so this is after christ died he comes
[1:32:06] back of course we have we have the the
[1:32:08] folly of the holy spirit on on the day
[1:32:10] of pentecost and we see what the book of
[1:32:12] revelation says to them
[1:32:14] and it says to him that overcometh will
[1:32:16] i give to eat of the tree of life which
[1:32:17] is in the midst of the paradise of god
[1:32:19] he couldn't say this until christ had
[1:32:21] died
[1:32:22] because the way had to be made the price
[1:32:24] had to be paid
[1:32:25] he says what a thrilling thought this is
[1:32:27] that tree of life in the garden of eden
[1:32:29] which could not be approached unto
[1:32:31] because of the fall of adam is now given
[1:32:34] to the overcomer
[1:32:35] the flaming sword of the guardian
[1:32:37] cherubim has been sheathed but it was
[1:32:39] not sheathed er its blade was bloody
[1:32:41] with the blood of the lamb he says let
[1:32:43] us meditate
[1:32:45] upon this truth a while as we consider
[1:32:47] why the tree was denied to adam and his
[1:32:50] descendant descendants but now allowed
[1:32:52] again god's intention for his creation
[1:32:56] man is to express his words in genesis
[1:32:59] adam was given the word to live by a
[1:33:01] life lived by the word would be the word
[1:33:05] expressed
[1:33:06] i want to read that again a life lived
[1:33:09] by the word would be the word expressed
[1:33:13] that's our job
[1:33:15] that is true is it not but did adam live
[1:33:17] by that word no because he was to live
[1:33:19] by every word and he failed to take heed
[1:33:22] of every word then there arose moses
[1:33:24] what a great and mighty man he was yet
[1:33:26] he also failed to live by every word and
[1:33:28] that prophet the type of the great
[1:33:30] prophet to come failed in anger to obey
[1:33:33] the word there was also david the great
[1:33:35] king of israel a man after god's own
[1:33:37] heart he failed by adultery when he was
[1:33:39] tempted
[1:33:41] but eventually in the fullness of time
[1:33:43] there came one the head even jesus who
[1:33:46] also must be tempted to see if he would
[1:33:48] live by every word that proceedeth out
[1:33:50] of the mouth of god
[1:33:51] then was satan foiled for here was one
[1:33:53] who lived by it is written and that
[1:33:56] masterpiece of god overcame by
[1:33:58] reflecting god's word amen you want to
[1:34:00] overcome reflect god's
[1:34:02] word and then this was manifest then was
[1:34:05] this manifested perfect one given to the
[1:34:08] cross as the perfect lamb of god for the
[1:34:10] perfect sacrifice and on the tree he
[1:34:12] received the wounds unto death that we
[1:34:15] by him and because of him might eat of
[1:34:17] the tree of life and then that tree of
[1:34:19] life freely given would enable us to
[1:34:22] overcome and express the word of god
[1:34:25] but now to these sons of god who by him
[1:34:28] overcome are given the privilege of the
[1:34:31] paradise of god and the constant
[1:34:32] fellowship of jesus christ
[1:34:35] there will never more be any separation
[1:34:37] from him whither he goes his bribe will
[1:34:39] go what is his he shares with his
[1:34:42] beloved on a joint air relationship
[1:34:44] the secret things will be revealed the
[1:34:46] dark things will be made plain we shall
[1:34:48] know as we are known and we shall be
[1:34:51] like him this is the heritage of the
[1:34:53] overcomer who has overcome by the blood
[1:34:55] of the lamb and the word of testimony to
[1:34:58] jesus christ how we long for that day
[1:35:01] when the crooked roads will be all
[1:35:03] straightened
[1:35:04] along for that in my life
[1:35:07] the road's there
[1:35:08] it's got to be straightened out in here
[1:35:09] doesn't it
[1:35:10] praise the lord
[1:35:12] and we will be with him time without end
[1:35:14] may that day hasten its appearance and
[1:35:16] may we hasten to obey his word and
[1:35:19] thereby prove our worthiness to share
[1:35:22] his glory listen you have no worthiness
[1:35:24] in your in your righteousness and the
[1:35:26] things you do he says your worthiness is
[1:35:29] when we obey his word that's the only
[1:35:31] thing that makes you worthy that shows
[1:35:33] it doesn't make you worthy shows you
[1:35:35] worthy
[1:35:36] to share his glory he that hath an ear
[1:35:38] let him hear with the spirit say to the
[1:35:40] churches how tragic it is that this
[1:35:42] first age did not listen to the spirit
[1:35:44] instead it listened to man now listen to
[1:35:47] this he says but thank god in the last
[1:35:50] stage there will be a group rise up the
[1:35:52] true bride of the last day and she will
[1:35:55] listen to the spirit amen
[1:35:58] period
[1:36:00] not occasionally
[1:36:02] not once or twice
[1:36:04] she will listen to the spirit
[1:36:07] in that day of gross darkness the light
[1:36:10] will return by the pure word and we will
[1:36:12] return to the power of pentecost to
[1:36:15] welcome back the lord jesus
[1:36:18] i like what brother gerald said the
[1:36:19] other day i believe brother ed mentioned
[1:36:20] it as well when he was here we're going
[1:36:22] back to the power of the pentecostal
[1:36:24] church but we do not have the same
[1:36:26] message
[1:36:28] because theirs was they go under the
[1:36:30] world and preach all the gospel with
[1:36:31] signs and wonders following but our
[1:36:33] message it's not that the signs and
[1:36:35] wonders are not supposed to follow
[1:36:36] brother brown made that very clear that
[1:36:38] never went away and it was very evident
[1:36:40] in his ministry and we see it going on
[1:36:42] but we don't see it as the major focus
[1:36:44] amen why because the word is here right
[1:36:47] it was to draw people to that word the
[1:36:49] words here now we're moving on from that
[1:36:51] but what our we have the same power but
[1:36:53] our anointing is to overcome
[1:36:55] and is to overcome as we heard here by
[1:36:57] obeying every word that is the overcomer
[1:37:00] in this age is that they will live by
[1:37:01] every word again amen what we've we've
[1:37:04] heated the voice
[1:37:05] we've gotten ourselves out of
[1:37:06] denomination and i'll say it again if
[1:37:08] you're sitting in here and saying that
[1:37:10] this is what gets me into heaven because
[1:37:12] i attend a message church you have made
[1:37:14] it a denomination that is not what gets
[1:37:16] you in but it's when he's knocking on
[1:37:17] your heart and you let him in that's
[1:37:19] when you get life inside amen and that's
[1:37:21] when you receive the new birth and
[1:37:23] that's when you move on with him amen so
[1:37:25] we must be outside of all influences all
[1:37:27] groups all denominations all ministries
[1:37:30] that would try and do what make the word
[1:37:31] of god ineffective in our life listen
[1:37:34] the minute a minister tries to make you
[1:37:36] do something he's making the word of god
[1:37:37] ineffective because the word has to have
[1:37:39] that effect not a man driving you to do
[1:37:41] it
[1:37:41] amen that's where legalism crept into
[1:37:44] the message was they said you got to
[1:37:45] listen to me or else and what they may
[1:37:48] have been right every time but that's
[1:37:49] not wakes that makes a believer live
[1:37:51] they live by the life of christ in them
[1:37:53] which is the holy spirit amen
[1:37:55] what is it like enoch we're going to
[1:37:56] have an enoch anointing and that's that
[1:37:58] we we have one revelation before we go
[1:38:00] and it's that we please god
[1:38:03] why because he's walking with us he's
[1:38:06] talking with us he's living in us his
[1:38:08] thoughts are our thoughts his ways are
[1:38:10] our ways
[1:38:11] right we've died and he's alive
[1:38:13] right and we're gonna understand hey i'm
[1:38:16] just like he is
[1:38:17] and that's when we have that adoption
[1:38:18] time that final adoption the great
[1:38:20] adoption if i could put it that way what
[1:38:22] is it because at that time we recognize
[1:38:24] we are him
[1:38:25] right he's in us in the same fullness as
[1:38:27] a body as he was in christ when he was
[1:38:30] hearing man what am i getting at here
[1:38:32] i'm telling you that what jesus christ
[1:38:34] went through all the way to calvary was
[1:38:36] for one thing that was the set in motion
[1:38:38] a redemption plan that would bring you
[1:38:40] back to god just like it was in the
[1:38:41] beginning
[1:38:42] to where you don't have a barrier
[1:38:44] between you and god
[1:38:45] right where you're not praying into a
[1:38:47] brass ceiling
[1:38:49] where you can speak and you know that he
[1:38:51] hears
[1:38:52] where you can ask and know that he has
[1:38:54] answered
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:55] not in your time but in his time but you
[1:38:58] know he's answered and even as a
[1:39:00] even as uh her brother ron say this
[1:39:02] morning that when god answers it's
[1:39:04] always good
[1:39:06] right meaning it's always right
[1:39:08] you may get an answer different than
[1:39:09] what you asked for but it's always right
[1:39:11] the way he answers amen
[1:39:13] listen nothing can stop this plan
[1:39:17] it's finished
[1:39:18] it's finished we're just in this body of
[1:39:20] time proving what
[1:39:22] ourselves
[1:39:23] our character our nature dying out we're
[1:39:26] going to take the character we develop
[1:39:27] here and it's going to go with us in our
[1:39:28] theophany bodies that's how that's the
[1:39:30] kind of character the bride's going to
[1:39:32] have
[1:39:32] is that it can go with her because it's
[1:39:34] the only part of god that's in her when
[1:39:36] she's here but let me say this even your
[1:39:38] lack of faith won't stop god's program
[1:39:42] amen i can prove it by the word
[1:39:45] even your lack of faith your unbelief
[1:39:46] won't stop it your big mistakes your
[1:39:48] small mistakes your habits your secrets
[1:39:51] won't stop the plan of redemption
[1:39:54] because why he already said it's
[1:39:56] finished
[1:39:57] so you can't stop it because it's
[1:39:58] already done
[1:40:00] that's what he meant when he said it's
[1:40:01] finished it's done it's as good as done
[1:40:04] he's speaking from the mind of god when
[1:40:05] he does that we're in this body of time
[1:40:07] but it's already finished and jesus said
[1:40:09] i'm not going to lose a single one so if
[1:40:11] you are a child of god if you are a son
[1:40:13] of god if you are a daughter of god you
[1:40:15] cannot be lost
[1:40:17] there's no way i think brother mark
[1:40:18] mentioned it he says if god won't get
[1:40:20] you to do what he wants here he'll take
[1:40:21] you
[1:40:22] but he'll take you he doesn't give you
[1:40:24] over to satan he'll take you and he'll
[1:40:26] put you over there and you lose your
[1:40:27] reward but you don't lose your soul
[1:40:29] right he's not going to lose you no
[1:40:30] matter what you do amen the scripture
[1:40:32] says in romans 8 that what he says
[1:40:34] neither tribulation distress famine
[1:40:36] peril death life angels principalities
[1:40:38] and powers can't separate us from the
[1:40:39] love of god what makes you think that
[1:40:41] your lack of faith could stop it you can
[1:40:44] listen the faith that you have is of god
[1:40:46] anyways we'll get into it more in the
[1:40:48] next service but you can't even have
[1:40:49] faith unless god gives it to you
[1:40:51] not to walk off this planet that's for
[1:40:53] sure
[1:40:53] amen what faith comes by hearing which
[1:40:56] is understanding and understanding comes
[1:40:58] by the word of god so you can't even
[1:41:00] have faith until god gives you
[1:41:01] understanding what is it what do we call
[1:41:03] an understanding from god revelation so
[1:41:06] unless god reveals it to you you can't
[1:41:08] have faith in the first place
[1:41:09] right if you believe you've accepted his
[1:41:12] word you've obeyed his word and he's
[1:41:13] given you life by the holy spirit you
[1:41:15] can't stop yourself from making it right
[1:41:18] the eternal life of god in you cannot
[1:41:20] die
[1:41:21] amen right it's going to carry you all
[1:41:23] the way through we get so caught up in
[1:41:25] our mistakes and failures sometimes i
[1:41:26] know i do i'm probably my biggest critic
[1:41:29] because i'm a perfectionist i always
[1:41:31] want to be right i always want to be
[1:41:32] good i always want to have the right
[1:41:33] reaction and guess what i don't
[1:41:36] and so what happens is you start to say
[1:41:37] well where is the nature of christ in
[1:41:39] this situation why didn't i do it this
[1:41:40] way why didn't i do it that way and you
[1:41:42] start to beat yourself up amen
[1:41:45] but what i get caught up in looking at
[1:41:46] the circumstances in my reaction to him
[1:41:48] rather than saying that he said it's a
[1:41:50] finished work and he's going to get me
[1:41:52] there
[1:41:52] right one way or the other he's going to
[1:41:54] get me there
[1:41:55] listen i need further sanctification in
[1:41:57] my life and you do too if only to give
[1:41:59] more time and energy to the things of
[1:42:01] god it's not that you have bad things in
[1:42:02] your life it's that you've got to give
[1:42:04] more to him and that requires
[1:42:05] sanctification sanctification just means
[1:42:07] taking more out so that he can put more
[1:42:09] in that's really what we're looking at
[1:42:11] so when i'm lacking what do i do
[1:42:13] i go to god and i say i'm lacking
[1:42:15] i don't try and cover it up i don't try
[1:42:18] and hide in the shadows i don't try and
[1:42:19] say yeah but i have a wonderful i'm a
[1:42:21] minister
[1:42:23] i got it all
[1:42:24] no
[1:42:25] i don't have anything more than you do i
[1:42:28] got a gift to preach that's it a call to
[1:42:29] preach maybe not even a gift just a call
[1:42:31] by that i'm the same as everybody else
[1:42:34] right what is it we all have failures we
[1:42:36] all have faults we all have these little
[1:42:38] things that trip us up sometimes they're
[1:42:39] big things so i do as i go to god and i
[1:42:42] say god
[1:42:43] i've got a bad attitude
[1:42:45] i'm a natural cynic that doesn't play
[1:42:48] well with christianity
[1:42:49] right
[1:42:51] right i'm distrustful by nature
[1:42:54] so what do i do i go to god and i say
[1:42:56] god this ain't going to fly in the
[1:42:58] rapture
[1:42:59] you said it's finished
[1:43:01] you said i was going to be complete and
[1:43:03] entire and needing nothing
[1:43:05] so lord i'm coming to you
[1:43:08] and then it's up to him to do it not up
[1:43:09] to me to do it but it's up to me to stop
[1:43:12] pretending
[1:43:13] and go and say i have a need remember
[1:43:15] the zeal for the age for laodicea was
[1:43:18] one of repentance the prophet said what
[1:43:20] is it because they said i'm rich and
[1:43:22] increased with goods and have need of
[1:43:23] nothing
[1:43:24] that's their mindset is i've got it all
[1:43:26] and he says no you've got to repent and
[1:43:28] you've got to let me mold and shape you
[1:43:30] and beat you until the purity of the
[1:43:32] character of christ is inside of you so
[1:43:34] you've got in order to get to that place
[1:43:36] you've got to recognize i'm not where i
[1:43:38] ought to be
[1:43:39] not that i don't have the holy ghost not
[1:43:41] that i'm not a believer
[1:43:43] but that there's something has to be
[1:43:44] taken out to get to where we're going
[1:43:46] amen to get to purity everything in pure
[1:43:48] has to be taken out and listen we're
[1:43:50] full of it we're full of impurities i
[1:43:52] can say i am amen but listen i don't try
[1:43:54] and manufacture it why you can't
[1:43:56] manufacture the fruits of the holy
[1:43:58] spirit
[1:43:59] it just happens
[1:44:01] and it's got to be his life doing it not
[1:44:02] you because what you'll find is it'll
[1:44:04] work to a point and then you'll hit
[1:44:06] something that the that the human nature
[1:44:08] can't overcome and you'll fall down
[1:44:10] every time but it's when the
[1:44:11] supernatural is needed that's when
[1:44:13] you'll know you've got it amen
[1:44:15] amen i've got a hair i've got to bear
[1:44:17] the fruit of the holy spirit and that's
[1:44:18] by promise not by command
[1:44:20] and then i don't bring it on i don't
[1:44:21] turn it on i don't turn it off it just
[1:44:23] happens right and if it doesn't happen
[1:44:25] then i go to god and i say
[1:44:27] we need to talk
[1:44:29] we need to talk
[1:44:31] amen
[1:44:32] it's on him to supply my need it's up to
[1:44:34] me to confess i have a need
[1:44:37] amen
[1:44:38] all i'm doing is reminding him hey you
[1:44:39] said it's a finished work i'm not
[1:44:41] finished so let's get to the finishing
[1:44:43] party man
[1:44:44] brother bram said this
[1:44:47] jesus in his prayer said father i
[1:44:50] sanctify myself
[1:44:52] jesus becomes sanctified
[1:44:55] do the church to the church he could
[1:44:57] have gotten married but he didn't do it
[1:44:59] he become sanctified he said sanctify
[1:45:02] them father through the truth thy word
[1:45:04] is the truth now let's lay aside every
[1:45:07] weight
[1:45:08] now this is where we get personal
[1:45:10] you got a temper
[1:45:14] you got something about you makes you
[1:45:15] talk when you ought not to talk
[1:45:18] oh god he says lay it there now lay it
[1:45:21] there and watch the fire of the altar
[1:45:23] come down and take it away
[1:45:26] now watch what he says next he says
[1:45:28] watch the love of god
[1:45:31] lick it up
[1:45:32] because we think it's this destructive
[1:45:34] power
[1:45:35] right that he consumes it and rips it
[1:45:37] out of your life but brother brahm says
[1:45:39] it's the love of god that will destroy
[1:45:41] it in your life amen when the love of
[1:45:43] god is shed abroad in your heart
[1:45:44] remember brother branham said when
[1:45:46] somebody does you wrong and they've just
[1:45:48] they've done you wrong
[1:45:49] like you justly know
[1:45:51] you know that they did you wrong
[1:45:54] he says you go into your prayer closet
[1:45:56] he says and you pray until god gives you
[1:45:59] a revelation of why they did it he said
[1:46:01] and then you'll feel sorry for that
[1:46:02] brother or sister and you'll pray for
[1:46:04] them to come back to where they need to
[1:46:05] be
[1:46:06] that's when the love of god licks it up
[1:46:08] as opposed to i sit there and try and
[1:46:09] manufacture forgiveness
[1:46:11] amen
[1:46:12] he says watch all that old selfishness
[1:46:15] the way you've been talking to your wife
[1:46:17] the way you've been talking to your
[1:46:18] husband the way you've been talking to
[1:46:19] your neighbor the way you've talked
[1:46:21] about the people in the church lay it
[1:46:23] all on the altar this morning and the
[1:46:25] fire of god will come down and take it
[1:46:27] right away and divine love will burn in
[1:46:30] its place that's what i want love
[1:46:34] he said you can have all of this
[1:46:38] but he says not but perfect love can
[1:46:40] enter there
[1:46:42] all this
[1:46:44] listen
[1:46:45] i know people that have all this
[1:46:47] in this church
[1:46:50] how many of us have that
[1:46:52] i believe we've got people in this
[1:46:53] church have that too but this is the
[1:46:55] great separator because it takes the
[1:46:57] holy spirit together
[1:46:58] you can do all of this
[1:47:01] you can walk this walk
[1:47:03] you can there's plenty of denominational
[1:47:05] believers that i can point to that have
[1:47:06] this sort of a life how many have this
[1:47:09] you can't do that one without the holy
[1:47:10] spirit that's where the new birth comes
[1:47:11] in and takes us to that point amen
[1:47:14] amen
[1:47:15] i like
[1:47:17] yeah
[1:47:19] divine love will burn this place he says
[1:47:21] you've got sickness
[1:47:22] lay it on the altar and say lord here it
[1:47:24] is create in me a clean heart create in
[1:47:27] me a healing power and see what god will
[1:47:29] do god will do it this morning i like
[1:47:32] what brother gerald said
[1:47:33] i asked him after the service last last
[1:47:35] time he preached he said faith will work
[1:47:37] out what god has worked in
[1:47:39] and i said where did you get that he
[1:47:42] said that's mine
[1:47:43] came from me that was the lord that's
[1:47:45] what it was that was one of the most
[1:47:47] amazing things i've heard from anybody
[1:47:49] in a long time faith will work out what
[1:47:52] god has worked in a man we want faith to
[1:47:54] move mountains sometimes listen to this
[1:47:57] because we're believers
[1:48:00] you know who told somebody to do
[1:48:02] something because they were a believer
[1:48:05] satan
[1:48:07] if thou be the son of god do so and so
[1:48:10] and you know what satan comes in and
[1:48:12] he'll tempt us and he'll say you're a
[1:48:13] believer you should do this
[1:48:16] you should do that
[1:48:17] you should be here you should be there
[1:48:19] that's not the spirit of god in you
[1:48:21] right when the spirit of god comes in it
[1:48:23] raises up a standard it points you to
[1:48:24] the word and it gives you a faith to act
[1:48:26] on it but if we start doing things
[1:48:28] because we're believers and we're
[1:48:29] supposed to do it that has nothing to do
[1:48:31] with the holy spirit moving in our life
[1:48:32] we are supposed to move by inspiration
[1:48:34] remember brother branham said with about
[1:48:36] the bride he said she will have the word
[1:48:38] and she'll know what to do with it and
[1:48:41] she will have dust saith the lord or she
[1:48:43] will hold her peace she'll stay quiet
[1:48:45] right so we don't do things because
[1:48:47] we're believers amen we have faith as we
[1:48:49] have revelation so unless god reveals it
[1:48:52] to you it's just a hope
[1:48:54] whatever you're believing for whatever
[1:48:55] you're asking for whatever you're
[1:48:57] looking for it's hope until god does it
[1:48:59] and we can believe till we're blue in
[1:49:00] the face and it won't make a lick of
[1:49:02] difference
[1:49:03] right you don't put old wine and new
[1:49:05] bottles the scripture says now these
[1:49:07] days you know if i i looked at the wine
[1:49:08] bottles there for communion they're
[1:49:10] glass that doesn't make sense to us
[1:49:12] today but in the old days what did you
[1:49:13] carry your wine in it was a skin it was
[1:49:16] an animal skin and so they put new wine
[1:49:18] in new skin
[1:49:19] because the skin would stretch
[1:49:22] as the wine expended as it aged
[1:49:25] but if you put new wine in an old skin
[1:49:27] what happens with an old skin is it
[1:49:28] loses its flexibility
[1:49:30] older sisters and brothers listen up
[1:49:33] we lose flexibility as we get old don't
[1:49:35] we
[1:49:36] not just naturally either
[1:49:38] right he says you can't put
[1:49:40] old revelation in a new bottle and you
[1:49:42] can't put new revelation in an old
[1:49:44] bottle
[1:49:45] right they've got to grow together so
[1:49:47] listen you'll sit there and you'll say
[1:49:49] hey do i have faith for the rapture
[1:49:51] listen if you've only been serving the
[1:49:53] lord for 10 years you don't
[1:49:56] why
[1:49:57] new revelation new bottle you've got to
[1:49:59] age your revelation your faith has to
[1:50:01] grow as you do it when you get the holy
[1:50:04] ghost brother brahms you says you have
[1:50:05] the potential to create a world and go
[1:50:07] live on it he says but the law of god
[1:50:09] won't allow you to do it but he says you
[1:50:10] have that potential in you
[1:50:12] but as you grow in faith as god opens
[1:50:15] things up to you then your faith grows
[1:50:17] for what he shows you and until he shows
[1:50:18] you you can't have faith for it that's
[1:50:20] the way it's going to go amen so you
[1:50:22] don't get the holy spirit and
[1:50:23] immediately become ready for a rapture
[1:50:25] you are qualified for the rapture but
[1:50:27] you're not rapture ready in the sense if
[1:50:29] you don't have the faith for the rapture
[1:50:31] because what it's got to grow in you
[1:50:32] it's got to well up inside of you it's
[1:50:34] got to build up
[1:50:35] and then it's going to blow and that's
[1:50:37] when we go but god's got to bring that
[1:50:39] to you amen
[1:50:40] your revelation grows it causes your
[1:50:42] faith to grow and you can't force it you
[1:50:44] can't force revelation study does not
[1:50:46] give you revelation it didn't work for
[1:50:48] nicodemus and it didn't work for paul
[1:50:50] right until god opens your eyes then
[1:50:52] you're not going to go anywhere amen you
[1:50:54] can't make it up all you can do is the
[1:50:56] one thing we're told that brings faith
[1:50:57] amen spiritual understanding that's
[1:50:59] brought on by the hearing of the word
[1:51:02] brother braham says this he says and you
[1:51:04] are true and honest and just and upright
[1:51:06] and holy and respectable he says not
[1:51:09] because that isn't christianity you do
[1:51:10] that that's just the fruits of
[1:51:12] christianity because you believe it's
[1:51:14] the attributes of your faith in christ
[1:51:16] jesus and your birth as his son
[1:51:19] amen see a good tree can't bring forth
[1:51:22] corrupt fruit but a corrupt tree can
[1:51:24] bring forth corrupt fruit they just
[1:51:26] bring forth good fruit and by their
[1:51:27] fruits you shall know them he says now
[1:51:29] if the holy spirit comes into this
[1:51:31] building tonight and would declare his
[1:51:33] word to be the truth and you go out
[1:51:35] disbelieving you'd be a sinner if god
[1:51:38] tells you what your life has been and
[1:51:39] what it will be and if you know that
[1:51:41] what has been is the truth and tells you
[1:51:43] what will be if you go disbelieve it
[1:51:45] worse things than this will come upon
[1:51:46] you go ye and sin no more now sin
[1:51:49] doesn't mean go out and drink and carry
[1:51:51] on it says go ye and disbelieve no more
[1:51:54] amen
[1:51:55] there you are he says you know what i
[1:51:57] find the greatest trouble with the
[1:51:58] pentecostal church today is
[1:52:02] i'll extend this to the message
[1:52:05] positionally they don't know what they
[1:52:07] are amen your sons and daughters of god
[1:52:11] and a lot of times you're looking for
[1:52:13] something great to come but you already
[1:52:16] got that the greatest can be given to
[1:52:18] you
[1:52:19] now
[1:52:20] now he says we are the sons of god not
[1:52:23] we will be we are now and we're seated
[1:52:25] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:52:27] jesus right now oh my he says when faith
[1:52:30] like that gets in the church the devil
[1:52:32] moves away from the place
[1:52:34] satan hasn't got any legal rights at all
[1:52:36] over a christian
[1:52:37] every time a man gets saved god just
[1:52:39] writes out a whole big bunch of checks
[1:52:41] like that and puts his name at the
[1:52:42] bottom and said here they are fill them
[1:52:45] out are you scared of it he says fill it
[1:52:47] out whatever things you desire when you
[1:52:50] pray believe you receive it it'll be
[1:52:52] given to you mark 11 24. he says see
[1:52:55] just believe it we don't do checks
[1:52:57] anymore do we most of us
[1:52:59] we do e-transfers
[1:53:01] but even with e-transfers it's not
[1:53:02] always instantaneous if i send a hundred
[1:53:04] dollars it goes immediately if i send
[1:53:07] fifteen hundred dollars they take their
[1:53:08] time with that don't they to make sure
[1:53:09] it's authorized and everything's good to
[1:53:11] go and all of these different things i
[1:53:13] send i transfer between accounts
[1:53:15] sometimes and if i send a small amount
[1:53:17] it's in my email right away if i send a
[1:53:18] bigger amount sometimes it takes an hour
[1:53:20] for them to push it through because they
[1:53:21] have people checking everything right
[1:53:24] it's no different with god right
[1:53:27] you write the check
[1:53:28] that doesn't mean it goes through that
[1:53:29] day
[1:53:30] the funds are always there is what
[1:53:31] brother branham i'm saying the funds are
[1:53:33] always there
[1:53:34] sometimes it takes a while to make the
[1:53:36] transfer amen that's all it is
[1:53:39] amen when jesus died and said it was
[1:53:41] finished that's when every redemptive
[1:53:44] blessing was loosed
[1:53:46] so when it comes to healing
[1:53:49] deliverance
[1:53:50] the fruits of the spirit love joy peace
[1:53:52] patience all these different things when
[1:53:53] he
[1:53:54] died every single one of those was made
[1:53:56] available access to god
[1:53:58] you don't have to go through a ministry
[1:54:01] amen you don't have to go through a
[1:54:02] person you can go direct one-on-one and
[1:54:04] talk with god anytime you want right the
[1:54:06] veil was torn right every redemptive
[1:54:09] blessing was made available and brother
[1:54:11] brown says are you scared
[1:54:13] are you too scared to use them because
[1:54:15] he says they're all available when they
[1:54:16] were when he said it was finished that's
[1:54:18] when it was all available to us
[1:54:21] right god starts with faith for
[1:54:22] salvation
[1:54:24] right and even that is not your faith
[1:54:28] scripture says what that what by grace
[1:54:30] through faith are you saved and that not
[1:54:32] of yourself it is the gift of god amen
[1:54:34] so if it's the faith of god that starts
[1:54:36] it not your faith then why are we
[1:54:38] sitting here wondering if we're going to
[1:54:39] have faith for the next step
[1:54:41] it's the faith of god that started it
[1:54:43] it's the faith of god that keeps it
[1:54:44] moving and it's the faith of god that's
[1:54:46] going to finish it amen so why do we
[1:54:48] worry why do we stress am i going to
[1:54:50] make it am i going to be delivered am i
[1:54:53] going to be healed am i going to do this
[1:54:55] am i going to have that am i going to
[1:54:56] reflect this
[1:54:58] hey he started it
[1:55:00] it's his faith that started it
[1:55:02] brother mark when he was walking down
[1:55:03] the road that first time he didn't all
[1:55:05] of a sudden have faith to say hey i'll
[1:55:06] bet you if i talk to god right now he'll
[1:55:08] listen to me and make me his child
[1:55:11] did you
[1:55:12] no
[1:55:13] what happened
[1:55:15] god gave a call and gave him the faith
[1:55:17] to respond
[1:55:19] and that's grace that's grace because
[1:55:20] you had nothing to do with it brother
[1:55:22] mark there's nothing good or bad that he
[1:55:23] did to deserve it right it was just god
[1:55:26] dropped it in there and then god gave
[1:55:27] him the faith to respond to it amen
[1:55:29] so why do we worry about faith for the
[1:55:31] next step
[1:55:32] whatever it is
[1:55:33] whether it's relationships whether it's
[1:55:35] marriage whether it's career whether
[1:55:36] it's ministry
[1:55:38] whatever it might be why do we worry
[1:55:40] right if he started it he's going to
[1:55:42] finish it in each and every one of us
[1:55:43] amen for some of us it's faith to let
[1:55:45] him lead us
[1:55:46] take your hand off the steering wheel
[1:55:49] that's a great one for a believer you
[1:55:51] know they had that song jesus take the
[1:55:52] wheel
[1:55:54] we need to do a lot of letting jesus
[1:55:55] take the wheel amen for some of us it's
[1:55:58] our finances stop striving stop
[1:56:00] straining
[1:56:02] stop checking every nickel as it goes
[1:56:04] i'm a testimony to that
[1:56:06] i probably still need to do it you know
[1:56:09] what you check everything because you
[1:56:11] think well i gotta do my part and god's
[1:56:13] saying
[1:56:16] listen i got the cattle on a thousand
[1:56:18] hills and you're sitting there looking
[1:56:19] at nickels buddy what are you doing
[1:56:21] be careful don't lose your joy over it
[1:56:24] if you lost your joy you've gone too far
[1:56:26] is that the easy way to put it when you
[1:56:28] lose your joy god ain't in control
[1:56:30] right amen sometimes it's faith to be
[1:56:33] healed
[1:56:34] and guess what
[1:56:36] i look at great ministries great men
[1:56:38] and guess what they prayed for people
[1:56:40] look at brother branham himself
[1:56:42] prayed for people healed instantaneously
[1:56:44] supernatural miracles by the thousands
[1:56:47] maybe the millions and yet he has a
[1:56:49] problem with his stomach that doesn't go
[1:56:50] away until the last year of his life
[1:56:53] did brother branham lack faith
[1:56:54] anybody here want to accuse the prophet
[1:56:56] of god of lacking faith no
[1:56:58] god had to show him that now is the time
[1:57:01] and he said when god showed him remember
[1:57:03] when he was up in sabino canyon he saw
[1:57:05] that thing leap at him and he moved out
[1:57:06] of the way it impaled itself on the
[1:57:08] thorns and died that's when it went away
[1:57:10] for good
[1:57:11] right
[1:57:12] didn't have anything to do with his
[1:57:14] faith
[1:57:15] it was what there was more going on
[1:57:17] and that's the thing is so often we
[1:57:18] think it's about the event it's about
[1:57:20] the moment it's about the situation it's
[1:57:22] about the trial and it's not it's about
[1:57:24] the big big picture because it's not
[1:57:26] just about your healing it's not just
[1:57:28] about your deliverance see god's only
[1:57:30] got this much time and he's got to cram
[1:57:32] this much into it so it's not just your
[1:57:34] healing it's not just your deliverance
[1:57:36] it's not just your career it's not just
[1:57:37] your finances it's not just your
[1:57:39] marriage but it's all this character
[1:57:40] building that he's trying to go through
[1:57:42] remember patience is the one that has
[1:57:43] the perfect work
[1:57:45] faith keeps you going to have the
[1:57:47] patience
[1:57:48] that's all he's trying to do is let us
[1:57:49] sit back and say all right lord i'm
[1:57:51] believing i'm acting on that belief
[1:57:54] and that means it's up to you to let the
[1:57:56] check go through
[1:57:57] and when it goes through it's going
[1:57:59] through and i'll never have to wonder
[1:58:00] again
[1:58:01] and the bill will be paid from my side
[1:58:03] where i can see it he says we are here
[1:58:06] studying and we must have faith in what
[1:58:09] we're coming for because remember all
[1:58:11] redemptive blessings have been already
[1:58:14] purchased can we believe that with all
[1:58:16] of our heart that all the redemptive
[1:58:17] blessings was purchased
[1:58:19] god achieved that for us through calvary
[1:58:21] with jesus christ jesus said to the
[1:58:24] father it is finished what is finished
[1:58:26] the whole plan of salvation everything
[1:58:29] is finished all the promises that i made
[1:58:32] is how brother branham puts it all the
[1:58:34] promises that i made are finished the
[1:58:36] deposit is put before god that all sins
[1:58:38] are forgiven and we're back from the
[1:58:40] slave market and all has been redeemed
[1:58:42] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:58:45] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:58:46] chastisement of our peace is upon him
[1:58:48] and with his stripes we were healed it's
[1:58:51] all finished so what's he saying he's
[1:58:53] saying listen in the all these
[1:58:55] redemptive blessings are there
[1:58:58] and all you have to do is write the
[1:58:59] check
[1:59:00] how do you write the check revelation of
[1:59:02] god drops down you say father i'm
[1:59:05] believing your word you make your
[1:59:07] confession and then it's up to him to
[1:59:08] bring it to pass and you stay with that
[1:59:10] confession amen
[1:59:12] and in all that though he's going to
[1:59:14] bring you to maturity he's going to
[1:59:15] bring you to a place where you are born
[1:59:17] of his bone flesh of his flesh word of
[1:59:19] his word thought of his thought
[1:59:21] where he can trust you to act in his
[1:59:23] situation
[1:59:24] in his stead in a situation i should say
[1:59:26] amen he's bringing us to a oneness he's
[1:59:28] bringing us to a christ-like love he's
[1:59:30] developing a christ-like character in us
[1:59:32] and we think we lack faith and all we
[1:59:34] lack is sight to look beyond to see the
[1:59:36] big picture
[1:59:37] we're not lacking faith look at abraham
[1:59:38] 25 years
[1:59:40] abraham did he lack faith he kept
[1:59:42] walking he didn't go back home
[1:59:44] right he didn't marry another woman
[1:59:47] now he made some mistakes
[1:59:50] so i love i can identify with abraham
[1:59:52] and david and moses and all the rest
[1:59:56] even joseph right
[1:59:58] but what
[1:59:59] faith keeps you moving while god does
[2:00:02] the work in the rest of your life amen
[2:00:04] the the delay is not due to our faith
[2:00:06] but it's due for our need of growth and
[2:00:08] if god gave us everything we wanted when
[2:00:10] we wanted it we would be spoiled brats
[2:00:13] and you know what the devil says he says
[2:00:14] because you're a believer and you didn't
[2:00:16] get it immediately you're not a real
[2:00:17] believer you don't have the holy ghost
[2:00:18] and you don't have faith and nothing is
[2:00:20] further from the truth
[2:00:22] amen
[2:00:23] what is it god's using everything for
[2:00:25] our good even when we think we're
[2:00:27] failing
[2:00:28] the problem is we think we're failing
[2:00:31] and again has nothing to do with us
[2:00:34] so you're saying he's failing
[2:00:37] but you put it on yourself and you get
[2:00:38] mad at yourself but really what you're
[2:00:40] saying is god's failing because it's his
[2:00:42] work start to finish
[2:00:43] so stop blaming anybody and just sit
[2:00:45] back and let god do it and then move
[2:00:47] through the trial move through the
[2:00:48] situation he says now then we have a
[2:00:51] right then when we come to god and ask
[2:00:53] him for his help
[2:00:54] and that's what we're for here tonight
[2:00:56] here for tonight now if i'm telling you
[2:00:58] that work is already finished which the
[2:01:00] bible declares that it is finished then
[2:01:02] what could i do for it if it's already
[2:01:04] finished
[2:01:05] he said i can't add to this
[2:01:07] i can do something for you if it's
[2:01:09] already done
[2:01:10] the only thing i can do is point you to
[2:01:12] the time it was finished and the
[2:01:14] scripture that says it was finished and
[2:01:15] that's about all that can be done it
[2:01:17] rests within your personal faith in the
[2:01:20] finished work of jesus christ at calvary
[2:01:23] that's the only gospel i know that's
[2:01:25] written in the bible the work was
[2:01:26] finished at calvary and we only look to
[2:01:29] that place
[2:01:30] we only look to that place do we look
[2:01:33] elsewhere
[2:01:34] because if we're looking elsewhere then
[2:01:36] it's not going to work
[2:01:37] but by faith we draw dividends off of
[2:01:39] our eternal salvation i love how he puts
[2:01:41] that what are dividends when you buy
[2:01:43] into a certain stock or a certain
[2:01:45] company then every quarter as they make
[2:01:47] money or even if they don't make money
[2:01:49] these days they'll send whoever owns
[2:01:50] stock in that company
[2:01:52] a portion of money
[2:01:54] so that's a portion because you have
[2:01:55] ownership you automatically get money
[2:01:57] from them every single quarter that's
[2:01:59] all he says redemptive blessings are
[2:02:01] just god's dividends to you because why
[2:02:03] you have a part of him you are a part of
[2:02:04] him therefore you get the benefits of
[2:02:06] being a part of him amen he says what we
[2:02:09] only look to that place and by faith we
[2:02:11] draw dividends off of our eternal
[2:02:13] salvation this is the earnest of our
[2:02:15] salvation the scripture says
[2:02:18] he says now
[2:02:20] we look
[2:02:21] and live
[2:02:23] we believe
[2:02:24] that's all he's asking you to do look
[2:02:27] live
[2:02:28] believe
[2:02:29] now jesus when he died after making that
[2:02:31] promise he said the same things that he
[2:02:33] did the church would do until he
[2:02:35] returned again i'll be with you and in
[2:02:37] you to the end of the world and the
[2:02:38] things that i do you shall also greater
[2:02:41] than this or more than this will you do
[2:02:43] for i go to my father god was operating
[2:02:45] through one human being jesus and when
[2:02:48] he returned to god he operates
[2:02:50] universally in every believer's heart
[2:02:53] around the world listen i can start and
[2:02:56] i can start quoting names from sister
[2:02:58] sister betty to brother gerald to sister
[2:03:00] lily to sister rebecca and joe and come
[2:03:02] all the way down here and go all the way
[2:03:03] around and i can put your name right
[2:03:05] there it says he operates universally in
[2:03:08] every believer's heart around the world
[2:03:10] this is not some special call to to men
[2:03:13] or ministry or special gifts this is to
[2:03:16] everyone that he is called to believe
[2:03:17] this end time message he operates
[2:03:20] universally through every single one of
[2:03:22] us amen
[2:03:23] jesus said it is finished what was he
[2:03:25] pointing to you and i he's letting you
[2:03:27] and i know hey don't worry be not afraid
[2:03:31] how many times did the angel say be not
[2:03:33] afraid when he came with amazing things
[2:03:35] be not afraid don't be worried don't be
[2:03:37] anxious
[2:03:38] why it's a finished work right it still
[2:03:41] has to play through time but the veil
[2:03:42] was torn so that we could have access to
[2:03:44] god we could have access to the holy
[2:03:46] spirit brother braham says you just look
[2:03:47] to the finished work of calvary any time
[2:03:49] you get in into an issue anytime you get
[2:03:52] into trouble any time you see there's a
[2:03:53] lack you look to the finished work of
[2:03:55] calvary and say that's where i'm drawing
[2:03:56] my strength from i'm drawing strength
[2:03:58] because he said it's finished not
[2:04:00] because i feel finished and then if we
[2:04:02] go by the way we feel by the energy we
[2:04:04] have by the happiness we feel on a
[2:04:05] day-to-day basis we are going to be of
[2:04:07] all men most miserable and women
[2:04:09] right but if we look to that finished
[2:04:11] work then we can rest that he's going to
[2:04:13] make it all work through it men we don't
[2:04:14] look at symptoms
[2:04:16] we don't look at failures
[2:04:18] amen we don't look to our lack our
[2:04:20] slackness our mistakes we look to a
[2:04:21] finished work and believe that as he's
[2:04:23] looking at us through the blood of
[2:04:24] christ that means we're going to make it
[2:04:26] through no matter what and when christ
[2:04:28] comes he says we'll see him because we
[2:04:30] will be just like he is amen
[2:04:33] amen let's stand together if we would
[2:04:36] amen we're stuck in this body of time
[2:04:42] that's our curse
[2:04:44] is that we're stuck in a body of time
[2:04:45] but we're reading a word that's inspired
[2:04:47] from eternity so he sees the finished
[2:04:49] work he sees where we're going to end up
[2:04:51] he sees what you're going to go through
[2:04:53] and how it's going to change you and how
[2:04:54] it's going to grow you and how it's
[2:04:55] going to mature you in these things
[2:04:57] brethren says you're free because of it
[2:04:59] you're free because of it not because
[2:05:01] you have nothing here but you're free
[2:05:02] because he says it's a finished work and
[2:05:04] you can rest that no matter what you're
[2:05:05] going in amen but we just what holds us
[2:05:08] back we don't recognize what's going on
[2:05:10] right we're too busy looking at the
[2:05:12] situation we're so busy looking at the
[2:05:13] problems we're so busy looking at
[2:05:15] ourselves and god just needs to raise
[2:05:17] our sights a little bit higher to point
[2:05:18] us to the joy
[2:05:19] that comes when you realize that there's
[2:05:21] a bigger thing going on there's a bitter
[2:05:23] pig picture being painted and then we
[2:05:25] look and you know if this was my life
[2:05:27] right here and and all i was concerned
[2:05:29] about is i was surrounded by dirt
[2:05:31] it wouldn't be much of a picture but if
[2:05:33] you look in here and i'm surrounded by a
[2:05:35] tabernacle and the sacrifices and all
[2:05:37] these other people i'd say hey life
[2:05:39] isn't really so bad but if all i'm
[2:05:40] looking at is where i'm standing with my
[2:05:42] dirt it's a tough life i'm living isn't
[2:05:44] it he says lift up your eyes a little
[2:05:45] bit higher amen
[2:05:47] what's the trial to believe
[2:05:49] when you see no evidence
[2:05:50] when nothing's moving
[2:05:52] you feel like nothing's changing the
[2:05:54] thing is this when you're walking on the
[2:05:56] slightest of inclines you walk on it
[2:05:58] long enough you get to a much higher
[2:05:59] level but you don't really notice that
[2:06:01] incline and that's often the way it is
[2:06:02] with the believer sometimes you're
[2:06:04] walking for a long time seems like
[2:06:05] nothing happens and then you look around
[2:06:06] and you say whoa
[2:06:09] what happened
[2:06:10] i tell the story of my mom remember with
[2:06:12] the makeup and she came to the message
[2:06:14] and she still loved having makeup and
[2:06:15] she said to god she said
[2:06:17] lord
[2:06:18] i like my makeup your prophet said we
[2:06:20] shouldn't wear it so i'm going to ask
[2:06:21] you to take it away she didn't try and
[2:06:23] stop wearing makeup
[2:06:25] she just left it in his hand she said
[2:06:26] six months later i realized i wasn't
[2:06:28] wearing makeup anymore why slow gradual
[2:06:31] slope
[2:06:32] right sometimes god steps in
[2:06:34] supernaturally and you heal people you
[2:06:36] know they they get saved and they give
[2:06:37] their life to god they get baptized and
[2:06:39] they're they're on drugs they're smoking
[2:06:41] alcohol and they just go boom and they
[2:06:43] just jump 10 stories in a leap because
[2:06:45] that's god cleaning them up that's a
[2:06:46] sanctifying work but when we're looking
[2:06:48] at growth growth never happens like that
[2:06:51] even the fastest growing things like
[2:06:53] bamboo in the world they can grow six
[2:06:54] inches over you know in 24 hours but
[2:06:57] it's still not immediate there's still
[2:06:58] got to be something happening amen
[2:07:00] that's what we've got to do is trust
[2:07:01] that it's a finished work even when we
[2:07:03] don't see anything happening amen amen
[2:07:06] let's bow our heads if we would
[2:07:10] heavenly father lord what peace it is
[2:07:12] to know that it's finished
[2:07:14] lord and though we're stuck in time lord
[2:07:16] though we're stuck in these
[2:07:18] twice cursed bodies heavenly father
[2:07:20] lord though we often seem like we're
[2:07:22] lacking so much
[2:07:24] lord yet we know the promise says that
[2:07:26] we will be complete and lacking nothing
[2:07:27] when this is all said and done
[2:07:29] and lord we just ask that you would help
[2:07:31] us to surrender ourselves anew
[2:07:34] lord as we dwell on the great sacrifice
[2:07:36] that you made lord may we know that it
[2:07:37] was not for nothing lord that you didn't
[2:07:40] just do it on the off chance that
[2:07:41] somebody might take its benefits but
[2:07:43] lord that you did it for a pre
[2:07:45] predestined a for ordained group of
[2:07:47] people lord that are going to live the
[2:07:49] very life of christ lord on this earth
[2:07:51] lord we pray that you would lift our
[2:07:53] eyes up a little bit higher lord may we
[2:07:55] not look at each other lord the faults
[2:07:57] and failures lord the prophet said if
[2:07:59] you go looking for them you'll find them
[2:08:01] every time but lord if we can look to
[2:08:03] the word that is within each other lord
[2:08:05] we know that we can join together and
[2:08:06] we'll make it through lord that will be
[2:08:08] built together into an inhabitation for
[2:08:10] you

[2:08:14] orders of the service lord may you just
[2:08:16] minister to hearts and souls lord we
[2:08:18] pray there will be healing in the cup
[2:08:20] that there will be deliverance in the
[2:08:21] cup or that there would be lord the love
[2:08:23] that we spoke of in the cup lord that
[2:08:25] you would just put a supernatural touch
[2:08:27] in our hearts and souls lord that your

[2:24:13] amen first corinthians 11.
[2:24:22] in a very familiar scripture
[2:24:25] we'll start in verse 23 and we'll read
[2:24:27] responsibly i'll start with the first
[2:24:29] verse and the church the second and
[2:24:31] we'll alternate and we'll all join in on
[2:24:33] the last one
[2:24:35] amen first corinthians 11 23 says for i
[2:24:38] have received of the lord that which
[2:24:40] also i delivered unto you
[2:24:42] that the lord jesus the same night in
[2:24:44] which he was betrayed took bread
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:57] and after the same manner also he took
[2:24:59] the cup when he had supped saying this
[2:25:01] cup is the new testament in my blood
[2:25:04] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:25:07] remembrance of me
[2:25:16] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:25:18] and drink this cup of the lord
[2:25:20] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:25:23] and blood of the lord
[2:25:31] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:25:33] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[2:25:36] to himself not discerning the lord's
[2:25:38] body
[2:25:44] for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:25:46] should not be judged
[2:25:55] wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:25:56] together to eat
[2:25:58] tarry one for another
