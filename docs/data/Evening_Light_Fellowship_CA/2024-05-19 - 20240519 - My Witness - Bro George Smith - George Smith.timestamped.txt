[44:32] seated it's good to be
[44:35] here and uh I'm here for three reasons
[44:38] one is Brother John
[44:42] invited and I'm very thankful and very
[44:47] thankful for a young man with Clear
[44:50] Vision that is now taken over may God
[44:54] bless brother Gerald we had a had a nice
[44:57] time last
[44:58] night okay that's reason number one
[45:01] reason number two I felt led of the Holy
[45:03] Ghost see when somebody invites well
[45:06] that's already like
[45:07] 51% but then we got to have the rest you
[45:10] know and so I felt led to be
[45:13] here and reason number three um as you
[45:17] know God deals in dreams now all my
[45:20] dreams disappear minute I open my eyes
[45:22] you know like some of you but some
[45:25] people dream uh spiritual dreams and so
[45:29] um I've got a good friend out west that
[45:33] uh God uses in
[45:36] dreams and so latest dream he had um he
[45:40] was he's telling me about it and he only
[45:43] speaks Spanish okay and so keep that in
[45:47] mind and so anyway he is um he's like a
[45:50] fly on the wall in brother brandom's
[45:52] living room in
[45:53] Jeffersonville that's the dream and so
[45:57] what he sees
[45:58] there Rebecca and I are sitting by the
[46:01] fireplace and over here in the the two
[46:03] chairs the sister brandham and brother
[46:05] Neville they're talking discussing
[46:07] things and um pretty soon brother
[46:10] Neville gets up to leave you know goes
[46:12] towards the door and sister brandom goes
[46:15] with him to the door say
[46:17] goodbye and then uh remember brother the
[46:20] Neville died in 74 sister Bram died in
[46:24] 81 and then they said Rebecca come come
[46:27] over here so she goes over there she she
[46:30] left in 2006 we'll cover that later and
[46:33] uh they're over there at the door I'm
[46:35] still by the fireplace and they said to
[46:37] me you keep doing what you're doing so
[46:41] that's why I'm here today keep doing
[46:42] what I'm doing so I'm not an Entertainer
[46:46] I'm only a faithful witness and we're
[46:48] trying to stay balanced I know that's a
[46:52] odd word to some people but uh okay you
[46:55] guys did a good job
[46:57] yeah it's balanced got to check if a
[47:00] Pulpit is out of balance we got to start
[47:01] somewhere else you know okay but that's
[47:04] there to keep your eyes on
[47:06] something that doesn't fail you must
[47:10] have balance now I noticed last night
[47:13] when we were enjoying the food over
[47:15] there some people were a little bit out
[47:17] of
[47:18] balance you
[47:20] know like three cups of coffee is too
[47:23] much you know but um we're here to have
[47:26] a good time in the Lord and um uh in our
[47:30] scripture it doesn't say anything about
[47:32] an attorney Jesus Christ is the
[47:35] righteous one he's our attorney it
[47:37] doesn't say anything about a judge
[47:38] because nobody qualifies it doesn't have
[47:41] many no matter how many years you've
[47:42] been traveling this road and who your
[47:46] ancestors are nobody's a
[47:50] judge um a lot of times and I know
[47:53] there's people right here that have the
[47:54] little thing in their ear they go
[47:56] through the airport and they're just
[47:57] blabbing away who are you talking to you
[48:00] know I'm only hearing half the
[48:02] conversation so if I get close I can
[48:04] hear half then I can pass judgment on
[48:07] what I hear we do that all the time we
[48:10] hear the neighbors arguing we can make a
[48:12] judgment on whatever we think we heard
[48:15] but um nobody qualifies for a judge only
[48:18] to be a
[48:19] witness so we trust that someone can
[48:21] learn today from our
[48:24] testimony uh I'm the only one that can
[48:26] tell this story you all have a testimony
[48:29] also we heard some of it last night and
[48:31] when we get on the other side and
[48:33] there's no clocks there's no Sunrise
[48:35] Sunset then I can sit down and listen to
[48:37] everyone your
[48:40] story and um so I'm the eagle that was
[48:43] born in the Baptist chicken yard and I
[48:46] learned right away that okay God's grace
[48:50] brought me to a fuller Revelation the
[48:52] word says all this also we don't have
[48:54] any right to throw rocks at the chicken
[48:56] yard
[48:57] there's there's other eagles over there
[48:59] maybe now those chickens are looking at
[49:01] us they look at you your family they're
[49:03] all out here they're watching to see how
[49:06] your Revelation how your religion
[49:09] carries you through the current crisis
[49:11] you know so all we got to do is live the
[49:13] truth we don't have to worry about all
[49:14] those other people and so um we must
[49:18] find balance in our Christian walk now
[49:22] in our world today there are about 7,000
[49:27] known
[49:28] languages now some people it's 100
[49:30] people some it's a thousand and they're
[49:32] Millions but 7,000 distinct languages
[49:36] okay the Bible is only in 700
[49:40] languages the New Testament is in 1500
[49:43] languages so people are busy still
[49:46] getting the translation into those
[49:49] languages and uh on October 6th 1536 a
[49:53] long time ago there was a man by the
[49:55] name of William tind
[49:57] in England and his aim was to translate
[50:00] the Bible into English we didn't always
[50:02] have this English translation okay
[50:05] people died that you might have this
[50:08] okay and so there's still people that
[50:10] don't have Bibles we're busy buying
[50:12] Bibles to put into people's hands in
[50:14] South America right now and so when my
[50:17] parents graduated from uh Bible School
[50:21] in
[50:22] 1944 uh their idea was as young
[50:27] Christians having been trained you know
[50:29] in Bible uh knowledge and so forth they
[50:33] wanted to go and find a tribe in the
[50:36] mountains of Mexico south of El
[50:39] Paso that had no written language only
[50:42] oral but see it's hard for us to believe
[50:44] in 2024 that there's people out there
[50:47] that don't have a written language we
[50:49] can all read and write there's people
[50:51] right here in this town probably that
[50:52] can't read but there's people out there
[50:54] that don't have a written language so
[50:57] they
[50:58] um uh bought a I think they bought a
[51:01] used Navy truck or something it's a
[51:03] four-wheel drive thing and and here they
[51:05] go two young people stuff they thought
[51:08] they needed and they're going to go find
[51:09] these people
[51:11] well um they uh went as far as the truck
[51:15] would go and then they had to park it
[51:18] because there's no more road so we got
[51:19] to get our stuff together and rent some
[51:22] horses and go four days camping out
[51:25] every night sounds like a lot of fun
[51:27] right now camping out to me is holiday
[51:30] and express not out there in the
[51:33] Rocks but anyway they're on the way up
[51:35] there and they find these people and so
[51:39] the first thing is to make contact with
[51:42] people that don't speak Spanish of
[51:43] course they didn't know a lot of Spanish
[51:44] either but um this unknown Unwritten
[51:48] language and you have to talk with them
[51:51] and get their trust and start learning
[51:55] words that they're saying you know wood
[51:58] or whatever they say wood is you got to
[52:01] make a dictionary it's a long process
[52:04] well after a while excuse me being up
[52:08] there uh as happens in you know the
[52:11] young Christians or young married life
[52:13] they're going to have a baby born so
[52:15] they come out the four days on the horse
[52:17] and instead of getting back in the truck
[52:19] and going back to Grandma's house in
[52:21] Arizona they got on the train and went
[52:23] to Mexico City and that's where their
[52:26] first first child was born in late
[52:28] August
[52:30] 1945 that was
[52:33] me so that's why I can claim Mexican
[52:37] citizenship because I was born there of
[52:40] American
[52:41] parents well eventually uh over the next
[52:45] 20 years it became obvious that I was
[52:47] the first of 10 children five boys and
[52:50] five girls okay and um so this whole
[52:54] idea of of getting the language into
[52:56] written
[52:57] form and then after you have a
[52:59] dictionary then you can proceed to
[53:01] Gospel of John that can take 20
[53:05] years we see we we can't understand that
[53:08] we live in immediate times and so my dad
[53:11] wasn't that kind of a patient man I'm an
[53:13] eyewitness to that and so he decided to
[53:16] leave that blessing to someone else and
[53:19] eventually it did get
[53:20] done um but see these
[53:23] people to teach them to read their own
[53:26] language that that's a whole another
[53:28] project so what they did I found out
[53:31] later they they made the dictionary
[53:34] translated John and maybe Romans or
[53:36] whatever and they put it on audio they
[53:38] put on little records and the people
[53:40] they can hear that oh yeah that's our
[53:42] language so it all worked out well
[53:45] anyway so my dad left that to someone
[53:47] else and he moved over to the East Coast
[53:50] of Mexico over near the gulf and that's
[53:53] where he established a um a Bible school
[53:57] for ministers and Sunday school workers
[53:59] and so forth and it's still there today
[54:01] and so we were there when it began
[54:03] that's when I I think I entered the
[54:05] second grade over there so I had all of
[54:08] the uh I had I think I had the first
[54:10] grade in in America but all the other
[54:12] six grades were in Spanish everything is
[54:14] in Spanish all the multiplication tables
[54:17] all the numbers in my head are all in
[54:19] Spanish right bla yeah see that's my
[54:23] buddy she understands the
[54:25] language and and so um so here I was the
[54:28] only white kid in this school we lived
[54:30] about I don't know 2 or 300 miles south
[54:33] of Laredo
[54:34] Texas and I'd made some friends in
[54:37] school and so
[54:39] um we didn't they didn't have pencil
[54:42] sharpers we didn't I don't know if they
[54:44] had invented them or we didn't have one
[54:45] down there every kid had a single-edged
[54:48] razor blade yeah hidden in his book he
[54:51] take it out and sharpen his pencil and
[54:53] put it back well today they put you in
[54:54] jail for that you know times have
[54:57] changed and so one day this kid gets a a
[55:00] real sharp point on his pencil and when
[55:03] I was looking off somewhere else he
[55:04] jabbed me in the arm and when he saw
[55:06] that I had red blood like him then we
[55:08] could be friends so I don't know what
[55:10] his parents have been telling him but um
[55:12] I made some friends well anyway so I'm
[55:15] growing up on the East Coast of Mexico
[55:17] and being the missionary Son Well we on
[55:20] the front row every service no back then
[55:23] I don't know about up here but back then
[55:25] the kids didn't didn't have any answers
[55:27] they didn't ask us questions what would
[55:29] you like dear no here's your pancake
[55:31] here's your orange juice when you finish
[55:33] it you can get away from the table well
[55:34] it's different today and so nobody asked
[55:37] us would you like to go to church today
[55:39] get your car we're leaving and so here
[55:43] we are in the in the in the front row
[55:46] well finally by the time I'm about 9
[55:47] years old I realized Jesus died for me
[55:51] too not just for the Mexican people but
[55:53] for me and so because the scriptures
[55:56] says all have
[55:57] sinned all the L kids all the everybody
[56:03] the
[56:04] Snows all the
[56:07] cofas all the brandom all the
[56:09] Smiths all have sinned and come short of
[56:12] the glory of God we can't make it
[56:15] without Jesus Christ you can't make it
[56:17] without the cross you know and so
[56:20] whoever shall call upon the name of the
[56:21] Lord shall be saved and I remember
[56:24] receiving the Lord Jesus as my savior
[56:26] and I was baptized in the Baptist Church
[56:29] on Easter Sunday of
[56:30] 1955 a long time
[56:33] ago now we had the same Bible okay we we
[56:37] only knew part of it we didn't know the
[56:39] whole book and so U by the time we get
[56:42] to 1958 and stay awake we're going to
[56:44] get to the good part here in a little
[56:45] bit
[56:47] but by the time we get to 1958 I've been
[56:50] through all six grades of school in
[56:54] Spanish and of course in home my mother
[56:56] was teaching us you know certain English
[56:58] things we needed but she had some rules
[57:01] well you can imagine of course by then
[57:02] she only had about I think maybe five
[57:04] kids but anyway uh she was a very strict
[57:08] disciplinarian and uh she said now at
[57:11] home in the house we speak English you
[57:13] can speak Spanish outside the only
[57:15] person you speak Spanish to here is the
[57:18] hired help that we have and such was the
[57:21] rule that um if American missionary
[57:24] showed up you know and spoke perfect
[57:26] Spanish we didn't speak Spanish to him
[57:28] oh you're Greeno we speak English to you
[57:31] and even today I can get around people
[57:33] and they they know me because of the
[57:36] message and and they won't speak English
[57:38] to me they only speak Spanish so anyway
[57:42] so I celebrated my 13th birthday in
[57:45] Houston Texas I've been sent to America
[57:48] to finish the next sixth grades of
[57:51] course I didn't have a vote in it well
[57:53] they decided way you go
[57:56] and so all these new experiences in an
[57:58] American school you know nobody speaking
[58:00] Spanish and so I thought well you know
[58:02] if I take Spanish as an elective in my
[58:05] seventh grade that should be whiz well
[58:08] it wasn't quite that easy because I grew
[58:10] up with Spanish and so this is just the
[58:13] way you talk I didn't know the rules why
[58:16] this and why it's ridiculous and just
[58:18] like with the English spelling well you
[58:21] know we have the certain way we
[58:22] pronounce it and got short a and long a
[58:24] all this nonsense in the rules and the
[58:27] exceptions to the rules well what a
[58:29] waste of time just memorize the words
[58:31] it'll always be the same I mean business
[58:34] is not spelled like business or Arkansas
[58:37] or a lot of other things you know so
[58:39] anyway um here I am in the in American
[58:42] school and eventually my family moved up
[58:46] uh I did
[58:47] spend I think I spent the ninth grade
[58:50] with the menite people in
[58:52] Chihuahua and um So eventually I ended
[58:55] up in in Tucson Arizona where my mother
[58:58] was born raised living my living with my
[59:01] grandfather
[59:02] 1962 going to high school you know 10th
[59:06] grade and uh so then my parents moved to
[59:09] Tucson and you know got the home kind of
[59:12] established but you know um in this
[59:16] school now I don't know how big the
[59:17] schools are here but in Tucson at that
[59:20] time this high school was 2 200 kids
[59:22] it's a lot of people and so I was the
[59:25] one that had the reputation I'm the new
[59:28] kid that didn't go to the dances didn't
[59:29] smoke didn't drink and you know my
[59:32] friends were were um uh the U people
[59:37] from Salt Lake City you know that they
[59:39] have they no Bible but then when it gets
[59:41] tight they go to their other book you
[59:42] know the Mormons and so um here we are
[59:47] living in Tucson going to this big
[59:49] school and so one day uh this girl comes
[59:54] up to me and she says now now we know
[59:56] you're so picky but we know we I don't
[59:59] know how many we was but we know exactly
[1:00:02] the girl for you well I wasn't
[1:00:04] necessarily looking for a girl uh I was
[1:00:07] happy in the Baptist Church I was
[1:00:09] helping to lead the singing you know and
[1:00:11] and here I was a uh junior in high
[1:00:15] school and so I said well where is she
[1:00:18] well she's way over there getting on the
[1:00:20] bus and so the next day they introduced
[1:00:23] me to Rebecca
[1:00:24] Brandon well sure enough most beautiful
[1:00:27] girl I'd ever seen and she had that
[1:00:29] southern Indiana accent that kind of set
[1:00:31] her apart so people like to hear her
[1:00:33] talk you know because nobody in Tucson
[1:00:35] talk like that and um and so here we
[1:00:39] both meet and we're both
[1:00:42] 17 you know Rebecca meet George and so
[1:00:47] she said now you have to meet my dad my
[1:00:49] dad's preacher well they didn't scare me
[1:00:52] because we'd had a lot of preachers come
[1:00:53] through our house
[1:00:56] and then the interesting thing is God
[1:00:57] moved these people from Indiana um you
[1:01:00] know over 2,000 kilometers to Tucson and
[1:01:04] just a block from my house wow how
[1:01:06] convenient that was and so I go to meet
[1:01:09] her dad and I'd never n I'd never heard
[1:01:12] this name before okay we're in the
[1:01:13] Baptist Church we don't care about the
[1:01:15] Pentecostals and all those people we we
[1:01:17] knew what was what we
[1:01:19] knew and so I go to meet her
[1:01:23] dad and here's a man in the backyard
[1:01:25] with no shirt on you know cutting the
[1:01:27] plants or something and and she
[1:01:29] introduces me and then she disappears
[1:01:31] here I'm with her dad and remember I'm
[1:01:34] not scared I never heard of him before
[1:01:36] all I knew this got this is the next
[1:01:38] step you got to take to get closer to
[1:01:40] the girl and so we talked a little while
[1:01:44] and but see I was there for a purpose I
[1:01:46] had a a mission I wanted to know her
[1:01:48] better but I had to come through him and
[1:01:51] so we talked for a little while and he
[1:01:53] gave me
[1:01:54] permission yeah
[1:01:56] that's simple well see what I found out
[1:01:59] later he was scanning the hard
[1:02:03] drive you
[1:02:05] know all the way maybe till today and so
[1:02:10] um being a prophet he could do
[1:02:12] that I had permission he had the problem
[1:02:15] because there were some other guys that
[1:02:17] was kind of waiting there a little
[1:02:18] opportunity and they knew who he was and
[1:02:20] they were scared to death well they lost
[1:02:24] out and so
[1:02:26] um at the time I was driving a a
[1:02:29] four-year-old Ford pickup let see back
[1:02:32] then we didn't have dual cab we didn't
[1:02:33] have air condition have nothing you know
[1:02:35] had three speeds and um and so but it
[1:02:38] was clean you know it wasn't ugly and
[1:02:41] but her brother she had a big brother
[1:02:43] that had a brand new red
[1:02:45] Chevrolet and I thought M this might be
[1:02:47] a problem older brother but he was a
[1:02:49] skinny kid like me so didn't matter and
[1:02:52] uh but her dad drove a Ford so we got
[1:02:54] along just fine well when they moved
[1:02:57] from Indiana to
[1:03:00] Arizona uh it was by Vision you've all
[1:03:03] heard you know the story and so um they
[1:03:06] didn't know how long they were going to
[1:03:07] be they moved because they were going to
[1:03:10] tear up the driveway and he shouldn't be
[1:03:11] there well
[1:03:13] anyway at that point Rebecca had been in
[1:03:17] classical piano training piano teacher
[1:03:19] down the road little days uh I think
[1:03:21] almost 10 years when all of a sudden you
[1:03:23] take a a girl out of you know mid uh
[1:03:27] junior year 11th grade cross country
[1:03:30] there's no piano there's no friends
[1:03:33] there's no church no trees no nothing
[1:03:35] well she can be a little of it you know
[1:03:37] scatterbrain and um
[1:03:40] so and they don't know how long they're
[1:03:42] going to be there they live in a duplex
[1:03:44] apartment and um so one day brother
[1:03:47] Randon is getting his kids together to
[1:03:49] go to supper before I ever met him and
[1:03:52] um he looks in the back of the station
[1:03:55] wagon there's only two kids where's
[1:03:56] where's Rebecca oh she's at the corner
[1:03:58] you know Sister ma said and we'll pick
[1:04:00] up her on the way so he goes to the
[1:04:02] corner stops and goes in well as he
[1:04:04] approaches the house he hears the piano
[1:04:07] yeah there's two girls there's 20
[1:04:08] fingers on one piano and they're playing
[1:04:11] and it's not down at the cross or Jesus
[1:04:13] loves me or anything like that it's uh
[1:04:15] it's not it's not Beethoven or braam or
[1:04:18] anything it's just rock and roll you
[1:04:20] know 17-year-old kids and so boy his
[1:04:24] heart stretched to break he bangs on the
[1:04:26] door and so she comes to the door now he
[1:04:29] was a balanced man he wasn't didn't jerk
[1:04:31] his Bell off what are you doing no all
[1:04:34] he said it's time to go so we go and she
[1:04:38] said I never heard another word about
[1:04:39] that for two months you know well when
[1:04:43] he tells the story about that
[1:04:45] experience it's uh in one of the
[1:04:48] questions answers of uh August of
[1:04:51] 64 it sounds like she's really headed to
[1:04:54] the world you know this is just playing
[1:04:56] the piano at the neighbor's house but he
[1:04:58] said and then she met George and he's a
[1:05:00] Christian in the problem how's that
[1:05:03] because I was taken to the Baptist
[1:05:05] church every Sunday and he was very
[1:05:06] happy he even went with us a few
[1:05:09] times and uh so you're wondering well
[1:05:11] why didn't you just drop it all God has
[1:05:14] a way of doing things why are you here
[1:05:17] today why didn't you move to California
[1:05:19] wherever Europe you're here God has a
[1:05:22] way of doing things and so um so I got
[1:05:26] to know him a little better of course
[1:05:27] this was in early 63 maybe I don't know
[1:05:29] if it was February or March somewhere in
[1:05:31] there but then when he's preaching in in
[1:05:33] Tucson in early June first meeting I
[1:05:36] went to uh now I'm seeing the man of God
[1:05:39] you know in the pulpit and the gift and
[1:05:41] all the wow this is right there in the
[1:05:43] Bible and um so I'm I'm going home that
[1:05:47] night and I said now Lord this is this
[1:05:49] is serious it's either something that
[1:05:51] came straight from you or it's the
[1:05:53] biggest hoax that ever hit the earth you
[1:05:55] know there's nowhere to put a a pen in
[1:05:57] it it's real and so God began to reveal
[1:06:00] me you know reveal to me this is the the
[1:06:02] truth now brother R traveled a lot but
[1:06:05] when he was home you know in Tucson I
[1:06:08] could visit we could spend time together
[1:06:09] we could discuss scripture whatever and
[1:06:11] he was a real friend uh he he enjoyed
[1:06:15] talking about the scripture and I was
[1:06:18] always welcome you know and so people
[1:06:20] ask me well what attracted you to this
[1:06:22] ministry well the bait on the hook was
[1:06:24] the girl that was obvious but um but
[1:06:28] then with William brandom that was
[1:06:30] different that was that was you know two
[1:06:32] different tracks and um and what always
[1:06:36] impressed me right from the first met
[1:06:38] time I met him uh I knew a lot of people
[1:06:41] that had studied the Bible they had read
[1:06:44] the Bible and but here's a man that's
[1:06:47] actually living the spirit of the
[1:06:48] scripture it's like he tells the story
[1:06:51] about U um about uh Daniel Boone or
[1:06:57] about Tarzan or something where you read
[1:06:59] that stuff they want to live in the tree
[1:07:00] you want to be like that well he was he
[1:07:02] was exhibiting the spirit of the
[1:07:04] scripture you know just that simple and
[1:07:07] so I'd already read my Bible through I
[1:07:10] think twice by that
[1:07:12] time but I hadn't seen anybody that
[1:07:14] could actually live it like he was
[1:07:15] living it and that's what attracted me
[1:07:17] and that that was what what led me to it
[1:07:20] I wasn't in the in the Pew watching The
[1:07:22] Miracles no I was I was watching the
[1:07:24] life of a man that was preaching the
[1:07:26] word and so we were taught to read the
[1:07:29] Bible and memorize and so forth but he
[1:07:31] was actually living it so that's what
[1:07:33] attracted my attention and of course the
[1:07:35] supernatural that was just better yet
[1:07:38] but um even you know my mother had
[1:07:41] taught us you read your Bible and you
[1:07:43] pray every day well here's William
[1:07:45] brandom you want to get closer to God
[1:07:48] you read your Bible and pray it's it's
[1:07:50] best formula so anyway as uh just maybe
[1:07:54] a little glimpse into what I call the
[1:07:56] prophetic Dimension um the life that he
[1:07:59] lived how you you hear it on tape but
[1:08:01] what's behind that what how did how did
[1:08:03] we get to that point well you know
[1:08:05] prophets speak from eternity everything
[1:08:08] is present tense brother Brandon could
[1:08:10] say now the other day what if we say the
[1:08:13] other day that might have been Wednesday
[1:08:15] or Tuesday but to him it could be 5
[1:08:17] years ago you know um and then when he
[1:08:21] when he is addressing the crowd well
[1:08:24] he's not just seeing 50 people he might
[1:08:26] see 400 you know um because he's living
[1:08:29] in in two
[1:08:30] dimensions and the other dimension is
[1:08:32] faster than this one and we have the
[1:08:34] scripture where Elisha and his helper
[1:08:36] were in the house and and they were
[1:08:37] under siege you know and and so Elisha
[1:08:40] says the young man go out and see what's
[1:08:42] going on so he goes out there and all he
[1:08:43] can see is soldiers and swords and
[1:08:45] horses oh he comes back shaking and
[1:08:48] tells Elisha what he saw now Elisha
[1:08:50] didn't smack him and you know get upset
[1:08:54] he just put his hand on the Lord open
[1:08:56] the young man's eyes now go check again
[1:08:58] well there's all these angels on the
[1:09:00] hillsides wow a whole lot more than
[1:09:02] there were soldiers well that's the
[1:09:04] prophetic Dimension okay so brother
[1:09:06] brandham is um scheduled for these
[1:09:08] meetings in Houston Texas in January of
[1:09:12] 1950 and um it was a different Houston
[1:09:15] than it is today there's still some
[1:09:17] godly people there and so while he's in
[1:09:21] this 10-day campaign there was a Baptist
[1:09:24] minister
[1:09:25] that thought it was his job to prove
[1:09:27] that this is all wrong just a bunch of
[1:09:30] psychology you know and so it even got
[1:09:33] into the newspapers and so then um
[1:09:36] brother Bosworth was helping brother
[1:09:37] brandom at the time in the meetings and
[1:09:39] he said now brother brandom this is
[1:09:40] getting pretty serious out here we got
[1:09:42] to do something we got to answer these
[1:09:44] questions brother B said no we're not
[1:09:46] going to waste one night on one man when
[1:09:48] there's hundreds need to be prayed for
[1:09:51] So eventually brother Bosworth convinced
[1:09:53] him that he could do it calmly but it's
[1:09:55] going to get hurt and um so word got out
[1:09:58] that there's going to be a debate well
[1:10:00] now instead of a Auditorium for 6,000 he
[1:10:03] says they went into the auditorium of
[1:10:05] 30,000 but if you check the internet
[1:10:09] that new building only held 9,000 people
[1:10:11] so he's seeing a whole lot more than
[1:10:13] what we think you know and so they're in
[1:10:16] this new building and and so brother Ram
[1:10:18] said well I'm not going to church
[1:10:19] tonight you guys handle it I'll come
[1:10:21] tomorrow night and so they scheduled up
[1:10:24] for a certain
[1:10:26] night and so um but the holy spirit said
[1:10:28] no you need to go to church you need to
[1:10:30] be there so it's him and his wife and
[1:10:35] four-year-old Rebecca little bitty thing
[1:10:39] and um and then brother R's brother so
[1:10:42] the four of them and so they go and they
[1:10:44] way up in the balcony where you can see
[1:10:46] down here and so he um he's up there and
[1:10:49] he's watching the go on down there and
[1:10:51] so brother Bosworth says to the Baptist
[1:10:53] Minister well to begin with
[1:10:55] one
[1:10:57] question we have seven compound names of
[1:11:00] Jehovah you know Redemption can we bring
[1:11:02] those from the Old Testament to the New
[1:11:04] Testament yes or no can we apply those
[1:11:06] to Jesus Christ well the Baptist
[1:11:08] Minister had to think a minut it because
[1:11:10] now he's getting fixed to get hung
[1:11:12] because if he says no then there's no
[1:11:14] salvation and if he says yes then it
[1:11:17] includes Divine Healing and that was the
[1:11:19] big deal still to this day that Divine
[1:11:21] Healing is not in the atonement well
[1:11:25] so they had a bit of a debate and you
[1:11:28] can hear most of this on tape but um um
[1:11:32] when it's over it kind of come to an end
[1:11:35] brother Bosworth says now I believe
[1:11:36] brother brandom's in the audience well
[1:11:39] yeah I mean it's it's difficult to pick
[1:11:41] somebody out right here with 50 people
[1:11:43] but if you have N9 or 10 or
[1:11:45] 30,000 let's see where is he you know
[1:11:48] and brother brand said he came in in
[1:11:51] Disguise not don't what he did to
[1:11:52] disguise himself but he came in nobody
[1:11:54] knew he was there there okay so he's way
[1:11:57] up there in the balcony he's right on
[1:11:58] the edge and for the first time
[1:12:01] four-year-old Rebecca is sitting on his
[1:12:03] lap wow because all the other services
[1:12:06] that she's in he's up here and she sees
[1:12:08] all the other little girls sitting on
[1:12:09] their Daddy's lap so this is a very
[1:12:11] proud moment for her she remembered it
[1:12:12] very well four years old and so he um he
[1:12:17] starts to get up you know to come down
[1:12:20] and his brother sitting there and said
[1:12:22] don't you dare get up well I have a riot
[1:12:24] here and and his wife intervene she
[1:12:26] don't worry he knows what he's doing so
[1:12:28] he puts Rebecca in his seat and he comes
[1:12:30] walking down and he said there were so
[1:12:32] many sick people there there was there
[1:12:34] was cases that would make the heart of
[1:12:36] an Iron Man
[1:12:37] melt pretty stiff you know and so he
[1:12:41] comes down comes to the pulpit and he
[1:12:44] speaks a few words and he said I don't
[1:12:46] need to speak anymore because he's here
[1:12:49] now the Baptist had um had hired these
[1:12:53] two professional uh photographers take
[1:12:56] pictures because he was going to win and
[1:12:58] these pictures would show that he was
[1:12:59] right and all that and so they in fact I
[1:13:03] even spoke to one of them I met him
[1:13:04] years years
[1:13:06] later and uh they um they were taking
[1:13:10] pictures you know they fancy equipment
[1:13:13] but when they went to develop them only
[1:13:15] one picture turned out and it's this one
[1:13:18] here some of you might not have seen
[1:13:20] this but this is a very real photograph
[1:13:24] we have people today saying is fake well
[1:13:25] that's their opinion we know it's real
[1:13:28] and um and so this is the only picture
[1:13:31] that came out you know and then later we
[1:13:34] find out where brother R says uh it's
[1:13:36] better if you have the picture than the
[1:13:38] real thing com in the room because your
[1:13:39] eyes good you know good fool yet and
[1:13:42] then in another place we find out where
[1:13:44] he uh he's I think in at least two
[1:13:46] occasions he's talking about a a sister
[1:13:48] that was in the
[1:13:50] hospital um very very sick now ready to
[1:13:54] die and she had this picture in the on
[1:13:57] in a frame beside her bed in the
[1:13:59] hospital and she her testimony was that
[1:14:01] the fire came off of the picture and
[1:14:03] came over her and she got healed and
[1:14:05] went home so he says it's better to have
[1:14:08] the real one than than if you know the
[1:14:09] picture the real one that came in the
[1:14:11] room well
[1:14:13] anyway God knows what he's doing God has
[1:14:16] ways of of doing things he doesn't need
[1:14:17] our little brain you know Psalm 46:10 be
[1:14:21] still I'm God got all figured out don't
[1:14:24] need your opinion you know well years
[1:14:27] later when Rebecca you know was
[1:14:29] listening to the tape the way we would
[1:14:30] today she um she heard brother R tell
[1:14:33] about the fact that when he was coming
[1:14:35] down he said 500 ushers made a way for
[1:14:37] me to get down here well the only person
[1:14:39] she knew that was in the meeting was her
[1:14:41] mother so she said mom you know you were
[1:14:43] there did you see the the 500 ushers and
[1:14:46] no dear those were
[1:14:48] Angels see that's other dimension that
[1:14:51] we can't see otherwise that got him
[1:14:54] right to the you know at the first row
[1:14:56] back there but God knew what he was
[1:15:00] doing you know and there's many other uh
[1:15:04] instances of what we call a prophetic
[1:15:06] Dimension which is the word I use you
[1:15:08] don't have to use it but uh for example
[1:15:11] whenever his mother-in-law died in
[1:15:13] 1960 um he um you know went through the
[1:15:17] the funeral and bual now they're at the
[1:15:20] house and uh sister ROM's crying and and
[1:15:24] him trying to be a good husband and
[1:15:26] everything well dear what's wrong well
[1:15:28] Bill you don't understand she's so far
[1:15:30] away you know and he said now look I
[1:15:33] can't open your eyes but you'll have to
[1:15:35] believe me she's right there on the end
[1:15:37] of the couch they're only as far away as
[1:15:40] you put them you see now we don't
[1:15:42] believe in spiritualism like the people
[1:15:43] that built this church but we do believe
[1:15:46] in a Hereafter they're waiting for us
[1:15:49] well time goes on and um we'll be
[1:15:54] another hour or so
[1:15:56] lunch is right there we don't have to go
[1:15:57] far we got free parking out here so come
[1:16:01] to the end of
[1:16:03] 1963 and the brandom are going back to
[1:16:06] Indiana for Christmas and he's going to
[1:16:09] speak at the Tabernacle well you guys
[1:16:12] remember maybe you don't but I do when
[1:16:17] when your girlfriend leaves for two
[1:16:19] weeks it's like a year you know just and
[1:16:23] so I hitch a ride with some other people
[1:16:25] and drove straight through and surprised
[1:16:28] them for Sunday December 29th and so I'm
[1:16:32] there at the church and sitting right
[1:16:33] over here to the right of the the the
[1:16:36] pulpit and brother B's preaching oh man
[1:16:39] here we are in the brand Tabernacle and
[1:16:40] all this is going on marvelous you know
[1:16:43] so between Services well I I go to lunch
[1:16:46] with with the brandom's and so we're um
[1:16:49] we're sitting at lunch now he knew that
[1:16:52] we were in school together he knew that
[1:16:53] we were in choir together at the school
[1:16:56] and music and so forth but he said now
[1:16:59] George I want you to sing tonight in
[1:17:01] church said me at the ROM Tabernacle
[1:17:05] yeah what what in the world would I sing
[1:17:08] here and um he said well tonight we're
[1:17:11] going to have a u a healing
[1:17:13] service so it'd be good if you could
[1:17:15] sing then Jesus came well uh I never
[1:17:18] heard that song yeah Baptist Church
[1:17:22] Shame Shame and um so we learned it
[1:17:25] well so he came out to preach and he he
[1:17:30] thank for the song and he was very proud
[1:17:32] that Rebecca had played in church for
[1:17:33] the first time see her her training was
[1:17:35] classical music and so here she played
[1:17:37] and he was very proud of that well he
[1:17:40] came out and preached to look away to
[1:17:42] Jesus well we moved forward to 64 and um
[1:17:46] we graduated together from High School
[1:17:48] if you were going with somebody that
[1:17:49] could be your partner otherwise they'll
[1:17:51] put you according to size you know but
[1:17:53] um so our parents were for sitting in
[1:17:55] the audience they they were very pleased
[1:17:57] and it was a very proud day for brother
[1:17:58] random he said finally brandom has
[1:18:00] graduated you know and there's not been
[1:18:03] another one since you know or the other
[1:18:05] two
[1:18:07] well uh that's May of 64 then in July
[1:18:10] brother Brandon was preaching in in
[1:18:13] Philadelphia at the uh big celebration
[1:18:16] they had for the 4th of July and when a
[1:18:20] person would ride to church with brother
[1:18:23] brandham uh it would be brother brand
[1:18:25] and Billy Paul in the front and then
[1:18:28] Rebecca and her friend Betty were in the
[1:18:30] back and they wouldn't be there for the
[1:18:33] whole service they'd come in in time for
[1:18:35] him to come in to speak and so they got
[1:18:38] there and the place full there's no
[1:18:40] seats anywhere you know so they don't
[1:18:42] know where to put these two girls well
[1:18:44] they found them some seats up the mezzan
[1:18:45] where they could you know see and hear
[1:18:48] and
[1:18:48] um so they're sitting up there well
[1:18:51] brother random comes in and it was a
[1:18:53] long table
[1:18:56] and his his seat let's say was over here
[1:18:58] you know right next to the pulpit and
[1:19:00] brother Roberts is speaking and so while
[1:19:03] brother Roberts is speaking brother
[1:19:05] Brandon reaches out and touches his coat
[1:19:07] you know down at the down at the bottom
[1:19:09] of the of the coat just real real easy
[1:19:13] and um and he looked down and he he
[1:19:16] didn't even match he had the brown coat
[1:19:18] with a blue jacket or what blue pants
[1:19:21] and here's this man in a probably a$1 th
[1:19:23] suit at the time
[1:19:25] and so he preached the mighty message
[1:19:27] you know that that day the Mighty God
[1:19:29] unveiled and
[1:19:30] then when they're leaving the service
[1:19:34] Rebecca said I saw what you did you know
[1:19:37] feeling the coat and he said oh sis you
[1:19:40] wouldn't believe it was such fine fine
[1:19:43] cloth you know I looked down I didn't
[1:19:45] even match well his outfit probably cost
[1:19:48] $49.95 you know but and the other man's
[1:19:50] got a ,000 suit on but they were both
[1:19:52] called of God they both had a different
[1:19:54] job to do and um but but that was just
[1:19:57] to show the difference you know and then
[1:20:00] another time uh I think it's on tape
[1:20:03] where brother brandom uh is speaking in
[1:20:05] a large Auditorium they got the big
[1:20:07] curtain behind him and he said now I
[1:20:09] want to show you here at the end of the
[1:20:10] service the reason for the success of
[1:20:13] these meetings and he had him raised a
[1:20:15] curtain and there on the floor was old
[1:20:18] John Ryan with a white beard all
[1:20:19] stretched out praying he says that's the
[1:20:21] reason of success because brother REM
[1:20:24] didn't have a push button Ministry it
[1:20:26] all depended on
[1:20:28] prayer okay so we got to tell you a
[1:20:30] little bit about the courtship I mean
[1:20:32] this is you know long time ago um and
[1:20:36] just like you guys don't want to tell
[1:20:38] all secrets of your courtship either do
[1:20:41] you might tell barries but not
[1:20:45] yours so we couldn't have any dates
[1:20:47] during the week because we're in
[1:20:49] school and uh when I did bring her home
[1:20:52] I had to be you know be 11 o'clock
[1:20:55] and then we had church on Sunday and so
[1:20:57] forth and so I would bring her home and
[1:21:01] they Liv in duplex apartment right on
[1:21:03] the street there was no gated community
[1:21:05] or anything and so we U were standing on
[1:21:09] the porch and trying to say good night
[1:21:11] and everything all of a sudden the light
[1:21:12] comes on big porch light right here and
[1:21:15] so what in the world so a little hand
[1:21:17] comes out if I put a quarter in the hand
[1:21:20] hand goes back in the light goes
[1:21:22] off it's pretty simple formula
[1:21:25] yeah that was my young brother-in-law's
[1:21:28] earliest adventur separating Believers
[1:21:31] from their cash you
[1:21:32] know and uh so at our house we had a a
[1:21:38] black phone on the wall with a
[1:21:40] dial and my dad of course raising all
[1:21:42] these kids he said now the telephone is
[1:21:45] for uh is for uh communication not for
[1:21:50] visiting well that makes sense unless he
[1:21:53] needed to visit and it was different you
[1:21:54] know he always said we have a democracy
[1:21:57] here I have the vote that's what he rant
[1:22:01] things um but at the brandom house by
[1:22:04] the time they're hooking up their phone
[1:22:06] in '
[1:22:07] 63 we had the push button phone but it's
[1:22:10] still connected to the wall they didn't
[1:22:11] have you know walkway phones and you
[1:22:14] know we we like we heard last night
[1:22:17] these weren't invented yet this is the
[1:22:19] most marvelous thing ever there's more
[1:22:21] power here than in the what they sent to
[1:22:24] the Moon Moon you know but nevertheless
[1:22:27] and we were young we like to talk on the
[1:22:29] phone we only lived a block away but
[1:22:30] still it's just something about it well
[1:22:33] so brother R has this phone every you
[1:22:36] know different people got the number and
[1:22:38] they been calling for everything you
[1:22:40] know brother R should I buy the white
[1:22:41] car or the red now if they ask me I
[1:22:45] don't care but they didn't ask me and so
[1:22:47] he talks to him well he got tired of
[1:22:49] that so he's looking at the phone one
[1:22:52] day well on the bottom of the phone on
[1:22:54] the back side there was a dial and if
[1:22:56] you dialed it one way the ringer was
[1:22:58] louder and if you dialed the other way
[1:23:00] it was off what do you think you did
[1:23:02] turned it off enough of that nonsense so
[1:23:05] you calling him you call in the house
[1:23:07] and you could hear it ringing but he
[1:23:09] can't hear it ringing off and so Rebecca
[1:23:12] is oh what are you going to do said it
[1:23:14] looks real simple remember we're like uh
[1:23:18] 17 18 at the time and I said look you
[1:23:21] you set your your uh watch just like
[1:23:24] mine okay okay got it now at 7:00 Lord
[1:23:28] willing I'm going to call you but thanks
[1:23:30] to your dad it's not going to ring so at
[1:23:32] 7:00 you pick it
[1:23:33] up I was there and so I had a long cord
[1:23:38] to the wall so she could take that phone
[1:23:40] and go in the closet and shut the door
[1:23:41] and we had some privacy so you see love
[1:23:44] conquers
[1:23:46] all and um so here I am with this four
[1:23:51] or 5-year-old truck uh no air
[1:23:53] conditioning no nothing well you've been
[1:23:55] there owna some of you and 100° in the
[1:23:57] summertime so sometimes he would offer
[1:23:59] us his Cadillac wow that was like a big
[1:24:03] Mercedes today and so why did he have a
[1:24:06] Cadillac he never wanted a Cadillac the
[1:24:09] Christian businessman offered him yeah
[1:24:10] we going to buy you a new Cadillac every
[1:24:12] year just like we do so and so no not me
[1:24:14] he he normally drove a Ford station
[1:24:17] wagon and he'd drive it for two years
[1:24:20] and then he would trade it in for a new
[1:24:21] one because of high mileage well so out
[1:24:25] in California there was a man named
[1:24:26] arganbright he was the treasur of the
[1:24:29] Christian
[1:24:30] businessmen and without asking brother
[1:24:32] random he was getting his new Cadillac
[1:24:35] uh at the end of
[1:24:37] 55 getting his new 56 Cadillac so he
[1:24:40] gives the keys to the 55 Cadillac to
[1:24:43] these two flunkies now look guys drive
[1:24:45] this to this address you park it don't
[1:24:47] talk to anybody come home so they did
[1:24:50] well brother Ren comes home one day
[1:24:52] here's this huge CAD like from here to
[1:24:53] the wall it's beautiful I mean it's a
[1:24:56] big four-door Fleetwood with two four
[1:24:59] barrel carburetors and it was huge and
[1:25:02] had a great air conditioning so he put
[1:25:04] it in the garage you know real quick and
[1:25:07] then eventually he put a little ad in
[1:25:08] the paper and said now look I'm going to
[1:25:10] be driving this car you're going to see
[1:25:11] me drivve in this car I didn't buy it
[1:25:13] with your money this was a gift you know
[1:25:14] on and on and it was great for traveling
[1:25:17] so he had offered this Cadillac to us so
[1:25:19] we could go out well back then uh some
[1:25:23] of you remember the gas that I would buy
[1:25:26] for my truck was 22 cents a
[1:25:29] gallon that's like what 5 cents a liter
[1:25:33] anyway but for the Cadillac had to buy
[1:25:35] the expensive gas was 36 Cents a gallon
[1:25:38] and there was no self- pump you had to
[1:25:40] pull in the guy comes out and um so we'
[1:25:43] to get $2 worth Big
[1:25:46] Spenders and um so anyway we were
[1:25:50] attending the Baptist Church and uh in
[1:25:53] my truck well I'd come by to get her so
[1:25:56] I'm driving and here's Rebecca and
[1:25:58] there's my sister who's 2 years younger
[1:25:59] than me and the other four or five kids
[1:26:02] are in the back no top just you know
[1:26:04] going to church and so brother R would
[1:26:07] come out to see us sometimes he always
[1:26:09] tell us goodbye if he was home sometimes
[1:26:11] you go with us and one time he comes out
[1:26:13] and he he you know sees us and my what a
[1:26:16] fine load of young preachers you have
[1:26:18] here I didn't see no young preachers I
[1:26:20] saw young brat Brothers you know but uh
[1:26:24] he could see farther than I could see
[1:26:26] well sure enough they all became good
[1:26:28] baptist ministers until this day and so
[1:26:32] uh uh life rocks on here we are in '
[1:26:37] 64 and U Rebecca told us one time about
[1:26:40] they were in a
[1:26:41] restaurant and there was a
[1:26:44] policeman uh you know at the other table
[1:26:47] and as soon as his food came well his
[1:26:50] radio started making noise and he had to
[1:26:52] go and he left the food and goes out
[1:26:54] buzzes away with a light flashing
[1:26:57] brother Brand's still eating everybody
[1:26:58] else kind of nervous and so brother
[1:27:00] brand said now um don't worry little boy
[1:27:04] fell out of a tree here a few blocks
[1:27:05] away and he's going to be okay and
[1:27:08] Rebecca said now we knew that
[1:27:09] everybody's daddy didn't do
[1:27:11] that so they had interesting life and
[1:27:16] um then towards the end of 64 the Lord
[1:27:19] spoke to him said look you need to find
[1:27:20] a house because you're going to stay so
[1:27:23] up to then you know most all 63 and 64
[1:27:26] they'd been in this apartment and uh not
[1:27:29] knowing what the future held kids in
[1:27:31] school and so forth he's traveling
[1:27:33] preaching and so he starts looking for a
[1:27:35] house and
[1:27:37] he felt you know the holy spirit's
[1:27:40] directed him to this kisac you know one
[1:27:42] way in one way in one way out and
[1:27:44] there's these three houses up there that
[1:27:46] this old man had built and almost
[1:27:49] finished him but he thought well we'll
[1:27:50] let the owners finish it the way they
[1:27:53] want it and so brother brand was very
[1:27:55] much attracted to one of the houses he
[1:27:57] could see the mountains very clearly he
[1:27:59] liked and there was room on the property
[1:28:01] to add on the den room that he always
[1:28:03] dreamed about to have his trophies you
[1:28:06] know because he was a
[1:28:07] hunter okay so they made the deal well
[1:28:10] so brother Brandon was standing in in
[1:28:12] the doorway looking out and the Builder
[1:28:15] standing outside they're talking and
[1:28:18] while they're talking uh here's little
[1:28:21] Joseph about what eight or nine years
[1:28:23] old at the time and you know how kids
[1:28:25] run their hand up the door jam always
[1:28:27] sticking fingers where they don't belong
[1:28:29] and so he's headed for the the door jam
[1:28:32] you know the hole so brother brand was
[1:28:34] talking to this man and without even
[1:28:37] flinching or anything he reaches in his
[1:28:38] pocket and gets his knife and opens it
[1:28:40] up and sticks it in the hole brings out
[1:28:42] a scorpion and Joseph was headed towards
[1:28:45] that so see those kind of things okay
[1:28:48] something's different here this isn't
[1:28:49] the ordinary guy and um so they made the
[1:28:54] de and then all of 65 they're adding on
[1:28:56] the den room they're bringing the
[1:28:58] animals from from Indiana to put on the
[1:29:00] wall and finishing the house the carpet
[1:29:04] I even helped them with some of the
[1:29:05] furniture and things and um so that was
[1:29:08] most of 65
[1:29:10] well um in May of 65 okay I've been out
[1:29:14] of school for a year and I didn't have
[1:29:17] the right baptism didn't have the Holy
[1:29:19] Ghost uh didn't have a job didn't have
[1:29:21] money didn't have a car didn't have a
[1:29:23] house mean
[1:29:25] that was just the next bum on the street
[1:29:26] really but I I knew he was a Prophet by
[1:29:29] then and I thought I needed a
[1:29:32] wife you know hey wait till you have a
[1:29:35] few things to offer you know so so I go
[1:29:39] and and uh made an appointment okay he's
[1:29:41] not busy I go in and talk to
[1:29:43] him and so uh the two of us sitting
[1:29:47] there and um uh he he commences to tell
[1:29:50] me about all these trips I don't know
[1:29:52] what all kinds of details
[1:29:55] and finally after a long what seemed
[1:29:56] like a long time I said now brother Ram
[1:29:58] I'm here for a purpose you know I have
[1:30:00] something on my mind of course he's
[1:30:02] looking right through me you know and I
[1:30:04] said well you must noticed how I really
[1:30:07] uh in love with your daughter and I'm
[1:30:09] here to ask for your permission and your
[1:30:11] blessing to marry Rebecca well
[1:30:13] everything changed then eyes got real
[1:30:16] narrow and um he uh he said well I tell
[1:30:20] you what course he knew my condition he
[1:30:24] said I'll give you guys permission to be
[1:30:26] engaged but don't even think about
[1:30:28] marriage until you both receive the
[1:30:31] baptism of the Holy
[1:30:32] Ghost yes sir now a smart person okay
[1:30:35] what's step number one you know no life
[1:30:38] goes
[1:30:39] on and so here again that's in May so in
[1:30:43] the summer they go off for two months I
[1:30:46] don't know how I got back there but I
[1:30:47] was back there for about 3 weeks and
[1:30:49] that was when he was preaching and only
[1:30:50] ones at the end time and I was sitting
[1:30:52] from here about far closer than the
[1:30:55] piano listen to that message it was
[1:30:57] going right over you know few people
[1:30:59] were listening to the details of what he
[1:31:00] was preaching and um several other very
[1:31:04] important messages well so he preached
[1:31:06] on August the 1st of 65 and he he
[1:31:09] addressed baptism like
[1:31:11] normally so that night I said hey now I
[1:31:15] know we're going to be getting in the
[1:31:16] station wagon and going west this week
[1:31:19] will there be time before we go that you
[1:31:21] can baptize me correctly you know
[1:31:24] Christian baptism oh sure sure well he
[1:31:27] had been waiting you know over two years
[1:31:28] for that and so on Monday August 2nd we
[1:31:32] uh went down to the church and he
[1:31:34] baptized me and turned out that was the
[1:31:36] last person he baptized which didn't
[1:31:38] know at the time and um so then you know
[1:31:41] my life started changing so now we're
[1:31:44] back in
[1:31:45] Tucson in uh August of
[1:31:49] 65 and okay now I had the girl under
[1:31:52] contract I had the B ISM I had a car
[1:31:55] things are looking better you know and
[1:31:58] so we're driving around in my car and uh
[1:32:01] all of a sudden he says now George if
[1:32:02] you ever get the opportunity to go to
[1:32:05] Israel your Bible will be a new book
[1:32:08] well thank you I wasn't thinking about
[1:32:09] Israel I thinking about the girl got to
[1:32:12] be
[1:32:13] honest and um so sure enough you know
[1:32:18] prophets could see way in the future uh
[1:32:20] this last June just a year ago was our
[1:32:23] last last trip that we made might go
[1:32:26] again we don't know but that was trip
[1:32:28] number 48 and brother Gerald and sister
[1:32:30] Betty were on one of our trips and it's
[1:32:32] a life-changing experience I mean it's a
[1:32:34] very small country very small it's not
[1:32:38] like Canada um see when when God divided
[1:32:41] up the
[1:32:43] land Isaac had 12 sons and Israel had 12
[1:32:47] sons so he divided up the land and
[1:32:50] Israel's people got a few more square
[1:32:52] miles than
[1:32:54] Isaac's people and they've been fighting
[1:32:56] ever since and so because of the wars
[1:32:59] and the politics Israel is now living on
[1:33:02] 177% of the original
[1:33:05] land and who knows what's going to
[1:33:07] happen in the future but it's my
[1:33:10] understanding from scripture that Israel
[1:33:11] will end up all by itself with no
[1:33:13] friends and it's headed that way so
[1:33:16] anyway that was about about August in
[1:33:20] September brother R speaking in Phoenix
[1:33:23] and he's a big hotel and so Rebecca and
[1:33:25] I drive up there I let her out at the
[1:33:27] door and I go park the car well she
[1:33:29] walks into this this big uh hotel where
[1:33:33] this meeting
[1:33:34] is and her friend Sharon is back there
[1:33:37] waiting for her and so you know when
[1:33:39] girl gets engaged seems like the hand is
[1:33:41] always up here someplace you know they
[1:33:44] see the
[1:33:45] ring and so Sharon Cesar from a long
[1:33:48] ways off and she says is this about
[1:33:51] George that Baptist guy yeah but she he
[1:33:55] says she said Rebecca he he's he's a
[1:33:58] Baptist and Rebecca said yeah have a
[1:34:01] daddy likes
[1:34:02] him and a
[1:34:04] problem so later in September um brother
[1:34:09] B's finishing up the house and brother
[1:34:12] green out in
[1:34:14] Texas uh his mother was a seamstress and
[1:34:17] brother Perry had collected some money
[1:34:18] privately to put the drapes in the house
[1:34:22] so he was in town and in Tucson hanging
[1:34:25] the drapes he had a couple Services
[1:34:27] there and so brother uh brandham says to
[1:34:30] him now look brother Perry it looks like
[1:34:33] this kid's going to be my son-in-law
[1:34:35] take him home pray for the Holy Ghost
[1:34:37] now why didn't brother BR just put his
[1:34:39] hand on me and be done no it didn't work
[1:34:41] that way so I go home with him and um
[1:34:44] back to Texas now when you think you
[1:34:47] have bad weather Texas is the worst it's
[1:34:51] always humid you're always you know
[1:34:53] drenched so I go over there and visit
[1:34:55] with him about the second day I'm there
[1:34:59] brother Blair from Louisiana came over
[1:35:01] to use brother Green's phone to call
[1:35:02] brother brandom and when he called he
[1:35:05] was already out of the house but they
[1:35:06] put him on the list soon as he comes
[1:35:08] back he'll call you so here's these two
[1:35:10] brothers waiting for the phone call you
[1:35:13] know I'm over in my room reading my
[1:35:15] Bible I think and so I uh I just felt
[1:35:18] inspired hey they're both over there
[1:35:20] doing nothing why don't we just have
[1:35:22] prayer so we KNE at a bench in the
[1:35:25] Sunday School room I think it
[1:35:26] was and so we're
[1:35:29] praying and they knew who I was why I
[1:35:32] was there I didn't know I was there
[1:35:33] seeking the Holy Ghost they knew that
[1:35:34] but I didn't know that and so while
[1:35:36] we're praying it um it seemed like I
[1:35:39] could see with my eyes clothes you know
[1:35:41] a cloudy sky high clouds Sun peeking in
[1:35:45] like pencil you know certain areas and
[1:35:48] uh and that's what I remember well then
[1:35:50] the phone rang so it was brother Brandon
[1:35:52] calling for brother Blair but it was
[1:35:54] brother Green's phone so he goes to
[1:35:56] answer the phone and uh but brother
[1:35:58] brand says but I want to talk to George
[1:36:00] first okay so I go and greet him he says
[1:36:03] I want to be the first to congratulate
[1:36:05] you on receiving the baptism of Holy
[1:36:07] Ghost so he knew how hardheaded I was
[1:36:10] and he knew what was going on even
[1:36:12] though he's thousand miles away and he
[1:36:14] was identifying this experience and sure
[1:36:17] enough from then on it just got bigger
[1:36:19] and bigger well the next day I get a a
[1:36:22] letter call from my mother also in
[1:36:25] Arizona and uh I had received a letter
[1:36:28] from the President Johnson that they
[1:36:31] needed me in the military because of the
[1:36:33] war and so forth well I had Mexican
[1:36:37] citizenship I could have took off to
[1:36:40] Mexico and forget the whole thing no you
[1:36:42] give Caesar what Caesars and um So
[1:36:46] within a week I was a US Soldier with
[1:36:49] baptism of Holy Ghost and God protected
[1:36:52] me during those two years in the service
[1:36:56] well come to November of
[1:36:58] 65 and um brother B's preaching in
[1:37:01] shreport which was only an hour and a
[1:37:03] half from where I was in the Army so
[1:37:05] Rebecca came down I got a pass able to
[1:37:08] go up there for for a couple of days and
[1:37:10] so on Saturday morning I had a uh few
[1:37:13] minutes with brother brandom and I said
[1:37:15] you know I don't know what they're going
[1:37:17] to do with me I just finished basic
[1:37:18] training I don't know what what's going
[1:37:20] to happen because there was some things
[1:37:23] very serious serious things going on in
[1:37:24] the world and he said George don't worry
[1:37:28] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:37:29] of the Lord didn't pray didn't say I see
[1:37:32] a vision no nothing just quote of
[1:37:35] scripture so um that same day Saturday
[1:37:40] nights when he preached I've heard but
[1:37:41] now I see well
[1:37:46] um I was home
[1:37:48] for Christmas holidays in ' 65 they let
[1:37:52] us go from the Army
[1:37:54] and I'm home with my family and the plan
[1:37:57] was randoms were going to go to
[1:38:00] Jeffersonville he was going to preach
[1:38:01] Christmas and then come back he had to
[1:38:03] collect his new car because he ordered
[1:38:06] the 1966 station wagon and then come
[1:38:09] back and move into the new house so
[1:38:11] they're going to leave Rebecca in town
[1:38:13] to move the stuff from the apartment
[1:38:15] where they've been for almost three
[1:38:17] years now over to the new house and get
[1:38:19] it all ready so when they came back they
[1:38:21] can move right in well now when brother
[1:38:23] r
[1:38:24] traveled he had some very um uh fast
[1:38:28] rules you
[1:38:32] know one of them was that we got to
[1:38:34] leave early so at 6:00 we're leaving
[1:38:37] we're rolling you all go to sleep it's
[1:38:39] fine but we're going to get there so
[1:38:41] that mean he's leaving very early and
[1:38:44] the other thing was that if he traveled
[1:38:46] by himself or with Billy they just wear
[1:38:49] blue jeans and some boots and whatever
[1:38:52] but if he was with the family he'd dress
[1:38:54] up a little bit you know and the third
[1:38:56] thing was that that he always uh placed
[1:39:00] the Bible as the last thing in the
[1:39:02] suitcase that way nothing's on top of
[1:39:04] the Bible which makes good sense and on
[1:39:07] tape he says you don't put anything on
[1:39:09] top of your Bible not even my books
[1:39:11] which he had very few books at the time
[1:39:13] and so he had that respect and that that
[1:39:16] way he way he
[1:39:17] functioned well I was young but I wasn't
[1:39:20] you know quite crazy so I wasn't going
[1:39:22] to go up there at 5: in the morning so I
[1:39:24] went up the night of the 17th of
[1:39:26] December to say goodbye and you know uh
[1:39:29] say goodbye to him and so we're in the
[1:39:31] bedroom by ourselves and on the chair by
[1:39:34] the by the door is his boots and blue
[1:39:37] jeans and things for the next day and I
[1:39:39] knew what his rules were and I said
[1:39:41] what's this all about he said well guy
[1:39:44] never knows when he might have car
[1:39:46] trouble I thought to myself hm this guy
[1:39:48] never has car trouble he kept it you
[1:39:51] know
[1:39:51] pristine um
[1:39:53] he didn't say nothing about him but by
[1:39:57] the time Saturday night came along cuz
[1:39:58] that was 17th was Friday night by the
[1:40:01] time Saturday evening came around he was
[1:40:03] already in a head-on collision which is
[1:40:04] a whole another story but we were able
[1:40:07] to go up there on Sunday to Texas where
[1:40:09] he was and um very serious they had his
[1:40:13] all bandaged had a tra in him he
[1:40:15] couldn't talk and during the six days
[1:40:17] that he was in the
[1:40:19] hospital like I say no cell phones the
[1:40:21] only phones on the wall how many
[1:40:23] quarters you have and brother Perry was
[1:40:25] taking care of the phone calls but um
[1:40:28] during those 6 days I got into to see
[1:40:31] him once and there was 12 beds in the
[1:40:35] ICU and during those six days all the
[1:40:39] other 11 beds got better and moved on
[1:40:41] but on the night of the 24th of December
[1:40:44] God said that's enough took him home we
[1:40:47] weren't ready for that we didn't expect
[1:40:49] that and at first we were like the
[1:40:53] disciples you know desponded now what
[1:40:55] are we going to do there's no leader
[1:40:56] nobody fill his shoes and you know all
[1:40:58] this stuff going on but you know brother
[1:41:00] R says you're going to find out one of
[1:41:02] these days that when you go to heaven
[1:41:04] you don't fly off somewhere else you're
[1:41:06] still right here just in another
[1:41:08] dimension faster than this so it's only
[1:41:12] as far away as you want to imagine you
[1:41:14] know well so now we got all this
[1:41:18] confusion going on trying to settle it
[1:41:20] down trying to get back level and
[1:41:23] we traveled to Jeffersonville on on some
[1:41:26] U hired planes I couldn't stay for the
[1:41:29] funeral I wasn't a blood relative I had
[1:41:31] to get back to the Army but I had a
[1:41:33] funeral service on the 29th of December
[1:41:37] of
[1:41:38] 65 and um but sister brandham had
[1:41:42] suffered greatly in the in the accident
[1:41:44] she no doubt was was dead but she was
[1:41:48] back but she had a concussion Billy was
[1:41:50] very young he couldn't make any
[1:41:51] decisions so the can't decide where to
[1:41:53] bury him whether here in jonville or out
[1:41:56] here where our new life is in Tucson so
[1:41:58] the funeral director said don't worry I
[1:42:00] got a place I can keep him when you
[1:42:02] decide you let me know well life goes on
[1:42:06] I'm I'm out of the picture I'm I'm in
[1:42:07] the Army you know in fact they're
[1:42:10] training me to be a cook yeah for
[1:42:13] minimum 100 people we know the word says
[1:42:15] in second Timothy for God is not given
[1:42:17] us a spirit of fear but of power and
[1:42:19] love and a sound mind and Paul wrote
[1:42:22] over in Philippians and the peace of God
[1:42:24] which passes all the things you can
[1:42:26] understand will keep your hearts and
[1:42:28] Minds through Christ Jesus the whole
[1:42:30] thing comes down to Jesus Christ you
[1:42:34] know so we're learning to listen we're
[1:42:37] learning to uh read for ourselves
[1:42:39] learning to pray and we became I think
[1:42:42] generally we became anchored in the word
[1:42:45] uh the prophetic word and the written
[1:42:47] word uh you see the message that we
[1:42:51] Proclaim is only the implified version
[1:42:53] of scripture it fits here perfectly we
[1:42:56] don't have to say yeah but brother BR
[1:42:58] said no it's all part of it it's all one
[1:43:00] big book you know and uh God was on the
[1:43:03] scene with God there's no
[1:43:06] surprises I'm away you know all this is
[1:43:09] going on back east and the missionary
[1:43:12] work started to begin spreading the
[1:43:14] message it's not like the people that
[1:43:16] come to your house door you know two by
[1:43:18] two and try to sell you stuff no they
[1:43:21] people saw the the changed lives
[1:43:23] they saw the change lives of Gerald and
[1:43:25] all these other people hey I want what
[1:43:27] you have you know so uh small group
[1:43:30] started to form well when we get to
[1:43:32] March of
[1:43:34] 66 um I had my training finished and I
[1:43:39] already had papers I knew where I was
[1:43:40] going and so I called Rebecca one day
[1:43:44] and I said um let's get married next
[1:43:46] week next Wednesday okay let's do it
[1:43:49] well so I go back Tucson we have a
[1:43:51] private ceremony to house with families
[1:43:54] my mother couldn't be there for the the
[1:43:57] wedding of her firstborn because she was
[1:43:59] in false labor with number
[1:44:02] 10 I'm not a woman but you'd think
[1:44:05] after you'd know but anyway um so we had
[1:44:09] a private ceremony then we uh traveled
[1:44:13] back to jonville for the burial which is
[1:44:16] going to be on April 15th or April 11th
[1:44:19] rather so that was our honeymoon and so
[1:44:22] we uh we get back there and and come uh
[1:44:26] Monday April 11th and I have the you
[1:44:29] know organize the burial service well in
[1:44:32] Indiana it can rain just gently for two
[1:44:35] or three days at a time you know well
[1:44:38] this is one of those occasions just
[1:44:40] rainy and um so Billy Paul had always
[1:44:44] stayed close to his grandmother which
[1:44:46] was Hope's mother and she was a very
[1:44:48] very difficult person very hard never
[1:44:50] been to church he never saw her cry
[1:44:52] never saw any emotion but he left his
[1:44:54] two little boys with Grandma while he
[1:44:57] went to the burial okay Monday morning
[1:45:00] and when he comes back from the burial
[1:45:03] uh for the first time he sees his
[1:45:05] grandmother wiping her
[1:45:07] eyes and um she said you know even the
[1:45:10] heavens weep for that
[1:45:12] man after all those
[1:45:15] years well we left that afternoon flew
[1:45:18] to
[1:45:19] California and on the 15th of April I
[1:45:22] got on plane with a bunch of other guys
[1:45:24] like me and went to Vietnam for one year
[1:45:28] and so back then we didn't have didn't
[1:45:30] have phones didn't have FaceTime all we
[1:45:33] had was letters no vacation one year
[1:45:37] that's it but God was keeping us you
[1:45:40] know she was busy taking care of her
[1:45:43] mother and and brother and sister I was
[1:45:45] busy cooking for 500 people you know
[1:45:48] over there and um but it was a trial by
[1:45:51] fire but God Spirit kept us you know so
[1:45:55] after two years in the military I began
[1:45:58] working with the translation of the
[1:45:59] message into Spanish now the first
[1:46:01] translation we did was a small track uh
[1:46:04] he ascended on high and give gifts unto
[1:46:06] men small track a lady had produced and
[1:46:09] she asked if I would do it in Spanish
[1:46:11] well I did that when I was still in high
[1:46:12] school brother Bram saw it he was he was
[1:46:14] you know pleased with it so when I get
[1:46:16] out of the
[1:46:17] military uh they had a spot for me at
[1:46:20] spoken word Publications to Simply set
[1:46:23] type and so I can see something's wrong
[1:46:26] with this translation that somebody did
[1:46:28] and so I go back to the table sure
[1:46:29] enough some things were left out so it
[1:46:31] would start all over again so all these
[1:46:33] years we've been involved in getting
[1:46:35] brother brandham into this other
[1:46:38] language where people can imagine that
[1:46:41] he's speaking Spanish see we read our
[1:46:43] Bible and we you know we get in there
[1:46:45] and we imagine that Peter speaking
[1:46:47] English well he didn't speak English you
[1:46:49] know so and and all these words of Jesus
[1:46:51] and read well that's good there might
[1:46:53] have been some more this is what what
[1:46:55] came down so we're trying to Simply put
[1:46:58] William brandham in another language
[1:47:01] where they can have the same blessing we
[1:47:03] have you know that's been our priority
[1:47:07] well today uh it's much different we've
[1:47:11] got all translated and I'm working very
[1:47:14] closely with brother Barry in getting it
[1:47:16] printed in China get it distributed all
[1:47:18] over Latin America and that's that's
[1:47:20] kind of the current situation but if we
[1:47:24] fast forward 40 years now uh we get to
[1:47:27] October of of' 06 and by this time
[1:47:30] Rebecca was very very ill she had had um
[1:47:34] a kidney removed along with the tumor
[1:47:37] which the whole thing was about the size
[1:47:38] of a football now there was much prayer
[1:47:41] people everywhere was praying there was
[1:47:43] much faith and this wasn't just anybody
[1:47:45] this somebody that lived with William
[1:47:46] Brandon for 19 years she knew what
[1:47:48] Miracles were she knew what faith was
[1:47:50] better than I did and um but I can see
[1:47:52] here you know going down every day and I
[1:47:55] said now look God can certainly raise
[1:47:57] you up the next 20 minutes you can be
[1:47:59] brand new you've seen it happen but if
[1:48:03] God chooses to take you home then you
[1:48:06] find your dad and you wait for me there
[1:48:08] okay
[1:48:09] well um so I've got a very serious
[1:48:12] appointment a few days later in October
[1:48:14] of 06 uh a friend of ours back in uh
[1:48:19] Virginia a young lady she called and she
[1:48:22] said you know you know uh I was getting
[1:48:24] up from lunch today and right across the
[1:48:26] table was this Vision he say it's only
[1:48:28] happened twice in my life and here there
[1:48:30] was this Vision here's all these people
[1:48:32] and brother Brandon preaching Faith to
[1:48:33] him and here's a prayer line and all
[1:48:35] this is going on and then he says and
[1:48:38] all of a sudden he raised his hand and
[1:48:40] you little sister thank you for praying
[1:48:42] for my daughter Rebecca and tell George
[1:48:44] everything's going to be okay well when
[1:48:47] you hear your name from the other
[1:48:49] dimension you tend to pay attention you
[1:48:51] know and so I okay it's going to be okay
[1:48:53] maybe not the way I want it but Hebrews
[1:48:56] 13:8 is still in effect
[1:48:59] so November the 28th of ' 06 uh the Lord
[1:49:03] took her home and uh after the funeral I
[1:49:07] remember praying I said Lord keep me
[1:49:09] keep me busy and keep me balanced and
[1:49:11] keep me focused so the focus is beyond
[1:49:13] the curtain of time it's just ahead you
[1:49:17] know we're keep staying very busy we've
[1:49:19] been all over the world uh just like
[1:49:22] this trying to increase encourage the
[1:49:23] bride now we have other we have a whole
[1:49:25] Bible full of messages we don't just
[1:49:27] give the testimony but balance is very
[1:49:30] essential even in your life whether
[1:49:32] you're young or old in your food and
[1:49:35] everything you do I mean these nice cars
[1:49:38] they got to be balanced they don't work
[1:49:39] right you know so uh you know for every
[1:49:43] one of us there's a there's a line in
[1:49:44] the
[1:49:45] road you won't go past that line you can
[1:49:48] eat all the broccoli you want you're not
[1:49:51] going past the line
[1:49:53] we don't know where the line is but God
[1:49:54] knows and if you check the obituaries
[1:49:57] they didn't all die at 90 years old you
[1:50:00] know so only God knows and um we were
[1:50:03] married just over 40 years we had three
[1:50:06] children two boys and a girl we have now
[1:50:09] three grandchildren now I finally got a
[1:50:12] granddaughter yeah because she married
[1:50:14] in so like it or not I'm related to
[1:50:18] Pastor John because it's his niece and
[1:50:21] it's my granddaughter so um uh a lot of
[1:50:25] times when I'm in churches and there's
[1:50:27] time they uh they want to ask questions
[1:50:30] well I was in a church in Congo not too
[1:50:32] long ago
[1:50:33] and there's about 5,000 people I'm the
[1:50:37] only white person you know so got speak
[1:50:40] in English translators speak in lingala
[1:50:43] and so as soon as I finished well the
[1:50:44] pastor jumps up and he said now um we
[1:50:47] don't know when brother George is coming
[1:50:49] back has anybody got a
[1:50:51] question yeah I got got a lot of
[1:50:53] questions well they ask the question in
[1:50:55] one language he translates it and then
[1:50:57] here's the answer and so it takes time
[1:50:59] but all they have is time they're not
[1:51:00] like us here's here's a church of 5,000
[1:51:03] people or more you look outside and
[1:51:06] there's maybe 10 cars and there's um
[1:51:09] there's probably 200
[1:51:11] motorcycles cheap ones and about 500
[1:51:15] bicycles everybody else walked so time
[1:51:17] means nothing and so the only question I
[1:51:20] remember uh the one sister sent up a
[1:51:24] question she said now since the Lord
[1:51:26] took your wife why you still wearing the
[1:51:27] ring I thought man these people notice
[1:51:29] everything you know you and uh I said
[1:51:32] well because my commitment to Rebecca
[1:51:34] wasn't until death to you part but it's
[1:51:36] forever oh okay now we understand so
[1:51:40] that's why we're at the Ring of course
[1:51:41] it has a secondary uh purpose that I
[1:51:45] can't share with everybody but that's to
[1:51:47] scare away desperate women because
[1:51:49] there's some out
[1:51:51] there so God's keeping us very busy and
[1:51:54] uh with the translation work but it's
[1:51:58] kind of it's all done now we just got to
[1:51:59] get it printed and get in their hands
[1:52:01] but the missionary work is evolved more
[1:52:04] now to humanitarian work because we got
[1:52:06] people in like right now in Brazil
[1:52:09] there's
[1:52:10] flooding rain rain rain it's up to the
[1:52:13] second story in some places okay I know
[1:52:16] of 300 families they had to flee and
[1:52:18] they lost everything Believers and who
[1:52:21] knows how many others so got to help
[1:52:24] them and then there's also the the
[1:52:26] people in Honduras that are some are
[1:52:28] very busy in missionary work uh we got
[1:52:32] one brother that he's
[1:52:35] Fearless he hears from people way up on
[1:52:38] the mountain someplace so they get in a
[1:52:40] boat it's not a boat like your thinking
[1:52:42] it's a Dugout canoe it's a log that's
[1:52:44] been hollowed out it's 30 ft long and
[1:52:46] about so wide and they'll go down the
[1:52:49] river with a motor on the back for eight
[1:52:51] hours and then get on a horse go eight
[1:52:54] hours up into the mountains and finally
[1:52:56] get there people anxious to hear the
[1:52:58] word there's baptism and that goes on
[1:53:01] every
[1:53:02] week uh there's people in in um in
[1:53:05] Malawi central Africa that are very uh
[1:53:10] good at missionary work they have these
[1:53:12] two motorcycles you know they're like
[1:53:14] 200s or whatever they are they're
[1:53:16] cheap two guys get on and they go into
[1:53:19] the mountain regions and preach the
[1:53:21] gospel to these people they have
[1:53:23] baptisms that's going on all the time
[1:53:26] and we're we're helping them with that
[1:53:27] and so things are happening so when
[1:53:30] somebody tells you that there's no more
[1:53:32] blood on the mercy SE they're lying
[1:53:34] because God is still calling God is
[1:53:35] still calling these people they're
[1:53:37] baptized they're coming in still it's
[1:53:39] still going on in Venezuela where it's
[1:53:42] so poor um it's poor for the for the
[1:53:46] people I know because see what communism
[1:53:49] does it erases the middle class you have
[1:53:51] the rich people
[1:53:53] they just get better you know because
[1:53:55] the drugs and so forth and the poor
[1:53:57] people there's a lot of them but there's
[1:53:59] no middle class so the poor people that
[1:54:01] we know they can't afford because
[1:54:03] groceries are up a
[1:54:05] th% you know and it's going to be a
[1:54:07] different price next week so we're
[1:54:08] trying to help them with groceries it's
[1:54:10] like maybe uh six or between six and 10
[1:54:13] families with groceries have a roof over
[1:54:15] their head and um so there's these
[1:54:18] people that are being baptized they
[1:54:20] don't have any clothes they they're say
[1:54:22] shorts or whatever they have that's
[1:54:23] that's all they have so we send them we
[1:54:26] send them clothes we have people that
[1:54:27] are making clothes and donating clothes
[1:54:29] in America we sent it down there we got
[1:54:31] a safe way to get stuff and they're
[1:54:34] happy oh wow another box it's like
[1:54:36] Christmas you know and so a lot of
[1:54:39] things like that are going on that we're
[1:54:41] helping with but my humble advice to you
[1:54:43] today you guys that are married make her
[1:54:46] happy that's all you got do make her
[1:54:49] laugh if she's only laughing at your
[1:54:51] crazy jokes it's okay make her
[1:54:56] happy and you know a lot of times we
[1:54:58] talk about um the idea of marriage is
[1:55:01] 50/50 even in Spanish we have the idea
[1:55:04] of the other half of the orange you
[1:55:05] found her but you see it's much more
[1:55:08] than that because if you if you figure
[1:55:10] marriage is
[1:55:11] 50/50 then when you put your head on the
[1:55:13] pillow at night you're going to wonder
[1:55:15] did I win did she win you know CU it's
[1:55:18] it's always competition right
[1:55:20] John yeah and and so the idea is 8020
[1:55:25] you give 80% just sacrifice but she's
[1:55:28] doing the same thing and then you meet
[1:55:30] everything's fine so you got to be
[1:55:33] honest with your with your mate and uh
[1:55:35] you know people are watching us all the
[1:55:37] time even over here on this island
[1:55:39] people are watching oh those Believers
[1:55:40] over there got a bargain on the Catholic
[1:55:42] Church they're watching you yeah they're
[1:55:45] watching and um to see how we cope and
[1:55:48] dark Le OFA and but the thing is what do
[1:55:51] they see in you see when brother Brandon
[1:55:53] was here there were people I knew him
[1:55:55] personally they basically worshiped him
[1:55:58] they baptized in his name they had
[1:56:01] candles you
[1:56:02] know it looked crazy I knew they were
[1:56:05] wrong I had enough Bible from the
[1:56:07] Baptist Church enough holy ghost that I
[1:56:09] knew they were wrong but we got the same
[1:56:12] thing today there's there's worshippers
[1:56:15] there's people that are not balanced you
[1:56:16] know and so uh instead of Downing them
[1:56:21] what has people seen in me have they
[1:56:23] seen an angel in me have they seen Jesus
[1:56:25] Christ
[1:56:26] today uh John 13:35 by this shall all
[1:56:31] people know that you're my followers how
[1:56:33] do those people out there know that
[1:56:34] you're followers of Jesus Christ because
[1:56:36] you dress better because your car is
[1:56:38] better no the love you have one to the
[1:56:40] other they're watching and that's the
[1:56:42] way they're going to know okay okay so
[1:56:46] um yeah we're very involved in
[1:56:48] missionary work in we're printing in
[1:56:49] Mexico printing in South America
[1:56:51] printing in China even in the US and
[1:56:55] providing you know humanitarian Aid to
[1:56:58] these people but see the the gospel has
[1:57:00] reached the highest level of the drug
[1:57:02] world now I know there's people right
[1:57:04] here in this island that would give
[1:57:06] anything for those drugs right you
[1:57:08] probably know some of them excuse me and
[1:57:12] that's the reason that those guys are in
[1:57:13] business because there's people up here
[1:57:15] demanding they got to have it
[1:57:18] so the um um we had we don't have now
[1:57:22] but we had a radio broadcast where there
[1:57:24] would be some songs and they put on a
[1:57:26] portion of brother R's tape and it was
[1:57:28] English Spanish English Spanish a lot of
[1:57:31] people
[1:57:32] benefited and so one of the uh people
[1:57:36] that heard the broadcast at one point
[1:57:38] was a man that you probably heard of his
[1:57:40] name is Cho I mean short he was top drug
[1:57:45] dealer drug mover millions and billions
[1:57:48] of dollars he heard the broadcast and
[1:57:51] then it kind of struck him and he told
[1:57:54] his people how get in contact with them
[1:57:55] see what this is all about and U so they
[1:57:59] sent him a a life story book you know I
[1:58:01] had the drawing on the front and he read
[1:58:04] it hey I like this said tell them we
[1:58:06] need 10,000 well we don't have 10,000 so
[1:58:08] we sent him a memory stick here you
[1:58:10] print it with your money because they
[1:58:12] got all kinds of money so they printed
[1:58:14] that he's got when he was still free
[1:58:17] we'll get to that a minute but when he
[1:58:18] was in business he had 10,000 people in
[1:58:21] his army
[1:58:23] with good guns so he spread those out to
[1:58:26] all them he printed Church A's books he
[1:58:28] printed all kinds of things for his
[1:58:30] people um eventually he says yep I
[1:58:33] believe the only difference is he hasn't
[1:58:36] been baptized now he went through a big
[1:58:39] trial which uh the US government played
[1:58:42] all kinds of money now they he locked up
[1:58:44] in a maximum security out in Colorado
[1:58:47] and maybe someday they'll call let us
[1:58:49] end to baptize him but all kinds of
[1:58:52] those people have heard and they
[1:58:56] believe
[1:58:57] so we're just trying to Shine the Light
[1:59:01] let them know there's a reality you
[1:59:03] we're not worshiping William Brandon
[1:59:04] we're worshiping Jesus Christ the Lamb
[1:59:07] of God but this is the restoration
[1:59:09] Prophet that brought us back to the
[1:59:11] truth okay so the same brother I told
[1:59:13] you about earlier had another dream one
[1:59:15] time and
[1:59:17] um he um he was he said he was in heaven
[1:59:21] he was there he can see some things and
[1:59:23] he's talking to brother brandom and I
[1:59:25] said no wait a minute he doesn't speak
[1:59:26] Spanish and you don't speak English yeah
[1:59:28] but we could understand each other okay
[1:59:30] so they're talking and um a whole bunch
[1:59:34] of details but um he said now now
[1:59:37] brother BR down there where I live
[1:59:38] there's a bunch of people say You must
[1:59:40] come back and do these things you got a
[1:59:41] big list of things you got to do when
[1:59:42] you come back he said look I have said
[1:59:45] everything I've had to say that part's
[1:59:47] finished but if I was to come back the
[1:59:50] way they h
[1:59:52] desire I would have to take a few people
[1:59:54] to the
[1:59:56] Woodshed and you know what that means I
[1:59:59] mean we're going to go out there I'm
[2:00:00] going to beat the fire out of you and
[2:00:01] when you finish crying you can come back
[2:00:03] in you know well so they're talking and
[2:00:07] then he uh he noticed this young girl
[2:00:10] standing there next to brother brm kind
[2:00:11] of hanging onto his arm he looked at her
[2:00:14] oh that's young Rebecca and so uh he
[2:00:17] looked at her and she gave it the big
[2:00:18] smile and she says you tell George I'm
[2:00:21] right where he told me to wait so it is
[2:00:24] going to happen and we want to stay
[2:00:27] balanced you know how we stay
[2:00:28] balanced read one page of your church
[2:00:31] age book every day you read one chapter
[2:00:33] out of your Bible you listen to the
[2:00:35] prophet for 30 minutes and you pray you
[2:00:39] do those four things starting today
[2:00:41] you'll be better balanced in your life
[2:00:44] the church all run smoother and brother
[2:00:46] John can preach more
[2:00:47] freely
[2:00:49] agreed may God bless you
[2:01:12] I liked how he started out he said we
[2:01:14] are not qualified to judge only
[2:01:17] qualified to witness so often we only
[2:01:19] have half the story maybe not even half
[2:01:21] the story you know but if we can say
[2:01:23] tell what we saw when we were walking in
[2:01:25] he was talking about you know how Philip
[2:01:27] went to Nathaniel And he said we found
[2:01:28] this guy and Nathaniel says well how am
[2:01:30] I going to you know why he said come and
[2:01:33] see come and see for
[2:01:35] yourself and if you're not convinced
[2:01:37] then you can walk away but you come and
[2:01:39] see and see if he doesn't mean the same
[2:01:41] thing to you that he means to the rest
[2:01:43] of us and then he said God has a way of
[2:01:45] doing things not obvious not our way not
[2:01:49] our time but God has a way of doing
[2:01:51] things let me tell you this if there's
[2:01:52] any young Baptist men out there looking
[2:01:54] at my daughter there's no way there is
[2:01:57] no
[2:01:58] way amen but when you're a prophet you
[2:02:01] can do certain things because you can
[2:02:03] see sometimes the end from the beginning
[2:02:06] we can't do that so I'm going to I'm
[2:02:09] going to correct brother George here
[2:02:10] just for a moment and say if young men
[2:02:13] from other churches from other
[2:02:15] denominations come in for your daughters
[2:02:17] Brothers do not give them to them amen
[2:02:20] but when a prophet sees what's coming
[2:02:22] down that road he can do it if he's got
[2:02:24] thus sayeth the Lord I don't have thus
[2:02:26] sayeth the Lord amen but I I thought
[2:02:28] that was an amazing thing because most
[2:02:30] of us would say no right rightfully so
[2:02:33] we would say no but that Prophet looking
[2:02:34] further down could see exactly what was
[2:02:37] coming and he had no problem with it
[2:02:39] amen I love how he said the reason for
[2:02:42] that Ministry success is the prayers of
[2:02:44] faithful
[2:02:46] people you know who John Ryan was right
[2:02:48] he was the the man who got healed of his
[2:02:50] blindness but he he went up for the
[2:02:53] prayer line and brother Bram says okay
[2:02:55] you're healed and the next day John Ryan
[2:02:58] came back and said I thought you said I
[2:02:59] was healed and brother Braham said I
[2:03:00] thought you said you believed and two
[2:03:03] weeks later he's in the barber's chair
[2:03:05] and they're giving him a hard time about
[2:03:06] it and his eyes come open because what
[2:03:08] happened is he went he testified for two
[2:03:11] weeks hear all about it hear all about
[2:03:13] it I'm Healed of my of my blindness
[2:03:15] these things and he testified without it
[2:03:17] yet being there and then while they're
[2:03:19] making fun of him in the barber shop his
[2:03:21] eyes came open and then he really had
[2:03:23] that you know and I didn't know that
[2:03:25] that was a that was a new thing for me
[2:03:27] that he followed along then and prayed
[2:03:28] for those meetings but how many times
[2:03:30] can we point to that and it was the
[2:03:32] prayer of a faithful mother of a
[2:03:33] faithful Saint that's back in the
[2:03:35] background and we don't know what it was
[2:03:37] brother Bron would talk about that that
[2:03:39] woman that that got on her knees and she
[2:03:40] got a burden to have meetings and she
[2:03:43] she you know brought in a minister and
[2:03:45] she hired a place and only one young man
[2:03:48] got saved but it was Dwight Moody I
[2:03:49] think was the one he said that woman's
[2:03:51] pray prayers a million souls to Christ
[2:03:54] through her prayer to bring the man in
[2:03:56] that would bring in those different ones
[2:03:58] amen but through it all he says the
[2:04:00] footsteps of a righteous man are ordered
[2:04:02] of the Lord and I love how he said the
[2:04:04] first witness is your changed life amen
[2:04:07] that people can look at the way we live
[2:04:08] the things we say the things we don't
[2:04:10] say the things we do the things we don't
[2:04:12] do and that is our witness before we
[2:04:14] ever open our mouth amen amen that was
[2:04:16] just wonderful let's all stand together
[2:04:18] if we would and I'll invite brother
[2:04:21] Bob's already here I think but we're
[2:04:22] going to sing that song he's got it all
[2:04:24] in control anden I thought that was just
[2:04:27] beautiful that through all those things
[2:04:29] you know it it struck me when he said
[2:04:31] you know brother brandham died and they
[2:04:33] just they were
[2:04:35] despondent much like when Christ
[2:04:37] left he died and what do we do now what
[2:04:40] do we do now but he said what did we
[2:04:43] start to do we started to pray we
[2:04:45] started to read our Bible we started to
[2:04:47] dwell on the word and all of a sudden we
[2:04:48] knew what to do we knew where to go and
[2:04:50] we got a burden and we started to do the
[2:04:53] work of the Lord and sometimes that's
[2:04:55] what's got to happen is the the great
[2:04:57] soldiers have to die so that great
[2:04:58] soldiers can rise up behind them and
[2:05:00] carry the battle and carry the word
[2:05:02] forward amen that's beautiful let's sing
[2:05:04] it he's got it all in controls we hand
[2:05:05] it over to brother Bob and he's got it
[2:05:09] all in
[2:05:15] control he's got it all in control
[2:05:23] for he put that
