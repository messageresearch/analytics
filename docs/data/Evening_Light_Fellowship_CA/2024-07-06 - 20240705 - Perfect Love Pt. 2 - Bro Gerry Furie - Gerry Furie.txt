spirit out amen is that your prayer this evening amen there's one initial baptism but there's many refilling days after the day of Pentecost they came in and they needed more and there was a mighty pouring on them again amen if they needed it in that day how much more do we need it if we're going in a resurrection and a Rapture amen amen God bless you want to invite or welcome each one that's here this evening we've had a couple more visitors come in and I'm not going to go Name by name because I'll inevitably forget one but we do have brother Paul and sister Rebecca LaFontaine here so we want to welcome them in it means that we've got our next set of our next preacher coming up at least so brother Jerry's done after this evening and he can relax and then brother Paul will pick up the the Baton and and carry us forward so we're so thankful they came in uneventfully brother Barry coffee is not here yet but he's supposed to be coming in tonight as well Lord willing he'll preach for us on Wednesday night so uh you get a real break for me for about a week and a half almost two weeks so I'm ready for a break and I'm ready to to listen to somebody else but uh God bless you each one just enter in amen the ice breaker I think is always the the first service and it's the toughest one it's behind us we know each other we know what's coming we know we can just sit back and feed on the word amen so you lift your cup up this evening we're going to sing that song fill my cup Lord I lift it up and you just hold it before God what you want what you have need of not what you want but what you have need of and say Lord touch it these dry and thirsty places these little spots that we know been hanging around a little too long and say Lord fill my cup fill my life let it overflow with that perfect love we heard about last night and let that take hold of the situation let that kick out the sickness let that kick out the things that have been tormenting us in our lives and make a real change that last as we read that scripture last night he who the sun sets free is free indeed that means it's a finished work when he does it amen let's believe for a finished work tonight in our lives amen let's sing this song as brother Jerry would come fill my cup Lord so fill my cup [Music] Lord I lift it up Lord so come and quit this thirsting of my soul breed of [Applause] Heaven feed me till th want oh here's my cup fing up and make me more so fill my [Music] cup I lifted up [Music] and my of [Music] Heaven to our [Music] amen God bless you Saints welcome once again amen I just want to thank brother Jonathan once again and sister Bianca uh make me feel welcome you know I mean when I started out last night like the Icebreaker like brother John said you know when you come in you start preaching to a group of people that you don't really know and and and sometimes it comes away like my wife said to me he says man that was a real Icebreaker it was you know I said it was going to be pastorial and it was real pastoral he say you don't preach like that outside your your pulpit and I just you know you want to be led by the Holy Spirit you want to have the mind of Christ you can sit there and Friends uh and you want you want to be able to get something to the heart of the people to have help them in their in their daily walk that's why you know I'm going to go on perfect love again here tonight but coming from a different angle because the understanding is that God wants a manifestation we can talk about the letters discuss about the letter we can talk about a debate about Doctrine it's not about having perfect Doctrine it's about having perfect love because brother bam tells us the only thing that's going to enter in is perfect love he said all your religious demonstrations all the things you do and all this and all it will not count in that day unless you have perfect love and that's what we're after is perfect love we want to be able to be able to submit ourselves and say Lord you take over you use me and then we then we're on our way amen we want to be on the right road map amen if you have your Bibles handy we're turn to uh you know Luke chapter 4 and we're going to read from verse 16 but you know the thing is uh you know we want to be able to express the perfect love of God and the only way you can actually Express it is knowing your place and knowing who you are and and I and I spoke about this a few times over the years and I know brother Johnson I'm going to just touch on a few things he's probably heard me somewhere else preach these things some of these things but I just want to understand is the pattern of the word is the brooding the speaking and the dividing and then the manifestation see the word is here to manifest the word is not just to stay in the Bible it's not just to stay in the message book it's here to manifest and where manifest in your lives we are the word made flesh in this day we the second coming of Jesus Christ right bridegroom bride amen so friends the understanding this is that when Jesus comes on the scene he walked out of the volume of the book just like we've walked out of the volume of the book he walked out of the volume of the book of the Old Testament we're walking out of the volume of the book of the New Testament amen and you cannot express perfect love unless you know who you are now cous he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and he stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had open the book now he's opening the book Because We believe We preach from an open book nothing hidden from us so he opens the book and now you got to understand this is that he opens the book and he found the place where it is written for him he wasn't quoting talking about Moses now he's talking to Pharisees here he's doing this in front of Pharisees he's gone to the church he's gone to the synagogue and he's preaching to Prophet quoting people that believe Moses said this Moses said this but that's not what he said he said the Spear of the Lord is upon didn't say Moses he didn't say brother bradam the spirit of the Lord is upon me now they're going to get mad at this cuz he's they're not they're not going to be talking about their Prophet now we all believe God's in a prophet I believe God's in a Prophet this day for us to get us ready for a Rapture so he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach oh I didn't I didn't probably switch it right he says preach the gospel of the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance of the captives the and recovering the sight to the Blind and set of Liberty them that were are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book now the book is O was open to him he hands it back and it's closed to the Pharisees that's right right he's the open book now he's the very life he's become comes the open book they can't take it they can't see it they're going to get mad at them right he said he closed the book gave it again to the ministers sat down and the eyes of all of them were in the synagogue were fastened on him now this is a traditional thing that was happening and he begin to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears we can say the same thing message people can't but the bride can they are message people that's right not seeing the word made flesh I mentioned it last night now we want to unfold ourselves in the manifestation in the manifestation of the word revealed in this day do we not amen let's have a word of prayer Father in Heaven Lord Jesus I'm just thankful God for your grace for your mercy for your love in our lives father there is no way I'll be able to see myself unless you point me to it Lord father as the Holy Ghost come in this day to lead us into all truth I pray father that the people will be able to see themselves in a greater light than they've ever seen before granted I pray I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seat amen now this wasn't unusual in that day because what they would would do you know in their as their custom was they would get up and they would pick out three men from the synagogue or three men that was at the synagogue that day and they would get up get them to come up and actually read the scripture and they'd have three priests get up and read the scripture also now they didn't have scripture like we have today as far as the Bible and stuff like this they would have Scrolls and they'd be passed around to different synagogues around Israel and the thing is it just so happened in that day that here they had the scroll of Isaiah so here Jesus gets up and he knows all the plan of God he knows he has an understanding that what's going on but they don't have an understand what's going on they they're looking at him as he gets up there and he begins to identify actually who he was and he stood there before the people and he said this day the scripture is fulfilled and they begin to say well man that's too much that's just too far you're going too far now and then remember friends the thing is it was his custom to go to the synagogue it wasn't like he was a stranger he grew up in that church if I can say it that way he grew up with those people he knew those people they knew who he was they knew about his their father and like they call him Joseph they Mar they knew about the family they knew all the Dynamics and everything but here Jesus gets up here and he begins to speak these things he begin to say unto them this day the script fulfilled in your ears that's why friends the thing is it's so important to understand as a bride of Jesus Christ that you're the word made flesh in this day and I know you probably heard this from over and over again for years and years and years but it's more important than it's ever has been before and the reason why that is is that all Redemption comes through the bride they cannot be made perfect without us right they cannot be made perfect without us and the fullness of the word came back in this day and what has it done what has it done it does not make us just a bunch of debaters and uh and understanding the letter and stuff like this and be able to debate these things but it's actually a fulfillment in the word of God see when Jes Jesus came 2,000 years ago it wasn't just to debate with the Pharisees and debate with with with the Sadducees of that day and show them how wrong they were but he was going to manifest something he was going to actually manifest the love of God see because that in those days the the at the synagogue it was a breeding ground for a lot of doctrinal issues and they actually go to the synagogue and they begin to debate amongst each other and fight amongst each other and this means that means that and here's Jesus stands up before them now it's one thing to read the scriptures but it's another thing when you read the scriptures and the scriptures are about you and the thing is that here was Jesus he comes amongst them and when he reads it it's not you know they would blaspheme him for what he said in some this but they would think that the letter was so holy and the scripture was so holy they wouldn't blaspheming in that but here they're blaspheming the very word that became before them and stood before them and said I am here I am I'm the one I'm the one that you've been waiting for but they didn't have that understanding and to today right now as the Bride of Jesus Christ comes before you and says I'm here I'm here right now that's identifying who you are see it's not just about debating the message never came just to debate the message never came just to be able to you know I know the third poll and I know this because remember was preaching on perfect love last night we didn't come for that because it it came for to manifest something that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world and I'm here can we say the same thing I'm here here see because it's amazing to me that as we go on in this there's more splits there's more people have you know you they'll identify with certain portions of the message they'll identify with certain doctors of the message they'll identify with certain things that but when it really comes down and do they know who they actually are see because to understand how important is the message to us see how important is it what has it has it done for us because the consummation doesn't come by the letter the consummation comes by the manifestation see the thing is Jesus couldn't say he was the word unless he manifest the word see you cannot become the word on say you're the word unless you manifest it so he walked out of the Old Testament just like the brides walking out of the new test here today and you're between the stage of the pers possession what are we waiting for now we're waiting for the body change brother bah tells us that she's waiting for the revelation of the Rapture so understand this because we look at because is actually the the opening of the word in this day or the breaking the seals in the day is actually revealing the mystery of your life because just just to go off Sidetrack here when Tamar when he when she she you know of course we know the story of Tamar when uh you know Judah you know uh took her in as a prostitute and she conce or she conceived his seat and the thing is that she he he she asked one thing from him give me your signat a couple things from him but one of the main things with the sign and there and then she was pregnant with this child they he didn't know it but the thing is that they were going to burn her they're going to kill her all etc etc it's according to the law the custom of that day and the thing is that when she came for the for it to happen what was it she broke the seal and broke the mystery of her very life of who she actually was that she was the wife of Jude see that's what the seven seal did for our lives it was the breaking of the seal in our life and what it showed us that the the wife of Jesus Christ we're not just some denomination we're not just some message people quoting quotes and believe in a prophet that's been off the scene since 1965 we're the very manifestation of the word of this day so understand this is that Paul when he came on the scene and he began to speak to the Hebrew church and he began to talk to them and one of the things he said I'm going to look look at it because now he's talking to message people here and he and he goes on to Hebrews 3:13 I'm going I'm going to go real fast here later good foundation here he said but exhort one another while call today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitful of sins he's talking to message people Hebrews and now watch what he says here he's because the reason why he's talking to them they're not progressing in the word they believe the message they believe what Jesus did for them but they're not progressing the word he said for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast onto the end so in other words friends like I said last night see about this perfect love that we' been talking about is the thing is that when brother bam talks about it's like a vast ocean love of God and it and it and it comes down to a river comes down to a creek comes down to a cap even a bottle cap brother Bram says and think is that's the love of God now they got maybe a bottle cup but they had need and Paul is trying to get them up to an adult love not a teenager love not not a baby love but an actual mature love a love that say a husband and wife maybe been married for 40 years or 38 years how long we've been married dear 38 years okay I'm on on I'm on ball here I'm I'm in our good books now but understand this is that I love her more than I've ever loved her before when I first married I love her more now than I ever have what is it it grew it became mature that's the same thing with Christ see the thing is that we are made partakers of Christ he said if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end remember when I was talking about OE of little faith they didn't have confidence they didn't have trust in his word so Paul goes on and he says while it is said he said today if we hear will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation so in other words don't be like the Jews that came out of Egypt he said for some when they were heard did provoke how be it not all came out of the Egypt by Moses now they would have believed Moses was the messenger just like we believe brother Brown was our messenger actually I believe Christ is our Messenger right so watch this he said for some when they had heard had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of the Egypt by Egypt by Moses but with whom see was he grieved 40 years what what was it not with them that had sinned whose carcass fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not so they could not enter in because they believed not right they had the promise God gave them the promise told them told them what they what they had but he says in verse 193 so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief they had little little faith little trust God says it's yours go fight for it but watching verse chapter 4 verse one let us therefore fear now why are they fearing remember I was talking last day why was it why do people fear brother we can't move on because we have fear brother B one place he put puts it this way he says it's like a boat stuck in the harbor has a 440 Motors and could just rip around rip around but never go anywhere they never go anywhere because why they're too scared fear gripped the church amen he said lest a promise be left us of entering into his rest any of you should see him come short of it amen so he they got the message but the thing is they didn't move on they didn't progress with the message they talked about the message they debate the message they talked about the third pole they talked about the churches they talked about the different doctrines but they didn't move on with for onto US was the Gospel preach as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them I'm preaching to you tonight the question is is a prophit in you it's important see because not being mixed with faith in them that HT it see we can preach and talk about it I could talk about many things but friends there's an unfulfilled part here we can talk about the masses and all the great stories and all I'm nothing against any of that but friends we never talk or preach about the unfulfilled part what's the unfulfilled part my body change and what I'm saying that is that the thing is is that people they can speak about things but they're no farther down the road is because the thing they they they could talk about the fulfilled every denomination talks about Calvary they talk about the fulfilled part nothing wrong with the calvary I'm not saying that that's where it starts but the thing is that what they do they stop they stop progressing they stop moving on see because what it is that the spirit of leosia gets a hold of you and say well I got the message I mean I I believe the messenger I believe just like you Brother jury absolutely I'm not we're not saying that but what it is that people become satisfied with a fulfilled part and they never move on they never move on they get satisfied with that and the thing is you know when we look at ourselves because our Focus many times is just on the fulfilled part amen so thing is that we w we want to focus somewhat on the unfilled part here on the unfill unfulfilled part because the thing is there's going to be a people that are going to fulfill the unfulfilled part amen amen see remember friend when Israel became satisfied the fulfilled part they started fighting for their full inheritance they're in the land for 28 years and the thing is they failed to make progress and here was the Hebrew Church they were basking in what was already done oh man I'm a m believer oh that's so good I love coming to church we can be all church members here and we just ask what we know but the thing is we're in the age of the Harvest we're the age of the of the maturing of the grain see we're in the age of the climax of The maturity of the church this is our moment this is a predestin moment for me this is a predestinate moment for you see what it is Friends the thing is it's a time for the Holy Spirit to speak from our heart and become fulfilled what's already has not been fulfilled become that fulfillment see because Christ is here where the bride where the church where the bedding ground right thing is the SE comes forth you're to give birth right so Christ the male is here and you're the female he wants to seow seed right that's why friends the thing is we're looking to express the attribute now I want to just look at an example here and got this you know uh about you know when I I was going through a series on this back home but the thing is is that there was a woman here and I'll just show show it here got it out of the doctor's journals and from from actually from the states here I said the patient was married at 20 and wanted to start a family right away but after 3 years of trying without conception and she went to a doctor now relate this to the church he said it was known by medical SS an injury or an infection could cause the Fallopian tubes to close he said this Dr dunar Who described this case said it was known that the emotional crisis or shock can close these tubes just as it may make one clench one's fist he stated he found he found his patient tubes closed during ovulation and when the Ovation was over he found on the patient tubes open again it was believed in conclusion that Dr Dunbar believed the muscle contracted involuntarily at the illusion the closing the tubes was a woman's deep fear of pain associated with childbirth in her mind so she's wanting a baby and they're trying and trying but the problem was was in her mind and the thing is nothing wrong with her not nothing physically wrong with her but her fear in her mind of childbirth stopped the seed from coming into her amen so it caused her tubes to to close up so the subconscious remember brother BR talked about the subconscious and the conscious he said if you get the conscious and the subconscious and the Holy Ghost lined up he said something will happen amen he said you got to get him line up but he says what the problem is the subcon saying you really don't believe oh I believe no subconscious no you don't really believe you say you believe your conscious says it because you're yapping away and you're conscious saying this saying that and you're saying I believe I believe I believe but you're subconscious no you don't really believe and brother man says nothing can happen and there's a lot of things in the message brother talks about this and the subconsciousness says you really trally don't believe if I said to you you believe oh I believe I believe but your subconscious said no it's not because your subconscious like a supercomputer it's taking in all all this information over the years it will never happen it's like brother Jonathan saiding at the end of the service last night it won't happen so you don't believe it's going to happen so it never happens but hear this woman here he said these fears and images were placed in her when she was a child we see the woman's reproductive system reacting to the fears on the mind no friends the thing is it wasn't visible from the outside I can see you you dress nice nice congregation but things aren't visible on the outside to us everything is healthy everything is all right I'm a message believer I come to the church but all of a sudden friends the thing is the reason why we cannot reproduce Christ like God wants us to is because we have fear where we don't have the trust we don't have the confidence just like the children of Israel going in the promised land they say they believe they believe Moses believe we have the promise we have all this but they did not allow thems to go in and and many times we don't allow ourselves because we close off our fupi tubes spiritually speaking and we don't allow the seed to penetrate into us to Manifest this word see what it is for as we come to church we hear the word we hear the word we hear the word but we're scared see the thing is that God wants to repair us but we really don't don't let them because we close up and it's not that you're not believing but you close up oh ye of little faith right that's what Jesus said to the said to the disciples oh he of little faith why because they're closing up their flooping tubes don't sow that seed into me he brother R says don't be scared he says that's the reason you can't receive is because you're afraid it won't happen just as in your mind it already happened you're too scared to receive it now we all been around this message for years right most of us and what are the things that we're actually scared of in this message now there's always a human human element to us so we're scared of certain things now when I start preaching on the seventh seal people test up right away what's he going to say what's he going to say about the seven seal but you understand it's the seven seal it's not the first six that causes a confusion it's always the seven seal that causes a confusion and what the devil's done to us is brought it down to a debate and when you bring it down to a a debate it becomes non-effective and God wants this word to be effective in our life see this is why friends the thing is the seven seal is more than just an event is actually the mystery of your life that's what it came to do to actually unveil the mystery of your life so you stand there with the deed in your mind I got the message I got the M I got I got you know I got and the thing is that without revelation of what is supposed to be for you and no understanding of it you'll never manifest it see that's why friends the thing is is that it you know the seven seal is actually a perfect mute and when it's a mute it doesn't mean things aren't happening behind the scenes see the the seven seal is a perfect mute but you had to wait until it was time to say it the mute button was taken off and your mystery of your life becomes open hallelu of who you actually are and now you have access full access to this perfect love amen now watch what brother Brown says he says when the seven seal mystery in the book of redemption was broken open he said think of it but it's [Applause] broke I feel sorry for people that don't believe it's open because how do you know the Myster of your life is not open amen the lamb bricks you know what they were AED by it I believe they didn't know there it was they just stopped why what was it see friends the thing is there's people that believe and still believe that brother Bram didn't complete and open up the seventh seal now let me just say it this way remember the seven seal is a mute seals were preached God chose to turn off the mute button and brother Bram saw the third part of the seven seal he says there's great three great things he says there's three great things that goes with it one unfolded today or yesterday the other would unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's an unknown language but the time is close now let's just take a look at some of this let's look at what the seven seal actually is because people get scared I know you frighten right now when I'm preaching on this I can just feel the atmosphere I don't have to be a prophet to discern this because really what the seven seal is is always you think it's a way out there but it's you I'll show you what brother Bram said he said we must remember that this seven seal is the end of time of all things now the breaking of the seventh seal the finish of the seventh seal are two different things the breaking of the seventh seal and the finishing of the seven seal is two separate things land breaking the seals get the book of the symbol form lamb takes the book to claim his bride this is why people will say there's no more Redemption because they sto there they put a period there and they stop there and what they're doing they're taking two events and making one out of it it's what they're doing that's why you know there's people and I you probably known people bum people that he's off The Mercy Seat all those different things you've heard that I don't believe he's off The Mercy Seat I don't believe he's off The Mercy Seat when he gets off The Mercy Seat he's come to take the bride home right so he says the seventh seal is the end of all things he said the thing the things written in the seven seven seal book sealed up the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends but we're not there yet right now watch Stay With Me the seven seal the opening of it can happen and it happened in 1963 but the ending of it goes right up to the end of the Millennium okay so it is end and it is the end of the struggling world he says is the end of the struggling nature that hasn't happen yet it's the end of everything if there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the seals it's the end of the set Earth it's even the End of Time Time runs out so the ending of the seven seal is the ending of time and then we go over to the eighth everybody with me right now watch what he says here he said noce is the end of the church age he says it's the end of the Seven Seals he says it's the end of the trumpet the end of the vials and even ends the ushering in on the millenni that's on the seventh seal so the seventh seal lasts over a span of years now there's many things in this now the seven seal reveals the person of Jesus Christ himself and the Advent it also reveals the ending of time ending of the strling nature the aring of the son of David and in the Millennium all under the seven seal okay everybody still with me now watch it's like the rocket into the air and the rocket explodes here and it goes up then explodes again and puts out five stars so the seven seal comes in stages okay stages or Revelation it just keeps going on and one of those stars explode and blows out five stars from it so it's happening it didn't just stop in 1963 it keeps happening it keeps exploding and he said and then one of he said one of those Stars explodes blows over five stars from it and then one of them Stars explodes blows out five stars from it so what's happening then it's not just it with the initial explosion five stars came it just keeps on exploding keeps on exploding it's exploding here tonight okay it just doesn't stop see friends the thing is the seven seal has been timed over the years it's been timed over years revelation after revelation after Revelation it keeps on veiling itself under the initial explosion of the word now people say the Seven Seals open but they'll watch the initial rocket and they stop they never go on Amen no stay with me cuz I want want you to see what what I'm seeing here so people they'll stop there but they'll never go on to the next Revelation they never grow up they never mature in perfect love they still in a baby form and theyve stopped progressing on the revelation of it and people have turned their back and and it's still unveiling still coming forth so he says it's like a fire a rocket into the air and The Rock explodes here and it goes up and then explodes again it puts out five stars and out of those Stars explos blows out of five stars from it so it's each explosion it gets smaller and smaller and small what's happening right now God's honing his bride honing her down thinning her out now watch he said that's what the seven seal see just keep keeps on going it just ends at the time for the world it ends at the time for this it means the time for that it ends the time for this it ends the time everything just ended up in the seventh seal now it was so great the seventh seal in the heavens that he couldn't say anything about it I must have skipped something here I must have cut something out anyways we'll go on so this what the seven seal it just ends are time world it ends a time for this it means a time for that it's the end of time it's the end of time everything just ended up on the seventh seal and there's another quote here I must have missed that quote and he said what the what it is he says it brings it the seven seal brings him back to Earth again but the thing is what we miss in that same quote he says it's Revelations 10 is the seventh seal Mighty angel brother brandom and you it's the unveiling of the mystery of your life now catch this the seven seal is you the manifestation of Jesus Christ now we're all scared remember remember when I just brought this out we get scared this is exactly what brother we get scared to move on we we get scared to progress we get scared to move where God wants us to move to and we and all of a oh he's going to get us off false start no friends it's easy it's that you look at yourself and brother bam tells us that the seventh seal is Revelations 10 I'm in that take the book eat the book prophesy again you know that's what I'm doing I'm prophesying my people get scared oh I don't know brother Jerry I really don't know what is it friends you're still in baby form you're in teenage form grow up in adult life where you have perfect love cast us out all [Music] fear amen we need to get the fear out of our Lives get the fear out of our life now friends the thing is my predestinate seed in me is crying out for a glorified body it's crying out I want more I want more what what is it it's crying out I need to get out of here amen see the problem is is the identity crisis people have an identity crisis in the M oh I believe the m i well the children of Israel that came out they believe Moses was a prophet too they believed everything he was saying but why didn't they conquer why didn't they promise they got scared can you imagine Caleb being scared to go into the promised land can you imagine friends the thing is fear you know perfect love cast out all fear but kale says it's mine I don't care what anybody else says it's promised me it's mine but here was the children of Israel Led Out by a Vindicated Prophet but they were too scared to get their promise now watch this Exodus 311 and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go under pharaoh and that should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he says certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee and that I have sent thee when thou Hast brought forth the people out of Egypt you have served God upon this mountain and Moses said and oh man you know what I mixed up here I'll go on the first I just won't read the whole thing he he he says he says in verse 13 and Moses said unto unto God behold I am unto the children of Israel and I shall say unto them the god of the father has sent me unto you and you shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am right and he said thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel I am that H has sent me so friends the thing is that we look at those scriptures and we put them back in history put them back there but who are you I am that I am the Living God living in you manifesting identifying yourself in the word see when Peter came on the scene where did he identify himself when after after act after the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost where did he identify himself in Joel 2:28 he didn't identify at Calvary but he identified himself in the word see because remember friends brother bam tells us that Christ Mission got reveal the Thunders are in the types read Ruth read Esther read Rahab read Tamar all those ones see it was identification of what we have but people have an identity crisis in the message who am I you are him perfect love is you because God is love he dwelleth in love and if God dwells in me I dwell in love that's why friends the thing is here here Jesus identified himself in Luke 4 brother benam identified himself in in in MA in Malachi 4 so understand this is that we got to understand about ourselves what we're actually commissioned to do so God gave Moses a commission he got Moses's attention see it overwhelmed Moses we know that the I am is a present word so and the only word can ever be affected to us is the I am word can't be a history can't be future we can talk about we can debate oh there's going to be there going to be and I believe that too we can talk about Calvary we can talk about all things around the through the church ages but only way that the word could be effective in life now is I here the I am present word so God is dealing with a group of people here that are slaves they know the spiritual uh blessings they've got blessed in Goan they've been blessed they got the plagues they see this that everything they're just worshiping God but they still have a slave mentality they come out they seen the first two signs but the first two signs never never delivered them amen see friends of thing it doesn't because what the Satan does he begins to explain away the value of the word but watch here watch what brother Bron says he said Jesus to he said Jesus told us how to do it he overcome mean overcome means to stand their test that's right like an old Saints did like Jesus did in the midst of all his enemies and stood the test everything he tested against stood it in the very face of sickness and him being the Messiah he healed them in the face of death he said he brought it back to life in the face of galary his own death he defeated by surrendering himself why by the word by by the word said by the word said you destroy this Temple I'll raise it up in three days and the word say so see the pre in the presence of death he defeated he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell because why the word was real to him was the word to us we're trying to get to something here right so Moses was commissioned but here Moses begins to reason with God see friends the thing is anything you get from God Satan is going to fight you he's going to fight you with it because the thing is he doesn't want you to get the promise so Moses goes down to Egypt to get the children of Israel and the thing is that they're slaves for 400 years and they come out with that mentality of being a slave they had no real faith of their own and it's the same thing when brother Bram was here people their faith grew as he discerned but they never had no faith of their own they never could identify themselves with the word because they still had fear but here God was going to bring them out of of Egypt and he was going to take him to mountain and the thing is they constantly leaned on Moses or have the slave mentality they were constantly complaining their faith is always in the prophet they have no identity themselves they have an identity crisis and God said I'm going to bring you to a mountain and in the mountain I'm going to give them the true message they already seen the first two polls that didn't give them their identity we can have signs we up wonders I'm not against any of this Miracles all those different things but those things won't deliver you those things won't identify you we can speak in tongues I'm not against any of those things we can have all those gifts we can have everything but if you cannot see yourself in the word and identify yourself in the word it don't do you no good you're still an identity crisis so here is the age friends that we're living in we're living in Satan's Eden but guess what he's got us afraid of certain things in the message like I said got us afraid of the Seven Seals and he takes away the effectiveness of the message of the hour so remember be he says remember before the true message come forth Moses preached and led them out of an Egypt so what was the true message they already seen the first two polls that wasn't the true message so what he preached Egypt was just was just for to lead them out but it wasn't the true man it didn't give them an identification they still had all kinds of fear they were fearful they they were slave they had they had a slave mentality brother Ram goes on and says this he said before the true message come forth Moses preached LED them out of Egypt and there before the real Commandments was laid down the seals are brought in God come down before the people and prove that Moses was sent from him now brother Ram types The Ten Commandments to the Seven Seals and the thing is the friends the thing is he's trying to show the people and here was God trying to show the people that you got to open up your spiritual Fallopian tubes to receive the seed oh you'll never manifest it so brother man goes on he say what is taking place on the mountain is a true message coming forth to the people we always thought the true message was all three polls the first two was just to get people's attention but only this friends the thing is that we are called to go and receive the true message now Moses goes up in the mountain there's Thunders there's Lightnings and everything like that there things going on and friends is the thing is Moses is not even commissioned to take the people over in the promised land he's only commissioned to give them identity okay see he was commissioned to go up the mountain but he commissioned to only give them identity so Moses started on his journey they understood who Moses was they had an understanding they had a revelation was a prophet of God but brother goes on that ought to give you comfort see if it was God that started the journey then is God going to be God that's finishing the journey so it's not going to be confusing to the believer it's not going to be confusion because there's so much confusion and it's confusion is not around the first 2 third fourth fifth six six seal it's not confusion around there the confusion is around the seven seal and people get scared they get fearful when you started talking about because they don't understand the Revival the Revival is a Revival of understanding we can have all signs and wonders we can have all things going on all and friends the thing is you can have a church Revival but the bride's Revival is understanding of who you are identifying yourself as you and Christ Alone he said he say it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that's for ordained of God to be in the rouer it's not for everybody it's only for the elect they'll catch it see the only ones that will catch it are the ones that receive what God has done in this day of the Holy Ghost he said that is that is if he's a true Eagle he said he will understand the message of the are if he's a true Eagle now you see when Moses went up to get the true message what was he bringing down he was bringing down Israel's identity he was actually making them a citizen of the kingdom of God you realize when brother Bon went up because there only one man called to go up to the mountain came back down and what was he doing he was giving you your citizenship he was actually giving you your passport for heaven amen he was actually giving you that he was actually he what was he was identifying who you were see it was like you know brother M tells these stories about the eagle in the in the chicken barard it was a it was an identity crisis for that eagle until he heard mother Eagle come over and fly over and begin to squawk out oh and he begin to look at that I'm identified with that I'm identified with that because he was in an identity crisis he was going around trying to be like other chickens plucking away and eating this food eating he probably hated it cuz he was an eagle he wanted meat but when he looked up he looked up he said man I I I that that's me I I know I I feel it that's my identity that's the same thing with a message believer because what it is is that it gives you an identity with the breaking of the seal in your life seven seal mystery of your life life now friends the thing is we live so far bey bey below our privileges now brother bam you know he has a tent vision and remember the Ten Commandments are the type of the seals he has a tent Vision in 1956 in 1963 he says I didn't realize that I fit right in this because people are scared of the tent Vision they're scared of the tent Vision that's another thing they get scared of but we're building a pattern according to the word of God so we're looking to actually construct something that God has go given and according to the pattern of the word so the breaking of the SE seven seal brings him to Earth and God is God constructed so the seven seal for us what it is is the mystery or the breaking of the seal in your life showing you who you are because rapturing faith is not exterior it's interior you are the rapture Rapture you are that identity you're the one that's going in the Rapture it's going to be a great event but right now friends the thing is is that it's something that's actually happening in your life right now it's like Enoch it he walked with it for 365 years brother B says he kissed his kids uh bye kissed his wife goodbye went out the door and then God took him and friends the thing it was time to go it was time for the Rapture so understand this is that we we we have fellowship with him God's given us a place in his uh Kingdom he given us identity he's given the seven seal it's broken on your life it shows you who you are but listen to me friends when those when those Jews came out of Egypt and they had that state mentality and remember friends Aaron was there in the valley and he begin to make a golden calf gold is deity take all kinds of quotes together put it back where does it take you if you man made quotes takes you right back to Egypt amen takes right back to the world but I understand this friends here was a man that was called of God on the mountain Aaron will be your high priest so God didn't wait for Aaron to get right before he called him God doesn't wait for you to get right before he calls you that's the mercy and grace of God see because the thing is that when he when when we talk about you know Revelations 5 it shows the worshipper because he has made his priests and Kings under God now amen now not in the future right now that's why the real true worshiper comes from the hearts of the people and the thing is is brought by a revelation and the people say I believe this message I believe this place and they manifest it because it's something that's identified in their life it's something that's in them that's why the prophet of God when he looked at this he sees what happening he's seen you before you seen yourself he's seen there's going to be a bride he's seen that you're going to be walking this walk he seen that you're going to be understanding of the revealing word he's going to understand what it's all talk what it's all about because we look through the scriptures we look through we look what what what's wrote about this person what's wrote about that person but now I'm identifying what's wrote about me and who I am so brother B say a question and answer he say now we find out that the corruption see that hits the seventh Church age but the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything that what's what's happened to it he said because the end of the church AG has come to a prophetic gift to reveal these things are you following it because there's so much error around this stuff right so we preach from an open book do we not now watch this is the quote I'm I was looking for he said look I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this so he's saying close put an ear to it look at he said how striking from the seven angels angels messenger of the seven seal message in Revelations 10 was the seventh seal that's what he says I didn't say that that's his words so are you in the revelations 10 are you identified there we can it's easy to identify brother Braham it's easy to identify the mighty Angel but you're also identified with it he said there is a prophet to appear before the Gentiles to call the people back to the original Pentecostal doctor see it took the opening of The Seven seal the unveiling of you to show you who you actually are now the problem is that people don't dig far enough and they don't recognize their day in their message they read the books they listen to tastes I'm I'm I'm I'm showing you your citizenship showing you your identity C because Aaron said I he he said I am that I am because remember Moses told him just do what I say to do Aaron didn't catch it at first see the thing is we didn't catch things at first I'm just being honest I've been serving the lord for 40 years now I didn't catch it at first but as I walk in this walk and keep walking and walk it keeps opening up for me that's the grace of God to me that's him showing me and you got to be the same way it's got to be to a place where God is opening up for you it's him that's doing because we know who Jesus is we know who brother Brandon was we know the prophet we know those things but as he identifies you and shows you who you are I love him more I'm serving him greater than I've ever served him why because he's identified me as his own that's why the Revelation makes go the center of my of God's thoughts that I understand that it's not a bunch you know me knowing things it's me understanding things about myself that actually protrudes from me you remember friends Mary said according to your word right she identified herself I'm the one I'm the one sitting in sitting in the synagogue and the priest read that a virgin shall conceive all a sudden something HS to her she identified herself there was an identity in the word for her just like us there identity in the word because we have actually accepted what God has actually done for us so he says this now the little Eagle probably he said the oh he oh sorry I skipped something here that's what I did but he that understandeth he that knoweth this his place in this hour now I don't know what time I got up here you guys s a little bit of time for me now now the bridegroom the bride is living in the end time right you realize you're identified in this Bible the Bible bridegroom in the bride living in the end time Bible okay right God thought a lot of you and I always say it's like the tadpole a tadpole swimming around it just eats eats eats and all of a sudden the leg pops out leg pops out the legs on the back and they go from one dimension the water onto the land you just keep on feeding feeding feeding all of a sudden one day you're going to be in a glorified body from one dimension to the next Dimension but understand that Christ is the mystery of God revealed who's the Christ we are now without explaining I'm going to say something here and it takes maybe if you don't understand it right now hopefully the Lord willing you will understand because your Bible says that that God made Jesus both Lord and Christ right got that Christ is the anal word Lord Jesus God made you both Lord and Christ Lord of lords he's the Lord Lord You're the anointed word so if I said Lord Jonathan Christ no friend like I'm telling you you need to know who you are you understand many saviors plural come out of Mount Zion right Zion's always the bride that's what your Bible says right so friends we're in the Harvest moment we're in the Harvest time do you realize every promise of God is built on adverse conditions so you're going to try to get this promise but it's going to be built on adverse conditions you'll never be trouble-free you'll always have trouble Tri you always have tribulation in your life you go through things but guess what the seed in me is thanking him for taking me out of my sin amen see I'm want to be saved from myself I want to be saved from this flesh so you're created to actually worship God now remember friends I'm going to I'm going to go into something here right away I'm only be a few minutes the beginning something said some preacher said here I'm at the beginning of winding down the beginning of it but it's winding down was another half hour I'm not going to place another half hour don't worry now the Book of Esther they always wondered about the Book of Esther they wondered why it was put in the way it was but the Book of Esther was in between Nehemiah and it was in job remember Nehemiah brought the word back to jerus job was on the as sheep he the trials the tribulation and here Esther comes in between between so Neah Israel coming back to restore job represented the resurrection so Esther takes her place now brother bam says there's it's clo a church spirit and a bride Spirit are very close so we don't want to take on our church Spirit we want to take on the bride spirit it's nice to come to church and you feel the presence of God and feel the worship and all those different things but friends I want to go farther with this I want to go farther with just being having a church Spirit where we come to church and we wor and it's great it's wonderful get around Believers we should do those things but I want to go farther than that so in Psalms 271 it says a Psalm of David the Lord is my slight and we know this is the r the Rapture uh Rapture scriptures G uh brother bam uses he say the psalm of David the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear Whom Shall I Fear remember friends perfect love cast out all fear Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid now remember friends there's going to be a people that are actually going to move into these scriptures just like Jesus moved into Isaiah 53 there's going to be a people that are actually going to move into the scriptures and they'll be RT raptured so brother bam didn't use 2 uh Corinthians CH 4:1 16 he didn't use 1 Corinthians 15 he uses Psalm and he's showing the background of the Rapture that's and the thing is what is the background it's something to give you would outlay something that's behind it so the psalm was chosen for the background of the Rapture and so there will be a people there will be a people that will actually walk into this word I'm one of them I'm identified with this I believe friends there's a people that are come into a place they don't fear they allow the word to have prance in their life they won't fear man they won't fear the devil they won't fear trials I believe there's people they don't fear anything but they only fear God they give God reverence because in verse two it says and when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell that's a promise for us that's what it's shown who we are amen now watch I said all these things just to say this for God ha not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind now he didn't he didn't say holy ghost in this he said power and love and of the sound mind so we're living in a time where people are absolutely insane in their mind they call good evil and evil good amen we all agree with that we all see that see that because the they don't seeing mind is totally unstable and I don't want that mind but theen spirit is here trying to grab hold of your mind trying to make you crazy but here I want to remind you this the book of second Timothy was the last book that Paul actually wrote before they cut his head off he's sitting in prison the prison was called maritine prison it was a prison in Rome at the time and that prison was like a hole in the ground there's no light there's nothing nothing spectacular it's not like our Resort prisons in Canada but a hole in the ground and they pour food down there and there's a stream running through the prison to take away the waste and here's Paul writing this down and he's in this condition power love sound mind huh see what it is Friends the stench didn't bother him the stink didn't bother him in that sense fleshly it might might have done but he said God has given has not given us the spirit of fear now I don't want the spirit of fear but the reason why we don't progress like brother B say because we have fear and we got to get rid of that fear we got to push that fear out and allow perfect love to come in see because the thing is is that this when he was writing this he didn't write it in some pastor's office in a comfort he wrote it in prison a place of Filth a place of human waste see it was a dungeon and here he is pening this down and Paul knew what what was going to happen to him because he's a Roman citizen they couldn't crucify him as a Roman citizen they the only thing they could do was behead him and they did behead him so he knew what was going to happen so the thing is he knew these things and he was this was written about a month before his death Now understand this he's talking to us and telling us God has given us power he's given us love and he's giv us a sound mind and when Timothy re received these letters and begin to tell the church to and he's telling these things and and Timothy's looking at this he said God's given us the spirit of has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of some mind and here's Paul I'm not nervous I'm not scared not tore up my soul's ready my thoughts are sound that's where he was we lose a job or we do something happens to us just little things throws us right off but here's a man sitting in a prison and he's writing these things down and thing you know and the stink and and the stench of the prison system of that day would have been overwhelming but here he is I'm ready I'm not worried now to get to this place now let me just say it this way you know in the Old Testament when the law came down from Mount SAR uh uh Sena he said the dispensational anointing was come with a fear the law came with a fear it frightened the people do Thou shalt Thou shalt Thou shalt Thou shalt I said I said Mount Si I should say thou shalt Thou shalt Thou shalt it frightened the people but it did not reproduce no life it just sets the fear in the people I don't want to preach a gospel of fear I don't want to preach the gospel of of of you better not do this you better not do this but I want to understand the distance ation that God has actually given us the Covenant that he gave us he never gave us the Covenant of fear I want you to understand this see people say you're going to preach you preach this loose and we you live if you that your desire do it that's not my desire I'm born again I don't have a desire to drink I don't have a desire to go to danc I don't have a desire to do any of this see what has been given to us as a dispensation of Love he'll love you into not sinning he'll love you into living rights he don't scare me he gives me love where I don't want to do those things wrong he wants me to be though he wants to love me into it but Paul's saying here he said I has given us he has not given us a spirit of fear but a power and love in a sound mind power dunamis Dynamite so amazing to me is a god with couple dynamite and love together a power in you now I'm talking about identity crisis can you identify yourself in order to have perfect love you got to be identify yourself see because God hasn't given us something that gives us fear fear fear will tell you you're going to miss the match miss the Rapture I'm not going to miss the Rapture you're not brother here no I'm not going to let fear grab a hold me fear I put a sign up no trespassing to fear amen I won't allow it in see friends the thing is I'm not going to come to a place where I'm going to let the devil have his way in my life I'm not going to fear now we live in a good country here right now every one of us are going to go home tonight and if we're hungry we can go in the fridge pull out some food and eat right just like that imagine though if you didn't have that imagine if your bills are can't get paid because you have no job imagine how would you you feel would you have the same thing as Paul has sitting in prison the love the power and a sound mind thanking God that what he's given you in this day and age you thank God for all his blessings but the thing is that we're going to be an overcomer in this age see because what it is friends when life gets too easy for us we begin to backslide we come into a backing condition for God is giving us a spirit of fear but a not giving us spirit of fear but a power love and sound mind that word sound mind is an admonishing or calling soundness a mind to moderation and self-control self-control so I have to discipline my mind I have to discipline this devil get out of here devil get away from me devil get get out of here it's not somebody saying don't do this don't do that but my mind is going to correlate with the spirit of God it's not dos and don'ts friends I'm just telling you it's not dos and don'ts it's not a legalist message it's a love message I know we should raise our kids properly I'm don't get me wrong my wife knows me what I preach all the time don't get me wrong but understand this if it's not the love of God we miss the message we've actually missed it if we see that's what the Pharisees missed when Jesus came they missed the love they could do all the dos and don'ts but they missed the love message and that's what I'm trying to tell you see you're you're going to correlate your mind's going to correlate with the spirit of God now watch I'm going to I'm closing down don't worry closing down I'm really closing down I'm not going to lie to you for as many as led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the the spirit of bondage again to fear so that word Spirit AB bondage is a slave now remember friends many people go by a slave mentality when they serve God you realize scared Christians don't be aren't good Christians and now friends if you have the love of God in your heart you'll do what God wants you to do you'll dress right act right say things right you won't have uh corruption l language you'll have language that is pleasing to God for you've not received the spirit of bondage so a slave is under constant fear see remember friends when they were slave when Paul wrote this they could get beat they could get sold they could be separated beat down starve him all those different things and friends the thing is they can do all these Ty of things and many Christians serve god with a slave fear but I'm free I'm free from my bondage so you're free to do what he what he wants me to do see sin friends people say well I'm going to take you know oh I going to run around friends it's not about running around I'm made free from sin that's why the people they pull away from the message because they say they're free they say they're free what are they free from there's only one place to go is back to Sodom and just a bunch of perversion out there people that you know you know saying I'm run away from the mess running away from and turning their back of the M brother a false prop where are they running from they're running right back into Sodom bunch of perversion bunch of rotten type of thinking going on but I'm talking about a love relationship because I'm under jesus' atonement what Jesus did for me he loves me he takes care of me I'm his property he owns me amen see understand this I'm free I'm free from all this things of the world I'm only waiting for my body I want my body changed I glorified my seat in me is crying out for a glorified body for you have not received the spirit of barnish again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption you know friends serving God is a greatest thing you can ever do come to church and be able to hear the word of God man there's nothing like it you know the the you know I'm not against anything people do things in the world that's fine they you know I'm talking I I understand people at different age you can't put a 62y old head on a 18year old body I understand brother BR says those things I understand kids they're full of energy and active and stuff like that I understand all that but I want to say is that my mind is getting closer and focusing on the right things it's not focus focusing on the things of the world because the world has a lot of things going on I don't want to get into too much here but understand this whereby we cry Abba Father that word ABA actually means father what was God trying to get across to us that you are mine you don't need to fear you don't need to be scared just open yourself up and I will feel that and push that fear out of your life amen that's what he's trying to say to us and what it is friends because remember a slave back then they didn't have shoes that's how you could tell a slave back then they wouldn't have shoes and they'd have a band either around their arm or they have a band around their neck showing that they're a slave and when the prodal son came back home one of the first things that the father said get my shoes and get my robe out of my closet what is it friends he don't wants to make sure you're not slave me me mentality you are born again son and daughter of God you have all authority that Jesus Christ had that's what he wants you to understand amen let's stand amen thank the Lord friends It's a Wonderful Life to Live as a Christian here in is our love me perfect that you have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world a Christian absolutely I'm just like my father I'm the same person as he is amen there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear ha torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love so God cuss fits a message for us that we can actually respond to because he made it for you I'm standing here this message is custom f for me this is why I say you know have you heard from your theophany well I've heard from my theophany I heard from it tonight it's my word body and it's speaking to me right now amen I thank God not everybody has the same things only the bride has it amen let's let's just have a word prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I'm so thankful for your grace in my life and father I need you so much more than I've ever needed you before father take my hand lead me through father I just want to say Lord we love you I want to have more of your love Lord come through me Lord Jesus push all that fear out of me Lord God that father that we have an understanding and a position that you you given US citizenship you given us because we're in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus Oh father I know that Satan's going to come along and try to disprove that but Lord you've given the church not a spirit of fear but Lord you given us love you given us power Lord God and Father you given us a sound mind we're here tonight with a sound mind being able to hear the gospel we thank you for that Lord Jesus we thank you for what you've done for us father father go with us now Lord and bring us back safely tomorrow night and tomorrow morning Lord God father as we hear from another speaker Lord Jesus that you use that vessel and Lord to speak to us Lord Jesus Oh granted pray father I ask these things in your precious name in the name above every other name in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's sing Amazing Grace amen amen amen it's amazing grace friends amen amen God bless you my brother amen Amen brother amen Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that sa a rich like me [Applause] I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see oh it was Grace that had taught my heart to fear and Grace my [Music] [Applause] fears how preious did that gra of you the are I first oh through many ders TOs and snares Hallelujah already come his grace has brought be safe the SM and Grace Will Lead Me Oh when we in there [Music] [Applause] 10,000 years bright [Applause] shining as the sun we know last days to sing God's praise and when we first be let's worship him now oh praise God praise God hallelujah thank you Lord praise your name thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah thank you Lord God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God Amen did you enjoy that tonight I could preach another hour and a half just trying to fill in the gaps that I know he left out cuz he knew he didn't have enough time to do it but you know he was talking about those seals and you see every time those seals came those first four seals brother BR would say remember there was anointing to meet the challenge as the enemy came up the spirit of God raised up an anointing to perfectly match and in the first one it was a lion and it was the Bold powerful word in its pure but then it went into an ox age and then he raised up a man in Martin Luther and he he he brought the cunningness and the ability of a man to to take it and turn it back on on what Satan was trying to cram down our throats but in the last stage there's a different anointing and it takes us not just back to the original word it takes us back to the original original word back before anything was there into eternity itself before we ever existed in anything other than his thoughts and his mind and it brings us back and it shows us who we are amen it shows us that he's got something for us to be doing here and when you catch the anointing you're under you cannot do anything else but what that anointing is causing you to do those in the days of the Dark Ages they walked willingly because the anointing could not let them do anything else they were so surrendered they were so in tune with that anointing that they walked up mothers saw their children ripped apart and fed to the lines and nothing could hold them back because there was an anointing there that they had caught hold of they had caught the word for their day and the anointing that came with it produced that very word amen the response of God is an anointing to make the word live and that's what we're trying to catch today I love how he said every promise of God is built on adverse conditions I noticed none of us said praise the Lord but we're in the darkest of times yeah exactly and when it seems like nothing is going right yet he is calling a bride out of it and not a bedraggled not a beat down bride yeah this is a bride that has Victory amen they shall know their God and they shall do exploits what is it she has surrendered to the anointing of the age which is a prophetic anointing that takes her all the way back to where she came from in the very beginning amen he read in Romans eight he says as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God but he said ye have not received the spirit of bondage again you know when he read that I was reminded of that scripture where Paul says you did run well what did hinder thee you were running so well what held you up that idea of a of a speedboat with a a 440 cubic inch motor in it running around and around in a harbor getting nowhere quickly yeah what's held us back Church yeah what's held us back in our lives fear fear to let go of the shore isn't that what brother brandom said you want to stay close you want to stay tight you want to hold to what you had and not move into what God has for you he is the I am he is the everpresent he was there yesterday he's going to be there tomorrow but where is he today he's identified with the I am bride the one that knows that she is with him and he is with her amen he says you've received the spirit of adoption because that's the anointing of this age is to take you into full spiritual maturity it's where you and Christ are one amen there is no difference he says he is she and she is he exactly right it is the unity of the bride and the bridegroom in this age the spirit of this age is to bring us into a body change which is the literal joining of the bridegroom with the bride and we get to spend eternity with him amen I ask you what will hold you back tonight what will hold you back what's been burdening you Jesus what's the fear that Twigs in that little corner of your heart and says not for me it's for somebody else we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear what's bound you whether Jerry and I were talking in there he had a sister come up we heard our little testimony of Mary Beth he had a sister come up in his church and he was preaching on the authority of the word that was riddled with cancer wasn't it in her throat no sinuses she clogged up her lungs and everything had to have these breathing apparatuses and everything and she stood on the word and she was instantly healed of a debilitating problem in her life we've heard a message of Freedom tonight you can go free if you want to remember that slave that refused what happened they took him to the temple and they bored a hole in his ear and he could never be free but the bride has a Grace that's over her amen we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony that his word is true and his grace just keeps coming and coming and coming and coming until what we finally lay hold of it and say that's for me that's my word that's my promise that's my age that's my message that's my freedom that he's talking about there and she lays hold of it and he sets her free as we read he who the sun sets free is free indeed it's a finished work amen let's sing that [Music] song be it unto me according to Thy word I want you to take your need before him if you have a need and you want prayer brother Jerry's here to pray for you I'm here to pray for you Brother Paul's here to pray for you brother Barry's here to pray for you brother Jim's here to pray for you or you can stay there in your in your she in your seat and you can say lord it's mine but I believe there's a spirit of Freedom that's available amen there's a liberty in the spirit that we have not yet received all the way and I say this Lord I Want More am I want more you know I I'm a I love so many times when they do a prayer line and you know what happens afterwards the ministers go right through and they pray for each other cuz we all need more amen we need a greater freedom in the Holy Spirit we need to know who we are we need to be reminded we're forgetful hearers so as we sing this song say Lord I want to receive your word a little more tonight I want to lay hold of the promises I've been too scared to take hold of I want to let go of trying and I want to start just receiving a finished work by the promise of your word amen let's sing it each one be it unto me according to your word according to
