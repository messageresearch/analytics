for what's coming our way heavenly father and though Lord it may appear to be far in the distance Lord maybe we can't see it can't understand it Lord yet Lord knowing what you've done ought to give us faith that you'll do what you promised you would do heavenly father and Lord we're standing here Lord as testimonies Lord of your grace and your goodness heavenly father and we thank you for it Lord we thank you that you gave your life that we could have it Lord that you gave up the very Breath of Life so that it could come in and inhabit our bodies nor they could take a sword into a life with you Lord that it could draw us into a resurrection and a Rapture Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this morning Lord and as the song says we give you the glory the honor and the praise Lord for It's For Your Glory that we were made in the first place Lord we pray you help us to show it help us to be it Lord help us to personify it each one Lord as individuals Lord that the character the people will be the beauty in this church Lord in that you minister to Hungry Souls through us we pray Lord touch us now we ask Lord minister to your pride here this morning Lord those listening online Lord may you just speak into hearts and lives Lord may you strengthen Lord weary Hearts may you Lord stiff and feeble knees Lord hold us up Lord let us take on that Shield of Faith Lord and hold that sword of the word ever tightly and press forward in Faith Lord God we pray Lord speak now we ask in Jesus name and God bless you if you would turn to Exodus 33 Exodus 33 amen good to have brother Chad back and sister Leah from their trip trusting God's leadership and blessing there amen I'm certainly grateful for the service the atmosphere this morning song Special by Sister Maureen that was wonderful and just in line with what we'll be speaking about this morning Lord willing and then it can be sometimes when you're in a series and you start to think well we're just following a set path and it's just the way it's going to go but I do believe that God ordains each and every service and he puts things right in the timing that they need to be and he anoints not just the minister to speak it but he anoints the the people to worship and prepare for it and and these different things so I'm trusting his grace and Leadership this morning amen Exodus 33 and verse 12 says this and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou Wilt send with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I might find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest amen God bless you can have your seats this morning and then we are continuing the series on Redemption and I just want to take a single service on this this thought this morning of the promise of his presence amen the promise of his presence and it it stands out to me that Moses was a man that spent a lot of time in the presence of God he was a special man he spoke lip to ear with God as few others did throughout all of scripture and Moses had a covenant with God and Moses had the promises of God and Moses had a burning bush experience and Moses had seen the Redemptive work of God and the power and the signs and the wonders of God and yet we see here that Moses is struggling a little bit and he's saying Lord you've told me to do something and then it doesn't seem like it's obvious what you're going to do you've told me you're going to do something and then nothing's happening and you've told me to call out a people and now you're mad at the people and he's saying I don't know what you want me to do God I don't know where you want me to go I don't understand you say this and then you do that and Lord It's not making sense to me but I want to kind of bring us back to even when they they left Egypt and and kind of set a tone this morning for the leadership and the presence of God in our lives and how he works and in Exodus 23 he's this is this is God right after he left the children of it led the children of Israel out of Egypt and he says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I prepared and I know we spoke on this many times before but I want you to show you the effect of our actions on the presence of God under the law and then under grace and how those things work because you see here that as soon as God takes them out of their bondage out of their slavery out of their habits out of these different things he's ready willing and able right then to lead them he does not free us so that we can just go willy-nilly here or there that we walk out in Freedom and then start to do things of our own choosing but God is waiting right outside the jailhouse if I could put it that way to lead you to where you're supposed to be going and he says to Moses I'll send an angel and we cover before this is not just an angel but this is the Angel this is the capital a angel this is the presence of God this is Christ himself saying I'll go before you and I'll keep you along the way until we get to where we're going and then I'll take you into there as well and that is the promise of God of his presence in our lives is that if I've called you out I'll take you in and I'll be with you from the start to the Finish amen he's there to take us and lead us and we know that Israel followed that Pillar of Fire for months and God said I'll send an angel and that angel was hidden inside that Pillar of Fire that pillar of cloud and it was nothing less than the presence of God himself and it was veiled in front of them and during the day was a pillar of cloud and the presence of God was a shade it had a cooling effect it made their way easier and then at night it was a pillar of fire and it would Center on the day the pillar Cloud would lead them and in the night the pillar fire would Center itself over the camp and it would give them a fiery light so that they could have security and they could rest knowing that nothing could sneak up on them and so the people should have been able to look at that and say no matter where we're going we're not following a man we're following God because the cloud LED them and then the pillar fire stayed in their midst so they didn't have to say what's Moses doing because the cloud was leading doesn't Moses know the way to Canaan we could cut off months if we just headed directly there why are we going this southerly route and these different things but it was God in their midst and right after God destroys the Egyptians he takes them to a mountain to prepare them to worship Him and remember he calls Moses up on the mountain and Moses is gone for 40 days and 40 nights and the people start to what they start to create an excuse as to why they should move on why they don't need to wait and they come to Aaron and they twist his Rubber Arm and they say Aaron Moses is probably dead up there we need a God so fashion us a God and he went and he made them a grave and image he made them the golden calf if you remember and they greatly sinned there and God never forgave them for it it may got a little bit mad if you remember because he came down and he told Moses he says separate from them I'm going to destroy the whole lot under the law your actions had serious consequences under the law you had no hope it was judgment judgment judgment and we see God willing to do that many times but as we see here he caused the plague to fall on the people and many were killed and they lost beloved people there because they didn't wait on God and they tried to get ahead of God and so Moses is coming up and he's standing in the gap Moses was a real Shepherd he stood in the Gap and he said Lord I know there are flawed people I know they have problems I know they make mistakes I know they're unthankful I know they're Unfaithful but God you're the one that called us out you're the one that told us to come this way you're the one that delivered us out of the hands of the Egyptians you're the one that brought us out of slavery so lord it's your calling that brings us here not our own and he reminds God of his own word and if you read these scriptures off times it it seems makes God seem human that he gets mad but that's not the way it is because God has to hold to his own word and when they disobeyed that way then judgment was supposed to be the only thing that they could have and God indeed had to judge them somebody had to pay a price we know these different things but Moses nearly Driven Crazy by the people by their unfaithfulness by their thanklessness their short-term memories their unwillingness to see the supernatural presence of God with them he always stood in the Gap and he always said they're my people and they're your people and you've called them out don't destroy them but Watch What Happens Watch What Happens here it says and the Lord said unto Moses depart up and go up hence thou on the people which thou has brought up out of the land of Egypt under the lamb which I swear unto Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob saying unto thy seed will I give it so Moses convinces God don't kill him God says okay go up but watch the shift here in verse two he says and I will send an angel before thee capital A is gone now it's a little angel now it's just a messenger from God now it's just a different voice it's not the personal presence of God but now he's sent to necessary now he sent somebody to represent him he says and I will drive out the Canaanite the Amorite the hittite the parasite the hivite and the jebusite says I'm still going to do what I said but I'm not going to go with you unto a land flowing with milk and honey he says for I will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiff-neck people lest I consume thee in the way so look at the difference here after the people I created and worshiped a false idol God says you'll have Supernatural leadership but it's not going to be me I'll be telling that angel where to take you but I won't be in your midst your stiff neck you're stubborn you never learn you're always whining you're always complaining you always let circumstances dictate your attitude and your approach to me you have short-term memory loss you're never in it for me you're always in it for yourself and you never have the faith that I'm going to take you all the way through he says you've heard me speak you've heard me do signs and wonders in your midst my very personal presence is over you every single day and yet you forget it as soon as circumstances change he said if I stay with you I'll consume you if I stay in the middle of you all you're going to get is Judgment because I know the kind of people you are this isn't a judgment sermon this morning this is under law I'm showing you where what it could be but it's not where we're at but God said I can't stay in the middle of you like this because I've got to stay Sovereign to my law and my law says you've got to be judged and if I'm there I'll judge you immediately but you'll see there's times in the scripture where the people do something and quickly Mo Aaron runs and he gets incense and he stands in the Gap and it holds things back God gives that Gap or that delay to allow for an atonement to allow for a sacrifice to be made to hold off his judgment and that's what that Gap was supposed to do there but God says I'll go I'll be in the land I'll I'll put them out he says but I'm gonna I'm just gonna give an angel to sit to take you along the way here I won't stay in the midst of you anymore we see God's willingness to judge quickly throughout we remember they whined about food and God set them quail and as soon as their their teeth touch the quail then it made them sick and people died in there and then David and Cora stood up and tried to assume a leadership and Authority position and what happened God killed them he killed their families he killed their followers swallowed them up immediately Miriam spoke against Moses and God calls her into his presence and he and he he puts leprosy on her just like that that's the way God said was going to happen if he stayed in the middle of them that way there would be fast and immediate judgment and God didn't even want to do it he says I've got to separate myself from you I'm glad we're not under the law I'm glad we're not under the law church but it behooves us to be thankful is my other point I know I read this the other day but I want to say it again in first Thessalonians Paul said in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you and that's the lesson the children of Israel never learn they never learn to give thanks because God was with them no matter what and that's as mature Believers especially what we're supposed to do we're supposed to recognize that God has created a path of life for us it's a program and everyone's program is a little different each one of those programs Falls in line with the word of God but yet God does things differently and he deals with us differently he deals with us as we are and he's got a path or a program laid out for us and sometimes it's hard and painful and sometimes it's fun and enjoyable but no matter what whether it feels good or whether it feels bad yet it is God's path and program for us and we're supposed to be able to give thanks no matter what's going on in those situations amen listen the good times and the bad times are both equally of God it's all him it's all him no matter what it looks like no matter what it feels like but God said listen I can't stay in the midst of you anymore otherwise it'll be bad for you and he withdrew himself for their sake can you imagine that because his presence was going to be judgment if he stayed in the midst of them so watch what happens after God says this says that Moses took the Tabernacle and pitched it without the camp so he took up the the Tabernacle that this was the the temporary Tabernacle and he takes it and he moves it outside of the camp because it used to be the Tabernacle was in the midst of the people God's supposed to dwell in the midst of the people but God said I can't be there so Moses takes a tabernacle he moves it outside the camp afar off from the camp and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that everyone which sought the Lord went out into the Tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp catch us now what is it it's an individual affair now if you want God you got to go get God you can't just be associated with a message of redemption you can't just be associated with the message of Deliverance but you've got to go to the god of that Deliverance you've got to go to the god of the earth that Redemption and you've got to separate yourself from the unbelief and go in one-on-one with God and say God I'm here to talk to you that's the requirement today is after after God separates and we see it even in Revelation 3 he says behold I stand at the door knock he's outside of everything and you've got to be the one that goes to meet him you've got to be the one that lets him in it's got to be an individual Affair you had to leave the unbelievers and come to God individually verse 8 it says and it came to pass when Moses went out into the Tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after after Moses until he was gone into the Tabernacle and it came to pass as Moses entered the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses so now God drops down but he's outside the camp and he's only going to talk to his prophet it says in all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door as I read that I thought if they could stand and worship because they saw the far distant presence of God what about that to do in our midst amen if we know that he's with us if we know that he's here if we know that he's promised to be in our midst and what ought that to do with our worship if they could worship seeing God maybe a kilometer away from the camp what ought that to do when we know he's in our very midst this morning amen what is it that could ever hold back our worship and our praise when he's with us all along amen when we know that he'll never leave us or forsake us verse 11 says in the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again unto the camp but his servant Joshua the son of none a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle I want you to notice Joshua's what he's going to be the next leader and God has chosen Joshua to be the one that's going to take them into the land and Joshua sees Moses leave the presence but Joshua stays there why because Joshua wants to stay in the presence of God striking so often that you know it will come to the end of a service and and we boot it right out the door and my question is why are we inclined to leave so quickly when the presence of the Lord is here and when he's moving in his Blessing listen sometimes he may not be working with you but when you see somebody else is working on we ought to stay here and we ought to pray and set an atmosphere and hold that person before the throne of grace amen our desire should be to be where the presence of God is most strongly felt amen so when we're in here I encourage you stick around pray worship praise after the service when God's moving don't hold back when God has made himself known then jump in jump in while the waters are stirred amen get the blessing while the blessings available because guess what it's going to be harder and harder to get into the presence of God I do believe because Satan is pressing more and more into this Earth and so that means the presence of God is going to be pushed more and more out of our daily lives not our lives but out of everything that's around us and we're going to be more and more isolated we need to get strength while strength is here we need to enjoy the presence of God while he's here amen and Moses said unto the Lord see thou say a son to me bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom thou will send with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou has found Grace in my sight so Moses is saying Lord you've told me to bring out a people and then you said that you're going to depart from us and then you said we're going into Canaan Lord I feel like we're in limbo here it's like we're being blessed and cursed at the same time you said you know us by name you said we found Grace in your sight but yet I'm having to go outside the camp the people have to go outside the camp to be with you what's going on he's saying Lord I don't know what to do with what you're saying you're giving me mixed signals I don't know what to make of this situation so Moses says now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people listen Moses knows he's called to lead the people so he said Lord if I don't have Clarity of Direction then the people aren't going to have Clarity either so he says Lord show me your way and if you go into the Amplified he says show me your way that I may know you better that I may draw closer to you so that as I get closer to you your leadership becomes perfected through me and that I can lead the people as you meant me to lead them he's saying Lord get me close to you so that I can help them get close to you as well so that I can keep them in your will so that I can keep them in your way because if I fall they're going to fall as well so he said Lord first do it in me Lord first do it in me and that way the people can be helped and they can be held where you want them to but as I was looking at this I was talking with my wife the other day about this it's not wrong to ask God for clarification it's not wrong to say Lord I don't understand sometimes and I don't know about you but sometimes you make it you're facing a decision and it can look like there's two roads that you can take and both of them will be right but I believe there is always a single perfect will of God but sometimes it looks like there's two ways I write and you say Lord I don't know what to do each of them seems okay by the word and I'm not really against one or for the other it seems like there's two ways we could go here and you can say Lord what is your will and your way because it seems like I can't determine it right now what do I do in this situation what do I do with these this person what do I do with this relationship what what way do I go Lord I don't know what to do because it seems like you're okay with both but we know there's always a perfect will there's always a perfect will we were talking about Mary when Gabriel comes to her and he says you're going to have a child and it's going to be the Messiah and she says to the angel how can this thing be seen I know not a man she says I've never been intimate with the man so how is this going to be she wasn't asking in doubt or from a lack of faith but she was saying Lord angel I don't understand Gabriel I don't understand how this is going to happen and what did he say he said the Holy Spirit shall overshadow thee now that was an answer but that probably didn't give her a whole lot of understanding because I doubt that Mary knew the moment she got pregnant but yet it happened but he said here's how it's going to happen is it's going to be a holy spirit anointing that's going to make the life come to that there that's going to bring a life inside of you he gave her the answer when she said can you can you clarify what you're talking about can you tell me how this sort of thing is going to happen but Moses says Lord I need to be closer to you and I need you to show me your way and watch how God answers Moses because God doesn't tell Moses yeah I'll show you my way watch what he says he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest did he say Moses I'm going to tell you before hand every step you're supposed to make I'm going to tell you what happened I'm going to tell you what to watch out for I'm going to lay out the whole Plan of Redemption in front of you Moses so that you know the beginning to the end and you can have full confidence did he say that no he didn't he said I'll go with you that's God's answer to every situation is I will be with you and you'll know my will because you'll be with me my will is where I am my will is where my presence is my will is where my word is so if you stay with me you'll know my will I'll be with you Moses and I will give you rest for every moment my presence will bring rest my presence will bring peace my presence will bring assurance and that's where you're going to have to rest Moses I'm not going to tell you everything listen what happens when God tells us everything we try and get ahead of him the problem when we know too much is that we try and make it happen brother Branham would talk about that gift and he'd have the visions and he said you know before I could pray or before anything would happen a certain hat had to be here and this had to be there and brother random could maybe see where that cloak or that cat was and he could have gone and moved it but he knew that that was not why God gives Insight so that you can make it happen but brother Brown said as soon as somebody came and put that hat there then I knew that I could move forward because God had shown me but brother Branham learned to hold back and let it develop on its own but most of us don't have that sort of patience and we don't have that character to just hold on and say all right Lord you've given me Insight I won't try and force the issue I won't try and make it happen amen why because this is a walk of Faith Church it's always a walk of faith we've got to be able to trust when we can't see we've got to be able to trust because he's here not because we see so far down the road amen so God didn't say to Moses I'll show you my way now he said I'll show you my way as we go by Leading you along the way that's his answer his answer is my presence will go with you Moses and that's how you're going to get closer to me I'll be a constant presence I'll be a constant peace I'll be a constant Joy I'll be a constant leader I'll be there constantly Moses and that's what you're going to have to rest in amen I said it before I think the greatest attribute for a Believer is rest it's rest listen if Christ could sleep in the storm that was about to sink the ship then what we ought to be able to do when things are going so poorly when we're uncertain when things don't look like there's a a clear path we ought to be able to say Lord I'm resting Lord I'm trusting Lord I'm believing Lord I am persuaded that because you are in the ship with me everything's going to turn out okay Lord as long as you're with me then I know it's all going to be okay no matter which way it goes it's all going to be acceptable it's always going to be good it's always going to be for my good Romans 8 says this he says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father that word ABBA is is indicative of a close relationship it's not it's not the baby Dada thing I hear that preach so many times but that's not it I think I've even preached it but as I was I was studying into it it's that it indicates that you are familiar with them that you have close relationship with him and that's why you can call him Abba he says you can come because you have a closeness you can come because you have a relationship and whatever you ask I hear you and I'm always available to listen to you that's what kind of a spirit he's given us by the holy spirit is one that can come and say Dad I'm in need father I'm in need and he's there and he hears us every single time it says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God now after God says this to Moses I love Moses response because he said he said my presence will go with thee and I will give thee rest and Moses says and he said unto him Moses said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence church if we could lay hold of this one idea this morning Lord if you're not with me don't send me out listen if you're going to sing a special be anointed if you're going to pray be anointed if you're going to preach be anointed whatever it is say Lord if you're not with me there's no point to me stepping up there there's no point to me sitting behind that piano there's no point in me getting behind that microphone because you're the Difference Maker you're the one that makes it happen Lord church it's not us we have no power in ourselves it's him and us that's the hope of our glorious Christ inside of us oh that song says without him I could do nothing without him I'd surely fail without him I will be drifting like a ship without a sail Moses knew that God in their midst was the Difference Maker that's the difference this morning for us Church the difference for us is not that we have an end time message the difference for us is not that we have an identified group of Believers but the difference for us is that Christ is in our midst and if we ever put him out if we ever put him out we are no different than anybody else you can have this message and never have him in your midst and you will go the same way of a denomination he in our midst is the Difference Maker and Moses knew it Moses knew from 40 Years of making a mess up in in Egypt and killing somebody and having to flee he knew that he would fail every single time but as soon as he had a burning bush experience as soon as he had a commission where God said I'll go with you as long as you do this that was the Difference Maker in Moses life and he was never the same after that amen church it's got to be God or all the way through or it's never God at all there is no such thing as 90 percent God it's got to be all him or none him listen sometimes we we get into things and we presume that because we have a gift or because we have a calling that we can just go do things and God will bless it no we're supposed to be led we're supposed to be inspired we're supposed to be given an unction we're supposed to be directed to do things and I can say for myself there have been times where I've presumed on his calling and not sought his perfect will or not gotten his motive and objective and he's left me hanging out in the wind because I presumed because I presume that he would go with me no I've got to wait on him I've got to wait on him and we have to do the same thing amen Moses the greatest prophet in the Old Testament I don't think it's I don't think anybody can dispute it the greatest prophet in the Old Testament listen if Christ was modeled after Moses to me that makes Moses the greatest prophet in the Old Testament he learned that without God he was a failure and if that goes for him it goes for each and every one of us amen listen to this brother Bradham says this he says those Brethren that came out of Pentecost up there they were convinced that he was all they needed and they were convinced that that's all the people needed was him we're talking about his promise of his presence this morning he says when people came out of Pentecost up there what came out of what the upper room what did they preach they preach you can have what I have this is that this is what you need and I'm convinced the same thing he says they don't just tell me I have to speak better and have to do this and do that and stand still behind the pulpit he says that's psychology you say well the better class of people attend he said God's class of people will attend it he works on both ends of the line remember the Common People heard Christ gladly I'm convinced that the people don't need a great big long string of this that or the other I'm convinced because I know what it did for me and I'm convinced it'll do the same for them yes sir I'm convinced that he will meet all their needs I'm convinced that he will meet all others needs he said I was reading the other day of Hudson Taylor many of you read of him the great missionary to China there was a young man come to him one day a boy about 14 15 years old he said Mr Taylor I believe I have a call in my life to be a minister when I get to be about 25 years old he said you know what I'm coming to join your school and I want to learn Mr Taylor the Christian gentleman said Son don't wait till the candles have burned down go when it's lit that's right you don't need no schooling of this and schooling of that you say well the candles just yet lit yes when it's lit well I don't know in ethiology you don't need to know go tell them how it got lit and maybe it'll light them he says what we need is a candle lighting time the power of the Holy Ghost instead of so much of this man-made dogma and Theological training I'm convinced that's what the people need whether he knows his ABCs or not whether he knows beans from spit split coffee if he will just let that candle get lit God will take care of the rest he says that's right I'm convinced that all that's all that he needs listen sometimes up here we preach deep things we get into the depths of the word and the depths of the Mysteries and that's wonderful and then some days we're preaching where the rubber meets the road in our lives and it's a simple basic things that keep us in our Christian walk and that keep us faithful to God Amen but when it comes to converting people the greatest thing the most powerful thing we can do is tell them what God's done for us listen there is no law against a testimony brother or sister you go to somebody and you tell them what God did for you what does it do it gives them a hope that they can get the same thing because the greatest thing you can say after what you say what God did for you is you say he can do the same thing for you it's an offer that they can have the same experience that you did amen that's what people are looking for they're looking for something that's real they're looking for something that's solid they're looking for something that's proven and so when they look at your life and they see what proof of something stable and real then then maybe that's an opportunity for them to come in and then they don't turn down the mystery then they don't turn down the doctrine because yours works more than theirs works yours does what theirs won't listen sit down with a trinitarian sometime and try and convince some of the godhead you won't get anywhere but you sit down you tell them what God's doing in your life that he's not doing in theirs maybe they'll listen listen we can't argue somebody into a conversion but if you can show them a life that's beyond what they have that's going to do something for them that your words never will otherwise amen listen I look around this congregation and from The Young to the old we've got people that can speak of and testify of the of the the healing of God of the Deliverance of God of the provision of God of the sailing saving of God of picking you up out of a crowd out of a family out of everybody and just reaching down with one finger and pulling you out from The Young to the old and we may be at different levels but we all have a reality of God in our lives and so whether it's our young brothers and sisters while they're at work whether it's the middle aged ones or the old ones wherever it might be I believe we have a testimony we can share with people of the reality of a living God today that's what people are looking for amen Moses continues he says for wherein shall it be known he says listen if you don't go with us then don't even send us up he says wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight he says how how are we gonna how are we gonna know how are the people gonna know that we found Grace in your sight he says is it not that thou goest with us in other words he says is not the sign of your grace your presence in our midst he says that's the only thing that separates us he says so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the children that are upon the face of the Earth as I said before the differentiator between the true children of God and everyone else is that God is with his children that's it and Moses is saying the only thing that separates us from the Hittites and the jebusites and all of these other things is that you're with us because without you we'd just slip and fall right into exactly what they're doing listen they'd already done it they'd already done it if you think about it they had already gone and worshiped idols already done what everybody else did but the only thing that would keep them in the way was if that presence was in their midst amen and if our and we're the same thing if you take God out of our midst Church were no different than any other denomination we're no different listen we're no different than somebody that doesn't even believe in God if God is not in our midst because it's what it's a false front it's not even a reality it's dead religion and dead religion is worse than no religion the emperor has no clothes amen that's what we're looking at he says Moses said God we know we found Grace if you go with us because that's the only thing that's going to keep us in the way and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name he says you found Grace in my sight that's a wonderful thing but he says I know you by name I want to dwell on that I know you by name this morning listen when Moses was standing in the gap for the people this is what he said to God he says yet now if thou Wilt forgive their sin he's saying Lord forgive the people forgive the people but he says if not block me I pray thee out of thy book which thou has written we tend to look at this idea of the book of life being something that's really only revealed in Revelation but Moses is a prophet knew there was a book written before the foundation of the world he says God if you don't forgive the people he says then you might as well wipe my name off because I'm attached to them you commissioned me to take them you commissioned me to Shepherd them you commission me to lead them in the way that you told me to lead them he says so if you destroy them you might as well destroy me because I'm attached to them they're what I'm bringing to you in the first place now we know this book that he speaks of is the Lamb's Book of Life and in Revelation it says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels so notice there's a book of life and there's everyone's names are in it but some can be blotted out some can be marked out and some will have to be left in there others can't be removed and we'll see that in a moment because they're there by predestination and the foreknowledge of God in Revelation 17 8 it says the Beast that thou saws was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into Perdition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is so there are names on the book and then he says there's names that were on the book before the foundation of the world and he says the ones whose babes are on the on the book before the foundation of the world they can't fall into a false worship they're going to be held all the way to the end and then speaking of a new Heaven and a new Earth in Revelation 21 he says and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth nor what neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life you notice sometimes it says Book of Life and sometimes it says Lamb's Book of Life they asked brother Branham after the seals they said is that two books he says no it's the same book but it's like and this is my words now but the Lamb's Book of Life is Like a chapter inside the book of life and in that chapter the names are there and they're always there they were there written before the foundation of the world by the written in the blood of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world and those names can never be removed and that's the ones that he's coming for that's the ones he's coming for those are the ones whose names are engraved in the palm of his hands amen and that's this is the people he says that are going to inherit the new Heaven and the new Earth those are the redeemed not just the saved the book of life is all the same but the Lamb's Book of Life is the redeemed we're talking about this and and we talk about he says I Know Thee by name and then he says I will give thee rest and then he says you found Grace in my sight and what we see there is a beautiful picture of what Redemption Redemption because Redemption is always a Grace work and it's related to your name because you have to be what you have to be a relative to that one and then it's what to bring you to rest bring you back to your place in your position we know that everyone that says they're a Believer is not always a believer many will say in that day Lord Lord have we not done this and that he says depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you but there are those whose names are in the book and those are the redeemed and those are the ones he's coming for and he says you found Grace and that's why I'm coming back for you that's why I'll be in your midst it's because your names are in the book you are the purchase you're the chosen you're the elected seed of God Amen we see Moses saying God you know him you say you know me my name you say you know us by name but without your presence it means nothing to us he says God you've got to be with us we've got to have that same idea today that he's got to be with us that the message without the god of the message is just a denomination that's what it is it's what it is because we'll put a period behind it and we won't move on you'll see that in tapes only in these different things is what they said is that was it it's done and they haven't moved on and they haven't moved on in the Holy Ghost because God has anointed a five-fold Ministry to take us into that Rapture and the Very Prophet they claim to believe said that there would be ministers that would take us into the rapture not us as men but what the Holy Spirit leading the church and anointing men to raise the faith of the people so that they walk into a new body but I want to bring this up this idea of the promise of his presence into our lives and into this time today as we start to close in a very familiar scripture Revelation 10 says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud he was clothed with a cloud in their days closed with the cloud in our day but it says in a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire so we have a mighty angel coming down again and this is Christ if you compare his description here versus Revelation 1 it's clearly Christ So This Is the personal presence this is the person of God coming down and it's not just an angel this is the mighty Angel this is Christ himself and he's clothed with a cloud which we saw in 1963 and then it says he has a rainbow over his head now we know that a rainbow is always representative of what a covenant since the day of Moses went after the the flood came and went and God says I'll never I'll never destroy the Earth by water again he did what he put his bow in the sky put a rainbow in the sky and that was representative of his Covenant so whenever God makes a promise it's represented by a rainbow and then we see here in Revelation 10 so that he is a covenant Angel because he's coming down with a rainbow over him what it means is he's coming to fulfill a covenant he's coming to fulfill a promise that he made and we know what that promise is it's I will be with you I'll be in you even to the end of the age I will be a god unto you and you will be my people it's the Covenant of Abraham that is given to his seed amen and so what we see here is Christ coming down to finalize the final chapter of that Covenant that's what he's doing as he steps down it says in verse 2 and he had in his hand a little book open not a big book brother Brown says there's not many gonna make it it's not many going to make it he says in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth now we know in Revelation 5 that the book was sealed and then the lamb came and he took the book and between Revelation 5 and Revelation 10 the seals were opened and the details were shared with us but the details are are all in mystery form they're not written in plain English just to read them you wouldn't have a clue what it was talking about but yet in Revelation 10 we see a mighty Angel Christ coming down and now the book is open and that means that's the time for the revealing of what was going on and what's going to happen that's the end time and he says he's coming down to reveal those mysteries for a purpose and it's to do what fulfill the final portion of his Covenant it's a Redemptive book so it's all tied to Redemption it's not tied to Doctrine it's not tied to mysteries for the sake of mysteries but it's a Redemption mystery hidden in all of these things so what is this book we know it's the book of redemption it's the Lamb's Book of Life it's the title deed of redemption brother Brown would say and it's a record of all of those that are what elected predestinated and sealed by God and whoever owns it holds it is the one that owns it so Christ comes down it's his redeemed it's his purchase bride that he's coming down for now brother Brown would say this he says oh you see in this book was what was redeemed it was a book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book all that he died for was written in the book and he could not leave his mediatorial seat until he had thoroughly redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay on there to make intercessions until that last person was finished he says Glory what is it he can't finish the work until the last one's in we can't get out of here until the last one's in and he says that's why he couldn't come and take it right after of Calvary because there was two thousand years of people yet to come and he had to stay and stand in the Gap and cover our sins and hold back judgment until that last one's in and then he can step out and he can say now I'm coming for what's mine notice what he's doing is he sets a right foot on the on the the land and the left foot on the sea remember brother Brown said footsteps is possession and what's he doing is he standing on what belongs to him he's coming to claim what he has redeemed he's coming to claim what he he he he paid for Calvary brother Brown would say the lamb have redeemed it but he could not come forth until every name was revealed and that was taking place under the Sixth Seal before the seventh broke then the lamb came for what he had redeemed he come to claim what he had redeemed he's already got it right here in the book taken it from his hand but now he's coming to receive what he has redeemed that's his work he's done he's coming to receive it he says oh what a time he has proven it the seventh seal proved it he's come back and took the book of redemption so what's he doing he's calling names he's naming names he's proclaiming to his bride that I'm coming for you and it's time to go into the marriage supper of the land that's what the opening of the seals was it's the calling out of the Bride it's the calling out of the redeemed to go and be with him amen that's why we focus so much on a resurrection and a Rapture that's the final stage of this Covenant the Holy Ghost is given the last stage is for us to walk out without seeing death that's why we focus on it that's what separates us from most churches today is that we are focused on a resurrection and a Rapture and that's all we see left that's the last thing that's the last thing we see is us going out of here it says and he cried with a loud voice is when a lion roared what is it that's the king's voice that's a ruler's voice that's the voice of authority and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write this is John now it says and I Heard a Voice from having seen unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so John had a clear understanding of what was written under those Seven Seals he understood the full events under the Seven Seals as much as a man can the only thing he wouldn't know is the day and the hour of what the Rapture because no man knows that but all the details all the Mysteries hidden there all the events that were there the voice says to him John seal it up it's not meant to be understood beforehand it's meant to be understood later after most of it is done because I'm going to set up something I'm going to set up the final stage of redemption verse 5 says in the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there in our and the earth and the things that there in Earth and the Sea and the things that which are therein that there should be time no longer now remember that's Christ because by him were all things created and all things were created for him so Christ stands and he raises his hand and he says it's time to finish this it's a finished work I'm going to come down and I'm going to finish this it's time to wrap up the church ages it's time to wrap up Redemption for the Gentiles it's time to open the book and bring out those that have been written in there amen what is it remember he swore by who he swore by himself this is reflective of the what unconditional Covenant to the bride he's reminding us this is me going to do the work you're the recipient I'm the one that's going to do it I'm coming down and I'm going to fulfill my Grace Covenant in its totality now verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet so this prophets this is our time amen this is the seventh angel Messenger to the seventh Church age the laodicean church age and so we know we're there we're here right now this is our time in fact we're past this time we're past this time amen we've already heard that angel and his purpose was to declare those Mysteries and be the last prophetic voice to the Gentiles but what does that what does that Ministry reveal why do the seals matter to us because they reveal the working of God through his Redemptive process they show us insight into what God's been doing all along and it's revealing what the final mystery God above us God With Us and now it's what God in us that's the final mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory displayed for the world to see that's what he's revealing you'll see brother Branham even I was just listening to a portion of adoption this morning he was and he finishes the first the first uh sermon and he says now he said he said Just Lay Your Hands on the people he says you don't even have to pray he says and the way it should work is that you come up here and I say sister so and so are you a Believer yes I'm a Believer then according to that you are heir to all the promises receive your healing and go praising Jesus name that's what he said it was about was what letting you know the mystery is in you that you are the mystery revealed it's Christ in you coming out and it's restoring to your position your possession the blessings the very presence of God in your midst you say brother John what's happening with that seven angels Ministry he's speaking from an open book he's speaking from an open book but he's not calling your name he's telling you how God is calling you out he's revealing what God has been doing all these times he's showing the full mystery of redemption brother Bradham didn't call my name the mighty Angel called my name but it was an angel voice it was a seventh angel voice that said wake up the bridegroom's coming he's almost here make yourself ready and he told us how to get ready and he told us how to get the dirt out of our lives and he showed us what was holding us back and he was preparing us for what the mighty Angel to read our name out of that book and say you're coming with me now brother Brown would say this he says nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentiles see that's all the book holds that mystery the book is only unfolding it now listen what he says not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names so there's a name being called and it's yours and it's mine but he says the revealing of those Mysteries was to show us how God is doing it to show us what God did before through six Church ages so that we'd recognize that he's going to keep on the pattern he's going to do what he did in those six and the Seven that when times looked bad and through Dark Ages yet he preserved a people so that as we come into Leia to see the worst of all of them we can have confidence that God is working to preserve a bride and keep her out of it and keep her safe and draw her out into a resurrection and a rapture brother Branham showed us the mystery of God working through all of those times when it looked like God had done nothing to so many why so that you'd have faith now when it looks like nothing is happening at times he says you finally understand that now see the book doesn't say now levale is to be saved in the time of this church age or benevolar whoever no it doesn't say that he says it just shows the mystery it unfolds the mystery of what the thing is he says but we ourselves by faith believe it what we believe that God is doing what he said he would do he says that's what I said the other night so the mystery is revealing to us the working of God in our lives and that is what something we respond to by faith because we believe that's him calling our name that's what we have in this message amen as a as a seven Church AIDS Messengers speaking his message what's happening is a bride is being called out and the scripture says the bride hath made herself ready prophetically we're going to be ready Church he said we're going to be ready he said we're going to be spotless he said we're going to be without wrinkle and that's what this seven Church age messenger is doing is he's making us ready brother Bram says if I can only get her to stand still what I'll dress her the way he wants her to dress I'll prepare her for her wedding what was he doing brother Branham came and he would sound so hard so many times because he would just go and he'd cut and he'd cut and he cut and he says you cannot walk this road with God and be in a denomination you cannot walk this road with God and be in your high heels you cannot walk this road with God and be cutting your hair you cannot walk this road with God and be taking what you believe to be right instead of what he believes right you cannot walk this road with God and ignore the word you cannot walk this road with God and not have a prayer life you cannot walk this road with God and not have the Holy Ghost and he did it time and time again he says you cannot do it the way you've been doing it you've got to come out to him and you've got to be made known to him and he's got to be made known to you brother brother Brian would say but there are some that's got their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life and when them seals are thrown open there they see their name there and the Holy Spirit speaks to them they come it's not a name he's saying but what's he doing is he's speaking the word and the deep inside of you calls to the Deep that's being expressed and you say like that little Eagle in the chicken yard that's me and you hear a name and it was what an eagle calling out to you and you know that because it speaks the same language you have the same lineage you have the same bone and Bone flesh of Flesh and you say that's me he's calling me that Mama Eagle wasn't calling a name she was calling though and he heard his name in The Call he recognized that because he understood the voice he understood what it was saying he says that's got to be for me and he did what he took off and he flapped his wings and sure enough off he took and he went up to be with her he says they come you can't keep them away no one can no one they're coming anyhow because you're leading them like you did those little birds and the sheep and the cattle Thou Art God remember he talked about in India I think it was they they they had a an earthquake but hours before the earthquake all the animals went into the center of the field where there was nothing to fall on them or hurt them or anything and they huddled there way before why because God had given them an instinct God had given them something that would warn them of impending judgment and so they went to where it was safe he says some Instinct that them animals have that they know that they must get away and if instinct to an animal could warn him to flee from danger what should the Holy Spirit do to a church that claims to be filled with it if we aren't separating church then something's wrong isn't it because this world is fraught with danger to the believer there's nothing good here there's nothing worth blending there's nothing worth taking there's nothing worth asking for in this world Amen our world is not here our home is not of here it's of another kingdom it's of another place listen this Mighty Angel is Christ himself and he has come down and he descended in 1963 we know that he descended and what was it it was the opening of the word it was the opening of that book and it was the final stage it was the final step of our Redemption process and what did Brother Branham say he said this is my Ministry to declare him that he's here what did John say once Christ was there he says I must decrease and he must increase brother Bradham hasn't even preached the seals yet but he says my Ministry is to declare that he's here what is it Hebrews 13 8 was the was the the scripture for brother Adam's Ministry Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and he says he's the same as he was when he walked this world in flesh no difference he says except the Corporal body he's here his presence is amongst his people to do what he said he was going to do why why was he declaring him that he's here because if he doesn't walk with us Church we're not going anywhere but if you know he's here now you can start to walk and you can start to move into the promises of God you can start to move into relationship with God you can start to move into the possessions that are promised to the children of God more than you ever have before because that's what he promised to come and do in this last Church age was to bring us into the final portion of his Covenant where nothing will be held back from us nothing will be held back from us Jesus said in that day if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it but then he would say if two or three of you agree then I'll do it and then he'd say if you ask according to his will then I'll do it what was he doing was he was pointing to the fact that those things come with a relationship with the bridegroom that's what he was driving us back to amen we can't hope to restore ourselves back listen the world's been trying to do it we've got self-help books we've got you know uh just about anything you can think of today they've got a book for it they've got a program for it they've got a plan for it and guess what it doesn't change anybody it'll help you it'll help you cope but we're not here to cope we're not here to cope Church we're here to overcome we're here to overcome we're here to get the Victory and that's going to take the working of Jesus Christ in each and every one of our Lives personally amen listen what did he say it reminds me of prophet of God was talking about the the the the Hebrew children in the fire and the angels are reporting back to God what's going on there they're walking up and the they they've turned the fire up seven times hotter lord they're about to be burned to a crisp and it's going to be bad it's going to be bad it's going to be bad and he says now they're walking up they're getting closer all the soldiers just died they're still walking forward Lord what are we going to do what are we going to do and he says God said I will go down and that's the exact same thing he said in the seventh Church age he said what I will go down this is my Covenant this is my promise I personally will come down in the midst of the people and perform that which I said I was going to do and I won't stop until every single one whose names are written in that open book are where they need to be what is it sealed with the Holy Ghost sealed with the Holy Ghost I'm going to invite the musicians to come I want to read one more scripture as we close this is Psalms 139 I'm going to read most of it says O Lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and mine Uprising thou understand it's my thoughts are far off thou compasses my path and my line down and are acquainted with all my ways that means I you surround my life my walk whenever I'm up whether I'm down whether I'm sleeping whether I'm walking around you're acquainted with everything I Do Lord for there is not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord thou knowest it altogether thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me what's he saying there Lord You've surrounded my life says and laid thy hand upon me laying out of hands is Anointed is pointing to two things it's always associated with healing and it's associated with anointing he says such knowledge is too wonderful for me it's high and I cannot attain to it whether shall I go from thy Spirit we're talking about the promise of his presence Lord where would I go from your spirit or where shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there thy hand shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me the right hand of power and authority Church we're not holding on to him he's holding on to us that's the working in this Covenant amen if I say surely the darkness will cover me even the night shall be light about me if you say Lord there's no way out there's no way this is too bad it's too dark it's too hard it says even the night will be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou has possessed my Reigns Lord You've LED and guided me to where I am today thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous I thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet be made unperfect and in thy book all my members were written every part of us was known and predestinated by God beforehand It Was Written beforehand he says which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts on to me oh God what did Jeremiah Say he repeats God and God says my thoughts are of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end how precious are thy thoughts unto me o God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more than number in the sand when I awake I am still with thee what it means there is if I fall asleep counting your blessings Lord when I wake up I'm still counting because I cannot count them all amen God bless you let's stand this morning amend the promise of his presence I want to encourage you this morning he never said it would be easy never said it would be simple but he said he'd always be with us and that's what we hold on to when we can't see what seems like darkness is around us seems like things are pressing in our Only Hope and Faith has to be that Lord you're here and I'm walking in the light as you're in the light and that's what's going to take me all the way through that's where our faith is is in his presence in the promise of his word and that he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them we've gathered together to enjoy his presence this morning amen but he's there even when we walk out the door he's there when we're sitting on our bed when we're driving in our car when we're having our devotions when we're unsure of which way to go he's there and he will provide a way and he'll give the answer that we're looking for amen amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what rest and Assurance we need to have this morning and Lord we know that not is all perhaps going well today Lord we know that there are struggles there are trials there's sickness Lord there's doubt there's uncertainty Lord there's tiredness there's stress in our midst Heavenly Father but Lord we're praying for your presence Lord to be made real to us each one Heavenly Father Lord that if we can rest Lord if we would confess with our mouth Lord I believe helped out my own belief Lord if we could say Lord we are assured Lord we're convinced Lord we're certain that you'll do what you said Lord it puts you into action Lord and it allows you to move forward in our lives Lord will we rest Lord will you help us to rest in the promised Lord that you came down in this age and you're here in the midst of your people to do your Mighty Works Lord to bring us to that fullness of redemption Lord the very change of our body Lord bless us now Lord be with us Lord we hold up our pastor's wife sister Betty once again Lord Jesus Lord praying that Lord a special Lord anointing will be upon her Lord that you would surround her Lord

anchored to the promises of God lord and that her faith and trust would be in you Lord we're holding her up in prayer each one Lord May our faith just bind together Lord as your holy spirit will move

different offices obviously this year has been a bit tied up with the church and trying to get settled in here so now we're coming to a point where we feel we owned a building let's move into elections so that's what this announcement is about here at the moment uh there's been a bit of change uh brother Mark He has expressed that he's going to step down from a couple of his positions uh the first one being Sunday school superintendent so he's stepping down from that officially and it's been recommended that brother Paul Coffey take that position so when we have the vote his name will be going forward onto the ballot for that position also better Mark stepped down from trustee uh and he's it's been recommended that brother Dale take that position so his name will be going forward on the ballots we've checked with these brothers and they both agreed for their name to go forward I'd also like to pause here at the moment and Express Thanks for brother Mark in those roles over the years he's been very very faithful and diligent and we should thank you very much for that us especially over the last six months without dealing with all the legals uh matters concerning this building and real estate I'd very much appreciated my God bless you richly for your efforts but a Market's not out of the picture he's going to retain his role as the treasurer and again we thank him very much for being diligent in that area as well and that he continues Lord willin in the days and years to come when it comes back to the matter of the election Lord will we will have that next Sunday uh side note this Wednesday due to Renovations service is going to be canceled so Lord will have the election after service next Sunday um so just to run down real quick there so some new faces here there's a few requirements to be able to vote uh you could be 18 years of age regular ties payer and a regular attendee for at least six months and you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is all straightforward no problem for anyone here um also I'm almost done here by our announcements after church here as you know about the pews the trustees have asked anyone is going to help if you can meet up with brother Bob afterwards and he'll explain the the plan going forward for moving these pews out so that we can get the renovations going starting tomorrow and that's all I have there was anything I missed Joe all good okay that's it for announcements any questions I will mention too if anyone feels that their name should go forward on the battle for any of these positions or openings just like myself brother Joe know and we'll take it from there but as it is Wednesday if all the renovations are done and everything's back in place we will have the vote on Sunday all right on that note I'm going to close the service down let's begin stand to our feet and we're just closing the word of Prayer our dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you
