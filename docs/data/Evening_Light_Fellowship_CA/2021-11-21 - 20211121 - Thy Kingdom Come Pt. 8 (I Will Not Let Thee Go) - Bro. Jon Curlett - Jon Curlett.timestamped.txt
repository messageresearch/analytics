[40:43] especially grace to the hearer we pray
[40:45] lord god lord have the preeminence lord
[40:48] we pray lord we invite you to take the
[40:50] service now in your name we ask you amen
[40:53] amen
[40:54] amen god bless you thank you musicians
[40:56] that'll be it
[40:57] man if you turn the scriptures to
[40:59] genesis chapter 31 genesis 31
[41:03] amen
[41:05] certainly appreciate the song service
[41:06] this morning it was uh right on point
[41:09] as you'll see as we get into the into
[41:10] the service this morning so we praise
[41:12] the lord
[41:13] amen it's good to have the holy ghost
[41:15] leading and preparing the people's
[41:16] hearts amen
[41:18] and then god bless you genesis 31 and
[41:21] verse 1 says and he heard the words of
[41:23] laban's son saying jacob had taken away
[41:26] all that was our father's and of that
[41:28] which of the which was our fathers had
[41:30] he gotten all this glory and jacob
[41:34] beheld the countenance of laban and
[41:35] behold it was not toward him as before
[41:38] and the lord said unto jacob return unto
[41:41] the land of thy fathers and to thy
[41:43] kindred and i will be with thee amen god
[41:46] bless his word you may be seated this
[41:48] morning amen we're taking a bit of a
[41:50] different direction this morning playing
[41:52] a little bit off of the last service and
[41:54] then we're going to be continuing on thy
[41:55] kingdom come
[41:57] and thy kingdom come is all about the
[41:58] reality amen it's all about the reality
[42:00] of the word the impact of the word how
[42:02] we act how we live the things that makes
[42:04] us do the things that keeps us from
[42:05] doing and all these different things and
[42:08] we'll continue on that side of it a
[42:09] little bit this morning but this service
[42:11] this morning i want to speak on a title
[42:13] of i will not let thee go amen and this
[42:15] is kind of a natural progression i think
[42:17] from our last service where we talked
[42:18] about that that priest that royal
[42:20] priesthood amen the ones that are there
[42:22] to to offer sacrifices and intercede on
[42:25] behalf of themselves and their families
[42:27] and the different ones that god puts on
[42:28] their heart and puts under their
[42:30] authority and under their sphere of
[42:31] influence amen
[42:33] but we want to take our text from the
[42:34] story of jacob this morning it's a very
[42:36] familiar scripture i know but i want to
[42:38] take a little bit of background before
[42:40] we dig too deep into this and i want to
[42:41] start with his name and his birth amen
[42:44] your name matters and your birth matters
[42:45] if you didn't know that we'll know it
[42:47] after we talked with jacob this morning
[42:49] amen we're born under a name
[42:51] and that name has an impact on our lives
[42:53] the prophet teaches it the word teaches
[42:55] us that that our name has an impact in
[42:57] our life it has a an impact on our
[42:58] nature and then we want to see the
[43:00] pattern here we want to see how jacob
[43:02] progresses and and how we can do the
[43:04] same thing so let's turn back to genesis
[43:06] 25 genesis 25 and uh this is speaking of
[43:10] of jacob's birth it says and the lord
[43:12] said to her this is rebecca his mother
[43:14] two nations are in thy womb and two
[43:16] manner of people shall be separated from
[43:18] thy bowels and the one people shall be
[43:20] stronger than the other people and the
[43:23] elder shall serve the younger now we
[43:25] know in the old days the oldest son was
[43:27] always there without exception the
[43:28] oldest son was always the heir it didn't
[43:30] matter if he was good bad and different
[43:32] ugly handsome didn't matter if he was
[43:34] smart if he was stupid didn't matter if
[43:36] he was spiritual and spiritual no matter
[43:38] what the eldest son was always going to
[43:40] be the heir and so god's kind of turning
[43:42] things on their heads from the beginning
[43:43] with rebecca here and he's saying listen
[43:45] you're not going to be having a normal
[43:46] family structure here you've got
[43:48] somebody that's you've got two nations
[43:50] coming out of you not one nation it's
[43:51] amazing he's saying there's going to be
[43:53] a division in the family from the births
[43:55] of these two boys he says and one of
[43:57] them is going to be stronger than the
[43:58] other and and the older one is going to
[44:00] serve the younger so he's setting a
[44:01] division there right from the very
[44:03] beginning the other thing he's showing
[44:04] is he's showing favor
[44:06] amen we don't like to think the world
[44:07] doesn't like to think that god shows
[44:09] favor but guess what god shows favor
[44:11] amen he shows favor to his children he
[44:13] shows favor to his seed he shows favor
[44:16] to those that are predestinated to what
[44:18] to become the sons of god and those
[44:20] above all else receive the favor of god
[44:22] and then it's not just blessings favor
[44:24] it's also as we talked about it's a it's
[44:26] the correction it's the discipline it's
[44:27] the working of god to draw them into a
[44:29] place where they can be what god has
[44:31] called them to be amen so we see here
[44:33] that god is showing favor to one and
[44:35] it's not the one that you would normally
[44:37] think god would show favor to
[44:39] amen it says in verse 24 and when her
[44:41] days to be delivered were fulfilled
[44:42] behold there were twins in her womb and
[44:45] the first came out red all over like in
[44:48] hairy garment and they called his name
[44:50] esau
[44:51] and after that came his brother out and
[44:53] his hand took hold on his on esau's heel
[44:56] and his name was called jacob so we see
[44:59] even in their womb they were fighting
[45:01] even in their womb amen before they came
[45:03] out their contrary natures were showing
[45:05] and then it's not common for babies to
[45:07] fight in the womb amen but she spoke and
[45:10] even she knew even from the beginning
[45:11] that there was something going out there
[45:13] and what is it it's god's predestinated
[45:15] seed fighting with those that are not
[45:17] predestinated they're fighting for power
[45:19] they're fighting for position they're
[45:20] fighting for authority in there amen but
[45:22] it's a natural struggle there and that's
[45:24] not what we're called to do is it but we
[45:26] see that nature even coming out the
[45:27] predestinated nature of jacob have i
[45:29] love and esau have i hated guess what
[45:31] when those two are put together then
[45:32] it's like oil and water they don't mix
[45:34] and there's always going to be conflict
[45:36] in the carnal side of things amen you
[45:38] cannot get along oil and water and then
[45:40] they just won't mix even if you shake
[45:42] them together and they mix for a second
[45:43] there comes a point and then they've got
[45:45] to separate and the oil will flow to the
[45:46] top and the water will go to the bottom
[45:48] it's just the way it is amen
[45:50] but we see here his name was called
[45:52] jacob and the name jacob means
[45:54] supplanter now that doesn't mean
[45:55] anything to most of us these days so
[45:57] planter is not a common word it's not a
[45:59] common term but when you look at the
[46:01] word subplanter now it means one who
[46:04] grasps
[46:05] right so he grasped esau's heal when he
[46:07] was coming out trips up or deceives
[46:11] amen it says one who seizes one who's
[46:14] circumvents know what it means to
[46:16] circumvent
[46:17] take a shortcut
[46:19] right one who takes shortcuts or usurps
[46:22] that means take somebody else's position
[46:24] so jacob's name is one who seizes takes
[46:27] shortcuts takes someone else's position
[46:29] and trips up and deceives other people
[46:32] and this is the son of god
[46:34] this is a predestinated son of god and
[46:36] coming out of the womb this is what he
[46:38] is described as is one that is basically
[46:41] he sounds like he's a child of the devil
[46:43] quite frankly doesn't he if we're to
[46:44] look at him naturally if we look at the
[46:46] meaning of his name there's nothing here
[46:48] that would say this is a son of god
[46:50] but yet this is what god wanted him to
[46:53] be named from the very beginning amen
[46:54] and so brother branham calls jacob he
[46:56] says he was a shyster
[46:58] right jacob was a con man jacob was a
[47:01] man that was always looking for an edge
[47:02] he was always looking for an angle he
[47:04] was always looking to get ahead he was
[47:06] always looking to take something that
[47:08] while he thought it belonged to him
[47:10] wasn't necessarily his and certainly not
[47:11] the way that he thought that he was
[47:13] going to take it amen he was always
[47:15] looking to take something that didn't
[47:17] belong to him amen amen
[47:19] like i said he has a character now to
[47:21] match this name he has a character to
[47:23] match it
[47:24] his name was it basically meant shyster
[47:26] and that's all jacob did his entire life
[47:28] until he comes to a certain point
[47:30] jacob's a shyster all the way along he's
[47:32] always looking to manipulate things to
[47:34] change things to benefit him rather than
[47:36] looking for the big picture and what
[47:37] benefits others
[47:39] verse 27 says and the boys grew and esau
[47:41] was a cunning hunter a man of the field
[47:44] and jacob was a plain man dwelling in
[47:46] tents
[47:48] jacob was a towny we'd say these days
[47:50] right
[47:50] he dwelt intense he was a mama's boy he
[47:52] stayed home he took things easy he
[47:54] wasn't out in the field he wasn't out
[47:55] hunting amen it's like matt and me
[47:59] okay
[48:00] right that's what it was a man of the
[48:02] field and a man of the chair in the desk
[48:04] right that's what we've got there now
[48:06] i'm speaking nothing spiritually in that
[48:08] in that comparison brother matt as we
[48:10] know but you have a you have a big
[48:12] division between their natures don't you
[48:13] where their inclinations their hobbies
[48:15] and guess what again most of us would
[48:16] say esau was probably the one that was
[48:19] maybe more spiritual out in nature you
[48:21] know out and doing these things and a
[48:23] provider and he was out there and he'd
[48:24] make things happen he was a big strong
[48:26] man a hairy man a man's man a man among
[48:29] men right
[48:31] but he wasn't a child of god was he
[48:32] jacob the mama's boy that stayed at home
[48:34] that was god's man
[48:36] and said and isaac loved esau because he
[48:38] did eat of his venison
[48:40] it does it's funny most of us would like
[48:42] our sons because of a good character
[48:44] they do things esau was like because he
[48:46] brought home food that isaac liked you
[48:48] know i'm not sure if that's what i'd
[48:50] like my dad to love me for is because of
[48:51] the food i brought home it says but
[48:53] rebecca loved jacob now i want you to
[48:55] catch there it says jacob was a plain
[48:57] man now that word doesn't mean that he
[48:58] was you know he wasn't flashy but that
[49:00] word plain means perfect complete
[49:04] sound
[49:05] wholesome morally innocent and having
[49:07] integrity
[49:08] so we have a man that is named shyster
[49:11] and yet the scripture says he was a
[49:12] plain man perfect complete sound
[49:15] wholesome morally innocent having
[49:16] integrity so what we have here is a man
[49:18] that's at odds with himself because
[49:20] internally we would say in his heart he
[49:23] wants the right things but when it comes
[49:25] to his actions he's doing it completely
[49:28] on his own he's he's acting by the way
[49:30] of the world but his heart is close to
[49:32] god right so we've got a man that's
[49:34] twisted up we got a man that's fighting
[49:36] with himself because his heart's right
[49:38] but he can't seem to wait on god for
[49:40] things he tries to put things into
[49:41] action himself amen and so he's always
[49:44] working against his own nature he's
[49:46] always fighting it amen does that sound
[49:48] familiar amen we can end up fighting
[49:50] against our nature amen what is it our
[49:52] heart wants to do right paul talks about
[49:54] he says when i would do those things
[49:55] which are good i find i don't do them
[49:57] and the things i don't want to do i want
[49:58] to do them amen we have that nature that
[50:01] is constantly fighting against us and so
[50:03] we've got a soul nature and we've got an
[50:05] outside nature and the problem is which
[50:07] one's going to win amen now jacob we
[50:09] know from these points from early on in
[50:11] his life
[50:12] it comes to the forefront which one is
[50:14] winning doesn't it right we see exactly
[50:16] what's happening with with with jacob
[50:18] because jacob wants the birthright now
[50:20] here's the thing god said the elder was
[50:22] going to serve the younger he didn't say
[50:24] jacob was going to get the birthright
[50:25] did he
[50:26] he didn't say how this was going to
[50:28] happen but jacob says i've got to get
[50:29] that birthright and so he works to bring
[50:32] esau to a place where he'll give it up
[50:34] now esau brings it on himself he comes
[50:36] home from hunting and he has no food
[50:38] he's had no luck and he comes in and
[50:39] jacob has a stew already prepared
[50:42] and he says i need some food and jacob
[50:44] says no no no no buddy you got to give
[50:46] me something for my stew i'm not going
[50:48] to share with you we might be blood but
[50:50] this is my stew
[50:51] right this is my stew jacob wasn't a
[50:54] good guy all right this is my stew and
[50:56] so esau says well what do you want he
[50:58] says give me your birthright
[51:00] and you know why esau gives it to him
[51:03] the scripture says esau despised his
[51:05] birthright he had no care or concern for
[51:08] having that he was satisfied to be the
[51:10] oldest the biggest the strongest the
[51:12] best hunter he had no what concern or
[51:15] care for that birth rate why because it
[51:17] had a spiritual attachment with it it
[51:19] wasn't just physical authority but
[51:20] whoever has the birthright the firstborn
[51:22] had the full care of the tribe of the
[51:25] family beneath them it was not just the
[51:27] physical taking care of them but it was
[51:28] the spiritual taking care of it as well
[51:30] and esau just wanted to be able to do
[51:31] his thing and so the scripture says he
[51:33] despised it it means it was meaningless
[51:35] to him it had no real worth so he traded
[51:37] his birthright which was the blessing
[51:39] and control of the entire family and
[51:41] tribe for a bowl of stew
[51:43] that's what it was worth to him it was
[51:44] worth less than a bowl of stew if we
[51:46] could put it that way man
[51:47] so what's the disconnect we see here we
[51:49] see jacob valuing the things of god but
[51:52] he's scheming to get them right he's not
[51:54] willing to sit and wait he's not willing
[51:56] to sit and let the word and the prophecy
[51:58] of god come to pass but he's trying now
[51:59] to get these things
[52:01] and he's trying to hold him to himself
[52:03] and get them his own way
[52:04] and here's the thing once he gets the
[52:06] birthright then what does he do after
[52:07] that he's not satisfied with just the
[52:09] birth right now now he goes and he
[52:11] deceives isaac to get the firstborn's
[52:13] blessing because regardless of whether
[52:15] you had the birthright there was a
[52:16] special blessing for the firstborn and
[52:18] then he goes and he deceives isaac he
[52:21] puts on remember he goes and he kills a
[52:22] goat and then he goes and he puts on the
[52:24] fur of that animal on his arms so that
[52:27] he feels like esau that's how hairy he
[52:28] was he felt like a goat right he puts it
[52:31] on him and then he goes into isaac and
[52:34] he deceives isaac and gets isaac to
[52:36] bless him
[52:38] right and have you noticed with jacob
[52:40] when he goes in he ties god into his lie
[52:42] because remember
[52:44] esau leaves and goes to hunt deer
[52:46] because these isaac says go get some
[52:47] deer cook the venison the way i like it
[52:49] and then come in and i'll give you the
[52:50] first born blessing isaac or esau runs
[52:53] out and all of a sudden we have what
[52:55] jacob comes in you know maybe an hour
[52:57] later and he's got this already and
[52:59] isaac says whoa that was quick he says
[53:01] yes god brought me the deer what he
[53:04] spiritualized
[53:06] what he was doing he was deceiving and
[53:08] he was tying god into his lie that's how
[53:10] low jacob was is he's tying god into the
[53:12] lie that he's doing to try and get the
[53:14] the firstborn's blessing amen amen we
[53:16] don't need to spiritualize our mistakes
[53:18] i was talking with a couple of brothers
[53:19] this week
[53:20] talking about our own lives and i said
[53:22] sometimes we've just got to realize we
[53:24] did something wrong
[53:25] right and what happens is we try and
[53:27] spiritualize it and all of a sudden you
[53:29] know what that leads to it leads to a
[53:30] religious spirit and then when we start
[53:32] sitting there and we start saying i made
[53:34] a poor mistake i made a bad decision
[53:36] that wasn't according to the word that
[53:38] wasn't according to the will of god and
[53:39] then we sit there and say well maybe
[53:41] that was god's will for me no no no
[53:42] let's not go there we'll let god work it
[53:44] out and then romans 8 28 still holds
[53:46] he'll work all things for our good but
[53:48] if it what it does is when we
[53:49] spiritualize it it keeps us from
[53:51] repenting because we're trying to say
[53:53] actually god was in it no no we don't do
[53:55] that we repent we say lord that was on
[53:57] me that was on me i made a mistake let's
[53:59] keep god out of it and go back to god
[54:01] make it right and then we can move on
[54:02] with it amen
[54:04] now we know what happened after this is
[54:06] esau get very angry because he gave away
[54:07] the birthright of his own free will but
[54:09] now he's had the the firstborn blessing
[54:11] stolen from him so he says and isaac's
[54:13] gonna die soon they know it he says as
[54:15] soon as soon as isaac's done as soon as
[54:17] the days of mourning are over i'm
[54:18] killing jacob
[54:19] and of course rebecca hears this and she
[54:21] says to jacob you gotta leave he's taken
[54:23] daughters from the the canaanites and
[54:25] what not his wives we don't want that
[54:27] i'm gonna send you back to my family
[54:29] take a wife from there and in the
[54:30] meantime esau won't kill you and then
[54:32] maybe you can come back when he's not as
[54:34] angry anymore so then we jump up to
[54:36] genesis 28 and says and jacob went out
[54:38] from beersheba and went toward heroin
[54:40] and he lighted upon a certain place and
[54:42] tarried there all night because the sun
[54:43] was set and he took of the stones of
[54:45] that place and put them for his pillows
[54:47] and lay down in that place to sleep and
[54:49] he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on
[54:52] the earth and the top of it reached to
[54:53] heaven and behold the angels of god
[54:55] ascending and descending on it and
[54:58] behold the lord stood above it and said
[55:00] i am the lord god of abraham thy father
[55:02] and the god of isaac and the lamb
[55:04] whereon thou liest to thee will i give
[55:06] it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be
[55:09] as the dust of the earth and shalt thou
[55:11] shalt spread abroad to the west and to
[55:13] the east and to the north and to the
[55:15] south and in thee and thy seed shall all
[55:17] the families of the earth be blessed
[55:20] and behold i am with thee and will keep
[55:22] thee in all places whither thou goest
[55:25] and i will bring thee again to this land
[55:28] for i will not leave thee until i have
[55:30] done that which i have spoken to thee of
[55:33] and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he
[55:35] said surely the lord is in this place
[55:37] and i knew it not
[55:39] and he was afraid and said how dreadful
[55:41] is this place this is none other but the
[55:43] house of god and this is the gate of
[55:46] heaven amen what would you do if this
[55:48] had happened to you can you imagine
[55:50] young brothers if you were setting out
[55:51] to find a wife and on the way you laid
[55:53] down and you had a tremendous dream a
[55:54] tremendous vision of the angels of god
[55:57] going up and down the ladder and god
[55:58] himself standing at the top of the
[56:00] ladder and then he comes down and he
[56:01] confirms the abrahamic coven covenant to
[56:04] you
[56:05] right this is now it's a god of remember
[56:07] it's the god of abraham isaac now it's
[56:09] the god of jacob he has bound himself he
[56:11] has committed himself to jacob on his
[56:13] way down he says look jacob i'll be with
[56:15] you everywhere you go but i'm going to
[56:17] bring you back to this lane because this
[56:19] is the land that you're really supposed
[56:20] to be in this is the land i've given you
[56:22] and then from there you're going to
[56:23] spread out and i'm going to bless you
[56:25] and you're going to go to the north
[56:26] south east and west
[56:27] we'd say praise the lord god's with me
[56:29] right and we'd have no concerns you
[56:31] would think about where we're going and
[56:32] what we're doing and how god's going to
[56:34] be moving in our life
[56:35] but watch what happens here because look
[56:38] this is god promising things to jacob
[56:40] the shyster
[56:42] all right jacob the deceiver jacob the
[56:43] man that's at odds with himself it's
[56:45] god's promise to a man that's still all
[56:47] twisted up mixing up the carnal nature
[56:49] and the spiritual nature that's inside
[56:51] of him amen and yet god comes down and
[56:53] he seals the covenant with him right
[56:54] there and he says i'm with you the same
[56:56] way i was with your forefathers amen i
[56:58] love that because what god has bound
[57:00] himself to us no matter what condition
[57:02] we're in no matter how fallen we are no
[57:04] matter how great we are no matter where
[57:06] we are it doesn't matter god has bound
[57:08] himself to us and he's bound us to be
[57:10] what a spotless perfect bride and so no
[57:13] matter what our condition is today no
[57:15] matter where we are no matter what we're
[57:17] doing no matter what we're not doing
[57:18] what he has bound himself to us and he
[57:20] says i'm going to return you to the
[57:22] place that you came out of amen i'm
[57:24] going to take you back to the land that
[57:25] i promised you and there's going to be a
[57:27] kingdom that develops out of that and
[57:29] i'm going to make sure that you make it
[57:30] and i'm committing myself to you even in
[57:32] your twisted shape amen even in your in
[57:35] trying to get things your own way even
[57:36] in pushing the way that you do even in
[57:38] the way that you're always striving and
[57:39] struggling it doesn't matter i'm going
[57:41] to make sure you come back and i'm going
[57:42] to bless you but you're going to have to
[57:44] come back to get the full blessing amen
[57:46] amen what he it's this covenant is not
[57:49] guaranteed by our actions it's not
[57:51] guaranteed by our perfect life it's not
[57:52] guaranteed by our perfect attitude our
[57:54] perfect motives or perfect objectives
[57:56] it's what based on what his choosing
[57:59] amen it's on his love it's on his
[58:01] thoughts before the foundation of the
[58:02] world and he put our names on the book
[58:04] of the lamb before we were ever born
[58:07] amen it's a wonderful thing it's no
[58:09] different than what jacob got here
[58:11] now watch jacob's response so this is
[58:13] god giving him the covenant and jacob
[58:15] responds like any shyster would he says
[58:18] and jacob vowed a vow saying if
[58:21] if god will be with me and will keep me
[58:24] in this way
[58:25] that i go and will give me bread to eat
[58:27] and raiment to put on so that i come
[58:30] again to my father's house and peace
[58:32] then
[58:33] shall the lord be my god programmer's
[58:36] known if then statement if you do this
[58:38] then i'll do that this is the shyster
[58:40] this is now he's saying okay god that
[58:42] sounds great really appreciate that
[58:44] thank you thank you
[58:46] if you do it then i'll make you my god
[58:50] he's just had a tremendous dream he's
[58:52] had a tremendous vision he's had god
[58:53] speaking directly to him and he says god
[58:55] if you do it then i'll serve you but
[58:57] until then i'm going to kind of be in a
[58:58] holding pattern right what is the
[59:01] shyster he's manipulating he's saying
[59:02] you've got to prove it before i'll ever
[59:04] serve you
[59:05] amen it says and this stone which i have
[59:07] set for a pillar shall be of god's house
[59:10] and of all that that thou shalt give me
[59:11] i will surely give a tent to thee. so he
[59:13] says in the meantime i'll give you a
[59:14] tithe
[59:15] but you're not my god until you bring me
[59:17] back and you give me the fullness of the
[59:18] commitment that you've made to me amen
[59:22] how would you handle this
[59:24] i believe if i had that i'd be shouting
[59:25] and dancing and hooping it up and
[59:27] praising my way all the hair and saying
[59:29] god's taking me out and god's bringing
[59:31] me in and i'm going to get a wife and
[59:32] i'm going to get a kid and then he's
[59:33] going to bring me back there and he's
[59:35] going to bless me and we're going to
[59:36] grow into a massive nation right that's
[59:38] not jacob jacob says oh i'll give you a
[59:40] tenth of whatever i have but we'll wait
[59:42] and see how this works oh god
[59:46] it's amazing we see it in the children
[59:47] of israel the supernatural experiences
[59:49] that they had and yet what happens they
[59:51] keep going back down to the base nature
[59:53] every single time except a couple right
[59:56] it takes something else to make this
[59:57] happen amen these these supernatural
[1:00:00] events and we want supernatural events
[1:00:01] we serve a supernatural god but the
[1:00:03] supernatural events like this are not
[1:00:05] what's going to hold us through our life
[1:00:06] amen there's got to be something that
[1:00:07] anchors us beyond that amen now we see
[1:00:10] jacob he comes to heron where his uncle
[1:00:12] laban is and he goes to work for him and
[1:00:13] jacob gets a taste of his own medicine
[1:00:15] doesn't he because he's the deceiver and
[1:00:16] then he meets the uncle that's an even
[1:00:18] greater deceiver and so jacob says hey
[1:00:21] laban says hey you're of my family you
[1:00:22] don't have to work for me for free what
[1:00:24] do you want jacob says i'd really like
[1:00:26] rachel for a wife so he says okay work
[1:00:28] seven years so he works seven years the
[1:00:31] scripture says it was as only a couple
[1:00:32] of days for jacob because his love for
[1:00:34] rachel was so great and then on the
[1:00:36] wedding night my only presumption is the
[1:00:38] scripture silent on it but my only
[1:00:40] presumption is jacob gets so drunk that
[1:00:41] when he goes into the bedroom then laban
[1:00:45] has swapped out rachel for leah her
[1:00:46] older sister and he goes in and
[1:00:48] consummates the marriage with a woman
[1:00:50] that he thought was rachel and then he
[1:00:52] wakes up in the morning he sees leah
[1:00:54] besides him he says whoa something
[1:00:56] happened here he goes goes to laban says
[1:00:57] what did you do you deceived me and
[1:00:59] lavin says well it's not our custom for
[1:01:01] the older to get married second she's
[1:01:03] got to get married first so i've given
[1:01:04] you leah he says wait a week we'll marry
[1:01:07] you to rachel and then you can work
[1:01:08] another seven years so jacob works 14
[1:01:11] years to get a wife that he didn't want
[1:01:13] and didn't love
[1:01:15] and he gets the one he wants as well so
[1:01:16] he gets deceived right up front right
[1:01:18] god's got a way of making us pay for the
[1:01:21] things that we do doesn't he he gets a
[1:01:22] taste of his own medicine amen scripture
[1:01:24] says be not mocked you know
[1:01:27] whatsoever a man sows that shall he also
[1:01:28] reap so reap after the spirit don't reap
[1:01:30] after the flesh amen because if you
[1:01:32] reach after the spirit you'll get life
[1:01:33] out of it amen
[1:01:35] but after that of course once those 14
[1:01:36] years are up jacob's paid his dues he's
[1:01:39] paid for his wives 14 years of working
[1:01:41] 14 years of working for your wives
[1:01:42] brothers that's a long time then laban
[1:01:44] says well how are we going to do this
[1:01:46] now and he says well give me all of the
[1:01:47] cattle that have strakes on them so
[1:01:49] stripes or circles or blemishes
[1:01:51] basically anything that's not a solid
[1:01:53] color will be for me out of all the the
[1:01:55] sheep and the goats and the the cattle
[1:01:56] and everything and you keep the solid
[1:01:58] colored ones so laban looks around his
[1:02:00] his flock and he sees it's mostly solid
[1:02:02] color ones he says i'm in good shape and
[1:02:04] so jacob starts to work for that and
[1:02:06] then what happens is jacob is still the
[1:02:08] manipulator because it talks about the
[1:02:10] things that he did to the water to make
[1:02:12] them
[1:02:13] have the the the speckled cattle and
[1:02:16] sheep and whatnot so jacob's
[1:02:17] manipulating the system and so all of a
[1:02:19] sudden laban looks out and he's seen
[1:02:20] jacob getting more and more and more his
[1:02:22] currents getting bigger and bigger and
[1:02:23] labans are getting smaller not only that
[1:02:25] jacob made sure that the stronger ones
[1:02:27] were the ones that made it to produce
[1:02:29] his and the weaker ones that made it to
[1:02:31] produce produce laban's flocks so he's
[1:02:33] he's not only getting more than laban
[1:02:35] he's getting the real good ones as well
[1:02:37] right and this goes on and laban changes
[1:02:40] his wages 10 times because he keeps
[1:02:42] seeing jacob get richer and richer and
[1:02:43] richer and him get less and less and
[1:02:45] less
[1:02:46] right
[1:02:47] why because he's a manipulator he's just
[1:02:49] like jacob right he's a shyster as well
[1:02:51] it's probably where jacob got it was
[1:02:53] through the the family lines that way
[1:02:54] amen but no matter what he did jacob
[1:02:56] always found a way to increase
[1:02:58] and you know who was doing that
[1:03:00] god the scripture tells us
[1:03:04] that god said look i've seen what
[1:03:06] laban's done to you and i've made sure
[1:03:08] that you're still blessed
[1:03:09] jacob the shyster because he's chosen in
[1:03:12] favor of god is still blessed even in
[1:03:13] his manipulating
[1:03:15] that's an amazing thing
[1:03:16] when god makes a commitment he makes a
[1:03:18] commitment amen and when he does it by
[1:03:20] himself not based on your behavior it's
[1:03:22] an even greater commitment amen but you
[1:03:24] look at jacob's life and he has no peace
[1:03:26] and no rest in it there's constant
[1:03:28] conflict there's constant tension why
[1:03:30] because he's taking away things from
[1:03:32] laban by deceit and manipulation and
[1:03:34] then laban's saying well that's not fair
[1:03:35] and he's going back and forth and back
[1:03:37] and forth changing these things so you
[1:03:38] have all this internal family friction
[1:03:40] because you've got two shysters and two
[1:03:42] manipulators trying to get the better of
[1:03:43] each other amen so it comes to the point
[1:03:46] where jacob says what this ain't worth
[1:03:48] it this ain't worth it i'm going through
[1:03:50] all this stress and it's tearing apart
[1:03:52] the family and i'm always worried about
[1:03:54] what's going to happen and this and that
[1:03:55] the other thing he says i just want to
[1:03:57] get out of this
[1:03:58] i've had enough of it amen amen have you
[1:04:01] ever noticed when you're trying to get
[1:04:02] things that god has promised your own
[1:04:04] way you're always fighting
[1:04:06] why because you're usually fighting with
[1:04:07] other people doing the same thing right
[1:04:09] you're trying to get something that's
[1:04:10] not in god's time for you yet and so
[1:04:12] what you're doing is you're trying to do
[1:04:14] it by way of your strength by your
[1:04:15] skills by your cunning and what happens
[1:04:17] is it always leads to conflict because
[1:04:20] god's not in it
[1:04:21] now god can bless you
[1:04:23] but god's not in it and you're always
[1:04:24] going to have that stress and you're
[1:04:26] always going to have that struggle and
[1:04:27] that striving amen
[1:04:29] what does it mean conflict is imminent
[1:04:31] right if it isn't there it's going to be
[1:04:32] here in a short time because you run up
[1:04:34] against somebody with the same attitude
[1:04:36] amen and so eventually jacob got tired
[1:04:38] of it he says i need to get out of this
[1:04:40] and i can speak from my own life when
[1:04:41] you tell god i'm sick and tired of this
[1:04:43] i don't want to do it what happens god
[1:04:45] opens the door right god when you say
[1:04:47] god this ain't worth it then god says
[1:04:50] great now i got you where i need you now
[1:04:52] i can show you something that is worth
[1:04:54] it come and talk to me for a little
[1:04:55] while amen and that brings us to our
[1:04:57] opening scripture
[1:04:59] genesis 31 says and the lord said to
[1:05:01] jacob return unto the land of thy
[1:05:02] fathers and to thy kindred and i will be
[1:05:05] with thee
[1:05:06] now he's saying go back and face certain
[1:05:08] death
[1:05:09] and i'll i'll be with you
[1:05:11] go back and face the music and i'll
[1:05:13] bless you
[1:05:15] this is no simple thing that he's saying
[1:05:17] to jacob go back because waiting back
[1:05:19] there is esau and esau still angry as we
[1:05:21] know and he's saying go back there and
[1:05:23] that's where i'm really going to bless
[1:05:24] you jacob you've had a taste of
[1:05:26] blessings but i'm going to take you back
[1:05:27] to the the real covenant now i'm going
[1:05:29] to take you back to the land of the
[1:05:30] covenant and that's where i'm really
[1:05:32] going to bless you but you got to face
[1:05:33] the music first
[1:05:34] amen like i said i i can say with
[1:05:37] confidence that when you start thinking
[1:05:38] about getting out of the racket god
[1:05:40] starts moving on your behalf
[1:05:42] amen when you start saying this isn't
[1:05:44] worth it
[1:05:45] god says great
[1:05:47] let's go someplace else let's give you a
[1:05:49] place where it's not a racket anymore
[1:05:50] where you can just trust and have
[1:05:52] confidence in the things that you're
[1:05:53] doing amen
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:59] i spoke about this so i'm going to skip
[1:06:00] it amen
[1:06:02] but he's talking to to jacob
[1:06:05] here
[1:06:07] and this is where he says that you know
[1:06:08] i saw the things for for laban verse 12
[1:06:10] says for i've seen all that laban doeth
[1:06:11] unto thee he says look i've seen that
[1:06:12] he's trying to cheat you
[1:06:14] he didn't say jacob i've seen you trying
[1:06:16] to cheat him that's the favor of god
[1:06:19] it's amazing what he'll do friends
[1:06:21] right he says i'm holding i'm holding
[1:06:22] laban accountable and i'm not letting
[1:06:24] him get away with it
[1:06:25] right but then verse 13 he reminds jacob
[1:06:28] he says i am the god of bethel i'm the
[1:06:30] god of that supernatural experience on
[1:06:32] your way out
[1:06:33] right i'm the one that met you i'm the
[1:06:35] one that gave you that dream that gave
[1:06:37] you that vision he says where thou
[1:06:38] anoints the pillar and where thou voweds
[1:06:40] devout unto me now arise get the out
[1:06:43] from this land and return unto the land
[1:06:46] of thy kindred amen
[1:06:48] so god's reminding him hey
[1:06:50] i've met you on the way out
[1:06:52] i'm telling you to go back
[1:06:54] now's the time we're going to go all the
[1:06:55] way back we're going to fulfill the
[1:06:56] covenant amen i want to ask you
[1:06:59] is is god the god of your covenant
[1:07:01] amen if you're facing situations if
[1:07:03] you're facing difficulties if you're
[1:07:05] facing struggles is he still the god of
[1:07:07] your covenant or are we sitting here
[1:07:08] trying to fight our way through it on
[1:07:10] our own strength right are we sitting
[1:07:12] here trying to push it through with our
[1:07:13] own nature amen are we trying to do it
[1:07:16] with our own skills or are we sitting
[1:07:17] there and we've got to sit back and say
[1:07:19] god you're the god of the covenant and
[1:07:20] you're the one that's going to return me
[1:07:22] to the original land amen origin is
[1:07:24] destiny remember brother brown preached
[1:07:26] on that what we've got to go back to
[1:07:27] where we were originally and to do that
[1:07:29] we've got to leave all the te all the
[1:07:31] pushing and the striving and the
[1:07:32] straining and we've got to have rest
[1:07:34] amen that's the defining feature of a
[1:07:36] believer is rest i believe amen where we
[1:07:39] rest on the promises and we rest that
[1:07:40] god is on our side that he's pushing
[1:07:43] things aside that he's parting the sea
[1:07:45] that he's parting the river that he's
[1:07:46] making things as if they were nothing in
[1:07:48] front of us and he's bringing us back to
[1:07:50] the land of promise that he talked about
[1:07:52] amen
[1:07:54] so jacob starts back and he's going to
[1:07:56] face esau he knows there's a reckoning
[1:07:57] coming
[1:07:58] jacob knows he did wrong
[1:08:00] and he knows that esau is none too happy
[1:08:02] about it he's vowed to kill him and that
[1:08:04] vow is still it's still hanging over his
[1:08:06] head amen but the problem with jacob is
[1:08:08] that every step he takes back the weight
[1:08:10] of that decision and the the choices he
[1:08:12] made early on in his life are weighing
[1:08:14] on him because why now it's just not him
[1:08:16] that's in danger but he's got two wives
[1:08:18] he's got children he's got servants he's
[1:08:20] got flocks he's got wealth he's got
[1:08:22] everything to lose now
[1:08:24] he's got everything to lose when he came
[1:08:26] in all he had was a staff and when he's
[1:08:28] coming out now he's got everything and
[1:08:29] if esau is mad enough he'll kill him all
[1:08:32] and he'll take what he has
[1:08:33] right
[1:08:35] the decisions we make early on can
[1:08:36] sometimes have that effect don't they
[1:08:38] right when the innocent lives come along
[1:08:41] right now they get affected by our
[1:08:42] decisions right we got to think about
[1:08:44] that up front we say well i'm willing to
[1:08:46] take that well is everybody else that
[1:08:48] comes after you willing to take it
[1:08:49] because there is a price to pay amen
[1:08:52] now watch as jacob's heading on his way
[1:08:54] in genesis 32 1 it says and jacob went
[1:08:56] on his way so god's already met him in
[1:08:58] heron and now jacob is on his way and
[1:09:00] the angels of god met him and when jacob
[1:09:03] saw them he said this is god's host and
[1:09:05] he called the name of that place
[1:09:07] mahanayam even though i'd have been
[1:09:09] pretty settled i think right there i met
[1:09:11] angels going out i had god talk to me
[1:09:13] going out i've got god telling me to go
[1:09:14] back and then on the way back now i meet
[1:09:16] the host of army angels right this is
[1:09:19] god confirming all the way along jacob
[1:09:20] i'm with you
[1:09:22] right i've seen angels is what jacob's
[1:09:24] saying this is an amazing thing this is
[1:09:26] a place of god's host
[1:09:28] this is who's coming with me
[1:09:30] we think we'd be okay
[1:09:32] we'd walk with confidence right but
[1:09:35] remember jacob is still jacob
[1:09:37] right jacob's still got the nature of
[1:09:39] jacob and so when he pushes forward this
[1:09:41] doesn't mean anything to him he's still
[1:09:43] waiting on the if then if you do this
[1:09:45] then i'll serve you right and he's not
[1:09:47] convinced of these things yet amen god's
[1:09:49] talking to him god's confirming his
[1:09:51] promises god's giving him supernatural
[1:09:53] events in his life and yet jacob still
[1:09:55] isn't convinced he still isn't at rest
[1:09:58] and we see that because as they get
[1:09:59] closer and closer to esau watch what
[1:10:01] jacob says
[1:10:02] it says and jacob sent messengers before
[1:10:04] him to esau his brother
[1:10:07] and to the land of seer the land of the
[1:10:09] country of eden edom and he commanded
[1:10:12] them saying thus shall you speak unto my
[1:10:14] lord esau he's my lord esau now not my
[1:10:16] brother my lord essa he's getting real
[1:10:18] respectful as he gets closer thy servant
[1:10:21] jacob
[1:10:22] thy servant lord and servant that's what
[1:10:24] he's talking like now he's humbling real
[1:10:26] fast isn't he thy servant jacob sayeth
[1:10:28] thus i have sojourned with laban and
[1:10:30] stayed there until now and i have oxen
[1:10:32] and asses flocks and men servants and
[1:10:34] women's servants and i have sent to tell
[1:10:36] my lord that i might find grace in thy
[1:10:38] sight now jacob's trying to appease the
[1:10:40] anger of esau right he's trying to
[1:10:42] weasel his way out he says look i've got
[1:10:44] lots of stuff here
[1:10:46] right we can make a deal esau you don't
[1:10:48] have to kill me we can make a deal
[1:10:50] it says and the messengers returned to
[1:10:52] jacob saying we came to thy brother esau
[1:10:55] and also he cometh to meet thee and 400
[1:10:58] men with him
[1:11:00] esau has no response if you notice but
[1:11:02] he's got 400 men and these are not foot
[1:11:04] washers and chefs and and people that
[1:11:06] set up parties amen this is not a family
[1:11:08] reunion he's coming for he's coming with
[1:11:10] 400 warriors and he's going to take out
[1:11:12] his revenge on jacob and his family
[1:11:15] amen it says and then jacob was greatly
[1:11:18] afraid and distressed and he divided the
[1:11:20] people that was with them and the flocks
[1:11:22] and the herds and the camels into two
[1:11:23] bands and said if esau come to one
[1:11:25] company and smite it then the other
[1:11:27] company which is left shall escape so
[1:11:29] where's his faith now
[1:11:30] god's already said i'll be with you
[1:11:32] you've got an angel host traveling with
[1:11:33] you but what happens is he can't see the
[1:11:35] angel host anymore and now god's not
[1:11:37] talking to him and now he's dividing
[1:11:39] things up and saying hey at least
[1:11:40] somebody or something will survive
[1:11:42] whatever comes next right he's going to
[1:11:44] find one but if we split up he can't
[1:11:45] find us both so one of them will get to
[1:11:47] safety and the other one will have to
[1:11:48] pay the price
[1:11:50] right what's he doing he's still trying
[1:11:51] to salvage something right still trying
[1:11:53] to do it his own way isn't he god
[1:11:55] already promised he'd take care of him
[1:11:57] he already promised he'd take him back
[1:11:58] there and he'd bless him and he turned
[1:12:00] him into this huge nation and he's
[1:12:02] sitting there and he's trying to split
[1:12:03] things up he's trying to get it done his
[1:12:05] own way
[1:12:06] right but watch what happens next
[1:12:08] because jacob gets desperate and he
[1:12:10] starts praying
[1:12:12] and jacob said oh god of my father
[1:12:14] abraham and god of my father isaac the
[1:12:16] lord which said unto me return unto that
[1:12:19] country and to thy kindred and i will
[1:12:21] deal well with thee
[1:12:22] what he's saying here is look you've
[1:12:23] been with my ancestors
[1:12:26] he says and you're the one that told me
[1:12:27] to go back so god i'm doing this because
[1:12:29] you told me to
[1:12:31] i am not worthy of the least of all the
[1:12:33] mercies and of all the truth which thou
[1:12:36] has showed unto thy servant
[1:12:38] he's starting to get humble now isn't he
[1:12:40] he's starting to get a little bit
[1:12:41] desperate isn't he
[1:12:43] for with my staff i passed over this
[1:12:45] jordan he says i just came over with a
[1:12:46] staff
[1:12:47] and now i am become two bands i have so
[1:12:50] much stuff and so many people and
[1:12:51] servants that i can split them up into
[1:12:53] two bands
[1:12:54] that's how much i have right so in other
[1:12:57] words he's saying god you've blessed me
[1:12:58] you've made me wealthy you've given me
[1:13:00] so much since i first came into here
[1:13:03] then he says deliver me i pray thee from
[1:13:05] the hand of my brother from the hand of
[1:13:07] esau for i fear him lest he will come
[1:13:10] and smite me and the mother with the
[1:13:12] children.
[1:13:13] god already said i'm going to take care
[1:13:14] of you man what are you worried about
[1:13:16] and he's saying i'm scared i'm still
[1:13:18] scared you got the the angel host with
[1:13:20] you you've got god committing himself to
[1:13:22] you jacob what's your fear esau
[1:13:25] right he's not convinced yet is he he's
[1:13:27] desperate but he's not convinced
[1:13:29] and thou says i will surely do the good
[1:13:32] and make thy seed as the sand of the sea
[1:13:34] which cannot be numbered for multitude
[1:13:37] he's reminding god of the promise
[1:13:39] but he's still not convinced
[1:13:41] he's reminding god of the promise but
[1:13:42] he's still not convinced amen sometimes
[1:13:44] it happens with us right we're reminding
[1:13:46] god of the promise but we still have
[1:13:48] fear lurking inside right right the
[1:13:51] question is did he make the promise to
[1:13:52] you or not and if he did then why are we
[1:13:55] fearful
[1:13:56] brother ernie villanueva says fear is
[1:13:57] false evidence appearing real have you
[1:14:00] ever heard him say that false evidence
[1:14:01] appearing real and so jacob has not met
[1:14:04] esau yet esau has sent no message of
[1:14:06] peace to him you know the scripture
[1:14:08] doesn't actually tell us that esau was
[1:14:11] going to kill him
[1:14:12] amen have you ever noticed that he's
[1:14:14] coming with 400 people but we see
[1:14:17] afterwards that he offers them to jacob
[1:14:18] to protect him on his way in for all we
[1:14:21] know esau had forgiven jacob already and
[1:14:23] was just happy to have his brother back
[1:14:25] we don't know if jacob was going to kill
[1:14:27] him 100
[1:14:28] we think it because jacob deserved it
[1:14:31] right
[1:14:32] yeah
[1:14:33] so jacob believes esau is going to kill
[1:14:35] him we actually don't know that
[1:14:37] right and esau's response maybe god
[1:14:39] moves on esau's heart and changes it we
[1:14:41] don't know but all we know is jacob is
[1:14:43] convinced that esau is going to kill him
[1:14:44] because he's coming with 400 men and
[1:14:46] he's sending no message of peace
[1:14:48] right
[1:14:51] that's right jacob's realizing one thing
[1:14:53] clock's running out
[1:14:54] right there's a showdown coming
[1:14:56] right he's going to have to face up to
[1:14:58] his decisions he's going to have to face
[1:14:59] up to what he said he's going to have to
[1:15:00] face up to what he did he's going to
[1:15:02] have to face up to his poor decisions
[1:15:04] and not only that his whole family is
[1:15:05] going to answer for it with him right
[1:15:07] but listen
[1:15:09] time to pay the piper but he's still
[1:15:10] jacob
[1:15:12] he's still jacob he's still the
[1:15:13] manipulator he's still the deceiver he's
[1:15:14] still the he's still the guy that's
[1:15:16] trying to negotiate right there's always
[1:15:18] a deal to be made with a shyster right
[1:15:20] we can always work something out right
[1:15:23] so for the sake of time we're going to
[1:15:24] skip the next few verses but he sends
[1:15:26] forward his animals and he sends them to
[1:15:27] esau take the animals right take the
[1:15:29] animals spare me take the animals take
[1:15:31] my wealth right he worked so hard and he
[1:15:33] manipulated so hard and god blessed him
[1:15:35] with those things and yet he's saying
[1:15:37] take it all just don't kill me right and
[1:15:39] he tells the guys go in bit by bit and
[1:15:41] send the goats in one herd and the sheep
[1:15:43] and the another and the cattle in this
[1:15:44] one and go one by one and as you come up
[1:15:46] to him say esau this is yours and the
[1:15:48] next one come up he saw this is yours he
[1:15:50] saw this as yours he says maybe this
[1:15:51] will hold him back right
[1:15:54] it says and this is what he said to the
[1:15:55] servants he said and say moreover behold
[1:15:57] thy servant jacob is behind us for he
[1:15:59] said i will appease him with the present
[1:16:01] that goeth before me and afterward i
[1:16:03] will see his face per adventure he will
[1:16:06] accept of me right in other words he's
[1:16:08] trying to buy esa off with god's
[1:16:10] blessings
[1:16:11] that he manipulated
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:15] so went the present before him and
[1:16:17] himself lodged that night in the company
[1:16:19] and he rose up that night and took his
[1:16:21] two wives and his two women's servants
[1:16:22] and his eleven sons and passed over the
[1:16:24] four jabbok
[1:16:26] and he took them and sent them over the
[1:16:28] brook and sent over that he had amen i
[1:16:30] want to realize i want you to realize
[1:16:31] the significance of this
[1:16:33] jacob is completely alone now
[1:16:35] everything that he has
[1:16:37] every blessing of god that he's been
[1:16:38] given every bit of wealth every bit of
[1:16:40] family everything is separated from him
[1:16:43] and he's standing alone on the other
[1:16:45] side of the river now
[1:16:46] it's just him no servants to protect him
[1:16:48] it's just him and his wits that's all
[1:16:50] he's got left and this was known as a
[1:16:52] place of robbers and thieves
[1:16:54] right this is not a safe place to hang
[1:16:56] out alone he sent everything ahead of
[1:16:58] him and now he's just staying there
[1:16:59] alone and the scripture says in verse 24
[1:17:01] and jacob was left alone and and
[1:17:04] wrestled a man and there wrestled a man
[1:17:06] with him until the breaking of the day
[1:17:09] now i don't know how many of us have
[1:17:10] wrestled i remember the good old days at
[1:17:12] the first baptist academy sleep-a-thon
[1:17:14] where we wrestled with the men that were
[1:17:16] way older than us and i remember bob
[1:17:17] crane giving me a concussion because i
[1:17:19] was choking him out i didn't know that
[1:17:21] choking wasn't allowed in wrestling and
[1:17:23] i was choking him out nathan had worn
[1:17:24] him out and then he took me on and i was
[1:17:26] winning and i was choking him out and he
[1:17:28] he got up and he slammed my head seven
[1:17:30] times into the floor and gave me a
[1:17:32] concussion right that was about 10
[1:17:34] minutes of wrestling and we were
[1:17:35] absolutely gassed and concussed
[1:17:37] right you don't last long with wrestling
[1:17:40] wrestling is full body workout
[1:17:42] everything is straining and grunting and
[1:17:45] shoving and pushing because you're
[1:17:46] looking for that little bit of advantage
[1:17:49] and it's constantly locked on you'll see
[1:17:52] them if you ever watch olympic wrestling
[1:17:53] what do they do they get in and they
[1:17:54] lock in and they're on arms and they're
[1:17:56] shifting this way and that and
[1:17:57] everything they're looking for an
[1:17:58] advantage and so with wrestling you
[1:18:00] don't get to sit back it's not like
[1:18:01] boxing you can kind of sit back and kind
[1:18:03] of watch the guy for a bit it's constant
[1:18:05] actions constant movement it's constant
[1:18:06] strain most people can't last 10 minutes
[1:18:09] it says jacob wrestled with a man until
[1:18:12] the breaking now remember we went from
[1:18:14] jacob talking
[1:18:15] to jacob praying he's beyond praying now
[1:18:18] folks he's wrestling
[1:18:20] he's wrestling right he's beyond
[1:18:22] desperation now he is fighting for
[1:18:24] something that he doesn't have right
[1:18:26] this is how far he's gone he's not just
[1:18:28] praying now he is in physical mortal
[1:18:30] combat if we could put it that way amen
[1:18:33] what is it he's not trying to beat this
[1:18:35] guy
[1:18:36] he's trying to keep this guy
[1:18:38] because he knows he realizes who he's
[1:18:40] fighting with
[1:18:41] he realizes at some point who is funny
[1:18:42] with and so he's not fighting to win
[1:18:44] he's fighting to hold him
[1:18:46] and keep him from going brother brahm
[1:18:48] said this he says jacob cried like never
[1:18:50] before
[1:18:51] desperately he called until he got a
[1:18:53] hold of god
[1:18:55] you've got to get a hold of god
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:58] and when he did he wrestled not for 15
[1:19:01] minutes he wrestled to keep him in his
[1:19:04] soul all night long and still he knew he
[1:19:08] didn't have the blessing
[1:19:11] he fought all night
[1:19:12] and he knew that he still didn't have
[1:19:14] the blessing
[1:19:15] sometimes we think because we struggle
[1:19:17] we have the blessing brother brown says
[1:19:19] he knew he didn't have the blessing even
[1:19:21] after struggling all night he says but
[1:19:24] he was able to hold on until the
[1:19:25] blessing come he wrestled desperately
[1:19:28] until the blessing come
[1:19:30] until god
[1:19:31] came on the scene amen
[1:19:34] jacob fought like a man possessed
[1:19:36] this is not a man fighting for his life
[1:19:38] this was a man fighting for the reality
[1:19:40] of god in his life amen he had all the
[1:19:42] blessings he had all the all the
[1:19:44] physical realities we could expect he
[1:19:46] had wealth he had family he had all of
[1:19:48] these different things all the things
[1:19:49] that they look for is a blessing from
[1:19:50] god back then amen but he was fighting
[1:19:52] for something that would change his
[1:19:54] situation now
[1:19:55] right
[1:19:56] now watch how god does it
[1:19:58] because what jacob already had the
[1:19:59] promise and he already had the blessing
[1:20:01] it was already given to him but he
[1:20:03] wasn't convinced of it and that makes
[1:20:05] all the difference doesn't it we have
[1:20:06] all of the all of the blessings in here
[1:20:09] but if you're not convinced of it then
[1:20:12] what happens you're going to be fighting
[1:20:13] all your life aren't you trying to do it
[1:20:15] your way instead of resting on what god
[1:20:17] has said amen but look what happens and
[1:20:19] this is verse 25 it says when he saw
[1:20:21] that he prevailed not against him so
[1:20:22] that's the angel of the lord
[1:20:24] didn't prevail against him he touched
[1:20:26] the hollow of his thigh and the hollow
[1:20:28] of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[1:20:30] wrestled with them so jacob comes into
[1:20:32] this battle as an able-bodied man he's
[1:20:34] strong he's fit he knows what he's doing
[1:20:36] he's got the strength he's got the
[1:20:38] endurance to hold on for this he's a
[1:20:40] he's a pretty uh a fit guy we would say
[1:20:42] man and listen in this one in this
[1:20:45] wrestling match god took every single
[1:20:46] bit of that away from him
[1:20:48] when he was done this wrestling match he
[1:20:50] had none of the able-bodied fitness that
[1:20:52] he had when he walked in amen god took
[1:20:54] every bit that allowed him to strive and
[1:20:56] strain and struggle in life he took
[1:20:58] every bit away of it when he touched him
[1:21:00] on his thigh and what he did was he
[1:21:01] knocked his hip out a joint
[1:21:03] you can't wrestle with your hip out of
[1:21:04] joint because it won't support you
[1:21:06] you're a one-legged man trying to
[1:21:07] wrestle a two-legged man guess what that
[1:21:09] doesn't work does it it's never gonna
[1:21:11] work amen
[1:21:12] why you can't beat god
[1:21:14] you can't beat them
[1:21:16] but you can prevail
[1:21:18] you can't beat them but you can prevail
[1:21:19] that means you can hold on long enough
[1:21:20] to get what you're looking for amen amen
[1:21:23] what happened after this jacob he starts
[1:21:25] and he's all struggling
[1:21:27] right
[1:21:28] come up brother kingsley
[1:21:31] he's struggling and he's striving right
[1:21:33] put your hands on me gently and he's got
[1:21:35] this come on he's like this right
[1:21:38] now watch when that hip goes out now
[1:21:40] brother i got nothing i got nothing
[1:21:43] right what is it he can't do anything so
[1:21:45] what's he doing come back brother
[1:21:46] kingsley
[1:21:47] and hold on so what's he doing now
[1:21:49] instead of trying to manipulate what's
[1:21:51] he doing now he's clinging isn't he
[1:21:53] because that's all he's got he's got one
[1:21:55] leg like this and he's holding on to
[1:21:56] that man and that man's trying to get
[1:21:57] away
[1:21:59] and jacob won't let him what is it he
[1:22:01] got to the place where he's not fighting
[1:22:02] now he's not trying to overpower what's
[1:22:04] he doing he's clinging on for dear life
[1:22:07] because that's all he's got left he's
[1:22:08] got no strength he's got no power he's
[1:22:10] got no strength he's got no moves
[1:22:13] he's got nothing left except to hold on
[1:22:15] that's all he's looking for is to hold
[1:22:17] on until he gets the blessing that he's
[1:22:19] looking for amen
[1:22:21] when he couldn't fight that's when he
[1:22:22] started clinging wasn't it amen that's
[1:22:24] all god ever wanted
[1:22:26] that's all god ever wanted was jacob
[1:22:29] trust me hold on to me get to the point
[1:22:31] where it's not you but it's me
[1:22:34] and then get to the point where you
[1:22:35] can't do it in the first place you
[1:22:37] realize it and let me do the work in you
[1:22:40] right cling that's all he's looking for
[1:22:42] friends is for us to cling
[1:22:46] oh man what is it cling to his word
[1:22:48] cling to his direction cling to the
[1:22:50] blood cling to the cross and then cling
[1:22:52] to the promise cling to the commitment
[1:22:54] cling to the covenant that he gave each
[1:22:56] and every one of us
[1:22:58] why otherwise he's got to do what he did
[1:22:59] to jacob
[1:23:01] he's got to touch your life
[1:23:03] he's going to touch your thighs so you
[1:23:04] can't walk
[1:23:05] so you have no moves left
[1:23:07] right so you've got nothing left and
[1:23:08] you're sitting there and all you're left
[1:23:10] with is sitting in a wheelchair saying
[1:23:11] god what do i do now
[1:23:13] because that's where jacob would have
[1:23:14] been if he was in the modern uh medicine
[1:23:16] wouldn't it
[1:23:17] he'd be in a wheelchair are you walking
[1:23:19] with crutches the rest of his life
[1:23:22] what is it
[1:23:24] he sets you up to fall so that all
[1:23:25] you're left to is clinging for him
[1:23:27] right that's all he's doing setting you
[1:23:29] up to say listen you got to trust me
[1:23:30] first before we move any further jacob
[1:23:33] you've got to come to a place where
[1:23:34] you'll trust me because you can't do
[1:23:35] anything right
[1:23:37] what is it he's not you're not going to
[1:23:39] let him get away until you get what he
[1:23:40] promised you what is it is it money
[1:23:43] it's not money is it because he's
[1:23:45] already got money it's not blessings
[1:23:46] what is it it's assurance right it's
[1:23:49] blessed assurance was what brother
[1:23:50] branham calls it where you can sit back
[1:23:52] and you can have what you can have rest
[1:23:53] you can have peace because you have a
[1:23:55] confirmation in your soul that you have
[1:23:57] a reality with god now it's not just
[1:24:00] words on a page it's just not a message
[1:24:01] that was given by a prophet in 1963 what
[1:24:04] is it you have a reality of that in your
[1:24:06] life amen
[1:24:08] we've got too many words around the
[1:24:09] message
[1:24:10] we can quote them all day long but how
[1:24:13] many have a reality of god how many have
[1:24:14] gotten to the point where god has
[1:24:16] knocked the pins out from under him and
[1:24:17] they've clung to him and realized that
[1:24:19] he is our portion he is our strength and
[1:24:21] then he is the one that's doing this
[1:24:23] now look
[1:24:24] this is the angel of the lord talking to
[1:24:26] him now he says and he said let me go
[1:24:28] for the day breaketh and he said i will
[1:24:31] not let thee go except thou bless me
[1:24:34] god's already blessed them what's he
[1:24:36] talking about god's already said
[1:24:38] everything he's going to do he's got the
[1:24:39] promise he's had multiple dreams he's
[1:24:41] had god come down and talk to him he
[1:24:43] said god guide him he's had everything
[1:24:44] but what is it he doesn't have a
[1:24:46] revelation of it he doesn't have a rest
[1:24:48] behind it he doesn't have a confirmation
[1:24:50] in himself that god's going to do it
[1:24:51] it's still just words to him and he says
[1:24:53] i won't let you go until you bless me
[1:24:56] what until you make this a reality
[1:24:59] brother brown said it this way he says
[1:25:01] after jacob have wrestled all night
[1:25:03] instead of trying to war away that man
[1:25:05] jacob held on to him he says i oh i wish
[1:25:08] we had about a half hour on that how
[1:25:09] that wrestling prince he was able to
[1:25:11] hold on until he got what he would after
[1:25:14] he held until it took all night but he
[1:25:18] stayed there
[1:25:19] he wanted to be absolutely convinced and
[1:25:23] when he stayed until god changed his
[1:25:25] walking he was convinced
[1:25:28] that's the trouble of it today we don't
[1:25:30] stay long enough till we get our walking
[1:25:33] convinced we don't walk like christians
[1:25:36] if we stay long enough with him he will
[1:25:38] make you walk different
[1:25:40] talk different
[1:25:41] live different act different sleep
[1:25:44] different
[1:25:46] be different
[1:25:47] i want to focus on sleep differently
[1:25:51] because what when is it that we stop and
[1:25:53] we start thinking about things
[1:25:55] when we lay our heads down isn't it and
[1:25:57] we lay in bed and the question is are we
[1:25:59] sitting there and wondering and worrying
[1:26:01] and trying to manipulate this and i
[1:26:03] don't mean manipulate bad i mean try and
[1:26:05] work things out in our head how are we
[1:26:07] going to get the money to do this how am
[1:26:09] i going to get here how am i going to do
[1:26:11] this how am i going to do that and we
[1:26:12] sit there and our minds just tumbling
[1:26:14] over and over and over again trying to
[1:26:16] make all the pieces aligned to where we
[1:26:18] have a perfect picture in our mind and
[1:26:20] everything works out
[1:26:21] but that's not our job
[1:26:23] that's not our job to work it out our
[1:26:25] job is to walk in faith and it's up to
[1:26:27] god to work it out that's why he says
[1:26:29] you will sleep different because of
[1:26:30] what's keeping you up at night is
[1:26:32] worrying concerned then you are lacking
[1:26:34] a revelation that god has already
[1:26:36] committed to what taking you all the way
[1:26:38] through whatever that need is
[1:26:40] whatever that need is it can be money
[1:26:43] it's okay to have needs for money and
[1:26:44] it's okay to go to god for money it can
[1:26:46] be your job it can be your career it can
[1:26:48] be your health it can be a spouse it can
[1:26:50] be your children it can be your church
[1:26:51] all of these things
[1:26:53] right we're living on this earth we've
[1:26:54] got carnal needs amen but there's got to
[1:26:56] come a spiritual satisfaction a
[1:26:58] spiritual rest a spiritual confirmation
[1:27:00] that will allow us to move through those
[1:27:02] things with faith that god is with us
[1:27:04] amen
[1:27:06] he says and the reason
[1:27:08] and the reason is
[1:27:10] we don't stay long enough
[1:27:12] we don't hold on jacob held on he said
[1:27:15] let me loose i've got to go he said i'm
[1:27:16] not going to leave you until i'm
[1:27:18] thoroughly convinced amen then when you
[1:27:21] take a promise of god and hold on to
[1:27:23] that don't let him loose just stay there
[1:27:26] until you see god come on the scene and
[1:27:30] then you're convinced
[1:27:33] another place he says and jacob rather
[1:27:35] in desperation he says i know i field
[1:27:36] you you're here with me but i'm not
[1:27:39] going to let you go somebody sees it's
[1:27:41] fine the first little sensation they get
[1:27:43] up and jump up and down run up the
[1:27:44] island say i got it i got it i got it he
[1:27:47] says uh-uh no
[1:27:49] oh jacob stayed there until something
[1:27:51] happened that made him walk different
[1:27:54] made him a different person because that
[1:27:57] he stayed until that happened and he was
[1:28:00] able the bible said he held until he
[1:28:02] prevailed how can a man prevail over god
[1:28:05] he says but you can do it you can do it
[1:28:07] a man can prevail over god
[1:28:10] it reminds me of when my boys want to
[1:28:12] wrestle
[1:28:14] and they prevail over me
[1:28:17] right what is it you let them work and
[1:28:19] work and work
[1:28:21] and then you give them an opportunity to
[1:28:23] take you down to score a goal whatever
[1:28:25] the case may be that you're doing with
[1:28:26] them right is you're looking to see will
[1:28:28] they put in the time and effort or will
[1:28:30] they just give up and say i've tried
[1:28:31] hard enough right brother baby's not
[1:28:33] saying we can beat god here he's saying
[1:28:35] you can prevail you can get god to give
[1:28:37] you what you need but it's on the basis
[1:28:39] of you staying there and showing that
[1:28:41] you're as committed to getting that
[1:28:42] result as he is and wanting to give it
[1:28:45] to you amen he's looking for somebody
[1:28:47] that will do what say i will not let you
[1:28:49] go
[1:28:50] i'm not going out of this place i'm not
[1:28:53] going out of my room i'm not going out
[1:28:54] of whatever i'm doing until you give me
[1:28:57] the answer that i'm looking for that i
[1:28:58] need an arrest and an assurance in my
[1:29:00] life amen
[1:29:02] amen you can prevail
[1:29:04] you can prevail the way he did jacob
[1:29:06] didn't that's by clinging and clinging
[1:29:08] and clinging and clinging until your
[1:29:10] hands are wrapped so tight in his
[1:29:12] clothes that they can't even be broken
[1:29:14] and then the scripture says they used to
[1:29:16] fight until their sword claimed to their
[1:29:18] hand you know what that meant it meant
[1:29:20] that their their fingers were so rigid
[1:29:21] around that sword that you couldn't pry
[1:29:23] it out for love nor money that's how
[1:29:25] hard they were holding to that sword
[1:29:26] because it was their life you lost the
[1:29:28] sword you lost your life right you had
[1:29:29] no way to defend you that's the way he's
[1:29:30] looking for somebody that'll grab onto
[1:29:32] him and cling until you can't take your
[1:29:34] hands away until he gives you what
[1:29:35] you're looking for and then you can pull
[1:29:37] away amen what is it
[1:29:39] we're not looking for an experience
[1:29:41] we're looking for a reality amen brother
[1:29:43] brahms talking about what something that
[1:29:44] changes your life
[1:29:47] your nature
[1:29:48] your mind
[1:29:50] your peace your rest your sleep this is
[1:29:52] something that has an effect amen it's
[1:29:54] not just something in your mind but it's
[1:29:55] something that actually steps into your
[1:29:57] actual body into your life and it makes
[1:29:59] a change
[1:30:00] that's what jacob was lacking there
[1:30:02] brother brown says this he says we could
[1:30:04] if we could just take a hold of god's
[1:30:05] agent god's agent then was elijah he
[1:30:08] says and god's agent today is the holy
[1:30:10] spirit hold on to it when you ever come
[1:30:13] in contact and you feel the holy spirit
[1:30:15] on you then hold on to it i'll not leave
[1:30:18] you
[1:30:19] stay with it like jacob did when he
[1:30:21] wrestled with the angel
[1:30:24] i'm going to hold on till you bless me
[1:30:25] and give me the things that i'm desiring
[1:30:27] he says wouldn't it be a wonderful
[1:30:28] revival break out and all up and down
[1:30:30] the coast here if the people that's
[1:30:32] right here tonight and those that are
[1:30:33] listening in on the air would take that
[1:30:35] attitude towards the holy spirit tonight
[1:30:37] i'm going to stay with you until i find
[1:30:40] out the things that i want to know
[1:30:42] amen
[1:30:43] you can't beat them but you can play you
[1:30:45] can cling to them amen you can be
[1:30:46] unshakable in your approach that's what
[1:30:48] he's saying he says you hold on until
[1:30:49] you get what you're looking for now the
[1:30:51] way life is today we can't go for days
[1:30:53] on end can we we can't stay in our
[1:30:55] prayer closet for days on end we've got
[1:30:56] too many things going on if you've got a
[1:30:58] family there's no way you can do it
[1:30:59] you've got responsibilities but you can
[1:31:01] say lord i'm coming to you in prayer
[1:31:03] lord i'm putting myself before you i'm
[1:31:04] keeping my life sanctified and i'm going
[1:31:06] and i'm spending my time with you until
[1:31:08] you show me what i'm looking for amen
[1:31:10] until you give me a reality of what i'm
[1:31:12] asking for amen
[1:31:15] listen to the angel's response this is
[1:31:16] the angel of the lord now
[1:31:19] and he said unto him what is thy name
[1:31:20] and he said jacob and he said thy name
[1:31:23] shall be no more called jacob but israel
[1:31:26] for as a prince hast thou power with god
[1:31:30] and with men
[1:31:33] and hast prevailed there's a real
[1:31:36] difference in that name isn't there we
[1:31:37] went from jacob the manipulator deceiver
[1:31:39] the guy that does shortcuts all these
[1:31:41] different things and now he says what
[1:31:43] your name is israel that means what a
[1:31:45] prince having power with god and men
[1:31:48] it means also fighter of god and one who
[1:31:50] contends with god
[1:31:52] and not contends against him but
[1:31:54] contends what to get what god has
[1:31:56] promised him amen but look jacob didn't
[1:31:58] just get a name change
[1:32:01] i sometimes will settle for something
[1:32:04] he didn't settle for just a name change
[1:32:06] right he settled for what a nature
[1:32:07] change because we see after this that
[1:32:09] jacob never struggles in this area again
[1:32:11] do we right he goes back and he faces
[1:32:13] esau and we'll talk about that in a
[1:32:15] little bit but jacob's nature has
[1:32:17] changed now where he comes out a
[1:32:18] different man than he walked in
[1:32:20] amen he comes out a man having power
[1:32:22] with god and men having gone in a
[1:32:24] manipulator and a deceiver listen if he
[1:32:27] could do that for him he can do it for
[1:32:28] all of us can't he amen he didn't even
[1:32:30] have the holy ghost
[1:32:33] he didn't even have the holy ghost
[1:32:35] what there's a better thing that came to
[1:32:36] us paul said right they all they never
[1:32:39] received the fullness of the promise but
[1:32:40] we received the fullness of the problem
[1:32:41] so the question is what is it that can
[1:32:43] hold us back what is it that says you
[1:32:45] can't be this or you can't be that or
[1:32:47] you can't do this or you can't do that
[1:32:48] if it's in the word then it's all given
[1:32:50] to us amen we have every redemptive
[1:32:52] promise that christ died for on calvary
[1:32:54] that belongs to us without question it
[1:32:56] is ours because we are his bride and he
[1:32:58] died for us amen so there's nothing that
[1:33:00] can hold us back
[1:33:03] brother braham says
[1:33:04] what the church needs to do is to do
[1:33:06] like jacob pray till you get a v-day
[1:33:10] and right he said jacob had a wrestling
[1:33:12] party
[1:33:13] he wrestled all night long with the lord
[1:33:15] but he said i'm just not going to let
[1:33:17] you go until i get this victory and then
[1:33:19] about daylight one morning he had a
[1:33:21] v-day
[1:33:22] he didn't walk the same anymore he says
[1:33:24] on this side
[1:33:26] he was a great big before the battle
[1:33:28] before the wrestling he was a great big
[1:33:31] strong
[1:33:32] okay everything's sounding good great
[1:33:34] big strong
[1:33:35] fearful
[1:33:36] church member
[1:33:38] looked great
[1:33:39] had all the skill in the world had all
[1:33:41] the strength in the world all the
[1:33:42] fitness in the world he says a great big
[1:33:44] strong fearful church member
[1:33:49] but on the other side he was a little
[1:33:52] limping
[1:33:53] pre prince
[1:33:54] a little limping prince with enough
[1:33:57] courage to fight the whole army
[1:34:01] what are we looking for most times
[1:34:03] you look and you say i want to be a
[1:34:05] great warrior great warrior s for god
[1:34:10] strong
[1:34:13] like the mouse right that fell into the
[1:34:15] vat of wine
[1:34:16] where's that devil
[1:34:19] that's not what jacob looked like
[1:34:21] when he finished when he was ready to
[1:34:23] fight when he was ready to take the
[1:34:24] promise
[1:34:26] this is what victory looked like okay
[1:34:30] that's what victory looks like with god
[1:34:34] right where's the victory in that
[1:34:35] he knows who he is
[1:34:37] he knows god's with him he knows the
[1:34:39] promises of reality in his life it
[1:34:41] doesn't look very good
[1:34:43] right doesn't look very impressive when
[1:34:44] jacob's coming at you but jacob's not
[1:34:46] afraid brother brown says what he's a
[1:34:48] limping prince with enough courage to
[1:34:49] fight the whole army victory looks like
[1:34:51] a limp a lot of times amen paul had it
[1:34:54] remember paul had a thorn in his flesh
[1:34:56] that never went away paul wasn't a great
[1:34:58] speaker prophet of the age and he was a
[1:35:00] bad speaker right victory looks really
[1:35:03] different than what we sometimes project
[1:35:04] it to be i think
[1:35:06] what is it has jacob's situation changed
[1:35:10] jacob's going in and he says lord change
[1:35:12] the situation and what happens on the
[1:35:13] other side of the wrestling match
[1:35:15] jacob changes situation hasn't changed
[1:35:17] at all but jacob's changed a whole lot
[1:35:19] hasn't he right what are we doing so
[1:35:21] often as we're saying lord change the
[1:35:23] situation and he's saying situations of
[1:35:26] me
[1:35:27] he says you need the change situation
[1:35:29] doesn't need to be changed you need to
[1:35:30] be changed what you need a greater
[1:35:32] revelation of the love of god and the
[1:35:34] life of god within you you need a
[1:35:35] greater peace a greater rest you need a
[1:35:37] greater strength you need to get this
[1:35:38] fear taken out of you
[1:35:40] right so i'm putting the situation there
[1:35:42] to draw what's in you so that you'll say
[1:35:44] well lord give me what i need then
[1:35:46] because i don't have enough to go
[1:35:47] through it i don't have the answer
[1:35:49] anymore i've reached my tipping point
[1:35:51] and if we go any further i'm going to
[1:35:53] fall off the cliff so lord i need you
[1:35:55] and we start to wrestle and cling don't
[1:35:57] we
[1:35:58] what until you know beyond a shadow of a
[1:35:59] doubt that what he has said is true and
[1:36:01] it's for you
[1:36:02] right i believe this is true for brother
[1:36:04] ellie no problem i'll believe all day
[1:36:06] long brother you pick it i'll believe it
[1:36:08] for you when it comes to me what happens
[1:36:12] oh
[1:36:13] oh
[1:36:15] maybe
[1:36:17] right what is it we've got all sorts of
[1:36:18] faith for brother ellie
[1:36:20] right
[1:36:22] and then i've got none for brother
[1:36:23] jonathan
[1:36:24] why because i need a greater revelation
[1:36:26] i need a i don't need an experience with
[1:36:28] god i need a change right that's what
[1:36:31] i'm looking for and this is from glory
[1:36:32] to glory friends it never stops brother
[1:36:34] gerald has assured me many times he's
[1:36:36] still changing and growing so that means
[1:36:38] we're going to keep growing and changing
[1:36:39] until we get to the ending and we're
[1:36:40] looking for what an experience of our
[1:36:42] changing god not just an experience of
[1:36:44] the holy spirit guess what the rain
[1:36:46] falls on the just and the unjust right
[1:36:47] it falls on the weed and the weeds at
[1:36:49] the same time so we can say i've had all
[1:36:51] of these great experiences and i've had
[1:36:53] all these great dreams and i've got all
[1:36:54] these great gifts and god's used me for
[1:36:56] a million things and guess what
[1:36:57] scripture says at the end they'll have
[1:36:58] all of that and he'll say depart from me
[1:37:00] you that work iniquity i never knew you
[1:37:02] experiences are just that they help us
[1:37:04] along the way but they are not the way
[1:37:06] right they help us but they're not it
[1:37:08] right they're gifts if we can look at
[1:37:10] that way but they're not the giver and
[1:37:12] jacob's coming to the place where he
[1:37:13] says you're giving me the gifts now i
[1:37:15] need the giver right
[1:37:16] you give me the blessings of god but now
[1:37:18] i want the god of the blessings
[1:37:21] brother brown says this jacob stayed all
[1:37:23] night i'm sorry some of these are
[1:37:24] repetitive but he hits it from different
[1:37:25] angles and i wanted to drive it in jacob
[1:37:27] stayed all night one night wrestling
[1:37:29] that wrestling prince he wrestled all
[1:37:30] night he had been dodging esau here and
[1:37:32] there what have you been dodging
[1:37:35] he was scared to death of him and he
[1:37:37] heard esau was coming he put his wife
[1:37:39] across the brook went over the other
[1:37:41] side and knelt down you know god come
[1:37:43] down and got a hold of jacob and they
[1:37:44] wrestled all night so he wasn't
[1:37:46] completely convinced to start with but
[1:37:48] by the time god got through with him he
[1:37:50] was convinced
[1:37:51] yes he stayed and held on until he was
[1:37:54] convinced that it was god brother he
[1:37:56] wasn't scared of esau then crossed the
[1:37:58] river and he was weak and limping the
[1:38:01] worse that he could be in looked like
[1:38:04] the worse that he could be and look like
[1:38:06] looking on the outside he was the
[1:38:08] weakest he ever was he had been crippled
[1:38:11] and everything
[1:38:12] i'm going to face isa
[1:38:14] how with a limp and a new name
[1:38:17] but esau said to him
[1:38:19] will you let me send an army along to
[1:38:21] help you he said i don't even need the
[1:38:23] help why he was convinced that the god
[1:38:25] that he had a hold of could take care of
[1:38:26] him he says hallelujah
[1:38:29] if people would just do that you can be
[1:38:32] convinced that the god that takes a hold
[1:38:35] of you shakes your heart makes you a new
[1:38:37] creature in christ jesus let sickness
[1:38:39] death or anything else come along you're
[1:38:42] convinced that he can take good care of
[1:38:45] you
[1:38:46] so the question is what are you
[1:38:47] convinced of this morning
[1:38:49] and the situations we face in life and
[1:38:51] the struggles and the trials
[1:38:53] are you convinced that he has provided
[1:38:55] the answer
[1:38:56] amen not only for the situation but for
[1:38:58] you to go through the situation amen
[1:39:00] we're not meant to struggle and strive
[1:39:02] for these things stress is the greatest
[1:39:03] killer today
[1:39:05] why
[1:39:06] because people don't have anything to
[1:39:07] rest on
[1:39:09] we heard it all through the song
[1:39:10] services excellent service brother ralph
[1:39:12] right a rock somebody to cling to
[1:39:15] right they've got to have something that
[1:39:17] they can hold to to go through these
[1:39:18] things amen brother branham says you've
[1:39:20] got to stay till you're convinced he
[1:39:22] said don't stay till you feel something
[1:39:24] he said that about the holy ghost
[1:39:25] remember he said the holy ghost what
[1:39:26] happens people get down to pray the
[1:39:28] presence of the holy spirit drops down
[1:39:29] they say i got it i got i got it he says
[1:39:31] no no stay there till your change he
[1:39:33] didn't say stay till you feel something
[1:39:35] he said stay till you are something
[1:39:38] right you've got to be what you're
[1:39:39] believing for and god's got to do that
[1:39:41] you can't do it yourself and then stay
[1:39:43] until you're changed till your nature's
[1:39:44] been changed till your mind's been
[1:39:46] changed until your opinion's been
[1:39:47] changed and he is the one that's shining
[1:39:49] clearly through you amen
[1:39:51] amen you can't be just convinced up here
[1:39:53] like i said i'm convinced up here for
[1:39:54] brother ellie perfectly well
[1:39:56] right brother ellie you're you're fully
[1:39:58] blessed brother i'll believe anything
[1:39:59] you want me to believe for you
[1:40:00] it's an amazing place to be in is being
[1:40:02] having faith for somebody else but we've
[1:40:04] got to have it for ourselves amen i
[1:40:06] can't get brother ellie in the rapture
[1:40:08] right
[1:40:10] i can pray for him and have faith for
[1:40:11] him but that's not going to do it amen
[1:40:12] i've got to have something in me that's
[1:40:13] going to take me in the rapture amen
[1:40:15] we've got to believe it for ourselves
[1:40:17] and for those that are with us amen
[1:40:19] brother baby says this he says hey you
[1:40:20] want a spiritual name tonight
[1:40:22] amen are you a deceiver a manipulator
[1:40:25] are you weak
[1:40:27] paul was weak
[1:40:29] do you know paul was weak
[1:40:31] paul was weak right are you weak are you
[1:40:33] weak in an area that's an easy one isn't
[1:40:35] it are you weak in an area right he says
[1:40:37] hey you want a spiritual name tonight
[1:40:39] you want a different name for what
[1:40:40] you're struggling with
[1:40:42] just get a hold of the holy spirit and
[1:40:44] say lord i'm not going to leave this
[1:40:45] tabernacle till you bless me and things
[1:40:48] will look different when you leave
[1:40:49] you'll be just as determined as jacob
[1:40:51] was and you'll get a blessing amen
[1:40:56] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[1:40:58] pray thee thy name and he said wherefore
[1:41:00] is it that thou dost ask after my name
[1:41:03] and he blessed him there and jacob
[1:41:05] called the name of the place pineal for
[1:41:07] i have seen god face to face and my life
[1:41:10] is preserved amen when a believer comes
[1:41:12] into the presence of god it's
[1:41:14] life-preserving right remember if
[1:41:16] somebody walked into the holiest of
[1:41:17] holies and they were not supposed to be
[1:41:19] there what happened
[1:41:20] instant death
[1:41:21] right but if you walked in because you
[1:41:23] were allowed to be there what was it it
[1:41:25] was life it was forgiveness it was an
[1:41:27] atonement it was grace it was mercy it
[1:41:29] was everything that you were looking for
[1:41:30] wasn't it why you're invited in there it
[1:41:34] says and he passed over penul
[1:41:36] and as he passed over penul the sun rose
[1:41:38] upon him and he halted upon his thigh
[1:41:41] like i said that limp is what power with
[1:41:43] god looks like remember brother brown
[1:41:45] said humility is power with god
[1:41:47] right he got real humble didn't he he
[1:41:49] went from i've got everything to i have
[1:41:51] nothing and without you i'm going to
[1:41:52] lose the last thing i have which is my
[1:41:54] life that's the place that jacob got to
[1:41:56] amen and he walks out of this and he's
[1:41:58] convinced
[1:41:59] that what it's going to be real now
[1:42:02] brother bram says this notice after the
[1:42:04] battle was over melchizedek served his
[1:42:06] victorious child communion
[1:42:08] think of that part of himself now we
[1:42:11] want to see here and type here is in
[1:42:13] view the communion after the battle he
[1:42:15] gave of himself because the communion is
[1:42:17] part of christ now he's talking about
[1:42:19] when abraham returned from the battle of
[1:42:20] the kings remember
[1:42:22] and after the struggle is over
[1:42:26] after you've done got yourself whipped
[1:42:28] out
[1:42:30] then is when you partake of christ and
[1:42:33] become a part of this being he says you
[1:42:35] get it jacob wrestled all night and
[1:42:37] wouldn't turn him loose till he blessed
[1:42:38] him that's right he battled for life
[1:42:42] that's what we're looking for is life
[1:42:44] and more abundantly amen more and more
[1:42:46] and more of christ than me that's we're
[1:42:48] looking for in every aspect of our life
[1:42:50] but he's going to do what he's going to
[1:42:51] bring us to a time where it gets serious
[1:42:54] where there's going to be desperation
[1:42:55] where we see that the things are coming
[1:42:57] to a point and a decision has to be made
[1:42:59] and we can either die or we can move on
[1:43:01] right and we've got to give up before we
[1:43:03] can move on is really what's going to
[1:43:04] happen
[1:43:05] he says battle for life and after the
[1:43:07] battle is over then god gives you of
[1:43:09] himself he says that is his true
[1:43:11] communion the little bread and wafer
[1:43:12] just represents it then he says you
[1:43:15] shouldn't take it unless you wrestled it
[1:43:17] out and become a part of god
[1:43:20] amen i want to ask you have you seen the
[1:43:23] blessings of god in your life
[1:43:25] because it's a beautiful thing isn't it
[1:43:27] they're amazing when you have these
[1:43:28] supernatural experiences i've seen you
[1:43:31] know brother braham talks about that
[1:43:32] milky cloud i've seen that
[1:43:34] and then i've testified of having the
[1:43:35] holy spirit drop down in my car right
[1:43:37] there at holy ghost corner as we call it
[1:43:39] on cherry lane now right i've seen god
[1:43:42] heal i've seen god deliver i've seen god
[1:43:45] work miracles i've seen god give visions
[1:43:47] and dreams i've seen all of these things
[1:43:49] and they're amazing things
[1:43:50] but they're just blessings
[1:43:52] right it's not god it's just a what it's
[1:43:55] an outpouring of god right it's god's
[1:43:57] showing things it's god helping us along
[1:43:59] the way but it's not god himself it's
[1:44:01] just a reflection of those things amen
[1:44:03] and those things those experiences i'm
[1:44:04] talking about they're not what changed
[1:44:06] me into what i am today
[1:44:08] they have facilitated it they have made
[1:44:10] a path and they've made it easier but
[1:44:13] that is not what changes us like i said
[1:44:15] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:44:16] unjust you can sit in a holy
[1:44:18] ghost-filled service and say praise the
[1:44:19] lord and worship until your horse like
[1:44:21] we did this last weekend but if you
[1:44:23] don't have the god if you don't have the
[1:44:24] holy spirit that was falling in you
[1:44:26] rather than on you then what you're
[1:44:27] still lost
[1:44:28] right you've got to have something
[1:44:30] inside of you amen it's not the
[1:44:31] experience that changes me it's the god
[1:44:33] of the experience that i'm looking for
[1:44:35] every day amen
[1:44:37] why we can't cling to gifts we're
[1:44:38] talking about clinging we can't cling to
[1:44:40] gifts paul said they'll fail we can't
[1:44:42] clean the ministries they'll fail we
[1:44:44] can't clean the prophecy they'll fail
[1:44:46] right all of these things will fail you
[1:44:48] lift the man up he's going to fail every
[1:44:50] time you lift the ministry up it's going
[1:44:51] to fail right you lift a gift up you
[1:44:53] lift a blessing of god up and it'll
[1:44:55] always fail because it's not meant to be
[1:44:57] perfect in those things right because
[1:44:58] it's in imperfect vessels but what if we
[1:45:00] can cling to him now and hold on until
[1:45:03] he gives us what he's promised us mind
[1:45:05] you we're going for what he promised not
[1:45:08] what i promised we're going for what he
[1:45:09] promised so if we're holding to what he
[1:45:11] promised now then we've got something we
[1:45:13] can cling to because it's him we're
[1:45:14] going to amen now he may choose to bring
[1:45:16] it through a ministry he may choose to
[1:45:18] bring it through a brother he may choose
[1:45:19] to bring it through his sister whatever
[1:45:21] it may be but we're clinging until he
[1:45:22] gives us until we're satisfied that
[1:45:24] he'll do it amen
[1:45:26] brother brad says this he says god
[1:45:27] that's my prayer make me a christian
[1:45:30] lord if everything else fails make me a
[1:45:33] christian lord
[1:45:34] put something in me that's real knock at
[1:45:37] my heart lord tell me my short place and
[1:45:40] where i'm short at
[1:45:42] come in lord and open the doors of my
[1:45:44] own life
[1:45:45] open up my private life open my up my
[1:45:48] eyes open everything lord let me see you
[1:45:52] the love of god that shed abroad in our
[1:45:54] hearts by the holy ghost that's what i
[1:45:56] want
[1:45:58] he says that's what christ wants to do
[1:46:00] to this church
[1:46:03] not give you any more gifts you got too
[1:46:05] many of them now
[1:46:08] now this is 58 right he's still talking
[1:46:10] to pentecost in all in all likelihood
[1:46:13] but you'll see people chasing after the
[1:46:14] gifts all over again
[1:46:16] right brother bam says he's here
[1:46:18] right what are we looking for gifts for
[1:46:20] we've got the giver of the gifts now
[1:46:22] amen isaac's in the room with rebecca
[1:46:23] now right why are we talking to eliezer
[1:46:25] and the gifts no no let's move past it
[1:46:27] and let's spend our time with isaac
[1:46:29] himself he says what he wants to do is
[1:46:31] give you himself
[1:46:34] what is that he says love the love of
[1:46:36] god the abundant life in your heart that
[1:46:38] makes you love everybody and makes you
[1:46:41] love him till you can't rest
[1:46:44] that's i would love that
[1:46:47] i will say i'm not there yet
[1:46:49] right where i love everybody where my
[1:46:51] response is love regardless of what
[1:46:53] comes my way i'm looking for that i
[1:46:55] can't say that's in a full manifestation
[1:46:57] now in my life i believe i have the
[1:46:58] earnest of it i have the earnest of it i
[1:47:00] have no doubt of that but i'm looking
[1:47:02] for what a fullness now amen we're
[1:47:03] looking for god to do something greater
[1:47:05] than he's done so far to fill us more
[1:47:08] which means what
[1:47:09] us a little more too right let
[1:47:12] the carnal nature slide back a bit so
[1:47:13] that we can have more of this love that
[1:47:15] he's talking about and then i want to
[1:47:16] say this you can have every supernatural
[1:47:18] and spiritual experience that life has
[1:47:20] to offer and if you don't have the life
[1:47:22] itself it will do nothing for you
[1:47:24] amen we can sit here and we can have the
[1:47:26] holy spirit raining down we can have
[1:47:28] gifts moving we could have everything we
[1:47:30] could ever expect
[1:47:31] ever have dreams visions angels pill or
[1:47:34] fire you name it we can have it all in
[1:47:36] our midst but if we don't have him in
[1:47:37] our souls
[1:47:39] then it's not going to do us any good is
[1:47:40] it
[1:47:41] amen they're wonderful things and we
[1:47:42] praise god for them amen but i want to
[1:47:45] tell you don't settle for the blessings
[1:47:47] right because what's going to happen is
[1:47:48] you're going to get to the end and say
[1:47:50] the blessings aren't going to take me
[1:47:51] into heaven i was listening to a brother
[1:47:53] preach
[1:47:54] he was repeating the story brother
[1:47:55] branham had of that young sister
[1:47:57] and she was a christian a professing
[1:47:59] christian and there was another
[1:48:00] christian young lady and she always
[1:48:02] dressed real simple her hair was simple
[1:48:04] she had no makeup on she had simple
[1:48:05] clothes and this girl would make fun of
[1:48:07] her and say all these things about her
[1:48:09] and said you know what are you doing
[1:48:10] that for and you look horrible and
[1:48:12] you're only going to look more horrible
[1:48:13] and my pastor doesn't teach it and this
[1:48:15] and that the other thing and so that
[1:48:17] young lady went out and she got a uh
[1:48:19] an std
[1:48:21] right and she's dying on the hospital
[1:48:23] bed and they she was a sunday school
[1:48:25] teacher
[1:48:26] and what happened is they brought in the
[1:48:27] young children to see the angels take
[1:48:29] her away
[1:48:31] and what happened is she she she started
[1:48:34] what looking not in the mirror of
[1:48:35] herself but she started looking in the
[1:48:37] mirror of the word and she realized i
[1:48:39] have fallen and come short of the glory
[1:48:40] of god that she didn't have what that
[1:48:42] word was talking about and she said
[1:48:44] bring in that preacher that was telling
[1:48:46] me that i didn't need these things
[1:48:49] right
[1:48:49] and he came and said oh we'll give you a
[1:48:51] needle we'll calm you down she says no
[1:48:52] no no that's not going to help she said
[1:48:54] bring me that girl that i was making fun
[1:48:56] of all that time
[1:48:57] right and what happened she's in there
[1:48:58] and she's screaming and those little
[1:49:00] kids are looking at her their sunday
[1:49:01] school teacher right they think the
[1:49:03] angels are going to take her and she
[1:49:04] knows that she's going down not up
[1:49:06] right what is it the reality hits her
[1:49:08] and she gets desperate and realizes i
[1:49:10] don't have what i thought i had right
[1:49:12] it's too late at that point she's got
[1:49:14] nothing
[1:49:15] she's got nothing and she dies screaming
[1:49:18] why because she made fun of it right she
[1:49:20] was too happy to have the blessings
[1:49:22] without the giver of the blessings
[1:49:24] amen you gotta hope get a hold of god
[1:49:26] amen and you'll never be the same again
[1:49:28] brother brown says he there's this quote
[1:49:29] he says like a colored sister said one
[1:49:31] time in the meeting she said i want you
[1:49:33] all to know one thing said i'm not what
[1:49:35] i want to be
[1:49:36] right i'm not what i want to be
[1:49:38] i'm not what i ought to be but there's
[1:49:40] one thing sure i'm not what i used to be
[1:49:43] you want an evidence of the holy spirit
[1:49:44] it's that you're what nature has been
[1:49:47] changed right your desire is not for the
[1:49:49] things of the world jesus said if the
[1:49:51] man loved the things of the world then
[1:49:52] the love of god is not in it
[1:49:56] he says
[1:49:57] i'll tell you that's a good thing
[1:49:59] you know when you're passed from death
[1:50:01] into life when god takes a hold of you
[1:50:04] and hugs you
[1:50:05] kisses you makes you feel warm and
[1:50:07] welcome
[1:50:09] he says when god takes a hold of you and
[1:50:11] shakes you
[1:50:12] until your life changes
[1:50:14] and changes everything there is in you
[1:50:17] and makes you a new creature amen that's
[1:50:19] what we need
[1:50:21] is some lighted candles yes sir jacob
[1:50:24] didn't walk out of that wrestling match
[1:50:27] israel limped out
[1:50:29] amen
[1:50:30] and when he did he walked up to esau
[1:50:32] without fear
[1:50:33] right he was a changed man
[1:50:35] couldn't walk couldn't fight couldn't do
[1:50:37] anything but yet he was fearless in the
[1:50:38] face of what he thought was such a
[1:50:40] horrible situation and you know what he
[1:50:42] walks out and he's a prince having power
[1:50:44] with god and you know what happens when
[1:50:45] a prince having power with god walks
[1:50:47] into a situation
[1:50:48] what does he do he bows himself seven
[1:50:51] times
[1:50:53] to the situation
[1:50:55] why he's got nothing to prove
[1:50:58] he's convinced
[1:50:59] he's convinced god's with them
[1:51:02] he walks in with confidence
[1:51:04] not cockiness confidence and in that
[1:51:07] confidence what does it allow him to be
[1:51:09] humble and repentant he knew he did
[1:51:11] wrong he knew he did wrong to esau there
[1:51:13] was no covering it up now there's no
[1:51:15] pretending and he walked in and he bowed
[1:51:17] seven times as he drew closer and closer
[1:51:19] to esau and what happened was zisa
[1:51:21] received him
[1:51:22] and even offered him his men to help
[1:51:24] guard him on his way back that's why
[1:51:25] brother brown says and jacob says no no
[1:51:27] we've got to go slow otherwise the
[1:51:28] animals will they'll die out because
[1:51:30] we're pushing them too hard in these
[1:51:31] different things he says don't worry
[1:51:32] about it we'll be fine why is he saying
[1:51:34] that because god's with him and he's
[1:51:36] convinced of it now he's already seen
[1:51:38] the host of angels and that didn't
[1:51:39] convince him but when he spent a night
[1:51:41] with god and wrestled until he was
[1:51:42] changed now he knew that everything was
[1:51:44] going to be okay amen
[1:51:47] and what he knew the battle was won with
[1:51:48] esau that's why he could bow himself
[1:51:50] because he knew the battle was one
[1:51:52] wasn't him fighting it wasn't him that
[1:51:54] was going to change it it wasn't him
[1:51:55] that was going to make the deal what was
[1:51:56] it he humbled himself and let god take
[1:51:58] care of the situation we heard this the
[1:52:00] other day when brother gerald brother
[1:52:01] jail this is the quote that started me
[1:52:03] down this path
[1:52:04] he says through meekness
[1:52:06] through sweetness
[1:52:07] through the holy spirit that we conquer
[1:52:10] not some great mighty intellectual giant
[1:52:13] but he that can humble himself is the
[1:52:15] man who conquers
[1:52:18] the man who can be kicked around and
[1:52:20] still be a servant of christ
[1:52:23] that's the conqueror
[1:52:25] god help us amen
[1:52:27] we're going to close with one scripture
[1:52:29] hebrew six
[1:52:30] this is paul
[1:52:32] he says but beloved we are persuaded
[1:52:34] better things of you and things that
[1:52:36] accompany salvation
[1:52:38] we we accept the finished work of
[1:52:40] calvary
[1:52:41] right we even get the holy ghost and
[1:52:44] paul's saying there's more beyond that
[1:52:46] right we have what we are persuaded
[1:52:48] better things of you things that come
[1:52:50] with being a christian things that come
[1:52:52] with being a son of god things that come
[1:52:54] with being a daughter of god amen and
[1:52:56] though we thus speak for god is not
[1:52:58] unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:53:00] labor of love which ye have shown toward
[1:53:02] his name and that ye have ministered to
[1:53:04] the saints and do minister he says
[1:53:05] you're doing a lot of work and god is
[1:53:07] not the one that's uh he'll recognize it
[1:53:09] he recognizes it
[1:53:11] he says and we desire that every one of
[1:53:13] you to show the same diligence to the
[1:53:16] full assurance of hope unto the end keep
[1:53:20] pushing keep pressing is what he's
[1:53:21] saying don't rest on your laurels don't
[1:53:23] relax too much
[1:53:25] right keep pushing keep seeking god more
[1:53:27] and more in these different situations
[1:53:29] that we're in amen he says that ye be
[1:53:31] not slothful
[1:53:33] right don't be slack be focused be
[1:53:35] working be pressing be praying be
[1:53:38] pushing
[1:53:39] not to do it yourself but be pushing to
[1:53:41] do what get a hold of him that's where
[1:53:43] we want to be not slothful and followers
[1:53:46] of them that through faith and patience
[1:53:47] inherit the promises for when god made
[1:53:50] promise to abraham because he could
[1:53:51] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[1:53:54] saying surely i will bless them and
[1:53:56] multiplying i will multiply thee and so
[1:53:58] after he had patiently endured
[1:54:01] patiently endured
[1:54:03] do you endure when things are easy
[1:54:06] do you endure when things are going
[1:54:07] great
[1:54:08] it's real hard to endure when you have a
[1:54:10] great meal in front of you and it's all
[1:54:12] prepared and there's money in the bank
[1:54:13] and a house over here
[1:54:15] that's not endurance
[1:54:16] that's enjoyment right he says patiently
[1:54:20] endure there's going to be trouble
[1:54:22] struggles there's going to be trials
[1:54:23] there's going to be tribulations there's
[1:54:24] going to be difficulties aren't there he
[1:54:26] says but what after he had patiently
[1:54:28] endured he obtained the promise
[1:54:31] that wasn't a perfect walk of abraham
[1:54:32] we've said it many times right when you
[1:54:34] go to hebrews it says everything he did
[1:54:36] right but if you go read the story he
[1:54:37] did a lot of stuff wrong and only one
[1:54:39] thing right
[1:54:40] in the end he had faith that was what
[1:54:42] abraham did he obeyed god and he did and
[1:54:44] he had faith
[1:54:45] but he did a ton of mistakes in there i
[1:54:47] mean that's a that's a that's a big
[1:54:48] comfort to me he says for men verily
[1:54:51] swear by the greater and an o for
[1:54:53] confirmation is to them an end of all
[1:54:55] strife so he says men do it and they
[1:54:57] they sign a contract or they say i'm
[1:54:58] going to do that and that's the end of
[1:55:00] it he says but god wearing god willing
[1:55:02] more abundantly to show unto the heirs
[1:55:05] of promise
[1:55:07] the immutability of his counsel
[1:55:08] confirmed by an old what he says to
[1:55:10] those that have a promise from me
[1:55:12] he says what the immutability of his
[1:55:14] counsel god cannot change his mind
[1:55:17] god does not change his mind right it is
[1:55:19] perfect when he says it
[1:55:21] and when he commits to it then he's
[1:55:23] going to do it that's the immutability
[1:55:24] of his counsel there's no variance in it
[1:55:26] it doesn't change based on us and he
[1:55:28] never changes so we don't have to worry
[1:55:30] about that he confirmed it by note that
[1:55:32] by two immutable things
[1:55:34] so the two things are the immutability
[1:55:35] of his counsel and then that he swore by
[1:55:37] it swore by himself god doesn't change
[1:55:39] his counsel doesn't change
[1:55:40] that by two immutable things in which it
[1:55:42] was impossible for god to lie we might
[1:55:44] have a strong consolation who have fled
[1:55:48] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[1:55:51] before us
[1:55:52] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:55:55] soul both sure and steadfast and which
[1:55:58] entereth into that within
[1:56:01] the veil amen god bless you as we stand
[1:56:03] together amen
[1:56:05] he says what we have an anchor of the
[1:56:06] soul the question is to what are we
[1:56:08] anchored are we anchored to an
[1:56:09] experience or are we anchored to a
[1:56:11] reality if that experience doesn't bring
[1:56:13] a reality then it's something that's
[1:56:14] going to fail and then we want to take
[1:56:16] it all the way to reality amen
[1:56:19] what cling to god
[1:56:21] get to the point where you are convinced
[1:56:23] so brother brown keeps saying be
[1:56:24] convinced be convinced get a hold of god
[1:56:26] until you are convinced and you can move
[1:56:28] forward without fear
[1:56:30] right without shame
[1:56:32] without anything that's holding you back
[1:56:34] to be able to move forward with it and
[1:56:36] say what god you are my healer god you
[1:56:38] are my provider god you are my deliverer
[1:56:41] god you are my redeemer god you are my
[1:56:42] savior god you are my filler whatever it
[1:56:45] might be that we have need of what cling
[1:56:47] to him until he says
[1:56:49] i'll bless you all right i'm not letting
[1:56:51] you go until you bless me all right i'll
[1:56:53] bless you
[1:56:54] right out wait god right all he's
[1:56:57] looking for is a relationship
[1:56:58] all he's trying to do is get you close
[1:57:00] to him
[1:57:01] right all he wants is somebody that'll
[1:57:03] talk to him that'll rest on him that'll
[1:57:05] dwell with him somebody that'll put him
[1:57:07] first in those things and that's what
[1:57:08] happened is god stripped everything away
[1:57:09] from jacob before he got to the point
[1:57:12] that he would cling to him if we could
[1:57:13] only get there first
[1:57:15] to run quickly to him they meant to run
[1:57:17] quickly to him when the situation gets
[1:57:18] tough when we see things building up to
[1:57:20] say lord i see a lack
[1:57:23] i don't have everything i need
[1:57:25] so i'm coming to you and i'm clinging
[1:57:26] until i can get a revelation of it that
[1:57:28] settles my soul so that what i can sleep
[1:57:30] at night so i can rest during the day so
[1:57:32] that i can have a confidence that you're
[1:57:34] with me and you're working in the
[1:57:35] situation amen
[1:57:37] amen be like jacob then what we walk not
[1:57:40] with cockiness but with confidence that
[1:57:42] god is in our lives amen and that he's
[1:57:44] going to fulfill his word let's just
[1:57:45] pray
