[28:58] as I look back on what I thought wasn't
[29:03] Avene I'm amazed at the price I chose to
[29:12] pay and think I ignored what really
[29:19] mattered cuz I thought the sacrifice
[29:25] would be too
[29:30] but when I finally reach the point of
[29:34] giving in
[29:38] I found the cross was calling even
[29:46] and even though we're trying to survive
[29:54] I've never felt so much
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] for I am crucified with Christ
[30:13] not i but christ lives within me his
[30:20] cross will
[30:24] then
[30:26] engage
[30:29] oh it's not my string but he
[30:34] is there's no greater sacrifice
[30:39] I am crucified with Christ
[30:50] and yet
[30:59] as I hear the save a call for tea the
[31:04] time I will brown beneath the weight of
[31:12] Calvary then my hand surrender to his
[31:19] piercing purpose that holds me to the
[31:26] cross and sets me free
[31:32] [Music]
[31:41] I can't
[31:47] and with the suffering I identified
[31:55] and by His resurrection power
[32:06] crucify advice
[32:19] [Music]
[32:25] then
[32:30] for it's not my strength but he
[32:35] there's no better sacrifice for I am
[32:44] crucified with Christ
[32:51] and yet
[32:54] I will offer all I have
[33:01] so that is cross is not in there
[33:08] for I have found to live is Christ and
[33:13] to die is true
[33:19] I am crucified with rice and
[33:29] that i but christ lives within me his
[33:36] cross
[33:44] oh it's not my straight but he
[33:50] there's no greater sacrifice for I am
[33:57] crucified with Christ and
[34:05] not i but christ lives within me his
[34:12] cross will never us for more
[34:16] then
[34:20] [Music]
[34:21] for it's not my straight but he
[34:27] is there's no greater sacrifice
[34:33] [Music]
[34:45] Hey
[34:49] [Music]
[35:14] a man that was wonderful
[35:18] and this so true speaks to the speaks to
[35:21] the Christian experience doesn't it
[35:23] amen his cross will never ask for more
[35:26] than what they can give amen
[35:30] you know when you look at that sacrifice
[35:32] they'll really look what can you offer
[35:35] then oh yeah in ourselves were pretty
[35:38] fit we're pretty feeble aren't we pretty
[35:40] weak on our righteousness is as filthy
[35:43] rags thank God for His grace to us is
[35:47] all I could say because it just all this
[35:48] magnifies grace to me that's magnifies
[35:51] grace and it should bring us down more
[35:54] and more humble just so thankful for

[38:23] I just have a word of Prayer Heavenly
[38:26] Father as we stand here again Lord come
[38:28] to the house of God father were thankful
[38:30] Lord Jesus as my brother was just saying
[38:33] about grace Lord Father we cannot even
[38:35] Lord think that the depths of grace that
[38:38] you've done for us Lord father I pray
[38:41] that you'll just take the service
[38:42] tonight father speak to your people
[38:44] father I don't want to Lord project any
[38:48] of my own thoughts but I want to just
[38:50] project you father Lord Jesus is the
[38:52] mind of Christ has come down this day
[38:54] father I'm thankful for your grace for
[38:57] your mercy in our lives father I just
[38:59] want to know Lord that father this
[39:01] anybody needs to be touched here tonight
[39:03] father if you want to direct me a
[39:05] certain way lord I pray Lord that father
[39:08] you know how you yield to you you can
[39:11] direct me father granted I pray I asked
[39:14] us to the name of Jesus Christ God bless
[39:18] you Saints everybody fine tonight amen
[39:21] god bless you rest it for tonight you
[39:24] know friends the thing is is that if we
[39:26] have a good understanding of what the
[39:28] message is actually done for us in this
[39:30] day think about this John the Revelator
[39:33] everybody knows who John the Revelator
[39:35] is right well John the Revelator was at
[39:38] Calvary all right John the Revelator was
[39:40] in the upper room John the Revelator was
[39:43] with Jesus John the Revelator scene of
[39:46] many things but John the Revelator still
[39:48] wept and cried because nobody was able
[39:52] to take the book so all those things he
[39:55] seen but he still was weeping so
[39:58] understand friends this message of the
[40:00] hour the Lamb came forth took the book
[40:03] of Redemption and brought it down in
[40:06] whose hands as it is it's in our hands
[40:08] understand this friends John was in the
[40:11] upper room seeing Calvary seeing the
[40:13] empty tomb seen all those things seen
[40:15] the resurrection all those things but
[40:17] he's still wept and cried because nobody
[40:20] was worthy to take the book but our lamb
[40:22] was worthy
[40:24] his friends were in a day in an hour
[40:26] because you got to understand under the
[40:28] opening of the seventh seal comes forth
[40:32] again the mock Kazakh
[40:33] order back within our midst
[40:37] you know what that means that means
[40:39] we're in communion with him not just
[40:41] physically we'll get into this but it's
[40:43] nuts not physically but we're under the
[40:45] Melchizedek order under the opening of
[40:48] the seven seals it's actually true
[40:50] worship under the opening of the seven
[40:53] seals this is why friends the thing is
[40:55] is that two Tabernacles is the Levitical
[40:58] order or if I should say the
[40:59] denominational order or there's also the
[41:03] Melchizedek order understand France
[41:06] because what denominations are it's not
[41:09] taking the headship of the word anymore
[41:11] they booted him out of the church
[41:13] they've left him and I'm not just
[41:16] talking because you can be a one-man
[41:17] denomination see a one-man denomination
[41:20] will not take the headship of the word
[41:21] see friends but the bride she takes the
[41:24] headship of the word she doesn't have
[41:26] her own opinions she doesn't have her
[41:28] own mind
[41:29] she has the mind of Christ amen in this
[41:33] if you have your Bible turn to
[41:35] Revelation chapter five I just want to
[41:37] recap a little bit that we'll go into a
[41:40] little bit farther in this understanding
[41:43] that you know what God is actually doing
[41:46] within our midst in this day because
[41:48] like I says if you don't if you don't
[41:49] have an identity in the scriptures of
[41:53] yourself and who what God's called you
[41:55] to do friends it's hard to you know it's
[41:57] too abstract for you but we want
[42:00] concrete understanding of who we are
[42:02] where we come from not just by intellect
[42:05] but by revelation because we know the
[42:08] church is built by on Revelation amen
[42:11] let's read from verse eight and we had
[42:13] taken the book the four beasts and the
[42:15] four and twenty elders fell down before
[42:16] the lamb having one of them harps and
[42:20] golden vials full of odours which are
[42:22] the prayers of the saints and they sung
[42:24] a new song saying thou art worthy to
[42:27] take the book and to open the seals
[42:28] thereof for thou was slain and has
[42:31] redeemed us to God by the blood of a
[42:34] every kindred and tongue and people and
[42:37] nation he has made us us unto our God
[42:40] unto our God kings and priests and we
[42:43] shall reign on the earth in every seas
[42:47] now friends that's now that's not so
[42:49] much in the future that is now the
[42:51] scripture of course we know the book was
[42:54] closed and we know we understand in
[42:57] Revelations 10 was the opening was
[43:00] actually the mighty angel coming down
[43:02] spoke through a prophet understanding
[43:05] this friends if I and I hope you catch
[43:08] this is that we are the opening of the
[43:10] seven seals
[43:11] it's our life it's not something that is
[43:14] just in our thoughts or it's on pages is
[43:16] on tapes but it's actually in us because
[43:19] the breaking of the seals actually broke
[43:21] in your life and you're a part of the
[43:23] seven seals taking the book eat in the
[43:25] book and friends the thing is what it's
[43:27] actually happening you're finishing up
[43:29] the ministry of Jesus Christ and I know
[43:31] friends the thing is like I said last
[43:33] night many times people don't think
[43:35] they're important but we're all
[43:36] important is if we're in the body of
[43:38] Christ we all have a place we all have a
[43:40] position sometimes we think all who who
[43:44] really knows and who well I'm just a
[43:46] lazy person I said I'm church but let me
[43:49] say it this way friends if you know who
[43:52] you actually are what God can actually
[43:54] do with you is you can make you a mighty
[43:56] force in this end time now friends we
[43:59] all have our places we all families we
[44:01] got children's stuff like this and you
[44:03] know the father's a head of the home
[44:05] you've got a wife kids and stuff like
[44:07] this you got you there's something
[44:08] something you have to be doing with your
[44:11] family and to instill certain things in
[44:14] them and understand friends the thing is
[44:16] under the open of the seven seals
[44:17] there was a call that went forth it was
[44:19] a call for true worship true worship in
[44:22] spirit and truth because the thing is in
[44:24] today's way the denominations have gone
[44:29] we've seen all see the way they've gone
[44:30] but not not even just in the
[44:32] denominations it's in it's in the
[44:34] message now because the Prophet came
[44:36] along and says you know when in order
[44:38] for us to be actually have a power the
[44:41] bride I'm talking about is to be able to
[44:43] recognize that
[44:45] to spirits within the framework of a
[44:47] church see friends the thing is and
[44:49] every every every move of God there's
[44:51] always been twins and this is what I'm
[44:53] speaking about here tonight and I spoke
[44:55] about that last night is there was two
[44:56] for two Tabernacles or two forms of
[44:59] worship and one was ritualistic and one
[45:01] would go through the things because like
[45:02] I said last night when you looked at
[45:04] Abel and Cain Cain there was a lot of
[45:06] work he put into growing his garden but
[45:08] there's a lot of things he had to do and
[45:10] the thing is is that Abel all he had to
[45:12] go out in the field because he got a
[45:13] revelation gets the gets the lamb brings
[45:16] it in and sacrifices on the altar and
[45:18] the thing is is that it was something
[45:20] that was reflected in heaven and that's
[45:23] what the bride is actually doing she's
[45:25] actually reflecting something from
[45:27] heaven
[45:28] see we're sitting here tonight we're
[45:30] actually reflecting something from
[45:32] heaven it's not just our own doings it's
[45:34] not her just our own thoughts it's
[45:36] actually we're doing and we're
[45:38] reflecting something from God's mind and
[45:41] of course we are here tonight as the
[45:44] children of God we believe that we
[45:45] believe we're the bride of Jesus Christ
[45:47] all those different things but to have
[45:49] an understanding that we're actually
[45:50] there's a building going on right now
[45:52] it's called the body of Jesus Christ or
[45:55] the building of Jesus Christ now as I
[45:58] read last night the scriptures here 1st
[46:01] Peter chapter 2 verse 5 y'all we also as
[46:05] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[46:07] house a holy priesthood to offer
[46:10] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[46:12] by Jesus Christ first Peter first Peter
[46:15] chapter 2 verse 9 but ye are a chosen
[46:17] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[46:20] nation peculiar people that should show
[46:24] forth the praises of him who have called
[46:26] you all the darkness into his marvelous
[46:28] light which in time past we are not a
[46:30] people but are now the people of God
[46:33] which have not obtained mercy but now
[46:35] have obtained mercy now let's not just
[46:38] take things lightly because remember God
[46:40] wants expression in order to him for him
[46:43] to have expression he has that
[46:44] preeminence first thing he had to do was
[46:46] separate us from sin and death that's
[46:49] the first thing he had to do in order to
[46:51] get preeminence in us in order to give
[46:53] expression see the thing is is that it's
[46:56] all about the
[46:57] question of Jesus Christ now that's why
[47:00] I said last night the second coming of
[47:02] Jesus Christ is on earth right now we
[47:04] are it there's nobody else that we're
[47:06] looking for here this is this is the
[47:08] second coming of Jesus Christ and you
[47:10] know and we and sometimes some people
[47:12] just don't some people take that lightly
[47:15] or they don't really think about it but
[47:17] you imagine it's Jesus Christ in human
[47:19] flesh once again on earth now here's the
[47:22] characteristic of the brides that I was
[47:24] talking about last night
[47:25] one of the characteristics is that the
[47:26] eyes of your understanding will be
[47:28] enlightened he says that ye may know
[47:30] that the hope of his glory and what
[47:31] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[47:33] in the Saints so that's one of the
[47:36] characteristics of the bride she'll be
[47:38] initiated in the mysteries and once you
[47:41] know something it's simple right and you
[47:44] don't eat all mystery as a mystery but
[47:46] when the mysteries unveil its simple
[47:48] what you know what's behind it and if
[47:50] friends the thing is we are sitting here
[47:51] tonight and we've been initiated by the
[47:53] mysteries it's no longer a mystery to us
[47:55] it's a mystery in the in the
[47:57] denominations it's actually even
[47:59] sometimes a mystery amongst message
[48:00] people and the thing is is that things
[48:02] have not been actually opened up to them
[48:05] and some people don't believe that this
[48:06] see that seven seals been open see your
[48:08] friends the thing is is the seventh seal
[48:10] the seventh seal I think that's my phone
[48:19] don't worry to Africa but but there but
[48:29] the opening of the seventh seal some
[48:31] people don't believe the open sense
[48:32] beyond see it's not the first six seals
[48:34] that give such the problem or confusion
[48:36] it's the seventh seal and people when
[48:38] they're when they look at the seventh
[48:40] seal they look at it in a confusing way
[48:41] they try to study out they try to look
[48:44] at it this way look at that it's simple
[48:46] to me that I'm the unveiling of the
[48:48] seventh seal just like you are because
[48:49] revelations 10 see was to bring the
[48:52] seventh him him Christ the seventh seal
[48:54] bring him back to earth again
[48:56] and we know revelations 10 is the
[48:58] seventh seal I'm in that revelations 10
[49:00] brother bran was in revelation Stan the
[49:03] mighty angels in revelations 10 we're
[49:04] all in together and friends a thing is
[49:07] what I'm speaking about tonight it's all
[49:09] around
[49:10] and we'll go look at this later later at
[49:13] the end of the service but the
[49:14] understanding this is that friends we're
[49:16] back in the Melchizedek order from it
[49:18] from not just our own thinking not our
[49:20] Pentecostal ideas on our Catholic ideas
[49:23] not our denominational ideas were we're
[49:25] actually being taken to a place called
[49:27] the Melchizedek order and many people
[49:29] say though well the son of man ministry
[49:31] III he will I know where I'm missing a
[49:33] minute and the rapture and all I have to
[49:34] do is sit there yeah you just sit there
[49:37] but you absorb what God is actually
[49:39] doing in your life because it's the
[49:40] workings of God through your life see
[49:44] it's that's why a lot of people they
[49:45] just don't see God work in their life
[49:47] and that's when they get backslidden
[49:48] that's when they get depressed that's
[49:50] when they look down on themselves and
[49:52] all those things and says where's God
[49:54] where where is this and we're and
[49:55] friends what they don't see is the
[49:57] working of a living God working actually
[50:00] through their life and that's why
[50:01] friends will thing is that's what you
[50:03] have to see that the word is made flesh
[50:05] like I said last last night is this day
[50:08] the Scriptures fulfilled in us see
[50:10] friends that's the opening of the
[50:12] Seventh Seal that it's actually been
[50:15] redeemed see there's the sing questions
[50:17] over the blood is already we know the
[50:19] blood was already a blood was already
[50:22] spread on the mercy seat
[50:23] we know friends that's not the question
[50:25] anymore the question is now can we meet
[50:29] the enemy of this hour and I say Amen I
[50:32] can overcome myself because that's the
[50:36] greatest enemy I can have Satan right
[50:38] beside me and he's not my greatest enemy
[50:41] my greatest enemies me brother Branham
[50:44] says my greatest enemy is William Marion
[50:46] brim you know why that is because we
[50:48] caught we carry this thing around and it
[50:51] gives us all kinds of problems see
[50:53] friends because the DNA that you've been
[50:55] heritage from your parents their
[50:57] stubbornness their pridefulness all
[50:58] things you inherited in brother bounces
[51:00] from your great-grandfather grandfather
[51:03] all the way down here all that junk into
[51:05] you and that's why friends it's a
[51:07] greater greater thing happening right
[51:09] now because when Jesus came here two
[51:11] thousand years ago he didn't inherit all
[51:13] that DNA because he was born from the
[51:16] father right see now he's on a work on
[51:19] human beings that have a lot of junk in
[51:22] them and they are going to be overcomers
[51:25] because the word says though they're
[51:27] going to be overcomers that's the
[51:28] promise to us that's part of our
[51:30] inheritance amen
[51:32] I'm going to mean overcome by the grace
[51:34] of Almighty God not by my will and I'm
[51:37] like I says he's gonna Pat me in the
[51:39] back at the end and say he did a really
[51:41] good job but it's been all him that's
[51:43] done it now watch this as I read this
[51:46] quote last night and just so we can kind
[51:48] of draw a foundation here he said let
[51:50] now let me read the rest of this so I
[51:52] can get it you right quick now the
[51:54] eighth verse he says when they had taken
[51:55] the book of the four beasts the twenty
[51:57] and four and twenty elders fell down
[51:59] before the lamb having every one of them
[52:01] harps and golden vials of orders and
[52:03] prayers of the saints and now this is a
[52:06] time when everything must be worshipped
[52:08] now remember how appropriate
[52:10] now don't let us miss this now listen
[52:12] close when all the mysteries of the
[52:14] churches was finished which it is and
[52:16] all the mysteries of the plans were
[52:17] indention then seven seals was opened
[52:19] right immediately after this now look
[52:21] it's time for everything in heaven
[52:23] everything in earth to worship God now
[52:25] watch what takes place listen at it he
[52:27] says just this not this just a minute he
[52:30] says and they sung a new song saying
[52:31] thou art worthy listen what a worship
[52:35] was this was the elders the priests
[52:38] everything fell right before him see
[52:41] like I thought he says when he made his
[52:43] his complete plan it's a time of worship
[52:46] now listen he says listen them redeemed
[52:49] souls crying out there everything in
[52:51] heaven is worshiping the lamb so friends
[52:54] the thing is the Mount Zion as I was
[52:56] speaking a little bit last night mouths
[52:58] and of course nutria or Jerusalem or
[53:01] David actually brought the tabernacle of
[53:02] David back we all know that what
[53:04] happened is because James stands up in
[53:06] the first Church agent says no the the
[53:09] restoration is supposed to be the
[53:10] pattern Akal of David so the church ages
[53:13] was that was that was representing under
[53:14] tabernacle the wilderness Moses and then
[53:17] the tabernacle of David comes off and of
[53:19] course the millennium is going to be
[53:20] under the reign of Solomon so then we're
[53:22] honor living under the tabernacle of
[53:25] David and when you begin to begin to
[53:26] understand and get that in your mind
[53:28] it's not a real ritualistic form but
[53:31] it's actually a
[53:32] cathodic form of worship in other words
[53:35] friends were rejoicing praising
[53:38] everything that we were I was reading
[53:39] last night we're in where we're actually
[53:42] manifesting what actually David actually
[53:45] was doing in the Old Testament what
[53:47] James was saying that was going to be
[53:49] restored at this end time so we know
[53:51] that omit all the mysteries have been
[53:53] opened up we all know that but there's
[53:55] still two forms of systems working
[53:58] within the framework of the church
[54:00] there's the one that just goes to church
[54:02] ritualistic maybe has the dress rate has
[54:05] this rate has that right but there's no
[54:08] opening in their heart to actually have
[54:10] true worship back to God see and Friends
[54:14] of thing is that's one part of form of
[54:18] worship but it's not the worship that
[54:20] God is actually looking for see because
[54:22] what God is actually seeking for he's
[54:25] actually seeking for true worshipers
[54:27] he's not seeking people that are just
[54:30] ritualistic like a Pharisee not
[54:32] ritualistic like a sad you see or a
[54:34] Herodian he's actually looking for a
[54:37] seeking for a true were sure that's
[54:40] actually been birthed under the reveal
[54:42] word of this day now friends and I want
[54:45] to get this across to you real heavy
[54:46] here because the thing is is that the
[54:49] new birth is is the most necessary thing
[54:53] we need a born-again experience and it's
[54:58] going away by the wayside in the
[54:59] messages because every Bridge is piles
[55:01] in information and it's information
[55:03] information age and B let me just say it
[55:05] this way the way God's worked with a
[55:08] person 2,000 years ago as far when he
[55:11] brings them into a new birth and through
[55:13] an adoption through a process he works
[55:15] the same way tonight in this day and age
[55:18] we're in a technology type of age where
[55:20] we got computers we got the phones and
[55:23] all this and all this technology and we
[55:25] want to quick facts like this all the
[55:27] time but God doesn't work with men he
[55:29] didn't ever change his way the way he
[55:31] works with men he works with men the
[55:34] same ways who work 2,000 years ago see
[55:36] it's a process
[55:37] see that's why friends the thing is and
[55:39] many times when you talk about the
[55:40] rapture people think the rapture is
[55:42] something on on the outside of them but
[55:45] is not the rapture the rapture is inside
[55:48] see it's an actual many events in an
[55:52] individual's life that are actually
[55:54] taking taking a process in order to go
[55:57] in the rapture it's not something that's
[55:59] going to be one day it's gonna be
[56:00] lottery to hell my numbers come up I'm
[56:02] gonna go in the rapture it's not that
[56:03] we're actually in our process because
[56:06] like I said Enoch walked with with with
[56:08] God for 365 years he walked with God and
[56:12] friends the thing is is that it ain't
[56:14] always a process for you not the enoch
[56:16] baby get tired sometimes maybe he did
[56:18] maybe he made mistakes because a person
[56:20] went the holy ghost can still make
[56:22] mistakes but they want to get right with
[56:23] the Lord right away see that is a
[56:25] difference so wondering what God is
[56:27] looking for he's seeking for is a true
[56:29] worshiper now we read last night that
[56:31] Matthew 15 verse 8 he says and people
[56:34] draw nigh unto me with their mouth and
[56:36] artha me with their lips but their heart
[56:38] is far from me so but they they still
[56:41] worship they come to church clap their
[56:45] hands they still sing they still worship
[56:48] but they it but it's just with their
[56:50] lips it's not it's not reality to them
[56:53] it's not the Living God I achieve
[56:55] working in them but they're still
[56:57] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[56:59] of men
[57:00] so friends the thing is there so there's
[57:02] two forms of worship one will have the
[57:05] pillar of fire and one won't you realize
[57:08] this the third pole is it we know it's
[57:11] not a public show you realize they could
[57:13] be preaching here tonight and the person
[57:16] next to you might not begin and the
[57:18] other person right next year is getting
[57:19] it that's the way it works you just you
[57:22] I I'm not here to sort anything out it's
[57:25] not up to me it's up to God see friends
[57:28] the people gonna be sitting right in
[57:29] church service under the third pole
[57:30] preaching because part of the third pole
[57:32] preaching is preaching the lost and they
[57:35] can be hearing the pure word on dross
[57:37] and altering Word of God and they still
[57:40] cannot get it because they have no new
[57:42] birth in them no representation in them
[57:44] I can't do that I mean I can't do
[57:47] nothing both that so when gave up in the
[57:49] in the book of Acts and this is after
[57:51] this I'll return and I'll build again
[57:53] the tabernacle of David which is falling
[57:55] down I'll build again the
[57:57] runes thereof and I'll set it up and we
[58:00] know the class that I was saying the
[58:02] Pharisees were trying to get the
[58:03] Gentiles to come back under the law of
[58:06] God as far onto the Levitical order they
[58:09] were trying to get them to come back and
[58:11] in order to say that's where salvation
[58:12] is but the thing is is that when Jesus
[58:15] came he done away with a little bit of
[58:17] glory amen see them when the Levitical
[58:20] order was because what it was it was a
[58:23] Micah's order coming on the scene right
[58:25] now as we go see and understand this is
[58:29] that David would be like I was playing
[58:31] last night was prophet King and and
[58:35] preached well you didn't have that in
[58:37] the Old Testament that wasn't supposed
[58:38] to be a king wasn't supposed to be a
[58:40] priest but it actually was a type for us
[58:43] showing us that this Tabernacle were
[58:45] restored in this end time and you not
[58:48] being realized friends it was a one-room
[58:51] tent and priests could come in now in
[58:54] time knock on the waters Moses's
[58:56] Tabernacle they couldn't do what they
[58:58] could do what they could do then but
[59:00] what God wants in this day and age is a
[59:03] face to face communion because we're in
[59:06] a face-to-face age and what is that
[59:09] that's the presence of God in you the
[59:11] presence of God will never depart the
[59:14] bride once she is born again once she is
[59:17] saved by the presence of God but God
[59:19] German ties in that scene in you friends
[59:21] the thing is is that you're in a tent
[59:23] meeting with God himself
[59:25] and that's what the restoration of the
[59:28] tabernacle David was actually referring
[59:30] to because the thing is that you had the
[59:32] tent gimme on and you had the tent in in
[59:35] in the New Jerusalem if I could say it
[59:36] that way or in Jerusalem or the City of
[59:38] David or Mount Sion so he had two things
[59:41] right so and so in other words friends
[59:44] the thing is is that they're coming to
[59:45] Jerusalem it was this new form or a new
[59:48] order that Dave was actually bringing in
[59:50] now we had a prophet in this generation
[59:52] that actually brought in a new order it
[59:55] was not like any other order before it
[59:58] for the last 2,000 years
[59:59] see Jesus would he came he brought that
[1:00:02] new order in but the thing is is that
[1:00:04] they went by the way of denominational
[1:00:06] thinking or a little vertical type of
[1:00:07] thinking
[1:00:08] they have to do this and do that do this
[1:00:10] no we're here to freely worship God
[1:00:14] worship God without hinders I know our
[1:00:17] flesh gives us Enders but I'm talking
[1:00:18] about in rejoicing
[1:00:20] clapping worshiping God all those
[1:00:22] different things under the order of
[1:00:25] Melchizedek nation lism or the order of
[1:00:27] a little vehicle but under the order of
[1:00:29] Melchizedek this is why friends the
[1:00:32] thing is is that people when we look at
[1:00:34] all this tonight to understand that
[1:00:37] people are actually worshiping God false
[1:00:41] falsely and I'm not just talking me
[1:00:43] nomination systems I'm talking within
[1:00:45] the framework of the message amen they
[1:00:49] have a form of godliness but they're
[1:00:52] denying the very power that came in this
[1:00:54] day and that's why friends the thing is
[1:00:56] is that they're under a false pretense
[1:00:58] they're on the worshipping God on the
[1:01:01] outside they're like in the tabernacle
[1:01:03] the in the wilderness
[1:01:05] there's no Ark of the Covenant there no
[1:01:08] soul no let's just move on here and I'll
[1:01:10] just cover a couple things here and
[1:01:12] we'll move on to where I really want to
[1:01:13] get to tonight who was that then what
[1:01:16] did the veil rent remember it was death
[1:01:18] to go into nobody could see it most saw
[1:01:21] in the form it was a world it was a
[1:01:22] man's back well here it is a bleeding
[1:01:25] back the same man what was it God wanted
[1:01:28] to show them the mercy seat God wanted
[1:01:31] to show them who he was
[1:01:32] so the veil in the temple from the hand
[1:01:35] of God above was rent from top to bottom
[1:01:37] and show God in plain view it was Jesus
[1:01:40] Christ hanging on the cross the mercy
[1:01:43] seat now after after this now okay
[1:01:47] Ephesus the high priests and all the
[1:01:49] Jews and all those certain things they
[1:01:51] would still go to the temple but God did
[1:01:54] not recognize it there was no emergency
[1:01:56] there was no place to put the blood so
[1:01:58] I'd see what they were doing they're
[1:02:00] actually worshipping God by their
[1:02:02] imagination how many people come to
[1:02:06] church and actually worship of God by
[1:02:09] imagination because we're actually under
[1:02:12] the bleeding word
[1:02:14] amen while you're here tonight as a
[1:02:17] bleeding work and the bleeding word is
[1:02:20] what gives life see there's a bleeding
[1:02:22] word that is sprinkled on the people
[1:02:24] because remember when Moses came down
[1:02:26] he's put put it on the book and they had
[1:02:29] actually ate the juice at Amen before
[1:02:32] they got the blood sprinkled on them it
[1:02:33] was not just okay yeah I believe it but
[1:02:36] there was a death if they actually Amen
[1:02:38] the word and Moses took the blood and
[1:02:41] sprinkled it on the people because what
[1:02:43] was it it was a covenant he was making
[1:02:45] and that's happened in this day when
[1:02:46] people are actually yet the born-again
[1:02:49] experience really depth actually
[1:02:51] revelaed it in the depths of God see the
[1:02:54] blood is sprinkled on them now we'll get
[1:02:56] into tomorrow because the thing is as
[1:02:58] you walk in the light as he is in light
[1:03:01] then the blood covers you now remember
[1:03:04] friends the light is first and then the
[1:03:06] blood not the blood first and then the
[1:03:09] light you got to be walking in the light
[1:03:11] of the hour and if I ask you the
[1:03:14] question what is the light of the hour
[1:03:16] I might get how many people 20 30 40
[1:03:18] people hear different answers you know
[1:03:20] what because what people think what the
[1:03:22] light is they think it's a message book
[1:03:25] they think it's a tape and I always get
[1:03:31] some message people just wait talking
[1:03:33] about no friends you got to know what
[1:03:35] the light is it's more than the tape and
[1:03:38] it's more than so understand those
[1:03:41] friends of thing is that we need the
[1:03:43] veil ripped to understand what we're
[1:03:46] actually worship see Jesus veil was
[1:03:49] ripped on the Calvary with the believer
[1:03:52] would know what they're worshiping but
[1:03:54] the Jews have built their whole system
[1:03:56] on things from the old tests and their
[1:03:58] whole root systems that the religion was
[1:04:00] built on worshiping Jehovah and the
[1:04:03] thing is that here's your wagon on the
[1:04:05] crop and they didn't recognizes no
[1:04:08] osseous st. John 2 and 19 Jesus answer
[1:04:12] sit on them destroy this temple and
[1:04:13] three days I'll raise it up so two
[1:04:16] temples like I said in the existence
[1:04:18] ain't done to High Priest is the same
[1:04:19] time - always always at the same time
[1:04:22] and the thing is so they were
[1:04:24] should be in the wrong place the Jews
[1:04:26] were because they there was a high
[1:04:29] priest named Jesus Christ who's touched
[1:04:31] by the feeling of our infirmities so you
[1:04:33] can come to church here tonight
[1:04:35] he knows how you're feeling because he
[1:04:38] was one of us one time he knows so we
[1:04:40] can actually take me cannot you touch
[1:04:42] him by the feeling of her in Fermi's
[1:04:44] we're not feel good her this doesn't and
[1:04:47] he knows what you're going through
[1:04:49] because he actually brought all those
[1:04:50] things into him when he was here on
[1:04:52] earth to be tempted of those things you
[1:04:54] realize brother man told us that Jesus
[1:04:56] was tempted by women he says he was
[1:04:59] tempted by alcohol he was tempted by all
[1:05:01] these damn things you know what friends
[1:05:03] he wasn't born that way because you
[1:05:05] didn't have all the DNA he had actually
[1:05:07] bring those things into him to know how
[1:05:09] you would feel see friends the thing is
[1:05:12] is that you were born in a body that has
[1:05:15] an addictive type of personalities and a
[1:05:17] lot of different things it could be
[1:05:19] gossipy
[1:05:19] it could be drinking it could be smoking
[1:05:22] give me all these things that are in
[1:05:23] your body and you're overconfident and
[1:05:25] God knows how you feel because he
[1:05:27] brought all those things into himself to
[1:05:29] know what it was like so you can be
[1:05:31] touched by the feeling of your
[1:05:33] infirmities oh yeah so watch the to dive
[1:05:36] around where the mercy was behind the
[1:05:38] veil Hebrews 10:19 having therefore
[1:05:41] brethren boldness enter in the hoist of
[1:05:44] the blood by the blood of Jesus by a new
[1:05:47] and living way what she had consecrated
[1:05:50] for us through the veil that is to say
[1:05:53] his flesh so he was actually making a
[1:05:57] new living way now remember this is the
[1:06:00] Melchizedek order get your mind away
[1:06:03] from any nomination order get your mind
[1:06:05] away from a little bit of order because
[1:06:07] the thing is is that God was actually
[1:06:09] bringing in a new order because remember
[1:06:12] the Old Testament they feared to going
[1:06:14] behind the veil but we want to vent we
[1:06:17] don't have to fear going in behind the
[1:06:19] veil and I know when the denominational
[1:06:22] churches go to church they read from the
[1:06:25] same Bible we do they cop sing gospel
[1:06:28] songs nothing there's good people in
[1:06:29] there I'm not trying to put them down
[1:06:31] they're good people
[1:06:32] nation in the nomination right but I
[1:06:35] understand this by God's grace we have
[1:06:37] been opened up to another order we've
[1:06:40] been actually a changing of an order in
[1:06:43] this day where we can actually worship
[1:06:45] under the opening of the Seventh Seal
[1:06:47] people don't get to get that in these
[1:06:49] denominations we get it we understand
[1:06:52] those things because why we're under new
[1:06:54] order and David when he came back to
[1:06:56] Jerusalem he brought a new organ
[1:06:58] a new preached a new order of worship
[1:07:00] all those things and Friends of things
[1:07:02] were brought into a new order being the
[1:07:04] bride Jesus Christ of worsley praising
[1:07:07] him without any hindrance but rejoice in
[1:07:09] all those different things friends the
[1:07:11] thing is by not the MAL Catholic order
[1:07:13] we have brought into that see friends
[1:07:15] it's not just something that is we can
[1:07:17] read about who's a schmuck as if we're
[1:07:19] in that order
[1:07:20] that's the order we're honor see because
[1:07:22] remember friends the thing is is that
[1:07:24] when David was brought the ark back what
[1:07:27] was he showing actually he was showing
[1:07:29] the falseness of of no Ark of the
[1:07:33] Covenant behind the Tabernacle in the
[1:07:35] wilderness when Jesus come and they rent
[1:07:37] the veil he was showing that there was
[1:07:39] no art looked on behind there it was
[1:07:41] false religion what do the seals do for
[1:07:44] us in this day and showed us the
[1:07:46] Antichrist system and show the
[1:07:48] Antichrist system for the last two
[1:07:50] thousand years under the denominational
[1:07:52] systems and all they were doing was
[1:07:54] false worship but when you read any
[1:07:56] shortest sort of opening of the seven
[1:07:58] seals he shows him a true worship is and
[1:08:00] we're under that call we didn't call
[1:08:02] back to that no he says this he says
[1:08:05] remember we have shown clearly all
[1:08:07] through the ages then even as out of
[1:08:09] these foul because they left the word
[1:08:11] soul Ephesian age felt by turning the
[1:08:13] sliding from the word until is every age
[1:08:16] continue to turn away we have a final
[1:08:19] repetition of the word by the world
[1:08:21] church system the lay on scene ends in a
[1:08:27] blackout of the word thereby causing the
[1:08:29] departure of the Lord from the mist now
[1:08:33] brother Bram in the same season of the
[1:08:37] opilio seven seals he preaches
[1:08:38] indictment do you realize in the message
[1:08:41] and I can he says there will be another
[1:08:43] denied indictment because
[1:08:45] bouncing off the scene now we're in the
[1:08:48] mat-su schnell and there's another
[1:08:49] indictment actually going on right
[1:08:51] because the majority of the preaching
[1:08:53] the word I shouldn't say the majority
[1:08:56] but the preaching of the third Pole word
[1:08:58] third pole preaching is actually
[1:09:00] preaching the loss and the thing is what
[1:09:03] it is friends they people have left the
[1:09:06] word for church joining if I could say
[1:09:10] it this way for message joining for
[1:09:12] message theology message intellectual
[1:09:14] that's what they've joined the push in
[1:09:17] the word out and says well I want more
[1:09:19] information one more investment and
[1:09:20] that's all this it's not reality to them
[1:09:22] and the thing is is that their soul and
[1:09:25] but now we're slowly but more and more I
[1:09:27] don't hate that you see this message
[1:09:28] five years down the road but slowly
[1:09:30] moving the word out and what it is it
[1:09:32] they're doing the same thing as he did
[1:09:34] in Davis time and I'm under Jesus's
[1:09:37] Tabernacle see they're actually pushing
[1:09:39] the word out where there's no Ark of the
[1:09:40] Covenant monks them
[1:09:41] there's no pillar of Father there's no
[1:09:43] mercy all those things and what it is is
[1:09:45] showing the fallacy of worship and
[1:09:47] friends the thing is that we're in that
[1:09:49] time period right now where people are
[1:09:52] feeding on things that aren't even the
[1:09:54] word anymore because they've left the
[1:09:56] word a long time ago now let me just say
[1:10:00] it this way to you now friends how much
[1:10:03] air can you have and still make it how
[1:10:07] much air can you have in your belief
[1:10:10] system and still make it one two three
[1:10:15] four four things how many things can you
[1:10:18] see because we've been given a perfect
[1:10:20] word and brother Bram said that the
[1:10:24] bride will here in this perfect word
[1:10:26] once again as they did at the day of
[1:10:28] Pentecost so friends were sitting here
[1:10:31] tonight how much air can we have and
[1:10:34] still make it see you know people don't
[1:10:39] think about it I think they think well
[1:10:41] okay I believe the message but what's
[1:10:43] the message what's the message of the
[1:10:45] hour what actually is its Christ
[1:10:48] unveiling himself in you
[1:10:51] but people they said they put it on on
[1:10:55] this they put it on that they put and
[1:10:56] actually they make an idol of it see
[1:10:59] because the thing is that Christ is not
[1:11:01] alive in them
[1:11:02] Christ is something outside of them not
[1:11:06] understand that the crisis ought to be
[1:11:08] unveiled in them
[1:11:09] that's why friends the thing is is that
[1:11:11] when we look at David's David's tavern
[1:11:13] up here at the restoration of it it
[1:11:15] really truly means should mean something
[1:11:17] to us because the restoration took place
[1:11:19] not just friends the thing is as a yeah
[1:11:22] I believe that we've had a restoration
[1:11:23] problem but actually a restoration in
[1:11:26] your own life took place individually
[1:11:28] not just in churches but in the vision
[1:11:31] of restoration took place in you now
[1:11:34] brother Brad says David was not only
[1:11:35] King but he was a prophet so a prophet
[1:11:38] priest and King goes on again he says II
[1:11:41] even David himself the greatest military
[1:11:44] genius that Israel ever had and yet Dave
[1:11:47] was a prophet sir t was he was a prophet
[1:11:49] David so David the Prophet brought in
[1:11:53] another way of worship a prophet came in
[1:11:57] this generation and brought in another
[1:12:00] way of worship under the Melchizedek
[1:12:03] order and watch friends because the
[1:12:06] thing is the tabernacle Moses everybody
[1:12:09] was used to the town of Moses in the
[1:12:11] denominational systems right and when a
[1:12:14] prophet came onto the scene and they
[1:12:16] begin to begin to preach the Melchizedek
[1:12:19] or people refused that is actually
[1:12:23] hopping again within the message see
[1:12:26] because the thing is is that under the
[1:12:28] opening of the seals what it did for us
[1:12:30] have brought the bride the true bride
[1:12:33] back into another order so we've come
[1:12:36] into a new and living way see it's the
[1:12:41] God don't wait that ignorance that
[1:12:44] wiggins all over with that's why you
[1:12:48] know people can get by with this couple
[1:12:50] if they could be appeal to get by with
[1:12:52] anything in this day and age then what
[1:12:54] in the world are we doing what are we
[1:12:57] actually preaching about what are we
[1:12:59] actually believing because the thing is
[1:13:01] is that in this hour the priest
[1:13:04] has changed because the book was closed
[1:13:07] now it's open
[1:13:09] and he made his kings and priests so
[1:13:11] under the Levitical order type the time
[1:13:13] Michael Mo's or type the church inches
[1:13:15] but in this age on Mount Zion is
[1:13:18] actually bringing back the mckusick
[1:13:21] order the bride actually brings back the
[1:13:24] about Cossack order we had a prophet for
[1:13:26] Asian but there's actually a life source
[1:13:29] coming out of the bride this way I
[1:13:34] always say did you really know who you
[1:13:36] are you're actually the door to
[1:13:38] salvation I'm talking about the bride
[1:13:42] see when somebody comes to you you can
[1:13:44] actually impart into them life because
[1:13:49] why because you got the life it'll be
[1:13:54] the same way as you live in 2000 and
[1:13:56] Jesus speaking to someone have the words
[1:13:59] of eternal life the words of eternal
[1:14:01] life now it's out of the bride under the
[1:14:04] Month category
[1:14:05] she's the one that speaks she's the one
[1:14:08] that's the arc so friends the thing is
[1:14:11] the McKenith of casick of this day is
[1:14:13] actually the bride manifesting though
[1:14:18] the order of Melchizedek a new
[1:14:21] priesthood a prophetic people right now
[1:14:27] in Hebrews 7 1 4 this bout Catholic
[1:14:30] Kings Salem priest of the Most High
[1:14:32] so we know that David was a priest was a
[1:14:36] king and a prophet now for is the thing
[1:14:38] is he was a prophet and he stood before
[1:14:40] the ark as a in the office of a priest
[1:14:43] in the art of the tabernacle of David
[1:14:46] first samuel of 6:17 and they brought
[1:14:49] the Ark of the Lord set it in this place
[1:14:51] in the midst of the tabernacle David
[1:14:52] that pitched for it and David offered
[1:14:54] burnt offerings and peace offerings
[1:14:56] before the Lord and as soon as David
[1:14:58] made an end of offering burnt offers
[1:15:01] peace arms he blessed the people you
[1:15:04] realize only the high priest could bless
[1:15:06] the people but David standing in an
[1:15:09] office of a priest
[1:15:12] do you know who you are or are we I'm
[1:15:18] Todd your friends under the opening of
[1:15:20] the Seventh Seal if you don't know who
[1:15:22] you are friends it's gonna get scary as
[1:15:24] we go along in this message because
[1:15:27] everybody says they're born again but
[1:15:29] the thing is there's got to be a
[1:15:30] manifestation or an expression of this
[1:15:32] born-again experience he says that Moses
[1:15:35] and Aaron went to the town Medical
[1:15:36] College came out and blessed the people
[1:15:38] same as David did under the map Kasikorn
[1:15:42] he brought them out cousin quarter back
[1:15:44] to Jerusalem and the bride brings them
[1:15:46] the cows quarter back to Jerusalem
[1:15:48] because we are the New Jerusalem
[1:15:51] understand friends the thing is is that
[1:15:53] the to town Michaels there's a
[1:15:55] difference between those abit accord or
[1:15:57] denomination order and I'm a classic
[1:15:59] order but many people are still faking
[1:16:03] denominational terms I'm talking in the
[1:16:06] message friends let me just say this so
[1:16:08] you can understand I don't have to go
[1:16:10] down to the Bible bookstore and pick up
[1:16:13] the book and say how I could be a better
[1:16:14] pastor I don't have to go down the
[1:16:18] bottle bookstore and say well how do I
[1:16:20] raise my family and read a book on some
[1:16:22] theologian that wrote about family
[1:16:24] probably divorced three or four times I
[1:16:26] don't have to do that I have an outcast
[1:16:30] order in this day and age I have a life
[1:16:33] source so they can go to and that life
[1:16:36] source tells me because what it is is
[1:16:38] that mount Catholic order within Zion
[1:16:41] within the New Jerusalem so I have to go
[1:16:43] up there I don't have to do that I don't
[1:16:45] have to go and get psychology books and
[1:16:48] friends the thing is I don't need that
[1:16:50] because the thing is that we have
[1:16:51] everything that we have need them in
[1:16:52] this day and age that's been sent to us
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:56] I don't have to go outside of that now
[1:16:58] watch this verse 6 verse 4 6 chapter 5
[1:17:02] he saves on us also in another place
[1:17:05] thou art a priest forever after the
[1:17:08] order of Melchizedek so David's time
[1:17:13] David brought me back the order of
[1:17:15] Melchizedek or the order of my Catholic
[1:17:17] back to Jerusalem now we're sitting here
[1:17:20] and we're in this about Kazik order so
[1:17:23] in other words friends were on the
[1:17:24] my cousin in Christ I'm it's the same
[1:17:26] thing now friends the thing is in this
[1:17:29] age under the openness seven seals were
[1:17:31] under the same thing that Christ was and
[1:17:34] was dead was and it was promised by
[1:17:37] James that the restoration of the
[1:17:39] tabernacle of David would happen in this
[1:17:41] date this is the time that I'm in this
[1:17:43] is the time I'm living this I'm not
[1:17:45] living than any other time I'm living in
[1:17:47] the bride time I'm Britain living in the
[1:17:49] bride age from the church ages to the
[1:17:52] bride age we're surrounded by the aoc
[1:17:55] nage which is always trying to make us
[1:17:58] lazy always trying to make us lukewarm I
[1:18:00] was trying to make this cool I was
[1:18:02] trying to make this formal but friends
[1:18:04] the thing is shake that thing off shake
[1:18:07] it off let God's begin to rule and reign
[1:18:09] in your life let God do something with
[1:18:12] you no washes he says the law was given
[1:18:15] to Moses failed he came down struck the
[1:18:18] rock that was in his hand through it
[1:18:19] down broke the commandments on because
[1:18:21] of weakness he had was a temper he broke
[1:18:24] the commandments and went back showing
[1:18:26] the priests the Levitical priesthood
[1:18:28] would be broken the Levitical priesthood
[1:18:31] we booked these nomination systems would
[1:18:34] be broken under the breaking of the
[1:18:37] seven seals there's a people that lives
[1:18:40] in this endtime that lives under the
[1:18:42] Melchizedek order doesn't live under
[1:18:45] some denomination idea some
[1:18:46] denominational opinion some
[1:18:48] denominational things but friends the
[1:18:50] thing is they live under the high score
[1:18:52] because the Levitical priesthood can
[1:18:54] never make you perfect denominational
[1:18:57] denominational order will never make you
[1:19:00] perfect
[1:19:00] you know why friends because the
[1:19:02] denomination or the Levitical priesthood
[1:19:05] there's no callings in it there's only
[1:19:07] calling under the Melchizedek order
[1:19:09] there's only a calling under the Seventh
[1:19:12] Seal see your birth by the will of God
[1:19:14] you're not birth because that will do to
[1:19:17] be birth I never will Jim it's only God
[1:19:20] that wills you to be birth it's not my
[1:19:23] flesh but on another denominational
[1:19:25] system or our denominational thinking I
[1:19:27] know a biblical order it was by their
[1:19:29] calling
[1:19:30] man's calling but we're not under man's
[1:19:33] car
[1:19:34] we're under God's Khan because the Bible
[1:19:36] said it st. John 1:12 but as many as
[1:19:39] received him to them gave he power to
[1:19:41] become sense of God even to them that
[1:19:43] believe on his name was you're born not
[1:19:45] of blood nor the will of flesh nor the
[1:19:49] will of man but of God it's God's will
[1:19:52] that I'm living in the same time under
[1:19:55] the mouth kasica it's his will it's not
[1:19:57] your will not my will it's his will
[1:20:01] that's why friends the thing is is that
[1:20:03] we're not under carnal thing here it's
[1:20:05] not a carnal lineage like they had a
[1:20:07] little bit of court or denomination
[1:20:09] it's not under that lineage it's under
[1:20:11] the lineage of the Living God I came
[1:20:13] from the mind of God I came from God I'm
[1:20:17] going back to God that's why friends the
[1:20:19] thing is my soul was a part of God my
[1:20:22] soul was a part of that priesthood my
[1:20:25] soul was a part of that Malpensa order
[1:20:27] that's why friends I can manifest when I
[1:20:30] manifested you know what because I'm a
[1:20:32] part of it
[1:20:34] Hebrews 7 verse 11 if therefore perfect
[1:20:39] swear by the little bit ago priesthood
[1:20:40] for honor the people receive the law he
[1:20:44] said what father need was there that
[1:20:45] another priest should rise after the
[1:20:47] order of Melchizedek he should not be
[1:20:49] called after the order of Aaron no
[1:20:53] perfection in a little bit of order only
[1:20:56] perfection under the mckusick order
[1:20:58] we're living in a time we've had a
[1:21:01] perfect word there's going to be a
[1:21:02] perfect bride that hears the word in its
[1:21:05] purity absolutely purity that's why I
[1:21:10] don't have to go like I said to a Bible
[1:21:12] bookstore I don't have to listen to
[1:21:14] nominal preachers translate I don't have
[1:21:17] to listen I go on I listen to brother
[1:21:19] Brown and I know Christ came down and
[1:21:22] through that veil begin to preaches
[1:21:23] Christ and that call went out on the
[1:21:26] Seventh Seal
[1:21:26] now I'm worshiping under the Seventh
[1:21:29] Seal I'm worshiping under the
[1:21:31] Melchizedek or friends the thing is if
[1:21:34] we only knew how lucky we were how
[1:21:36] blessed we are
[1:21:37] how much grace in our life is that we're
[1:21:40] actually worshiping under that order
[1:21:42] first 12 for the priesthood being
[1:21:44] changed there is made of a necessity a
[1:21:48] change also of the law only the high
[1:21:52] priests ago in the Holies
[1:21:54] not now only the high priests ago no
[1:21:59] authority but a friends the thing is
[1:22:01] that now every priest that is called
[1:22:03] kings and priests
[1:22:05] every priest says call can go to the
[1:22:07] holds the Holies and have that
[1:22:09] fellowship amen now verse 16 speaking of
[1:22:13] of the malkos priesthood who is me not
[1:22:16] out for the law of carnal commandment
[1:22:17] but after the power of an endless life
[1:22:21] that's the Michela school we're off to
[1:22:24] the power of an endless life will never
[1:22:28] be done we are eternal beings not these
[1:22:31] bodies these bodies aren't born again
[1:22:34] but friends realized friends you are for
[1:22:36] the power of an endless life verse 19
[1:22:39] for the law the law the Lilith of the
[1:22:43] mythical law had no power in it but but
[1:22:46] it made nothing perfect but the bringing
[1:22:48] of the better hope did by which we draw
[1:22:51] nigh on to God so what was David trying
[1:22:55] to what was this whole thing about was
[1:22:57] trying to get people close to God you
[1:23:00] couldn't do it on the denominational
[1:23:02] systems he not only is thinking he can
[1:23:04] only get close to God under the mile
[1:23:06] kassig order that's why we needed a
[1:23:09] knife cuts quarter so much that's the
[1:23:10] only reason
[1:23:11] instead have communion with action with
[1:23:13] God himself he says now the Levitical
[1:23:16] brother Graham says sees that the death
[1:23:18] of Lord Jesus now we live in the
[1:23:21] Malkovich priesthood Christ that's what
[1:23:24] we're up a men so you got all that now
[1:23:31] let me preach my message see understand
[1:23:38] friends if you can have an understand
[1:23:41] we've been brought into this age and and
[1:23:44] I'm not saying you don't have the
[1:23:46] revelation I'm just saying it would help
[1:23:47] you because so many people think the
[1:23:51] message is apart from them but I am
[1:23:55] that prophet spoke I've come out of the
[1:23:59] pages of the message in a manifest in
[1:24:01] what those pages said about me
[1:24:02] I've come in the volume of the book like
[1:24:06] Jesus says i come in the volume of the
[1:24:08] book I've actually come that's where you
[1:24:10] guys you've come and out of the volume
[1:24:11] of the book with that prophet said about
[1:24:14] you you are amen now watch the Psalms 84
[1:24:18] 4 blessed are they that dwell in the
[1:24:21] house they all still be still praising
[1:24:24] the Selah blessed is the man who
[1:24:26] strengthens thee in who's far the ways
[1:24:29] of them who passing through the valley
[1:24:32] of the baka make it a well the rain also
[1:24:36] fills the pools
[1:24:37] he says they go from strength to
[1:24:39] strength every one of them in Zion
[1:24:41] appeareth before God in Zion under the
[1:24:45] Melchizedek order we peers before God so
[1:24:48] everyone that is in Zion appears before
[1:24:51] God we're under the Melchizedek order
[1:24:54] okay
[1:24:55] everybody still with me I know I'm
[1:24:58] preaching a lot of word here somebody
[1:24:59] goes but hopefully by God's grace he'll
[1:25:01] he'll give you the revelation of it
[1:25:03] because they understand what we've been
[1:25:05] called into first Peter chapter 2 verse
[1:25:07] 5 he also has lovely stones are built up
[1:25:10] a spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[1:25:12] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:25:15] to God by Jesus Christ this only comes
[1:25:19] under the breaking of the seventh seal
[1:25:21] this is what we didn't called into he
[1:25:24] says the ER chosen generation a royal
[1:25:26] priesthood a holy nation peculiar people
[1:25:30] that should show forth the praises of
[1:25:32] him who hath called you out of the
[1:25:34] darkness into his marvelous light
[1:25:37] this only happens under the Melchizedek
[1:25:40] Priesthood this is all about you friends
[1:25:44] see the Seventh Seal is to bring the
[1:25:47] bride into the mount cast or so we are
[1:25:50] kings and priests sitting here tonight
[1:25:53] amen so you are spiritual house right
[1:25:56] priesthood making sacrifices priest
[1:25:59] living priesthood obeying a priesthood
[1:26:03] under the order all those different
[1:26:05] things what is it because you've been
[1:26:06] brought back to sign
[1:26:07] Xion types the broad only the Zion can
[1:26:10] come in to the New Jerusalem because
[1:26:12] they are the New Jersey thus all Israel
[1:26:15] brought up the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:26:17] the Lord with shouting so when they
[1:26:20] return to Zion the show they begin the
[1:26:23] shoutout what because the Ark of the
[1:26:26] Covenant was coming back
[1:26:28] amen and that's what's copy to this day
[1:26:31] the Ark of the Covenant actually come
[1:26:33] about and the Lord himself shall descend
[1:26:34] with a shout and we know the shout is
[1:26:36] the message but friends don't leave it
[1:26:39] just on paper and tapes bring it into
[1:26:41] yourself see friends the thing is is
[1:26:43] that when David prophet Tom Rock he was
[1:26:45] bringing it back to where to Mount Zion
[1:26:48] amen
[1:26:50] I shaft for seven verse 48 howbeit to
[1:26:54] the most high dwells not in temples made
[1:26:56] with hands as saith the Prophet
[1:26:58] happiness my throne and earth is my
[1:27:00] footstool whose house we build me he
[1:27:03] says save the Lord or what is the place
[1:27:06] of my rest Zara bright new juice we are
[1:27:12] his rest remember I rode for a read last
[1:27:14] night
[1:27:14] he desires us he desires more than we
[1:27:18] desire ourselves
[1:27:19] he says shows that God doesn't dwell on
[1:27:22] houses made with hands God dwells in
[1:27:24] human hearts he says for our body as
[1:27:27] Elmen prepared me the Holy Ghost don't
[1:27:30] dwell in the house it dwells in the
[1:27:32] heart that's the temple the opening of
[1:27:37] the seventh seal points us to the true
[1:27:40] temple of God what is the true temple of
[1:27:42] God milk has a quarter in human flesh
[1:27:45] you realize like I said last night God
[1:27:48] used imperfection in perfect human
[1:27:53] beings ministry to perfect the bride by
[1:27:56] what by the preaching of the perfect
[1:27:58] word not that friends of thing is that
[1:28:01] we look at at ministry as in lot you
[1:28:03] guys but people look at ministries and
[1:28:05] necessary evil but they don't understand
[1:28:07] the order of Melchizedek they don't
[1:28:09] that's why people can miss church and
[1:28:11] don't think nothing of it doesn't mean
[1:28:12] nothing to them thank you just said
[1:28:14] there was just said homeless of the days
[1:28:15] it don't mean nothing you know what
[1:28:16] because they're not only
[1:28:18] my cousin they don't understand the
[1:28:20] order because God is actually building a
[1:28:22] building and the thing is part of
[1:28:24] building that building is come to a
[1:28:26] church and part of the building is
[1:28:28] friends the thing is this building this
[1:28:30] church Billy not this church but human
[1:28:32] bodies church building is going to be
[1:28:34] unmovable and it's unshakeable because
[1:28:36] you know what because they're built on
[1:28:37] under the order of Melchizedek now the
[1:28:40] seventh seal brings him back to earth so
[1:28:45] friends David represent the McKusick or
[1:28:47] priest prophet and King and Melchizedek
[1:28:52] after the slaughter of the Kings what
[1:28:54] did he do with Abraham he served him
[1:28:57] communion amen
[1:29:00] no David also served communion I'm just
[1:29:03] I'm gonna get into something here so
[1:29:05] just stay with me here for a second he
[1:29:07] dwelt every one of them Israel both man
[1:29:09] and woman and to every one a loaf of
[1:29:11] bread and a good piece of flesh and a
[1:29:14] flagon of wine
[1:29:16] so communion in this tabernacle now does
[1:29:21] everybody know what communion is I hope
[1:29:24] you do I believe you do but don't look
[1:29:27] at communion just come to church and
[1:29:29] partaking on the ordinance of communion
[1:29:32] communion because this is under the MAL
[1:29:34] custom order this is what God brought us
[1:29:37] into in this generation this is rare to
[1:29:40] me it's very sacred because it's it's
[1:29:43] something that God has given me
[1:29:44] he says to minyan brother ben is not the
[1:29:48] bread not the wine the communion is
[1:29:51] talking back and forth with God okay
[1:29:56] now listen to me friends because people
[1:29:59] mistake what communion is all about they
[1:30:01] immediately think it's the ordinance
[1:30:02] it's more than that he says now he says
[1:30:05] now we're going to have to mean service
[1:30:07] now we call it to me and but it is a
[1:30:10] commune she mean is to talk to commune
[1:30:14] commune is when we stop and talk to the
[1:30:17] Lord
[1:30:18] communicate
[1:30:20] now this is under the tent this is under
[1:30:23] the tabernacle of David order came out
[1:30:25] doesn't it this is what we've been
[1:30:27] brought into this day some people who
[1:30:29] only have time to pray anymore they're
[1:30:32] too busy maybe I should preach a parrot
[1:30:35] or more but how important prayer is
[1:30:38] friends in your life your communication
[1:30:40] your your your communication line people
[1:30:43] just look at that as an intellectual
[1:30:44] thing that message but it's not
[1:30:46] intellectual it's actually has a purpose
[1:30:48] to it it actually has a communion with
[1:30:50] and actually you're under the order of
[1:30:51] Micah it has a purpose to it he says now
[1:30:55] you do not communal he's because you
[1:30:58] cannot talk back or television but when
[1:31:01] you can buy but when you can buy
[1:31:03] telephone because you can mean one to
[1:31:05] another
[1:31:06] it's just isn't one side I cannot
[1:31:08] commune with you now because you do not
[1:31:10] talk back so therefore it would not be
[1:31:14] coming to hear a minister deliver his
[1:31:16] message so you come to church or tonight
[1:31:18] it's not communion with God because I'm
[1:31:20] only one preacher you're a man of me
[1:31:23] saying Sikkim dog but that's not
[1:31:25] communion he says that would not be
[1:31:27] coming together but do you mean
[1:31:29] communion would not be that if you come
[1:31:31] just like you mean with the minister you
[1:31:32] call him to one side or any individual
[1:31:35] like you mean with him or her but to
[1:31:37] what that would not be coming to
[1:31:43] communion taking communion you need him
[1:31:45] would not be I don't know if he come to
[1:31:48] commune with the ministry come and call
[1:31:49] one side or any individual and can mean
[1:31:52] with him or or she but to what we come
[1:31:55] into communion he says is for each of us
[1:31:58] as individuals can be with Christ that
[1:32:00] is communion
[1:32:01] then communities not all together one
[1:32:03] doing the talking us doing all the
[1:32:04] talking but way and seeing what he says
[1:32:07] back to us miss my friends is important
[1:32:12] this is the order that we've been come
[1:32:15] into this message is not theology to me
[1:32:18] there's a purpose behind this because
[1:32:22] Davis restoration of Davis Tabernacle
[1:32:24] was all about bringing the people close
[1:32:27] to the ark the mercy seat so what so
[1:32:31] they can commune he says now there's
[1:32:33] were many times
[1:32:34] that we get our great mistakes as we do
[1:32:37] all the talking and don't wait and give
[1:32:40] him a chance to answer back we do
[1:32:42] sometimes say Lord I would thought you
[1:32:44] would do so-and-so song so amen
[1:32:47] he says and get up and leave now that
[1:32:49] really isn't Kamini
[1:32:52] he says that's going and asking a favor
[1:32:55] our laundry lists our shopping list
[1:32:59] that's not communion do this Lord do
[1:33:03] he's not our mascot he's our husband
[1:33:08] invisible union of the bra light he says
[1:33:12] but when you stay long enough until he
[1:33:14] answers back that's when you're getting
[1:33:15] to be in communion with the Lord this is
[1:33:20] what Davis tabernacle is talking about
[1:33:23] all these things it is not just coming
[1:33:26] for the Lord and asking favors which a
[1:33:30] lot of people do they get before the
[1:33:32] Lord of all he do is I stated that's not
[1:33:34] what God wants God watched him Union he
[1:33:38] wants you to talk to him and he wants
[1:33:41] you to wait for him to talk back to you
[1:33:42] now this takes time I'm out of time
[1:33:47] brother Jerry well are you in the order
[1:33:49] of Melchizedek what do you been called
[1:33:52] to this day here's a people in this day
[1:33:55] and age we live busy lives we have a
[1:33:58] life outside of church in the sense of
[1:34:00] work and almost of God knows all these
[1:34:03] things God knows our busy people but the
[1:34:06] thing is that to take time to actually
[1:34:09] commune with him it will actually
[1:34:11] restore your spirit even here your human
[1:34:14] spirit gets down see your conscience
[1:34:17] your reason your affection all those
[1:34:18] things that get down sometimes that
[1:34:20] friends the thing is you begin to reason
[1:34:22] with things but God wants you to purge
[1:34:25] these things out of you want you to pur
[1:34:27] some of these things out that we get
[1:34:29] down on because his life gets us down
[1:34:30] he wants to commune with us see friends
[1:34:34] the thing is communion is very important
[1:34:37] he's a communion with the Lord is like
[1:34:39] an oasis in a desert have you ever got
[1:34:43] so thirsty really thirsty and
[1:34:47] drinking water you know friends I can
[1:34:52] sit here and tell you all the
[1:34:53] ingredients of this h2o yer tell you
[1:34:56] about it preach to you talk to you about
[1:34:58] all those things
[1:34:58] it doesn't do nothing for you it only do
[1:35:02] something for me when I take a drink you
[1:35:04] can be sitting there in the bench
[1:35:06] thirsty dry and all those things but
[1:35:09] friends the thing is I'm the one with
[1:35:10] the glass I'm the one with the water I
[1:35:12] take a drink and what does it do it
[1:35:14] quenches my thirst but communion it's
[1:35:18] like an oasis in the desert see friends
[1:35:21] the thing is you might be dry I'm
[1:35:23] talking spiritually though you might be
[1:35:26] oh my my prayer life is one like Oh God
[1:35:29] what is it it's an oasis it coming to me
[1:35:33] with God and also and God begins to
[1:35:35] really talk to you and revive you and
[1:35:37] you're ready to take on the world again
[1:35:39] he knows this world he knows what's
[1:35:41] going on he knows the pressures the
[1:35:44] things that are going on in this life
[1:35:45] but what we do we don't take time enough
[1:35:48] to actually commune with him to
[1:35:50] fellowship with him amen he says it's
[1:35:56] like a spring underneath the pond that
[1:35:59] were the traveler come by stops and
[1:36:01] drinks the water will be he crunches his
[1:36:03] thirst
[1:36:03] that's remembering the Lord coming by
[1:36:05] the order of his top table where the
[1:36:08] passing program that's our journey here
[1:36:09] on the earth with us together that we
[1:36:12] can come by his table and their drink of
[1:36:14] his blessings and of his grace of his
[1:36:16] word and fellowship around his word
[1:36:18] until our thirsty souls are satisfied
[1:36:22] have you ever had that or am i talking
[1:36:25] to people that's never experienced this
[1:36:27] I don't believe that but understand
[1:36:30] friends this is why under this mell
[1:36:32] category we can know all the knowledge
[1:36:34] around it but if I don't take advantage
[1:36:36] of it what God's given us if I don't
[1:36:39] take advantage of what God's actually
[1:36:41] that's part of this is part of my
[1:36:42] inheritance this is part of the things
[1:36:44] that God's given me he says and then we
[1:36:47] leave the place of worship refreshed
[1:36:49] satisfied going out to meet the deserts
[1:36:53] problems again the problems of life's
[1:36:54] desert
[1:36:55] yes an oasis in the desert refreshing
[1:36:57] ourselves making herself
[1:36:59] when we're thirsty community oh I got
[1:37:05] too far because I was I was playing with
[1:37:09] my PowerPoint last night and of course a
[1:37:11] I you know I probably puts a bunch of
[1:37:15] quotes together but understand this
[1:37:16] friends you know under the Seventh Seal
[1:37:21] God made a new and living way for us to
[1:37:25] come in under the bleeding word to come
[1:37:29] in and that have actual communion and
[1:37:31] fellowship with him you know friends in
[1:37:34] the Old Testament Aaron were going
[1:37:37] behind the veil I'm just gonna be
[1:37:39] closing here mmm when Aaron would go in
[1:37:41] behind the veil and all those priests
[1:37:44] that weren't high priests or Levites
[1:37:45] that couldn't go in behind the veil was
[1:37:46] just airing this sons they'd have to
[1:37:49] wait - Aaron comes back out and ask them
[1:37:52] what the experience is like but under
[1:37:56] this new and living way you don't have
[1:37:59] to wait you don't have to wait for
[1:38:01] brother Gerald to get up here and tell
[1:38:03] you what the experience is like you can
[1:38:05] experience it yourself see many times
[1:38:08] people they'll come up to you this is
[1:38:09] what's it like brother Jerry well you
[1:38:11] need to experience it yourself now I can
[1:38:13] tell you a lot of things about you know
[1:38:15] whatever you know maybe okay I worked in
[1:38:17] the oil field I can tell you a lot of
[1:38:19] things about a punk jock and friends are
[1:38:22] they going to 28 and 320 exports doesn't
[1:38:24] mean nothing to you those are sizes of
[1:38:26] pump jacks I didn't tell you all those
[1:38:28] Signet up with the packing I ain't
[1:38:29] talking about the motors 25 50 works but
[1:38:32] all's there doesn't mean nothing to you
[1:38:33] until you would experience it and then
[1:38:36] we can talk and have communion right
[1:38:39] same with God friends that's what he's
[1:38:43] longing for communion with you you might
[1:38:45] say well God's just too great too much
[1:38:47] he is but he wants to commune with his
[1:38:49] wife he wants that fellowship with us he
[1:38:53] wants to be able to come and have that
[1:38:55] that then of the relation that that talk
[1:38:58] with you but friends the thing is we
[1:39:00] don't allow sometimes you know why
[1:39:02] because we think our theology is gonna
[1:39:05] give us by your theology won't get you
[1:39:07] bought you need that communion with the
[1:39:09] Lord
[1:39:10] in order to get by in this life friends
[1:39:13] your si ology your understanding an
[1:39:15] adult you know all those things dolphins
[1:39:17] are fine they're great on board we need
[1:39:18] to understand the right dog there's all
[1:39:20] those things but understand that there's
[1:39:21] more to this message than that there's
[1:39:23] more under than my cousin there's a
[1:39:25] there's a time period where you just
[1:39:27] have communion with the Lord now friends
[1:39:30] watch this it's Psalms 27 verse 6 and we
[1:39:35] know Psalms 27 is actually the rapture
[1:39:38] master's brother brand preaches and we
[1:39:41] understand friends the thing is is that
[1:39:43] under mountains on the tabernacle of
[1:39:45] David brought the talent of the Ark of
[1:39:48] the coming back to to Jerusalem and Mon
[1:39:50] song and the thing is is that what it is
[1:39:53] is that it was trying to find its
[1:39:55] resting place and when when brother
[1:39:57] Brown because this is a strange
[1:39:58] scriptures of brother Branham used when
[1:40:00] he preached in the rapture message to us
[1:40:01] it's not strange humor because are you
[1:40:02] having a good better understanding of it
[1:40:04] but listen what he says here now this is
[1:40:06] under the Melchizedek order he says now
[1:40:09] shall my head be lifted up above my
[1:40:11] enemies around about me
[1:40:12] therefore well I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:40:17] sacrifices of joy I will sing yay I will
[1:40:21] sing praises unto the Lord so in other
[1:40:24] words there's worshiping go there's
[1:40:26] praise there's this is this another
[1:40:29] option is see friends a thing is that
[1:40:30] we're not supposed to be just sitting
[1:40:32] here like lumps on the log this there's
[1:40:35] there's action to this there's praising
[1:40:37] him
[1:40:38] there's worship to all these different
[1:40:39] things friends the thing is there's seen
[1:40:41] come another's Tabernacle and let me
[1:40:43] just say it this way Melchizedek is here
[1:40:45] to serve you communion and our friends
[1:40:50] we've been blessed in this thing we've
[1:40:53] been blessed under the opiate of the
[1:40:54] senses we am blessed in all these things
[1:40:56] because friends are understanding
[1:40:59] sometimes needs to be changed because
[1:41:00] end time evangelism isn't calling the
[1:41:02] masses to the altar that's not what the
[1:41:05] message is all about what it is is a
[1:41:07] molding and molding the character of
[1:41:10] Jesus Christ in our lives
[1:41:12] so when he looks at us he sees his
[1:41:15] character friends the thing is is that
[1:41:18] in order to get his character there's
[1:41:20] gonna be some communion because there's
[1:41:22] got to be some transferring of life
[1:41:23] coming into it but we all need more
[1:41:26] communion alive
[1:41:28] we need more Gunnar we not agree
[1:41:31] transmissible life is just getting so
[1:41:33] busy you know technology let's go on the
[1:41:36] Internet's the way it's going friends
[1:41:37] the thing is it takes you up to it you
[1:41:39] go on YouTube you could might be looking
[1:41:40] at something you know not bad or
[1:41:42] anything sinful but also in your look at
[1:41:43] this two hours later what is it just ate
[1:41:46] your time up can I have that time for
[1:41:48] prayer the time you don't just just have
[1:41:50] communion with God but friends the thing
[1:41:51] is just so many things eating their time
[1:41:53] up now you know uh God no one was just
[1:41:57] you know that we have to provide for her
[1:41:59] family's God knows all these things
[1:42:00] he'll make provision for the whole
[1:42:02] things but friends he still wants
[1:42:04] Communion and that's under the order of
[1:42:06] Melchizedek that's under what we've been
[1:42:09] called to in this day and age this is
[1:42:11] the bride of Jesus Christ this is for us
[1:42:15] because I count myself a part of that
[1:42:18] you count yourself a part of that amen
[1:42:23] let's stand hallelujah I hope I didn't
[1:42:30] rush it through I hope you got what I
[1:42:33] was actually trying to convey because
[1:42:36] the thing is friends it's important to
[1:42:38] us what we understand about what we've
[1:42:42] been called to in this day and age I
[1:42:44] haven't been just called to another
[1:42:46] religion it's not a ritualistic form
[1:42:51] that we're taking on here tonight
[1:42:52] you can do many things like the
[1:42:54] Pharisees could do they could take on
[1:42:56] the religion of the law but they could
[1:42:59] never take on the life I want to take on
[1:43:02] the life I want to have Christ working
[1:43:06] out of me Christ isn't something that
[1:43:09] friends we set aside it's something
[1:43:12] living out of you that's why many times
[1:43:14] that's why they can never understand
[1:43:15] Jesus when Jesus came on the scene
[1:43:18] the Pharisees looked down further and
[1:43:20] they said you're the devil
[1:43:22] why why why they say the devil here's
[1:43:24] the very thing that they're waiting for
[1:43:26] because they built an image in their
[1:43:30] minds of what Christ was supposed to be
[1:43:31] like and they looked at that and didn't
[1:43:33] compare to their image
[1:43:34] you know things same things happening
[1:43:36] today you know in the message of the
[1:43:38] hour people are building images again in
[1:43:41] their minds and not recognizing that the
[1:43:45] bride has taken the word and taken flesh
[1:43:48] the word has taken flesh in the bride
[1:43:50] they don't recognize that they recognize
[1:43:53] the theology the RET recognize the
[1:43:55] dachshund recognize a lot of things but
[1:43:57] they do not recognize that the bride
[1:43:59] Zach she's been veiled by the word Amen
[1:44:04] I said word prayer Father in heaven
[1:44:05] gracious Holy Spirit merciful God how
[1:44:09] wonderful you are to us old Jesus I pray

[1:48:56] services or I said maybe I said brother

[1:51:16] to this and break it down to that you
[1:51:18] know and so that you know just just

[1:51:35] man by the grace of Almighty God and
[1:51:39] it's true again what we've heard tonight
[1:51:41] the part of God say that when the
[1:51:44] ministries or whether it's the pastor
[1:51:46] and the other ministers standing there
[1:51:47] in the pulpit he said he's the angel of
[1:51:50] God to you a man it's the angel of God
[1:51:53] bringing forth the word that you needed
[1:51:55] to hear tonight praise the name of the
[1:51:57] Lord it was good and I was singing at
[1:52:01] and I just just quickly and I was
[1:52:04] shocked that he studying that he
[1:52:06] finished and I was hoping that he go on
[1:52:08] for at least another hour so maybe he's
[1:52:13] going to do that tomorrow happy man
[1:52:15] because we the clock goes back to night
[1:52:17] though so we got an extra hour

[1:52:23] that extra anointing tomorrow amen
[1:52:26] but it's Jesus here now that's good a
[1:52:29] man many don't know it and many do take
[1:52:33] it lately amen brother Jerry you're
[1:52:35] right that was the truth many are taking
[1:52:38] it too lately they die they're not into
[1:52:41] the enthusiasm that they worry and at
[1:52:44] least I can go back to 51 years ago when
[1:52:48] I first came to this word in this
[1:52:50] message and the people had that hunger
[1:52:53] thirst enthusiasm for the word the
[1:52:56] things of God the mystery of God and
[1:52:58] worse
[1:52:58] chipton worshiped and worship a man and
[1:53:01] they can and again they couldn't wait
[1:53:03] for those doors to open a maid that
[1:53:06] couldn't wait for whether whether there
[1:53:07] was a church or whether it was the
[1:53:09] cottage mean they just couldn't wait
[1:53:10] they were looking forward to it
[1:53:12] constantly for the hearing of the word
[1:53:13] sometimes there was a ministering
[1:53:15] brother sometimes just the tape of the
[1:53:18] prophet but brother I'd say to the
[1:53:20] estate they didn't take it lightly but
[1:53:22] as time goes on there's more and more
[1:53:25] taking it lightly more and more just
[1:53:27] becoming religious in the end our
[1:53:30] brother brought all that out tonight and
[1:53:32] I trust you heard it and I trust that
[1:53:33] you're gonna put your foot you put us on
[1:53:35] our toes so that we're not going to be
[1:53:37] guilty of it Amen we're not gonna be
[1:53:40] guilty of losing the hunger the force
[1:53:43] for the things of God and just taking it
[1:53:45] lately no no no no break grace of God to
[1:53:49] us brother
[1:53:50] that is that is not not like taking
[1:53:53] lightly as it's light and it's life to
[1:53:56] the Bride of Christ by the grace of
[1:53:58] Almighty God and again either brother
[1:54:03] brought it out but word about worshiping
[1:54:05] in vain for a form of worship and he
[1:54:08] said dead works amen I think the Holy
[1:54:12] Ghost bring it to your remembrance what
[1:54:14] our brother has minister concerning
[1:54:16] these things tonight because many have
[1:54:19] gone from the Holy Ghost worship to a
[1:54:21] form of worship and the boat of gods and
[1:54:24] it's all out of the head but not the
[1:54:26] heart
[1:54:26] Holy Ghost verse that comes out of the
[1:54:29] heart by the grace of Almighty God a man
[1:54:32] dead works and it's in vain he brought
[1:54:37] the scripture out in vain do they
[1:54:39] worship Me
[1:54:41] grace to us brother there were not
[1:54:45] worshiping out of our heads but were
[1:54:47] worshiping out of our hearts amen and
[1:54:50] living we're living not acting out the
[1:54:54] word the Pharisees were actors and the
[1:54:59] scribes they were actors and there was a
[1:55:02] lot of actors around the message they're
[1:55:04] acting it out but there's a bride there
[1:55:07] are the elect the chosen that are living
[1:55:10] it out
[1:55:11] they are the message living it night
[1:55:14] morning noon and night day and day and
[1:55:16] day out you want to if they want to
[1:55:19] listen goddess you're gonna judge the
[1:55:21] world and it's going to be the life you
[1:55:24] live Oh Oh Lord as I preach in our
[1:55:28] sister Burns's shooter some years ago I
[1:55:32] said I said they're going to say oh well
[1:55:34] I didn't see this I didn't know this and
[1:55:36] I said but God is going to come back to
[1:55:38] that person and say listen I was made
[1:55:40] flesh in Julia Barnes and I live next
[1:55:42] door to you I was little I was made
[1:55:45] flesh and Julie burns and I and I lived
[1:55:47] it I lived in middle gamble and that was
[1:55:51] me that wasn't her amen
[1:55:55] and then they they could see in her a
[1:55:57] different life a different attitude amen
[1:56:00] you know even in our brother Burns and I
[1:56:03] trust that it can be said of you tonight
[1:56:05] and me tonight through the hearing of
[1:56:07] this word it will confirm that we are
[1:56:11] the Word made flesh
[1:56:13] amen and got a point to you and say
[1:56:16] there I was I lived in that person I was
[1:56:19] made flesh in that person a man by the
[1:56:22] grace of Almighty God is wonderful
[1:56:25] amen and again that's true as our
[1:56:30] brother Jerry brought out God doesn't
[1:56:31] weaken our ignorance because now the
[1:56:34] whole truth is revealed we are without
[1:56:38] excuse that's the truth the whole truth
[1:56:42] nothing but the truth had been revealed
[1:56:43] as I brought it out just recently there
[1:56:46] was no ministry in this hour in this age
[1:56:49] like William Branham he was a man that
[1:56:52] had they god had a plan for his ministry
[1:56:55] others made made their own planes but
[1:56:59] God had a plan for his because it was to
[1:57:01] the bride this is wonderful thank God
[1:57:05] that it wasn't a man-made ministry but
[1:57:09] was it was there was prophecy fulfilled
[1:57:11] for in this day and in this hour so
[1:57:16] brothers sisters don't think God's going
[1:57:17] to wink at this and we get that because
[1:57:19] God's going to require the truth
[1:57:22] manifested in our flesh
[1:57:24] I like what our brother is bringing out
[1:57:26] concerning milk isn't it good
[1:57:28] oh my praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:57:33] Melchizedek brother is a mystery to the
[1:57:36] people back in Abraham's day Melchizedek
[1:57:39] is a mystery to them today but not to
[1:57:42] the bride praise the name of the Lord
[1:57:45] because he was that mighty angel
[1:57:48] descending for the opening of the seals
[1:57:49] oh did you hear it revealing the
[1:57:54] Melchizedek order of the word that's
[1:57:57] good
[1:57:57] amen thank God for brother Jerry fury a
[1:58:04] man not furry a man he come with the
[1:58:12] word if it's furious of the people think
