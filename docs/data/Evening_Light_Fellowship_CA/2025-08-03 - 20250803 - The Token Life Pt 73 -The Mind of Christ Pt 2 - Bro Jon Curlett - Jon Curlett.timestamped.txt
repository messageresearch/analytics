[43:35] Lord, our desire is that they would see
[43:37] you in us.
[43:40] Lord that through the flaws and the
[43:42] failures, the mistakes, the missteps.
[43:46] Lord, that through the imperfection, yet
[43:48] they could see Christ.
[43:50] Lord, that portion that you've given to
[43:52] each one of us, that light that you've
[43:53] given to each one of us, that life that
[43:55] you've given to each one of us, Lord, if
[43:57] we could just humble ourselves and set
[43:58] ourselves aside, Lord, that they could
[44:00] see you. Lord, it's all we have to offer
[44:03] today is Christ.
[44:05] Lord, we don't have a lifestyle. We
[44:07] don't have a community. We don't have a
[44:08] religion, Lord. All we have is you,
[44:11] Lord. And if they can come to a place to
[44:12] accept you, it'll take care of all of
[44:14] those other things, heavenly father. So
[44:16] Lord, we're asking you to make us a
[44:18] witness, Lord. That as we've sung this
[44:20] song, Lord, it would be a reality in our
[44:22] life, Lord. That the very life of Christ
[44:24] would produce its word in our lives,
[44:27] that people could see it, Lord. That we
[44:28] would be a city on a hill, Lord. A light
[44:30] that cannot be hidden. Lord, that your
[44:33] word would show through your bride in
[44:35] this age. Lord, we know you promised it.
[44:38] Lord, we're trusting we're the ones to
[44:39] do it. Lord, grant us grace day by day.
[44:42] Lord, let our lives, let our decisions,
[44:44] our words, Lord, the way we spend our
[44:46] time, Lord, made it all reflect the
[44:48] idea, Lord, that it's Christ in us, the
[44:50] hope of glory that has control. Lord,
[44:52] bless us now again through your word. We
[44:54] pray, Lord, take these thoughts, Lord,
[44:57] this simple message, Lord. May you
[44:59] magnify it in our lives into a great
[45:01] reality. We pray
[45:03] Lord bless those that are not here
[45:05] today. Those that are traveling on
[45:07] vacation Lord, Brother Matt and his
[45:08] family, Brother Kingsley and his family,
[45:10] Lord. Pray in your traveling mercies to
[45:12] them, Lord, that you would just give
[45:13] them a rest, Lord, a relaxation, Lord.
[45:15] May you bless them and make them a
[45:17] blessing each one. We pray, Lord. And
[45:19] those that are gathered here, Lord, may
[45:20] we be blessed, Lord, to be in your
[45:22] presence, Lord. For we ask these things
[45:24] now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[45:27] God bless you. Turn to Matthew chapter 5
[45:29] this morning if you would. Matthew 5.
[45:31] Good to see everyone here on this
[45:33] beautiful sunny Sunday.
[45:36] Now, we don't believe in
[45:38] in uh luck or chance or whatever and you
[45:43] know putting a
[45:46] making things go away because we talk
[45:48] about them. But I did look at the
[45:49] forecast and for the next eight days it
[45:50] is sunshine, sunshine, sunshine and 20°
[45:54] plus every single day. So, we say praise
[45:56] the Lord for that. Amen. We're getting
[45:58] our two weeks of summer it seems like.
[46:00] But it's certainly wonderful to be here.
[46:02] See each one that's here this morning.
[46:04] Amen. We want to remember brother the
[46:06] family of brother Albert Snow,
[46:08] particularly sister Freda today. We
[46:10] don't have firm funeral details yet.
[46:13] We're waiting for confirmation from the
[46:15] family specifically on what they they're
[46:17] going to do and if that will uh require
[46:19] us to be there or not. But uh in the
[46:22] meantime, please remember Sister Freda
[46:23] and the family especially. Certainly
[46:25] appreciate that special today, Sister
[46:26] Priscilla. That was wonderful. very much
[46:28] in line with what we're preaching on. I
[46:31] wanted to thank brother Vichel and
[46:32] sister Selena. They've been on
[46:34] audiovisisual duty constantly while
[46:36] brother Matt's gone with the the rest of
[46:38] the ones back there. So I I just
[46:40] remembered there today because Selena
[46:41] keeps leaving early and it's not usual.
[46:44] Usually it's only a couple services in a
[46:45] row. But I want to say God bless you for
[46:46] that for your your faithful service.
[46:48] Amen. We certainly appreciate that.
[46:50] Matthew 5:6 just one verse. It says,
[46:53] "Blessed are they which do hunger and
[46:55] thirst after righteousness, for they
[46:57] shall be filled." Amen. God bless you.
[46:59] You can have your seats. And we're
[47:01] continuing our thought that we started
[47:02] on Wednesday night on the mind of
[47:04] Christ. And I do want to say if you
[47:05] weren't there, please go back and listen
[47:07] to that service. If your kids weren't
[47:09] there, sit with your kids and listen to
[47:11] it. It was a message for the local
[47:13] church. It's been a while coming. Amen.
[47:15] And and we needed to hear it. Amen. I'm
[47:17] responsible to preach it and you're
[47:19] responsible to hear it. And so I'll just
[47:21] leave it there and say if you weren't
[47:22] here, please go back and listen to it
[47:24] with your family. But we spoke last
[47:26] service, we started this thought on the
[47:27] mind of Christ and how it's so key to
[47:30] the to the believer today. But we showed
[47:32] that you can't have the mind of Christ
[47:33] without the spirit of Christ. And we
[47:35] remember how those people are going to
[47:37] come in that in that white throne
[47:38] judgment. They're going to say, "Hey, we
[47:39] did a lot of wonderful things." And
[47:41] he'll say, "I never knew you." See, they
[47:42] thought they had the mind of Christ, but
[47:44] because they lacked the spirit of
[47:45] Christ, their direction was all wrong.
[47:47] It wasn't that they didn't do good
[47:48] things. It wasn't that they didn't do
[47:49] wonderful things. It wasn't that they
[47:51] didn't do signs and wonders, but they
[47:52] didn't catch the mind of God. They
[47:54] didn't catch the will of God. And so,
[47:56] they went and they did their own thing.
[47:58] And we talked about how when Christ was
[48:00] baptized, the spirit of God filled him
[48:02] completely. And that's when his ministry
[48:03] started. It's good to see Sister Si Elsa
[48:05] and Sister Mary Beth up front again.
[48:07] Amen. It's it's our little cheer section
[48:09] up front. We appreciate that. Amen. We
[48:12] miss it. Amen. It's good to see these
[48:14] young people. I was I was we watched you
[48:17] know my son Jonathan's back in in BC at
[48:20] the camp there and I was so happy to see
[48:21] him on the front row on the front row
[48:24] early. That's the way we want it to be.
[48:26] Amen. We want our kids to understand
[48:28] what it means to be in church and to
[48:30] enjoy it and to partake of it and be a
[48:32] part of it. So God bless you our two
[48:34] young sisters up front that are that are
[48:36] that are bravely sitting in the spit
[48:37] zone. Amen. God bless you each one as
[48:39] you sit next to brother Mark and sister
[48:41] Moren who are always brave and sitting
[48:43] up front. Amen. But we when Christ came
[48:46] remember it was Jesus of Nazareth that
[48:48] came to the river Jordan. It brought him
[48:51] to the word of the day which was John
[48:52] the Baptist and he had to be baptized
[48:54] and then the spirit of God filled him
[48:56] completely and that's when his ministry
[48:58] started because that's when God stepped
[49:00] into flesh and started showing himself
[49:01] and we see that it was the spirit of God
[49:04] that gave him the mind of God and then
[49:06] it was the spirit of God that gave him
[49:07] the wisdom the understanding the
[49:09] knowledge of what he was supposed to do.
[49:11] And we read this quote last service but
[49:13] I want to take it as a starting point.
[49:14] He says there's only one thing that
[49:16] never did begin and that was God. He
[49:18] says, "Therefore, the only way we can
[49:20] ever live eternally is to have God's own
[49:23] life in us, and that's eternal life."
[49:26] God separated himself among us and gave
[49:28] his spirit like he did on Pentecost. And
[49:31] it was seen in symbols of fire from the
[49:33] pillar of fire that separated itself
[49:36] amongst the people. The identity of God
[49:38] was in that pillar of fire. Remember,
[49:39] when you saw the pillar of fire, you saw
[49:41] God. That's the way that it worked. Now,
[49:43] what does he do? He comes down and it
[49:45] it's just a symbolism. And all he's
[49:47] doing is he's saying, "Listen, I'm going
[49:48] to take myself and I'm going to
[49:50] distribute myself amongst the people."
[49:53] Remember, we preached before that the
[49:54] service on it that that the the the rock
[49:56] that the church is built on is the
[49:58] revelation of Jesus Christ. And what you
[50:02] have to see is that the revelation of
[50:04] Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago is not what
[50:07] you're looking for today. Because that
[50:09] was a man, that was a ministry for 30,
[50:11] really three and a half years, but a
[50:13] life of 33 and 1/2 years. But that body
[50:16] went away, but Christ never left. And so
[50:19] it's the continued revealing of Christ.
[50:21] And on the day of Pentecost in symbol
[50:23] form, what was it? That pillar of fire
[50:25] came down and shifted himself into
[50:28] people. And so Christ stepped into flesh
[50:32] all over again. And the question is,
[50:34] would anybody recognize it?
[50:36] Mighty God unveiled before us. But
[50:39] because it's in parts and parcels,
[50:41] people don't tend to understand it. But
[50:43] he's saying here what happened down here
[50:45] is he came down and he separated himself
[50:47] amongst the people. He said to give his
[50:50] own life out to the people. And then he
[50:52] says and through this through this life
[50:54] through the spirit of God the mind of
[50:57] Christ should be should be operating
[51:01] amongst us. He says it should be
[51:03] operating amongst us. The question is is
[51:05] it operating amongst us? Is the mind of
[51:08] Christ operating through the believers?
[51:11] Well, there's a simple test. And again,
[51:13] I'm just quickly refreshing our thoughts
[51:15] for those that weren't here on
[51:16] Wednesday, that there's a simple test to
[51:18] see if the mind of Christ is in us.
[51:20] Because Paul says, "Let this mind be in
[51:22] you, which was also in Christ Jesus."
[51:25] Not a similar mind, not a part of a
[51:27] mind, but the exact same mind that was
[51:29] in him. Let it be in you. That means
[51:32] it's available and it's required.
[51:36] We can't sit here and say, "Well, I
[51:37] don't know, brother John." No, there's a
[51:39] mind of Christ that's available to the
[51:41] believer today. He says, who being in
[51:44] the form of God, what happened on the
[51:46] day of Pentecost? The fire of God, the
[51:49] life of God, the spirit of God came down
[51:50] in men. And what did it do, church? It
[51:53] turned them into a form of God.
[51:57] This is where we're going. That'll be
[51:58] the apex of this series. The form of
[52:01] God.
[52:02] Amen. who said, "Being in the form of
[52:05] God, thought it not robbery to be equal
[52:07] with God." But catch the mind now
[52:10] because he says, "He made himself of no
[52:13] reputation and took upon him the form of
[52:17] a servant and was made in the likeness
[52:19] of man." That that thing that says he
[52:21] made himself of no reputation, the
[52:23] literal translation is he emptied
[52:25] himself. He took everything that he
[52:28] could have wanted, everything he could
[52:30] have been, every personal will, every
[52:32] personal thought, every personal idea,
[52:34] and like a bucket, he dumped it out, and
[52:37] he made himself something that he didn't
[52:39] have to be. He made himself a servant.
[52:44] He says he made himself of no
[52:46] reputation. Amen. He wrapped himself in
[52:49] the role of a servant. and being found
[52:51] in fashion to a man, he humbled himself
[52:54] and became obedient unto death, even the
[52:58] death of the cross. So he settled
[53:00] himself to the word. He humbled himself
[53:03] to the word. He humbled himself to what
[53:05] the word said he had to be and what he
[53:07] had to do. And that became his only
[53:10] purpose.
[53:12] You know, it's amazing today. The first
[53:13] thing that you see, somebody gets a
[53:15] gift, somebody gets a ministry, what do
[53:16] they want to be? They want to be the
[53:19] master.
[53:20] They want to be the master. They want to
[53:22] be recognized. They want to be put on a
[53:24] pedestal. They want to be called apostle
[53:26] or or or or or chief this or or pope or
[53:30] you know whatever it might be. They want
[53:32] some big title. They want some big
[53:33] position to raise them up. The mind of
[53:35] Christ puts you at the bottom of the
[53:38] ladder and says, "How can I help you up,
[53:40] good sir? Help me up. Let me help you
[53:42] up, brother. Let me help you up, sister.
[53:44] let me stay right here and work with you
[53:47] rather than stand above you and benefit
[53:49] from you. Amen. That's the mind of
[53:51] Christ that we're talking about tonight.
[53:53] And we see here that the the mind of
[53:55] Christ showed him who he was. But when
[53:58] it showed him who he was, it placed him
[54:00] in his word position. It placed him in
[54:04] his word position. Now remember in the
[54:05] scripture, there's three major
[54:07] comingings of Christ. And the first was
[54:09] in human flesh in a man called Jesus of
[54:12] Nazareth 2,000 years ago. And that was a
[54:14] visible God. That was an obvious God in
[54:17] man. But the second one is the one that
[54:19] we're going through right now. And we'll
[54:21] see as we go through this the rest of
[54:22] this series. The only Christ that people
[54:25] will see is through you and I.
[54:28] That's the only thing. Amen. Because the
[54:31] the the Christ is coming only for his
[54:34] bride in the second coming. And he won't
[54:36] be seen by everyone at this time. He
[54:38] never puts his feet on the earth. We
[54:40] meet him in the air. There is no visible
[54:43] man for them to see. There's an
[54:45] invisible union going on right now
[54:47] between husband and wife. And we're
[54:49] caught up together and it's only the
[54:51] bride and the groom in the chamber.
[54:54] Nobody else is invited. It's a sick
[54:56] world today where they're inviting their
[54:58] bedrooms into the church.
[55:01] But Christ is not like that. It's not a
[55:03] public show. It's a tentive meeting.
[55:06] It's a place where it's just you and the
[55:08] bridegroom there. Amen. but he doesn't
[55:10] declare himself visibly to the world the
[55:12] way he did 2,000 years ago. And the
[55:14] problem today is that they're looking
[55:16] for him to come back on a white horse.
[55:18] And he's not coming back on a white
[55:19] horse until the tribulation.
[55:21] That's the third coming where everyone
[55:23] will see him and every knee will bow and
[55:25] every tongue will confess that he's
[55:27] Lord. But we're here to preach you into
[55:29] the second coming. In the coming where
[55:31] nobody else will see him but the bride.
[55:33] Because that's the secret catching away
[55:35] of the bride. Amen. The next time Christ
[55:37] comes after this is with 10,000 times
[55:39] 10,000 of his saints and he's coming
[55:42] with judgment. We're preaching mercy
[55:45] today. We're preaching mercy and grace
[55:47] today. Amen. And if you see him coming
[55:49] with 10,000 by 10,000 of his saints,
[55:50] it's too late. You're already judged. By
[55:53] then it's he that is filthy. Let him be
[55:55] filthy still. And let him that is holy
[55:56] be holy still. The the mercy blood is
[55:59] gone. The blood's off the mercy seat.
[56:00] It's a judgment seat. And you are what
[56:02] you are. And now you're casting yourself
[56:04] under your works. And I don't know about
[56:06] you. I don't want to stand before God
[56:07] based on my works. I want to stand based
[56:10] on his works. That's where I want to
[56:12] stand. Amen. But Jesus of Nazareth was
[56:14] the revealing of God 2,000 years ago,
[56:16] filled with the spirit. God stepped into
[56:19] man completely. But in that role and in
[56:22] that season, God didn't place him into
[56:24] this total power and authority to make
[56:27] everyone bow down to him. Because that
[56:29] wasn't his role for the word of that
[56:31] time. His role was to be a mediator. It
[56:33] was to be a sacrifice. It was to be a
[56:35] lamb of God. It was to be a high priest
[56:38] to intercede for us, to die for us. And
[56:41] it was a servant role, not a lord role.
[56:45] Remember on the in the last supper, he
[56:47] said, "If I, your lord and master, have
[56:49] done this unto you, so ought you to do
[56:51] one to another."
[56:53] Even before he's about to go to the
[56:54] cross, as he says, I am your master. I
[56:57] am your lord. But look how I act. You
[57:00] want a simple test. Does somebody have
[57:02] the mind and spirit of Christ? Are they
[57:04] serving or are they being served?
[57:07] Amen. Because we are servants. We are
[57:10] servants one to another. We humble
[57:12] ourselves one to another. The spirit of
[57:14] God in him gave him the mind to wait on
[57:16] God to seek out the things of God. And
[57:19] that spirit led him to fulfill the word
[57:21] that was written about him for that
[57:24] season. Amen. And we remember how we
[57:25] said that Jesus came to John and John
[57:28] said, "Listen, I I shouldn't baptize
[57:29] you. You should baptize me." And Jesus
[57:31] said, "No, we have to fulfill all
[57:34] righteousness." And we see that that
[57:36] meant he had to fulfill the word that
[57:39] was written about him. He had to be
[57:41] washed because he was coming as the high
[57:43] priest for our infirmities. He was
[57:45] coming as the atonement for us. And so
[57:47] he had to be washed before he could
[57:50] enter into his word position. Amen. And
[57:52] I want you to see that the mind of
[57:54] Christ always does one thing. It takes
[57:57] you into the word for your day. Your
[58:00] day.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Your day. Amen. Church. If we are only
[58:03] worshiping a Christ of 2,000 years ago,
[58:06] we miss the continued revelation of
[58:08] Christ in his people, in you and in I.
[58:11] And as his word is unfolded to bring us
[58:13] to the fullness, the fullness of what
[58:16] he's been talking about. Amen. We're
[58:17] called to overcome in this age. And the
[58:19] mind of Christ will take you into the
[58:21] overcoming position to stand the test to
[58:25] stay with the word for your day. Amen.
[58:27] That's the battle we've heard about,
[58:28] we've preached about so many times is in
[58:30] the mind. And the mind is that gateway
[58:32] between the soul and the spirit. And if
[58:36] your mind says, "I'll accept the word,"
[58:38] then it can go out of your soul and into
[58:40] your life and start to produce itself.
[58:42] But as long as that mind refuses to
[58:43] accept it, there's a barrier to that to
[58:45] that soul having power, that spirit of
[58:47] God and you having power. Amen. It's a
[58:50] battle of the mind because we don't want
[58:52] to be rejected. Listen, anybody here
[58:54] enjoy offending people? Don't raise your
[58:56] hand.
[59:00] If we enjoy offending, then there's a
[59:02] different spirit that's gotten into us.
[59:04] I heard a brother say one time, he said,
[59:06] a brother was preaching hard to his
[59:07] church. He says, "It's okay to preach
[59:08] hard." He says, "It's not okay to enjoy
[59:10] it." I thought that was well said. Amen.
[59:13] We can't have fun rebuking people,
[59:18] tearing people down. One, we shouldn't
[59:20] be tearing them down. Our prophet told
[59:22] us, he says, "Add to what they have. If
[59:24] they have any truth, build on what they
[59:25] have. If they have none, it's a little
[59:27] harder, isn't it? But you have to add to
[59:29] those things. Amen. But but it's so it's
[59:32] so difficult so many times to tell
[59:34] people the truth in love with grace and
[59:39] then take the results that come out of
[59:40] it because it's not often very good.
[59:42] It's not often very good. Amen. It seems
[59:45] so often that we want to have clear
[59:46] logic and reason for everything that we
[59:48] do. And guess what? That is not the way
[59:50] of the believer. It's not the way of the
[59:53] believer. The scripture says um uh
[59:55] there's a way that seemth right unto the
[59:56] man and the end thereof are the ways not
[1:00:03] ways in other words the ways of death
[1:00:06] there everything you think about leads
[1:00:08] to death leads to destruction it leads
[1:00:10] to failure amen we can't save ourselves
[1:00:12] by cold logic or or or or solid
[1:00:14] reasoning listen to this he says we read
[1:00:17] this before he says because remember you
[1:00:19] can't have the mind of Christ and the
[1:00:21] mind of the world at the same time. You
[1:00:24] can't be in your way and God's way at
[1:00:26] the same time. You have to get out of
[1:00:28] your own way to let God have his way.
[1:00:30] That's the only way you're ever going to
[1:00:32] do anything. You got to get away from
[1:00:34] your own thoughts, your own reasons.
[1:00:36] Don't try to reason. Just believe.
[1:00:40] Because the word doesn't make logical
[1:00:42] sense. Many times you look at some of
[1:00:44] the most wonderful things that happen in
[1:00:45] scriptures and you see the results.
[1:00:48] Jesus takes and spits into mud and puts
[1:00:50] it on a man's eyes and then his eyes are
[1:00:51] healed. That makes no sense. That's some
[1:00:54] kind of mud and some kind of spit. I'm
[1:00:55] telling you, right? It doesn't have to
[1:00:59] make sense. But what it does require is
[1:01:02] faith. And that is our walk is faith in
[1:01:04] the word to hold fast no matter what. No
[1:01:07] matter what happens. Amen. The thing is
[1:01:09] we can't be flipping back and forth. And
[1:01:12] that's the battle today. That's the
[1:01:14] lukewarmness that it we've been
[1:01:15] preaching about is flipping back and
[1:01:18] forth. God's way, my way, God's way, my
[1:01:21] way, God's way. my way, my way. Or even
[1:01:23] worse, church, I'd rather you did it all
[1:01:25] your way or all God's way. Cuz when you
[1:01:27] blend the two, you know what happens?
[1:01:29] There's enough of God that's dragged
[1:01:31] into it that when it goes sideways, it
[1:01:33] brings a reproach on the gospel.
[1:01:36] And people will look at that, people
[1:01:37] that aren't believers, people that are
[1:01:39] watching your life, and they are
[1:01:40] watching. They are watching, and they
[1:01:42] say, "Hm, that's weird." They say
[1:01:45] they're a Christian, but they're getting
[1:01:46] the same results I do. Why? Because we
[1:01:49] blended our way and his way.
[1:01:51] It doesn't work. Pick yours or pick his.
[1:01:54] Don't blend. It just brings a reproach
[1:01:57] on Christ. But I want to share a story
[1:01:59] with you this morning if if that'll be
[1:02:00] okay. Because I've witnessed to people
[1:02:02] at work a fair bit. And you know, and
[1:02:05] it's not always about the Bible. In
[1:02:07] fact, it's rarely about the Bible, if I
[1:02:09] could put it that way, about Christ. And
[1:02:11] I'll tell you why that is in a moment.
[1:02:13] But I want you to understand this that
[1:02:15] what I'm looking for is people to hunger
[1:02:17] after what I have.
[1:02:20] Not just based on what I say it comes
[1:02:22] from. We want them to hunger for what we
[1:02:25] have. It's the bait. Your life is the
[1:02:28] bait on the gospel hook. It's the thing
[1:02:32] that people say and they say, "I like
[1:02:34] your results." And so when I talk to
[1:02:37] people, I don't always go and say,
[1:02:38] "Well, James 3 says this or Revelations
[1:02:41] 10 says this or or Matthew 5:6 says
[1:02:44] this." No, I don't say that. What I do
[1:02:46] is I'm talking to them about what the
[1:02:48] word has done in my life without telling
[1:02:51] them first of all that the word has
[1:02:52] necessarily done it. Now most of them
[1:02:54] know I'm a Christian. Most of them know
[1:02:56] I'm a preacher or pastor these different
[1:02:57] things. And so some of them have come to
[1:03:00] me with questions and I've even
[1:03:01] counseledled people at work in these
[1:03:02] different things. But what amazes me
[1:03:04] time and time again is that people want
[1:03:07] to stay where they are and be affirmed
[1:03:09] in their decisions.
[1:03:12] They don't want help. They want
[1:03:14] assurance that they're doing the right
[1:03:15] thing. Amen. And they want to insist
[1:03:19] that they're right even when the results
[1:03:20] are wrong. And I had a a colleague
[1:03:22] talking about his two kids. He's got a a
[1:03:26] a son and a daughter. And his son
[1:03:28] doesn't really care for technology or
[1:03:30] screens. He's he's got a good balance in
[1:03:31] it. He's not on his phone very much.
[1:03:33] He's not on his computer all the time,
[1:03:34] these different things. But his daughter
[1:03:36] is constantly on her phone.
[1:03:39] And and I've talked to them extensively
[1:03:41] in the past about how we raise our kids
[1:03:44] and how we protect our children with
[1:03:45] boundaries.
[1:03:47] Amen. We teach them how to discipline
[1:03:49] themselves. How to protect themselves
[1:03:51] from themselves. That's what we're
[1:03:54] trying to do. We as a species, as
[1:03:56] humans, we're prone to entertainment and
[1:03:58] luxury and ease of life and fun and
[1:04:01] enjoyment. And you give a child
[1:04:02] unlimited access to those things, they
[1:04:05] will destroy themselves with it. 100%
[1:04:08] they will. They can't save themselves
[1:04:09] from it. And in a previous conversation,
[1:04:12] I I'd said to him, I said, "Listen, you
[1:04:14] know, this is how we do it." He says,
[1:04:15] "Well, I don't want to force my
[1:04:17] children." He says, "I don't want to put
[1:04:19] them in a box. I don't I want them to
[1:04:22] make their own decisions, and I trust
[1:04:23] them to make the wrong the right
[1:04:25] decisions." I said, "That's where we
[1:04:26] differ." I says, "I don't trust them to
[1:04:28] make the right decisions." I said,
[1:04:30] "That's why I'm teaching them. That's
[1:04:32] why I'm disciplining them so they can
[1:04:34] see the benefits of proper use. so that
[1:04:38] when the time comes that they have to
[1:04:39] make their own decision, hopefully
[1:04:41] they've learned the lesson and they'll
[1:04:43] go the right path rather than falling
[1:04:45] into the trap. Well, church, now he's
[1:04:48] complaining
[1:04:50] because he's got one kid that's doing
[1:04:51] well and one kid that's not doing well.
[1:04:54] And I said, "Well, this is what we've
[1:04:56] done with our kids. I've got two kids
[1:04:57] with phones." I said, "They got them
[1:04:59] when they had need of them, not because
[1:05:01] other kids had them, not because they
[1:05:02] wanted them. But for Selena, we got her
[1:05:04] a phone because she was down and working
[1:05:06] with horses and she had to let us know
[1:05:08] when she was ready to be picked up. She
[1:05:10] needed a phone. And that phone was
[1:05:12] locked down otherwise. She didn't just
[1:05:14] get to sit on it all the time. And then
[1:05:16] for my son Jonathan, he got one when he
[1:05:18] started to need it for business because
[1:05:20] he was constantly on our phones and our
[1:05:22] computers. So when he needed that, he
[1:05:24] had it. But guess what? It's locked down
[1:05:26] as well. He doesn't have unfettered
[1:05:28] access to everything. And I said, "This
[1:05:30] is what we did and this is why we did
[1:05:32] it."
[1:05:34] And somebody had somebody piped up and
[1:05:36] said, "John, you're doing a great job
[1:05:38] with your kids." And I thank the Lord
[1:05:40] for that. Keep it up, Selena.
[1:05:44] No pressure.
[1:05:46] But it's only God's grace. It's only
[1:05:49] God's grace that we have a truth that
[1:05:50] allows us to raise our children in the
[1:05:52] fear and admonition of the Lord
[1:05:54] according to his word, not according to
[1:05:57] what society thinks is right.
[1:05:59] We've got the most overmedicated,
[1:06:02] neurotic society we've ever had
[1:06:06] based on modern parenting methods. No,
[1:06:09] thank you. But it was so funny because
[1:06:12] this guy came right back and he said,
[1:06:14] "Jonathan, you think everything is black
[1:06:16] and white and it's not."
[1:06:19] And I saw it and then he deleted it.
[1:06:23] It was hilarious.
[1:06:25] He realized he'd gone too far. He's a
[1:06:27] very logical man. But here's the thing
[1:06:31] now. It's it's not true that I think
[1:06:33] everything is black and white, but I
[1:06:35] believe there are principles that are
[1:06:37] black and white. And there are
[1:06:39] absolutely things in the scripture that
[1:06:40] are black and white. It it's clear.
[1:06:42] There is no wiggle room.
[1:06:45] But the thing is, the principle that I
[1:06:47] was making is we make decisions for our
[1:06:49] children until they've learned to make a
[1:06:50] good one themselves.
[1:06:53] And his declaration was, "Your way isn't
[1:06:55] right just because it gets results."
[1:06:57] That's what he's saying. That's what
[1:06:59] he's saying. Your way isn't right just
[1:07:01] because it gets results. Well, he's
[1:07:02] going for he's batting 500. He's got
[1:07:04] 50/50 chance of a good kid versus a bad
[1:07:06] kid just by letting them do their own
[1:07:08] thing.
[1:07:11] But he doesn't want to say, "You're
[1:07:14] right. I should be parenting different."
[1:07:17] So, what he wants me to tell him is,
[1:07:19] "You're still a good parent." which I
[1:07:21] won't do.
[1:07:24] I'm not going to tell you you're getting
[1:07:25] if you're a good parent, you should get
[1:07:27] good results.
[1:07:30] And he's not getting them.
[1:07:35] He's wanting me to affirm him,
[1:07:38] not help him.
[1:07:40] The thing is, he's way older than me,
[1:07:42] should be more experienced,
[1:07:45] but he's failing and he doesn't know
[1:07:46] what to do about it. It's only a little
[1:07:48] area. It's only a little area. But the
[1:07:50] thing is that can control that girl's
[1:07:52] life for the rest of her life if they're
[1:07:54] not careful.
[1:07:56] See, what he wants is better results
[1:07:58] without having to say, "My way doesn't
[1:08:00] work."
[1:08:02] He doesn't want to change. He just wants
[1:08:04] the results to change. Church, that's
[1:08:06] never going to happen. It's never going
[1:08:08] to happen. There has to be a change at
[1:08:10] the base level. So, what is it that I'm
[1:08:13] saying? I said, "I don't always talk
[1:08:14] about the Bible. I don't always talk
[1:08:15] about Jesus. I don't always talk about
[1:08:17] church." What am I doing, church? These
[1:08:19] people are people that are concerned
[1:08:20] about young people. They're concerned
[1:08:22] about their children. And so what do I
[1:08:24] do? I tell them what I'm doing to
[1:08:26] produce good children. I'm giving them
[1:08:29] something that they're hungering for.
[1:08:32] They want their kids to be well spoken.
[1:08:34] They want them to be respectful. They
[1:08:35] want them to be hard workers. They want
[1:08:37] them to be gameful citizens. They want
[1:08:39] them to be these good things. And all
[1:08:41] I'm doing is I'm talking about how I get
[1:08:42] it by God's grace.
[1:08:46] And then when you have a a closer
[1:08:48] relationship with them, now you can sit
[1:08:50] down one-on-one and say, "I do it
[1:08:51] because this is what the Bible teaches
[1:08:53] us to do. It teaches us to set rules. It
[1:08:56] teaches us to discipline. It teaches us
[1:08:58] to set examples. Teaches us to do all of
[1:09:01] these different things." Amen. And
[1:09:02] that's when you get the opportunity to
[1:09:04] really present them with the truth. But
[1:09:06] upfront, I'm preaching to them and they
[1:09:08] don't know it. Why? I'm just sharing my
[1:09:11] life. I'm just sharing what God's done.
[1:09:14] Amen. I'm preaching a lifestyle with the
[1:09:16] results that they're looking for in
[1:09:18] hopes that they'll ask me, "How did you
[1:09:20] get those results?" That's all I'm
[1:09:22] doing. Amen. Then I can say, "I live by
[1:09:24] the Bible. I raise my kids by the
[1:09:26] principles that are in there." And it
[1:09:28] opens the door for us to talk about
[1:09:30] something they want to hear rather than
[1:09:32] me coming through and kicking open the
[1:09:34] door and say, "Hey, do you know Jesus?"
[1:09:37] There's a time to say that. There's a
[1:09:39] time to say that. When people are
[1:09:41] broken, that's a time to say, "Do you
[1:09:43] know Jesus?" But people today, they're
[1:09:46] so intellectual. They're so set in their
[1:09:48] ways. If they'll open the door, you're
[1:09:49] you're so much better off. You're so
[1:09:51] much better off. Amen.
[1:09:54] Then I can say, "Hey, I've got something
[1:09:55] to share with you." And then it's up to
[1:09:58] them to take it or leave it. But they
[1:10:00] see the results. Church, remember, we're
[1:10:03] here to live Christ, not just talk about
[1:10:05] Christ. They've got to see the results.
[1:10:07] We're speaking on the mind of Christ. I
[1:10:09] want you to see what that looks like in
[1:10:10] practice. I'm showing you you don't have
[1:10:12] to perform signs and wonders or be a
[1:10:14] preacher or deacon. I'm saying that
[1:10:16] you've got something to offer hungry
[1:10:18] people. And that something is Christ.
[1:10:21] It's a living Christ. It's not religion.
[1:10:23] It's not going to church. It's the
[1:10:25] reality of Christ. You know, we look at
[1:10:28] Peter on the day of Pentecost when he's
[1:10:30] filled with the spirit and he came down
[1:10:31] those steps. The Holy Spirit had him
[1:10:33] stand up and start preaching a sermon.
[1:10:36] But can you imagine today if Peter was a
[1:10:38] member of a modern church?
[1:10:42] Can you imagine the board meeting before
[1:10:44] they went down? Can you imagine as they
[1:10:46] gather the other 119 people there and
[1:10:48] said, "Okay, look at what we've got.
[1:10:51] We've got one shot. One shot to get this
[1:10:54] right now. Peter, you've got the keys to
[1:10:58] the kingdom. So you are the man that's
[1:10:59] going to preach this service. Now Peter,
[1:11:02] we're here to preach mercy and grace.
[1:11:06] Peter, we're here to get them into the
[1:11:08] second church service or to get them
[1:11:11] through the church doors when we finally
[1:11:12] buy one. Peter, we do not want to offend
[1:11:16] anybody.
[1:11:17] We don't want any drama. We just want a
[1:11:20] second crack at them. Pete, just take it
[1:11:24] easy. Okay? That's what the modern
[1:11:26] church would say. You say, "How do you
[1:11:28] know that?" Because that's what they're
[1:11:29] preaching today.
[1:11:31] That's what they're preaching today. But
[1:11:33] remember, church, the spirit of God is
[1:11:35] seeking people that hunger and thirst.
[1:11:39] It's not seeking those that are just
[1:11:41] happy where they're at. If you're happy
[1:11:43] where you're at, you don't want what
[1:11:44] we've got. But it's seeking those that
[1:11:46] are hungering and thirsting for
[1:11:48] righteousness to fulfill the word of
[1:11:50] God. Listen, there are people that are
[1:11:51] sitting in church that don't have the
[1:11:53] reality of Jesus Christ in their life,
[1:11:56] and they're hungering and thirsting. And
[1:11:58] then there's people out there that don't
[1:12:00] know anything about Christ and they've
[1:12:02] got an empty hole in their life that
[1:12:04] they can't fill no matter what. And they
[1:12:06] don't even realize it. But they're
[1:12:07] hungering and thirsting for
[1:12:08] righteousness. They've got no
[1:12:10] contentment.
[1:12:12] They've got no assurance. Doesn't matter
[1:12:14] what they get. Doesn't matter what they
[1:12:16] do. Doesn't matter who they're with.
[1:12:17] Doesn't matter how much money they get.
[1:12:19] Doesn't matter how great their vacation
[1:12:20] is. Doesn't matter how much alcohol they
[1:12:22] drink, how many drugs they take, how
[1:12:23] many cigarettes they smoke. They're not
[1:12:25] satisfied. There's something in them
[1:12:27] that's hungering and thirsting. That's
[1:12:28] who we're after. They don't even know
[1:12:30] what they're hungering and thirsting
[1:12:32] for. All they know is they're not
[1:12:33] satisfied. Church, that's who I'm
[1:12:35] preaching for is the ones that don't
[1:12:38] have what they need. They say, "I'm
[1:12:40] missing something and I don't know what
[1:12:42] it is and I've tried everything." Like
[1:12:44] the woman at the well, she tried
[1:12:45] everything and everyone. Finally, she
[1:12:47] met the man that would satisfy her. Look
[1:12:51] at Peter now when he comes down.
[1:12:54] Remember, everyone came down speaking
[1:12:56] new languages. Everyone understood what
[1:12:58] they were saying in their own language.
[1:12:59] And it caused a big stir in the crowd,
[1:13:01] and they're trying to figure out what's
[1:13:02] wrong. And it says, "And they were all
[1:13:03] amazed and were in doubt, saying one to
[1:13:05] another, what meanth this?" Others were
[1:13:08] mocking, saying, These men are full of
[1:13:09] new wine. But Peter standing up with the
[1:13:11] 11, lifted up his voice, and said unto
[1:13:13] them, "Ye men of Judea, and all ye that
[1:13:15] dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto
[1:13:18] you, and hearken to my words, for these
[1:13:20] are not drunken as you suppose, seeing
[1:13:22] it is but the third hour of the day, but
[1:13:25] this is that which is spoken by the
[1:13:28] prophet Joel." He says, "And it shall
[1:13:30] come to pass in the last days, sayaith
[1:13:32] God, I'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:13:35] flesh, and your sons and daughters shall
[1:13:37] prophesy. Your young men shall see
[1:13:38] visions. Your old men shall dream
[1:13:40] dreams. And on my servants and on my
[1:13:43] handmaidadens I will pour out in those
[1:13:46] days of my spirit. And they shall
[1:13:49] prophesy. Now I'm not going to read all
[1:13:50] of Acts two for the sake of time, but
[1:13:52] notice what Peter's doing. They come
[1:13:54] down and it's an experience nobody's
[1:13:56] ever had in their church before.
[1:13:59] Completely different from anything
[1:14:00] they've ever heard preached by their
[1:14:02] priests.
[1:14:04] And Peter comes down. They say, "What is
[1:14:06] this?" Now, some are they're they're
[1:14:08] just they're not sure. But others are
[1:14:10] they're skeptical. They're critical. Oh,
[1:14:12] they're just drunk. He says, "No,
[1:14:15] they're not drunk." He says, "It's only
[1:14:16] the third hour of the day. Nobody's
[1:14:19] drinking this early." He says, "But what
[1:14:22] this is, this is the word being
[1:14:24] fulfilled." And what he's doing is he's
[1:14:27] taking them to the season of life that
[1:14:29] they're in according to the word. And he
[1:14:32] says, "You're in the middle of
[1:14:33] prophecy." We've heard about this for
[1:14:36] hundreds and hundreds of years that
[1:14:37] God's going to do it. Guess what? He's
[1:14:39] just done it. He's taking them to the
[1:14:42] word of their day. Amen. He's giving
[1:14:45] showing them this experience you're
[1:14:47] having was prophesied all this time. He
[1:14:50] says, "And it shall come to pass that
[1:14:51] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:14:54] the Lord shall be saved." Now, at this
[1:14:56] point, if it was a nominal church,
[1:14:57] they'd say, "Hey, man. Pete's doing a
[1:14:59] good job today. Look at him. He's
[1:15:01] preaching the word. He's showing us
[1:15:02] where we are in prophecy. He's showing
[1:15:04] the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He's
[1:15:06] showing them the good things God's done.
[1:15:08] He's showing them that God is present
[1:15:10] with us. Preach it, Peter. Keep going,
[1:15:13] brother.
[1:15:15] That's what we'd be saying if we were a
[1:15:16] nominal church.
[1:15:18] But remember, Peter's preaching what
[1:15:20] he's led to preach, not what he wants to
[1:15:23] preach. He's being led by the spirit of
[1:15:26] God. He's got the mind of Christ. Now,
[1:15:28] maybe this isn't the direction Peter
[1:15:30] would have chosen. Who knows? But all we
[1:15:31] know is that he's yielded to the spirit
[1:15:34] and watch how he's being led. So we say,
[1:15:37] "Okay, Pete, you're doing great."
[1:15:40] Then Pete says, "Ye men of Israel, hear
[1:15:43] these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man
[1:15:46] approved of God among you by miracles
[1:15:48] and wonders and signs which God did by
[1:15:50] him in the midst of you, as ye
[1:15:51] yourselves also know. him being
[1:15:53] delivered by the determined counsel and
[1:15:55] fornowledge of God. You have taken and
[1:15:58] by wicked hands have crucified and
[1:16:01] slain.
[1:16:02] You could just see the church members
[1:16:04] stiffen.
[1:16:06] What's Peter doing? We told him no
[1:16:08] drama, no offending, no rebuking. We got
[1:16:12] to get him back for a second service. We
[1:16:14] got to reel him in slowly. And now he's
[1:16:18] telling them they killed their Messiah.
[1:16:22] Way to kill the atmosphere, Pete.
[1:16:26] Right.
[1:16:29] Is he nuts preaching on this in the
[1:16:32] first service? They'll never come back.
[1:16:39] Church, that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:16:40] looks like.
[1:16:42] It's not here to scratch the itching
[1:16:45] ears of the congregation.
[1:16:48] Amen.
[1:16:51] putting Jesus blood
[1:16:53] on their hands. He says, "You did it.
[1:16:57] You did it. You did it. All of you did
[1:17:01] it. You killed your Lord and Savior."
[1:17:07] He says, "You know what's the matter?
[1:17:09] It's because that people will come to
[1:17:11] church. The people today want
[1:17:12] entertainment. The American people are
[1:17:15] so entertained." He says that that's
[1:17:17] what they have to have. that feeds the
[1:17:19] spirit that's in them. It's an
[1:17:20] entertaining spirit. You have to
[1:17:22] entertain them. He says God doesn't
[1:17:23] entertain people. He rebukes people. He
[1:17:26] says judgment begins at the house of
[1:17:29] God. That's that's harsh. That'll kill
[1:17:32] the buzz in a service, won't it, church?
[1:17:34] We've got to be led by the spirit. And
[1:17:37] we've got to be able to recognize the
[1:17:38] leadership of the spirit is not always
[1:17:40] comfortable.
[1:17:42] Not always comfortable by any means. I
[1:17:44] admire Peter because remember Peter used
[1:17:46] to be a bit of a coward. And now he's
[1:17:48] preaching to thousands of people.
[1:17:52] You killed your Messiah. His blood is on
[1:17:55] your hands. You did it again. You
[1:17:57] haven't just killed the prophets in the
[1:17:59] past. Now you killed the prophet. The
[1:18:01] greatest one that you've been looking
[1:18:03] for all this time. You killed him. You
[1:18:06] did the unthinkable.
[1:18:09] Can you imagine?
[1:18:11] Can you imagine the response there? But
[1:18:14] church, I want you to catch something.
[1:18:16] There's always grace beyond the
[1:18:19] judgment,
[1:18:21] beyond the conviction, beyond the hard
[1:18:24] words. There's always grace if it's the
[1:18:26] spirit speaking. Amen. That's a hard
[1:18:28] thing to do is keep listening when the
[1:18:30] word is hard. Because remember, the Holy
[1:18:33] Spirit is not a condemning spirit. It's
[1:18:35] a convicting spirit. It always gives you
[1:18:38] a way back home. It always takes you
[1:18:42] back to God. Amen. I preached some hard
[1:18:45] things in the last few sermons. I want
[1:18:47] to say God bless you to those that came
[1:18:48] up and said, "Brother John, keep doing
[1:18:50] it. We need it." God bless you for that
[1:18:52] because that's what we're looking for.
[1:18:54] That's what we're looking for. Amen. Can
[1:18:56] you imagine, church? What would have
[1:18:58] happened if Peter backed off? If Peter
[1:19:00] just said, "You know what? We're just
[1:19:02] going to preach the Holy Ghost."
[1:19:05] What would have happened?
[1:19:07] What would have happened? You'd end up
[1:19:09] with religion without repentance.
[1:19:13] religion without repentance.
[1:19:16] And it would just take them right back.
[1:19:17] They'd have a new doctrine and the same
[1:19:19] old heart and the same old spirit and it
[1:19:22] keep sending them on the way to hell.
[1:19:24] You'd have affirmative religion. Isn't
[1:19:27] that what we have today? Affirmative
[1:19:28] religion rather than transformational
[1:19:31] power.
[1:19:32] Because remember, Peter's preaching a
[1:19:34] power. He's not preaching a doctrine.
[1:19:36] He's preaching power. He's preaching a
[1:19:39] lifechanging experience. And so Peter
[1:19:41] had to stay with the leading of the
[1:19:43] spirit. Remember what Paul would say
[1:19:44] later. He says, "I have not shunned to
[1:19:46] declare you the full counsel of God."
[1:19:50] Paul preached some hard services too.
[1:19:53] Those Corinthians, boy, you talked about
[1:19:54] skinned
[1:19:56] hard preaching. But you know what? They
[1:19:59] kept coming back and they listened to
[1:20:01] what he said. And Paul would say,
[1:20:02] "Listen, I told you to do this and I
[1:20:04] wrote it with a heavy heart because I
[1:20:06] knew what I was saying was hard to do."
[1:20:07] He says, "But then you came back and you
[1:20:09] did it exactly like I said." He said,
[1:20:11] "God, you know, God bless you. Thank you
[1:20:13] for doing that. Now go and restore the
[1:20:14] person that we had you deal with.
[1:20:17] If you stay with it, there's always a
[1:20:19] way to come back. God always brings us
[1:20:22] back." Amen. But it's not always a
[1:20:24] comforting word or an encouraging or
[1:20:26] faithb buildinging word. There's
[1:20:27] correction and rebuke as well. There has
[1:20:29] to be in the word. Otherwise, it's me
[1:20:31] controlling the gospel.
[1:20:33] I'd love to preach wonderful services
[1:20:34] wherever he walks out and just says,
[1:20:35] "Oh, I feel so loved and encouraged and
[1:20:37] faith built." See, we need to be
[1:20:39] stripped down as much as we need to be
[1:20:40] built up because we're being shaped into
[1:20:42] his image. Amen. That's what's supposed
[1:20:45] to be happening. If I take those things
[1:20:47] into my own hands, church, look out.
[1:20:49] Look out. What a mess I would make of
[1:20:52] the church if I only preached what I
[1:20:53] thought you wanted to hear. He says,
[1:20:55] "Every time we take the matter in our
[1:20:57] hands, we're going to fail."
[1:20:59] He says, "You just go as the Lord leads
[1:21:01] and what the Lord says, do then you do
[1:21:04] that and you'll never fail." He says,
[1:21:06] "You can't fail because you're following
[1:21:08] the leading of the Lord." How do you
[1:21:11] know it's the Lord? It matches with his
[1:21:13] word from Genesis to Revelation. That's
[1:21:15] how you know.
[1:21:18] And we've got to come to a place,
[1:21:19] church, where that matters more than
[1:21:21] anything.
[1:21:23] That matters more than anything.
[1:21:25] Remember what Jesus said? He says, "My
[1:21:26] meat, what sustains me, what fills me,"
[1:21:30] he said, "is to do the will of my
[1:21:32] father." His thirst, his hunger, his
[1:21:34] satisfying portion was to do what God
[1:21:37] had showed him to do. And when it was
[1:21:40] done, he was so satisfied. So satisfied
[1:21:43] he could skip a meal and be satisfied.
[1:21:47] Church, what are we willing to skip to
[1:21:49] be satisfied with what God's asking us
[1:21:51] to do?
[1:21:52] Let me tell you, you do it once and
[1:21:54] you'll want to keep doing it because
[1:21:56] there's a satisfaction. There's a depth
[1:21:58] to that that can come with new stuff,
[1:22:00] with great jobs, with money, with
[1:22:02] houses, with cars, with recognition,
[1:22:04] promotions, with those things. You step
[1:22:05] into the will of God and see him do what
[1:22:07] he told you he was going to do. You'll
[1:22:09] never be the same again.
[1:22:11] You'll never be the same again.
[1:22:15] But watch what Peter says now. He's
[1:22:17] given judgment. He's rebuked. He says,
[1:22:20] "Whom God hath raised up, having loosed
[1:22:23] the pains of death, because it was not
[1:22:27] possible that he that Christ should
[1:22:29] behold of it." Church, what a thrilling
[1:22:31] thing to have him hear him say. He comes
[1:22:33] and says, "Listen, you killed the
[1:22:35] Messiah. You killed Christ. You killed
[1:22:37] the one you've been longing for all this
[1:22:39] life." And then he says, "And it didn't
[1:22:40] stop God." Hallelujah. It didn't stop
[1:22:43] God. your actions, your lack of actions,
[1:22:46] your disbelief, your lack of faith,
[1:22:49] you're stepping out on your own. It
[1:22:50] didn't stop him because his word already
[1:22:53] knew what was coming and it made a way
[1:22:55] through and you couldn't hold him back.
[1:22:57] He says death couldn't hold him. You had
[1:22:59] to kill him, but it couldn't hold him
[1:23:01] because the word said he had to rise up
[1:23:03] again.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Church, that's the rest I have this
[1:23:06] morning is it's not whether I do it,
[1:23:08] it's whether he's already done it by his
[1:23:10] word. Remember we said last verse we
[1:23:12] read that quote that says when he speaks
[1:23:14] his word it's already done. Sometimes
[1:23:18] we're so stuck on what we're doing we
[1:23:20] forget that it's already done according
[1:23:22] to his word. He'll make a way through.
[1:23:25] We can't mess it up.
[1:23:27] We can't mess it up. Amen. God will make
[1:23:30] a way through. How? By the word that
[1:23:32] he's already declared. And watch how
[1:23:34] Peter now he takes him down this
[1:23:36] beautiful path of grace. He said, 'For
[1:23:39] David speaketh concerning him. I foresaw
[1:23:41] the Lord always before my face, for he
[1:23:44] is on my right hand that I should not be
[1:23:46] moved. Therefore did my heart rejoice
[1:23:48] and my tongue was glad. Moreover also my
[1:23:51] flesh shall rest in hope because thou
[1:23:54] shalt not leave my soul in hell. Neither
[1:23:57] wil thou suffer thine holy one to see
[1:23:59] corruption. What the grave couldn't hold
[1:24:02] Christ because the word through David
[1:24:04] had said it will not corrupt.
[1:24:07] Christ laid down his life. He put his
[1:24:09] own body in the grave on the basis of
[1:24:11] the word.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; That's it. And that's what he's doing
[1:24:15] through you and I. We lay ourselves down
[1:24:17] because the word tells us he'll pick it
[1:24:19] up again.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; If the same spirit that raised Christ
[1:24:22] from the dead dwells in you, it shall it
[1:24:27] shall quicken your mortal body. It'll
[1:24:29] make you live and it'll change you.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; And at the end, it'll give you a new
[1:24:33] body like under his glorious body.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what a wonderful place to be.
[1:24:37] He says, "Thou hast made me known, thou
[1:24:40] has made known to me the ways of life,
[1:24:42] and thou shalt make me full of joy with
[1:24:45] thy countenance." He says, "This Jesus
[1:24:47] hath God raised up whereof we are all
[1:24:50] witnesses." He says, "Therefore, being
[1:24:52] by the right hand of God, exalted, and
[1:24:55] having received of the Father the
[1:24:57] promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed
[1:24:59] forth this which ye now see and hear."
[1:25:02] In other words, he's saying, "Listen, he
[1:25:04] doesn't hold it against you. You killed
[1:25:07] him.
[1:25:09] It was unrighteous. It was wrong. It
[1:25:11] wasn't fair. It wasn't good. It wasn't
[1:25:13] of God. You did it thinking you were
[1:25:16] doing God a service." He says, "But it
[1:25:18] wasn't. But yet, God doesn't hold it
[1:25:20] against you." To the contrary, he has
[1:25:23] sent down his own spirit once again in
[1:25:26] front of you to give you a chance to
[1:25:28] make it right. What a glorious thing. to
[1:25:32] say he hasn't held it against me, but
[1:25:35] he's offering grace this morning. He's
[1:25:38] offering grace. Amen. What's he doing?
[1:25:40] He said he's bringing his word to pass
[1:25:42] for your sake. Cuz clearly you need a
[1:25:46] change. Clearly, you've gone in a wrong
[1:25:48] direction, but he's standing here not
[1:25:50] holding your sins against you, but to
[1:25:52] the contrary, saying, "Let me blot them
[1:25:54] out for you, and let me make you live
[1:25:56] the way you always thought you were
[1:25:57] living in the first place."
[1:26:00] Wow.
[1:26:03] murderers of Christ. And then Christ
[1:26:05] says, "I'll give you my spirit."
[1:26:08] That's forgiveness. That's mercy. That's
[1:26:10] grace this morning. He says, "Therefore,
[1:26:13] let all the house of Israel know
[1:26:15] assuredly that God hath made that same
[1:26:17] Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord
[1:26:20] and Christ." Church, I don't know about
[1:26:22] you, but if I was sitting there and
[1:26:24] somebody had said that to me, I think my
[1:26:26] stomach would drop. You talk about a pit
[1:26:28] in your stomach.
[1:26:32] I killed the one I've been waiting for.
[1:26:36] I was in the day of promise and I killed
[1:26:38] the promise.
[1:26:41] What a horrible thing to realize.
[1:26:44] If you believe Peter, that had to be one
[1:26:47] of the worst moments of your life, if
[1:26:48] not the worst, because everything was
[1:26:51] pointing to the Messiah, and now the
[1:26:53] Messiah is behind you, and not only have
[1:26:56] you missed him, you killed him. What a
[1:26:58] horrible place to be. But remember, the
[1:27:01] Holy Spirit is a convicting spirit, not
[1:27:04] a condemning spirit.
[1:27:07] If we walk out under condemnation, we've
[1:27:09] missed the message.
[1:27:11] And Satan will try and get you on the
[1:27:13] judgment part without letting you hear
[1:27:14] the grace part that follows every single
[1:27:17] time. It always shows us how to make
[1:27:19] things right. And listen to what Peter
[1:27:21] they said. Now when they heard this,
[1:27:24] they were pricricked in their heart and
[1:27:26] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:27:27] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[1:27:29] we do? What does that word pricricked
[1:27:31] mean? Now a lot of people will say
[1:27:34] convicted, and that's that's true in
[1:27:36] general, I guess. But the real meaning
[1:27:37] is that it says they were stung to the
[1:27:40] quick.
[1:27:44] In other words, this sermon emotionally
[1:27:47] and physically pierced them. It agitated
[1:27:51] them. It stirred them up. It got them
[1:27:55] not just uncomfortable, painfully
[1:27:58] uncomfortable.
[1:28:00] Amen.
[1:28:03] The raw truth stings.
[1:28:05] And what they got here was the raw
[1:28:07] truth. You did it.
[1:28:10] Thou art the man.
[1:28:12] That's what they heard.
[1:28:15] Now remember, church, these were sincere
[1:28:18] believers.
[1:28:20] You look at the book of Acts in chapter
[1:28:21] 2, it says they were devout.
[1:28:24] In other words, they were living their
[1:28:26] life to the best that they knew how
[1:28:28] according to the laws of God and they
[1:28:31] still killed their Messiah.
[1:28:34] Now, Peter comes and he completely
[1:28:36] wrecks their self assessment of who they
[1:28:39] are as believers, professing believers.
[1:28:43] But notice their response. Did they
[1:28:45] leave the church? Did they leave the
[1:28:47] crowd? Did they slink backwards hoping
[1:28:49] that Peter would not make eye contact
[1:28:51] with them? Were they offended? Did they
[1:28:54] hoot and holler and try and shout Peter
[1:28:56] down?
[1:28:58] No. Because remember, they're sincere.
[1:29:02] They're really sincere. And so what do
[1:29:04] they do? There's something that happens
[1:29:06] in the soul realm and they say, "You're
[1:29:09] right.
[1:29:10] We did do this."
[1:29:13] Church confession is the first thing we
[1:29:15] got to do. I am the man.
[1:29:19] I did it.
[1:29:21] But what do they say? They say, "How do
[1:29:23] we fix this?" That's what I love. They
[1:29:27] don't run out the church doors. Oh, the
[1:29:29] pastor pinned me to the pew today. I'm
[1:29:31] never going back. No, they said, "How do
[1:29:33] we fix it? How do we fix it?"
[1:29:38] Why? Because there was a hunger and a
[1:29:40] thirst for righteousness.
[1:29:43] Not self-righteousness.
[1:29:45] righteousness to be in right standing
[1:29:48] with God. Amen. That's what they were
[1:29:51] looking for. Remember our opening
[1:29:52] scripture.
[1:29:54] Blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:29:56] thirst after righteousness.
[1:29:59] What's the promise, church? You notice
[1:30:02] here it puts the colon there.
[1:30:06] That shows there's often a period of
[1:30:08] time between the hungering and thirsting
[1:30:10] and the next part. It's there to show a
[1:30:12] period of time, but it says they shall
[1:30:15] be filled.
[1:30:17] That's the trial of your faith is that
[1:30:19] that colon right there between the
[1:30:20] hungering and the thirsting and the
[1:30:22] filling. That's the trial of your faith.
[1:30:24] Will you stick with it? Will you hold
[1:30:26] with it? But he says, listen, if you
[1:30:28] hunger and thirst, you're going to be
[1:30:30] filled. There was a hunger and a thirst
[1:30:33] in those people's lives. Remember, they
[1:30:35] had to kill Christ because the word said
[1:30:37] they did.
[1:30:39] But it also meant there was a people
[1:30:41] there that will come back to him when
[1:30:43] they were preached the truth.
[1:30:45] When the next portion of the word came
[1:30:48] that there had to be a pouring out of
[1:30:50] the spirit, they could be recipients of
[1:30:52] that as well. Amen. And these were a
[1:30:54] people that could say, "He's right. We
[1:30:56] did do it.
[1:30:58] How do we make it right? How do we get
[1:31:01] back into the good graces of God? How do
[1:31:03] we become acceptable for God?" Because
[1:31:05] there was a hunger and a thirst inside
[1:31:06] of them to be right with God above all
[1:31:08] else. above all else. Church, what am I
[1:31:11] telling you this for this morning?
[1:31:13] Because if there's a hunger for more of
[1:31:15] God, there's more of God to be had.
[1:31:18] It's that simple. If you've got a
[1:31:20] hunger, that means there's something to
[1:31:22] satisfy it. You got a thirst this
[1:31:24] morning, church, there's something
[1:31:26] that'll satisfy that thirst.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; 100% there is. Amen. But you've got to
[1:31:31] leave everything else behind.
[1:31:35] You got to lay everything else down. He
[1:31:38] said, "If you're hungering and thirsting
[1:31:39] for righteousness, you'll be filled.
[1:31:41] You'll get what you're desiring." But
[1:31:43] notice what they got filled with was not
[1:31:45] what they expected. We can't tell God
[1:31:48] how to fill us. We just have to say, "I
[1:31:50] want to be filled." It's up to him to
[1:31:53] determine how it comes, when it comes,
[1:31:55] how it feels, what it looks like. It'll
[1:31:57] be by the word. But too often we set
[1:31:59] expectations for what God has to do. And
[1:32:02] we miss what he's trying to do. The
[1:32:04] simplicity of the word becoming flesh in
[1:32:06] you.
[1:32:08] It may not be all shouting and dancing.
[1:32:10] I'll tell you this, with repentance
[1:32:11] comes tears, comes a soberness,
[1:32:16] comes an inward checking,
[1:32:19] and after that comes joy in the morning.
[1:32:23] Amen. How can you be filled if you're
[1:32:26] not empty?
[1:32:30] If we're so full, what room is there for
[1:32:33] God?
[1:32:34] How can we be thirsty if we've been
[1:32:36] drinking so many other things all day?
[1:32:39] I woke up this morning and I was
[1:32:40] completely dehydrated. And so I was just
[1:32:43] drinking water after water after water.
[1:32:44] I I don't know how I made it to the
[1:32:46] pulpit
[1:32:48] because after a while, what goes in has
[1:32:49] to come out. But the thing is, we often
[1:32:52] too often what we're doing is we're
[1:32:54] keeping ourselves topped up with
[1:32:55] everything but God.
[1:32:58] And so we come and we're not thirsty.
[1:33:02] We're satisfied already.
[1:33:04] You got to be hungry. You got to be
[1:33:06] thirsting. You come to church, satisfied
[1:33:08] church, what are you going to get?
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Nothing. That's right. Thank you,
[1:33:14] brother Grant. You'll get nothing if
[1:33:16] you're already full. And I'll tell you
[1:33:18] this, chances are if you're full, you
[1:33:20] didn't come full of God. You came full
[1:33:22] of the cares of this world, of all the
[1:33:24] things we're trying to do. And what does
[1:33:26] it do? It chokes out that hunger and it
[1:33:27] chokes out that thirst.
[1:33:29] Amen.
[1:33:32] What does it look like? This hungering
[1:33:34] and thirsting.
[1:33:37] Let me tell you, where you are will tell
[1:33:39] you what you're hungrying and thirsting
[1:33:40] for. Your speech will betray your
[1:33:43] hunger.
[1:33:45] Your attitude will betray your hunger.
[1:33:47] Your confession will betray your hunger.
[1:33:49] Amen. Your priorities will show what
[1:33:52] you're seeking to fulfill.
[1:33:57] Listen to this. He says, "I think we
[1:33:59] need the Christ."
[1:34:01] Yes, sir. Only way we see Christ is when
[1:34:03] he reflects in each other. I see Christ
[1:34:05] in you. You see him in me. That's how we
[1:34:07] watch Christ. He says, "I come to the
[1:34:09] meeting. I start preaching. I watch the
[1:34:11] people. You can see whether they're
[1:34:13] interested or not. Just a few minutes.
[1:34:15] You can look over your audience." She
[1:34:17] says, "You can tell whether you're
[1:34:18] boring them or whether you're not." And
[1:34:21] everyone suddenly looked very interested
[1:34:22] in church.
[1:34:27] church. If you're asleep, I'm pretty
[1:34:30] sure you're not hungry and thirsting.
[1:34:33] If you're not here, I'm pretty sure
[1:34:35] you're not hungry and thirsty.
[1:34:38] If you're not entering into worship, I'm
[1:34:40] pretty sure you're not hungry and
[1:34:41] thirsty.
[1:34:44] He says, you can tell whether you're
[1:34:46] boring them or whether you're not. And
[1:34:48] the first thing you know, you see them
[1:34:49] sitting there hanging on to every word
[1:34:53] under expectation. He says, "See, I'm
[1:34:55] seeing Christ reflected in that person
[1:34:58] because he's hungering and thirsting for
[1:35:01] God." Amen.
[1:35:04] Church is a participation sport.
[1:35:10] It's not an observation sport.
[1:35:14] It's not coming to church and watching
[1:35:17] and listening to Brother John. It's
[1:35:20] about coming into church and pulling
[1:35:22] what you have need of out of that
[1:35:24] minister whether he's got it in his
[1:35:25] notes or not.
[1:35:28] It's about setting an atmosphere so the
[1:35:31] Holy Spirit can work in hearts and
[1:35:32] lives. Amen.
[1:35:35] This is not the Jonathan Kurlet show.
[1:35:38] This is not the pastor show. It's not
[1:35:40] the ministry show. Amen. We're a body
[1:35:44] with one head under Christ. And it's the
[1:35:47] spirit of God moving in us that's going
[1:35:48] to take us where we need to go. Amen.
[1:35:52] You say, "I want more of God." How many
[1:35:54] want more of God this morning?
[1:35:57] Let your life show it. Not just your
[1:36:00] words. Not just your words. Amen. Let
[1:36:02] your attitude say it. Yes. Let your
[1:36:04] words say it. But if it's only words,
[1:36:06] it's not going to work. If it's only
[1:36:08] words, it's not going to work. Amen.
[1:36:10] Scripture says if you seek him with all
[1:36:11] your heart, all your soul, and all your
[1:36:14] mind. He said, "Knock and it'll be
[1:36:17] opened." Church, if you want to go
[1:36:19] through a door, you'll knock until that
[1:36:21] door is opened. Seek and you will find.
[1:36:24] Ask and it shall be given unto you.
[1:36:26] Amen. But a lukewarm attempt is no
[1:36:28] attempt at all. Well, I'll go to church
[1:36:31] and see what happens.
[1:36:33] Lukewarm.
[1:36:35] Knock
[1:36:38] until it opens. Remember
[1:36:41] the parable of the unjust judge?
[1:36:44] There was a woman that needed relief
[1:36:47] and she went to this judge and she
[1:36:48] pestered him and she pestered him and
[1:36:50] she pestered him and he said, "Even
[1:36:51] though neither God nor man can tell me
[1:36:54] what to do,
[1:36:56] I'm going to do what this woman wants
[1:36:58] just to get her out of my door."
[1:37:01] And he says, "If an unjust judge will do
[1:37:03] that, how much more your heavenly
[1:37:04] father?" But what happens? We come in
[1:37:07] one service
[1:37:10] Oh, he didn't answer. Oh, well, no, no,
[1:37:13] no. Keep knocking till he opens. Keep
[1:37:16] seeking till you find.
[1:37:19] Keep asking till he answers. Not till he
[1:37:21] gives, till he answers. Amen. The answer
[1:37:24] may be no, but let him give you an
[1:37:26] answer. Amen. It's got to be Christ or
[1:37:28] nothing. It's got to be the Holy Ghost
[1:37:30] or nothing. Church, there is no in
[1:37:33] between. Amen. Like Jacob, remember what
[1:37:35] he said? I will not let you go.
[1:37:39] until you bless me. Jacob's got a busted
[1:37:42] hip.
[1:37:44] Now, I haven't had a busted hip. It's
[1:37:47] hard enough to wrestle all night without
[1:37:48] a bad hip. Then God knocks your hip
[1:37:51] joint out of socket. Most of us would
[1:37:54] say, "That's enough. You want to go? You
[1:37:55] can go, Lord." Jacob said, "I'm not
[1:37:57] going to let you go until you give me
[1:37:59] what I came for." That's what we're
[1:38:01] looking for. That's a hungering and
[1:38:03] thirsting. That's a desperation.
[1:38:06] Amen. Otherwise, it's just lukewarm.
[1:38:09] Well, I asked and he didn't. I tried and
[1:38:12] it didn't. No, keep after it. Keep after
[1:38:16] it.
[1:38:18] What does this mind of Christ and Peter
[1:38:20] do for them?
[1:38:22] Takes them to the word for their day.
[1:38:24] It's what the spirit always does. It
[1:38:26] takes us to the word for their day. And
[1:38:28] only one person had it. Peter. Peter had
[1:38:31] the keys to the kingdom. Peter had the
[1:38:34] way to unlock that door. In Acts two, he
[1:38:36] would say this. He says, "Then Peter
[1:38:37] said unto them, they said, "How do we
[1:38:39] fix it? What shall we do?" He says,
[1:38:41] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[1:38:43] you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:38:46] remission of sins, and you shall receive
[1:38:48] the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[1:38:52] Not just repent.
[1:38:55] Many churches today, they're skipping
[1:38:56] the repentance altogether.
[1:38:59] You got to repent. You got to
[1:39:01] acknowledge, "I'm wrong.
[1:39:03] I'm not where I ought to be. I've
[1:39:06] failed. I've done my own thing, church.
[1:39:08] And that's not a repentance that just
[1:39:10] sits there. It's through our entire
[1:39:12] life. We ought to repent every night.
[1:39:15] When our day is over, we ought to repent
[1:39:18] every night. Absolutely. Be baptized.
[1:39:23] Well, I was baptized. How were you
[1:39:25] baptized?
[1:39:27] In the name of Father, Son, and Holy
[1:39:28] Ghost. Well, that's not what Peter said.
[1:39:29] He says, "What is the name of the
[1:39:30] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? It's Jesus
[1:39:31] Christ. Baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:39:34] Christ. And then am I saved? He says,
[1:39:36] "No, to fix this, you got to get the
[1:39:38] Holy Ghost."
[1:39:40] What? You got to have the promised word
[1:39:42] come into you.
[1:39:44] You got to have the reality of Christ in
[1:39:47] you. Amen. Jesus had prophesied this
[1:39:49] very thing couple years, one or two
[1:39:51] years earlier. We don't know exactly.
[1:39:53] And now it comes down to this day and
[1:39:54] time. And he says, "Listen, those that
[1:39:56] hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:39:59] shall be filled. them. What does he fill
[1:40:01] them with? A church, religion,
[1:40:05] community,
[1:40:07] lifestyle. No, with the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:12] The filling of your soul is what will
[1:40:14] satisfy that hunger. Not this flesh.
[1:40:17] This flesh is never satisfied. It is
[1:40:19] never satisfied. Much craves more. You
[1:40:22] can have all the money you ever thought
[1:40:23] you were going to need, and you'd still
[1:40:24] want more. You can have all the good
[1:40:26] food you ever thought you wanted, but
[1:40:27] guess what? You're going to wake up
[1:40:28] hungry again tomorrow.
[1:40:31] There's a, you know, they have these
[1:40:32] competitive eaters that that try and and
[1:40:35] eat a certain amount of food in a
[1:40:37] certain amount of time or hot dogs. You
[1:40:38] know, this guy Joey Chestnut is eating
[1:40:40] like 70 75 hot dogs in in uh I want to
[1:40:46] say 10 minutes or 15 minutes. I mean,
[1:40:47] it's it's basically just
[1:40:50] it's disgusting.
[1:40:52] But you know what they do? They make
[1:40:54] themselves hungry first.
[1:40:57] They practice by stretching out their
[1:40:59] stomach and then before they do a
[1:41:00] challenge, what do they do? They deprive
[1:41:02] themselves of food. So they've got all
[1:41:04] they got the most room in the tank that
[1:41:06] they can possibly do, right?
[1:41:10] How's he going to fill you, church? He's
[1:41:12] not going to fill you with everything
[1:41:13] you've been trying. That's for sure.
[1:41:15] Isn't that what the world is preaching?
[1:41:16] He'll give you more of what you got. No,
[1:41:18] no, no, no, no. He's got to give you
[1:41:20] what you don't have.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's going to
[1:41:22] satisfy you. It's the only thing that's
[1:41:24] going to satisfy you. It's the only
[1:41:26] thing that's going to work. Amen.
[1:41:27] Church, church, if we come here without
[1:41:30] the spirit of God, we're just living in
[1:41:32] front of a painted fire. A church
[1:41:34] without the Holy Ghost is an education,
[1:41:37] not an experience. It's dead religion.
[1:41:40] It's theology. It's doctrine. Hey, it
[1:41:42] makes us great citizens perhaps, but it
[1:41:45] doesn't make us sons and daughters of
[1:41:46] God. It takes the spirit of God in us.
[1:41:48] Amen. And I'll tell you this, your
[1:41:49] Christian education won't hold you in
[1:41:51] the day of trial. Remember scripture
[1:41:54] says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:41:56] flood, what raises up a standard?
[1:42:00] The spirit
[1:42:02] raises a standard. You can have all the
[1:42:04] word but no spirit. You're going to
[1:42:06] drop. You're going to fail. That's what
[1:42:08] they had. They had all the word and all
[1:42:10] it led them into was dead religion. It
[1:42:12] took the spirit to quicken them. Amen.
[1:42:15] We need a reality of God today more than
[1:42:17] ever. Catch this. you who have
[1:42:21] sacrificed that have crucified your
[1:42:23] Messiah. He says, "For the promise is
[1:42:25] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:42:28] that are a far off, even as many as the
[1:42:31] Lord our God shall call." And with many
[1:42:35] other words, this the other pressure of
[1:42:38] a preacher. In other words, this wasn't
[1:42:40] a short church service. Glory
[1:42:46] church. My intention is never to keep
[1:42:48] you long.
[1:42:50] But sometimes I do. And I trust it's the
[1:42:53] spirit that's keeping us, not brother
[1:42:55] John. Because the last thing we need is
[1:42:57] me up here pandering on and on and on
[1:42:58] and on and on. Amen. But listen,
[1:43:01] sometimes it goes long and sometimes it
[1:43:04] doesn't go long.
[1:43:06] 61 minutes, two pages to go. We're doing
[1:43:10] okay. But I want you to understand,
[1:43:12] sometimes the pressure is preacher, let
[1:43:14] the people out.
[1:43:17] These people stayed because they were
[1:43:19] hungry and thirsting. That's not a club
[1:43:21] for me to bludgeon the church with. See,
[1:43:22] if you're hungry and thirsting, you'd
[1:43:24] let me preach for two hours. By no
[1:43:25] means. But church, if it goes on, it
[1:43:27] goes on. And if it cuts short, it cuts
[1:43:29] short. We'll leave it up to the Lord.
[1:43:32] With many other words did he testify and
[1:43:34] exhort, saying, "Save yourselves from
[1:43:36] this unto generation." Then they that
[1:43:39] gladly
[1:43:40] gladly received his word were baptized,
[1:43:44] and the same day there were added unto
[1:43:46] them about 3,000 souls.
[1:43:51] See, the nominal church would have
[1:43:52] probably yanked Peter down before that.
[1:43:55] But what happens when the spirit finds a
[1:43:57] hungering and thirsting soul? It works.
[1:44:00] You just want to be a church member,
[1:44:02] it'll never work. But if you're
[1:44:03] hungering and thirsting for what God
[1:44:05] has, it'll work. and you'll be able to
[1:44:07] sit through it and you'll gladly receive
[1:44:09] what's coming from that man of God. Now,
[1:44:12] I want to bring it down to us today as
[1:44:13] we start to close because we're asking
[1:44:15] ourselves, do we have the mind of
[1:44:17] Christ?
[1:44:19] Brother David, do you have the mind of
[1:44:20] Christ today?
[1:44:22] He grinned, but he didn't nod. How do we
[1:44:25] know, Brother Grant? How do you know if
[1:44:27] you have the mind of Christ? I want to
[1:44:29] say I have it, but how do we know? What
[1:44:32] does it look like in our lives? Amen.
[1:44:35] We've got to look at what we're
[1:44:36] offering. We got to look at what we're
[1:44:38] living and see if it matches up with the
[1:44:40] same things that Christ offered and
[1:44:41] lived. And by that I mean our our lives,
[1:44:44] not our words. Words are cheap. I'm more
[1:44:47] interested in how you're living, not how
[1:44:48] you're talking.
[1:44:50] He says, "The thing that we want to do
[1:44:52] is preach a gospel that appeals to a
[1:44:55] hungry world. Not a gospel that appeases
[1:44:58] people. Not a gospel that keeps them
[1:45:00] satisfied where they are. Church, if
[1:45:02] they're full, they don't want the
[1:45:03] gospel. There's no room for it and all
[1:45:06] we're left then is entertainment.
[1:45:08] The church in Dallas recently put a
[1:45:10] roller coaster on the platform for their
[1:45:12] pastor to come in on.
[1:45:14] That's what it's come down to. Preaching
[1:45:17] movie series
[1:45:19] with gospel teachings.
[1:45:22] What is it? It's entertainment. It's not
[1:45:25] the gospel. It's entertainment. And when
[1:45:28] people aren't hungry, entertainment's
[1:45:30] the only thing that'll keep them in
[1:45:31] church.
[1:45:33] He says, "How now? How can you appeal to
[1:45:36] a hungry world that's wanting to see
[1:45:38] where they come from, who they are, and
[1:45:39] where they're going unless you preach a
[1:45:41] gospel that raises Christ up in a living
[1:45:44] atmosphere right here around us?" Now,
[1:45:46] he says, "We can't do it. There's no
[1:45:48] way. But we're to preach a gospel that's
[1:45:50] appealing to hungry people, that'll
[1:45:52] catch those who are hungering and
[1:45:54] thirsting for righteousness." He said,
[1:45:56] "Blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:45:58] thirst for righteousness, for they shall
[1:46:00] be filled." Now, he says, "How would
[1:46:01] they be? How would they be filled? He
[1:46:03] says, "Filled with what?" The Holy
[1:46:05] Spirit. The Bible says Steven was a man
[1:46:07] full. Full of what? He says, "Full of
[1:46:10] power, full of faith, full of love, full
[1:46:13] of the Holy Ghost." That's what made him
[1:46:16] what he was. Is because he was filled
[1:46:18] with the Holy Ghost. He says he was a
[1:46:20] real advertising board for Christ. See,
[1:46:23] church, we think it all has to be
[1:46:25] beautiful and eye-catching and snazzy
[1:46:27] and the latest this and the latest that.
[1:46:30] But church, we're not trying to make a
[1:46:31] blockbuster movie. We're trying to glow
[1:46:34] with the gospel.
[1:46:38] And those that want light will be drawn
[1:46:40] to light.
[1:46:42] It's not about a you know, they've got
[1:46:44] these um what do they call those those
[1:46:47] those lights that shift all the time?
[1:46:50] Oh, I don't know. Strobe lights. Yes.
[1:46:53] And they have it all. My daughter's
[1:46:55] apparently been in a club at some point.
[1:46:58] No, but you're right. those those strobe
[1:47:00] lights and they go out. They have those
[1:47:01] in churches plus fog machines now.
[1:47:03] They've had those for a while. You think
[1:47:05] about it. It's entertainment church. We
[1:47:06] are not here to entertain you. I
[1:47:08] appreciate the laughter. It lightens our
[1:47:11] hearts a bit. But I'm not here to
[1:47:12] entertain you. I'm not going to shout to
[1:47:15] entertain you. I'm not going to dance to
[1:47:17] entertain you.
[1:47:19] That's not going to work.
[1:47:22] because eventually you'll get sick and
[1:47:24] tired of what I'm offering and you'll
[1:47:26] move on to the next show, the next
[1:47:28] church, the next ministry.
[1:47:31] See, we think we've got to make it so
[1:47:33] appealing.
[1:47:37] He says Stephen was full of the Holy
[1:47:39] Ghost.
[1:47:41] Well, look at him as we start to close
[1:47:43] today. I want you to see something. What
[1:47:44] is it that offended them about Stephen?
[1:47:46] Church,
[1:47:48] Steven was the whole package. Stephen
[1:47:51] was what they were professing to be.
[1:47:55] Steven was full of the Holy Ghost. He
[1:47:57] did signs, wonders, and miracles. And he
[1:48:00] preached. Amen. Steven didn't have an
[1:48:04] affirming gospel. He had a challenging
[1:48:06] gospel. He had a come out of religion
[1:48:08] gospel. And he was speaking to things
[1:48:10] that they couldn't get past. Amen. They
[1:48:12] they they couldn't trip him up. They
[1:48:14] couldn't they couldn't get him into a
[1:48:16] trap. They couldn't knock him down. They
[1:48:17] couldn't take away his influence. In
[1:48:19] fact, the scripture says about this. It
[1:48:20] says, "And they were not able to resist
[1:48:22] the wisdom and the spirit by which he
[1:48:26] spoke." Remember, they had the exact
[1:48:28] same problem with Jesus. Jesus, they
[1:48:30] kept coming up. They kept testing him.
[1:48:32] They kept trying him. They kept trapping
[1:48:33] him. And what happened is he kept
[1:48:35] putting them into their own trap. He
[1:48:37] kept turning their own things against
[1:48:39] them. And eventually, they stopped
[1:48:41] asking him because he got sick and tired
[1:48:43] of being embarrassed. But now we come
[1:48:45] down to Steven. And Steven's under what?
[1:48:48] He's got a spirit of wisdom and a spirit
[1:48:50] of truth.
[1:48:52] He's got wisdom. What is it? That's
[1:48:53] truth. And he's got spirit. He's got the
[1:48:56] Holy Spirit. He's got the mind of Christ
[1:48:58] and the spirit of Christ. And therefore,
[1:49:00] church, he cannot be overcome.
[1:49:03] He's got the mind of Christ. The spirit
[1:49:04] of Christ. You put them together,
[1:49:06] church. That's God.
[1:49:09] That's God. The spirit of Christ with
[1:49:11] the mind of Christ. That's the That's
[1:49:13] the package of God there. It's only in
[1:49:15] portion in you and I. It's only an
[1:49:16] abortion in Steven. But yet, it cannot
[1:49:19] overcome him. They cannot overcome him.
[1:49:21] Why? Because he's united with his head.
[1:49:24] It's not him speaking. It's the mind of
[1:49:26] Christ. It's the spirit of Christ
[1:49:27] speaking with him. If you can catch that
[1:49:29] this morning, that when you have the
[1:49:31] mind of Christ anointed by the spirit,
[1:49:33] you cannot be overcome. That's what
[1:49:36] overcoming is in this age. But what did
[1:49:38] they do to Stephen? Same thing they did
[1:49:40] to Christ. If you can't beat him, kill
[1:49:42] him.
[1:49:44] And they did. They stoned him to death.
[1:49:45] And watch what the prophet of God says.
[1:49:47] He says, "Then God saw his little
[1:49:48] advertisement board being taken down."
[1:49:51] Steven looked up to heaven, said,
[1:49:52] "Behold, I see heavens open and Jesus
[1:49:54] standing on the right hand of God." And
[1:49:56] he fell asleep in the arms of God. He
[1:49:58] was an advertisement board for a hungry
[1:50:00] world. Now, catch this.
[1:50:03] This struck me so hard. Well, how many
[1:50:06] were there? You said was maybe 5,000.
[1:50:09] How many of them got saved?
[1:50:13] He said there was one
[1:50:17] he said and he never accepted it right
[1:50:19] then but years later he says hallelujah
[1:50:22] somewhere your influence never dies.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Parents we raise our children in the
[1:50:28] fear and admonition of the Lord. Some
[1:50:31] stay, some go, but your influence never
[1:50:34] dies.
[1:50:35] There is something that lingers in the
[1:50:37] back of their mind until the day they go
[1:50:40] that knows the truth. And our trust is
[1:50:43] that the word says when they're old,
[1:50:45] they won't turn away. They'll figure out
[1:50:48] that his way is the best way. Your
[1:50:50] influence never dies. The thing is
[1:50:52] Steven never saw that influence. He died
[1:50:56] not knowing that he literally converted
[1:50:59] Paul
[1:51:01] with his testimony.
[1:51:03] Wow. His death converted Paul.
[1:51:08] Now, Paul needed an experience with
[1:51:09] Christ, don't get me wrong, but it was
[1:51:12] Steven's testimony that set Paul on an
[1:51:15] edge. And there was a little something.
[1:51:17] His heart was pricricked.
[1:51:21] There was a little something that
[1:51:22] started in there and he was at unrest
[1:51:25] and he fought it for so long until
[1:51:28] finally he gave in. He said, "There was
[1:51:31] one that held the coat. Saul, that young
[1:51:32] Pharisee standing there, consulted and
[1:51:35] gave witness, consented and gave witness
[1:51:36] to his death. He says, "But when he saw
[1:51:38] that advertisement of the power of the
[1:51:40] resurrected Christ and that little
[1:51:42] fellow, it never got away from him."
[1:51:44] That same man, Paul, that one standing
[1:51:46] there that morning, led tens of
[1:51:48] thousands of souls to Christ because one
[1:51:50] man was willing to give his life to be
[1:51:53] an advertising board for Jesus Christ.
[1:51:57] Oh, well, that's Stephen. He says, "What
[1:51:59] ought we to do today?" No matter. We
[1:52:01] don't have to have big audiences. We
[1:52:03] don't have to preach to 10,000. We don't
[1:52:05] have to even preach. We can be God's
[1:52:08] advertisement board. He says, "How do
[1:52:11] you know that your life might not start
[1:52:12] some young man on the gospel?" Some of
[1:52:14] you older men, see old women, start some
[1:52:17] young man on the field out there would
[1:52:18] win 10,000 souls to Christ because that
[1:52:21] he saw Christ in you that you presented
[1:52:25] Christ to him in the simple power of the
[1:52:29] gospel.
[1:52:30] He says, "How did Stephen Steven Stephen
[1:52:32] do it?" Now, he's talking about that
[1:52:34] moment when Steven died. Amen. Not his
[1:52:37] life before. He's pointing to the effect
[1:52:38] on Saul. But remember, Steven did signs
[1:52:40] and wonders. Scripture makes it clear.
[1:52:42] But watch what he says. He says he never
[1:52:44] performed any miracles, though he knew
[1:52:45] that Christ was a miracle performer.
[1:52:47] Steven didn't use his power to try and
[1:52:49] get himself out.
[1:52:51] He said he knew all those powers and
[1:52:53] things. But what did he do? He just
[1:52:55] presented his life in such a way that
[1:52:56] they saw that it was the power of
[1:52:58] Christ. This is for us this morning. You
[1:53:01] may never see a vision. You may never
[1:53:04] put your hands on a sick person and feel
[1:53:06] the charge of Almighty God make a
[1:53:08] skeleton of a man turn back to life
[1:53:09] again. You may never see him standing
[1:53:12] yondering three or four rainbows. You
[1:53:14] may never see his image. You may never
[1:53:17] hear his voice. But still, you can be a
[1:53:20] signboard that will reflect Jesus Christ
[1:53:23] by a life that's so pure and
[1:53:25] unadulterated from the world. He says,
[1:53:27] "Not clumber cluttered up with dirty
[1:53:29] things around your life, but a pure
[1:53:31] thing that it'll cause the hungry heart
[1:53:34] to hunger and thirst to be like,
[1:53:39] "Oh, you."
[1:53:43] Why? Because they don't know it's
[1:53:44] Christ.
[1:53:46] All they know is she's got something
[1:53:48] that I like. That guy lives his life in
[1:53:51] a way that I wish I lived. That guy has
[1:53:53] his family in such a beautiful way. I
[1:53:55] wish mine was that way.
[1:53:57] church. The only Christ they're going to
[1:53:59] see is you and I.
[1:54:01] He says, "You're the salt of the earth.
[1:54:04] If the salt has lost its savor,
[1:54:05] wherewith shall it be salted?"
[1:54:11] My wife went camping with the boys for a
[1:54:13] few days this week. They were at a
[1:54:15] soccer tournament as well. Came back
[1:54:18] yesterday and she was saying, you know,
[1:54:19] they were having a party afterwards, but
[1:54:21] they didn't invite us.
[1:54:23] She said there was going to be beer
[1:54:24] there, so it's probably just as well.
[1:54:29] I don't know why they didn't. Maybe it's
[1:54:31] cuz they know they ain't going to come.
[1:54:34] They're not here on Sundays. They're
[1:54:35] probably not going to go around drinking
[1:54:36] beer. We've got to be okay with being
[1:54:39] rejected,
[1:54:41] overlooked,
[1:54:43] and not be offended in it.
[1:54:46] Not be offended in it. It's not
[1:54:48] personal. It's not personal. They may be
[1:54:51] doing it out of respect. We never know.
[1:54:55] He says, "That's right. Hungering and
[1:54:56] thirsting. Let your light so shine
[1:54:58] before men that they may see your good
[1:55:00] works, see what you do, and glorify the
[1:55:02] father that's in heaven." He says,
[1:55:04] "Hungering, signboards, reflecting,
[1:55:07] wonderful."
[1:55:08] We don't have to have big organizations
[1:55:10] to sell Christ.
[1:55:13] We don't have to have highly educated
[1:55:15] preachers and highly polished people,
[1:55:17] their mayors, and the different things
[1:55:18] of the city. What we have to have is
[1:55:21] Christ. And Christ sells himself. He
[1:55:25] says, "You book Christ into a man's
[1:55:26] heart. You don't have to tell him you
[1:55:28] have to join this organization or that
[1:55:30] one." He says, "He's already sold on the
[1:55:32] product." Now, remember just as we're
[1:55:35] closing this morning, you remember he
[1:55:38] was working for the utility company and
[1:55:41] they said, "Hey, we've got all these
[1:55:42] lamps we're trying to sell and there's a
[1:55:45] prize for the person that sells them the
[1:55:46] most." And he said, "Now, is this lamp
[1:55:48] guaranteed? Does it have a warranty? do
[1:55:51] you guarantee that they'll be satisfied
[1:55:53] with it? The guy said, "Yes." He says,
[1:55:55] "So if they don't like it, they can they
[1:55:57] can give it back and they'll get their
[1:55:58] money back." He said, "Absolutely, 100%.
[1:56:01] We guarantee it." He says, "Okay." He
[1:56:02] says, "And I filled my truck full of
[1:56:04] them." And as I went around the houses
[1:56:06] getting bills and checking meters and
[1:56:08] that, he says, "I take a lamp and I get
[1:56:09] say to the person, hey, they say, well,
[1:56:11] I already paid my bill." He says, "No,
[1:56:13] no, no. I'm not here for that. I'm here
[1:56:14] to give you a lamp." Well, I don't have
[1:56:15] money for a lamp. He says, "You don't
[1:56:17] have to pay money." He says, 'I just
[1:56:18] want to leave it here and when I come
[1:56:20] back next month, you let me know if you
[1:56:21] want to keep it or not. He said, '
[1:56:22] Because they told me the lamp was
[1:56:24] guaranteed,
[1:56:26] he says. And I knew what that lamp
[1:56:27] looked like. I knew the soft life of put
[1:56:29] light put out. He says, I knew that if
[1:56:30] they just had it for a while, they'd
[1:56:32] like it. He says, so I didn't make them
[1:56:34] pay for the lamp. He says, I just put
[1:56:35] them gave him the lamp and said, if you
[1:56:36] don't like it, I'll come pick it up. He
[1:56:38] says, and I won the contest. No, no
[1:56:40] problem. He said, because I didn't try
[1:56:41] and sell them on the product. The
[1:56:43] product sold itself. Amen. When we have
[1:56:46] people asking us, "Where do you go to
[1:56:48] church? What do you believe? Why are you
[1:56:51] the way you are?" Church, we're not here
[1:56:53] to sell a product. We're not here to
[1:56:56] sell a lifestyle. We're not here to sell
[1:56:58] a community. We're not here as an
[1:57:00] advertising agency trying to get
[1:57:02] business.
[1:57:04] Amen. This is not a This is not commerce
[1:57:06] for us. Amen. If they're asking church,
[1:57:09] it's because they like the product
[1:57:11] already.
[1:57:12] What did they say? remember was it uh it
[1:57:15] was Philip under the tree when Nathaniel
[1:57:17] came to him and he says hey we found the
[1:57:19] Messiah is Jesus of Nazareth he said can
[1:57:21] anything good come out of Nazareth
[1:57:24] can anything good come out of that hey
[1:57:25] I've heard bad things about that church
[1:57:28] what did Philip say or what did
[1:57:29] Nathaniel say come and see come and see
[1:57:33] for yourself church we're not here to
[1:57:35] convince people in or out
[1:57:38] zero worries about whether people come
[1:57:40] or go because I can't keep them in and I
[1:57:44] can't push them out. It's all a work of
[1:57:47] God. Amen. We don't have to make people
[1:57:49] see every truth the day they walk
[1:57:51] through our doors.
[1:57:53] We didn't. We're still growing. We're
[1:57:56] still learning. We're still maturing. We
[1:57:58] got to give them the same opportunity.
[1:58:00] Church, we don't want to force somebody
[1:58:02] into baptism. We want them to fall in
[1:58:04] love with the Christ that will get them
[1:58:06] into the water. I'd rather you fall in
[1:58:08] love with Christ and then get baptized
[1:58:10] rather than get baptized and then fall
[1:58:11] in love with Christ.
[1:58:12] There's got to be something on the
[1:58:14] inside. There's got to be a hunger and a
[1:58:16] thirst. And as long as they're hungering
[1:58:17] and thirsting, God can do something with
[1:58:19] them. Amen. We just have to be salty. We
[1:58:22] just have to keep them thirsty for God.
[1:58:25] And he'll take care of the rest. What is
[1:58:28] that? What does that mind of Christ look
[1:58:29] like in a believer? It's that simple,
[1:58:32] humble, victorious daily life.
[1:58:36] It's not some big show. It's being
[1:58:39] faithful to God day in and day out. It's
[1:58:43] not drawing attention to itself. It's
[1:58:45] not putting yourself up on a pedestal.
[1:58:47] It's just a humble life. But yet, it's
[1:58:49] Christ. That's all that we're doing.
[1:58:51] Amen. There is no The scripture says
[1:58:52] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:58:54] him. Jesus of Nazareth was not a
[1:58:57] handsome man. He was plain,
[1:59:01] normal, bland perhaps.
[1:59:04] Maybe he was even ugly. Who knows? But
[1:59:07] one thing we know, he wasn't a handsome
[1:59:08] man. People aren't coming to us, church,
[1:59:11] because we look amazing.
[1:59:13] But they come to us because they're
[1:59:14] hungering and thirsting for the things
[1:59:16] that we have.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let your life be a sermon.
[1:59:22] Let your life be the sermon that people
[1:59:24] see. Then they'll listen to your words.
[1:59:27] But if all we're doing is talking,
[1:59:29] there's so many voices. There's so many
[1:59:30] podcasts. There's so many shows. There's
[1:59:32] so many commentators. There's so many
[1:59:34] speakers these days. Our voice will just
[1:59:36] get blended in with the rest. But a life
[1:59:38] lived
[1:59:40] according to the word. That's what's
[1:59:41] going to get their attention. Amen.
[1:59:46] I have this quote in my Bible and I want
[1:59:48] to close with it today.
[1:59:51] He says, "Oh, how we need thousands of
[1:59:54] lived voices.
[1:59:57] The thunder of God thundering out." Now,
[2:00:00] what we just had a thunder and lightning
[2:00:02] storm, didn't we? After Wednesday
[2:00:03] service,
[2:00:05] somebody said, "Brother John was
[2:00:06] thundering over the pulpit and then God
[2:00:08] came behind and vindicated it in a
[2:00:09] storm.
[2:00:16] I wish."
[2:00:20] But I don't know what you guys did, but
[2:00:22] I went home and I cracked open the door
[2:00:24] because the kids went to sleep. I
[2:00:26] cracked open that door and I just sat
[2:00:28] under that thunder and lightning for
[2:00:30] about 10 minutes and just enjoyed the
[2:00:32] shaking and the booming and the
[2:00:34] crackling and the oh it was just it was
[2:00:37] amazing the power and the the the sonic
[2:00:40] force of a thunder and lightning storm.
[2:00:43] I mean absolutely phenomenal. Eddie
[2:00:45] Shear said that we got more he believes
[2:00:48] they have more lightning in that one. Um
[2:00:51] Eddie Shear is a meteorologist here in
[2:00:53] case you didn't know. said, "We got more
[2:00:55] lightning strikes in that one storm than
[2:00:57] we had, I think, in the previous five or
[2:00:59] seven years combined."
[2:01:02] The longest lasting storm he's ever
[2:01:03] remembered in Newfoundland history, as
[2:01:05] long as he's been alive. But we think of
[2:01:08] thunder and lightning and it's all force
[2:01:10] and it's raw power. You see that
[2:01:13] crackling, they they just recorded the
[2:01:15] longest um the longest lightning uh
[2:01:18] streak in in recorded history and it was
[2:01:21] something like 2,000 miles long through
[2:01:22] the clouds. They caught it on satellite
[2:01:26] down in the United States on the eastern
[2:01:27] seabboard. We think about it and we
[2:01:29] think that thunder and lightning is all
[2:01:31] power. It's raw. It's blunt force.
[2:01:35] But capture what he says now.
[2:01:38] The thunder of God thundering out in
[2:01:40] sweetness
[2:01:42] and holiness,
[2:01:44] purity, undefiled lives, walking around
[2:01:48] in the earth today without a blemish.
[2:01:52] He says, 'Yes, sir, real Christians,
[2:01:54] that's thunder against the enemy. The
[2:01:56] devil doesn't care how loud you can
[2:01:58] holler. The devil doesn't care how much
[2:02:00] you can jump or how much you can do this
[2:02:02] or shout. He says, "But what hurts the
[2:02:04] devil is to see that sanctified holy
[2:02:08] life consecrated to God." He says, "Say
[2:02:11] anything to him, call him anything, he's
[2:02:14] just as sweet as it can be." And moves
[2:02:16] right on. He says, "Oh my." That throws
[2:02:19] him away. That's the thunder that shakes
[2:02:22] the devil. Amen. God bless you. Let's
[2:02:25] stand this morning. I love that that
[2:02:28] phrase there. He says, "We need
[2:02:29] thousands of lived voices."
[2:02:33] Amen. How how often do we see today, and
[2:02:35] I I know it's probably been pre
[2:02:37] prevalent in every age, but today we got
[2:02:40] people saying one thing and doing the
[2:02:41] other. You know, I saw something that
[2:02:43] they're putting an act through Congress
[2:02:44] in the United States that forbids their
[2:02:47] members of Congress to trade on the
[2:02:49] stock markets. And they compared the the
[2:02:52] members of the top members of Congress
[2:02:55] to preeminent investors like Warren
[2:02:59] Buffett.
[2:03:01] And we saw people like the speaker of
[2:03:04] the house or the ex- speaker of the
[2:03:05] house, I don't know if she still is, was
[2:03:07] beating Warren Buffett.
[2:03:10] Not not just a little bit, double,
[2:03:12] triple, quadruple returns in her stocks
[2:03:16] and and bonds compared to the best
[2:03:18] investor in the world. How? Saying one
[2:03:22] thing and doing another.
[2:03:24] Prophet God's talking here. He says
[2:03:26] lived voices. People that live what they
[2:03:28] say. People that do what they confess
[2:03:31] they believe. That's what he's looking
[2:03:33] for. And we're going to preach on this
[2:03:35] at some point in this series together.
[2:03:37] Amen. God's got people that are living
[2:03:40] voices. We're the final voice to the
[2:03:42] final age. That's what our prophet said.
[2:03:44] The final voice to the final age. And
[2:03:46] look what he says. It's thundering out
[2:03:48] how sweetness,
[2:03:50] holiness,
[2:03:52] purity. People ought to be able to see.
[2:03:55] They're set aside. They don't do the
[2:03:58] things we do. They don't go the places
[2:04:00] we go. They don't have the priorities we
[2:04:02] have. They don't seek the things we
[2:04:04] seek. They don't fight for the things we
[2:04:06] fight for.
[2:04:07] There's a rest. There's an assurance.
[2:04:09] There's a sweetness in their life that I
[2:04:11] wish we had. That's what draws people to
[2:04:14] us. Amen. We got to live what we
[2:04:16] believe, not just talk about it. Amen.
[2:04:19] Paul said, "Listen, you are our epistles
[2:04:22] seen and read of all men. You're the
[2:04:26] word walking around. They may never go
[2:04:29] to church, but you're the Christ that
[2:04:30] they're going to see." What a
[2:04:32] responsibility we have this morning.
[2:04:36] The only that this world will probably
[2:04:38] see. God, help us. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:04:41] heads. Heavenly Father,
[2:04:47] Lord,
[2:04:49] we want to be a lived voice,
[2:04:53] Lord. Not just a
[2:04:56] tinkling symbol,
[2:04:58] clanging brass, making a noise,
[2:05:02] Lord, but we want to have a life that is
[2:05:04] a reality of this word.
[2:05:06] Lord, that people could look at us and
[2:05:08] see that there's something different,
[2:05:10] Lord. And it's not pride or arrogance or
[2:05:13] ego that pulls them in, Lord, but it's
[2:05:14] the simplicity and the humility of a
[2:05:17] life surrender to you, heavenly father.
[2:05:20] Lord, I pray that as we walk around, as
[2:05:22] people see the way we are, the way our
[2:05:24] families are, the way our kids act, the
[2:05:26] way we dress, where we go, how we spend
[2:05:29] our money, how we spend our time, Lord,
[2:05:31] that they would see clearly this is a
[2:05:33] separated people, that they are
[2:05:35] different,
[2:05:38] Lord. We want people to see you,
[2:05:40] Lord. And that means we need to have you
[2:05:42] in our lives in a greater way than we've
[2:05:44] ever had before, Lord. This world is so
[2:05:46] dark and it's closing in. Lord, we pray
[2:05:49] that you help our light to shine all the
[2:05:51] brighter, that we keep our lamps
[2:05:52] trimmed, Lord, that we have a daily
[2:05:54] relationship, a daily filling, Lord, a
[2:05:57] daily closeness with you, Lord, that
[2:05:59] just shines through all this dark and
[2:06:00] filth that's in this world. Lord, I pray
[2:06:03] you help us to surrender. Help us to
[2:06:06] repent, Lord. Lord, where we've clogged
[2:06:08] up our lamps, Lord, where we're not
[2:06:10] burning as brightly. Lord, I pray you
[2:06:12] help us to trim the wick, Lord, to
[2:06:14] change our ways, Lord, according to your
[2:06:16] word and give you the full preeminence
[2:06:17] in our lives. Lord, we want to be a
[2:06:20] witness for you. Grant us grace, Lord.
[2:06:22] Give us strength. Give us courage. Give
[2:06:24] us, Lord, a sweetness, a desire for
[2:06:26] souls, Lord, that would draw people to
[2:06:28] you. We pray in Jesus Christ's name
[2:06:31] we're asking it. Amen. Amen. Do we know
[2:06:36] that song? Jesus. I really want to see.
[2:06:40] We do or we don't.
[2:06:43] We We'll move on. Let's just do the
[2:06:45] goodness of God. 1254.
[2:06:48] [Music]
[2:06:53] I love you, Lord.
[2:06:58] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:07:04] And all my days
[2:07:07] I've been held in your hands.
[2:07:13] From the moment that I wake up
[2:07:18] until I lay my head.

[2:08:18] you are close like no other.
[2:08:24] I've known you as a father.
[2:08:28] I've known you as a friend.
[2:08:32] Oh, I'm a Catholic
[2:08:35] in the goodness
[2:08:38] of God.

[2:09:14] Hallelujah.
[2:09:20] For your mercy and praise me.
[2:09:26] All my days

[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[2:10:35] in the darkest night.

[2:12:10] just really strikes me. It's uh that

[2:31:16] voice that
[2:31:18] the voice that knocks on the heart's
[2:31:21] door
[2:31:23] that calls back to the soul.
[2:31:29] And Lord, in our hearts, Lord, we feel
[2:31:31] the effect, the call of the Holy Spirit,
[2:31:38] Lord God, and bring a stir to our
[2:31:40] hearts, Lord.
[2:31:43] something, oh God, that a call of an
[2:31:46] awakening, Lord. A thirsting desire,
[2:31:49] Lord,
[2:31:51] one of which, Lord God, we recognize
[2:31:53] that cannot be filled with the desires
[2:31:56] of this world
[2:31:59] and more in abundance, Lord God, Lord,
[2:32:01] in response to that call this morning.
[2:32:05] Lord God, the greatest we can do this
[2:32:07] morning, Lord, is to surrender our
[2:32:09] hearts and
[2:32:11] and to open the channel, Lord God, that
[2:32:13] we can have true fellowship and
[2:32:15] relationship.
[2:32:17] The Lord God, we can have more of you,
[2:32:20] Lord, in this dying world, in a time, oh
[2:32:23] God, where it seems so impossible.
[2:32:27] But yet Lord God in this call in this
[2:32:30] thirsting in the heart desiring
[2:32:34] Lord God Lord only you can quench the
[2:32:37] thirsting desiring of our soul.
[2:32:40] And so God we call back to you this
[2:32:43] morning Lord we say come Lord even so
[2:32:47] Lord Jesus come Lord fill our hearts
[2:32:50] Lord God.
[2:32:52] may not be hustle, Lord God, but as you
[2:32:55] create the thirst, as brother Bernham
[2:32:57] declares, Lord, he said, if there's a
[2:33:00] thirsting for God, there's more an
[2:33:02] abundance of God to give. And there's a
[2:33:05] reason why, Lord God, you have created
[2:33:07] this holy thirst in our hearts, Lord
[2:33:10] God. That you can come in, Lord, and
[2:33:12] fill our hearts with your presence.
[2:33:16] Lord God, as one writerly declares to be
[2:33:18] filled with your goodness and to be lost
[2:33:20] in your love,
[2:33:22] oh God, Lord, we are crying this. Oh,
[2:33:26] hallelujah.
[2:33:28] Because Lord, it's a dying world. It's a
[2:33:31] time, oh God, that is leaning more, Lord
[2:33:33] God, over the godlessness, Lord God.
[2:33:36] It's an empty world, Lord God, with
[2:33:39] empty promises. There there's nothing
[2:33:41] here that can fill the voids. Oh God,
[2:33:45] only you this morning. And and as your
[2:33:48] people, Lord God, we return our
[2:33:50] attention to heaven this morning, Lord
[2:33:53] God, from whence the resources of our
[2:33:55] fate, oh God, from whence we can be fail
[2:33:58] this morning. Come this morning, Lord.
