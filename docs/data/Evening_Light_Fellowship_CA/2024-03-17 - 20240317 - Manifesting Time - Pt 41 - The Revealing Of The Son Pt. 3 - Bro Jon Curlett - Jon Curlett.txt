amen God bless you turn if you would to Psalms chapter 1 amen good to be here this morning and my voice is about 90% I wouldn't want to sing for very long but I can sing a little bit now and so we're trusting the Lord to just continue working in that amen got to see brother Ivan just for a little bit yesterday and he's very tired he's very sore and and just dealing with some things so uh we want to keep him in prayer amen that God will just touch him and then we went over to see sister Betty it was her 73rd birthday yesterday and she was the smilest and the happiest I think I've ever seen her in my life so God has truly blessed her in this touch on her body and in her healing and and she's in good spirits and a good attitude and just it was a good time so we thank the Lord for that as well sister Darlene is good to see you again God bless you amen want to have a quick announcement this morning so we've settled on the special meetings the dedication meetings for this year it'll be July 4th through 7th That's Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday will do one service each evening and then the service on Sunday morning as usual brother Paul lantame will be preaching for us and brother Jerry Fury will be coming from Alberta to preach for us brother Jerry will lead brother Paul will take the second service and they'll alternate through the rest of the weekend so we want to remember them in prayer amen as that uh as that comes up so we'll be maybe putting together a little flyer that we can put out and send out by mail or electronically if you want to send it to people so they've got that and uh and we'll be uh looking forward to that amen amen it's good to have Selena back as well from her trip in Edmonton amen it's good to have a full church this morning amen God bless you each one Psalm chapter 1 Psalm chapter 1 says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seed of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bring forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing in our series on manifesting time and I'm taking a third series or third uh service on this this title of the revealing of the son of man and I want to pick up right where we left off last service we're talking about adoption of course and we said adoption is the revealing of the attribute revealing of the purpose revealing of the word of God and it's being expressed in us and it's the it's the thought of God that he had for us before the foundation of the world coming into reality in its Earthly fullness and this happens we know adoption happens when God can trust us fully and I want to just get into just a a bit of a side note here before we start this service because we can look at adoption and so many things and we speak about power and we speak about Authority and all these things but adoption is about expressing Christ not me it's about expressing Christ not you it's about expressing the word so it is not power and adoption where we take our thoughts and our minds as we would say naturally or carnally but rather when we come to adoption our being is so surrendered to his that when we think it is not our thoughts it is his thoughts when we speak it is not his words it is our words our attitude is his attitude our reaction is his reaction it is a son or daughter of God that is completely a and fully uh surrendered to the holy spirit in their lives amen in other words an adopted son or daughter of God will reveal Christ it won't reveal them it'll reveal Christ now it's God working through us and in our little quirks and in our little personalities and these different things you can see that even in the disciples you had the fiery ones you had the calm ones you had the the the The Quiet Ones you had the introspective ones you had the ones that would go out and and just run right up to something you know Bulldog Faith like Peter had then you had John the quieter more introspective one but the holy spirit in each one of them projected Christ it revealed Christ in their time amen and we know that his children were an expression of the father each and every one of us and and my boys and my daughter even no matter how much they might not want to they have to express me because there's a part of me inside of them and it's built into them and and we're no different we all have the same father amen we all have the same DNA and what is it it's the word DNA it's Christ the word inside of us so we're word born that's what the new birth is is it we are word born by the Holy Spirit and therefore the word has to be what comes out of our life life now we can see this in the Old Testament as we talk about the revealing of the son and really it's the revealing of the father through the son or through the child and we can see this in the lives of the Believers in the Old Testament and we see there the types and shadows and that's all it is is types and shadows it's not perfect but it's a reflection of what's supposed to happen in the New Testament under the law nothing could be perfect but it could be a type and it could be a shadow and brother Brown would say this he's speaking of of Christ he says he expressed himself in Joseph born amongst denomination his Brethren they hated him without a cause because he was spiritual he saw visions and God was with them now Joseph was unproven Joseph had had not really done anything great in his life he had made no great decisions and yet God was with him why he was a child of God and it's that simple amen he could interpret dreams and his brothers hated him he was sold by his Brethren by almost 30 pieces of SE silver just exactly like he was sold by Judas a scariot one of his Brethren by 30 pieces of silver he was thrown into a ditch and supposed to be dead that he's thrown into that ditch and then he's taken up and from there he went to the right hand of pharaoh okay we're speaking of the revealing of Christ the revealing of the son he says in the dudgeon how he suffered there the Butler and the baker one of them lost and one was saved one of them lost the other one saved just as on the cross when he was in his prison house tacked to the cross for our sins and became a prisoner one Thief was lost and one was saved see it's just exactly then he Joseph would come to the right hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed that had the vision that he would sit at the king's feet and all authority in Egypt was given to him his vision had come to pass then he steps back he says he might have studied of it many times while he was in that prison down there his whiskers growing out and so forth but he studied it he said because someday his vision had to come to pass though it linger it's got to happen when God said so it's got to happen he says it's a Vindicated prophet and it has to come to pass because it's God's word today Joseph went through years and years of sitting under the vision without the Fulfillment but what he didn't realize was in the time that it was darkest the vision was still being fulfilled the situation was preparing him for the vision to be fulfilled but Joseph understood it Joseph understood it I'm asking you church this morning where is your vision what is the prophecy what is the word you're sitting under because we can sit here so many times and say nothing's happening nothing's moving the prophecy has gone forth the message of the the hour has come forth we've received our last sign Christ is here in the bride what's happening and we're stuck in this and we're stuck in that we're stuck in our sickness in our minds and our attitudes and our families whatever it might be but Joseph had the attitude through all of those things he understood God is with me God gave me the word God gave me the vision therefore it has to come to pass even when it doesn't look like anything's happening amen that's where we're sitting this morning is we're under a vision we're under an end time Vision we're under the Book of Revelation and we're under Revelations 10 we've moved from 107 into 108 where we take the book and we prophesy and things happen according to the word that God has already given that he's already declared to us this morning amen that's where we're sitting though it lingers notice it says though it lingers it's got to happen we can sit there and we can't focus on the lingering we've got to focus on the it's got to happen because it is the unchanging unfailing word of God this morning it doesn't fail his word cannot return unto him void and Joseph knew he had a real gift he had a real vision and he knew the vision had to come into fruition so whether he was in Piper's house a slave or whether he was in prison a slave the vision still had to come to pass where you at this morning whether you're in a prison house it feels like or whether you're on top of the mountain it matters not the vision has to come to pass the word has to come forth he says now we find Joseph then that no man could touch or come to Pharaoh without first seen Joseph no man can come to the father only by his son and when Joseph left the throne they sounded Trump every knee bow Joseph is coming forth Glory says someday every knee will bow and every tongue will confess when he leaves the Throne of his father see to come forth everybody will bear witness that he's the son of God he says it's too late then do it now amen I said last service there's Mercy now but there comes a time where the scripture says let's he let he that's holy be holy still and he that's filthy be filthy still there is no changing There's No Going Back you are what you are then he says now we notice through the types we could take even David going off his throne rejected by his own people going up the same Mountain the Mount of Olives as he's going over to his prison he was going to his prison house because he was rejected of his Brethren and of his own people he went up weeping he says that was the spirit of Christ in him to be rejected see we want the revealing of Christ in us but it's the full thing we have to suffer as he suffered amen if we're going to reign with him we got to suffer with him and the spirit of Christ in us will take us through that suffering the same as it'll take us through the victory he says as he looked up over Jerusalem and wept and said Jerusalem how of a rejected King 800 years later the son of David stood on Jerusalem up above there and rejected and wept over Jerusalem and said now your hour has come he says that's right now catch this this is in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says all those SA typed him just in type but he says but yet the mystery was hid Now Catch This those men didn't know what they were doing he says they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do some now holding it back in the last days God he was holding it back in the last days for the great Revelation but expressing it expressing himself in Moses and David and Joseph and Elijah on down through we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it it express Jesus Christ perfectly and exactly yet he says never giving his secret in full waiting to make it known when in the last day as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it we in the time and in the season and the promise of full comprehension full realization amen full adoption full Redemption now we can look at those men and and we can say Amen cuz it's history and we can see the words written and we can see you know that we have hindsight is 2020 we can Monday Morning Quarterback it we can see what they did and we've seen what Christ did and we can see how all those prophecies lined up and they had the same attitude same cry in their hearts the same Victory and all of those elements were portrayed amen but let's not just leave it with the man and that's not just leave it with the ministers or the prophets because we can also see a bride of Christ traveling through those pages of the scriptures amen and we can see it starts with Eve and so often what happens is we put Eve out because of her failure but you have to realize that Eve was the mystery revealing of the fullness of God because remember what the scripture says in Genesis it says God created Man In His Image he says what he said in the image of God created he him there's the mystery but then he says male and female created he them that's the mystery revealed the mystery was inside of him Adam but then the mystery was pulled out and now you see two there not just one amen that's what was happening there and we see that it's Christ and a bride being revealed because Adam and his bride under the same name as we are the same name of Christ was the revealing of the fullness of God that was the image of God fully revealed was Adam and his bride under the same name amen but we see that now through scriptures we see Hannah we see Mary we see Ruth and and then we go and we see Rahab the The Prostitute yet no less the type of the bride of Christ showing it doesn't matter if you're raised in church or you're raised on the streets if you come in broken or you come in just just as clean as you could possibly come in it matters not there is a bride that is being prepared and we can see the shadows and the types all through scriptures amen we know what happened uh uh at Calvary was that Christ was smoked and out of his side came what water and blood it's the life in the spirit it's the life of the word that came out it was the bride being brought out of him and we see what happened on the day of Pentecost was what that God poured himself into that church to make her live remember he took a side he took a rib out of Adam and he made it live then what did he do take out of Christ he took something out of his side and he made it live on the day of Pentecost amen so today we've got a redeemed bride a spotless bride a bride without wrinkle and what is it we had Alpha in the day of Pentecost when he poured his Spirit out and now he's pouring his Spirit out again in the Omega age and it's the same Christ being revealed in the same kind of Bride and the same kind of woman amen what is it it's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh body of his body Spirit of his spirit it's word upon word it's the exact same thing there is no difference it the only difference is the portion that each and you and I have but we're made from the exact same thing look at what Paul said Paul's the greatest preacher aside from Christ he has the full revelation of the whole mystery you can look in Paul and he reveals the bride perfectly he reveals Christ perfectly listen he says this in his age this is the alpha Church remember Christ is Alpha and Omega here's the alpha he says do we begin to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of recommendation to you or letters of com ation Commendation he says as Ministry do we need to come in and have some brother vouch for us he says you are our Epistles written in our hearts he says you're the letters you're the proof you're the Commendation he says and you're known and read of all men for as much he says as you are manifestly declared that means you are the visible the apparent declaration it is literally the revealing of the mystery it's the reality of the word that he preached he says you are manifestly declared to be the what Epistle of Paul no the Epistle of Christ he says you are the work you are the account you are the letter of Christ you are the literal embodiment of Christ it's you today he says he says Minister by us the preaching of the word you've got to sit under it because it produces an Epistle of Christ amen he says written not with ink but with what the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy in fleshly natural bodies in tables of the heart now listen to what the prophet of God said he says then see God came down and the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible in the beginning was God he says he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship the only thing he was was the Eternal and in him were attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and word was made manifest what is it he says it's all God becoming tangible he says and you are a part of God you're a tangible part of God you are the Epistles of Christ seen and read of all men he says and Jesus came to redeem those that were on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem he says then as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there but if the life isn't in there then what can they do they don't see it they'll never see it and the whole thing is Jesus said at that day he says if they see it and then brother Braham says now the whole thing is the whole purpose of this is at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me he says the whole thing is God becoming material now we're speaking of adoption but watch what brother Bram does here this is 1964 after the opening of the seals he's understanding there's a shift and there we'll see this as we go through adoption is there's there's this blending of the sunship and the daughter ship of adopted sons and daughters and the brideship because it's the same thing but it's in two different types and shadows and he doesn't say it's like adopted Sons he says it's like a husband and wife becoming one together God and His Church becoming one what is it it's God becoming the fullness of material expressed in flesh amen it's God expressed God revealing himself and it's in a love relationship that was the Perfect Image in the Garden of Eden that's what Christ is being revealed as that's the full revealing of God is Christ with his bride Amen brother Brown would say this he says you're a part of God I'm a part of God see but I'm not all of God and neither are you all of God see he says it's attributes of God upon us now as Sons adopted by Jesus Christ when before the foundation of the world they're written within you and it's the working of the holy spirit that draws this out of us amen that light of the word flashes across us the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit flashes across us and life is quickened inside of us and once it starts you can't kill it you cannot kill it it's an eternal seed of God Amen Christ came and he was the manif ested word he was the Living Word he was the real reality of the word and whether the the priesthood liked it or not he was the word and it doesn't matter whether we accept it to make it the word the word is the word and it stands alone and it proves itself amen but it was the thought of God that became flesh and the purpose of the word of God is to produce something that lives it is not a dead word it is a Living Word and its purpose is to produce living people amen this is what Jesus said he said it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing if the flesh profits nothing then why are we focused on it why do we rely on it why do we look to it why do we let it talk to us come on now it's the spirit that quickeneth he says the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life now I want you to catch something here because Spirits need bodies in other words if his words are spirit and they are life they need a body to produce life amen they need a body remember they have no natural body of their own I'll touch on godhead just for a moment because the scripture says God is a spirit he says no man has seen the father God the Father the original the great spirit if we could call that but what happened then is he he he created a body and it was the pillar of fire and that is a visible body that can interact with with Humanity we can see it with our five senses if God would open our eyes he can do it visibly many people have seen the pillar of fire amen and what was it it was God creating a body for his Spirit to dwell in and what was it that was the son of God it was the theophany of God it was the body of God and God took his spirit and he put it in that body and that became the visible God that is God in a body and that is now what that is Christ what does Christ mean the anointed one Christ is the body of God it is the fullness of God poured into that body and it was God stepping into reality so that creation could be interactive with him it was God being able to come down and touch us so Christ is the visible God he's a created body for the spirit of God to dwell in amen God a Spirit dwelling in a body and he made that body God the body became God as soon as God dwelt in it that's the only God we will ever see is Christ it is is the visible God to us amen what was it God joined himself to that body he put his Spirit within it and he he declared them to be one in the same thing Jesus said I and my father are one he was the revealing of the spirit of God inside of him that was God look at what Paul said in Colossians he says giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light catch that in light it says who had delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins he's speaking of Christ now he says who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature that's Genesis 1 amen and let's go there real quick because it says and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness amen so what happened in Genesis 1:3 is God created a pillar of fire he did not create the sun moon and stars that doesn't happen till genesis4 this is light this is the image of God being created this is the body of God being created this is the Son of God being created a son is created there is no Eternal son amen it's a body created and what happens is God stepped into that and created everything through that body now that is the embodiment of God Amen so what happened happens we see then that God put a distinction between himself and everything else and scripture says God is light and there's no variableness neither shadow of turning in him there's no change in him right and God said I am God and nothing else is God I am the standard I am the light I am the truth all of these things amen darkness is the absence of God that's all it is and without God I don't care how good it sounds how good it looks how emotionally supportive it is it isn't God God is truth he is light Amen in 1 John 1: 15 it says then this is the message that we have heard and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all so this is literally God creating a body to step into and that body is what created everything else through that body he worked it's Christ we see that in verse 16 if we go back to Colossians it says for by him who Christ he says were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist what is it it's God behind the mask it's God hidden in a body amen it's the nature the attributes of God all expressed why he's word born remember that John says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and then the Word was God that shift is when he created the word came out and it created a being and he stepped into it the word didn't just going to be with God the word became God and he stepped in and he clothed himself in his word he clothed himself in his his attributes and he became the expression the reality the Fulfillment of his own word right there in Genesis 1:3 it says now he who Christ is the head of the church what is church called out ones what happened at C he called out a bride amen what happened is he pulled them out it was Christ and the bride as a type seen in Adam and his bride in the in the Garden of Eden he says who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell in other words there's none other that has the fullness of God in them this is it this is the revelation of God is Christ amen we don't worship that body or that man but we worship the god that says this is me God wraps himself in whatever form he wants and we worship whatever he reveals to be him amen it's the full expression of God we accept it and we worship it because that's what God told us to do he revealed himself to us that way look at the way Paul says it in 2 Corinthians he says to wit that God was in Christ God was in Christ he says reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and committed unto us what the word of reconciliation that literally means the word of atonement or restoration to favor what is it it's the gospel the good news that you can come back amen that we've got full access to the throne of God Amen so we see in the beginning God needed a body and he created it and he stepped into it and he had a Heavenly Body and then he comes down and he had an Earthly body and what was it it was to express himself fully so he does it in Adam and out of Adam he pulls a bride and they fall so what does God have to do he has to go and he has to get another body remember the scripture says a body hast thou created me and God steps into it he redeems his bride and pulls out of that side another body what is it it's a bride that's prepared for him and what happens is that is that on the day of Pentecost what happens is that Pillar of Fire right which is the the literally the body of God the life of God comes down and it distributes itself over that body and it makes it live and it is what it is the revealing the full revealing of Christ it's the full revealing of God all over again just as Adam and Eve were amen and that Holy Spirit today is going and trying to find the rest of that word body cuz when the last portion of that word body comes then we get to go there's nothing to hinder now we're all together we're all baptized into that one body we can be gathered to one in Christ as the scripture requires and we can go and then all that's left is Judgment for the Gentiles at least amen so when we're born again by the Holy Spirit it shows knows where we come from because the spirit of God is seeking out what the originals the Sons and Daughters of God that were in him amen now we know the new birth is when we receive the Holy Spirit into our souls it's not a church experience it's not an atmosphere it's not an emotion it's not shouting it's not screaming it's not speaking in tongues those are all fine but they don't mean you've got the Holy Ghost by no means amen the Holy Ghost is the literal life of God coming to the believer that was the tongues of Fire coming down on the day of Pentecost it was the literal life of God coming down and distributing itself into a bride amen into a body into adopted into Sons and Daughters of God rather it's a confirmation of who we are amen it's only for Sons and Daughters of God brother B would call the Holy Ghost the token he says it's your token it's your proof that you're supposed to be going to heaven that you've got eternal life he said God's Everlasting Eternal Lo Eternal token it's eternal life by the Eternal God and anything that had a beginning has an end and everything had a beginning besides God and God is the only for form of eternal life there is and when God places his holy spirit in you which is God let let's not mince words the holy spirit is God in you he says and when God places himself within you you're as Eternal as God is why because you're a part of him because you become a son or daughter of God and you are displaying his word he says hallelujah I feel religious that's true God identifies it himself he says you've got eternal life and that is God in you now some preach that when you get the Holy Ghost you are immediately adopted that you're placed as an adopted son or an adopted daughter of God and I'm not saying that's possible because it is and we'll show it by the scriptures amen as we go through the next few service but what I am saying is that adoption always involves and the prophet would make this clear a process of training and testing and time always no exceptions you have to be proven amen if you've never been trained or tested you can't be adopted it's that simple the scriptures are very clear amen why because you haven't been proven yet now listen to what he says he says notice he's speaking when he come and the father was pleased with his son when that when that son became a certain age he took him out into a place in the street and there he adopted that same son that was born in to the family he set him up on a pinnacle a high place he had a ceremony he placed a certain fying robe upon the son and had a ceremony and adopted him into their family or otherwise he placed him in the family positionally what he was he says because he had been time tested okay it's inescapable adoption requires a timed process he says oh I wish I had the ability to grind that in the people's hearts in other words listen up God is looking for time tested Christians because every son that cometh to God must be Tri tried child trained and tested now he says this is the opposite of it and you who jump from Pillar To Post and this to that and in and out how can God ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you you if you haven't been proven to be able to even stand still how is God going to be able to use you he says he says now think of that for a moment how can you be possed ially placed when you will not stand still long enough for God to do it and me you've got to be able to sit there under the tutorage tutelage of the Holy Spirit to sit there and learn and surrender and humble yourself and when you can do that then God knows that you can be trusted and he can place you in a position of authority amen amen so God gives you the Holy Ghost with the intention of giving you at a place in adoption that is the purpose is to bring you into adoption but you have to surrender and if you don't fully surrender then God can't do anything with you you're you're sealed to the day of your Redemption you're going to heaven you're going in a Rapture but God can't do anything with you until you fully surrender those things amen now brother braham's quite clear he makes the distinction between the infilling of the Holy Spirit and the adoption of a child of God he doesn't say they can't happen at the same time but he says they are not the same thing that's a distinction that many miss it can happen at the same time but it doesn't mean they're the same thing listen to this he says now to place he says how are you he says you are first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost all right and he says and the next you are predestinated unto the what adoption what is that he says you are predestinated unto the placing he says now what is adoption he says the adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing he says when you are born again John 1:17 I believe he says when we are born of the spirit of God we are sons of God but we are predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get you to for the sons of the last day this is ours this is our message church he says we were predestinated to unto adoption he says now this is what hurts Pentecostals a little they say I got born again praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost he says fine you're a child of God that's right but yet that ain't what I'm talking about see you are predestinated unto adoption he says adoption it's placing a son to clench it out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses he says now when you receive the Holy Ghost that's one thing you're born he says but now for the ceremony of adoption two separate things amen the Holy Ghost is given to us what as a response to our faith in the word of God Amen where we obey the word we repent and be baptized what's our commandment very quickly acts 23 8 they said what do we do about this Peter he says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ well Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 to baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost what does Peter do Peter has the keys to the kingdom Peter gives us the revelation of what Jesus meant Jesus said the name what is the name of the father what is is the name of the son well we know the name of the son is Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is the pillar of fire which knocked Paul off of his horse amen and what did he say to Paul Paul said who are you he says I am Jesus so there's two are named Jesus so that means the third one must be Nam Jesus amen we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and outside of that it is a false baptism because you're baptized into a denomination you're not baptized into the word you've got to obey the word otherwise you can't remember what happened is that those those ones that got baptized under John's Revelation under John's Ministry they were baptized for the remission of sins and they were good Christians they were good Believers and and and the apostles come up and they say have you received the Holy Ghost they say we don't even know about the Holy Ghost we don't even know if there is such a thing they and the first thing they asked how are you baptized if you're lacking what's the problem because the promise is if you repent and be baptized you'll get the Holy Ghost so the the first thing they said how are you baptized they said we are baptized in John under John they said no no no no no you got to be baptized in jesus' name and as soon as they were baptized the right way the Holy Ghost fell upon them all they needed was to hear the word and respond to it amen we look so often at repentance as a mouth thing amen but repentance means to turn around it means to live a different life my sister shared something this morning and it was a minister from way back when but he said if your life hasn't changed since you gave your life to Christ since you've been saved then you have not been saved amen repentance is a confession of our life not just our mouth because remember what scripture says this people draw nigh to me with their mouth but their heart is far from me amen a heart Chang is what's needed amen and then we are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins in proper baptism and then what God responds to our faith and gives us the Holy Ghost amen that's the way it works but that baptism is gift and its power and it's meant to bring us into the full subjection of the spirit of God why so we can manifest him amen and that means we've got to get everything emptied out that's why we don't throw away a message of justification you got to have that that's what repentance does he paid the price I stand Here redeemed blameless but then there's a sanctification to empty me out because what has to happen is I've got to be filled and I've got to be filled with the right thing otherwise what comes out won't be him so there's got to be that emptying out there's got to be that cleaning out of our desire desires and our our focus and the the things that matter in our lives amen because the first thing the Holy Ghost produces is a Godly life I'm going to say it again the first thing the Holy Ghost produces is a Godly life we don't run around seeking gifts we don't run around seeking positions and Authority but rather we seek him to have what full Authority in my life amen full Authority in my life amen we sit still and we let God do a thorough work and take that empty vessel and turn it into a vessel of Honor by putting him self in it that's what makes us a vessel of honor to him where we're filled with his goodness with his will with his desires and these things amen so the Holy Ghost doesn't just have an effect it's a life effect it's a lifechanging effect and it's a change and we've covered this before so I'm not going to belabor it but I want to read just a few quotes here he says but as many as received him gave he the power to become The Offspring of God he said I give unto them eternal life that eternal life comes from the Greek word of Zoey Zoey is that life and Zoey is the life of God and if the life of God living in you he says it produces a Godly life just as certain as I'm standing in this platform and a man that's got it can no more perish than God can perish because what God is in the man that's where we're standing this afternoon church he says when a man is Anointed with the Holy Ghost here's the purpose to be adopted into the family of God to be positionally placed by the father and set into a service out here in into his purpose of life or what God called him for his walk should be no must be cuz remember we are Kings and Priests he says his W his walk must be holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy what it has to produce a Godly life before he can ever take you out and use you he says and this word is God and that word lives and produces itself just exactly what God has ordained for this age you have it Church you have it he's given it to you by the power of the holy spirit inside of you to produce the word for this age he says you have it amen the Holy Ghost the holy spirit being displayed it's meant to be on display it's supposed to be that City on a Hill a candle a light that can't be hidden amen he says yes sir what is it it's the Holy Spirit the word has been quickened to you by the Holy Spirit to vindicate this age that you have passed from Death unto life he says and now you are his what the holy spirit is vindicating your position it vindicates who your father is it in it vindicates your origin amen it's a confirmation that you are a child of God and when you get it inside of you you will act like a son and daughter of God why you will come subject to the word of God Amen if you haven't experienced with the Holy Ghost in church it'll go away cuz you'll leave the church you'll go out remember I remember when brother Michael from Toronto was here and I was talking about a church experience and the problem with a church experience is on a good day we'll take two steps up at church we've got an atmosphere we've got lots of people here the spirit of God is moving the word is being preached you know we've got a captive audience God can really do something but you go up two steps and then you go home you do nothing you're down one step then you go home and you're down another step and then you come in on a Wednesday well Wednesdays you only get one step not two cuz there's less people here kidding but then you go home and you don't do anything and you drop down again Thursday Friday Saturday then you come to Sunday and you finish your week and you're down one or two steps from where you started the week before based on a church experience it doesn't mean God's not doing something with you but you got to keep pressing the battle amen this isn't a church experience church is part of it amen we're supposed to not forsake the assembling of ourselves together in these different things but the infilling of the holy spirit is what we're looking for not just a church experience amen you get the Holy Ghost you never stop growing you never stop maturing and you never stop producing the word amen it has to come outside of you he says oh because he is we have the right to all that he has purchased for us every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you and God has sealed you he says now we want to check ourselves for a moment let's check ourselves he says when God has given you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you he says it's a new birth you are born a new of the Holy Ghost and because God has do that did this now catch this he says and you know you're no good in yourself that's the other thing the Holy Ghost will do is it'll show you there's no good thing in this flesh amen he says and you accept what God has did then he seals you into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit now listen to this he says and everything that Jesus purchased and promised you in the Bible is yours he says it's your property why because it's paid for amen he says life is mine why he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing is mine he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it Freedom's mine he paid for it Heaven is mine he paid for it he has paid the price everything he purchased belongs to the man that holds the token amen holding it in holding your confession in the word of God that Jesus Christ has died for you and when he does it he displays himself through you catch that see it's not all of this this idea of us going out and doing something but the first expression is in us and through us and he says it's healing that's Christ expressing that's God expressing himself in you it's Freedom it's liberty it's Deliverance it's provision all these things is God expressing himself through you and your life first and foremost amen whatever he does it's him showing himself through you he says amen yes when you recognize the token the life that it took for the blood to speak amen I had a friend of mine call me up on on Friday night and I was just sitting down to study and and he called me up and he says I'm at the airport flying home he works up in Labrador he says my flight is canceled do you want to meet up for some fellowship so I made my second and third trips back and forth to the airport that night and we brought him home with us and we we had some fellowship for 4 hours but he told me something on the way back to the airport that that evening and he said this he says when I was a boy my mama would make cookies for me for us he's got siblings he says and she would take those cookies and she would place them on the counter in a jar within our reach he said and mama told us if you're hungry you can have a cookie you don't have to ask me you don't have to ask anyone they're my homemade cookies I've put them there I've made them for you you can have a cookie anytime you're hungry and you know what he said he said I never had to worry was I allowed a cookie why mama had told me the cookies belong to you you can have them no doubt they were sister moren's healthy recipe amen but he says we end have to ask if they were for us if they were being saved for somebody else we got company coming you can't eat those cookies he said if they were in that jar within our reach she put them there for us to eat Church what are we saying there's cookies in the jar today amen and what happens is before the foundation of the world he wrote your name on that cookie jar and you know what you have to watch out for that man that woman that satanic influence that says those cookies ain't for you you have to be able to point them and what do you do you hold that token before you and you say he gave me the Holy Ghost I'm his son I'm his daughter and he purchased for me personally every cookie in that cookie jar so I'm going to take the one that says healing and I'm going to eat it and you can't stop me and if they try and slap your hand down you slap their hand down if you need Deliverance you take the cookie that says Deliverance if you need wisdom take the cookie that says wisdom and you say he wrote it in his own blood on the side of the cookie jar that I could go free that I could be healed that I could be delivered that I could be provided for that I could believe and expect to receive the cookie that I'm wanting this morning amen oh what's the question we've got to settle Church the question we've got to settle is is my name on the cookie jar the cookies are there the tables are full of the promises of God the only thing you got to satisfy is do they belong to me and when you get the Holy Ghost it's supposed to settle that question it's supposed to settle the question is is this for me amen what is it you say I've got the Holy Ghost this whole body is meant to be in subjection to the Holy Ghost because remember what God is God is life God is Liberty God is wisdom God is peace Joy love and it is meant for this entire body to be brought in subjection to the holy spirit that he placed inside each and every one of us amen that's what the holy spirit is supposed to do satisfy us that our name is written into those promises in the book but watch the antidote now to this Holy Spirit watch the antidote because we see this in the in the Ephesian Church Age and what they did in the Ephesian Church age was they were so worried about protecting the gospel that they formalized it you'll see it today people are so worried that their church is going to get influenced by somebody else that they just block everybody out no no no the Holy Ghost can protect the church amen as Shepherds we've certainly got to be careful but we can't put up a fence because what happens when we put up a fence is it keeps the Holy Ghost Out amen what happened to the Ephesian Church age was they put the Holy Ghost out and Men took over and God had to leave cuz God can't work when men want to have control listen to this he says the Holy Spirit comes today in like manner to present God to man he says but man wants to go to church go to a church go sit under a Ministry go get their satisfying Portion by saying I went to church today I went to church this week I went to church twice this week maybe three times this week he says that's what man wants to do amen and the only thing satisfied with the church experience is what a religious spirit 100% And that's what leoda is full of and the only cure is repentance to recognize that my satisfaction is in going to church it's not in Christ he says it drowns his thinking he cannot fa fathom it and we must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception God is known by the New Birth by the Holy Ghost not by any other way Jesus the Bible is plainly quoted to us that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost why because you're anointed with the same thing he had Christ means anointed how can you call him the anointed if you don't have the experience of being anointed yourself that's the proving of his anointing is your anointing because the same thing that's on him comes on you just in a lesser in a lesser amount he says but if you've never received the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is the Christ for that's the only way he reveals himself he says you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said so and after Peter had been both saved been both sa both both been saved and Sanctified given power to cast out unclean spirits to preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not converted until he received the Holy Ghost and then he said after you're converted then strengthen your brethren that was on the night of the Betrayal that he was not yet converted he says and no man is truly converted until he has been changed and died to himself some get changed but changed for the worse cuz what it does is they get a religious spirit rather than the Holy Spirit and they're what twofold more a child of Hell the scripture says he says and the H one you got to change you got to change the right way two die to himself and then three the Holy Spirit has control of that Spirit of that person rather they don't want to do it now listen to this he says now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another now we can take that and run and we go to standards and say well her skirt isn't as long as my skirt therefore she doesn't have the Holy Ghost and his music is not the same as my music therefore he doesn't have the Holy Ghost no no no we each have personal standards I preached it before and I'll preach it again sometimes what we call a holy ghost standard is just our personal preference sorry our standard is right here if you can point me to this if you want to argue with me if you want to say this is the best way to go the words I want to hear you say is it is written not I think it is written this is where we go to for our absolute in these things amen so the word is the standard and what he's saying here is the holy spirit will not bring one person subject to the word and one person not one person doesn't get to skate by and the other one does no we all act the same way when it comes to the word of God he says it'll make each person come into its character see because it's a spirit that leads you it brings and makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature now catch this he says and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it praise the Lord even when you don't like it you love it you ever heard well actually I kind of think we do it the other way we say that we say man I love that person but I don't like him there are people that we don't get along with so great why personal preferences personalities approaches attit udes I remember there's there's a young man he's he's not so young he's my age now he's a preacher now he's a great preacher When We Were Young I could not get along with him not in this church he's someplace else I couldn't get along with him he just rubbed me the wrong way I never doubted for an exper for a second that he had the holy ghost that he had had a life-changing experience he had had a dramatic life-changing experience and God has called him to be a preacher and he's a phenomenal preacher but I don't get along with him very well but I can get along with him in the in the idea that he is a preacher that he's got a call that he's got a purpose and I'm not called to sit under his ministry and maybe I'm not called to walk alongside him and preach with him but I believe God's with the man and that God's in the manen let's not let our personal preferences of the way things go or the way things should be hold us back and say well they don't have the Holy Ghost no no no that's not what we're talking about amen he says it makes you live and love to do it even in the hard times there's something about knowing when you're a child of God that he's leading you and he's guiding you and when you're on the path that he's LED you on you're okay with it he says oh how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Ghost comes in can we say amen he says how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger for More of it amen he says just bathing yourself what is it's the washing of the water of the word it says he brings realities amen that's the kind of God I serve that's the kind of God I've seen in my life that's the god I want more of in my life is a god of realities amen he says now when God placed man here and in the days of the Lord Jesus he gave man a true road map to his power now I want to take us back to our first scripture as we start to close this morning and this may seem a bit of a mishmash this morning but I just felt to kind of cover this this way to kind of lift our eyes up a little bit this morning so we go to Psalm 1 it says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the seat of the in the way of the Sinners nor walketh in the seat of the scornful if your life matches up with the way the world lives their life something's wrong because theirs is the way of Sinners amen we're a holy people we're a consecrated people we're a sanctified people if we can look and see them doing things we're doing we're wrong it's that simple cuz the word calls us out the word is separating but it says there that sth in the seat of the scornful that word scornful means boastful arrogant mocking in other words he says if you're a man that's a child of God you've come out from this you used to have a different attitude you used to have a different voice you used to have a different influence but you've come out of that and we come into what we've got a new attitude we've got a new Love and it says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night in other words he doesn't consider anything else his reference his guideline is purely by the word of God it's not 12 steps to become a child of God you know or how to influence people and make friends in these different things no it is the word of God that is our place of meditation and our Delight it says is there amen our filter our mindset our inspiration everything is being brought through the word of God and if you do that what's the effect it's verse three it says and he shall shall be like a tree planted placed positionally placed with intention and with intelligence with purpose by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit his fruit in his season his fruit you've got a fruit to produce I've got a fruit to produce you've got a season I've got a season but we've always got the water and it's always there and so that means if the heat comes we still produce fruit the cold comes we still produce fruit because this is flowing water this isn't standing water that would freeze this is flowing water it's always available to us amen it says and his Leaf also shall not wither but I love this last part it says whatsoever he doeth shall prosper We Don't Preach a Prosperity Gospel the way the world does what is the prosperity here what is the son doing what is the daughter doing what is the child of God doing that brings Prosperity meditating on his word and delighting in what they read day and night it is the only thing we take in amen what is prosperity then for us being planted by God it is being in the will of God that is our prosperity amen it's not physical it's not financial prosperity but rather it's the prosperity of knowing that he's with you all times my wife and I we were having a conversation with this brother that that we brought over on on Friday night and she was expressing you know we we came all the way over here to the east coast and we have no blood family here we have family here believe me we have family here but we don't have blood family my father's not here my mother's not here none of my siblings or or anything like that none of her family is here and we're further away than we've ever been and yet she was saying and yet we are So Satisfied here we are so content and things that even might bother other people here don't bother us whether it's the weather which is getting better and better due to climate change Bring It On warmer and warmer right things that would bother anybody else that didn't have a purpose in being here don't bother us why because we've been planted we've been placed and our rest is in his placing not in the situation not in the conditions our rest our satisfying portion is that he said go and that's it that is what the Son and Daughter of God can rest in is when he says I've put you here Church the situation is not our prison the prison is our attitude and mindset towards the situation that's what holds us back so often why our lack of Revelation that he has brought me here he has placed me here I'm walking with him if you are satisfied that you are walking with God today then whatever you're going through you ought to be able to say praise the Lord why because he works all things for my good I'm letting him lead I'm not bringing him subject to my will I'm following his will and therefore whatever is going on is bringing the vision to pass that he spoke about me before the foundation of the world began amen listen to this he says there we go Joseph saw his life as it begin to move he says the next thing you know they found he was thrown into a hole deceived by his brother supposing have been killed and thrown into a hole and was taken up again Joseph foresaw that he saw himself in the prison he saw himself in the dudgeon but catch this he saw God was with him whatever he did know he was a prince of prosperity the world prospered everywhere Joseph was there was prosperity for he was the prince of prosperity and him foreshadowing Christ we wouldn't look at Joseph's situation and say that's Prosperity but it was Prosperity because God was in it God was moving God had ordained Joseph's footsteps and Joseph completely out of control of his life is thrown into a well then taken up sold into slavery goes into Piper's house becomes his Steward increases Piper's wealth tremendously but is still a slave but is prospering in it he knows how to make things work God's training him then is falsely Accu Accused by a a lustful woman and now is completely demoted into prison he's going lower and lower and lower and he's the prince of prosperity why because God is in it and he goes into prison and pretty soon he has the full run of the prison and the prison system is running better than ever and what is it Prosperity follows behind him in whatever place he found himself Joseph prospered seems like he he he makes friends with the Butler and the baker he says when you go before Pharaoh remember me and they forget and he's forgotten and he's just laying in the dungeon laying in the prison but what's he doing whatsoever the hand fth to do do it with all your might do it as unto God and he did it as unto God and God blessed him and then what happened is a need arises and and that man remembers and he tells Pharaoh I know a man that can interpret your dream and in one instant Joseph goes from being a prisoner to second in command and holding the authority of the kingdom and none could go to Pharaoh except through him Prince of prosperity but we don't see it because we're looking at the situation rather than the god who's leading us through the situation he continues he says wherever Christ is there is prosperity not natural we're not talking natural we're talking prosperity in that what the word of God is coming to fulfillment in your life he says when Christ returns to the Earth all the curse of the earth will be taken away some of these days the old desert shall Blossom as a rose the rough places will be made smooth and shall be brought forth in the abundance for he is the prince of prosperity wherever he is he says hallelujah he's the prince of prosperity so our prosperity is found in what coming back to our position in Christ remember Redemption is is to bring back those that have lost their inheritance they squandered they got out of position they got out of place they they left their one true love and he redeems us back and our position in Christ is one of prosperity because scripture says he'll withhold no good thing from us no good thing no Godly thing no thing that comes from him amen so it's Redemption it's a restoration it's healing it's it's overcoming power it's all of these things but it's not a life without struggles Prosperity is not a life without struggles Prosperity is a life that you get the victory no matter what the struggle is amen that you can see the hand of God and all these things Prosperity is to know he's with me whether it's a cloudy day whether it's a rainy day whether it's a sunny day whether we're on the Mountaintop whether in the valley or whether we're just slugging it up the mountain side he is with me and that's all I need to know amen remember we read that quote where brother Brown said Joseph and David and those men didn't even know what they were doing that Christ was revealing himself through them I want to ask you this morning do you realize he's in you and he's revealing himself in your situations we ought to know we ought to be able to realize it because this is the time of understanding there's nothing held back from us the mystery is being revealed we ought to be able to say it's Christ in me being revealed in these life situations no matter how big it is no matter how bad it is amen are we blind to our portrayal of Christ or are we saying I see it I see it I didn't used to be able to do that but now I do it my old reaction was this but my new reaction was this praise God that I've got peace in the storm storm St haven't changed but the person in the storm has changed why because there's a man in the boat that can calm me even when the storm continues to rage first thing Jesus did was calm them and then he calmed the storm listen to this as we start to close Paul said let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he ha said this is what we have church I will never leave thee nor forsake thee you got a lot of money praise the Lord he's with you you got a little bit of money praise the Lord he's with you you got all the health you got Health struggles he's with me no matter where you're at he says I will never leave you nor forsake you he says so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper not your helper my helper personal you got to put your name there he said says and I will not fear what man shall do unto me prophet of God would say what we need today is a coming together and a prayer meeting and to stay there until God sends the adoption of the Holy Spirit and brings the Holy Ghost down and places in the church Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's what we need he's talking about anointed Ministry he says that's what the church needs he says it won't compromise it'll stay with the word a church that won't flirt with the world you say brother John I'm not out in the world yeah but are you flirting with the world Amen Satan likes to flirt that's how he got Eve he says a church that will have nothing to do with sin he says that'll turn its back on sin you know what that is church that's repentance to turn your back on sin is repentance he says that I'll walk in the Holiness and beauty of God living for God and then he says live or die what difference does it make as long as I'm for God what difference does it make he says you know when you get the Holy Ghost you attend a lot of obstacles got some obstacles this morning got some walls got some thick doors no way to go through he says many are the afflictions of the righteous but God deliver him out of them all he says God brings you right up facing with it so he can show you what his power and his goodness amen let's stand together if the musicians would come we all how many would say I want the goodness and power of God this morning get ready for some obstacles because he's proving himself through us he's proving he's a Healer he's proving he's a deliverer he's proving he's a provider you know little testimony this morning Jonathan had been really struggling with his throat and it closed till almost it was like the size of a peanut his throat could barely drink or swallow or anything like that and so we tried to get into a doctor of course we don't have a family doctor I'm telling talking about knocking down obstacles okay we don't have a family doctor and we went in to the walk-in clinic on Mundy pond at like 10:45 in the morning okay you go into money Pond late it's full they've already booked everything we walk in and I walk up and I said my son needs to see a doctor about his throat she said we just had a cancellation I'll put you in 2 minutes later another lady walks in and she walks up she says I need an appointment you know what the lady said we are completely booked and our wait list is full we walked in at the exact moment needed to see a doctor we were in and out in less than 20 minutes sometimes God heals and sometimes God says listen I can open any door see so often we want the supernatural God but God says I open all doors it all belongs to me who is greater than our God and something is simple and I told Jonathan I said that's the God we serve he can heal his throat like this or he can get us into a doctor to give him medication to heal it it's the same God he cares about the little things he cares about the path he cares about the purpose every single bit of it it's the hand of God moving in the Sons and Daughters of God his fing is in our lives Church those little things if we could recognize that as much as the hand of God as the great big things that we see in our life it would encourage us on our day-to-day walk that we can literally as children of God walk through and we see this door and he just goes and it just opens before us and we don't even know there was a door there sister Morin we don't even know there was a door there we walked in and we got what we needed he's a God a provision he's Jehovah Gyra literally they didn't give that to the to the people on the waiting list they gave it to the sons of God that walked in praise His name amen that's the God we serve amen we're a prosperous people because we are walking with him that's what gives us our confidence amen he leads we follow and that gives us the greatest confidence we ought to have he says he will do for you the same if you'll stand after you receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian and act like a Christian should he says if you'll put your face in God's word medita in it day and night church if you'll put your face in God's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your pant legs be bagged at the knees brothers from what how do you get your knees bagged you stretch them out get on your knees start praying start praying in faith and say I'll not leave until you touch me I'm trusting your word I'm believing your word he says let your pant legs be begged at the knees be reverent before God there'll be someday that God will take you over to a side one and give to you a power and a gift that the whole world will know he's been with you he says that's placing a son to his position Hallelujah I'm here to tell you if he's given you the Holy Ghost this morning you're candidate for adoption and we're going to get into this Lord willing in the next service or two what are those positions and you're going to see it's not just ministers it's not just men it's not just adults but it is women it is children it is men it is Young it is old it is Rich it is poor it is healthy it is infirm every single one of them has a position and a place where the authority of all of Heaven is behind them that's what you guys have
