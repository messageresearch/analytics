[30:47] heaven oh yeah he he apparently believed
[30:50] in heaven he's a politician for many
[30:53] many years provincially and federally
[30:55] and he did ask him he said when you get
[30:57] to heaven he said are you going to tell
[30:58] the new flanders from all the rest
[31:01] they didn't know the answer
[31:03] well he said it's a very simple answer
[31:05] he said they're the only ones that want

[31:57] they came here amen and we thank the
[32:00] lord that he used us
[32:02] and
[32:03] he laid that burden on our brother mark
[32:05] here some years ago in 1995 to put a a
[32:09] site on online regarding the message
[32:13] because at the time i believe our
[32:14] brother did a research
[32:16] on the internet he did a search for
[32:18] william branham
[32:19] well
[32:20] there's no william branham he just came
[32:22] up with one branham and i think he was a
[32:24] he was a sports figure
[32:26] somewhere in the united states that was
[32:28] the only reference to branham's
[32:31] so he said they said brother gerald he
[32:33] said would you like to put the message
[32:34] online
[32:35] so we we checked it out and we put it
[32:37] online amen of course if that maybe
[32:41] could be 3 million hits right now for
[32:44] sure when it comes to the william
[32:46] branham home page amen and it's known
[32:49] around the world
[32:50] and by the grace of god that we have
[32:52] ministered to 62 countries amen
[32:56] and it's absolutely tremendous and and
[32:58] as i said well
[33:00] to go to god be the glory there was a
[33:02] time when our the lord laid it on
[33:04] brother mark's heart here to print
[33:07] to certain messages in uh
[33:09] in the language
[33:10] in
[33:12] swahili
[33:13] you know in this there were three
[33:14] different messages and he and he felt uh
[33:18] led of the lord to to print them in
[33:19] swahili and so we printed 10 000 each of
[33:24] those three messages there was 30 000
[33:27] and we sent to africa
[33:29] and we just left it with the lord amen
[33:32] and then when i was in tucson some years

[46:45] may the lord have his blessings
[46:48] and you may have your seat
[46:55] i want to read
[46:58] before we start there
[47:03] uh
[47:04] what brother gerald shared with us this
[47:06] morning with
[47:08] regards to the church here and
[47:12] and
[47:14] to what
[47:15] what has happened down over the years
[47:17] and how you've ministered to so many
[47:20] countries and
[47:22] so many people and
[47:24] in so many nations and
[47:27] you know
[47:28] i think that's uh
[47:31] that's a great accomplishment
[47:38] and we should thank god that we have
[47:40] that
[47:42] honor
[47:44] that he's placed on us steve
[47:47] placed them for the journal and sister
[47:49] betty
[47:50] and brother the coffee brothers here and
[47:53] other
[47:53] brothers that
[47:55] have
[47:56] you know
[47:57] praise the lord
[47:59] but they're back to the plow or
[48:02] to
[48:03] to
[48:05] do that and have that
[48:07] undying love of the word
[48:10] because that's what it is it's the
[48:12] undying love of the word
[48:14] to get the word out
[48:16] you know what i mean
[48:18] and uh
[48:22] this is i'll just read this from for to
[48:25] you
[48:26] from the message i know my redeemer
[48:28] liveth
[48:29] i know my redeemer lived
[48:34] and he says i was studying last evening
[48:37] during the storm and was thinking
[48:40] what would be appropriate words to say
[48:42] in the morning at this resurrection
[48:45] service
[48:46] and my
[48:47] thoughts fell upon this subject that our
[48:49] brother has just read
[48:51] of job the 19th chapter
[48:54] and the 23rd to the 27 verses i know my
[48:58] redeemer liveth said job
[49:00] and i chose that for the subject
[49:03] and as we come
[49:06] why are we coming
[49:08] is for this purpose only
[49:11] that we could find new hopes
[49:14] right
[49:15] we are on this earth here and we know
[49:17] we're living in darkness
[49:20] we just don't have to kind of imagine
[49:22] these things or kill ourselves as it was
[49:25] because we know that we're living in the
[49:28] shadows of death each time we hear an
[49:31] ambulance scream
[49:33] when we pass the cemetery when we see a
[49:35] hospital every gray here
[49:39] marks it on our memorials that we are
[49:42] doomed people to both young and old amen
[49:46] right
[49:48] and we come on such a morning to gather
[49:51] hopes
[49:52] some new hopes of what we are here for
[49:56] and what is the purpose and i think that
[49:59] is a wonderful time to think of the
[50:02] hopes that god has given us
[50:04] amen right
[50:06] now we want to draw this first into our
[50:09] mind
[50:11] that there is not one thing
[50:13] and this is important what brother
[50:15] branham is saying here
[50:17] there is not one thing
[50:18] that can destroy us
[50:21] destroy us
[50:22] until the purpose of he who created us
[50:25] has been fulfilled
[50:28] right
[50:29] and i know everybody has heard this
[50:32] before and time and time again
[50:35] but it's good for us to have that on the
[50:37] forefront
[50:38] on the tablets of our mind
[50:40] you know
[50:41] nothing
[50:42] can go wrong
[50:44] with you or i
[50:45] we can get sick
[50:47] we can have all these things going on
[50:50] but nothing is going to take us out of
[50:52] here until the purpose of god in our
[50:55] lives each individual life here brothers
[50:58] and sisters has been fulfilled
[51:01] and you can take that to the bank
[51:03] amen
[51:05] so uh
[51:08] there could be nothing we are made for a
[51:10] purpose
[51:12] this church was built for a purpose
[51:15] and we can say this church was built for
[51:17] a purpose maybe it wasn't brother gerald
[51:19] that built a church i don't know who
[51:21] built the church at the beginning but
[51:23] the church is here
[51:25] and
[51:26] it's producing
[51:28] souls to the kingdom of god
[51:32] amen
[51:34] the message of the hour the light of the
[51:36] hour
[51:37] jesus says if you walk in the light as i
[51:40] am in the light you have fellowship one
[51:42] with another and the blood of jesus
[51:44] christ cleanses us from all sin
[51:46] in god there's no darkness
[51:50] amen in god there's no sin in god
[51:53] there's only light
[51:55] amen
[51:56] you know
[51:57] and then we sang that little chorus at
[51:58] the end there we'll walk in the light
[52:01] that is the only light brothers and
[52:02] sisters in this age that there is to
[52:06] walk in
[52:08] that is the light of the age
[52:11] see it's not westerly age it's not
[52:13] pentecostal age it's not luther age it's
[52:16] not any other age
[52:17] right but we're at the top of the age
[52:22] amen right
[52:26] walk in the light as he is in the light
[52:30] right
[52:31] it behooves us
[52:33] amen
[52:36] he says this foundation was not dug and
[52:38] the cornerstone wasn't
[52:41] laid and the blood apart me and the
[52:43] blocks laid into the building and the
[52:45] roof ending
[52:46] in the interior was put here
[52:49] not just to see if it could be done it
[52:51] was put here for a purpose
[52:54] or for a purpose he says
[52:56] your home that you live in was not just
[52:58] accidentally put there or somebody just
[53:01] wasting some time your home was made for
[53:04] a purpose to serve a purpose
[53:06] to raise up your family amen
[53:08] to have that fellowship together
[53:11] to eat together to walk together to live
[53:13] together to pray together
[53:17] he says if you did drive this morning in
[53:19] your automobile that automobile was made
[53:22] was not made just to see if it could be
[53:25] made the materials was not
[53:27] wasted by man it was put here for a
[53:30] purpose and to serve a purpose which we
[53:32] all enjoyed that purpose this morning
[53:34] didn't we
[53:35] hey we didn't have to hook up our horse
[53:37] and buggy
[53:39] amen
[53:40] brothers didn't have to go out and feed
[53:42] the horse and tackle it up and
[53:45] and you hear the bells coming down the
[53:46] road
[53:48] amen but we have these nice automobiles
[53:50] praise god
[53:52] i thank the lord
[53:53] i thank the lord when i go to the gas
[53:55] pumps that i have a dollar in my pocket
[53:57] that i have that i can put some fuel in
[54:00] it and i can go from a to b
[54:02] amen
[54:03] that's what we thank god for these
[54:05] things
[54:06] all these things how he takes care of us
[54:13] he says the clothing that you wear was
[54:15] not just to see if somebody could
[54:17] fashion something it was for a purpose
[54:20] the food that you eat was not grown on
[54:22] the earth just to see it grow
[54:24] it was made to serve a purpose
[54:27] and god did that did not just make a
[54:30] tree to be a tree he made a tree for a
[54:33] purpose
[54:34] amen
[54:37] nice pulpit is made
[54:39] from a tree
[54:42] and god did not make you and i just to
[54:45] see if he could
[54:47] do it he made us for a purpose amen
[54:51] amen
[54:52] amen
[54:54] hey we didn't know what the purpose of
[54:56] god was always in our lives
[54:59] we may have had had a desire to serve
[55:02] god and wait but we didn't have to wear
[55:04] with all to serve god
[55:08] because we didn't have a revelation of
[55:11] how we should serve god amen and what
[55:13] god requires of us
[55:20] therefore
[55:21] he says there is a purpose
[55:23] of us all being here
[55:26] you're not here to just be another human
[55:28] being
[55:30] see there's many many human beings on
[55:32] the earth the earth's been populated and
[55:35] overpopulated and and so on he says you
[55:38] are here because that god made you for
[55:40] some purpose
[55:42] you're not here just to eat the food
[55:44] that god growed you're not here just to
[55:47] live in the house that god made
[55:49] or that man made pardon me or to wear
[55:52] the clothing that someone fashioned
[55:54] you are here for a specific purpose
[55:58] and little ones big ones
[56:00] unimportant ones and important ones
[56:04] he says
[56:05] no matter how little you are how big you
[56:08] are how important you are
[56:10] or how unimportant you are you are here
[56:13] to serve a purpose
[56:17] the bible says
[56:19] that which every joint supply
[56:23] amen right
[56:25] amen
[56:27] sisters
[56:28] slaving the kitchen day after day
[56:32] week after week month after month
[56:34] washing clothes ironing clothes doing
[56:36] this doing that all those things
[56:39] right
[56:40] fulfilling the purpose of god that
[56:43] purpose is just as important as any
[56:46] other
[56:47] purpose
[56:48] in god's economy
[56:50] amen and just as necessary
[56:54] amen
[56:56] hallelujah amen brother branham says
[56:58] motherhood
[57:00] can be considered to be the fifth gospel
[57:03] hallelujah amen
[57:06] we don't have mothers these days
[57:09] you know the world has sort of gone a
[57:11] little wonky on that day
[57:18] okay i'll just be finished here in a
[57:20] second
[57:21] then i can
[57:22] quit
[57:24] eh and uh
[57:30] okay where was i
[57:33] how big you are
[57:35] he says
[57:36] just as my finger
[57:38] is here for a purpose
[57:43] then there is nothing can destroy us
[57:46] until god's purpose is fulfilled
[57:49] nothing can harm us
[57:51] until that purpose
[57:54] that god has put us here for
[57:57] amen has been made manifest that's right
[58:00] amen
[58:05] no matter how much
[58:07] trouble we have how much heartache or
[58:10] sorrows that we go through
[58:13] all of these are reasons
[58:15] and there's a reason for it
[58:19] amen
[58:20] he says we we
[58:22] we
[58:23] we will take for instance noah in his
[58:26] bible in the bible
[58:27] there was a flood that came by and all
[58:30] the earth was destroyed
[58:32] the vegetation everything was destroyed
[58:36] but noah
[58:37] and the seed that he had
[58:39] take was taken into new york
[58:43] god's purpose
[58:44] can never be defeated
[58:47] right god's purpose can never be
[58:49] defeated there is nothing can defeated
[58:55] can somebody say amen
[59:02] and so how happy ought we be
[59:05] we to be today
[59:07] wrestling on that beautiful
[59:10] revelation
[59:11] of the word of the living god
[59:13] amen amen
[59:15] that there is nothing
[59:17] neither thing's present and he's reading
[59:19] from the book of romans here
[59:21] nor things that can come
[59:23] there's no sickness
[59:25] there's no sorrow
[59:27] no death
[59:28] no plurals
[59:30] no nothing can separate us from the
[59:32] purpose of the living god amen
[59:35] the purpose of the living god i just
[59:37] heard brother
[59:40] girl speaking about the sister
[59:42] from new brunswick
[59:45] and
[59:46] she lives in new brunswick she's coming
[59:48] to school here
[59:50] but there's a purpose for that
[59:53] amen

[1:02:51] what he should do and what he shouldn't
[1:02:52] do

[1:02:58] resist the temptations and everything
[1:03:00] else that came

[1:04:23] the attributes of god
[1:04:25] what god

[1:07:25] under the heavens amen
[1:07:46] a reading from the message
[1:07:49] that was spoken in 1965 november
[1:07:53] 27 there are boats i think
[1:07:56] i have heard but now i see
[1:07:59] amen right
[1:08:01] right i have heard
[1:08:03] but now i see brother branham used
[1:08:06] the book of job
[1:08:08] and he used job as a
[1:08:11] for his text here
[1:08:14] and he says i have heard of thee
[1:08:18] by the hearing of the year
[1:08:21] and now might i have seen thee
[1:08:26] wherefore i abhor myself and repent in
[1:08:29] dust and ashes
[1:08:31] he says i want to take a text from that
[1:08:33] fifth verse
[1:08:35] i have heard of thee by the hearing of
[1:08:37] the ear
[1:08:38] but now my eye
[1:08:40] see at thee
[1:08:43] now i wrote down some stuff here
[1:08:49] that i'd like just to
[1:08:52] read some more
[1:08:55] i told by the journal
[1:08:57] uh
[1:08:59] this morning that
[1:09:01] i'm i'm a spare tire
[1:09:05] i preacher
[1:09:06] i'm not a flat tire
[1:09:09] i'm not totally
[1:09:12] you know
[1:09:14] useless
[1:09:17] but
[1:09:18] uh
[1:09:20] i don't minister very often
[1:09:22] so
[1:09:23] bear with me
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:25] brother branham used jobs
[1:09:28] used job
[1:09:30] he said let's take a little of his life
[1:09:34] take a little of his life
[1:09:36] job was a prophet he was a man that
[1:09:38] lived back before the bible
[1:09:41] was written
[1:09:42] he says it's been thought that job was
[1:09:44] one of the oldest books of the bible
[1:09:48] because it was written before genesis
[1:09:50] was written
[1:09:51] job this great warrior and prophet was a
[1:09:54] mighty man in his day
[1:09:58] no doubt that he had been brought up and
[1:10:00] had served the lord all of his life
[1:10:03] and had lived such a gallant life to the
[1:10:06] people
[1:10:07] all had respects to him
[1:10:10] right
[1:10:11] but he come to a place to where he calls
[1:10:14] it here
[1:10:15] being tempted
[1:10:16] off the lord brother branham says but
[1:10:18] i'd like to use the word being tested by
[1:10:21] the lord amen
[1:10:22] right
[1:10:23] and he uses scripture from over in
[1:10:25] hebrews he says every son that come to
[1:10:27] god must first be
[1:10:29] tested and tried and child trained amen
[1:10:32] that's right and then if the testing
[1:10:34] gets hard and we think it's too hard and
[1:10:36] won't listen take heed that he says we
[1:10:39] become an illegitimate
[1:10:42] child excuse me
[1:10:45] and not a child of god
[1:10:47] now he says because there's nothing
[1:10:50] can move a real born-again
[1:10:53] child of god away from his parents amen
[1:10:58] see he's part of him you could no more
[1:11:01] deny it than you could deny yourself
[1:11:05] see you've had the experience
[1:11:10] so you've been trained and tested
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:18] now this is job we're talking about here
[1:11:21] but we've had a profit in our day
[1:11:24] we'd come in our day son of a moonshiner
[1:11:29] he had to go through the same thing that
[1:11:31] job went through amen
[1:11:34] and the bible tells us in hebrew every
[1:11:36] son that cometh to god
[1:11:39] must be tried and tested
[1:11:41] and proved
[1:11:44] and proved
[1:11:45] then the adoption takes place
[1:11:51] and now
[1:11:53] this man being a prophet
[1:11:55] he had access to god's grace
[1:11:59] yes
[1:12:00] access to god's grace
[1:12:04] that's the bank account
[1:12:07] right that's god's bank account
[1:12:12] you just put your signature right there
[1:12:14] along with his
[1:12:16] say lord
[1:12:18] that's for me
[1:12:20] right
[1:12:23] this walks for me
[1:12:26] this gospel is for me amen that's right
[1:12:30] but job didn't have a bible to read
[1:12:33] the bible wasn't wrote then but he had
[1:12:35] access to god by revelation and by
[1:12:38] vision
[1:12:39] by revelation and by vision
[1:12:42] that was before the bible was written
[1:12:45] and we find out and take some of his
[1:12:48] life when god blessed him and made him a
[1:12:50] great man
[1:12:53] why even everybody respected him
[1:12:56] even to his wisdom
[1:12:58] had become so great his inspiration from
[1:13:01] god had vindicated him to be god's
[1:13:04] servant so plainly until the people come
[1:13:07] from everywhere to hear him
[1:13:09] and then satan began to accuse that man
[1:13:13] amen
[1:13:15] satan began to take notice of job
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:25] and that's the way he does every
[1:13:27] inspired servant of god
[1:13:30] satan is always there to accuse him of
[1:13:33] everything
[1:13:34] that he does that's not right
[1:13:37] and now we find out his life and trials
[1:13:40] and his great faith
[1:13:43] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:13:45] for
[1:13:46] the evidence of things not seen amen for
[1:13:49] by it
[1:13:50] the bible tells us the elders obtain a
[1:13:53] good report
[1:13:54] hey elder
[1:13:56] amen elder
[1:13:59] don't have to be this color here to be
[1:14:01] an elder amen
[1:14:03] you just have to be full of the holy
[1:14:05] ghost in power amen
[1:14:08] bald
[1:14:12] timothy even jesus when he came on the
[1:14:15] earth he referred to the patience of job
[1:14:20] he said have you not read of the
[1:14:22] patience of job
[1:14:24] referred to in james 5 11.
[1:14:27] see
[1:14:28] faith
[1:14:30] brother branham says here in this
[1:14:32] message
[1:14:33] faith waits with patience amen
[1:14:38] for the promised word to be fulfilled
[1:14:42] amen
[1:14:43] remember that faith
[1:14:46] waits with patience
[1:14:48] for the promised word
[1:14:50] to be fulfilled amen amen yes that's
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:55] praise the lord
[1:14:58] all down true scriptures brothers and
[1:15:00] sisters
[1:15:02] old testament
[1:15:03] on to the new testament to where we are
[1:15:05] right today
[1:15:07] faith
[1:15:10] faith waits with patience
[1:15:13] for the promised word to be fulfilled
[1:15:17] and that's
[1:15:18] that statement can go individually
[1:15:22] into our lives to become that part in
[1:15:25] our lives
[1:15:27] when we never forget
[1:15:30] that those two go together
[1:15:32] faith and patience go together
[1:15:36] right amen
[1:15:37] patience in an age of instant everything
[1:15:40] this is my words i wrote down here
[1:15:43] by how impatient
[1:15:45] we become
[1:15:47] how impatient we become
[1:15:50] and we can we can judge that ourselves
[1:15:54] i don't need to
[1:15:55] to preach how how
[1:15:59] or ask you how impatient you are
[1:16:02] i know what impatience is all about
[1:16:06] i talk to my wife about it sometimes
[1:16:08] you know i say honey
[1:16:13] don't be impatient
[1:16:15] or she says dad don't be impatient
[1:16:19] just wait and see what
[1:16:21] what's going to go on
[1:16:23] you know just wait
[1:16:36] can anybody tell me how many months job
[1:16:38] was on the ash sheep
[1:16:41] i think it was a lot of months
[1:16:45] i think it was a lot of months
[1:16:51] it got so bad
[1:16:52] he was boiled from head to toe
[1:17:01] he had lost everything
[1:17:04] all his
[1:17:05] stuff
[1:17:06] that god had built up there for him
[1:17:08] it was all gone
[1:17:10] his kids was gone the servants were gone
[1:17:12] the farms were gone the cattle was gone
[1:17:15] the donkeys and whatever else
[1:17:17] he had there all gone
[1:17:23] and you know what job said
[1:17:26] anybody know what job said
[1:17:29] the lord give it
[1:17:31] and the lord take it away amen
[1:17:36] see
[1:17:37] in all this
[1:17:38] the bible says in all this
[1:17:40] job did not sin
[1:17:42] all this can you imagine
[1:17:45] and you go through that message there i
[1:17:47] have
[1:17:48] i have heard but now i see you go
[1:17:50] through that message and study it a
[1:17:51] little bit there
[1:17:53] you know and you find out
[1:17:55] that
[1:17:56] job went through all this
[1:17:58] trial
[1:18:01] because satan
[1:18:03] had gone before god
[1:18:05] right
[1:18:09] satan was studying job
[1:18:12] right and he he's got this
[1:18:16] brain wave
[1:18:20] you know i'm going to go before god and
[1:18:22] i'm going to tell him
[1:18:23] god i can make job cursed you
[1:18:30] this was satan
[1:18:33] so
[1:18:35] i think maybe god had a sense of humor
[1:18:37] at the time
[1:18:39] about that
[1:18:40] and uh
[1:18:43] god didn't tell job the conversation was
[1:18:46] between god and satan
[1:18:48] it wasn't god job and satan
[1:18:50] so job didn't know what was going on
[1:18:55] which proved his righteousness
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:00] he didn't know
[1:19:02] that he was being tested that way
[1:19:07] he had no idea he's been tested that way
[1:19:11] all job knew was that he had faith
[1:19:16] and he had patience
[1:19:20] and he sat on the ash heap for that so
[1:19:22] many months
[1:19:26] right
[1:19:28] and every friend he had turned against
[1:19:31] them
[1:19:32] every colleague he had turned against
[1:19:34] him
[1:19:35] every one of the business people that he
[1:19:37] dealt with on a daily basis down
[1:19:40] at the gate there whatever
[1:19:42] they all turned against him
[1:19:45] and finally
[1:19:46] the most precious thing that god could
[1:19:48] give a man
[1:19:52] his wife
[1:19:53] turned against him
[1:19:55] joel why don't you curse god and die
[1:19:58] let it be over job
[1:20:01] let it be done
[1:20:04] he says you speak as the foolish woman
[1:20:07] as a foolish woman
[1:20:09] shall not we receive
[1:20:12] from god
[1:20:21] but satan thought he could twist him
[1:20:23] around a little bit
[1:20:25] oh
[1:20:26] he'd like to twist this word
[1:20:28] he'd like to twist his word
[1:20:30] hey
[1:20:32] he'd like to twist this
[1:20:33] amen
[1:20:36] but you know what there's no twisting
[1:20:38] this
[1:20:39] this this this is a purpose
[1:20:41] that's right
[1:20:44] amen you are the purpose

[1:20:55] when the sons of god
[1:20:57] dance for joy
[1:21:00] right
[1:21:02] we were part of god
[1:21:04] this message came in the end time
[1:21:07] to reveal god to us
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:13] not just in word form brothers and
[1:21:15] sisters not just in word form the gospel
[1:21:18] came not in old times
[1:21:20] but it was revealed by man but it came
[1:21:22] in the power and demonstration
[1:21:24] of the holy spirit amen that is the
[1:21:27] gospel that's right absolutely
[1:21:30] not emotions i'm not talking about
[1:21:31] emotions or anything like that i don't
[1:21:33] mind emotions i like emotions i'm a
[1:21:35] little emotional sometimes

[1:21:50] wall but

[1:21:56] really good feeling

[1:22:03] and when that happens brothers and
[1:22:04] sisters you let go and let god have his

[1:22:22] checkbook

[1:26:28] how god loved him but you see job is
[1:26:31] perfect revelation of god

[1:26:36] perfect
[1:26:37] revelation of god
[1:26:39] amen
[1:26:40] who god is
[1:26:42] most people don't know if he's father if

[1:26:47] if he's all three
[1:26:49] if he's two if he's one
[1:26:51] you know that's the way the world today

[1:27:21] i mean we all have we all have christian
[1:27:23] friends out there in the denomination
[1:27:25] and so on
[1:27:29] he waited for his faith to be confirmed
[1:27:33] because he had a grip on god
[1:27:35] a revelation amen now brother branham
[1:27:38] says this
[1:27:40] now when the sick people that's in the
[1:27:42] building
[1:27:43] the crippled people
[1:27:45] or you that have in need of god
[1:27:48] when you can get that type of revelation
[1:27:50] that you are justified
[1:27:52] justified means you didn't do it
[1:27:55] that's my interpretation that's the one
[1:27:57] i've been
[1:27:58] we didn't do it
[1:28:00] when you are actually justified in
[1:28:02] asking the thing that you're asking for
[1:28:05] and believe that
[1:28:07] he is a rewarder of those that
[1:28:09] diligently seek him
[1:28:11] you believe that he is a rewarder
[1:28:14] of those that diligently diligently seek
[1:28:18] him
[1:28:18] there's nothing can separate you from

[1:28:55] there is nothing wrong
[1:28:58] there is nothing wrong with the message
[1:29:02] not one iota
[1:29:06] not one iota

[1:29:52] to them that have obtained
[1:29:54] like precious faith
[1:29:56] that's what this is really
[1:29:58] because

[1:31:00] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:31:03] through the knowledge of god and of
[1:31:05] jesus our lord
[1:31:07] according as his divine power had given
[1:31:10] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:31:13] life
[1:31:14] and godliness

[1:38:06] i gotta think where it is
[1:38:16] here it is right here
[1:38:18] i've heard but now i see
[1:38:22] satan came before god
[1:38:24] because he could
[1:38:26] come before god and accuse the
[1:38:28] christians or the believers
[1:38:31] all the time
[1:38:33] so he accused job of many things
[1:38:37] and said
[1:38:38] that job the reason he could serve god
[1:38:43] because everything was coming good to
[1:38:45] him for him
[1:38:46] but said if you'll just let me have him
[1:38:49] in my hands
[1:38:51] i'll make him curse you to your face
[1:38:55] see
[1:38:56] he says i want you to notice i want you
[1:38:58] to notice the confidence confidence
[1:39:04] that god
[1:39:06] had in a believer
[1:39:12] all right
[1:39:14] i want you to notice the confidence that
[1:39:16] god had in the believer amen in other
[1:39:18] words god said to job
[1:39:21] upon me or said to satan like this
[1:39:24] you can't do it
[1:39:27] you can't do it
[1:39:29] he's a just man
[1:39:33] there's not one like him in the whole
[1:39:35] earth
[1:39:38] right
[1:39:39] there's no one like him in the whole
[1:39:40] earth oh what a man
[1:39:43] god was saying this right oh what a man
[1:39:46] that god himself
[1:39:48] would say to his enemy
[1:39:51] my servant is so perfect does not
[1:39:53] another man on earth like him
[1:39:58] see
[1:39:59] oh he says if we could only be that kind
[1:40:02] of a man
[1:40:03] that god could bestow that confidence
[1:40:06] upon
[1:40:06] us that know that we
[1:40:09] that we will not twist from his word or
[1:40:12] his being anyway
[1:40:15] stay exactly
[1:40:18] say what the word says
[1:40:20] right say what the word says don't worry
[1:40:22] about what anybody else is saying
[1:40:26] don't even bother with it
[1:40:28] don't even click onto it
[1:40:30] forget it right
[1:40:33] they're not saying what this word says
[1:40:35] they're not worthy of your attention
[1:40:36] amen
[1:40:45] the god could bestow that confidence in
[1:40:48] him
[1:40:48] that'll know that that know that
[1:40:51] will not twist from his word or his
[1:40:54] being anyway
[1:40:56] stay exactly and he can put his trust in
[1:40:58] us
[1:41:00] now job was a man that carried out god's
[1:41:02] commandment to the letter exactly and
[1:41:05] satan knew that but he said if you'll
[1:41:07] just let me have him
[1:41:09] even though he knew it
[1:41:13] but he he wanted to carry on anyways
[1:41:16] he won
[1:41:18] i'll make him curse you to your face
[1:41:21] so god told him he says now he's in your
[1:41:24] hands but don't take his life
[1:41:27] and satan even stretched as far as he
[1:41:29] could on that
[1:41:31] he took every friend and everything he
[1:41:33] had almost his complete life but he
[1:41:35] couldn't take his life
[1:41:37] but job still held right on there there
[1:41:40] was no turning back
[1:41:43] no turning back
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:49] take the whole world
[1:41:52] but give me jesus amen amen jesus
[1:41:57] john in the beginning
[1:41:59] was the word
[1:42:00] and the word was with god and the word
[1:42:03] was god and the word was made flesh
[1:42:07] the word was made flesh became a person
[1:42:10] amen
[1:42:11] thank you
[1:42:12] jesus the monsters
[1:42:16] hallelujah
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:21] praise the lord
[1:42:30] you see when a man
[1:42:32] or a person has once really come in
[1:42:34] contact with god
[1:42:36] we made the contact
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:39] have you made the contact with god
[1:42:43] once a man has made the contact with god
[1:42:47] or a woman or a boy or a girl or anyone
[1:42:53] with that genuine reveal faith that god
[1:42:57] is god is
[1:42:59] right
[1:43:00] there's nothing
[1:43:02] no time nowhere can ever separate
[1:43:06] that man from his god
[1:43:10] on the ash heap
[1:43:12] whatever it is
[1:43:13] doesn't matter what it is
[1:43:15] sickness sorrow whatever it may be
[1:43:19] nothing can separate that man
[1:43:21] from his god amen right i said he said i
[1:43:25] believe it was paul says there's no
[1:43:27] strife and no hunger no pearls neither
[1:43:29] living creatures and so on he says you
[1:43:32] are securely anchored in him
[1:43:34] because
[1:43:36] because
[1:43:37] you were ordained
[1:43:39] to that life
[1:43:42] you're ordained to that life brother why
[1:43:45] why am i standing here
[1:43:47] because god ordained me to this life
[1:43:52] ordain me
[1:43:53] a heathen catholic
[1:43:57] right
[1:44:02] god
[1:44:03] before the foundation of the world
[1:44:09] but satan
[1:44:11] thought he could twist him around a
[1:44:13] little bit and cuff him up and make him
[1:44:15] do it but you see job with his perfect
[1:44:17] revelation of god and who god was and
[1:44:20] how god loved him
[1:44:22] see he waited no matter what the
[1:44:25] circumstances was
[1:44:27] circumstances was
[1:44:29] the boils
[1:44:31] the family
[1:44:32] the farm the animals
[1:44:34] all that he had
[1:44:37] all the wisdom that he would share
[1:44:39] back in the day
[1:44:40] with all the people that came to him
[1:44:42] asking for advice everything it was all
[1:44:45] gone all he had was his ash sheep
[1:44:49] that he was sitting on
[1:44:51] and he had his faith
[1:44:54] see
[1:44:56] he waited for his faith to be confirmed
[1:45:02] he waited for his faith to be confirmed
[1:45:06] because he had a grip on god in
[1:45:07] revelation
[1:45:09] he says that i spoke off last night
[1:45:11] he says now when the sick people that's
[1:45:13] in the building the crippled people or
[1:45:15] you have that have a need of god when
[1:45:17] you get that type of revelation that you
[1:45:19] are justified
[1:45:22] that you are justified when you are
[1:45:24] actually justified in asking the thing
[1:45:26] that you are asking for and believe that
[1:45:29] he is a rewarder of those that
[1:45:30] diligently seek after him does nothing
[1:45:34] can ever separate you from that faith
[1:45:36] that's anchored in you
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:42] it's not something that you put on
[1:45:46] that
[1:45:47] that's there
[1:45:50] that's given to you by god
[1:45:58] there's nothing can ever separate you
[1:46:00] from that faith that's anchored in you
[1:46:02] see
[1:46:03] but first it has to be revealed to you
[1:46:07] it has to be revealed to
[1:46:09] you amen
[1:46:15] if you if you read along in this book
[1:46:16] he's talking about demas and those guys
[1:46:20] and god had showed brother venom branham
[1:46:22] a vision where the oil was in down in
[1:46:24] kentucky there someplace
[1:46:26] right yeah
[1:46:28] but i mean they could have had all that
[1:46:30] oil but they wouldn't listen to him yes
[1:46:32] that's right
[1:46:34] it wasn't god
[1:46:36] it ended up if you read through this
[1:46:38] here you'll find out it was all for the
[1:46:40] wrong
[1:46:40] wrong reason
[1:46:43] all for the wrong reason
[1:46:45] you know they got in squabbles and
[1:46:46] everything over and so on amen right
[1:46:54] i'm just about clued up here
[1:46:59] at the end of that oil
[1:47:01] thing
[1:47:03] you know brother branham says
[1:47:09] they were having lunches as the holy
[1:47:11] spirit showed me a great crack in the
[1:47:13] earth
[1:47:14] and in that was full of oil
[1:47:18] and these overflows in kentucky was just
[1:47:21] little beds of oil that we're pumping
[1:47:23] from
[1:47:24] but this one comes from the mainstream
[1:47:27] and i said brother demas it's there
[1:47:31] so they went to searching for it says go
[1:47:33] down and tell us where
[1:47:35] where the oil well is to ask billy
[1:47:37] branham he says oh no no no see we don't
[1:47:40] use the gift of god for commercial
[1:47:43] no no
[1:47:44] see he could he could tell me where it
[1:47:47] was at but i don't have any need of it i
[1:47:49] wouldn't i wouldn't even have faith
[1:47:51] enough to ask him
[1:47:54] see so you judge faith right
[1:47:58] if you have faith
[1:48:00] brother branham had faith
[1:48:02] we have faith
[1:48:05] but here's a
[1:48:07] prophet of god
[1:48:09] and they said they're saying go down and
[1:48:11] tell us where it's at and he says i
[1:48:12] wouldn't i wouldn't have faith do you
[1:48:15] and even if i did he said i wouldn't
[1:48:16] have faith to ask him
[1:48:18] he had no need of that
[1:48:23] and why what what motive what objective
[1:48:29] reign
[1:48:30] he says
[1:48:32] you don't use the gift of god for a
[1:48:34] commercial no no
[1:48:36] he could tell me where it's at but you
[1:48:38] don't have any need of it see i wouldn't
[1:48:40] even have faith enough to ask him see if
[1:48:42] i had in need of it i believe if i'd ask
[1:48:45] him he'd tell me
[1:48:47] he says but first
[1:48:49] first you see
[1:48:51] your motives and objectives has to be
[1:48:53] right
[1:48:54] right you have to have reasons for this
[1:48:57] see
[1:48:58] god don't give you those things just
[1:49:00] because you ask
[1:49:02] and you cannot ask in faith unless
[1:49:04] there's a real
[1:49:06] objective to that
[1:49:08] you cannot ask in faith see unless
[1:49:10] there's a real objective to that
[1:49:13] see to be in the will of god see if you
[1:49:16] want if you want to be well what you
[1:49:18] want to be if you want to be well he
[1:49:21] says if you want to be well if you're
[1:49:22] sick you want to be well
[1:49:24] he says see
[1:49:27] well
[1:49:28] what do you want to be well for
[1:49:32] see if you want to be healed what's the
[1:49:34] reason you want to be healed
[1:49:36] what are you telling god what do you
[1:49:38] want to do with your life when you get
[1:49:40] healed
[1:49:41] see
[1:49:42] there's got to be you've got to have a
[1:49:44] motive and objective
[1:49:46] and they have to be right according to
[1:49:49] the will of god
[1:49:51] hallelujah
[1:49:53] and then
[1:49:54] and then when the faith is revealed to
[1:49:56] you then's when the faith
[1:49:59] then the fate is revealed to you
[1:50:02] right
[1:50:03] and god by his sovereign grace places
[1:50:06] that faith in there then it's over
[1:50:11] see
[1:50:17] and he says and and he says but
[1:50:21] because of selfishness talking about the
[1:50:24] oil people
[1:50:25] the object got among it the objectives
[1:50:28] was wrong
[1:50:29] signing up in a bunch of stuff it would
[1:50:31] be this way and then so on when they
[1:50:33] promised they would do it for the
[1:50:34] kingdom of god
[1:50:35] see but looked like it was for
[1:50:37] themselves
[1:50:39] and it won't work he says no selfish
[1:50:42] thing will work your motives and
[1:50:44] objectives has to be exactly perfectly
[1:50:46] right then you have faith there
[1:50:49] see and that's what first john says if
[1:50:51] our hearts condemn us not
[1:50:53] then we have confidence with god amen
[1:50:56] then you have confidence to go on your
[1:50:58] knees and pray and everything is good
[1:51:01] between you and god when all the
[1:51:04] channels and all the flus are blowed out
[1:51:06] you know what i mean
[1:51:07] and and and you get that pathway clear
[1:51:11] between you and god
[1:51:13] because you're his child
[1:51:15] amen father and son father and daughter
[1:51:19] right
[1:51:24] he says
[1:51:26] then we have confidence see we've got to
[1:51:29] have confidence i want this to be to be
[1:51:32] to the honor and the glory of god
[1:51:34] then faith has a channel to move in
[1:51:38] faith has that channel to move in see
[1:51:39] faith has got to have that channel to
[1:51:42] move in
[1:51:43] right that channel has to be clear if it
[1:51:45] doesn't then you've got mental
[1:51:47] intellectual faith and not genuine faith
[1:51:49] from god that intellectual faith will
[1:51:52] get you no worse might get you emotional
[1:51:54] but it won't get you the healing that
[1:51:56] you're looking for
[1:51:58] excuse me so job checking himself with
[1:52:01] the genuine faith that god had given to
[1:52:03] him
[1:52:04] that he was just
[1:52:06] pardon me that he had done everything
[1:52:08] that god required him to do
[1:52:11] and he says now when we're going to be
[1:52:13] prayed for for our sickness i wonder if
[1:52:15] we've done everything that god requires
[1:52:18] us to do have we followed every iota of
[1:52:20] the scripture have we given him our
[1:52:23] hearts
[1:52:24] and lives to service
[1:52:26] have we
[1:52:28] what's the reason you want to be healed
[1:52:29] that's the reason
[1:52:32] that's the reason you can't get faith
[1:52:34] enough seed because you haven't maybe
[1:52:36] make this thing to god sincerely from
[1:52:38] your heart like hezekiah did
[1:52:41] give god
[1:52:42] give god the reason he wants to set his
[1:52:45] kingdom in order that was hezekiah
[1:52:47] and god sent his prophet back and told
[1:52:49] him and and he'd be healed see but have
[1:52:52] those things made right first see so
[1:52:54] then as soon as you get to those places
[1:52:57] and know that it's been revealed to you
[1:52:59] by the word of god by the revelation by
[1:53:01] the word that god requires you to do
[1:53:04] then you have faith
[1:53:06] genuine
[1:53:07] faith
[1:53:09] amen amen
[1:53:12] is there a clock here someplace
[1:53:18] what time does that say
[1:53:20] i can't see it from here i can see the
[1:53:22] clock but i can't see the handset
[1:53:26] 12
[1:53:27] 47
[1:53:29] when did i start
[1:53:32] 12 46.
[1:53:42] i could figure out
[1:53:44] when did i start really
[1:53:50] quarter to 12 and now it's 12 45.
[1:53:53] is that a half an hour
[1:53:57] 62 minutes
[1:54:00] okay
[1:54:02] that's good i thought man i'm getting
[1:54:04] slower and slower and slower
[1:54:07] not getting nothing done
[1:54:14] we just read one more here
[1:54:16] it's about our father abraham
[1:54:19] he's always a good subject amen
[1:54:22] amen
[1:54:24] i don't i don't want to
[1:54:26] to go for half an hour more but i'll
[1:54:28] just i'll just read this
[1:54:31] now just like abraham when he was 99
[1:54:34] years old
[1:54:35] i believe genesis 17 god appeared to
[1:54:38] this old man old man
[1:54:41] so old man
[1:54:44] 73 73 not so old
[1:54:47] not so old i don't think they
[1:54:51] right but
[1:54:53] god appears to old men i just want you
[1:54:55] to know that
[1:54:58] now 90 and 90 years old so we got a long
[1:55:01] ways to go brother gerald
[1:55:04] 20 years is a
[1:55:06] a long time when
[1:55:09] when he was almost 100 years old that
[1:55:11] had been waiting upon that promise all
[1:55:13] these years
[1:55:15] he appeared to him in the name of el
[1:55:17] shaddai
[1:55:19] the breasted one
[1:55:21] and what an encouragement it was
[1:55:24] yet the promise wasn't fulfilled then
[1:55:27] see
[1:55:28] but abraham
[1:55:31] he says i am the almighty god ill shadow
[1:55:34] the strength giver the breasted god
[1:55:37] like i've told you before like the
[1:55:39] little baby that's fritting and sick and
[1:55:41] crying and it lays upon its mother's
[1:55:44] breast
[1:55:45] and nurses its strength back from her
[1:55:48] because it's satisfied while it's
[1:55:50] nursing because the only access it has
[1:55:54] and knows off is the mother's breast
[1:55:57] and it knows no dose of medicine you
[1:56:00] might give him a dose of medicine he'll
[1:56:02] squeal and cry
[1:56:04] give him a shot in the arm and he'll
[1:56:05] carry on but the only access to satisfy
[1:56:08] him is the mother's breast
[1:56:11] and he said abraham you're old your
[1:56:13] strength is gone your arms are withered
[1:56:16] up
[1:56:16] your manhood's gone but i am your mother
[1:56:20] just take a hold of my promise be
[1:56:23] satisfied while you're waiting
[1:56:25] be satisfied while you're waiting
[1:56:28] job was the yaniya sheep he was
[1:56:30] satisfied
[1:56:32] while he waited
[1:56:33] he couldn't they couldn't move him they
[1:56:35] couldn't budge him
[1:56:37] he was rock solid
[1:56:40] yes they couldn't budge joke
[1:56:48] be rested now that's the way every
[1:56:51] believer no matter how bad the cancer
[1:56:53] has got you
[1:56:54] how long you've been in a wheelchair or
[1:56:56] any of these things
[1:56:58] just if you can grasp that revelation
[1:57:00] from god
[1:57:02] then he then be satisfied
[1:57:05] if you can grasp that revelation from
[1:57:07] god
[1:57:08] god is right god is he is a rewarder of
[1:57:12] those that diligently seek him
[1:57:15] god is
[1:57:17] see
[1:57:28] then be satisfied knowing that it's
[1:57:30] going to happen because faith waits
[1:57:33] patiently for diplomacy
[1:57:36] job knew that he was right
[1:57:39] when we find out here in the scripture
[1:57:41] that
[1:57:42] them fellows come to him them church
[1:57:44] members everything that once seemed dear
[1:57:46] to him had turned against him and tried
[1:57:48] to accuse him of being a secret sinner
[1:57:51] all of these things happen to him you
[1:57:52] hear people yet today say i told you
[1:57:55] look at him
[1:57:58] i told you
[1:58:00] right
[1:58:01] everybody got their own ideas
[1:58:03] right
[1:58:07] right
[1:58:09] see that that ain't all together the
[1:58:12] truth he says and i spoke this before to
[1:58:15] you sometimes it's god testing his
[1:58:17] people
[1:58:18] in this case it was god testing job
[1:58:21] the best man there was on the earth at
[1:58:23] the time
[1:58:24] now he was holding him then because he
[1:58:27] knew that job was a prophet that had a
[1:58:29] vision from god that he had exactly done
[1:58:32] what god told them to do see god was
[1:58:35] duty bound to keep his promise to him
[1:58:39] oh all christians has got to be that has
[1:58:42] got to be that
[1:58:44] when the last struggle of our life comes
[1:58:48] and death rattles in our throat
[1:58:50] we still must hold steady and remember
[1:58:53] that god said i'll raise him up at the
[1:58:56] last day
[1:58:57] right see
[1:58:59] got to hold that on our testimony our
[1:59:02] place in christ our position
[1:59:05] when we what we are
[1:59:07] knowing that we have
[1:59:09] kept every word of his commandment
[1:59:11] blessed are they that do his
[1:59:13] commandments that they might have the
[1:59:15] right to enter in
[1:59:16] and when we know
[1:59:18] that no matter what anyone has said
[1:59:22] we've kept every commandment
[1:59:24] that we see in the bible that god has
[1:59:27] told us to do with reverence and love
[1:59:30] and respect
[1:59:31] to the creator who wrote the bible
[1:59:35] there you go
[1:59:41] and i'll
