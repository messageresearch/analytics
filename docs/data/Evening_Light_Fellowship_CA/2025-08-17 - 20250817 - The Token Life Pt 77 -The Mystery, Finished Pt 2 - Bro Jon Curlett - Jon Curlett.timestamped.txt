[40:14] Where my feet are on the far.
[40:18] Hallelujah. Amen. I want to hide where
[40:24] the cars of this world get out.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:30] Thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord.
[40:33] Hallelujah.
[40:35] Oh, in your presence.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; That's where I am strong. In your
[40:43] presence.
[40:46] Hallelujah.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:50] in your presence
[40:53] [Music]
[40:55] when I Yes. Amen.
[40:59] Seeking your hallelujah.
[41:02] Touching your grace. Amen.
[41:14] In your presence. Oh God, I want to
[41:19] hide.
[41:21] I want to hide where the blood of evil
[41:27] cannot.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Where I'm covered by the
[41:32] blood. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[41:34] Hallelujah.
[41:36] I want to be away when this darkness
[41:42] cannot touch me
[41:44] in your presence. Amen. Let's all stand.
[41:50] In your presence,
[41:53] [Music]
[41:55] that's where I am. In your presence.
[42:01] Hallelujah.
[42:02] Lord my God in your presence
[42:10] that's where I belong. Amen.
[42:13] Seeking your face
[42:16] [Music]
[42:18] your grace.
[42:20] Hallelujah.
[42:22] In the cl of the rock. Praise the Lord.
[42:27] Hallelujah.
[42:29] In your presence, oh God.
[42:35] In your presence.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; In your presence,
[42:46] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[42:54] that's where I belong.
[42:58] seeking your face,
[43:02] touching your grace
[43:06] in the cliff of the rock.
[43:13] It's in your presence, oh God,
[43:19] and in your presence.
[43:22] [Music]
[43:24] That's where I am strong. In your
[43:28] presence,
[43:31] [Music]
[43:33] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[43:40] [Music]
[43:42] that's where I belong.
[43:46] seeking your face.
[43:51] Touching your grace
[43:56] in the cliff of the rock.
[44:04] In your presence, oh God,
[44:10] and in your presence,
[44:15] that's where I am strong. In your
[44:19] presence,
[44:22] oh Lord,
[44:25] in your presence
[44:30] after I
[44:34] seeking your face,
[44:37] touching your grace
[44:42] in the cliff of the God,
[44:49] it's in your presence, oh God.
[44:55] Amen, Lord Jesus.
[44:59] Lord, that's the only place of peace.
[45:03] It's the only place of rest. It's our
[45:04] only assurance,
[45:06] Lord. It's our only comfort,
[45:10] Lord. It's when we're with you,
[45:13] Lord. Lord, when we can rest in the
[45:14] shelter of your wings, in the shadow of
[45:16] the rock that was smitten for our sins,
[45:19] Lord Jesus,
[45:22] Lord, when we're back where we came
[45:24] from,
[45:26] Lord, I pray you help us to lift our
[45:27] eyes a little higher today,
[45:30] Lord, to see where we belong, Lord, to
[45:33] see what is our inheritance, our
[45:34] birthright. Lord, the place of perfect
[45:37] unity and rest is only with you,
[45:41] Lord. It's through your word. It's
[45:42] through your spirit,
[45:44] Lord. It's when it all comes together,
[45:46] Lord. It's the unity of the faith, Lord,
[45:48] that draws us back into the perfection
[45:50] that we came out of in your mind in the
[45:52] very beginning of all things, heavenly
[45:54] father.
[45:56] So, Lord, I pray you take us once again
[45:58] in this service.
[46:00] Lord, may you bring us closer to you.
[46:03] Lord, help us to separate all the more
[46:05] from the world and the things of this
[46:06] world, from our mind, our thoughts, our
[46:08] ideas, our preferences, our feelings.
[46:10] Lord, all the things, Lord, that would
[46:12] hold us back. Let us lay it down today,
[46:14] Lord, so we could be in your presence,
[46:16] Lord, under the hearing of your word.
[46:18] Grant us grace, Lord, grant us grace to
[46:21] see you today, Lord. Bless your people
[46:24] now, Lord. We pray their worship's been
[46:26] acceptable, Lord. That their praise has
[46:29] been, Lord, a a sweet savor in your in
[46:32] your in your nose, Lord. That it's been
[46:34] a wonderful time for you. But Lord, now
[46:37] we're asking you to speak,
[46:39] Lord. For the main event is when you
[46:41] talk, Lord, when you come and you reach
[46:44] into our lives, Lord, and you trim and
[46:46] you cut and you do the surgery, Lord,
[46:48] that takes away those things that hinder
[46:50] us back, Lord, and sets us free, Lord,
[46:52] to serve you in a greater way, Lord. I
[46:55] pray your word would do some surgery
[46:56] here in our lives tonight, Lord. That we
[46:59] would willingly lay ourselves down
[47:00] before you. Grace to us now, each one we
[47:03] pray, Lord God, in Jesus Christ's name
[47:05] we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[47:08] Turn if you would to Colossians 1.
[47:10] Certainly enjoyed listening to the song
[47:12] service in there this morning. Amen. God
[47:14] bless you. God bless you. It's good to
[47:16] see each one. Good to see the whiffins
[47:18] with us again. Good to see brother
[47:20] Garfield. He looks like he's going to a
[47:21] wedding. Maybe he should be preaching
[47:23] instead of me up here this morning. But
[47:24] it's good to see him. Good to see each
[47:26] one that's here. Amen. And most of you
[47:29] probably would have seen the email this
[47:31] morning from Brother Matt notifying
[47:32] about the special meetings and the and
[47:34] the schedule. So, we've got no service
[47:36] on Friday, as you know, but Friday night
[47:38] at 7:00, Saturday at 5:30 in the
[47:42] evening, and then Sunday at 11 as our
[47:44] usual time. We'll also have a brunch
[47:46] here at the church in the fellowship
[47:48] hall at 10:30 on Saturday. And then
[47:50] we'll have our fellowship, our food
[47:52] after the service on Sunday as we always
[47:54] do. So, each one's always welcome for
[47:56] that. Amen. We trust each one can make
[47:58] it. Amen. We want to thank the Lord for
[48:00] the rain. Amen. We really got hammered
[48:02] there for that while and it certainly
[48:03] helped dampen things down and slow it
[48:05] down. So, we have no evacuation uh
[48:08] alerts, you know, for this local area
[48:10] and it's cut things back I see on
[48:11] Conception Bay North and whatnot. So, we
[48:13] thank the Lord for that. We also thank
[48:15] the Lord. It wasn't looking so good for
[48:17] us getting our preacher in for next
[48:19] weekend because of the strike, but uh
[48:21] the federal government has declared that
[48:23] they have to go into binding
[48:24] arbitration. So, they have to maintain
[48:26] service in the meantime. So, by God's
[48:28] grace, we're trusting Brother Aaron will
[48:29] be able to come in and minister for us
[48:30] next weekend. Of course, his wife,
[48:32] Sister Lydia, will be with us as well.
[48:35] Amen. So, just keep that in prayer and
[48:37] uh that the Lord would just move in a
[48:39] special way that uh lives would be
[48:41] changed, hearts would be filled. Amen.
[48:44] That people would see themselves in the
[48:46] light of the word. Amen. And see who
[48:48] they are. Amen. Colossians chapter 1
[48:51] verse 25 says, "Whereof I am made a
[48:54] minister according to the dispensation
[48:56] of God which is given to me for you to
[48:59] fulfill the word of God, even the
[49:01] mystery which had been hid from ages and
[49:04] from generations, but is now made
[49:06] manifest to his saints." I want you to
[49:08] notice who the manifestation is to.
[49:12] There's only one group going to know it,
[49:14] and it's his saints. the manifestation,
[49:15] the revealing, the reality of it is to
[49:17] the chosen elect people. Others will see
[49:20] it, but they won't recognize it for what
[49:21] it is. Amen. Unless they're a part of
[49:24] that group. I'm not talking about a a
[49:26] church or a group. I'm talking about the
[49:28] elect lady, the bride of Jesus Christ.
[49:30] Amen. She spread all over this world.
[49:32] Amen. I'm talking about those that have
[49:34] something in them that God put in them.
[49:35] Those are the ones that will see it,
[49:37] that will have the reality of it, that
[49:38] will recognize it. He says, "To whom God
[49:41] would make known what is the riches of
[49:42] the glory of this mystery among the
[49:44] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[49:47] hope of glory?" And I'll read verse 28
[49:49] as well. He says, "Whom we preach,
[49:51] warning every man and teaching every man
[49:54] in all wisdom with what purpose? That we
[49:56] may present every man, every man perfect
[50:01] in Christ Jesus." Amen. God bless you.
[50:02] You can have your seats again this
[50:04] morning. And I'm taking another service
[50:06] I started. We're still in our series on
[50:08] the Holy Ghost, the token life. And we
[50:10] started this this uh title of the
[50:13] mystery finished in in in our service uh
[50:15] last week, but we want to continue there
[50:17] on the foundation that we laid there.
[50:19] And I highly recommend if you didn't
[50:21] listen to that, if you weren't here,
[50:23] please go listen to it because it's easy
[50:25] to get left behind. If we're only
[50:27] catching snippets here and there, we're
[50:28] going to have misunderstandings. We're
[50:30] going to miss things. It's not maybe
[50:31] going to make sense the way we ought to.
[50:33] It'd be like going and writing an an
[50:35] algebra test and you didn't do your
[50:37] multiplication and your addition
[50:38] beforehand. You've got to know what the
[50:40] basics are before you move into the
[50:42] heavier things. And so when we set a
[50:44] foundation, it's because as we build on
[50:46] it, I can't go back and explain
[50:48] everything again. I I preach it as a as
[50:50] to set it up in a in a way that makes
[50:52] sense and flows cleanly. And so I
[50:54] recommend you go back and listen to
[50:55] that. But we spoke last service. I'll
[50:57] just do a brief kind of synopsis of
[50:59] where we were about the choosing of God
[51:01] and that he has a predestinated and an
[51:04] ordained people. Amen. He has a family.
[51:06] He has a bride that's elected by him.
[51:08] And that happened a long time before we
[51:10] ever came into existence. Amen. It
[51:11] happened in his mind and then he spoke
[51:13] it out by his word. And then we see that
[51:15] he created Adam in his image. So what
[51:18] Adam is is a reflection of what God is.
[51:20] And so God made this man in his image.
[51:23] And then he said, "Hey, it's not good
[51:24] for man to dwell alone." And so he took
[51:26] a part out of that man. And from that
[51:29] part, he made a woman. And that woman
[51:31] was an expression of the man. Amen. The
[51:34] woman was an expression of Adam. She
[51:36] wasn't all of Adam, but everything that
[51:38] she was was Adam. There was nothing in
[51:41] her that wasn't Adam. Everything that
[51:43] she was built out of, the same DNA, the
[51:45] same block. She was bone of his bone,
[51:47] flesh of his flesh, and and everything
[51:49] that she had came from Adam. And so she
[51:51] was Adam. But she was just a portion, a
[51:54] partial expression of Adam. But
[51:56] nonetheless, she was a manifestation of
[51:58] Adam. Her identity was in Adam. Amen.
[52:00] Her name was in Adam. Her design was in
[52:02] Adam. Everything she had was tied back
[52:05] to Adam. And it was a beautiful type of
[52:07] Christ and his bride today. Amen. What
[52:10] God said was good for Adam was what God
[52:12] had in his own heart to produce for
[52:14] himself. Amen. And the process that God
[52:17] used for Adam is the same process that
[52:19] God is using for his bride today. And
[52:22] then afterwards we spoke of Zion the
[52:24] which is always a reference to the bride
[52:26] of Christ in the scripture. And we read
[52:28] there in Psalms how it said that she is
[52:30] the chosen dwelling place of God and how
[52:32] God said he would clean the filth out of
[52:34] her and he would make her a place for
[52:36] his rest. Amen. We spoke how we were
[52:39] chosen to be holy and blameless before
[52:41] God. Not that we were chosen because we
[52:44] were holy. We were chosen to become
[52:46] holy. Amen. He didn't choose us based on
[52:49] our condition. He chose us based on what
[52:51] he thought of us before the foundation
[52:54] of the world. Amen. So we are choosing
[52:56] to be holy and that's by the working of
[52:58] God in our life. It's the washing of
[53:00] water by the word and it's the covering
[53:02] of the blood of Jesus Christ. And then
[53:05] we read the scripture where it said that
[53:07] Zion cannot be removed forever. In other
[53:10] words, she's in place. She cannot
[53:11] change. Amen. Nothing can destroy her.
[53:14] Nothing can keep her from becoming the
[53:16] resting place, the dwelling place of
[53:18] God. She will be his dwelling place
[53:21] forever. That is the promise to the
[53:23] bride of Christ. But the point we were
[53:25] making in all of this was to understand
[53:27] the eternal nature of the bride of Jesus
[53:30] Christ. Amen. She is elected because she
[53:33] was in his mind before the foundation of
[53:36] the world. It was his choosing. And he
[53:38] wrote the names of those people in the
[53:40] lamb's book of life. Before they ever
[53:42] did good, before they did evil, before
[53:44] they made a mistake, before they
[53:46] accepted him, he wrote their names as
[53:49] individuals in the Lamb's book of life.
[53:51] The only chapter where you cannot have a
[53:53] name removed.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Every name's written, but many can be
[53:57] removed. But in the Lamb's book of life,
[53:59] they are written, and they cannot be
[54:00] removed. They're engraved in the palms
[54:02] of his hand. They're written with his
[54:04] own blood. It cannot be erased. Amen.
[54:06] They are secure. And so, nothing can
[54:09] stop them. Nothing can break them.
[54:11] Nothing can hold them back. Nothing can
[54:13] overcome them forever. Church, you're
[54:16] going to be fighting things until the
[54:17] day that we leave here, but nothing will
[54:19] hold you back from going in that
[54:21] resurrection and that rapture if your
[54:23] name is written in the Lamb's book of
[54:24] life. Amen. Can you say amen this
[54:26] morning? That's what we're preaching
[54:28] this morning. This is the end of this,
[54:30] not this service, but this is the apex
[54:32] of this whole series on the Holy Ghost.
[54:34] And it's to bring us to our original
[54:36] position that we had in the mind of God
[54:39] before the foundation of the world.
[54:40] That's what the spirit of God is here to
[54:42] do is to quicken us to what he said we
[54:45] are, who we said we are, and to bring a
[54:47] reality of that into our life. Amen.
[54:50] That is the birthright. That is the
[54:52] inheritance of the bride of Christ
[54:54] because she is a part of the word of
[54:57] God.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "Let every man's word be
[55:01] a lie."
[55:03] But he says, "My word can never fail."
[55:06] And when you're tied into that word,
[55:07] when you're a part of that word, it
[55:09] means that there's an overcoming gene
[55:11] that's put inside of you that cannot
[55:13] fail. Listen, you might lose a battle,
[55:16] but you won't lose the war.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. This flesh may win from time to
[55:20] time, but you're not going to lose the
[55:21] war. Amen. We have our temporary issues.
[55:24] We have our failings. We have our bad
[55:25] decisions. We have our separations. We
[55:28] have these mistakes every day. According
[55:29] to Romans 7, Paul a prophet to the age
[55:32] said, "I do the things that I don't want
[55:34] to do and I don't do the things I want
[55:36] to do." But there came a day where there
[55:38] was a change in his life where he
[55:40] started winning more than he was losing.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. A Corinthian has to turn into
[55:45] Ephesians at some point.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; We got to come to a place where the
[55:49] spirit of God has a conquering attitude
[55:51] in our life. Amen. Where what we have is
[55:54] greater than that which we were born
[55:55] with. Cuz we're under a new birth now.
[55:58] We're under a new creation. We're under
[55:59] a new order. We're under a new covenant
[56:01] that changes the way we operate. And
[56:03] it's an overcoming spirit that's inside
[56:05] of us. Why? Cuz it's a word gene that's
[56:08] being raised up. It's a word seed that's
[56:10] coming up. And nothing can stop it once
[56:12] it comes to life. It may just be a
[56:15] little stock today, but it's got to be a
[56:17] great restored tree pretty soon. And
[56:19] that cannot be overcome by the winds of
[56:21] life and the storms of life and these
[56:22] different things. Amen.
[56:24] We have our temporary failings. But we
[56:26] see that when we look in the scripture
[56:29] that what God is seeing is faith in the
[56:32] bride because the blood of Jesus covers
[56:36] all of those temporary things.
[56:39] We have the washing of water by the
[56:41] word. Remember when Jesus was having
[56:43] communion with his disciples and
[56:44] footwashing and he says, "Listen, you're
[56:46] clean every wit. You're clean every
[56:48] part, but your feet get dirty just in
[56:50] day-to-day life. And there's a washing
[56:52] that has to happen. And that's our
[56:53] day-to-day mistakes, our failures, the
[56:55] things we see. We don't go looking for
[56:57] it, but we see it. Whatever it is,
[56:59] there's a washing that happens. And the
[57:01] blood of Jesus covers those things. And
[57:03] so, all that God can see through that
[57:05] blood is the eternal portion of you, the
[57:07] faith portion inside of that. We look
[57:09] into Hebrews 11 and we see that Abraham
[57:12] made a lot of mistakes, but all God
[57:14] could see through the blood is by faith.
[57:17] By faith. By faith. Abraham did exactly
[57:20] what I told him to do. Amen. When you
[57:22] look at Abraham and Sarah in Hebrews 11,
[57:25] it does not see their mistakes, their
[57:27] manipulation, their failures, their
[57:29] fallings, their lies. All it sees is by
[57:32] faith, by faith, by faith, they achieved
[57:35] what I told them to achieve. They
[57:36] believe what I told them to believe and
[57:38] then I produce by faith the thing that
[57:40] they were holding on to. Amen. All you
[57:43] could see through God's eyes is that
[57:44] they believed and they acted on his
[57:47] word. church, that ought to give us some
[57:48] confidence this morning that through the
[57:51] blood, all he can see is the eternal
[57:53] faith of God coming through us to
[57:55] produce his word. Amen. Hallelujah. In
[57:58] Hebrews 11, God doesn't see Abram.
[58:01] See, he was born Abram.
[58:04] But in Hebrews 11, the name Abram is
[58:06] never mentioned. All that's mentioned is
[58:08] Abraham, the new creation, the name of
[58:11] God that was added to his name to make
[58:13] him a part of the word. All that we saw,
[58:17] we don't see Sarai. We say Sarah.
[58:21] Why? Because in the through the blood of
[58:23] Christ, all he can see is that name from
[58:25] before the foundation of the world. All
[58:27] he can see is the child of God,
[58:31] not the child of hell that this flesh
[58:33] is.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He can't see the temporal. All he can
[58:36] see is the eternal through the blood of
[58:37] Jesus Christ. Amen. So all he could see
[58:40] them in in Hebrews 11 is their promised
[58:42] condition,
[58:44] &gt;&gt; not their natural condition. Hallelujah.
[58:46] I'll take that every day. I'll take that
[58:48] every day that that's all he can see.
[58:50] All he could see was their faith in
[58:52] possession of the word of God.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; That's where you're standing this
[58:56] morning. Amen. That's what the blood of
[58:57] Jesus does is it filters out the
[58:59] temporary and it brings the eternal into
[59:01] focus. Amen. It's a wonderful thing to
[59:03] be a child of God. I say, "Praise the
[59:05] Lord this morning." Amen. That's the
[59:07] beauty of the scriptures though is that
[59:09] we can look backwards and we can see
[59:11] what God did, what God promised, and how
[59:13] he fulfilled it and the people that were
[59:15] involved and we see it in a way that
[59:17] they couldn't. They couldn't see
[59:20] everything in the big picture like that.
[59:21] Amen. We have that perfect hindsight
[59:24] today because we can see in the
[59:25] scriptures how God made the promise and
[59:28] then we can see the process God put
[59:30] those people through and then we can see
[59:31] the fulfillment.
[59:33] Now, we're preaching on the mystery
[59:35] finished, and the mystery finished is
[59:36] going to be the bride of Christ. But we
[59:38] have to see how the other previous
[59:40] mysteries were finished so we can
[59:42] understand how our mystery is going to
[59:44] be finished as well. Amen. If we can
[59:46] understand how they had it happen, we
[59:48] can understand how we can have it to
[59:49] happen. And the goal is for us to see it
[59:51] while it's happening rather than look
[59:52] behind and say, "There it was." Because
[59:54] a bride has to be in the presence of the
[59:56] I am, not the I was or the I will be.
[59:59] She's got to see the the risen Christ in
[1:00:01] her midst. Amen. And a bride that's
[1:00:03] ready for a rapture has to know what's
[1:00:05] going on. Amen. She has to understand
[1:00:07] what's going on. And so we go back to
[1:00:09] our opening scripture where Paul says,
[1:00:10] "I am made a minister according to the
[1:00:12] dispensation of God.
[1:00:15] According to the plan of God, according
[1:00:17] to the timing of God, which is given to
[1:00:20] me to you for what purpose?" Why does
[1:00:23] Paul receive a message?
[1:00:26] This is not Peter's message.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; This is not Peter's message. Peter's
[1:00:31] message came from Jesus Christ. Now Paul
[1:00:35] Paul goes into the desert of Arabia for
[1:00:37] three and a half years. The Holy Spirit
[1:00:39] comes down and teaches him the full
[1:00:41] gospel of Jesus Christ. Not just
[1:00:44] salvation, not just baptism, not just
[1:00:46] the Holy Ghost, but he gives him the
[1:00:48] full mystery of God that's been hidden.
[1:00:50] Why? Because the previous mysteries
[1:00:52] finished. It was finished in Christ. Now
[1:00:54] there's a further revealing that's got
[1:00:56] to happen. There's a mystery that's got
[1:00:58] to be open. And Paul says, "This
[1:01:00] mystery, this this gospel I'm giving is
[1:01:02] given to me to fulfill the word of God
[1:01:06] in you."
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice this. Paul's message is the
[1:01:10] message to all gentile ages. It's to all
[1:01:14] ages. Amen. That's the message we'll be
[1:01:16] judged by. That's what Paul said in
[1:01:18] Romans 2:16. He says, "The whole world
[1:01:20] will be judged by my gospel."
[1:01:23] So, there's no shifting away from this.
[1:01:25] This is it. This is all we've got. Amen.
[1:01:28] But the purpose of f Paul's message is
[1:01:30] to fulfill, to complete, to accomplish,
[1:01:33] to perfect the word of God. And I want
[1:01:35] you to catch that because we know the
[1:01:37] word of God is not spoken just so God
[1:01:39] can hear his voice. God's not sitting
[1:01:42] there because he enjoys the sound of his
[1:01:43] own voice. But he speaks because he's
[1:01:46] got something to produce. And when he
[1:01:48] speaks, he speaks with intention. And it
[1:01:50] cannot go out unless it and come back
[1:01:52] unless it's fulfilled what he he said
[1:01:54] about it. Amen. God speaks so that
[1:01:56] something will happen. So what is the
[1:01:58] fulfillment of God that Paul is talking
[1:02:00] about here? He says this is all given to
[1:02:02] me to fulfill the word of God. What was
[1:02:04] the purpose of all that God had done to
[1:02:06] that point? He says even this the
[1:02:08] mystery which had been hid from ages and
[1:02:11] from generations. But now now is made
[1:02:14] manifest to his saints. The mystery was
[1:02:16] hidden all through time. People didn't
[1:02:18] have a clue what was going on. They just
[1:02:20] thought it catch this. They just thought
[1:02:23] it was life.
[1:02:26] They just thought it was the way things
[1:02:28] were going. They just thought it was a
[1:02:30] good day. They just thought it was a bad
[1:02:31] day. They just thought it was a bad
[1:02:33] decade.
[1:02:35] They just thought it was life. Amen.
[1:02:36] They thought it was an experience. Maybe
[1:02:38] they thought it was God moving here or
[1:02:40] God moving there for with no particular
[1:02:42] rhyme or reason. The mystery was there.
[1:02:44] The pieces were there, but nobody could
[1:02:46] put the whole thing together. People
[1:02:48] just had a part here and a part there,
[1:02:50] but the puzzle wasn't completed. And so
[1:02:52] it was hidden for the big picture was
[1:02:54] hidden from everyone's eyes. Now Paul
[1:02:56] says here there's a people that's going
[1:02:58] to see it and they're not just going to
[1:03:00] see it but they're going to fulfill it.
[1:03:02] They're going to be the puzzle itself
[1:03:05] and they're going to see the big picture
[1:03:07] for what it is. Amen. He's not just
[1:03:09] saying you're going to see it and
[1:03:10] receive it, but you're going to fulfill
[1:03:12] it. In other words, this is a
[1:03:13] participation sport, church. We're not
[1:03:16] sitting in church just hearing the word,
[1:03:18] but we're there to fulfill what we hear
[1:03:21] in our lives by the power of the Holy
[1:03:23] Spirit quickening it. Amen. We are the
[1:03:26] happening. We are the event. We are the
[1:03:30] pieces of the puzzle that reveal this
[1:03:32] mystery. He says what? To whom God would
[1:03:36] make known. Here's the whole thing. He
[1:03:38] says, "What is the riches of the glory
[1:03:41] of this mystery?" Who's he making it
[1:03:43] known to? You.
[1:03:45] You're here to know the glory of the
[1:03:47] riches of this mystery among the
[1:03:49] Gentiles.
[1:03:53] God's been hiding through all the ages,
[1:03:55] through all the generations. It's a
[1:03:58] people with God working in them.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; It's a people chosen and elect to
[1:04:03] fulfill the word for their day. Amen.
[1:04:06] It's Christ in you. It's God in flesh. a
[1:04:09] revealing of the bridegroom through his
[1:04:11] bride the way that Eve was a revealing
[1:04:13] of Adam at the very beginning.
[1:04:16] That's what's going on through all of
[1:04:17] this. Amen. And it's the greater glory.
[1:04:19] It's the glorification of the unity of
[1:04:22] Christ with his bride. Amen. There's a
[1:04:24] oneness that must happen. And it is a an
[1:04:26] invisible union between the heavenly
[1:04:28] bridegroom and the earthly bride. She is
[1:04:31] bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh,
[1:04:33] and spirit of his spirit. It's one and
[1:04:36] the same thing. She is him.
[1:04:39] She is not all of him, but she is him.
[1:04:41] Amen. She's the mystery revealed that
[1:04:44] God's been hiding all along in types and
[1:04:46] shadows throughout the Old Testament.
[1:04:48] Paul would say this in the Corinth
[1:04:49] second Corinthians. He says, "For I
[1:04:50] determined not to know anything among
[1:04:52] you, save Jesus Christ and him
[1:04:54] crucified. And I was with you in
[1:04:56] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:04:58] trembling. And my speech and my
[1:05:00] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:05:03] men's wisdom, but in demonstration of
[1:05:05] the spirit and of power." See, he's
[1:05:08] revealing the mystery. But the m mystery
[1:05:10] isn't coming by slick preaching or by
[1:05:12] entertainment or by charisma. No, it's
[1:05:15] coming by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:17] It's the word being revealed from
[1:05:19] heaven. Amen. He says, "Why that your
[1:05:21] faith should not stand in the wisdom of
[1:05:23] men, but in the power of God?" He says,
[1:05:26] "How be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:05:28] that are perfect, them that are mature."
[1:05:31] He says, "Yet not the wisdom of this
[1:05:33] world, nor of the princes of this world
[1:05:35] that come to not." He says, "But we
[1:05:37] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery."
[1:05:42] In other words, in something that is not
[1:05:44] apparent or obvious to everyone. He
[1:05:47] says, uh, in a mystery, even the hidden
[1:05:51] wisdom, the mystery that's been hidden
[1:05:54] in all ages and generations, he says,
[1:05:57] which God ordained when?
[1:06:01] before the world.
[1:06:03] Unto whose glory?
[1:06:07] Unto our glory. I say glory this morning
[1:06:11] that God before the foundation of the
[1:06:14] world had a hidden mystery, a hidden
[1:06:16] wisdom that was going to be our
[1:06:18] glorification as well.
[1:06:21] Amen. It's not just him. He's got us
[1:06:23] dragged along with it.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's another I I I I want us to
[1:06:27] consider this verse, the depths of it.
[1:06:29] In the Common English Bible, it says,
[1:06:31] "We talk about God's wisdom. We preach
[1:06:33] God's wisdom, which has been hidden as a
[1:06:35] secret." He says, "God determined this
[1:06:38] wisdom in advance before time began for
[1:06:43] our glory." What's been hidden from all
[1:06:45] time? What's been hidden? What is it?
[1:06:48] It's the election and choosing of a
[1:06:50] bride, a people for God, from God, taken
[1:06:54] out of his side. Amen. That they would
[1:06:56] be glorified in this mystery revealing.
[1:06:58] In other words, church, this mystery
[1:07:01] elevates them from what they think they
[1:07:03] are to what they always were. It raises
[1:07:07] their eyes. It raises their mind. It
[1:07:09] raises their spirit. It raises their
[1:07:12] expectations way beyond this carnality
[1:07:14] that we're satisfied with here. And it
[1:07:17] takes us to a place where nothing will
[1:07:19] satisfy us except this mystery being
[1:07:21] revealed in our life. That's what this
[1:07:23] message is doing is it's raising our
[1:07:25] eyes a little higher. It's drawing us
[1:07:28] back to our bridegroom.
[1:07:30] But this one has to die down here.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; This marriage, this husband of this
[1:07:36] world has to die before we can marry.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; We've got to lay it down. It's got to
[1:07:41] rot. It's got to corrupt. It's got to
[1:07:43] fail. It's got to die and be buried so
[1:07:46] we can be married to Christ. That's the
[1:07:48] only way it's going to work. Amen. But
[1:07:50] in other words, this mystery, it
[1:07:52] elevates us back to the thinking of God
[1:07:54] before the foundation of the world. It
[1:07:56] takes us out of our situations. It takes
[1:07:58] us out of our conditions, out of our
[1:08:00] circumstances, out of our thoughts, out
[1:08:02] of our natural heritage, and it restores
[1:08:04] us back to what he said about us, to
[1:08:06] what he thought about us, to our names
[1:08:08] that he wrote on the Lamb's Book of
[1:08:09] Life. You know, we write we spoke last
[1:08:11] service about that woman at the well of
[1:08:13] Samaria and how broken and how messed up
[1:08:16] she was. She had married and divorced
[1:08:18] five times. She was living common law
[1:08:19] with a man, rejected by society, broken
[1:08:22] in her religion, and trying to just find
[1:08:25] something that would satisfy her and
[1:08:28] couldn't seem to find it. Amen. And then
[1:08:30] Jesus says, "I have to go by Samaria."
[1:08:33] And he took the harder route. He took
[1:08:34] the route that people would criticize
[1:08:36] him for taking for going and spending
[1:08:38] time with the people they thought he
[1:08:40] ought not to spend time with. He says,
[1:08:42] "I've got to go by there." Why? Because
[1:08:45] it was a mystery of the hidden wisdom of
[1:08:47] the election of God. That there was a
[1:08:50] woman there before she ever did one
[1:08:53] thing wrong. Church, she was a child of
[1:08:54] God.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Before she married the first husband,
[1:08:57] then divorced and the second, the third,
[1:08:59] the fourth, and the fifth, and now
[1:09:01] living in sin, common law. Before any of
[1:09:03] that ever happened, in advance, before
[1:09:05] God began, there was a wisdom that said,
[1:09:07] "She's a child of God."
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That before she could ever
[1:09:12] make a mistake, before she could ever
[1:09:14] mess it up, he says, "I'll clean up her
[1:09:16] filth.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; I'll take her out of her circumstances."
[1:09:19] Amen. And in that presence of Christ,
[1:09:21] she realizes who he is. And the
[1:09:24] recognition of him changes her life.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; The recognition of him. But church, what
[1:09:30] she didn't realize at that moment is
[1:09:32] when she realized who he was, then it
[1:09:34] was a pointing to a recognition of who
[1:09:36] she was. She just didn't catch it then.
[1:09:39] When she recognized who she who he was,
[1:09:42] that ought to have told her who she was.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; But it was a mystery still hidden
[1:09:45] because the day of Pentecost hadn't come
[1:09:46] yet. Amen. Why? Because the word comes
[1:09:49] to the word.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; The word comes to the word and the re
[1:09:52] the word reveals itself to the word. It
[1:09:55] was the deep calling to the deep. The
[1:09:57] mystery on that day was hidden from her
[1:09:58] and all she could see was him. Amen. But
[1:10:01] there was coming a day when she would
[1:10:03] see him in her. And that's the day that
[1:10:04] her life would totally be changed. Amen.
[1:10:06] It wasn't until Peter came down to
[1:10:08] Samaria and he prayed and laid hands on
[1:10:10] them that she would have received the
[1:10:11] Holy Ghost. But in that day she
[1:10:13] realized, hey, there's a mystery being
[1:10:15] revealed. And it's not just Christ in
[1:10:16] that body, but now it's Christ in me,
[1:10:18] the hope of glory. And she was never the
[1:10:20] same again. I would love to hear her
[1:10:22] story, church. how her life turned
[1:10:24] around and she came into fellowship and
[1:10:26] she came into unity and she came into
[1:10:28] oneness and she got into a body of
[1:10:29] believers that accepted her and loved
[1:10:31] her. Why? Because she was part of the
[1:10:33] mystery.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; She was part of the body ordained before
[1:10:36] the foundation of the world. Amen. She
[1:10:39] realized, I'm a child of God.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. What a day that must
[1:10:43] have been. Look at Rahab, a prostitute
[1:10:46] born into an idol worshippping family.
[1:10:49] Amen. Broken body and spirit, used and
[1:10:51] abused by men. church, we'd look at her
[1:10:53] and say, "She's bound for hell."
[1:10:57] Bound for hell. Amen. But God, rich in
[1:11:00] mercy, before time began, had decreed
[1:11:04] that her circumstances, her raising, her
[1:11:07] family, her life would not hold her
[1:11:09] back.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; You would say, "It's impossible. She's
[1:11:13] in a city with with walls that have
[1:11:16] never been breached. The city's never
[1:11:18] been taken. It's never been conquered.
[1:11:20] She's on the wall. She's in the greatest
[1:11:22] part. How are we ever going to get the
[1:11:24] word to her? Guess what? The word comes
[1:11:25] to the word. God made a way. God made a
[1:11:28] way. Amen. And what happened is when the
[1:11:30] word came to her, she asked for mercy.
[1:11:33] She asked for mercy. She said, "I
[1:11:35] believe.
[1:11:36] I don't know anything else, but I
[1:11:38] believe that he's the real God." And
[1:11:40] when she responded to that, what did God
[1:11:42] do? Church, God gave her mercy. And in a
[1:11:45] day, in a day, he erased her past. She
[1:11:49] had nobody that could say she's a
[1:11:51] prostitute.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; They had nobody that could say she's
[1:11:54] failed. She's a mess. She's broken. And
[1:11:56] she was return to Israel as if she'd
[1:11:59] never done it in the first place.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; What am I saying this morning? I'm
[1:12:06] saying don't let your circumstances hold
[1:12:08] you back.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Don't look at this body. Don't look at
[1:12:11] your family. Don't look at your past.
[1:12:13] Don't look at your circumstances. Say,
[1:12:14] "Lord, I'm coming home."
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; That's all he's looking for. Amen.
[1:12:19] Hallelujah. God's been showing all this
[1:12:22] time through men and women.
[1:12:25] But it was always partial. It was just a
[1:12:27] little bit here. It was just a little
[1:12:29] bit there. It was just a glimpse, a
[1:12:30] portion of Christ being expressed. We
[1:12:32] see it in David when he wrote in the
[1:12:34] Psalms. He says, "My bones, my bones,
[1:12:36] they stare at me. They part my garments
[1:12:39] upon themselves. They cast lots." What
[1:12:41] was it?
[1:12:44] They didn't cast David's lots. at lots
[1:12:46] for David's garments. David couldn't see
[1:12:49] his bones. But was it? It was Christ
[1:12:52] expressing himself through David. And
[1:12:54] David couldn't even tell you why he did
[1:12:56] it. Couldn't even tell you why he wrote
[1:12:58] it. David, a rejected king, coming out
[1:13:01] of Jerusalem.
[1:13:03] And what does he do? He stops and he
[1:13:05] weeps over Jerusalem. Why? Because
[1:13:08] Christ would come later and mourn over
[1:13:09] Jerusalem as well. Watch what happens.
[1:13:12] He comes out of Jerusalem and Shimi
[1:13:13] comes out and he starts to curse him and
[1:13:15] throw stones at him. What does David do?
[1:13:18] Job says, "Let me take the head off that
[1:13:20] dog." He says, "Maybe the Lord told him
[1:13:21] to do it." See, church, everyone wants
[1:13:24] the power and authority of Christ.
[1:13:27] Nobody wants the character cuz we see
[1:13:29] the character in David here. Amen. And
[1:13:32] that's a process that we have to go
[1:13:34] through. Amen. But it wasn't David. It
[1:13:36] was Christ and David foreshadowing the
[1:13:38] reality of God in flesh later on. Amen.
[1:13:41] Christ standing over Jerusalem,
[1:13:42] groaning, mourning over her. Joseph's
[1:13:44] going through life. Amen. And he he he's
[1:13:47] a prophet. He has a a promise of God in
[1:13:49] his life. He has a prophecy over him.
[1:13:51] And then he's betrayed by his family.
[1:13:53] He's sold for a price.
[1:13:56] And he's cast into slavery. And then
[1:13:57] he's his life just gets harder and
[1:13:59] harder. And it can't seem it gets any
[1:14:01] lower. Joseph had a rough couple of
[1:14:04] decades, church.
[1:14:06] A rough couple of decades. But then in a
[1:14:08] single day he was elevated to the right
[1:14:11] hand of Pharaoh. In a moment everything
[1:14:13] changed. And what was it? It was an
[1:14:15] expression of Christ unjustly accused.
[1:14:19] And it seemed like nothing could get him
[1:14:21] out. But in a moment there's a
[1:14:23] resurrection that happened and it placed
[1:14:24] him at the right hand of God. And what
[1:14:26] did he do? He took a gentile bride
[1:14:29] and he put her safely in the palace. And
[1:14:32] then when his brethren came to him for
[1:14:34] food, he forgave them and showed mercy
[1:14:36] and gave them a way of life. Church, it
[1:14:39] wasn't Joseph. It was Christ. It was
[1:14:43] Christ all the way through. Amen. His
[1:14:45] life was a hidden mystery and he didn't
[1:14:48] know what it was revealing. He was
[1:14:51] revealing Christ and he didn't have a
[1:14:52] clue. He just thought it was life. Amen.
[1:14:55] Why did Joseph go through all this?
[1:14:57] Church, I've got a sermon I'm waiting to
[1:14:59] preach and I can't wait to preach it.
[1:15:02] But why did Joseph go through all this?
[1:15:04] You go read in the book of Psalms and it
[1:15:06] says that Joseph had a word and God had
[1:15:09] a word. God had a word about Joseph, but
[1:15:12] God had a bigger word than that. And so
[1:15:15] the word of God tried Joseph until the
[1:15:18] day that Joseph's word came.
[1:15:21] See, we've got a promise of a
[1:15:22] resurrection and a rapture.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; But until then, the word of the Lord's
[1:15:26] got to try us to produce what? Christ in
[1:15:30] flesh again.
[1:15:32] Just a little bit in you, a little bit
[1:15:34] in me. But it's got to produce that same
[1:15:36] thing. Amen.
[1:15:38] All these men, all these women, what was
[1:15:40] it? It was Jesus Christ revealing
[1:15:42] himself. Look at Moses, a mighty
[1:15:44] deliverer, setting the captives free. It
[1:15:46] was a type of Christ. David, the mighty
[1:15:48] king, the conqueror,
[1:15:50] the great warrior, Christ coming back
[1:15:52] with his saints. We look at Solomon, a
[1:15:54] king of peace and rest. Christ in the
[1:15:56] millennium. We look at Joseph, a man of
[1:15:58] sorrows and yet a man of great
[1:15:59] authority. Christ as a son of David,
[1:16:02] Joshua, the mighty conqueror, type of
[1:16:03] Christ. It was all hidden there for us
[1:16:06] to see. But people just thought it was
[1:16:09] God moving.
[1:16:11] But their life was expressing Christ.
[1:16:14] Listen to this. He says, "This book is a
[1:16:15] book of prophecy. Its believers are
[1:16:18] commanded to honor it and read it and
[1:16:19] believe its author. For every word
[1:16:21] that's written in there must come to
[1:16:22] pass. Everything that's been promised
[1:16:24] has to come to pass because it is Jesus
[1:16:27] Christ in each age. He says the same
[1:16:30] yesterday it was Jesus was in Noah. It
[1:16:33] was Jesus Christ in Moses. Remember the
[1:16:35] scripture says of in Moses in Hebrews 11
[1:16:37] esteeming the reproach of who? Christ.
[1:16:43] Christ. It was Christ and Moses. He says
[1:16:45] it was Jesus Christ and Moses. It was
[1:16:47] Jesus Christ and David. It was Jesus
[1:16:49] Christ and Joseph. It's Jesus Christ the
[1:16:51] same yesterday and today and forever.
[1:16:53] And it's Jesus Christ among his people
[1:16:55] today doing the things that he promised
[1:16:58] he would do in these in this age. It's
[1:17:00] Jesus Christ. But we look at these types
[1:17:03] and shadows and we see women as well.
[1:17:05] And I'm saying that to give us
[1:17:06] encouragement this morning because too
[1:17:08] often we dwell on the men. But the bride
[1:17:10] is a woman. Amen. The bride is a female.
[1:17:13] And we see wonderful women like Hannah
[1:17:15] who sought God and prayed and she didn't
[1:17:18] let go until she got what she was
[1:17:20] seeking. But you catch what made her get
[1:17:22] what she wanted. Church was she put God
[1:17:25] first and her need second. She finally
[1:17:29] said what God wanted her to say. And
[1:17:30] that's when God gave her what she
[1:17:32] needed. Amen. She put her blessing into
[1:17:34] God's hand. Not just her complaint and
[1:17:37] her petition and her pain, but she said,
[1:17:39] 'Lord, I'll give you the blessing as
[1:17:40] well. And that's when God said, "You'll
[1:17:42] have a son. You'll put him back into my
[1:17:44] service." And after that, she had a
[1:17:45] bunch of kids. Couldn't stop popping
[1:17:47] them out. Why? Because she put God
[1:17:49] first. We see Sarah spoken of in Hebrews
[1:17:51] 11 as a woman of great faith. She has a
[1:17:54] promised child at the age of 90. Having
[1:17:56] received a body change, a body change so
[1:18:00] that she could have the word promise. So
[1:18:02] she could have a child. And she didn't
[1:18:03] just get a body changed to her. She got
[1:18:05] a body upgrade. Because remember, she
[1:18:07] couldn't have kids no matter what. In
[1:18:09] her youth, her body was messed up. She
[1:18:11] couldn't have any kids, so she got a
[1:18:13] body change and everything was fixed.
[1:18:15] Amen. God made all things right when he
[1:18:17] gave her a new body, church. God made
[1:18:19] all things right. And yes, she tried to
[1:18:21] sway and manipulate things and produce
[1:18:23] the promise of God, but she was still a
[1:18:26] woman of faith.
[1:18:28] Still a woman of faith. We see Esther.
[1:18:30] She's living outside of Israel. She's a
[1:18:32] captive in the land of Persia, and she's
[1:18:34] living below her natural privileges. But
[1:18:36] yet in that condition, God uses her to
[1:18:39] save her people from destruction.
[1:18:41] Right? What did she do? Remember what
[1:18:43] she did? She laid her life on the line.
[1:18:46] She surrendered herself to her purpose.
[1:18:49] And in her time of need, catch this. In
[1:18:52] her time of need, she still prioritized
[1:18:54] the king over herself.
[1:18:57] Now, what she did was she invited him to
[1:18:58] a banquet. And he says, "Hey, you can
[1:19:00] have whatever you want up to half my
[1:19:01] kingdom." She says, "What I want is more
[1:19:03] time with you."
[1:19:06] Church, too often we're trying to get to
[1:19:07] our need instead of our bridegroom.
[1:19:10] Amen.
[1:19:12] When we worship and praise, that's our
[1:19:14] way of giving back to him.
[1:19:16] When we come here and listen to him,
[1:19:18] that's our way of giving back to him.
[1:19:20] It's not just our tithe. It's not just
[1:19:22] our time, but it's our attention.
[1:19:25] Sisters, back me up. There are times
[1:19:26] where you're talking to your husband and
[1:19:28] he's not listening.
[1:19:30] Isn't that right?
[1:19:32] Well, guess what? Sometimes our
[1:19:33] bridegroom's trying to speak and we're
[1:19:35] not listening. We're too busy with
[1:19:36] everything else. He wants our time more
[1:19:39] than anything else, church. He wants our
[1:19:41] life. He wants our soul. He wants to
[1:19:42] connect with us. Amen. And so Esther put
[1:19:45] her king first. She put her bridegroom
[1:19:47] first. And it was only when he was fully
[1:19:50] satisfied that she made her petition
[1:19:52] known. And he gave her exactly what she
[1:19:54] wanted. Amen. You're saying, "God, give
[1:19:56] me what I need. Why don't you try some
[1:19:59] worship and praise first?
[1:20:01] give him something before you say, "Give
[1:20:04] me what I want."
[1:20:06] We see Mary, a virgin, a young woman,
[1:20:08] dedicated, sanctified in her life. And
[1:20:11] then God comes to her and he puts her as
[1:20:13] the fulfillment of scripture that a
[1:20:15] virgin shall conceive. And she says,
[1:20:16] "How's that going to happen? I've never
[1:20:18] been with a man. It's impossible for me
[1:20:19] to conceive." And God says, "Listen,
[1:20:21] don't worry about it.
[1:20:24] You're not going to have anything to do
[1:20:25] with it, but I'm just telling you,
[1:20:26] you're chosen."
[1:20:29] Mary was chosen. And he says, "Mary, you
[1:20:31] won't feel it. You won't know it's
[1:20:33] happened until afterwards.
[1:20:36] But listen, I'm going to take care of
[1:20:37] all the details. All I'm letting you
[1:20:39] know is you're going to be the one that
[1:20:40] fulfills it." And what did she say? "Be
[1:20:42] it unto me according to thy word." And
[1:20:45] she moved on. And pretty soon her belly
[1:20:47] started to come out a bit and she
[1:20:48] realized, "Hey, it happened." And
[1:20:50] church, Mary's the only one that knew
[1:20:52] she'd never been with a man. Everyone
[1:20:54] else could say, "Oh, no, no, come on
[1:20:55] now. We all know what happened there."
[1:20:58] But Mary knew. I've never been with a
[1:20:59] man. She knew what had happened. Church,
[1:21:04] I'm not here to vindicate your
[1:21:05] experience. You know what's happened.
[1:21:08] You know what's happened. But I'll tell
[1:21:10] you this. If there isn't a change after
[1:21:12] it happens, nothing happened. Amen.
[1:21:16] We see Rahab and Ruth, and they were
[1:21:19] gentile women seemingly bound by
[1:21:21] circumstances that wouldn't even give
[1:21:23] them the opportunity to receive the
[1:21:24] word. Look at Ruth. She's outside of
[1:21:26] Israel. She's over in Moab.
[1:21:28] a mixed race, messed up, imbred,
[1:21:33] sunken in sin, idolatry, child
[1:21:35] sacrifice. That's what Ruth was bound up
[1:21:37] in. Church, child sacrifice. They
[1:21:39] worship Moolik. They would pass their
[1:21:41] children through the fire. Child
[1:21:43] sacrifice. But yet, the word came to
[1:21:45] them, church. God's going to find you
[1:21:47] wherever you are. The word came to them
[1:21:50] and they came as an expression of
[1:21:52] Christ's faithful bride to the word.
[1:21:55] They cannot deny who they are.
[1:21:58] They can't explain it. I imagine on that
[1:22:00] day when we get to talk to Ruth and
[1:22:01] Rahab, they're not going to be able to
[1:22:03] tell us why they did what they did. It's
[1:22:04] just that they couldn't stop from doing
[1:22:06] it. There's something within them. Amen.
[1:22:08] See, church, we've got to stop seeing
[1:22:10] Christ as a man and see him as the word.
[1:22:13] Cuz otherwise, our sisters are going to
[1:22:14] think they don't have a part with it.
[1:22:15] Our kids are going to think they don't
[1:22:16] have a part with it. People that are
[1:22:18] broken, people that are failed, people
[1:22:19] that are mired in the muck of this world
[1:22:21] are going to think, "Well, I can't be
[1:22:22] Christ. I can't have Christ inside of
[1:22:23] me." Church, those are the ones he's
[1:22:25] coming to. Jesus said, "I came to save
[1:22:28] the lost."
[1:22:29] Only the sick need a physician. That's
[1:22:31] why I'm here. Amen. Broken people need
[1:22:34] to see that their brokenness doesn't
[1:22:36] stop God. Their isolation won't stop
[1:22:38] God. He's going to call and he's going
[1:22:40] to pull and he's going to reveal until
[1:22:42] you can't stay there anymore. Amen.
[1:22:45] People put these things so often on
[1:22:47] ministers and leaders, and that's what
[1:22:48] got Israel in the mess in the first
[1:22:50] place was they abdicated their
[1:22:51] experience with God to the people in
[1:22:53] charge.
[1:22:55] God's looking for a personal
[1:22:56] relationship for every single one of his
[1:22:59] people. Amen. Christ wasn't revealing,
[1:23:02] and this is my point in all this, Christ
[1:23:04] was not revealing himself in all perfect
[1:23:06] people. Even the most perfect had
[1:23:09] issues.
[1:23:11] Solomon was a womanizer.
[1:23:13] David was an adulterer and a murderer.
[1:23:17] Moses lost his temper.
[1:23:20] Rahab was a
[1:23:22] Ruth was a child sacrificer.
[1:23:25] Amen. The only common denominator
[1:23:28] between all of them is that when the
[1:23:30] word came, they accepted it. That's it.
[1:23:32] That's the only thing. Amen. Otherwise,
[1:23:34] they were as different as different
[1:23:36] could be. We look at all those things.
[1:23:38] We look at the men and we think, well,
[1:23:40] that's Christ being expressed in in the
[1:23:41] men. But no, before they're men, they're
[1:23:43] humans. Amen. They're a part of this
[1:23:45] flesh. They're a part of a species. And
[1:23:47] that was what was being hidden all along
[1:23:49] was Christ in people, a person, a body
[1:23:52] of flesh. And so many focused on that
[1:23:54] male portion on that second Adam on the
[1:23:56] Messiah. But as Adam came forth and then
[1:23:59] a woman later, so as after Christ came
[1:24:01] forth, there had to come a woman that
[1:24:03] came later. And that's what so many
[1:24:05] people have missed
[1:24:06] is they're tied to Christ 2,000 years
[1:24:08] ago and they don't see him in his people
[1:24:10] today. That's what they're missing out
[1:24:12] on. Everything pointed to the Messiah.
[1:24:15] Amen. and everything pointed to the
[1:24:17] Messiah. But once the Messiah was
[1:24:18] fulfilled, something else has to happen.
[1:24:20] And Paul says, "That's the mystery I'm
[1:24:22] talking to you about." And once the
[1:24:23] Messiah has come, once the atonement's
[1:24:25] been made, there's something else that
[1:24:27] has to benefit from that atonement. And
[1:24:29] it's a mystery that's been hidden. Amen.
[1:24:31] It's the bride of Christ, the elect, the
[1:24:33] chosen, the people that cannot be
[1:24:35] removed. That's who he's talking about.
[1:24:37] They might be filthy. They might be
[1:24:40] broken. They might not look like the
[1:24:42] bride of Christ, but that doesn't
[1:24:43] matter. What matters is is their name
[1:24:45] written on the lamb's book of life. And
[1:24:47] if they are, that's what's going to take
[1:24:48] it. Amen. That's what Paul's saying, I'm
[1:24:51] preaching to you today. I'm preaching
[1:24:52] about a gospel for you, in you that'll
[1:24:55] produce the word, that'll produce Christ
[1:24:57] all over again because it's been spoken
[1:24:59] about you from before the foundation of
[1:25:01] the world. Everything was pointing to
[1:25:03] that Messiah. And then Paul said the
[1:25:05] Messiah was just making a way for you to
[1:25:07] come back to your portion. That's what
[1:25:09] this whole thing's about. So on the day
[1:25:11] of Pentecost, the message wasn't just
[1:25:13] Jesus Christ is the son of God and
[1:25:16] believe on his name and be baptized, but
[1:25:17] there was a word that had to be
[1:25:19] fulfilled. And Peter says, listen, this
[1:25:21] is Joel 2:28. It's Ezekiel 36. This is
[1:25:25] what's happening now that the Messiah
[1:25:27] has come. There's something for you. And
[1:25:29] it's a word that has to be fulfilled.
[1:25:32] Just as Adam was followed by his wife,
[1:25:34] so Christ is followed by his. Amen.
[1:25:36] Remember the Bible is a book of one
[1:25:38] thing, redemption. Redemption. So Christ
[1:25:42] is the one that does the work. We are
[1:25:45] the benefactor. So when he's done his
[1:25:47] work, what it has to follow is the
[1:25:48] benefactor gets her benefits. Amen.
[1:25:54] He says, which none of the princes of
[1:25:56] this world knew. Nobody knew this
[1:25:59] mystery. Nobody knew what was going on.
[1:26:01] They couldn't see the picture. He says,
[1:26:02] for how they had they known it, known
[1:26:04] what? Had they known the mystery? Had
[1:26:06] they known what was going to happen, he
[1:26:08] says they would not have crucified the
[1:26:09] Lord of glory. Why? Because with the
[1:26:12] death and burial of Christ and then his
[1:26:13] resurrection, he settled our sin debt by
[1:26:16] way of a blood atonement and it opened
[1:26:18] up the door for the bride to come forth.
[1:26:21] The opening of his side was the bride
[1:26:24] coming out on Calvary. Amen. It's Christ
[1:26:26] in you. He had to die. He had to rise
[1:26:28] again, come back in the form of the Holy
[1:26:30] Spirit. And that could only happen once
[1:26:31] atonement was made for sin. If Satan
[1:26:34] knew what that atonement was, he'd have
[1:26:35] never had him killed.
[1:26:38] But he didn't know. All he knew was
[1:26:40] death is the ultimate answer.
[1:26:43] But he hadn't read his word. Amen. So
[1:26:46] the filth had to be cleansed from Zion
[1:26:48] as we read last sermon. And the blood
[1:26:50] does it. And then now the spirit comes
[1:26:52] to quicken her to life and put us back
[1:26:53] in our original position. Listen to
[1:26:56] this. He says, "You believe God is in
[1:26:57] his son. God is in his universe. God is
[1:27:00] in his word." He says, "Now is God and
[1:27:02] his people. What the death of Christ was
[1:27:04] for was to sanctify a church that he
[1:27:07] might work through to continue his
[1:27:09] work." There had to be an atonement made
[1:27:11] and his body, the man Jesus, was made a
[1:27:14] sacrifice willingly and submitted
[1:27:16] himself to death. So once the law and
[1:27:18] the prophets was fulfilled, because
[1:27:20] remember the law and the prophets
[1:27:21] pointed to Christ, everything was
[1:27:23] pointing to him. But hidden in there was
[1:27:24] the bride. They just weren't looking at
[1:27:26] it because what they needed was the
[1:27:27] Messiah. They needed the atonement.
[1:27:29] Amen. But there was a further
[1:27:31] fulfillment that had to happen and that
[1:27:32] was the mystery of revealing the chosen
[1:27:34] bride, the elect lady. Amen. And it came
[1:27:37] on the day when they poured out the
[1:27:38] spirit of God on those people. That's
[1:27:40] how they knew. Amen. That it was the
[1:27:42] process of letting her know who and what
[1:27:44] she is. And that's what Paul's message
[1:27:46] is about. Christ came to redeem a bride.
[1:27:49] And once that price was paid, the switch
[1:27:51] for redemption gets flipped. And now
[1:27:53] we're in a redemption process, not an
[1:27:55] atonement process. The atonement's done.
[1:27:57] It's finished. Amen. Now the focus is on
[1:28:00] who is being redeemed. That's what it's
[1:28:03] all about. That's the mystery revealing.
[1:28:05] Who is she? Who is this redeemed bride?
[1:28:07] Who's this perfect, spotless, holy,
[1:28:09] blameless bride? What does she look
[1:28:11] like? Now remember, church, a mystery is
[1:28:13] not obvious.
[1:28:15] A mystery has twists and turns.
[1:28:18] You don't see it by just looking at the
[1:28:21] things around you with the mind that
[1:28:22] everyone else does. Amen. It has twists
[1:28:24] and turns. It takes you by surprise.
[1:28:25] Things have to unravel in a mystery. You
[1:28:28] don't solve a mystery by looking at the
[1:28:29] obvious.
[1:28:31] So this mystery revealing of the bride
[1:28:33] isn't going to be the obvious people.
[1:28:35] That's not the way it works. Listen,
[1:28:37] Paul would go to the Corinthians. He
[1:28:39] say, "Listen, you were fornicators. You
[1:28:41] were adulterers. You were homosexuals.
[1:28:42] You were drunks. You were party animals.
[1:28:45] You were liars. You were thieves.
[1:28:48] That's what you were born as. But my
[1:28:52] message came to you and it caught a hold
[1:28:55] of something deep inside you. and you
[1:28:57] realize that's not what I was born to
[1:28:59] be. But before I was born, I was spoken
[1:29:02] into existence and I he says my message
[1:29:05] came and you used to be that, but it's
[1:29:07] cleaned you up and it showed you who you
[1:29:08] really are. See, the mystery wasn't
[1:29:10] obvious. We wouldn't go out today and
[1:29:13] say a homosexual is the chosen bride of
[1:29:15] Christ. But guess what? In the
[1:29:16] Corinthian church, there were. But guess
[1:29:18] what? When they came to him, they
[1:29:19] weren't homosexuals anymore. He cleaned
[1:29:22] them up. He cleaned the filth out of
[1:29:23] their life. He took the desires of their
[1:29:25] heart and he changed them into his heart
[1:29:27] and his spirit and put his word and made
[1:29:29] a desire for his word to live there.
[1:29:31] Amen. What was it? Paul's message came
[1:29:34] and it let those people say they were
[1:29:35] never really that. That was just the
[1:29:37] shell that covered the seed. But inside
[1:29:40] was something different. And he says,
[1:29:41] "You are the mystery hidden, revealed
[1:29:43] now, and now you're our epistle seen and
[1:29:45] read of all men."
[1:29:48] No one would have picked the Corinthians
[1:29:50] as the bride of Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:29:54] Listen, some of us are resting a little
[1:29:57] too much on the fact that we were raised
[1:29:58] in a Christian home, born into a family
[1:30:00] that served God faithfully, church, that
[1:30:02] has nothing to do with it. That's the
[1:30:04] grace of God. But we can look around the
[1:30:06] Bible and I've read examples today of
[1:30:08] people that were so far outside of the
[1:30:10] economy of God and yet they were a part
[1:30:12] of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:14] Hallelujah. Amen. They were lost. They
[1:30:16] were messed up. Those people wouldn't
[1:30:18] have picked themselves to be the bride
[1:30:19] of Christ,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; much less anybody looking on from the
[1:30:22] outside. But then Paul would go to the
[1:30:24] house of Cornelius, a gentile. Yes, he's
[1:30:27] a convert, but him and his household
[1:30:28] would hear the word. And while they're
[1:30:30] hearing the word, they receive it and
[1:30:31] they get the Holy Ghost right then and
[1:30:32] there. Meanwhile, Peter's back preaching
[1:30:35] in Jerusalem, and he's got a bunch of
[1:30:37] devout Jews. Now, those are the ones
[1:30:39] we'd pick, the churchgoers, the ones
[1:30:41] that lived a good, clean life, that were
[1:30:43] sanctified, never made a mistake in
[1:30:44] their life, so-called. That's the ones
[1:30:47] we pick. But when we look at the
[1:30:48] choosing of God, that's not the way it
[1:30:50] works. He's got them all spread all over
[1:30:53] the place. Amen. But one thing happens
[1:30:55] and that's when the word comes their
[1:30:56] way. It moves them into the revelation
[1:30:58] of God of who they are and they see
[1:31:00] themselves in a completely new light.
[1:31:01] They couldn't help it. As David said,
[1:31:03] the deep calls to the deep and the deep
[1:31:05] will respond to the deep. They finally
[1:31:07] caught a glimpse of who they were. And
[1:31:09] it so attracted them. It so drew them
[1:31:11] that they took that first step and a
[1:31:13] second step and a third step and pretty
[1:31:14] soon they're walking steadily towards
[1:31:16] eternity. Amen.
[1:31:18] What is it? Peter and Paul were
[1:31:20] unlocking the mystery of the bride of
[1:31:22] Christ. That's what they were doing. He
[1:31:26] says, "Any son is the attributes of his
[1:31:28] father. And just as you were in the
[1:31:29] genes of your father, in the body of
[1:31:31] your father when he was a young boy, you
[1:31:33] were in him. Yet he could not have
[1:31:34] fellowship with you because he didn't
[1:31:36] know you. But then through the bedding
[1:31:38] grounds of a mother, you were brought
[1:31:39] forth into the earth and became the
[1:31:41] image of your father. And then he could
[1:31:43] fellowship with you. He says, "And so
[1:31:46] were you, sons of God and daughters of
[1:31:48] God before there was even a moon, stars,
[1:31:50] or a molecule. You were sons and
[1:31:52] daughters of God. For you are only the
[1:31:55] physical manifestation of the attributes
[1:31:58] that were in God at the beginning. For
[1:32:00] there's only one form of eternal life,
[1:32:02] and that was you before."
[1:32:05] He says, "You don't know anything about
[1:32:07] it. Neither did you know when you were
[1:32:09] in your earthly father, but you are
[1:32:11] manifested in his image. In the image of
[1:32:14] God, you are made and you are manifested
[1:32:16] for the glory and the fellowship of
[1:32:18] God." See, what that happens when that
[1:32:21] word comes that way is it flips a switch
[1:32:23] and you say, "I'm a child of God. I did
[1:32:25] not know I was a child of God. I did not
[1:32:27] act like I was a child of God,
[1:32:30] but I'm a child of God." And everything
[1:32:32] changes once that reality comes. How do
[1:32:35] my sons know they're my sons?
[1:32:37] They have fellowship with me. No one
[1:32:40] else has fellowship with me like my
[1:32:41] family does. Amen.
[1:32:44] Listen, I like Jeremiah and I like Gabe
[1:32:46] and I like Levi, but they're still not
[1:32:48] my sons cuz they come out of me. They
[1:32:51] come out of me.
[1:32:54] The hilarious thing is when you look at
[1:32:55] my boys, they don't really look like me.
[1:32:58] But the attributes are there. The
[1:33:00] attributes are there. I can see myself
[1:33:02] in in Jensen. I can see myself in Samuel
[1:33:05] minimally and I can see a lot of myself
[1:33:07] in Jonathan.
[1:33:09] But see, we don't go by the outside. We
[1:33:11] go by the attributes.
[1:33:14] This outside flesh is just a skin. It's
[1:33:15] just a covering. It's going to die. It's
[1:33:18] going to rot away. It's going to be
[1:33:19] changed. We don't look at that. But
[1:33:20] there's something on the inside, and
[1:33:22] that's what God's coming for. He says,
[1:33:24] "And therefore, as sure as your gene had
[1:33:26] to be in your father before your natural
[1:33:28] birth, your spiritual gene had to be in
[1:33:30] God because you are an expression of the
[1:33:33] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:33:35] foundation of the world." He says
[1:33:37] there's no way around it. That's right.
[1:33:38] He says, "Now, we notice that life being
[1:33:40] in you, God's life being in you from the
[1:33:43] foundation of the world." Why am I
[1:33:45] saying this? I'm saying this to say
[1:33:47] this. It doesn't matter where you come
[1:33:49] from in this earth.
[1:33:52] It doesn't matter how much you've messed
[1:33:54] up your life or how clean your life is.
[1:33:56] Doesn't matter who your mommy and daddy
[1:33:58] were. Doesn't matter if you know who
[1:34:00] your mommy and daddy were. It matters
[1:34:02] not. What matters is is your name on the
[1:34:04] lamb's book of life because you were in
[1:34:06] the thoughts of God before the
[1:34:07] foundation of the world. That's all that
[1:34:09] matters here today. Amen. And if your
[1:34:11] name is written, church, get ready
[1:34:13] because there's a message here to get
[1:34:14] you ready for a resurrection and a
[1:34:15] rapture. That's what Paul's message came
[1:34:17] to do. To fulfill it, to get us into it.
[1:34:20] Amen. But I want you to notice something
[1:34:23] as we start to close this morning. When
[1:34:25] the true believer receives the word,
[1:34:28] what does that do to them?
[1:34:31] What happens when the word comes to the
[1:34:33] believer?
[1:34:34] It always elevates their thinking. It
[1:34:39] always elevates what they're looking at.
[1:34:41] It elevates them to where the word is
[1:34:44] rather than holding them down to where
[1:34:46] they are. The word meets them where they
[1:34:47] are, but the word doesn't leave them
[1:34:50] where they are. Amen. Rahab didn't lower
[1:34:52] the standard of the word and say,
[1:34:53] "Listen, obviously I'm a child of God
[1:34:55] because I believe the word, but you know
[1:34:57] what? This prostitution gig is working
[1:34:59] really well for me. I'm making 300 grand
[1:35:01] a year. God knows he understands my
[1:35:04] heart and I'm going to stay as a
[1:35:06] prostitute." He never said, she never
[1:35:08] said that. Why? Because the word comes
[1:35:11] to elevate us into what the word is
[1:35:14] rather into what we are in our nature
[1:35:16] and in our flesh. Amen. That's not the
[1:35:18] fulfillment of the word. The word is
[1:35:20] here to redeem us, to restore us. And
[1:35:22] that means it cannot leave us in the
[1:35:25] condition that it finds us. It's
[1:35:26] impossible. It's impossible. You cannot
[1:35:28] accept the word. You cannot accept
[1:35:30] Christ into your heart. You cannot
[1:35:31] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:33] and stay the same. It's impossible. It's
[1:35:36] impossible. The fulfillment of a word is
[1:35:38] a changing process. It's a cleaning
[1:35:40] process. It's a separating process. And
[1:35:43] when a believer catches a glimpse of
[1:35:44] what and who they are, they can't let it
[1:35:46] go. It's like a dog on a bone. They just
[1:35:49] can't let go of it. Amen. Listen, the
[1:35:51] word doesn't find you perfect. Word
[1:35:54] didn't find me. Anyone here? Were they
[1:35:55] perfect? No. Okay, you're I thought Va
[1:35:58] was saying he was perfect when the word
[1:35:59] found him there, but it was a confession
[1:36:00] of in of imperfection. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:04] Otherwise, I was going to need to see
[1:36:05] him in my office after church.
[1:36:08] The word doesn't find us perfect. You
[1:36:11] know what it defines us? Willing. That's
[1:36:13] it. Just willing. Just willing to let
[1:36:16] the washing of the water of the word do
[1:36:18] its job. Willing to let go. Willing to
[1:36:21] separate. Willing to lay it down. Amen.
[1:36:24] You're open to it. You're not clinging
[1:36:25] to what you have because what you've
[1:36:27] seen is so much greater than that. Paul
[1:36:29] would say it this way. He says, "But we,
[1:36:34] some of us, no, no, no." He says, "We
[1:36:36] all
[1:36:38] we all with open face."
[1:36:42] In other words, we're not hiding
[1:36:44] anything.
[1:36:45] We're looking clearly at the mirror. He
[1:36:47] says, "Beholding as in a glass, as a
[1:36:50] mirror, the glory of the Lord are,
[1:36:54] coddled,
[1:36:56] affirmed, patted on the back,
[1:37:00] loved."
[1:37:03] No, are changed. We are changed into the
[1:37:07] same image. What do we have today,
[1:37:10] church? We have people changing God into
[1:37:12] them. And it's nasty.
[1:37:16] There's no power in it. There's no
[1:37:17] freedom in it because they want to make
[1:37:19] God like them.
[1:37:22] They've become God. He says they are
[1:37:25] changed into the same image. We're all
[1:37:28] going to look the same
[1:37:30] in character, in nature, in spirit, in
[1:37:34] attitude
[1:37:36] are changed into the same image from
[1:37:38] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[1:37:42] God. You know if someone's received the
[1:37:44] word, how do you know they're changing
[1:37:47] into the word? That's the only answer.
[1:37:49] It's the only answer they brother Paul
[1:37:52] Fontain sings that you sing that song.
[1:37:53] You're looking more and more like your
[1:37:54] father every day. You probably don't
[1:37:57] remember that. That's probably a
[1:37:57] 20-year-old song, 25y old song. That's
[1:38:00] what we ought to be seeing, church. I'm
[1:38:02] looking more and more like him.
[1:38:04] I'm not staying the same and I'm
[1:38:07] definitely not going back. I'm changing
[1:38:10] from glory to glory. What did Paul say
[1:38:13] was this mystery was for our glory
[1:38:18] changing from glory from glory from
[1:38:20] revealing of the word revealing of the
[1:38:22] word in you Christ in you the hope of
[1:38:24] glory amen
[1:38:26] why is it why are we changed because the
[1:38:28] purpose of the word is to change three
[1:38:30] things your condition
[1:38:32] amen we're not bound to this flesh
[1:38:34] you'll never be the same again it's to
[1:38:36] change our position
[1:38:38] amen you're a child of God not a child
[1:38:39] of hell and the third thing is it's to
[1:38:41] bring us into our inheritance or our
[1:38:43] birthright that you got something that's
[1:38:45] way better than what this world is
[1:38:47] offering you. Amen. Your eyes are raised
[1:38:48] to a new plane of living. Amen. It
[1:38:50] brings you back to your original
[1:38:52] condition, authority, and relationship
[1:38:54] with God. And in that condition, in this
[1:38:56] process, the believer will do whatever
[1:38:58] it takes.
[1:39:00] We'll do whatever it takes. We'll lay
[1:39:01] anything down. We'll separate from
[1:39:04] whatever is required. Look at Abraham.
[1:39:06] Abraham is wellestablished, church. And
[1:39:09] God comes down. and he says, "Leave."
[1:39:12] Abraham left everything.
[1:39:15] But you notice he didn't leave
[1:39:16] everything. He took a few things he
[1:39:18] wasn't supposed to bring.
[1:39:20] But when he finally separated from it
[1:39:22] all, that's when he got what God told
[1:39:25] him about. But for 25 years, sisters,
[1:39:28] they lived in tents.
[1:39:31] Lived in dust and wind and rain, noise,
[1:39:35] no permanence, no stability, no roots.
[1:39:39] There's no dusting out a tent.
[1:39:42] Got to pick up and move constantly. For
[1:39:44] 25 years, he separated himself. And then
[1:39:47] he got the promise. Amen.
[1:39:50] Ruth walked away from her culture, from
[1:39:54] her old religion, from her entire
[1:39:57] family, and she went to a place where
[1:39:59] she would be rejected by most people.
[1:40:02] Why? She received the word. Amen. Paul
[1:40:06] turned his back on his old church, his
[1:40:09] old buddies, his old ministry group, and
[1:40:13] he believed something that was called
[1:40:14] heresy.
[1:40:16] Why? Something in him wouldn't let it
[1:40:18] go. He couldn't help it. Amen.
[1:40:21] Why? Because there's a change that comes
[1:40:23] with the word. And that word comes with
[1:40:25] power to give you overcoming over the
[1:40:27] things that are holding us back in life.
[1:40:29] It's revealing our eternal position,
[1:40:30] church. That's what it's doing.
[1:40:32] Revealing our eternal position, not our
[1:40:33] fleshly condition. And it's not here to
[1:40:35] affirm what this flesh is. It's here to
[1:40:37] confirm our eternal condition and
[1:40:38] position with Christ. Amen. And that
[1:40:40] bride is found faithful. She's found
[1:40:43] faithful. She walks according to the
[1:40:46] word. We see it in every in Hebrews 11.
[1:40:48] Every person in there, it says by faith.
[1:40:51] By faith. Without faith, it's impossible
[1:40:53] to please God. That means we've got to
[1:40:56] be able to do things that are uncertain,
[1:40:59] illogical, and even painful because
[1:41:02] growth is not easy. Growth does not come
[1:41:04] without pain. All of us probably have
[1:41:06] gone through it at some point. Growing
[1:41:08] pains. Remember that? Where you just
[1:41:10] hurt for no good reason and you're just
[1:41:12] growing and it hurts. Your bones ache.
[1:41:15] You want to grow your muscles. There's
[1:41:17] pain, isn't there?
[1:41:20] You want to grow your mind, go to
[1:41:22] school. Is that painful, Brother
[1:41:23] Garfield?
[1:41:25] Amen. It's painful. We have limited
[1:41:29] memory and capacity up here and it's
[1:41:31] been stretched and it's being expanded
[1:41:33] and it's being full filled and then we
[1:41:35] got to dump stuff out to fit more in.
[1:41:37] Forget everything we learn to remember
[1:41:39] the stuff that they're bringing our way
[1:41:40] again. It's horrible. Growth hurts.
[1:41:44] But it's the process of the changing
[1:41:46] word.
[1:41:48] The word doesn't change. We change.
[1:41:51] That's why it's a changing word. Amen.
[1:41:53] There's just something in us that says
[1:41:54] this is truth and I'm going to walk in
[1:41:56] it. That's all we can do.
[1:41:59] Listen to this. He says, "Now, we find
[1:42:01] that this birthright meant everything to
[1:42:03] Jacob." Now, he didn't care for anything
[1:42:05] else, but that birthright, he didn't
[1:42:06] care what it cost him. If it was a mess
[1:42:08] of pottage, he was glad to give it back
[1:42:10] to Esau. He says, "So it is with any man
[1:42:12] or woman that has been ordained to
[1:42:14] eternal life, that God has called to
[1:42:16] eternal life, is willing to sell out
[1:42:19] anything, anything of the world to
[1:42:21] obtain that birthright."
[1:42:23] He says, "You can call them anything you
[1:42:25] want. You can tell them they've lost
[1:42:28] their mind, gone off of the deep end, a
[1:42:30] bunch of holy rollers. I don't care what
[1:42:32] you call them. He says they're seeking
[1:42:33] for that birthright. And that means more
[1:42:35] than anything else. He says they are
[1:42:37] after that birthright. No matter how
[1:42:39] they have to get it, they're ready to
[1:42:41] get it. Now, catch this thought. He
[1:42:45] says, "A carnal mind wants God to bring
[1:42:47] the birthright down to their level."
[1:42:51] He says, "But for me, and I believe all
[1:42:53] trueborn Christians, we meet it on God's
[1:42:56] level." That's why I say the word always
[1:42:59] elevates our thinking. It elevates our
[1:43:01] condition. It elevates our expectation.
[1:43:03] We do not drag God down into the mud. He
[1:43:06] reaches down into the mud and pulls us
[1:43:08] out. He says, "I don't care what I have
[1:43:10] to do or what I have to say or how I
[1:43:12] have to act. The only thing I want it,"
[1:43:15] he says, "That means more than my
[1:43:16] popularity. That means more than my job.
[1:43:18] Means more than my mother. means more
[1:43:20] than my wife, more than my children,
[1:43:22] more than every friend I got. He says,
[1:43:24] "Let me have that birthright. I don't
[1:43:26] care what I have to pay." I say, God,
[1:43:29] set that desire in our hearts this
[1:43:31] morning. I'll lay down anything. I'll
[1:43:33] lay down anything.
[1:43:36] I'll lay down opportunity.
[1:43:39] I'll lay down friendships. I'll lay down
[1:43:42] what I thought was solid. I'll lay down
[1:43:45] my right to complain.
[1:43:47] I'll lay down my pain.
[1:43:50] I'll lay down my hurts and offenses.
[1:43:52] There are people that refuse to go to
[1:43:54] church because of pains and offenses.
[1:43:56] They won't lay it down for the sake of
[1:43:59] getting their birthright. What a
[1:44:01] horrible place to find ourselves. Too
[1:44:03] many times we're limiting God because
[1:44:05] we're saying, "God, I want you to bring
[1:44:06] it according to my understanding, my
[1:44:08] doctrine, my virtues, my values,
[1:44:12] my thinking, my feelings. I want you to
[1:44:16] make it easy. I want you to make it my
[1:44:18] way. because my way is the easy way.
[1:44:20] That's really what we're saying when we
[1:44:22] do that and we limit God in what he's
[1:44:24] trying to do. Amen. The word always
[1:44:26] raises us, church. It does not lower
[1:44:28] itself to our level. It takes us by the
[1:44:30] hand that pulls us out. God's got way
[1:44:32] more for us than we could ever imagine.
[1:44:34] What he has is way better than those
[1:44:36] things that we're holding on to so
[1:44:38] dearly in our life. Amen. It doesn't
[1:44:39] look as good up front and it certainly
[1:44:41] isn't comfortable. Certainly isn't
[1:44:43] comfortable, but it lasts.
[1:44:47] It's eternal.
[1:44:49] And in the long run, you'll be glad you
[1:44:51] did the right thing according to his
[1:44:53] way, not your own way. Paul would say
[1:44:56] this as we're winding down. He says,
[1:44:57] "For as it is written, I had not seen
[1:45:00] nor ear heard, neither has entered into
[1:45:02] the heart of man the things which God
[1:45:04] hath prepared for them that love him."
[1:45:07] Church, in other words, it's a mystery
[1:45:08] to our natural thinking. How good we've
[1:45:10] got it.
[1:45:12] He says, "But God hath revealed them
[1:45:14] unto us by his spirit." The natural
[1:45:16] people don't get it. Why do you do that?
[1:45:19] Why do you give your time? Why do you
[1:45:20] give your money? Why do you give your
[1:45:21] energy? Why do you give up this and give
[1:45:23] up that? And why won't you do this and
[1:45:24] why don't you do that? You're missing so
[1:45:25] much. But what God has revealed unto us
[1:45:28] by his spirit the greater things that he
[1:45:30] has for us. And it's raised our values.
[1:45:32] It's raised our estimation of what we
[1:45:34] want to have in our life. And so we
[1:45:37] don't look at those things. I was never
[1:45:39] a drinker, but I don't think I'm missing
[1:45:41] out on much judging by the drinkers that
[1:45:43] I do know.
[1:45:45] Partying, fornicating, it's gotten
[1:45:46] nobody anywhere good.
[1:45:49] Fun for a moment.
[1:45:52] Sew in a day and reap for a lifetime.
[1:45:54] It's horrible. He says, "For the spirit
[1:45:57] searches all things, yay, the deep
[1:45:59] things of God." God has revealed it to
[1:46:00] us by a spirit. Paul's preaching to the
[1:46:02] Corinthians. He says, "The spirit has
[1:46:05] revealed it." But who's doing the
[1:46:06] talking? Paul.
[1:46:08] Why? Because the spirit spoke to Paul on
[1:46:10] the back side of the desert for three
[1:46:12] and a half years. And then he came out
[1:46:13] of there and he delivered it to the
[1:46:15] people. He was the messenger to that
[1:46:16] first church age. He was the prophet of
[1:46:18] God. And when you see and read Paul's
[1:46:20] message, you see the riches of Christ.
[1:46:23] You see everything that he's offered.
[1:46:25] But church, it's never a picture that's
[1:46:27] just all rosy. It's a realistic picture.
[1:46:31] We're all going to be rejected. We're
[1:46:33] all going to be abused. We're going to
[1:46:34] be falsely accused, misunderstood,
[1:46:36] separated out. We're going to have
[1:46:39] battles.
[1:46:40] can't be victors unless we have battles.
[1:46:43] And then he never paints a rosy picture,
[1:46:45] but he paints an eternal picture. And
[1:46:48] that's what we've latched on to. Listen,
[1:46:51] consider this. Our destiny, our our
[1:46:54] victory is so assured that God has
[1:46:57] prepared things for us already.
[1:47:01] Listen, if I don't know that somebody's
[1:47:03] coming over to my house, I'm not going
[1:47:04] to prepare my house. But if I know
[1:47:06] someone's coming over, then I'm going to
[1:47:08] prepare it. And he says, "God has
[1:47:10] prepared." Why? Because there's going to
[1:47:12] be a people ready to receive it. There's
[1:47:13] going to be a victor. There's going to
[1:47:14] be an overcomer. Amen. There's a prize.
[1:47:16] There's a reward for the overcomer in
[1:47:19] the Bible. Amen. The overcoming bride.
[1:47:21] And his his reward is already waiting
[1:47:23] for her. Her final condition is
[1:47:25] guaranteed. Her victory is guaranteed.
[1:47:29] Watch this. Our last quote before we
[1:47:30] close. He says, "And finally upon the
[1:47:33] earth came the genuine image of God
[1:47:35] himself again, which was God, the logos
[1:47:38] made flesh and dwelt among us." He's
[1:47:40] speaking of Christ. He says, "Now that
[1:47:42] same logos has a part.
[1:47:46] He has got a bride." And the same logos,
[1:47:51] this word that cannot be tampered with,
[1:47:54] he said, is brooding over the churches
[1:47:57] today trying to bring back the word to
[1:48:01] its full manifestation.
[1:48:04] And we just read Paul said, "The riches
[1:48:06] are waiting for you." She's going to
[1:48:08] succeed. She's going to be there. She's
[1:48:10] going to be spotless and without
[1:48:11] wrinkles. She's going to be holy. She's
[1:48:13] going to be blameless.
[1:48:14] Why? Because the word has declared it
[1:48:16] and we're resting on it. We're resting
[1:48:19] on it. We're resting on it.
[1:48:22] But are we resting on it, church?
[1:48:25] Are we resting on it? Does our life
[1:48:27] reflect rest
[1:48:30] or disobedience?
[1:48:32] Disbelief.
[1:48:34] We trusted so far, but not all the way.
[1:48:38] Amen. We look in the book of Revelation
[1:48:41] at the very end. It says, "The spirit
[1:48:43] and the bride say, "Come." She's there.
[1:48:46] She's a new Jerusalem coming down out of
[1:48:48] heaven as a bride adorned for her
[1:48:50] husband. She's finished.
[1:48:53] It's a finished work. There's a bride
[1:48:55] that's made herself ready. Amen. Look at
[1:48:58] this. He says, "The spirit of God is
[1:48:59] brooding over the earth like it was at
[1:49:01] the beginning." Remember what the
[1:49:02] scripture says in Genesis 1 says the
[1:49:04] spirit of God was hovering over the
[1:49:05] earth. It was brooding over the earth.
[1:49:07] What for? To bring out life. The it was
[1:49:10] setting an atmosphere for life. And
[1:49:12] that's what's happening today. He's
[1:49:14] trying to bring those seeds to life. But
[1:49:17] you'll notice the sun brings every seed
[1:49:19] to life. There's lots of seeds sown.
[1:49:22] Remember the parable of the sewer. You
[1:49:24] had the son of man, the son of God
[1:49:26] sewing, and then you had an enemy
[1:49:27] sowing. And guess what? The presence of
[1:49:29] the son brings all the seeds to life.
[1:49:32] Amen. But the purpose of the son is to
[1:49:35] bring his seeds to life. And he gathers
[1:49:38] in the other ones and he puts them to
[1:49:39] one side. And then he gathers his own
[1:49:41] into the garner. And he's got a place
[1:49:43] prepared for them. I love how he says
[1:49:46] he's got a bride. This word that cannot
[1:49:49] be tampered with. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:49:51] Garfield and I were talking about this.
[1:49:54] Remember, when a woman receives a seed,
[1:49:56] her womb is closed. It cannot be
[1:50:00] tampered with. Men can abuse her. Men
[1:50:02] can take advantage of her. Men can try
[1:50:04] and make her produce life. But once she
[1:50:06] receives that life, her womb is closed
[1:50:09] and she cannot be tampered with anymore.
[1:50:12] Satan's trying to tamper with his bride,
[1:50:15] but her womb is closed to anything
[1:50:17] because the word seed has already been
[1:50:19] quickened. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless
[1:50:21] you. Let's stand this morning. I'm so
[1:50:23] glad I can't change myself.
[1:50:27] I make mistakes. I have failures. I
[1:50:29] disappoint myself. But it doesn't change
[1:50:31] who I am in his eyes. Amen. Why? Because
[1:50:33] there's a seed gene of God inside of us.
[1:50:35] And God is so confident in our victory,
[1:50:38] in our overcoming, in our final
[1:50:40] condition, that he's prepared a place
[1:50:42] for us this morning. Amen. That's what
[1:50:44] he's doing. Jesus said, "I go to prepare
[1:50:46] a place. I know you're going to make it
[1:50:49] through and I'm going to make it and
[1:50:51] it's going to be so wonderful, you'll
[1:50:52] never be able to express how great it
[1:50:54] is." Church, is his confidence in you?
[1:50:57] Is his confidence in me?
[1:51:00] No. His confidence is in the word he
[1:51:02] placed inside of us. It's the nature of
[1:51:04] a seed. It cannot be changed. And so the
[1:51:07] spirit's just here to quicken what's
[1:51:08] already inside of you. And when that
[1:51:10] burst forth, there's no changing. It's
[1:51:11] got to go all the way and reproduce
[1:51:13] itself all over again. Amen. There's
[1:51:16] nothing in me that warrants confidence.
[1:51:18] Remember said, I didn't come, Paul said,
[1:51:20] I didn't come in the wisdom of man. I'm
[1:51:22] not here in the mis wisdom of brother
[1:51:23] John this morning, but I'm in the wisdom
[1:51:25] of the power of the spirit quickened
[1:51:26] word. Amen. That we could receive that
[1:51:29] and that's where our confidence is. He
[1:51:31] called me. I'm his child. I'm gonna make
[1:51:34] it. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:51:37] you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:51:38] Father, Lord, our hearts are encouraged
[1:51:41] this morning, Lord, to see your perfect
[1:51:44] word thought,
[1:51:46] Lord, that was spoken, names were
[1:51:48] written down before the foundation of
[1:51:50] the world. Lord, a lamb was slain before
[1:51:52] the foundation of the world to make a
[1:51:54] way back for us to you, heavenly father.
[1:51:56] Lord, we're in the process of a rapture.
[1:51:58] We're in a process of redemption. And
[1:52:00] Lord, we're in a process of bringing us
[1:52:01] back to you, to our original
[1:52:03] relationship, our original condition,
[1:52:05] our original authority, heavenly father.
[1:52:08] Lord, but it's a process that develops
[1:52:09] our character, Lord. It's a process that
[1:52:12] ties us to the typost of the word, Lord.
[1:52:15] It's a process that anchors us to you,
[1:52:17] Lord, where you are in us and we are in
[1:52:19] you, Lord. I pray you help us to stay
[1:52:21] closer than ever to you, heavenly
[1:52:23] father. Lord, that our day-to-day
[1:52:25] decisions, the way we spend our time and
[1:52:27] energy, Lord, that our very thoughts,
[1:52:29] Lord, we be subject to what you say
[1:52:31] about us. Lord, may our lives, may our
[1:52:33] souls, may our minds, may our mouths be
[1:52:35] filled with your word day by day. Lord,
[1:52:37] may we meditate on it. May we feed on
[1:52:39] it, Lord, that it could produce itself
[1:52:41] inside of us again. We pray. Lord, you
[1:52:44] see each life, each heart here. Lord, I
[1:52:47] pray you draw us closer to you. Lord,
[1:52:49] grant us grace to see ourselves through
[1:52:51] your eyes, Lord, through the perfect
[1:52:52] shed blood. Lord, that just lets you see
[1:52:54] the eternal part of us, Lord, the faith
[1:52:57] part of us, Lord, and forgive us where
[1:52:59] we fall so short many times. Lord, grace
[1:53:02] to your people, Lord. We pray for Sister
[1:53:03] Melody this morning, sick at home, Lord,
[1:53:05] praying a special grace to her, heavenly
[1:53:07] father. Lord, we pray for the fire
[1:53:09] situation, Lord. We pray for these
[1:53:11] special meetings coming up, Lord, that
[1:53:13] your spirit would just have perfect rain
[1:53:14] in our lives, Lord, that we would
[1:53:16] surrender ourselves and be filled a new
[1:53:18] by you. We pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:53:21] we ask it. Amen. And amen.
[1:53:26] No longer a slave to fear. 1213
[1:53:35] 1219. Sorry.
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:48] And you have covered me.
[1:53:52] with a melody.
[1:53:56] You surround me with

[1:55:10] into your family.
[1:55:15] Your love flows through
[1:55:19] my veins.

[1:55:25] a slave
[1:55:27] to me.
[1:55:31] I am a child of God.

[1:57:48] I am a child of God.
[1:57:56] You split the sea so I could walk right
[1:58:01] to it. My fears were drowned in perfect
[1:58:06] love.
[1:58:10] You rescued me so I could stand and
[1:58:15] sing.
[1:58:17] I am a child of God.
[1:58:25] You sp the sea so I could walk right

[1:59:16] I am a child of God.
[1:59:22] He's got it all in control.
[1:59:25] 11:16
[1:59:26] He's got it all
[1:59:29] in control.
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:35] He's got it all in control.
[1:59:42] For he put that reassur
[1:59:47] way down in my soul.
[1:59:53] He's got it all in control.
[2:00:02] My father knows what I hear.
[2:00:10] My father knows what I need.
[2:00:17] In everything I go through,
[2:00:21] he knows what's best for me.
[2:00:28] My father knows what I need.
[2:00:36] And I put my life in his hand.
[2:00:44] I put my life in his hand.
[2:00:51] So that every road I walk down,
[2:00:55] I'm sure it's in his plan.
[2:01:02] I put my life in his hands.
[2:01:10] My father knows what I need.
[2:01:18] My father knows what I need.
[2:01:26] In everything I go through,
[2:01:30] he knows what's best for me.
[2:01:37] My father knows what I need.
[2:01:44] And I put my life in his hands.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; I put my life in his hand.
[2:02:00] So every road I walk down,
[2:02:04] I'm sure it's in his.
[2:02:11] I took my life in his hand.
[2:02:16] I feel the pole. 606.
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:22] At night I lay in bed
[2:02:27] and I begin
[2:02:30] to cry.
[2:02:36] And my mind just fails to know
[2:02:42] exactly
[2:02:45] why.
[2:02:49] Oh, I can't explain
[2:02:53] with God or pain
[2:02:56] the spirit moving
[2:03:00] deep within.
[2:03:03] Oh, it must be God
[2:03:07] here in my soul.
[2:03:11] I feel the home.
[2:03:17] I feel the call.
[2:03:24] I hear the call.
[2:03:31] And I know that his spirit's
[2:03:35] moving
[2:03:36] me to give my all.
[2:03:45] He speaks to me
[2:03:51] and I
[2:03:59] Lord please come and take control.
[2:04:06] I feel the
[2:04:12] Oh, I wait to hear the word
[2:04:18] and with each line
[2:04:21] and praise.
[2:04:26] Oh, he was calling
[2:04:30] me to give a higher
[2:04:36] praise.
[2:04:40] Oh, there's a king.
[2:04:44] Call to the king. It's like a great
[2:04:49] magnet
[2:04:51] pouring
[2:04:52] me.
[2:04:54] Oh, I know for sure that I'll reach the
[2:05:00] goal. For I feel the
[2:05:07] I feel the cold.
[2:05:14] I hear the call.
[2:05:21] And I know that his spirit is moving
[2:05:27] me to give my all.
[2:05:35] He speaks to me
[2:05:41] and I agree.
[2:05:49] Lord, please come and take control.
[2:05:55] I feel the cold
[2:06:02] and I went to hear the word and with
[2:06:09] each line and praise
[2:06:16] he was calling
[2:06:20] me to give a higher the praise.
[2:06:30] Oh, there's a deep
[2:06:34] call to the deep. It's like a grave
[2:06:41] holy.
[2:06:44] Oh, I know for sure that I'll reach the
[2:06:49] goal. For I feel the
[2:06:57] I feel the calling.
[2:07:04] I hear the call.
[2:07:11] And I know that is here
[2:07:18] to give my all.
[2:07:25] He speaks to me
[2:07:32] and I
[2:07:39] so Lord please come and take control.
[2:07:46] I feel the
