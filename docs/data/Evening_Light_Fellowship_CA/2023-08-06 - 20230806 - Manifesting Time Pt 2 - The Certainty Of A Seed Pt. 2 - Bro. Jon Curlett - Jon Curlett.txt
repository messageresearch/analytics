wait amen this is one of the good times to one of the better times to be a pastors the baby dedications and usually the marriages amen but were gathered here this morning to to dedicate Wesley Mark coffee to the Lord and of course as you have to you look up the names and Wesley we know is one of the greatest preachers ever lived one of the most dedicated ministers and I'm not going to be prophetic this morning but you never know what could happen with these things but certainly the word Wesley or the name Wesley means western Pastor Western Lee and brother Paul told me it also means token but it must have been buried in an ancient manuscript because I couldn't find it so I've got to only preach what I know myself and that said it's Western pasture Western Lee but you know when I read that I thought about Psalms 23. says the Lord is my shepherd shall not want he lead me besides the wires he restores my soul but he he what he puts them in Green Pastures a place of rest a place to feed a place where the shepherd's watching over but then we come to a second name which is Mark and Mark is perhaps the most bipolar of Christian names that you can get I say that in a wonderful way because it means polite it means Shining it means kind and then it means warlike and it means hammer and you know what when I look at that I think that's the way the Christian is you start out and you're kind and you're a shining light and you're polite but when it comes time for battle you bring the hammer and you give it everything you've got and you don't back down you know even Michael arguing over the body of Moses does not bring a railing accusation the scripture says against Satan he was polite to Satan but when it comes time to time to fight we don't back down amen our personality is not to back down we'll be kind as long as we we can be kind but when he's on our property we've got to fight for it amen so I believe that's what we've got here is we've got a child of God a Son of God that's gathered and he's been set in Green Pastures and Manny's God's got a place for him God's got a a position for him and he's going to be a gentleman but he's going to be a soldier for the Lord as well amen Jeremiah 29 11 says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected End Amen all right let's pray together if we would Heavenly Father Lord what a precious thing it is to bring these children before you Lord God Lord knowing our insufficiency in ourselves as parents Lord even as Believers Lord to bring them Lord into your presence Lord but we know that you've ordained Lord each one Lord you put a seed of life to see Gene of God inside of them Lord God lord and in recognition of that this morning we're committing Lord Wesley Mark coffee into your hands Lord we're committing his parents for committing his grandparents into your hands Lord that they would raise him in the admonition admonition and nurture of the Lord heavenly father that they would raise him in a home where the holy spirit is the atmosphere Lord that he would know your praise and worship Lord that he would know what it is to be around a real and living God lord and as he comes to his time of age and maturity Lord that he would just reach out to you Lord as you call and Lord that he will receive you Lord that your holy spirit will just overshadow him Lord that it would fill him Lord that it will bless him Lord abundantly we pray Lord be with brother Paul and Sister Kim Lord young Michael Lord may you just surround them Lord with a hedge of protection Lord bless and provide them day by day Lord as they dedicate their lives and their family to you therefore we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen amen let's stand if we would amen I certainly appreciate the specials this morning Mr Abby went away a little girl and came back a young woman with the voice of an Angel a man certainly appreciate it's okay musicians we won't we won't be singing Anything we'll go straight to the word yes but it's a wonderful thing to see amen turn if you would to Psalms 132. Psalms 132 men want to thank brother Paul for taking the service on Sunday with his adult Sunday school and then trusting you enjoyed it I only got to watch a bit of it but I enjoyed what I what I heard and then certainly having brother Barry here to speak to us on Wednesday I was able to hear all of that and and trust it was a blessing to you amen we certainly want to greet our visitors brother and sister Baggett here we've got brother Adam sister Jamie and family amen it's good to have each one here when I was away I I met so many people and so many brothers other ministers but brother Ed hammermeister brother Dwayne Fair brother Ron Spencer and many others asked me to pass on their greetings and their blessings to the church and say that they miss us and certainly are looking forward to the next time that they'll be here amen amen Psalms 132 and verse 13 says for the Lord had chosen Zion he had desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what a precious scripture we're reading this morning lord lord of your bride and Lord we see here Lord that we are here because you desired it Lord because you have chosen us Lord that you have declared us before the foundation of the world and Lord that's our rest this morning Lord is that you have chosen us Lord that this is a work of yours not a work of ours that this is not just our will Lord but it's your will and it's been determined Lord before the foundation of the very World Lord we're praying that you would just bless us now with the the preaching Lord and the hearing of the word Lord speaker and hearer like Lord you may you just Quicken us Lord may you just build up our faith this morning Lord may we rise to a higher Heights Lord may we come up a little higher we pray in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen and amen you can have your seats this morning God bless you it's certainly good to be back I had quite a whirlwind trip and so many different people I saw there and met many new ministers and and talk to different ones and so we've got quite a lineup coming up over the next months and years certainly Lord willing but just to get right into the preaching the the the word this morning I want to take a a second uh portion on on this thought of the certainty of a seed in this series we're doing on manifesting time and we spoke last time just as a recap for those that weren't here we spoke on the certainty of a seed is that it cannot change amen what's inside it does not change because it's environment changes because its location changes because the things around it change it never changes what's inside of a seed what it is inside is what it will always be and what it is it always will be amen it has no say in the matter and we talked about how God spoke in Genesis and he spoke to the seeds that were planted and he said bring forth of your own kind and the seeds did exactly that the principle is that God speaks and things happen amen and when it comes to seeds they produce exactly what he's put in them from the beginning but I spoke last time and I wanted to hammer it this morning this thought that those seeds could only produce life and produce what was inside of them as the conditions were right for life amen they've been sitting there for for for who knows how long you know whether you believe in a short Earth or a long Earth literal days or or whatever it might be that when the word came forth it did not produce the life when the word came forth it did not produce the life what happened when the word came forth was that it produced the conditions and then the conditions produce the life the word of God in and of itself did not bring them to life but the Word of Life set the conditions correctly for those seeds to come to life in a way that they weren't able to do before that amen God has to set the conditions we can sit here under the preaching of the word we can sit here under the hearing of the word we can sit in a message church we can have all these things but until God sets the conditions right we cannot produce what this word says we're supposed to produce and it's a time of God's choosing not a time of our choosing amen amen it took the conditions to be right for these things to come out and we can sit here and in Jesus day there were many people going on the Sabbath to hear the word and they heard it for hundreds and hundreds of years but until that Messiah showed up there were certain things that could not happen why because the conditions weren't right the timing wasn't right and it was up to God to choose those things but when God speaks that word and he says let the seeds bring forth of their own kind then it's up to him to make the conditions right it's up to him to bring out the life that's inside of them amen seeds need a prompt seeds sit in the ground and if you put a seed in and you plant it late in the in the fall it won't come to life because it's not meant to do it the temperatures are dropping and it it senses the cycle that's there but it'll lay dormant all through the winter and it'll lie in frozen ground where there's no life that can come out of it at that season but as it comes into spring and the days get longer and the Sun starts to shine and the Earth starts to warm up then something prompts the seed and it's got a trigger inside of it that when certain conditions are met it comes to life and it starts to grow and it starts to rot the outside and it starts to grow from the inside out and when the conditions match the DNA that's programmed into that seed it says it's time to come to life and then it comes to life and there's nothing can stop it from doing that amen you can put a seed in a cold place you can put a seed in a dry place and it will never come to life but that doesn't mean there's no life in it it just means that it can't come to life in those conditions you know it needs certain things to come to life it needs dirt it needs moisture it needs sunlight it actually needs a cycle in temperature it can't be hot all the time it needs to be cool at times and hotter times it needs ups and downs if we want to put it that way it needs the conditions to just be right and you know I was studying a long time ago on a certain thing and I don't think I ever brought it to the church but that back in in Jesus day Judean dates from Israel were prized around the world for their taste you know the scripture says it's a land flowing with milk and honey well the dates from Judean Palms tasted they had an aftertaste of honey and there was nothing like them in the rest of the world and they would ship them all over the world and they were prized for that special taste that they had but sometime somehow those dates those palm trees that produce those dates went completely extinct right and today if you were to go around the world none of those trees exist but then the archaeologists were up in the in the in the the desert Fortress of Masada and we know what that looks like and and I got a picture here we look at Masada and they found the seeds from a Judean date palm so for 2 000 years those seeds have been sitting in Masada now that's Masada up there on the left that is not a place for life that is not a place for gold palm trees don't grow in Masada but Masada is a great place to preserve sometimes we look at situations we look at people and we say they're never going to grow there sometimes God's preserving them for a place where they'll grow sometimes what's happening is God's keeping them in a place where they won't be tainted where they won't come to life and die because there's nothing there to grow with and he's preserving them for a place where they can once plant it grow completely because God doesn't do an incomplete work God doesn't start us to fail us when he starts us he's going to see us all the way through the end and sometimes he's got to put us in a place where we can't grow and then all of a sudden God will move them to a different Ministry move them to a different Church move them out of the world where they were kept safe as an atheist for so long untainted by false religion and he'll bring them into a place where the truth is preached and that person will come to life immediately because they're under the right conditions but God preserved them in a place of unbelief where nothing could touch them to bring them to a place where his perfect word could be preached and all of a sudden they come to life but they found these date palms in Masada and they found I think 32 or 33 of them and so they got special permission to try and grow one and they took it and they took it and they put it in a lab in perfect growing conditions and they planted this tree and it came to life and this is the tree now and they call it Methuselah because it's been dormant for so long but now it lives and this tree now is over six meters tall and it's a male and when they realized that they could do that then they planted and they tried a bunch of other seeds and they got six more to grow so now they have seven trees and they name them all after characters in The Bible and so what they have done now the last I looked they had 111 dates that they got from a female tree that Methuselah had pollinated so now today you can have dates that they haven't had for two thousand years because they were perfectly preserved in a dry cool place for two millennia that's the certainty of a seed it'll lay there and it'll lay there and it'll lay there and then you put it in the right conditions and all of a sudden it blossoms into life amen you know we'd look at like I said these people and and we look at where they're at sometimes and we say they've made the wrong decisions they're in the wrong place they're never going to grow and you know what usually they don't grow usually our perception on these things is right but you come to that place and God's moving and I think sometimes we forget is in all the noise God is still moving amen he's the one that secures us he's the one that calls us he's the ones that pulls us he's the ones that ordains us and so we're looking at all the noise and not realizing that in it all God is moving brother Brown would say a birth is messy he says it's always a mess and sometimes you got to get in messy conditions to have a messy birth and it's got to be very obvious and sometimes that's the security we need is an obvious birth rather than a cold formal birth just because we've been going to church all of our life or we've been sitting under the message all of our life they're supposed to be a mess that goes around these things amen but God is working even when we don't see it God is working even when we don't see it when God says something has to happen and it's a supernatural happening because everything God says is Supernatural then it's up to him to consent the conditions for his word to come to pass it's him that's going to do it it's not us why because he's responsible for his own word and I read this quote in the last service and I want to use this as an anchor point this morning brother Brian said now first place the word of God is the only plan and the only truth about God the word is God you understand I'm quoting scripture he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so the word is God and he says now then if God has said something it's up to God to take care of his own word amen so if you are a part of him I'm saying because you are a part of him it's up to him to take care of you it's up to him to produce the word that's inside of each one of us amen it's not up to you and I to bring this word to pass yes we have a part to play yes we have a mind yes we can accept yes we can make decisions yes we can choose how we spend our time and energy But ultimately it's up to him to produce the word because he's the one that thought it he's the one that spoke it he's the one that declared it and it's up to him to produce it in these things amen we aren't responsible to make it happen it's God that quickens it's God that gives life it's God that puts us in the right conditions and it's God that produces what's inside of us it's his responsibility overall brother Brown would say this he says now if we would think this morning the very Earth We're living on this morning is the word of God that tree is the word of God and you your body is the word of God God spoke it into existence like that made it from nothing which had nothing he says did you ever notice the human life where it come from one little cell so small that a human eye couldn't see it only through a great powerful glass and out of there come a 200 pound man where did it come from he says God just spoke it and it just started by Nature growing and there it produced just exactly notice why did it grow by Nature because there was something in it that was programmed for it to grow amen it's nature that God had put in it was to grow and as soon as God sets the right conditions by Nature it will grow that's why brother Branham said if you're standing still you're backsliding because your nature is to grow your nature is to keep pushing forward your nature is to keep coming higher it's to keep digging deeper so your nature is to keep pressing and when you suppress it it's because you're backslidden we don't stand still amen everything we have need of inside of us to be a son or daughter of God is already in US and all it takes is a holy spirit to Quicken it by the word and all of a sudden it starts to grow he says by Nature it started growing and there produced just exactly he says he spoke every tree everything into existence and it's such a wonderful wonderful thing this morning to view the word of God like I said we've got a part to play unlike natural seeds we've got intelligence we've got a mind we have choices that we make day in and day out but God will bend it to make it work to his plan we talked about Jonah before remember and how God used his personality that unwillingness to go somewhere to turn it into his perfect will and God will use your personality God will use who you are as we heard over this Pulpit God will use you exactly as you are to produce his word and he's going to break us he's going to bend us he's going to mold us I was I was listening to to brother Brown when he was talking about he said that that the bride is not brass that breaks under a beating but it is gold that is malleable and can be formed and shaped and it doesn't break under the shaping hand of God and the same thing amen but it's his responsibility but I want to talk about a second portion of the certainty of a scene because we've talked about how what's inside it cannot change and that's the first certainty but there's a second certainty because what I didn't tell you about those seeds that they found in Masada was only seven came to life out of 32. some of them were not preserved for the 2000 years some of them have gone too far they've been sitting too long they've been dormant too long and the life would not come out of them and so only six out of the 32 came out and so we see within the certainty of a seat we see an uncertainty and that is will it come to life at all will it come to life at all you know we look around this this this uh this congregation we look around the the people that are here and we say the numbers are stacked against us when we compare the 50 or 60 people that are here this morning you know with the 250 000 that are in the St John's area we would say this the the the numbers the odds are stacked against us that not many are going to make it because the evidence sits before us not many are sitting under the hearing of the word this morning and so we have a great uncertainty as to whether we are truly a son and daughter of God why because the numbers are stacked against us only six out of 32 made it out of those date palm seeds in Masada and we look at here and we look at ourselves and we say am I really is this really true brother Brandon would preach One in a Million I think we're greater than 1 million I think we're about one in 10 million these days because it says he has to cut the day short because otherwise no flesh should be saved we're on a we're on a Razor's Edge but I'm not here to talk to you this morning about uncertainty I'm here to talk to you about certainty but listen to this because I want you to realize what it is that you are and I want to realize you to realize how special you are this morning first first Corinthians 1 says is for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called listen if you're smart if you're educated if you have all the things that this world wants if you're sitting in this church this morning you are blessed above all because not many of those people are called most of the ones he calls the scripture says the Common People heard him gladly and more common considering ourselves against most of the world brother Brown would say this it says and he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man see where eight Souls were saved he says I don't say there's going to be eight saved now now don't get that all wrong I never said that I don't know how many are going to be saved in that that last moment to Rapture that little group it'll be a small group I'll tell you that for straight As the gate and narrow is the way but few there be that'll find it he'd go on to say this he said but all down through the age there had been a little remnant a little Remnant was holding on to the truth of God just a small group The Church of God has always been in the minority when we see big numbers now I'm not talking against big churches but when you look at a church that's got 15 000 people these mega churches then something's wrong because the word will not allow that many people it's a divider it's a separator it's a breaking down of these things so when you see the masses going to it that's your first sign that it ain't the true word of God because it's always been rejected amen but we're here to talk about certainty I'm not here to put doubt in your mind but I'm here to show you because you are here it points to the great certainty of God and the seed of life and the seed of God that's inside of you amen we spoke last service how the word is the thoughts of God expressed and God thought it and God spoke it and then he wrote it in a book and now perhaps God has many thoughts we don't know all the thoughts of God he didn't choose to give us all the thoughts of God but he chose us to give chose to give us the thoughts that pertained unto us in this little book that we have here these 66 books we have everything we need to get us out of here to get us through life to get us into a resurrection to get us into a Rapture to give us the Holy Ghost to get our family saved to live an overcoming life to live a Victorious Life To Break Down The Walls of Satan's kingdom in our lives and others everything we have need of is here he's given us the recipe he's giving us his portion of his thoughts to get us through amen scripture says that this is so clear that even though a man is a fool he won't air in it he won't error in it he won't fall away from it it doesn't take intelligence it just takes a revelation from God and you can be a fool in the eyes of the world and you can be a true son or daughter of God Amen but what I love about God is that he is consistent he is repetitive because guess what we aren't the smartest knives we're not the the smartest cookies we're not the sharpest knives in the drawer and sometimes we need to see things over and over and over again to see it and that's exactly the way God does it in his word is he does the same thing over and over and over and over so that you'll realize it's him so that you'll realize if you do what he says he'll do what he said and over and over again and you can start to see the way God moves and then you can start to enter in to the work of God rather than sitting back and letting God do all the work you can start to see what's happening and you can be a part of these things we can have faith we can have confidence that God is moving in our lives brother Brown would say this he said The Impossibles Are Made Real when God is taken at his word The Impossibles Are Made Real when God has taken at his word when any person any person he didn't put an age requirement he didn't put a gender requirement he didn't put a marriage requirement on it he said when any person will take that same word it'll bring the same results every time he says every time you ask about it when God had his thoughts and he spoke to him we showed how in the last service we were in those thoughts and therefore we were part of what was spoken and what was written we are not just it's not just an idea of God but we are literally made a part of God when he expresses himself this way amen I think we've said this before it's not just this Bible is written for us this Bible is written about us this is our book this is our book it's meant specifically for us when I was in Edmonton brother Nathan Erickson I only was able to make one of the special meetings there but he was preaching and he was speaking about Ruth and Boaz and there come a time after Ruth had gone to the threshing floor and she'd laid at the feet of Boaz and then he covered her over and he declared that yes he would redeem her and she goes home and what happened Naomi said take your rest because he will not rest until he's done what he said and then he said one of the most profound statements I've ever heard he said it was boaz's power but it was Ruth's book it was boaz's power but it was Ruth's book it was him that was doing it but it was her story it's God's power but it's our story amen he's written this book about us and we're supposed to be stepping into the pages amen the title deeb was never supposed to be out of our hands it was ours it was given to Adam and we lost it by sin and it went back to the hands of God but it did not belong to God he's given it back to us Revelations 10 8 he gives us back the book and says now you go now you eat it realize you're in it realize it's inside of you live it produce it it'll taste great it's going to be hard in your belly but you've got to produce it and you've got to prophesy again you've got to produce the word again it's not just to you it is yours you're in it it's a part of you and you're a part of it amen everything we have need is supplied there God and His Sovereign will and purpose declared that he was going to have a family that there would be a royal seed line that was coming of priests and kings that would Rule and reign with him and so he's got to produce these things and We Know It was supposed to be perfect Adam and Eve were not intended to fall in God's perfect will but yet God's seen it ordained that his Redemption plan would come and it would still produce us so God's word could not be stopped after Satan came in and messed up humanity and so we're stuck now between two Dimensions we've got a spiritual calling in the high places in Christ Jesus and yet we're stuck in this thinking flesh down here and there's a battle between those two things and it's up to God to resolve the differences and take us out of here amen brother Brown puts it this way he says and so God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we could be contacted in order that he could contact he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes in Fellowship God wanted a family God wanted to be family and fellowship is the first thing that He restored when he died on the cross was he tore that Veil so that anybody would come into could come into the presence of God brother Ram said it used to be death to come into His presence now it's death to refuse to come into His presence he is restoring us back to fellowship he said when I was in my father I knew nothing about it brother Brown says we bypassed our theophany so we have no memory of what we were but when I become his son and was born of him I was an attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father and as children of God we are a part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh don't miss that he had to come in flesh so that you could come and flesh behind him and produce the exact same word that was written about you you are no less than him except he was the full manifestation and each of us is only a partial manifestation but it's the same word the same power in this very same lost flesh exactly the same thing he said why were we made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning and then this very thought of redemption is restoring to original position of relationship the thought of redemption is that we were with him before this all began you can't redeem that which was not deemed in the first place you had to be somewhere to be redeemed back to it that's why only the true children of God can be redeemed is because only they were in his thoughts only they are a part of his word so they're the only ones that can come back you can't redeem what isn't yours there are those that will be saved that aren't redeemed and that's the grace of God that wants to preserve life but the redeemed is the bride and bride alone that's how special you are this morning church you are the elect Pride you are the redeemed of Christ this morning chosen before the foundation of the world Amen you had to be with him to be redeemed back to him you had to have eternal life to be redeemed back to eternal life you had to have relationship to come back to relationship but let's take it back to the scriptures very familiar in Revelation 17 8 it says the Beast that thou sauce was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into Perdition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they beheld the Beast that was and is not and yet is amen we're talking about the certainty of a seed and here's the second certainty we've got to have that we will come to life because not every seed has life in it it'll produce something but it'll die out or won't produce any fruit because it's not the original life it's not the Original Seed amen you've got to have a second certainty which is that of coming to life and the prophet will point to this time and time again as our certainty and he says you have eternal life because he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you're an attribute of God and here's the thing I love about God is he didn't just write there's going to be an attribute but he said there's a name attached to that attribute there's a person that's attached to that attribute there's a personality that's attract that's attached to that attribute it can't just be anyone that doesn't he doesn't just say somebody is going to produce the patience of God in laodicea but instead he writes Maureen coffee is going to produce the patience of God in laodicea then he wrote Garfield Grant is going to produce the victory of Jesus Christ and then he wrote Amber coffee is going to produce the long suffering of Jesus Christ he put a name next to the attribute he made he said there's going to be a body there's going to be a person there's going to be a nature there's going to be an expression a living expression not just happenstance not just luck but specific to you when you're sitting here this morning it's because he called you specifically not that you somehow made up your mind about this but he called you out of this Earth and he said you will live for me you are me you are a production of me and there's something for you to do inside of this life we it's not just random it's not just happen sense Church what people in this world aren't built to live this but you're built to produce the exact word for this age The Living Word is inside of you and the Holy Spirit quickens it and you do something that you could never do otherwise brother Graham said this he says so God in the beginning was life the Eternal one in him were attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh then he says Jesus was the Redeemer of what those attributes he expressed it but there was a greater there was a greater expression meaning uh more expression he says until redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back it had to be somewhere to be brought back to so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people weren't in the beginning in God's thoughts see you can talk to people and it can be as clear as clear can be and they won't get it why because there's nothing in them to receive it there is no resonance inside there isn't something inside of them there is no deep calling to the Deep that's why that's why the the scripture would say after the first or second admonition just let it go because there's nothing there to receive it now sometimes it's for another time it's not that we'll never talk to a person again or never witness to them again but don't force it because it's a work of God that has to do it you can't put eternal life into somebody you know the scripture says we impart eternal life how do we apart impart eternal life by giving them the word because the word is where the life is it's not in me or you to give it that way I can't give someone the Holy Ghost I can't give someone the new birth but I can show them the word that'll lead them to the New Birth which will take him into the holy spirit amen and maybe so our lives are not happens to answer chants or blind luck our young people that are sitting here and even myself being born into a message church this end time message is not luck that's the calling of God that's the ordination of God in our lives that would do that but yet we have people like brother Mark and brother grant that came out of other systems and that is no less the ordination of God 's got to start with something and usually he's got to stop with something that's outside and then he'll keep people inside of it but he's got to have ones that'll answer that call and come out of these things amen even our own uh brother Gerald you know out of Pentecost and Salvation Army and that to come out of those things to come into the full truth that takes what a deep inside that'll pull you out of that because most people can never break free of these things amen so what the scripture and Revelation that we are looking at says what you are ordained to eternal life you are ordained to overcome you are ordained to be victorious you are ordained to produce the word for this age you are ordained to have a family that can serve God you are ordained to have the fruits of the spirit in your life amen you're ordained to tear down the works of Satan's kingdom in your life first and then in others afterwards and then you're ordained to all of these things amen it's an all or nothing proposition remember God is an absolute so he doesn't start us to fail us and so he's going to give it all to you or he's not going to give it to you in the first place it's an all or nothing proposition the only thing is is an All or Nothing proposition for us but we go all in or do we have one leg in and one leg out we're the only thing holding them back Church we're the only thing that's holding them back Jesus would say this he says for I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which has sent me that all of which he hath given me I should lose nothing but shall raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up on the last day brother Brian would look at this and he would say now in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he says the three stages it was an attribute first in God that he thought of himself as being human and then transmitted him down to Jesus and then he says and now if you'll ever be there you were with him then there's only one form of eternal life and that's God and you had to be a part of God at the beginning not just what you chose down here he chose you remember seeds don't have intelligence they are what they are what was put in is what was put in and they didn't choose it but they are what they are by the original Creator the original designer amen so we don't get to choose either we see that with Esau Esau sought time and time again a place of repentance with tears he tried to tap into the life of God he tried to tap into the word of God but he could never do it because it wasn't in him to connect to in the first place and eventually he gave up and he went completely sideways why it wasn't in there in the first place but what's inside of us is the literal expression of God's attributes God's desires and God's intentions for you and I it's all built inside of us everything we have need of is inside of us and all it takes is the is the Holy Spirit by the word to Quicken it that's all it takes and once it started no man can stop at amen but brother I'm saying here we didn't choose him he chose us remember what Jesus said no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise them up in the last days Isaiah will put it this way he says I am sought of them that ask not for me I am found of them that sought me not I said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name in other words he's saying we seek after God because he put something in us to do it not because we in ourselves wanted to do it amen God set a call in our lives and we're Gentiles every one of us were outside of the natural lineage of Abraham we're outside of the natural call children of God yet he says there's people that are going to call on me that aren't even seeking after me he says we seek after him but we didn't ask to do it that's how gracious he is that's how perfect predestination is is we get something that in our in and of ourselves we would never call for we're born outside of it we're born outside of of the original message we're born outside of the original gospel and yet there's something inside of us he says we find God and yet it is not because we look for him but rather because he says behold me he revealed himself to us we didn't go looking for him he stepped into our lives and said here I am the word for your day that's what happened wasn't it brother Mark literally the word stepped in front of him and says here I am and he says whoa that's him that's him and from that minute there was no changing it was a done deal but here's the thing it always was a done deal it always was a done deal but he what got a revelation of what that word was and he stepped into it and it was quickened into life that seed inside of him and all of a sudden he can walk and he can live an overcoming Victorious Life for the rest of his life why because it's inside of him to do it it's just taking the quickening of God Amen brother Graham says this he says where was Jesus slain at Calvary no sir Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world he said behold the land of God Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world God in the beginning when he saw the sin he saw what was happened he spoke the word and Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world and every person that was saved was saved according to the Bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world you were included in Salvation then he says so what are you going to do about it we're talking about a certainty of the seed this morning what are you going to do you're going to change it can you change it you can't it's a finished work it's already done he says it's God blessed be the name of the Lord It's God that worketh not him that willeth or him that runeth but God showeth Mercy hey don't stop working don't stop running but recognize you're doing it because he's called you to do it and he's the one that's given you the power to do it amen he says because the he says uh it was Jesus slain before the foundation of the world and it took 4 000 years before it actually happened you talk about a seed planting 4 000 years but when God spoke it back here every word of God is steadfast it's immutable it's impartable it cannot fail and when God slayed the psalm before the foundation of the world he was just as much slain than as he was at Calvary it's a finished product When God says so that means you're a finished product from back then as well because you were under the blood of the Covenant back then the perfect Covenant the finishing Covenant the Grace Covenant was already there before he ever came you were included in that amen it's already done we sing that song it's already done everything you ever needed was finished before you ever even arrived on this planet he says and remember when the lamb was slain your salvation was included in the sacrifice the but because the Bible said that your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he says what about that then what are we going to do it's God that shows Mercy it's God that called you it's God that chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world Jesus said you never chose me I chose you and I knew you before the foundation of the world there you are so you weren't just a believer and he says well there's going to be a believer named Rebecca coffee or Dale won't slager no no you're ordained to be a believer today in this age and he said in that layout to see an age I'm going to have children of God and I'm going to have sons of God and I'm going to have daughters of God and they're going to overcome and they're going to live Victorious and they're going to have hard times but they're going to come through them and they're going to make difficult decisions but I'm going to be with them in those times they're going to have Financial issues but I'm going to still provide they're going to have health issues but I'm still gonna heal and I'm going to produce a perfect word out of all of these things amen listen what's he saying he's saying you are a finished work that's the second certainty it's not just that it's in you but then it's going to come out because he put a name next to the attribute that is you in the word of God Amen amen we saw this in our opening scripture this morning that we are here by the choosing of God and that alone is what makes us children of God Amen we cannot die we cannot lose we cannot be forsaken we cannot be destroyed nothing what can separate us from the love of God Church what's going on in your life that can separate you from that from a name that's already written in a book that cannot be erased that's how perfect that's how he says immutable it cannot be changed he cannot change his mind he chooses perfectly from the beginning you are his perfect choice you are his perfect choice can you say it this morning I am his perfect choice if only we could receive it every day and say I am his choice he chose me to walk before him in love and grace and mercy and power and authority and victory every single day no matter what conditions no matter how dirty it is whether it's a drought season whether it's a wet season whether it's the middle of the summer that we're loving right now or whether it's the coldest winter we've ever had yet he has called me to walk before him in perfection in his word he chose me perfectly amen it's a work of God start to finish and it's a finished work and we're just in a body of time to prove it out but it's already done let's go back to our original scripture he says for the Lord had chosen Zion who is Zion Zion is always the bride always the bride you have Jerusalem which is Israel but inside of Jerusalem is Mount Zion and that's the bride that's the chosen place that's the dwelling place of God he says the Lord had chosen the Zion who desired it he had desired it what for as a trophy for his habitation God has chosen us he has desired us to be his habitation amen you can't want it unless he desired it first remember because he's got to call us first it's his desire that puts a desire inside of you he says this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it how long forever why because he's already declared it in his word he cannot change it he chose perfectly amen you are the Eternal resting place of God why because you're a part of his word God is his word God is in his word amen this is what we're talking about this morning this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it you know what that means even when I don't want it it's not going to change it you ever have a day where you woke up and you said it's going to be a rough one listen we wake up and we know we've got things ahead of us in a day that aren't going to be easy and you know why they're not easy it's because we're going to do it by the word and that is not the easiest thing to do because every gun in hell is turned against people that will put the word before them every day we wake up it's going to be a battle and sometimes it's less of a battle than others but it's still going to be a battle every single day amen it's not always easy being a Christian and then we're not carried to heaven on beds of ease they remember Warriors it's a it's a battle every single day to live this Christian walk remember the battle shouldn't be internal the battle should be externally men he says before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost can I get the Holy Ghost brother John you were in his thoughts to get it because that's the only thing that'll Quicken what's inside of you if he chose you perfectly he has to give the perfect provision as well and that's his very own life before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd be wanting it if you've got a desire for it it's because he put it there he says and he chose you himself because you desired he says he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you were on the earth and He sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself he says oh that is so rich to me to think it's not what I wanted I told you before I had great plans to not serve the Lord come on now I had great plans to have great plans I was going to be a doctor and I was going to make hundreds of thousands of dollars and have great sports cars and have an enjoyable life in big homes and great vacations and a beautiful wife and he gave me one of those things but but there was nothing in me that desired that but he chose me and when the moment came he turned my heart like that and there was never going back and all of a sudden I saw what we read in Jeremiah 29 11 this morning that he thinks great thoughts towards us he's already thought him he doesn't change him and it's to bring you to an expected end men thoughts of Peace not of evil the way he looks rough but there's peace through it all and there's something waiting at the end that's worth it all he said to think it's not what I wanted it wasn't my desires it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing I had not one thing to do with it and if you didn't have it that back then you don't have one thing to do with it now God's going to get you he's going to get you stop fighting you keep putting off that decision you know you're supposed to make stop fighting and just do it because God's going to get you there one way or the other like I said before I was 10 when I started to feel the pull of God in my life to give my heart to him and it was 17 until I gave it to him seven years of misery imagine what he could have done perhaps if I would have done it at 10 instead of 17. but yet he preserved me he kept me mostly right don't put it off because he's already chosen you you're not going to get away from it that desire's in there and it's saying it's not going away he says I had not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started God saw us and put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a world he says talk about God that's the kind of God we serve that's the kind of God we serve amen that he has ordained it he has predestinated he has planned it and then he spoke it and now it's got to happen but if I would say this and whatever Christ was I am really can we say that word that this morning whatever Christ was I am what he is I am what Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever remember he said we are in the same flesh producing the same word that Jesus Christ did I'm just not all of it but I'm the same stuff what was that slogan the right stuff we're the right stuff we're exactly the same as him we're just a teaspoon out of the ocean but it's no less it's no less God Amen he says oh God if he is considered a fanatic so must I be if he was a Beelzebub by The Works of his spirit I am too so when people prop you up and say you're a wonderful son and daughter of God say praise the Lord and when they say well you're be yells above then say praise the Lord as well because they call them both he says whatever he was I am whatever he was you are we must be the makers of her immortality her Freedom or her Fame her glory or her shame he's talking about the bride we must be that we must be the church the Bride of Jesus Christ I live with him on the earth when he lived I die with him when he died I rose with him when he rose I'm assembled and seated with him now in Heavenly places because I'm part of him wherever he is there I am where my servant is there will I be also he says now he can fellowship with us and through us and rest his word with us which we are a part of his word if he is the word and we are part of him then we are part of the word he says now transforming he can transform us through his word that we can rest because we are a part of it where's our rest today is our rest because we're sitting in this church this morning is our rest because we've heard the prophet of Malachi 4. that cannot be our rest don't stop those things don't look past those things but many heard Jesus message and went all the way to hell many were sitting in the day of scriptures being fulfilled and never fulfilled a single one that is not what makes us Believers amen those are good things don't lose sight of them but our rest is in what the choosing of God the ordained will of God the purpose of God the election of God the desires of God and that's what's keeping us moving forward because his word cannot return to him void we sang that song Last service something keeps holding me there are days where it feels like we don't have any strength and yet we Press On we keep going why because his word cannot return to him void and it keeps pulling us forward and forward and forward and Higher and Higher and Higher and Away in a way and away from the world until one day we're going to step right off of this planet amen he can transform us through his word that we can rest because we are a part of it amen his choosing puts a desire in us to choose him and after that comes what the holy spirit that quickens the life inside of us to produce the word for our day listen to this this is one of the most beautiful things I think in scripture I can put myself here it says and the Lord said Simon Simon and the Lord said Jonathan Jonathan and the Lord said Kingsley Kingsley and the Lord said Abby Abby Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat now you think about what sifting wheat is right so he used to do the threshing floor and what would they do they would throw it up in the air to blow the chaff away but if you get a strong enough wind and you can get that wheat up in there it'll blow it away from all the other wheat and it won't be gathered into the Garner it'll be separated out of Fellowship they'll be separated out from hearing the word and he'll get you out to a place where there's nobody else around you and then the question is will you survive or not he says Satan's trying to do this he's trying to sift you out he's trying to get you separated he's trying to get you away from fellowship trying to get you away from Believers trying to get you away from the preaching hearing of the word trying to get you out of the place where you'll grow he says but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren Church that's their we are there that wasn't just for Peter Jesus said I sanctify myself for what them those that are coming he did all of this he wasn't just praying for Peter he was praying for the complete elect lady the entire bride of Christ there that they would not fail and listen this is one man whose prayers are always answered amen we're before the throne of grace he's ever interceding for those needs for us amen that we will not fail that the world will produce what it said inside of us amen but you know sometimes we forget we forget we're Zion we forget where the bride of Christ we get caught up in situations we get caught up because our finances aren't doing well we get caught up because our health isn't going so well we get caught up because our marriage is struggling we get caught up because our job is on Rocky ground of some sort and the conditions surround us and all of a sudden we start to forget I'm the chosen elect Lady of God maybe it's just me but there's days where you're not really sure who and what you are because Satan gets our eyes off of what what the word says about us and we start to feed on circumstances rather than feed on to finish work that was done before the foundation of the world Amen you know what I love God knows when we get in those places he knows it and he understands it and he knows it so well that he actually wrote about it he wrote about a Zion that felt forsaken why because he knew we were going to feel forsaken you know that circumstances would make us think that we're forsaken that in the down times we think that he'd left us that when we pray that he wouldn't hear us that when we'd ask he wouldn't heal us and we get down down down and we'd feel Forsaken and he gave us a word for The Forsaken ones he didn't say those silly people why are they always forgetting don't they read my word don't they listen to my message don't they go to church twice a week why do I have to no no he didn't say that he could be touched by your infirmities by our weaknesses by our shortcomings by our human frailties and he said this in Isaiah 49 he says but Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten me anyone felt forsaken lately prayers unanswered situations not moving clients not coming jobs not changing children not being saved we feel forsaken at times that doesn't mean he doesn't hear us that doesn't mean he's not moving but you've got to take yourself back to what he said about you amen you can't lose the Holy Ghost you can't lose it once you got it you're sealed to the day of your Redemption so never get that thought in your mind that I had it but I lost it now you may never have had it you may never have had it but if you ever get it you'll never lose it and here's the thing once he gives it to you once he'll fill you over and over and over and over again and sometimes that's what we're feeling forsaken is because we just haven't had a feeling in a while and that's what we really need is we need God to fill our lives again amen he says this can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will I not forget thee our sisters when they have babies once that baby is born and they nurse for that first time that mother will never forget that child he says they might God says they might he says but I won't you're that dear to me he says behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continuously before me never forgets us never forsakes us though appearance appearances may say otherwise in our own eyes sometimes power remind us in Hebrews he says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee what's Paul saying he's saying you're looking at your life and you're saying brother Paul has a nicer estate than I do and brother Matt has a nicer car than I do and brother Bob has a nicer retirement than I do and brother John has a Pulpit and I don't and this sisters no no no no he says that's not what you're supposed to be looking at be content with what he's given you once he said I have said I will never leave thee or forsake thee remember what do you tell Abraham I am thy ice exceeding great reward just remember I'm with you that's the thing that matters most in all of this we're not going to take anything with us except our character the nice car is going to burn just as well as the old car the small house is going to burn just as much as the big house the hundred thousand dollars in the bank is going to burn just as much as the minus 50. it's all going but he says what take take peace take rest with the fact that I said I'll never leave you or forsake you Joshua 1 5. this is our scripture he says there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee but he's not moving Brother John situations getting worse I will not fail thee listen he was four days late for Lazarus they thought amen why do you have to let them die in the first place four days late but he was right on time amen God will let you get right down to the very last millimeter of disaster and then he'll step in look at the three Hebrew children I think brother Berry was talking about it wasn't he brought right up to where everyone around them is dying and death seems certain at the very last step and they have to step in and God still isn't there as far as they can see but yet they're standing in conditions that would kill any other Mortal and yet they're living and then they step right into the fire and nothing happens except their bonds are broken why he was with him all the time and then he appeared and he fellowship with them and they were so happy to be in his presence they didn't even walk out of the fire they waited for the king to call them out that's how comfortable they were in the fire why because the presence of God the son of man the Son of God was right in their midst showing them he had been with them all the time encouraging his children you know this life it's meant to grind us down this is a grinder you know there's that that saying that life chews us up and spits us out and Satan's goal is to get us so beat up and so worn out and so tired and so stressed that we're just like that limp dish rag on the side of the sink and it's good for nothing it has no resistance it has no strength it has no use it's just laying on who completely beat out why because he wants to put doubt inside of us to counteract the faith that God has already anchored inside of us that's all he's trying to do he's trying to get us to feed on doubt which is circumstance rather than Faith which is the word promise that's it and you know what wins brother Brown would say I got a black dog and a white dog remember he tells a story which ones which one's winning whichever one I'm feeding the most when times get tough you know what makes them tougher when you're not feeding on the right things is that simple it's that simple you feed on the word then you're going to get word results you'll feed on doubt you'll get doubt results which is always going to be opposite to what the word says amen but if he could ever get if you could ever get to the place where every time it comes up you go back and you say I want to see what God said about me I want to see what God said about the situation and you look until you find it that'll build faith in you like you've never had before because now you've got a resting place remember he says God wants to have a place where he can rest his word in you rest his word in you you got to feed on it you got to take it for yourself amen but if we can walk in those promises that's when Victory comes took him many years to take Canaan but after a few little initial hiccups they never lost a battle why because they stuck with what God had told them to do every single time Deuteronomy 11 18 this is Moses speaking of children of Israel he says therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes that's what we call blinders on a horse and you notice when that horse is wearing blinders he can't see anything because remember a horse's eyes are on the side of his head so that horse is completely blind to what's going on around him he can hear and he can feel and he can smell and all these things but he can't see a single thing and the only thing that guides him is what the Reigns so he has to completely trust that the driver that's holding the reins sees everything that's going on that's what the word has already taken care of God's already ordained what's going to happen and you just have to walk in it he's saying let the word guide you it also means don't look at what's going on don't look at what's going on because that's only going to raise concerns we're in Satan's eating looking around just raises concerns doesn't it don't look around look at the word let them be if word is frontlets all you can see is the word the word the word all you can read is the word the word the word all you can hear is the word the word the word and you have what The Guiding Light of the Holy Spirit that's pushing you along where that word tells you to go laughs and he says if you do this every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours why because the word's guiding you see this is where we get this this Doctrine mixed up and speak the word and do this and that no no to do that you've got to be guided by the word and we'll get into this in the next few Services where brother Brown would say you take the word for your day for your age for your position for your place and that's what you're speaking you're not running willy-nilly around but you're put taking what the word for you and you speak that and you walk in that and you possess that because you can't go after another day's message you can't go for another day's results you're here for this day's results by the word amen so those word that word is in front of you and all you can see is the word we should really do it like this because as humans this is the way we do it and all you can see is the word the word the word the word the word and you're just walking the way that word tells you to go it's so simple remember that a man though a fool should not air therein if you keep the word before you he says every place we're on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness in Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even Under the uttermost Sea shall your Coast be there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he has said unto you our Assurance is not just that we are his children but that we are his name-written children in a book of life that there's a specific person there's a specific personality there's a specific body there's a specific lineage that he has called out to be his children in this age amen he wrote our names on a Lamb's Book of Life and then that means we're destined for life eternal life that we're destined for overcoming power that were destined for victory that were destined for grace and mercy that were destined for the fruits of the spirit that were destined to bring Salvation to others that were destined to produce the word for this age perfectly and exactly as he has called for it to be amen he'll take us all the way into maturity all the way into that final resurrection that final Rapture that moment where we step into total glorification and we are exactly exactly as he is the promise of his word Jesus said this he said the thief cometh not but for to still steal and to kill and destroy I am come that they might have life that's it life to do what produce the word that's what life is the word made flesh he says that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen that there's more than what I have today I'm resting in that I'm trusting in that that there's more than what I have today not that it's not laid before me but there's more for me to be expressed because why there's a desire in me for more there's something in me that's calling out for more that's saying Lord make me more like you Lord draw out more of the word not just for my sake but for the benefit of those that are around me then we would draw people unto him that we would draw people to Calvary not to ourselves but that they could see a shining light in a dark world amen one more quote as we close brother Bible say this he says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Now Catch This there can be no satisfaction until this word which is God becomes alive in you and then you see God himself fulfilling the promises that he made in the Bible that's what I'm seeking for every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line that's written about me we've got Redemptive promises and then we've got adoptive promises and some of them are only for certain people in certain positions and some of them are for everyone that's a child of God healing is for everybody that's a children's bread the Holy Ghost is for everybody that's what proves your son or daughter of God in the first place but there's things that are ordained just for mothers just for fathers just for ministers Just For Men just for women but he says you won't have any satisfaction there'll be no satisfaction until what this word becomes alive in you fulfilling what the promises of this age what's the greatest promise Resurrection or rapture that's all I care about that's all I care about that's all that's left for us is a resurrection and a Rapture amen amen let's stand together if we would amen we have a certainty not just of what's inside of us but that he's going to bring it out and I love that he put our names on that book amen they just didn't say you know God ties himself to things that's the beauty of it I think that's what makes him consistent is because he ties himself to it he doesn't leave it to well it might work and it might not work or it might go this way it might go that way so I'm going to wait and see how things turn out and then I'm going to choose the next step no no he ordains it from start to finish that's why it's a finished work that's why we can have rest in it is because nothing can change it it may wiggle around and try and get away but each each critical point he brings us back exactly to where we need to be and brings us back along the paths of Sons and Daughters of God Amen amen let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father lord it's wonderful to stand in a certain place this morning Lord of your calling of your choosing of your predestination of your election Lord of you putting something inside of us that we could never put inside Lord and we're just wanting to sit in your presence Lord not just this
