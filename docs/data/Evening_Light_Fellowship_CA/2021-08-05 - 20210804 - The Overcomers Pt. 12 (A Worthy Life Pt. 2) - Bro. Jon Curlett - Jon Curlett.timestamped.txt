[35:43] turn the scriptures to ephesians chapter
[35:46] 4 tonight

[35:49] amen greet our brother mcnelly here
[35:51] tonight amen brother it's good to have
[35:52] you here god bless you we are a small
[35:55] group so everyone that we add is a big
[35:58] addition amen we've got about 30 we have
[36:00] one we've got three percent more power i
[36:02] figure so uh
[36:04] we need to keep adding more people in
[36:05] amen
[36:06] amen good to have you brother god bless
[36:08] you ephesians chapter four just the
[36:10] first scripture says i therefore the
[36:12] prisoner of the lord beseech you that
[36:15] you walk worthy of the vocation
[36:17] wherewith ye are called i put the
[36:20] amplified up here it says i therefore
[36:22] the prisoner of the lord appeal to and
[36:25] beg you to lead a life worthy of the
[36:27] divine calling to which you have been
[36:30] called with behavior that is a credit to
[36:33] the summons to god's service amen god
[36:37] bless you you can have your seats this
[36:39] evening amen we want to continue on our
[36:40] series on the overcomers and i want to
[36:42] finish off this idea of a worthy life
[36:44] amen and last time we we spoke on joshua
[36:47] and we covered his commission
[36:49] amen
[36:50] and we talked about how that was a
[36:51] worthy life but so often when we look at
[36:54] joshua we say well his life was worthy
[36:55] because he fought great battles and he
[36:57] won great victories and he did this and
[36:59] he did that but there were many people
[37:01] that fought many battles through history
[37:02] and their lives were not considered
[37:04] worthy what we forget with joshua is
[37:06] that he was fulfilling the word for his
[37:08] day amen the promise was given to
[37:10] abraham over 400 years before that and
[37:12] he said that i'm going to take you into
[37:14] land flowing with milk and honey and
[37:15] it's going to be a place for you and i'm
[37:16] going to be your god and you're going to
[37:18] be my people and i'm going to give it to
[37:20] you and it's going to be a supernatural
[37:21] event and then what happened is god
[37:23] comes up to the river jordan with joshua
[37:25] and he says joshua today is the day for
[37:27] the word to start being fulfilled amen
[37:29] not not a word of another day but now
[37:31] there's a word for your day that has to
[37:32] be fulfilled joshua and you're the man
[37:34] that i'm commissioning to do it amen so
[37:36] it wasn't just an idea of him going and
[37:38] being in battles and doing this or doing
[37:39] that but rather what he was doing was
[37:41] stepping into the word for his day and
[37:43] he was doing it amen and with god by his
[37:45] side with that captain of the host
[37:47] brother remember he said that that was
[37:48] the holy spirit come down in a man that
[37:50] was christ himself the captain of the
[37:52] host he said with that captain of the
[37:54] host leading the way they never lost the
[37:55] battle amen and that's what our
[37:57] commission is amen is to step into the
[37:58] word for our day and do what god has
[38:00] called us to do and be what god has
[38:02] called us to be in this age now i want
[38:05] to notice here we're talking about a
[38:06] worthy life we're not talking about a
[38:08] worthy person because our worthiness as
[38:10] a person has already been declared amen
[38:12] when he took our place on calvary that's
[38:14] when he said you are worthy because you
[38:16] were worthy to lay down my life you are
[38:18] worthy to take that because i chose you
[38:20] you are a part of me and i'm giving my
[38:22] life for you so this is not about
[38:24] whether or not you're a worthy person
[38:25] amen whether your life is worthy isn't
[38:27] going to have any effect on your eternal
[38:29] destination if you're a child of god
[38:31] amen the scripture says that every man
[38:32] is going to be tried and his work is
[38:34] going to be tried and it's going to be
[38:35] put through fire and if it lasts through
[38:37] fire great but even if it doesn't it
[38:39] says the soul of that man is still saved
[38:40] amen this this worthy life we're talking
[38:42] about is how we spend our time and our
[38:44] energy on this planet amen and is that
[38:47] worthy is it something that's going to
[38:48] pass through the fire of god's judgment
[38:50] of the of the word that he has placed in
[38:52] front of us will it pass that test and
[38:54] be something that's considered of
[38:55] eternal value amen
[38:58] amen but we don't as always we don't
[39:00] want to leave it in the past and that's
[39:01] why we read joshua and we say well
[39:03] that's what it looked like then but we
[39:04] want to bring it into our day and then
[39:06] we don't want it to be about great men
[39:08] and women of faith in the old but we
[39:09] want to be great men and women of faith
[39:11] today amen and that's people that will
[39:13] take the word of god into their own
[39:15] lives and say the lord's calling me to
[39:16] be this to do this and i'm going to do
[39:18] it in obedience and in faith because
[39:20] he's telling me to do it in the first
[39:22] place amen
[39:23] amen we don't want to be those people
[39:25] that say well it's for another day that
[39:27] we can sit here and so we can play
[39:29] around i mean this was way above and
[39:30] beyond what they were worth
[39:32] in the eyes of the world amen but even
[39:34] after that was done there were still
[39:35] seats available amen so he sent his
[39:37] servants out to gather them from the
[39:39] highways then he says go into the hedges
[39:41] now who goes in the hedges it's the
[39:43] homeless it's the drunks that have
[39:45] fallen there when they've had they've
[39:46] had a bender on the night before and
[39:48] they're laying there passed out waiting
[39:50] to wake up in the morning amen it's the
[39:52] scum of the earth that lay and they're
[39:53] the off-cast the one that have no money
[39:55] they have no job nothing nothing to
[39:57] offer he says there's still room so
[39:59] bring in those ones
[40:00] amen and he brings them in
[40:03] and now the feast is first he says now
[40:05] we can start the feast and then so we
[40:07] look at the ones that are in the feast
[40:08] and their worthiness has nothing to do
[40:10] with them i'll say it again the
[40:12] worthiness is in the one that called
[40:13] them not in them amen and if we look at
[40:16] that amen we're not going to perform
[40:18] ourselves into the kingdom of heaven
[40:19] because he says this is a this is a
[40:21] representation of the kingdom of heaven
[40:23] we're talking about so we talk about a
[40:24] worthy life and we say well if i do this
[40:26] and this and this i'm going to get into
[40:28] heaven listen you get into heaven by the
[40:29] new birth that's the only way you get in
[40:32] and anything you do on top of that is
[40:34] just gravy as we would say that's
[40:36] something to you to have on your crown
[40:37] that you can lay at his feet when you
[40:39] get in there amen so we're not going to
[40:41] perform our way in there because we've
[40:42] seen it and i say it over and over again
[40:44] they come to him in that day and they
[40:45] say we did a lot of great things in your
[40:47] name and he says get out i never knew
[40:48] you and then you're not going to perform
[40:50] your way into eternal life but you're
[40:52] going to have it by a new birth which is
[40:54] him putting his life inside of you
[40:55] you're sealed to the day of your
[40:56] redemption in your soul and that's what
[40:58] he's coming back for is the word that he
[41:00] sealed you with amen that that seed that
[41:02] we've talked about so often that was in
[41:04] you from before the foundation of the
[41:06] world amen
[41:08] amen so what is it paul says walk worthy
[41:11] to the fact that you've been called to
[41:12] the feast not because you're some great
[41:14] person not because you've done this or
[41:15] that but because he's called you act
[41:17] like what he's called you to be amen
[41:21] verse 11 now says though we've got all
[41:23] these people that have no right to be
[41:25] there
[41:26] and yet even in the midst of this watch
[41:27] what happens now verse 11. it says and
[41:29] when the king came in to see the guests
[41:31] he saw there a man which had not on a
[41:33] wedding garment now remember i've told
[41:35] you before the in those weddings what
[41:36] they do is they put the wedding garment
[41:38] on every single person that came in so
[41:40] everybody more or less looked the same
[41:42] so there were no big eyes and no little
[41:44] use and then everybody looked the same
[41:46] so there was a quality among the guests
[41:48] now the king comes and he says there's a
[41:50] guy here that doesn't have the wedding
[41:52] garment and he said to him friend he
[41:54] doesn't look at him as an enemy he says
[41:56] friend
[41:57] how came you in hither not having a
[42:00] wedding garment how'd you get in because
[42:03] anyone that came in the way i told them
[42:04] to come in
[42:06] is going to have a wedding garment there
[42:07] was no shortage of wedding garments so
[42:09] you must have come in a different way
[42:11] how is it that you're sitting here and
[42:12] you look different than everybody else
[42:14] it says and the man was speechless
[42:17] then said the king to the servants bind
[42:19] him hand and foot and take him away and
[42:21] cast them into outer darkness there
[42:23] shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[42:25] for many are called but few are chosen
[42:30] so we see this man
[42:32] comes in and there was only one one rule
[42:34] to be a guest an accepted guest in that
[42:36] wedding there was no moral criteria
[42:38] there was no job criteria no education
[42:40] criteria the criteria was put on the
[42:42] garment that i give you at the door come
[42:44] in by the door and then put on the
[42:46] wedding garment that i've told you to
[42:47] put on him and the man didn't do it he
[42:49] snuck in another way and you'd say why
[42:51] would you sneak in
[42:52] he's he's obviously invited everybody in
[42:55] why did you feel the need to sneak in
[42:57] because that's what he had to do to not
[42:58] get a wedding garment he tried to get in
[42:59] on his own basis and then he tried to
[43:01] come in based on something he'd done he
[43:03] snuck in and felt well i'll just blend
[43:05] in with the other guests they'll never
[43:06] know that i wasn't here but he forgot
[43:08] one thing anybody that he calls in he
[43:09] gives him the wedding garment too amen
[43:11] and that's the great equalizer for us is
[43:13] his righteousness amen and it's
[43:14] signified by the holy spirit in our
[43:16] lives and if you've got the holy spirit
[43:18] and i've got the holy spirit there's no
[43:19] difference i'm no bigger than you and
[43:20] i'm no smaller than you brother brahm
[43:22] said after the opening of the seals he
[43:23] says there are no great ones among us
[43:25] amen and that's the prophet of god to
[43:27] this age saying there are no great ones
[43:29] among us why if you're a holy
[43:31] ghost-filled believer and i'm a holy
[43:32] ghost-filled believer we're all equal in
[43:34] his sight amen
[43:35] amen hallelujah amen to refuse the
[43:39] king's garment was to accept judgment
[43:41] to turn it down to turn down his way of
[43:43] coming in was to be judged amen he could
[43:46] have come in
[43:48] the way the king said but he refused to
[43:49] do it and that meant judgment and he
[43:51] couldn't answer why did i come in any
[43:53] other way than but the way he told me to
[43:54] amen
[43:55] amen so this worthy life is not
[43:57] determined by you or me it's determined
[43:58] by him and we've got to be worthy in the
[44:00] way that he deems to be worthy rather
[44:02] than the way that we feel is worthy amen
[44:05] i've been reading a bit from brother
[44:06] lonnie jenkins in the the last few weeks
[44:08] and he talks about finding your position
[44:10] in christ and when he first came to the
[44:12] message or even before that he always
[44:14] looked at that as being you know part of
[44:15] the five full ministry or having you
[44:17] know one of the nine spiritual gifts in
[44:19] the church and that was finding your
[44:20] your way into the body of christ amen
[44:22] but he says those those are all just
[44:24] elements
[44:25] of that and your first priority is to
[44:27] first find your way into the body amen
[44:30] you've got to be in there you've got to
[44:31] be compatible with the body you've got
[44:33] to have the same buildup as the rest of
[44:34] the body and so you've got to have that
[44:37] settled before you ever start saying
[44:38] where do i fit into this body so first
[44:40] corinthians 12 says now concerning
[44:42] spiritual breath spiritual gifts
[44:44] brethren i would not have you ignorant
[44:46] and then paul cycles through the nine
[44:47] spiritual gifts all the way down to
[44:49] verse 11 he says
[44:51] all of these gifts that i just talked
[44:52] about worketh but all of these worketh
[44:54] that one in the same
[44:56] self-same spirit what he's saying
[44:57] there's the holy spirit is the one that
[44:59] works those gifts that operates those
[45:00] gifts it's not men that operate him but
[45:02] it's the holy spirit in the body in
[45:04] those people that's operating those
[45:06] gifts so it says in all of these worketh
[45:08] that one and self-same spirit dividing
[45:10] to every man severally as he will so
[45:13] it's the holy spirit that divides those
[45:14] up amongst us and gives them to us amen
[45:17] it's not our worthiness that determines
[45:18] it but it's the holy spirit it's for
[45:20] ordained brother branham said i don't
[45:21] have the quote here but he says god knew
[45:23] who would use those gifts properly and
[45:25] he gives them to them amen
[45:27] for as the body is one and had many
[45:29] members and all the members of that one
[45:30] body be many are one body so also is
[45:33] christ so he says there's a whole bunch
[45:35] of parts to a regular body and there's a
[45:36] whole bunch of parts to the body of
[45:38] christ amen the myth the mystical body
[45:40] of christ that brother brahm talked
[45:41] about amen for by one spirit are we all
[45:44] baptized into one body whether we be
[45:46] jews or gentiles whether we be bond or
[45:48] free and have been all made to drink
[45:50] into one spirit for the body is not one
[45:53] member but one but many amen i can point
[45:55] you to many people today that are using
[45:58] gifts that are 100 percent gifts of the
[46:00] holy spirit but they're using them for
[46:02] their own gain
[46:03] amen brother brandon when you get into
[46:04] anointed ones at the end time and
[46:06] whatnot he'll talk about people that are
[46:07] literally anointed by the holy spirit
[46:09] but they're doing it in a way that
[46:11] doesn't please god him and they take
[46:12] that anointing and they use it for their
[46:14] own purpose and their own pleasures amen
[46:16] why gifts and callings are without
[46:18] repentance amen when you look at
[46:19] pentecost they they went off on the
[46:21] gifts amen the baptism of the holy
[46:23] spirit was there and they ran off with
[46:24] the gifts and you go into a pentecostal
[46:26] church today and you can see them
[46:27] operating the gifts of the holy spirit
[46:29] amen but you can look through scripture
[46:31] and you can see tons of people that had
[46:33] gifts callings
[46:35] very real ones and yet
[46:38] they didn't have god and then they had
[46:39] the gift but they didn't have the giver
[46:40] you look at judas iscariot was a member
[46:42] of the group of disciples that was given
[46:44] power and authority to
[46:46] to to what cast out demons and heal
[46:47] diseases
[46:49] right and he went out and he did the
[46:50] exact same signs and wonders as they did
[46:52] and yet where was he when christ was
[46:53] hanging on the cross much less when he
[46:55] came out and was raised from the dead
[46:57] and they're up in the in in the room at
[46:58] pentecost he's not there is he he's the
[47:00] son of perdition that was revealed for
[47:02] that day you look at balaam balaam was a
[47:05] prophet of god there's no way that you
[47:07] can dispute anything but that balaam was
[47:09] a prophet of god balaam had one-on-one
[47:10] conversations with god right he went in
[47:13] and god talked to him just as almost as
[47:16] if he would to moses he it was very
[47:17] clear he knew what god said and he knew
[47:19] what god wanted him to do
[47:21] and yet what happens is balaam starts to
[47:23] what take that gift and say well
[47:25] somebody wants me to use this gift for
[47:26] them and so he goes to god and he pushes
[47:28] and he pushes and he pushes until god
[47:30] says yeah you can go but the only words
[47:32] you'll say will be the words that i put
[47:33] in your mouth and balaam goes there
[47:36] he can only say blessings but he helps
[47:38] lead them into idolatry a sin that god
[47:40] that brother brahm said god never
[47:41] forgave israel for it and balaam ends up
[47:43] killed by the israelites in the end of
[47:45] it all amen a true gift a true calling a
[47:47] true prophet and yet where's god in it
[47:50] right what is it he got pulled away into
[47:52] his own desires amen he wanted to have
[47:54] the money he wanted to have the
[47:55] popularity he wanted to have the
[47:56] recognition of a powerful king look at
[47:59] the prophets of ahab now this one is
[48:01] scary because the prophets of ahab were
[48:03] true prophets you'll never find in
[48:04] scripture that says that they were false
[48:06] prophets it says they were of the
[48:07] prophets amen there's 450 of them they
[48:11] are true genuine proven prophets but
[48:13] what happened was ahab came and ahab
[48:16] wanted a directed prophecy
[48:18] right when you're in court a judge can
[48:20] tell you to do a directive verdict he'll
[48:22] say you must find this person guilty and
[48:24] what happened was ahab went to those
[48:25] prophets and he says i need you to tell
[48:27] me that i'm going to be victorious
[48:28] because i got jehoshaphat here and he's
[48:30] looking for direction from god and if
[48:32] all the prophets say that this is going
[48:34] to be a victory for us then he'll be on
[48:35] my side so he says go in there and you
[48:38] go find the word of the lord and make
[48:39] sure it's victory for me
[48:41] and what happened was those prophets
[48:42] wanted to please the king rather than be
[48:45] true prophets and in that desire god
[48:48] allows god even sends a lying spirit
[48:50] because the lion spirit always wants to
[48:52] get on the prophet because if he can get
[48:53] him off one time then the people won't
[48:55] listen to him anymore right so the lion
[48:57] spirit's saying let me go let me go let
[48:59] me go and the desire of that prophet of
[49:02] those 450 prophets opens them up to a
[49:04] lying suggestion and all of a sudden
[49:06] that spirit comes down they feel the
[49:08] anointing of prophecy on them and they
[49:11] prophesy victory and what is it it is
[49:14] 100 against the word amen god was not in
[49:17] it it was a lying spirit on them and
[49:19] then what happens is mackay is the only
[49:20] one that'll stand up and jehoshaphat
[49:22] being a discerning man says is there one
[49:24] more we have 415 agreements he says is
[49:27] there any more because joshua was a man
[49:29] of god and mackay he says yeah there's
[49:31] one but i hate him
[49:33] why because he was always telling ahab
[49:34] you're in for judgment buddy and so they
[49:36] said well what's it going to be and
[49:37] micaiah says sorry you're going to die
[49:40] amen but what was it those prophets of
[49:43] ahab they had a real gift that was
[49:44] twisted up by their own desire to please
[49:46] men amen amen and then god let them fall
[49:49] into a path of a lying spirit and they
[49:51] would never recover from that amen
[49:53] amen they always stop short because they
[49:55] got their own interests twisted up into
[49:57] god's work
[50:00] sometimes we think we can kind of ride
[50:02] the coattails of god's work
[50:04] and get the things that we want that's
[50:05] not the way it works it's up to him
[50:07] sometimes we get it i can say sometimes
[50:09] i've gotten what i wanted by doing god's
[50:11] will there's plenty of times i didn't
[50:12] get anything but what he wanted me to
[50:14] have amen
[50:16] amen how do we know how do we know we've
[50:19] got the holy spirit
[50:21] how do you know you've got the holy
[50:22] spirit brothers and sisters
[50:24] john says it
[50:25] in first john 4. he says beloved
[50:28] believe not every spirit but try the
[50:31] spirits whether they are of god because
[50:33] many false prophets are gone out into
[50:35] the world false anointed ones brother
[50:37] branham called them amen
[50:39] hereby know ye the spirit of god so you
[50:41] know it in someone else and you know it
[50:43] in yourself
[50:44] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[50:47] christ is come in the flesh is of god
[50:51] and every spirit that confesseth not
[50:54] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[50:57] is not of god and that is that spirit of
[50:59] antichrist whereof you have heard that
[51:01] it should come and even now already is
[51:04] in the world i want you to catch there
[51:06] it says that every spirit that confesses
[51:09] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[51:12] not has come
[51:14] not will come but is come that means
[51:16] presently is here
[51:19] if you look at some translation
[51:20] translations of the bible they've
[51:22] changed that to has come and you know
[51:24] what they've completely missed what it
[51:26] means to be christ the word amen
[51:28] everything is back there satan is
[51:30] perfectly happy for you to recognize
[51:32] that christ came 2000 years ago
[51:34] he's perfectly happy if you can say god
[51:36] did or god was or the apostles did or
[51:40] the believers did but he cannot stand it
[51:42] when you say we do the believers do god
[51:46] is here amen it's jesus christ the same
[51:48] yesterday today forever satan can't
[51:50] stand that but john says every spirit
[51:52] that confesses that christ is come jesus
[51:54] christ is come today right now in the
[51:57] flesh that's what's of god amen so
[51:59] you've got to recognize that christ has
[52:01] come in the flesh today amen and not
[52:03] just in a prophet
[52:04] amen but that he's come in in a mystical
[52:06] body of the bride the the the believers
[52:09] that are here for this day and that is
[52:10] christ being revealed to this word
[52:12] listen every time christ has come he's
[52:14] been missed
[52:15] every time he's come he's been missed
[52:16] now you say he's only come once but when
[52:18] the seven seals were open brother
[52:20] branham said that christ was revealed in
[52:22] every type and shadow in the book amen
[52:24] and we saw him in joseph we saw him in
[52:26] moses we saw him in abraham we saw him
[52:27] in job we saw him in noah and all these
[52:29] different things and nobody recognized
[52:31] christ the word in those places did they
[52:33] very few did a very few elected but yet
[52:36] christ was still being revealed amen and
[52:39] so he says you've got to do the same
[52:40] thing today john says you can't just
[52:42] look back christ was here but christ is
[52:44] still here amen and he's working in our
[52:46] midst and he's in our midst and you're
[52:47] identified as christ the word today amen
[52:50] so john's telling us to try spirits not
[52:52] people
[52:54] right leave the people out of it you
[52:55] could be sitting next to somebody today
[52:57] that is 100 holy ghost filled but if
[52:59] they've got a spirit on them
[53:01] right you've got to try the spirit and
[53:02] let god take care of the person amen
[53:04] we're not here to put people into hell
[53:06] we're not here to put people into
[53:07] judgment but we're there to try the
[53:09] spirit and then if there's a spirit that
[53:10] we've got to deal with then we deal with
[53:12] it amen but we do it in meekness and we
[53:14] do it in love
[53:15] amen
[53:16] but but john says no you've got to have
[53:18] a jesus a present day jesus christ that
[53:21] has to be confessed that's how you know
[53:22] you've got the holy spirit you can say
[53:24] you can identify jesus christ is here
[53:26] today and you don't want to be doing it
[53:28] just in your brother or your sister man
[53:29] you've got to be able to look in the
[53:30] mirror and say he's here in my life as
[53:32] well
[53:34] amen we saw and we've covered this i'm
[53:36] going to cover very briefly just to
[53:37] refresh our minds amen in john 9 5 jesus
[53:40] said as long as i'm in the world i am
[53:42] the light of the world
[53:44] and then he goes we cover this in that
[53:45] in that sermon walking in the light but
[53:47] then jesus points to the future and he
[53:49] says then speak jesus again unto them
[53:50] saying i am the light of the world he
[53:52] that followeth me shall not walk in
[53:54] darkness but shall have the light of
[53:56] life so he says i am the light and he
[53:58] says the people following after me are
[54:00] going to be the light they're going to
[54:01] have the light
[54:03] and then from there he steps into
[54:04] matthew 5 14 and says ye are the light
[54:06] of the world a city that is set on a
[54:07] hill cannot be hid so jesus shows the
[54:10] transition from him to us very clearly
[54:13] in scriptures and then you go on the day
[54:15] of pentecost and they were not hid amen
[54:17] they came out and they were speaking in
[54:18] tongues and in tongues meaning that they
[54:20] spoke and everybody understood in their
[54:22] language type of tongues and they were
[54:24] not hit anymore everybody knew that
[54:26] something special was happening and they
[54:28] pricked their hearts and they recognized
[54:30] that god was in their midst and all of a
[54:31] sudden 3 000 of them were added to the
[54:33] church and even more day by day as they
[54:35] saw what christ the word being revealed
[54:37] in people
[54:38] not just in a man that had just died on
[54:40] a cross 50 days previous amen amen
[54:42] what you've got to be able to see them
[54:44] in your day you've got to be able to see
[54:45] them in yourself you've got to be able
[54:47] to see them in your brothers and sisters
[54:48] because if you don't recognize them in
[54:49] your brothers and sisters you're going
[54:51] to start judging and criticizing them
[54:52] the same way aren't you
[54:56] paul continues this thought in
[54:57] philippians 2.
[54:59] he says do all things without murmurings
[55:01] and disputings
[55:03] this is the will of god if you if you
[55:05] read the verse before he says when god
[55:06] tells you to do something don't do it
[55:08] with all these murmurings and disputes
[55:09] don't fight the will of god amen he says
[55:12] what that ye may be blameless and
[55:14] harmless the sons of god without rebuke
[55:16] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[55:18] nation among whom you shine as lights in
[55:20] the world brothers i'm going to need a
[55:22] bit more water if i could amen
[55:24] he says what holding forth the word of
[55:27] life now that word holy means you've got
[55:29] it if you're holding it it means you
[55:31] have it in your hands doesn't it doesn't
[55:32] mean that you're offering it but it
[55:34] means you're holding it you've got
[55:35] something to give to them and that's the
[55:37] present-day word which is christ inside
[55:38] of you amen he says that i may rejoice
[55:41] in the day of christ that i have not run
[55:43] in vain neither labored in vain this is
[55:45] the prophet's reward here is to be able
[55:47] to offer the people that accepted the
[55:49] word for their day to christ at the end
[55:51] amen brother braham said paul's going to
[55:53] introduce his group and he was going to
[55:55] introduce his group and each one of them
[55:57] that's their reward is to say lord i did
[55:59] what you said and this is what i'm
[56:01] bringing this is my worthwhile life
[56:03] right i preached what you told me to
[56:04] preach i did what you said to do i went
[56:06] where you said to go i separated myself
[56:08] as you said to separate myself and here
[56:10] is the fruits of it lord i'm offering it
[56:12] all to you and saying this is the work
[56:14] that i've done for you amen amen
[56:18] amen but he says what paul has already
[56:20] said that satan can't confess that
[56:22] christ is here now because when he does
[56:25] thank you two cups
[56:27] bless you
[56:29] he says here that we're holding forth
[56:30] the word of life i mean that we've got
[56:32] something to offer to somebody and it's
[56:34] not just static words it's not just dead
[56:36] religion but we've got a life that we
[56:38] can project out that we can show people
[56:40] that the word that we have that the
[56:41] christ that we have the present day
[56:43] christ in our lives it has an effect and
[56:45] it has power amen and now you can have
[56:47] the same thing i have you can be the
[56:49] same thing i would be amen i remember
[56:51] brother gerald talking about a brother
[56:52] and he said well i want to be like
[56:53] brother so-and-so and he said just get
[56:55] the holy ghost
[56:56] amen there's no limit on who you can be
[56:58] like we all want to be like christ and
[56:59] what happened was that brother saw
[57:01] christ in those men and said i want to
[57:02] be that and brother gerald said you can
[57:04] be it just get the holy ghost because
[57:06] that's what makes them the way they are
[57:07] amen so when we have someone come up and
[57:09] say why are you different it's not
[57:11] because god sent a prophet it's because
[57:12] i've got the holy ghost inside of me now
[57:15] i have the holy ghost that opened up
[57:16] that word and that truth and that's
[57:17] what's changing me from glory to glory
[57:19] and adding line upon line and here a
[57:21] little there a little amen but it's the
[57:22] holy ghost inside of me that is the
[57:24] changer amen it's the one that is the
[57:26] change maker in my life if i could put
[57:28] it that way it's got to be the holy
[57:29] ghost it's not my pastor it's not a
[57:31] preacher any of these things they have
[57:32] an effect but you've got to have the
[57:34] holy ghost you've got to have a
[57:35] quickening power inside of you to
[57:36] receive the word as it comes forth and
[57:38] put it into action in your life amen
[57:40] amen so we're offering a life we can
[57:42] offer true doctrine amen i believe we've
[57:44] got the truth we've got we've got the
[57:46] revealed word we've got an open word we
[57:48] should be able to go in and answer any
[57:50] question from the scripture today
[57:51] there's no excuse god's not winking at
[57:53] ignorance anymore we have everything
[57:55] that we have need of right here amen but
[57:57] it's dead without the holy spirit to
[57:59] quicken it and make it alive in our
[58:00] lives amen amen this is god's life this
[58:03] is god's word this is god's message and
[58:05] this is god's offering to this agent so
[58:06] what we are offering is a message that
[58:08] is a person not just a word that's been
[58:11] spoken over a pulpit amen i remember
[58:13] brother mike parks and dallas said that
[58:14] one time or the when he was he would
[58:16] read the scripture a scripture before
[58:18] they start service and he said the
[58:19] message is not on paper he says the
[58:22] message is a person
[58:23] amen because the message is christ amen
[58:25] and christ is a person and when we
[58:27] accept the message then we become the
[58:29] message and all of a sudden now we've
[58:30] got a person that's being progress you
[58:33] know projected in front of these people
[58:34] rather than just come to my church and
[58:36] and write your name on a book and and do
[58:38] this and do that and you'll feel good
[58:39] and go to heaven amen we're not here to
[58:41] offer a feel-good gospel we're here to
[58:43] offer a reality
[58:44] amen
[58:46] listen to what brother branham said amen
[58:48] we're in the time of the manifestation
[58:49] of the sons and daughters of god that's
[58:51] where we're at amen so you say what does
[58:53] it mean to live a worthy life and this
[58:54] is what brother lonnie jenkins was
[58:56] talking about in the in the things i was
[58:57] reading he says
[58:59] sorry let me go back
[59:01] paul says in second corinthians 3 i'm
[59:02] getting ahead of myself he says you are
[59:04] our epistles written in our hearts known
[59:07] and read of all men that no means you
[59:08] are the reality of what we've said thank
[59:11] you brother matt
[59:13] so what you are epistles written in our
[59:15] hearts known and read of all men that
[59:17] means there's a reality there you don't
[59:18] have to open your mouth for people to
[59:20] see and read what you have in your life
[59:22] amen you should just be able to walk by
[59:24] them to live your life day by day your
[59:26] neighbors should know who you are
[59:27] without ever having to talk to you
[59:28] because there's a consistency and a
[59:30] following of the word of god in your
[59:31] life each and every day
[59:33] amen he says for as much as you are
[59:35] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[59:37] christ ministered so he says we've
[59:39] spoken this and you're the reality
[59:42] written not with ink but with the spirit
[59:44] of the living god not in tables of stone
[59:46] but in fleshy tables of the heart amen
[59:49] he's saying what happened is is that
[59:51] we've preached it and the holy spirit
[59:52] has transcribed that from our spoken
[59:55] word now into your life and it's become
[59:57] a very part of you it's written in your
[59:59] hearts it's written in your minds and
[1:00:01] faith is activating it so that you are
[1:00:03] now the epistle that we've talked about
[1:00:05] all this time we don't have to go preach
[1:00:07] to all the world because you are
[1:00:08] preaching what we've talked about and
[1:00:10] you've got a reality in your life that
[1:00:11] people can see and identify with and if
[1:00:13] the holy spirit can just follow their
[1:00:15] way if they can get in the presence of
[1:00:16] god if they can read their bible without
[1:00:18] a denominational minister to blind their
[1:00:20] eyes then they'll say hey that looks a
[1:00:22] whole lot like the word of god that i'm
[1:00:24] reading how did you get that where do i
[1:00:26] go to get it amen and now you can say
[1:00:28] well we've got an open message we've got
[1:00:30] an open book come in repent be baptized
[1:00:32] how have you been baptized amen you
[1:00:35] might need to fix that and then you can
[1:00:36] get the holy spirit and you can be
[1:00:37] exactly the way i am amen and you can
[1:00:39] progress in the word of god brother
[1:00:42] braham says this
[1:00:43] he says we've got to have a church
[1:00:45] that's washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:00:47] now guess what every denomination is
[1:00:48] fine with that
[1:00:50] right he says and become one with the
[1:00:53] word be the church that's the standard
[1:00:56] that's our worthwhile life is to become
[1:00:58] one with the word
[1:01:00] brother brown
[1:01:01] brother lonnie talks about this he says
[1:01:02] brother brown we get these letters from
[1:01:04] people saying how do i please god how do
[1:01:06] i do this how do that he said become one
[1:01:08] with the word for your day and here's a
[1:01:09] quote for it he says what get under the
[1:01:11] blood because we're still living in
[1:01:13] fleshy bodies amen get under the blood
[1:01:16] keep that covered and then he says
[1:01:18] become one with the word for your day
[1:01:19] that's how you're going to please god
[1:01:20] amen is that simple
[1:01:23] it's not necessarily that it's it's
[1:01:25] simple to say it and then how many here
[1:01:26] would say it's simple to be it not
[1:01:28] exactly amen because why it's a battle
[1:01:30] every single day
[1:01:31] amen you've got because got to become
[1:01:33] one with the word of god for your time
[1:01:35] for your age and for your place and
[1:01:37] position guess what sister brenda's
[1:01:40] going to look different than sister
[1:01:41] maureen's going to look different than
[1:01:42] sister priscilla's going to look
[1:01:43] different than sister priscilla it's
[1:01:44] going to look different than sister
[1:01:45] amber is going to look different than
[1:01:46] sister blanca when it comes to the word
[1:01:48] for their day because they've got a
[1:01:50] particular portion of that word to
[1:01:51] display
[1:01:52] amen nobody sings like sister maureen
[1:01:56] right you can't take that
[1:01:58] but you can sing your way can't you
[1:02:00] sister priscilla and then sister amber
[1:02:02] can follow up sister amber only sings
[1:02:04] once or twice a year but it is so spot
[1:02:06] on every single time isn't it it's a
[1:02:07] tremendous blessing then we've got kim
[1:02:09] there perf pitch perfect who can match
[1:02:11] her and then she's got another place to
[1:02:13] do and then sister lily comes in and she
[1:02:15] adds her songs what each one of them has
[1:02:17] a similar gift in terms of it's a gift
[1:02:19] of singing but they've got a way of
[1:02:20] bringing out god in a special way and
[1:02:22] the anointing that comes down with them
[1:02:24] may be different and have a different
[1:02:25] effect but each one is effective because
[1:02:27] they're expressing the word through
[1:02:29] their gift amen it's christ through them
[1:02:32] doing what they're supposed to do
[1:02:34] and then so brother mark can get up here
[1:02:36] and teach in a way that i can't do and
[1:02:38] brother gerald can fall under the
[1:02:39] anointing and get off of his notes maybe
[1:02:41] in a way that i can't do
[1:02:43] amen and we've got the this player and
[1:02:45] that player and all these different
[1:02:46] things and we've got people in the body
[1:02:47] that can do so many different things and
[1:02:49] it doesn't all look the same but yet it
[1:02:50] is all a measure of christ that's being
[1:02:52] expressed in their life amen
[1:02:57] praise the lord
[1:03:00] amen
[1:03:03] the fact is you've got to be able to
[1:03:04] personify the word for your day amen you
[1:03:06] can't leave it on a page
[1:03:09] you want to be able to tell people about
[1:03:12] what's god done for you we're supposed
[1:03:13] to be able to testify without a message
[1:03:14] book in our hand and then we ought to be
[1:03:16] able to point to what god has been doing
[1:03:18] and what we're looking for god to do and
[1:03:19] what we're believing god to do amen that
[1:03:21] we've got to pass god we've got a
[1:03:23] present god and we're believing in a
[1:03:24] future god as well amen we want to be
[1:03:26] able to have people ask us what does god
[1:03:28] mean to you and have an answer for them
[1:03:30] rather than god sent a prophet
[1:03:31] amen it's got to be so much farther
[1:03:33] beyond that amen
[1:03:35] amen noah had to build an ark and get in
[1:03:37] it and that was the word for his day
[1:03:40] guess what moses couldn't build an ark
[1:03:41] and get in it because that wasn't the
[1:03:43] word for his day moses had to go and
[1:03:44] kill a lamb and tell everyone put that
[1:03:46] on the lintel of your doors and if you
[1:03:48] do that then you'll be saved you and
[1:03:49] your household and if you didn't do it
[1:03:51] you didn't get out because you didn't
[1:03:52] obey the word for your day you had to
[1:03:53] personify you couldn't just say yeah
[1:03:55] moses is god's prophet you had to do
[1:03:56] what that prophet said follow his
[1:03:58] instruction and then you were able to go
[1:04:00] out and your firstborn didn't die in
[1:04:01] these things amen abraham had to leave
[1:04:03] his family didn't he the word for
[1:04:05] abraham's day was go out and seek a city
[1:04:07] whose builder maker is god and i'm going
[1:04:09] to give you heirs and it's going to be
[1:04:10] as a sand of the sea by the time i'm
[1:04:12] done with them and i'm going to give you
[1:04:13] a land whose builder maker's not god and
[1:04:16] he had to leave and walk out and that
[1:04:17] was the word for his day and if he
[1:04:18] didn't do that then he wasn't going to
[1:04:19] get the blessing amen but he had to do
[1:04:22] something that was particular to him
[1:04:23] amen so often we're worried about what
[1:04:25] part we're going to play in the body and
[1:04:27] we've forgotten that we've got to make
[1:04:28] sure we're compatible with that body
[1:04:30] first amen we've got to be obedient and
[1:04:31] the first obedience is the new birth
[1:04:33] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:04:35] christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:04:37] the holy spirit amen you make yourself
[1:04:39] compatible and then when you're
[1:04:40] compatible you can fit in when somebody
[1:04:42] has an issue in their body and they need
[1:04:44] an organ transplant or something they
[1:04:45] don't just put anybody's lungs in them
[1:04:47] they don't just put anybody's kidneys in
[1:04:48] them do they they've got to go find a
[1:04:50] match donor somebody that has the same
[1:04:52] system as they do the same blood type as
[1:04:54] they do the same dna structure that's
[1:04:56] close enough to match and then they can
[1:04:58] take that and put it in it's the same
[1:04:59] with the body of christ if somebody
[1:05:00] comes in here without the holy ghost
[1:05:02] though they be gifted they aren't going
[1:05:03] to fit in with the group because you've
[1:05:05] got to have the holy ghost to fit into
[1:05:07] this body paul already said by one
[1:05:09] spirit we're baptized into this body
[1:05:10] that's your access code that's the dna
[1:05:13] that we're looking for that makes you
[1:05:14] compatible with the body of christ amen
[1:05:16] so if you come in and you all of a
[1:05:18] sudden you're saying well why isn't it
[1:05:19] working out maybe you don't have the
[1:05:20] holy ghost or maybe we don't have the
[1:05:22] holy ghost but somebody's got a problem
[1:05:23] there because we've got too much of a
[1:05:25] person there and we don't have enough of
[1:05:26] god in there amen so sometimes we flared
[1:05:29] up in our pride or these different
[1:05:30] things and all of a sudden we're
[1:05:31] incompatible because we've let something
[1:05:33] else put a spirit on us and now we're
[1:05:35] trying to do that and it's not god
[1:05:36] that's working in us amen
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:41] i think today we're at a higher level of
[1:05:43] expression of the word of god than has
[1:05:44] ever been here amen since since the days
[1:05:47] of the of the the acts of the apostles
[1:05:49] this is the highest level of expression
[1:05:51] and guess what we've got to go even
[1:05:52] higher because we've got to go into
[1:05:53] rapture i mean that's the highest levels
[1:05:55] that we walk off this earth without
[1:05:56] seeing death and that's going to take a
[1:05:58] whole lot more commitment from our
[1:05:59] society man it's something i've been
[1:06:01] dwelling on lately is that that that
[1:06:03] push to get some quiet time
[1:06:06] amen where you can just sit still and
[1:06:07] talk to god and let him talk to you and
[1:06:09] that's a real struggle especially those
[1:06:11] of us that have kids and you know you've
[1:06:13] got to give and go and the back and
[1:06:14] forth and these different things it's
[1:06:16] very difficult to get a quiet moment i
[1:06:17] mean in our house half the time we're
[1:06:19] not shut down till quarter to 10 10
[1:06:21] o'clock and you're ready for bed then
[1:06:22] you're trying to say where's the quiet
[1:06:24] time so unless you get up first thing in
[1:06:25] the morning you're not really going to
[1:06:26] get it because the baby only sleeps for
[1:06:28] this long and then you've got to make
[1:06:30] lunch and then you got to make supper
[1:06:31] and you've already had to make breakfast
[1:06:32] and you've got to wash this or brothers
[1:06:34] you're working working working and all
[1:06:36] of a sudden you're saying where's my
[1:06:37] quiet time with god because what we're
[1:06:39] trying to do is if we're trying to
[1:06:40] manifest the word of god for a day we're
[1:06:41] trying to find the will of god for our
[1:06:42] day for each and every one of us and you
[1:06:44] can't find that will just by waltzing
[1:06:46] along and never talking to him and then
[1:06:48] so the closer we get to him the the more
[1:06:50] we're going to see i believe the
[1:06:51] expression of god in our lives because
[1:06:52] we're seeking him more and we're
[1:06:54] quieting ourselves and giving him an
[1:06:56] opportunity to express himself amen amen
[1:06:59] but in the end brother brown says you
[1:07:00] want to be worthy says become one with
[1:07:02] the word for your day
[1:07:06] now i want to touch on the spirit of our
[1:07:07] confession that
[1:07:09] that john talked about here and he says
[1:07:11] in every spirit that confesseth not that
[1:07:14] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[1:07:15] not of god and that is that spirit of
[1:07:17] antichrist wherever you have heard that
[1:07:19] it should come and even now already is
[1:07:22] in the world amen now we want to see
[1:07:24] because he says it's an antichrist
[1:07:25] spirit that says that christ isn't here
[1:07:28] satan can't confess that christ is here
[1:07:30] because if he does he's got a problem
[1:07:31] amen that problem is second corinthians
[1:07:33] 3 it says now
[1:07:36] the lord is that spirit
[1:07:38] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:07:40] there is liberty because what satan is
[1:07:43] an accuser satan is a tormentor satan is
[1:07:46] a binder amen he tries to make you a
[1:07:48] prisoner so if the spirit of christ is
[1:07:50] there saying that christ is here satan
[1:07:52] can't say that because if it does it
[1:07:54] means that he's got to move amen because
[1:07:56] liberty follows the spirit of christ he
[1:07:58] says but we all now listen he's talking
[1:08:00] about paul's talking about liberty and
[1:08:02] we automatically go to you know sickness
[1:08:04] or oppression and these different things
[1:08:05] but listen to what paul says liberty is
[1:08:08] he says but we all with open face
[1:08:10] beholding as in a pla in a glass the
[1:08:13] glory of the lord are changed into the
[1:08:16] same image from glory to glory even as
[1:08:18] by the spirit of the lord so we're
[1:08:20] sitting here and we're saying well satan
[1:08:22] can't buy me satan can't buy me and say
[1:08:24] and paul says what that looks like is
[1:08:26] that you're being changed day by day by
[1:08:28] day amen and you're not being changed
[1:08:30] into something that you've decided but
[1:08:31] you're being changed into the glory that
[1:08:33] god had of you before the foundation of
[1:08:35] the world into that image of the perfect
[1:08:37] son and daughter that he had and that's
[1:08:39] happening a little bit day by day by day
[1:08:41] and satan can't stop it because you're
[1:08:43] in the liberty of the spirit it has
[1:08:45] freedom to move in your life and it
[1:08:47] starts to push satan out a little by
[1:08:49] little by little every day because we're
[1:08:50] sitting here and we're saying well i'm
[1:08:51] filled with the holy ghost yes but
[1:08:53] you're still living in a in two realms
[1:08:55] you've got your your your mind and
[1:08:57] conscience and all these different
[1:08:58] things the spirit realm and the flesh
[1:08:59] realm that are not saved amen so you're
[1:09:02] pushing satan out bit by bit by bit and
[1:09:04] your eyes are being opened so that you
[1:09:05] can start to see that word coming
[1:09:07] through and as it comes through then you
[1:09:09] step on that up to the next one and the
[1:09:11] next one and the next one and all of a
[1:09:12] sudden satan doesn't have any power in
[1:09:14] that area of your life because you've
[1:09:15] been feeding on the word and you start
[1:09:17] to see it break through and then you say
[1:09:18] hey that's me in there
[1:09:20] that's me that's a word coming forth and
[1:09:22] all of a sudden satan has to go because
[1:09:24] you're saying christ is being manifested
[1:09:26] once more in my life satan you've got to
[1:09:27] go and the thing is once you start to
[1:09:29] see it coming it's like a baby once that
[1:09:31] baby's coming it's not going back and
[1:09:32] once the word of god you start to see
[1:09:34] that appearing your faith quickens and
[1:09:36] all of a sudden you start to say here it
[1:09:37] goes and you know it's done and satan's
[1:09:39] got to move so if he says christ is here
[1:09:41] he's got to move because there's a
[1:09:43] change that happens when christ is in
[1:09:44] our midst statement there's a presence
[1:09:46] that pushes him out and he can't stay on
[1:09:48] your property anymore
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:52] amen they can't confess it because the
[1:09:54] minute they do then the title indeed it
[1:09:56] starts to get read amen because the holy
[1:09:58] ghost is your token that's your proof
[1:10:00] that you own what you're talking about
[1:10:01] and as soon as you hold that up he's got
[1:10:03] to move and then as soon as you tell him
[1:10:05] i've got a right to this because the
[1:10:07] word says it and that word has been
[1:10:08] quickened by the holy spirit in your
[1:10:10] life all of a sudden those demons can't
[1:10:12] bind you anymore because what the
[1:10:14] presence of the lord is there and it's
[1:10:15] bringing liberty into you and it's
[1:10:16] changing you into what he has said you
[1:10:18] are going to be amen paul says live
[1:10:20] worthy of it but he doesn't say you're
[1:10:22] there but he says when the spirit of the
[1:10:23] lord is there then it's going to make
[1:10:25] you worthy it's going to make you into
[1:10:27] what he said you were going to be amen
[1:10:30] what is the part of being worthy it's to
[1:10:32] be the image that god had for you before
[1:10:34] the foundation of the world amen amen
[1:10:37] you're going to have a role in the local
[1:10:38] body and we'll get into that later but
[1:10:40] the point is to be what god has called
[1:10:41] you to be what is it the marines be all
[1:10:43] that you can be is that it blanca the
[1:10:45] marines be all that you can be or is it
[1:10:46] army or air force whatever it is you
[1:10:48] know they have a slogan be all that you
[1:10:49] can be well paul's saying be all that
[1:10:51] you can be but not that you can be but
[1:10:53] be all that he said you are going to be
[1:10:55] amen just step into it and feed that and
[1:10:57] feed that and feed that and see that
[1:10:58] liberty that comes in the spirit that
[1:11:00] brings a change in your life and you
[1:11:01] start to see christ be manifested every
[1:11:03] day amen
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:06] you can't be changed into that image of
[1:11:08] satan has you bound that's for certain
[1:11:09] amen you can't serve god and mammon you
[1:11:11] can't be two things at the same time you
[1:11:12] can't be in liberty and be bound at the
[1:11:14] same time amen so if christ is in there
[1:11:16] and the spirit of god is working then
[1:11:18] liberty is going to happen and those
[1:11:19] chains are going to be broken they have
[1:11:20] to be
[1:11:24] amen first john 4 verse 4. this is the
[1:11:27] continuation this is this is remember
[1:11:29] he's talking about the spirit that
[1:11:31] confesses that jesus christ is come
[1:11:34] he says what ye are of god little
[1:11:36] children and have overcome them because
[1:11:39] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:11:40] that is in the world he did not say you
[1:11:42] will overcome
[1:11:44] he doesn't say you are overcoming he
[1:11:45] says you have overcome he says this is a
[1:11:48] finished work this is past tense in the
[1:11:50] eyes of god standing there in eternity
[1:11:52] this is a finished work the word has
[1:11:53] already been spoken he's already seen a
[1:11:55] bride prepared for her husband
[1:11:58] you've already done it and then he's
[1:11:59] already prepared a a reward for the
[1:12:01] overcomer of every single age we're in
[1:12:03] the last stage he's already said there's
[1:12:04] going to be people there so he says look
[1:12:06] you've already overcome him and the one
[1:12:09] that's in you is the one that did that
[1:12:10] overcoming the one that is in you is the
[1:12:12] one that's doing it in time today amen
[1:12:14] there is no potential failure or
[1:12:16] potential loss is what he's saying
[1:12:17] there's nothing going to stop this from
[1:12:19] happening you already have overcome
[1:12:21] satan
[1:12:22] it's a finished work it's a finished
[1:12:24] work there's nothing going to stop it
[1:12:25] the book's already been written the
[1:12:27] book's already been written if we could
[1:12:29] just recognize that and say lord why am
[1:12:31] i holding back why am i questioning the
[1:12:33] book's already been written all i've got
[1:12:35] to do is read the book and get the faith
[1:12:37] that's in the book and all of a sudden
[1:12:39] it'll start happening in my life amen
[1:12:40] what is it faith comes by hearing and
[1:12:42] hearing comes by the word faith comes by
[1:12:44] understanding the will of god and that
[1:12:45] understanding comes always by the word
[1:12:48] it's got to be in line with the word and
[1:12:49] when we do that it's going to be
[1:12:51] quickening that faith and we have that
[1:12:52] overcoming power in our lives amen
[1:12:55] or john doesn't say you are going to be
[1:12:57] an overcomer he says you already are an
[1:12:59] overcomer even when you're in the battle
[1:13:01] today you already are an overcomer
[1:13:04] hallelujah amen
[1:13:06] this is a the the famous quote that says
[1:13:09] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[1:13:11] every one of his tricks now a lot of
[1:13:13] people say there's no devil it's just a
[1:13:14] thought don't you believe that there is
[1:13:16] a real devil he's just as real as you or
[1:13:18] anybody a real devil and you must
[1:13:20] recognize him as real you must know he's
[1:13:22] a devil then the same time that you
[1:13:24] recognize him and know that he's a devil
[1:13:26] and he's against you then to overcome
[1:13:28] you must recognize that the god in you
[1:13:31] is greater you got to recognize that
[1:13:32] god's in you you've got to be that's why
[1:13:34] i said you have to make sure you're
[1:13:35] compatible you've got to know that
[1:13:37] you've got the holy spirit if you don't
[1:13:39] know it then satan's going to walk all
[1:13:40] over you every single day but if you
[1:13:42] have the holy spirit then you know that
[1:13:44] god has not only commissioned you not
[1:13:46] only that he has chosen you but he has
[1:13:48] put the power inside of you to take the
[1:13:50] word and push out satan in every one of
[1:13:51] his attempts amen he says you must
[1:13:54] recognize that the god in you is greater
[1:13:56] and mightier than he is that the one
[1:13:59] that's in you has already overcome him
[1:14:01] so we are fighting a defeated enemy amen
[1:14:04] they say the best thing that you can do
[1:14:05] if you if you have an opponent is do
[1:14:07] what break his confidence if he doesn't
[1:14:10] think he can win he won't win even if
[1:14:12] he's bigger faster stronger meaner if he
[1:14:14] doesn't have confidence he's going to
[1:14:15] win he's going to lose amen and so what
[1:14:18] brother branham's saying here is he's
[1:14:19] saying he is already defeated his
[1:14:21] confidence has been shaken and that's
[1:14:23] why he's trying to bluff you he's trying
[1:14:25] to look bigger and badder than he is
[1:14:26] because he knows that if you recognize
[1:14:28] that he is defeated and the very one who
[1:14:30] defeated him is in you right now
[1:14:33] then you're not going to have any
[1:14:34] problems moving forward because you're
[1:14:36] facing a defeated enemy amen he's been
[1:14:38] defeated by christ already and now
[1:14:40] christ is in you again rising up and
[1:14:42] he'll defeat him every single time
[1:14:44] amen he says and by his grace you are
[1:14:47] more than a match for him amen that's
[1:14:49] real overcoming when you recognize when
[1:14:51] you recognize you have the holy spirit
[1:14:53] when you recognize that his word is for
[1:14:55] you and you recognize that his promises
[1:14:57] are for you he says when you recognize
[1:14:59] that he is in you today to make those
[1:15:01] happen that's when you've got real
[1:15:03] overcoming
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:06] amen notice here he says tricks
[1:15:08] i was talking to somebody earlier tricks
[1:15:10] are not black and white
[1:15:12] tricks are nearly white
[1:15:14] amen we look around and we aren't going
[1:15:16] to be fooled by denominational preaching
[1:15:18] we're not going to be fooled by signing
[1:15:19] our name on a book or this set and the
[1:15:21] other thing what we'll be fooled by is
[1:15:23] one word off
[1:15:24] that's what we've got to watch that's
[1:15:25] why we've got to know the scriptures
[1:15:27] that's why we don't just read quotes
[1:15:28] over a pulpit because the quotes can be
[1:15:30] twisted so easily that's why i don't
[1:15:32] just read run scripture to preach a
[1:15:34] sermon generally because if you can pull
[1:15:36] it from genesis to revelation if you can
[1:15:38] pull it through multiple scriptures
[1:15:39] you'll get the straightness of it you'll
[1:15:41] get the truth of it amen so we've got to
[1:15:43] what know the word so that we recognize
[1:15:45] when it's off by one bit because satan
[1:15:47] like i said he's happy if you can
[1:15:48] recognize the god of yesterday or two
[1:15:50] thousand years ago these different
[1:15:52] things but the minute you put it in
[1:15:53] today he's going to say well why don't
[1:15:54] we wait till tomorrow for that
[1:15:56] right why don't we wait for that
[1:16:00] and there is a time of waiting that god
[1:16:01] has right to develop character i'm not
[1:16:02] getting that but what satan's trying to
[1:16:04] do is when you're trying to kick him off
[1:16:06] your property he's going to say
[1:16:08] it's a lot of work for today why don't
[1:16:10] we just listen i'll back up a little bit
[1:16:12] right he's going to want you to
[1:16:14] compromise a little bit so that he can
[1:16:16] stick around just a little bit longer
[1:16:18] amen but if the word says resist them
[1:16:20] and he'll flee amen we don't give up
[1:16:22] because he said okay i'll give you a
[1:16:24] break no no we keep pushing until he's
[1:16:26] completely gone amen
[1:16:28] satan will settle at getting you off the
[1:16:30] word of god by one word every single
[1:16:31] time if he can get you off one word
[1:16:33] today and one word tomorrow and one day
[1:16:34] the next then pretty soon by the end
[1:16:36] you're going to be off by degrees and
[1:16:37] then your gun will never hit the target
[1:16:39] amen and what your discernment will be
[1:16:41] now twisted all up and you won't have a
[1:16:42] clue about where you stand who you are
[1:16:44] what you're supposed to be doing or what
[1:16:45] your rights are
[1:16:46] amen
[1:16:49] first john 4. now he says he's talking
[1:16:51] about the ones that don't confess that
[1:16:53] christ has come in the flesh he says
[1:16:54] they are of the world therefore speak
[1:16:56] they of the world and the world hears
[1:16:58] them amen if somebody has a great
[1:17:00] following in the world i can guarantee
[1:17:02] you one thing it ain't the holy ghost
[1:17:03] speaking
[1:17:04] that's what he's saying he's saying if
[1:17:05] the world accepts him it's not the holy
[1:17:07] ghost
[1:17:08] we are of god he that knoweth god
[1:17:11] heareth us that's a powerful thing
[1:17:16] says you'll hear me if you've got the
[1:17:17] holy ghost
[1:17:19] he that is not of god heareth not us now
[1:17:21] let me say it this way
[1:17:23] if the same holy spirit that was in paul
[1:17:26] would not be heard by the world then why
[1:17:27] are you expecting the world to hear you
[1:17:29] every time
[1:17:30] let me put it this way if you got the
[1:17:32] holy ghost the world shouldn't be able
[1:17:33] to hear you and agree with it
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:37] you're not going to be able to go on
[1:17:38] social media you're not going to be able
[1:17:39] to go into your workplace and expect
[1:17:41] everyone to agree with you in fact if
[1:17:42] you can get one to agree with you in any
[1:17:44] way it's a miracle but in no way are you
[1:17:46] going to get the whole group to accept
[1:17:47] what you have to say why because they
[1:17:49] are of another spirit
[1:17:51] he says hereby he says if somebody will
[1:17:54] hear you they're of god and if somebody
[1:17:55] won't hear you they're not he says
[1:17:57] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[1:17:59] the spirit of error amen
[1:18:02] simple isn't it
[1:18:04] god help us to make sure that what we
[1:18:06] give is the pure straight word amen that
[1:18:09] we don't twist it to our own desires
[1:18:11] that we don't twist it to our own
[1:18:12] thinkings that we don't twist it to this
[1:18:14] idea or this thought or this book or
[1:18:16] this person that we're sitting under but
[1:18:17] that it flows through completely through
[1:18:19] the holy spirit dead straight through
[1:18:21] the word of god every single time amen
[1:18:23] because we've got to be able to be read
[1:18:25] and then paul said you are our epistles
[1:18:27] known and read of all men they've got to
[1:18:28] be able to read us and get the truth
[1:18:30] from us without having read maybe even
[1:18:32] the very word or message that we have
[1:18:33] for this day amen
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:38] going back to the first verse
[1:18:41] ephesians 4 1 says i therefore the
[1:18:43] prisoner of the lord beseech you that
[1:18:44] you walk worthy of the vocation where
[1:18:46] with your call now i want you in verse 2
[1:18:48] it says with all lowliness and meekness
[1:18:51] with long suffering for bearing one
[1:18:52] another in love now guess what if it was
[1:18:54] something that we would naturally do
[1:18:56] paul wouldn't have to tell us would he
[1:18:58] right in our flesh if this was something
[1:19:00] that we could do naturally and easily
[1:19:02] paul wouldn't write it down here because
[1:19:03] he'd say this this is something that
[1:19:04] everyone does but paul says look in
[1:19:06] walking worthy and living a worthy life
[1:19:09] in in living up to the vocation and
[1:19:11] living up to what christ has called you
[1:19:13] to be he says do it with all lowliness
[1:19:15] and meekness with long suffering
[1:19:18] forbearing one another in love he's
[1:19:20] warning us to be meek and be patient
[1:19:22] with each other because satan's going to
[1:19:24] try and come in and disrupt it amen that
[1:19:26] he's going to try and cause
[1:19:27] disfellowship and break up the unity
[1:19:30] verse 3 it says endeavoring to keep the
[1:19:32] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:19:34] now endeavoring means trying and trying
[1:19:37] and trying and trying we say trying i
[1:19:40] tried
[1:19:41] no no no endeavoring means you try and
[1:19:43] you try and you try and you try well i
[1:19:45] said i was sorry how many times did you
[1:19:47] say you were sorry keep saying you're
[1:19:49] story keep doing what you need to do to
[1:19:51] keep what the unity of the spirit and
[1:19:53] the bond of peace you keep pushing and
[1:19:55] pushing and pushing to restore
[1:19:57] fellowship to restore unity to keep
[1:19:59] things moving in the right direction as
[1:20:01] brother mark says we're all on the boat
[1:20:02] china so let's keep it headed on the
[1:20:04] road to china amen we're not going to
[1:20:06] china okay
[1:20:08] but it it's it's a metaphor right
[1:20:10] brother merc that's right
[1:20:12] so he says what doing everything that
[1:20:14] you can do
[1:20:16] to make sure that there is no disunity
[1:20:18] in the body
[1:20:19] everything you can do that's a high
[1:20:21] standard because how many of us are
[1:20:23] doing everything we can do how many of
[1:20:25] us have done a lot and stopped short and
[1:20:27] said that's enough
[1:20:29] no no he says endeavoring a continuous
[1:20:31] trying a continuous doing a continuous
[1:20:34] putting yourself keeping yourself low
[1:20:36] and meek
[1:20:38] until that unity is restored amen
[1:20:42] like i said before if you don't have a
[1:20:43] weapon in your hand they don't need one
[1:20:45] in theirs and then if you'll drop the
[1:20:46] attitude then they'll drop their
[1:20:48] attitude
[1:20:49] and then when you when somebody wants to
[1:20:50] fight and you say hey that's a great
[1:20:52] shirt you've got on where'd you get that
[1:20:54] all of a sudden they don't want to fight
[1:20:55] you anymore do they
[1:20:57] because you've distracted them because
[1:20:58] you're not you're not saying yeah yeah
[1:20:59] bring it on buddy you're saying hey i
[1:21:01] like i like you i like what you have
[1:21:03] where'd you get it i'd like one of those
[1:21:04] they're not going to pound your face in
[1:21:06] with that are they going to say
[1:21:09] right they got nothing because you're
[1:21:11] not flaring up back at them
[1:21:13] endeavoring means you'll do whatever it
[1:21:14] takes amen
[1:21:16] and that's why you need to be meek and
[1:21:18] lowly
[1:21:19] because you can't be prideful in these
[1:21:20] situations amen
[1:21:23] verse
[1:21:24] four
[1:21:25] there is one body
[1:21:26] and one spirit even as you are called in
[1:21:29] one hope of your calling
[1:21:31] one lord one faith one baptism one god
[1:21:33] and father of all who is above all and
[1:21:35] through all and in you all remember
[1:21:37] remember we talked about a compatible
[1:21:39] body that means we've all got the holy
[1:21:40] spirit so he says you've got one body
[1:21:42] spirit hope lord faith baptism god and
[1:21:44] father it's all one is what he's saying
[1:21:46] so why are we fighting
[1:21:49] right why is there disunity he's saying
[1:21:50] if it's all if we've all got the holy
[1:21:52] spirit if we're all on the same boat to
[1:21:54] china if we're all trying to get to the
[1:21:55] same place then why is there this issue
[1:21:58] he says watch out because what's going
[1:21:59] to happen is you're going to try to make
[1:22:00] it about yours and mine about you and me
[1:22:03] about the pastors and the churches about
[1:22:05] the deacons about the trustees we're
[1:22:07] going to try and draw divisions into
[1:22:08] there and make it like each one has
[1:22:10] their own little part of the of the
[1:22:12] puzzle and the pie he says no no no it's
[1:22:14] all one it's all one so keep focused on
[1:22:17] keeping it as one hey man if you want to
[1:22:19] walk worthy you're going to keep
[1:22:20] focusing on bringing it all together
[1:22:22] rather than excluding and drawing lines
[1:22:24] in the midst of you amen
[1:22:27] and then paul gives us a but
[1:22:30] because this is where a lot of times the
[1:22:31] divisions come in he says but unto every
[1:22:34] one of us is given grace according to
[1:22:37] the measure of the gift of christ
[1:22:40] now this we're going to spend some time
[1:22:41] on on sunday
[1:22:43] by god's grace but listen to this in
[1:22:45] verse the amplified it says yet god's
[1:22:47] grace god's unmerited favor was given to
[1:22:49] each of us individually not
[1:22:52] indiscriminately but in different ways
[1:22:53] what he's saying there is that it wasn't
[1:22:55] given haphazardly one person doesn't
[1:22:57] have a gift and another person have a
[1:22:58] different gift because god just took a
[1:22:59] confetti of gifts and threw them out and
[1:23:01] whoever it landed on was what they got
[1:23:03] no no it says god gave them to us with
[1:23:06] specificity he gave it with purpose he
[1:23:08] gave it with a plan he gave it with an
[1:23:10] intention behind it for it to be used
[1:23:13] for his will amen he says each one of us
[1:23:15] is given
[1:23:17] what in proportion to the measure of
[1:23:19] christ's gifts what he's saying is each
[1:23:20] one of us is given grace
[1:23:23] that is in proportion or equal to or
[1:23:25] based on the gift that he has given us
[1:23:27] amen so in other words god's given grace
[1:23:29] to each of us and he's given more grace
[1:23:32] to some and less to others and it's
[1:23:34] based on your specific calling within
[1:23:35] the bride because what happens so often
[1:23:38] so what he's doing here is he's matching
[1:23:40] your grace to what you're called to do
[1:23:42] and it's grace given to you that's going
[1:23:45] to allow you to do what he has called
[1:23:47] you to do amen some of us have easier
[1:23:48] roads than others
[1:23:50] right
[1:23:51] look around we've got people that have
[1:23:53] different health problems different
[1:23:54] financial situations different job
[1:23:56] situations difficult spouses
[1:24:00] no no no no that's not true
[1:24:02] i made that up but each one of us has
[1:24:04] different situations don't we and you
[1:24:06] look around and you'd say man i'm so
[1:24:08] glad i'm not them or i really wish i was
[1:24:10] them maybe in some cases
[1:24:12] right
[1:24:13] but each one has been given grace for
[1:24:15] the path that they're going to walk down
[1:24:16] and the gifts that god has placed in
[1:24:18] their life to do what help them get
[1:24:19] through it and help others as well
[1:24:21] amen the more difficult the road the
[1:24:23] greater the grace that's what's paul
[1:24:25] that's what he's saying here amen amen
[1:24:27] the greater the gift the greater the
[1:24:29] grace required
[1:24:31] now that's a serious thing because we
[1:24:33] sit there and we get puffed up oh you
[1:24:35] know be big
[1:24:37] and he says no no no if you're going to
[1:24:39] be great in god's eyes if you've got a
[1:24:40] great gift of god you have to have more
[1:24:43] grace than anyone else to be greater
[1:24:45] than anyone else in that gift area
[1:24:47] you've got to have more grace amen moses
[1:24:49] was the meekest man
[1:24:50] and we know that because he wrote it
[1:24:54] but he wrote it under the anointing of
[1:24:55] the holy spirit
[1:24:57] amen moses could walk in
[1:25:00] they had a question moses could say wait
[1:25:03] here he'd go in the back room he'd say
[1:25:05] god what about this god would say here's
[1:25:06] what you say to him and he'd walk out
[1:25:08] and he'd say it that's how close moses
[1:25:10] was to god amen until christ came there
[1:25:13] was no man that had that sort of
[1:25:14] closeness now john the baptist was said
[1:25:16] to be the greatest prophet except for
[1:25:17] christ but when it comes to a
[1:25:19] manifestation of a gift and a closeness
[1:25:21] with god moses is the only one that had
[1:25:23] that
[1:25:24] moses could literally walk in ask god a
[1:25:26] question and come back five minutes
[1:25:28] later and he'd have the answer for you
[1:25:30] that's the he was god to the people
[1:25:32] that's what moses was that's how close
[1:25:34] it was was that god said you be god
[1:25:37] how many of us would want that what he's
[1:25:40] saying is if you want to be god to the
[1:25:42] people you're going to have more grace
[1:25:43] than anybody i've got to give you more
[1:25:45] grace one that they'll accept you in
[1:25:46] that role and two that you won't get
[1:25:48] lifted up in pride or twisted and turn
[1:25:50] it into something of your own will and
[1:25:52] your own making and get it all scrupled
[1:25:54] up as brother adam talks about amen the
[1:25:56] greater the gift the greater the calling
[1:25:58] the greater the responsibility the
[1:26:00] meeker we ought to be is what he's
[1:26:01] saying here amen why because we've
[1:26:03] received grace
[1:26:05] amen remember paul says did the word
[1:26:07] come to you or did the word come from
[1:26:08] you amen did the gift come from you or
[1:26:10] did was the gift given to you is what
[1:26:12] he's saying you don't do anything to
[1:26:13] have these gifts it is a gift of god and
[1:26:16] there is grace that comes with it to
[1:26:18] help you to operate that according to
[1:26:20] god's purpose amen amen
[1:26:23] sometimes we see gifted people and we
[1:26:25] think they've got more of god than i've
[1:26:26] got
[1:26:28] you ever think that
[1:26:30] preachers do it a lot
[1:26:32] they see a powerful preacher they say
[1:26:33] wow he's got he's got so much more than
[1:26:35] i have
[1:26:36] so much more of this and so much more of
[1:26:38] that you know what they have more grace
[1:26:40] that's what paul's telling you they
[1:26:42] don't have more god they've got more
[1:26:43] grace and that grace is there to push
[1:26:46] them back and let god operate through
[1:26:48] them in a more powerful way and so it's
[1:26:50] not that they have necessarily sat down
[1:26:52] and and cried on their knees and fasted
[1:26:54] and prayed and this and that the other
[1:26:55] thing it's purely the grace of god
[1:26:57] that's brought them to that place amen
[1:26:59] amen if they can if they can continue
[1:27:02] with a gift so great without turning it
[1:27:04] into pride and arrogance that's grace
[1:27:06] amen
[1:27:08] next verse paul says wherefore he saith
[1:27:11] when he ascended up on high he led
[1:27:13] captivity captive and gave gifts on
[1:27:15] demand amen we'll talk about that in a
[1:27:17] later purpose amen but when he talked
[1:27:19] about the the being worthy of our
[1:27:21] vocation he talked about that focus
[1:27:23] we've talked about singleness of purpose
[1:27:25] remember with joshua and these different
[1:27:26] men is that when they got the go they
[1:27:28] went and they didn't stop until they
[1:27:31] were done and then they went and they
[1:27:32] went and they went and all they did was
[1:27:34] what god had told them to do to step
[1:27:36] into what god had told them to be and
[1:27:38] they pushed and they pushed and they
[1:27:39] pushed and they fought and they fought
[1:27:40] they fought joshua didn't take a break
[1:27:41] in 10 years while he was conquering
[1:27:43] canaan and then he went and he went and
[1:27:45] he went until he'd done what god had
[1:27:46] told him to do amen
[1:27:48] paul himself remember he stood before
[1:27:50] agrippa and he says what i was not
[1:27:51] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[1:27:53] right he says i've done everything that
[1:27:55] he told me to do since he knocked me off
[1:27:57] my horse right and that's what we've got
[1:27:59] to be able to say when we stand before
[1:28:00] him like that good and faithful servant
[1:28:02] amen is that you told me what to do and
[1:28:04] i took it and i multiplied it and i made
[1:28:06] something out of it beyond what you gave
[1:28:07] me
[1:28:08] deuteronomy 6 5 says this and thou shalt
[1:28:11] love the lord thy god with all thine
[1:28:13] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[1:28:16] thy mind might amen that's what we're
[1:28:18] talking about
[1:28:19] bonk and i've been talking the last
[1:28:20] little while about how the true church
[1:28:22] really only uh it really only flourishes
[1:28:25] under persecution
[1:28:27] you know and that's when you start
[1:28:28] seeking god in a way is when you've got
[1:28:30] a need that you can't meet by working
[1:28:32] harder you know you can't put money in
[1:28:34] the bank when you don't have a job and
[1:28:35] if you don't have a job you can't make
[1:28:37] ends meet and all of a sudden we start
[1:28:38] praying real hard don't we amen when the
[1:28:40] doctors have thrown up their hands
[1:28:42] and said you've got three months to live
[1:28:45] what do we do we get on our knees that's
[1:28:47] persecution we just don't realize it
[1:28:49] sometimes that satanic persecution is
[1:28:51] what that is but we also have political
[1:28:53] persecution and then when you look at
[1:28:54] the the the alternative lifestyles
[1:28:56] they're trying to cram down our throat
[1:28:57] the mess they're making of our education
[1:28:59] system the financial mess that they're
[1:29:01] making of the countries
[1:29:02] and then everything is going to be
[1:29:04] putting pressure on us bit by bit by bit
[1:29:06] and the point is to get us to where we
[1:29:08] stop looking to ourselves stop looking
[1:29:10] to ease in comfort of life and say lord
[1:29:12] you know what why don't we just get out
[1:29:14] of here
[1:29:15] amen and it's that persecution as
[1:29:17] brother mark talked about in spirit
[1:29:18] warfare what do you say we've got 200
[1:29:20] million demons that were released out of
[1:29:22] the river euphrates and they went and
[1:29:23] they persecuted the jews and then when
[1:29:25] that work was done because it was a it
[1:29:27] was an allowance of god now they turn
[1:29:29] their attention to who the bride amen
[1:29:31] and that persecution has got to come on
[1:29:33] us and it's going to come from every
[1:29:34] facet and many even from within the
[1:29:36] churches we've seen with you know
[1:29:37] believe the sign of these different
[1:29:38] things we see it from within we see it
[1:29:40] from without politically spiritually
[1:29:42] religiously economically uh in your jobs
[1:29:44] all these different things we see that
[1:29:45] pressure coming on us and what is it
[1:29:47] it's the holy spirit trying to get us to
[1:29:49] move to a place where we will surrender
[1:29:51] more and look to get out of here and say
[1:29:53] lord whatever it takes do it because i'm
[1:29:55] ready to go now
[1:29:57] we're easily tied down here
[1:29:59] even when we're living clean sanctified
[1:30:00] lives we're still easily tied down here
[1:30:03] guess what if nothing changed for the
[1:30:04] next 50 years i would live a very
[1:30:06] comfortable life there'd be no pressure
[1:30:08] on me to get out even though i want to
[1:30:10] get out amen there's got to become a
[1:30:12] greater and greater desire i believe and
[1:30:14] with that will then come a greater and
[1:30:15] greater sanctification with that will
[1:30:17] come a greater and greater seeking of
[1:30:18] god will be spending more time with him
[1:30:20] there has to be an impetus there must be
[1:30:22] something that's pushing us to do these
[1:30:23] things because as humanity we fall back
[1:30:25] to the easiest life that we can live and
[1:30:26] still get what we need to amen
[1:30:28] amen we just look at our no nobody that
[1:30:31] the ones that that go way harder than
[1:30:32] they need to are the other millionaires
[1:30:34] and billionaires amongst us
[1:30:36] and they lack a moral conscience usually
[1:30:38] right but the ones that go harder than
[1:30:40] they have to those are the ones that get
[1:30:41] rich the rest of us usually just make
[1:30:43] ends meet and we'll stay there we'll
[1:30:44] stay there forever forever forever and
[1:30:46] it's the same often with their spiritual
[1:30:47] life is as long as we can say i'm
[1:30:49] blessed i'm doing good and dirt today
[1:30:51] today and i don't feel convicted
[1:30:53] then we say well everything's good but
[1:30:55] see god's not looking for us to stay
[1:30:56] stagnant because that's what it'd be
[1:30:58] he's looking for us to grow amen as we
[1:30:59] read from glory to glory he's changing
[1:31:01] us into that image amen and with that
[1:31:03] means there's got to come pressure amen
[1:31:05] it's going to be pushing us to do what
[1:31:07] seek god's face more and more in our
[1:31:08] lives
[1:31:11] this was in the sermon that
[1:31:13] brother joe played a while back by faith
[1:31:15] moses and this one just jumped right out
[1:31:17] of me this is this is uh
[1:31:19] pharaoh speaking to moses he said you
[1:31:21] can just go a few days
[1:31:23] and you go stay in the land sure he
[1:31:24] knowed they'd be back then he found out
[1:31:26] that wouldn't work so he thought
[1:31:27] something different he says i'll tell
[1:31:28] you what you do you go on out anywhere
[1:31:30] you want to go but you leave all your
[1:31:32] wives all your children all your cattle
[1:31:33] back here you leave them here and you go
[1:31:35] out because he know they have
[1:31:37] possessions back there that would lure
[1:31:38] them back
[1:31:41] that's what the devil says to you just
[1:31:44] as long as you leave some of the things
[1:31:45] of the world hanging on you you still
[1:31:47] want to smoke you want to drink you want
[1:31:49] to dress like the world that's as good
[1:31:50] as the devil wants
[1:31:52] he says i hear so much about backsliding
[1:31:54] i don't believe there's so much
[1:31:56] backsliding as people think there are
[1:31:58] they just leave too many possessions in
[1:32:00] egypt to lure them back that's all amen
[1:32:04] backslidings are not what they say it is
[1:32:06] you left too much of the world back
[1:32:08] there and that lures you
[1:32:10] says you still got something to pull you
[1:32:11] back every time
[1:32:13] he says brother i tell you when israel
[1:32:15] got ready at midnight they had
[1:32:17] everything they had in this world packed
[1:32:19] up and ready to go
[1:32:21] anything that was worth taking they were
[1:32:22] taking it
[1:32:24] god sent us a revival like that we pack
[1:32:26] up everything and get ready to go the
[1:32:28] midnight cry is coming go you out to
[1:32:30] meet him you better have everything
[1:32:32] packed up you better not have nothing
[1:32:34] this world luring you back any strings
[1:32:37] to hold you down he says pack up let's
[1:32:39] get ready we're going
[1:32:41] like i said it's what i've been dwelling
[1:32:43] on lately is just that idea that i need
[1:32:45] to spend more time in prayer i mean i
[1:32:47] need to spend more quiet time i need to
[1:32:48] give quality time to him that i haven't
[1:32:50] been giving we've always got more time
[1:32:52] to give and what we find is satan will
[1:32:54] try and fill it up every time and then
[1:32:56] you get a break and all of a sudden he's
[1:32:57] got an idea he's got a thought he's got
[1:32:58] an interest he's got a hobby he's got a
[1:33:00] question a concern whatever it might be
[1:33:03] right and he's got something to fill
[1:33:04] that up but we've got to push that back
[1:33:06] and then and say no no no i need
[1:33:08] strength for the battle i need to step
[1:33:09] up i mean there's something inside of me
[1:33:11] that says i need more of god i need more
[1:33:13] faith and then i need more revelation i
[1:33:15] need more understanding of what god
[1:33:16] wants me to do and be and so i'm going
[1:33:18] to keep seeking him and then i believe
[1:33:19] he'll i'll find what i have need of amen
[1:33:22] but says this
[1:33:24] he says the thing of it is today we've
[1:33:25] got too much bypassing and doing other
[1:33:27] things
[1:33:28] and let's get to the mark is he god or
[1:33:31] isn't he god
[1:33:34] is he the same yesterday today and
[1:33:35] forever or isn't he the same
[1:33:38] is he still jesus
[1:33:40] is he raised from the dead
[1:33:42] has he raised if he hasn't then forget
[1:33:44] it
[1:33:46] amen do we serve a risen christ and is
[1:33:48] he living today is he the present christ
[1:33:50] with us
[1:33:51] he says if he has let's get our
[1:33:53] enthusiasm started let's get filled with
[1:33:56] his spirit get to praying and start a
[1:33:58] meeting
[1:33:59] do something
[1:34:01] amen remember we're talking about a
[1:34:03] worthy life and that means we've got to
[1:34:04] find god's path for our lives each and
[1:34:07] every one of us amen i'm not looking to
[1:34:08] my own worthiness amen but i want to
[1:34:10] bring something to him amen i want to
[1:34:12] have something to say you gave me
[1:34:13] something and i want to do something
[1:34:15] with it amen i don't want to have the
[1:34:16] holy ghost and walk in with just me amen
[1:34:18] i want to bring in other brothers and
[1:34:20] sisters of like precious faith with me
[1:34:21] amen i want to be able to have jewels on
[1:34:23] the crown that i can offer to him i
[1:34:25] don't just want the crown that he gives
[1:34:26] me but i want something that i've added
[1:34:28] in there based on what he gave me amen i
[1:34:30] don't want to go to heaven i don't want
[1:34:32] to go to christ empty hand today man i
[1:34:34] want to have something that i can lay
[1:34:35] down at his feet when i get there and
[1:34:37] it's not going to be anything of my
[1:34:38] doing it's got to be something that he's
[1:34:39] inspired in our lives amen
[1:34:42] but the rap says we look for christ to
[1:34:43] appear the same jesus
[1:34:45] he said when he was on earth a little
[1:34:47] while in the world seeth me no more yet
[1:34:49] you shall see me for i'll be with you to
[1:34:51] the end of the world that same one who
[1:34:53] could direct the word and be the word
[1:34:55] and direct it right straight onto the
[1:34:56] target that same lord jesus is here
[1:34:58] moving this morning in the form of the
[1:35:01] holy spirit to direct our thoughts and
[1:35:03] focus down his word to one true and
[1:35:06] living god to one purpose to one
[1:35:09] achievement
[1:35:10] and if we'll just let him do it he will
[1:35:13] focus the word right into a place
[1:35:15] that'll prove he's the same yesterday
[1:35:18] today and forever
[1:35:20] he says it depends on what you want to
[1:35:22] look at
[1:35:23] we must focus our lives not what
[1:35:26] somebody else says but focused our lives
[1:35:28] to him and here's the word see if we get
[1:35:31] our lives lined with the word then the
[1:35:33] word and our life becomes the same he
[1:35:35] says if you abide in me and my word in
[1:35:37] you then you ask what you will it'll be
[1:35:39] granted to you verily i say unto you if
[1:35:41] you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:35:43] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:35:45] that what you have said will come to
[1:35:46] pass you can have what you said
[1:35:49] oh my not what i said what you said you
[1:35:52] can have because you and he become the
[1:35:55] same because the mind that was in christ
[1:35:57] is in you and the mind that was in
[1:35:59] christ was to fulfill the father's word
[1:36:03] which he was the word there you are then
[1:36:06] you and the word are focused in together
[1:36:09] you become a living unit of god
[1:36:15] you become a living unit of god and then
[1:36:17] he says how great
[1:36:20] what a place
[1:36:22] you become a living unit of god listen
[1:36:24] you are a living unit of god you just
[1:36:26] don't realize it maybe some days
[1:36:28] amen and each day we're looking for that
[1:36:30] to be revealed more and more and more is
[1:36:32] lord what is that portion of the word
[1:36:33] what is that portion of christ that you
[1:36:35] want me to express to my life amen
[1:36:37] listen before his translation what is
[1:36:39] the rapture of revelation
[1:36:41] enoch's revelation was what it says
[1:36:44] scripture says before his translation
[1:36:46] he had this revelation that he pleased
[1:36:49] god
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:51] can you look in your life and say i
[1:36:53] please god
[1:36:55] can you look at what you're doing today
[1:36:56] and say lord i know for a fact that what
[1:36:59] i'm doing is pleasing you
[1:37:02] now some of us are older and we've got
[1:37:04] to be able to look back and say that's
[1:37:07] been my path all along it's never too
[1:37:09] late
[1:37:10] it's never too late you can always get
[1:37:11] on the right path amen but we don't want
[1:37:13] to get to the end and figure out we
[1:37:15] didn't and then we want to look at it
[1:37:16] today and say lord am i on the right
[1:37:18] path and what i'm doing is it pleasing
[1:37:20] you because if it's not i need to get in
[1:37:22] that path because that's the rapture
[1:37:23] revelation is that i know that that my
[1:37:26] life is pleasing to you
[1:37:28] amen that i'm doing what you've called
[1:37:30] me to do and the rapture will just be
[1:37:32] that last thing that he asked us to do
[1:37:34] he just says all right time to go
[1:37:37] and we'll say let's go and we'll just
[1:37:38] step right into it step into another
[1:37:40] dimension just like that amen i believe
[1:37:42] it'll be so simple
[1:37:44] i believe it'll be so simple when it
[1:37:46] happens i don't think we're going to
[1:37:47] have some some great preacher up in
[1:37:49] front of us or some this and that the
[1:37:50] other i believe we're just going to say
[1:37:52] lord we're coming home like like that
[1:37:53] quote brother gerald says it like it's
[1:37:55] time and we'll all know it
[1:37:56] we'll all know what it won't be like
[1:37:58] calling up hey do you want to go on the
[1:37:59] rapture today no no it'll just be that
[1:38:01] holy spirit i believe there'll be such a
[1:38:02] unity there'll be such a presence
[1:38:04] there'll be such a reality of god in our
[1:38:06] lives it'll just be it's going home time
[1:38:08] and we'll know all about it and it'll
[1:38:09] just be boom
[1:38:11] but guess what
[1:38:13] before the rapture happens we've got a
[1:38:14] lot of things that have to happen in the
[1:38:16] same way where we recognize now is the
[1:38:18] time
[1:38:19] now is the place
[1:38:21] i'm the person
[1:38:22] amen for
[1:38:24] for the the things that torment us for
[1:38:26] family situations that have tormented us
[1:38:28] that have dogged our habits amen for
[1:38:30] physical conditions that we have amen
[1:38:33] for complexes that have that we've faced
[1:38:35] throughout our entire life through
[1:38:36] addictions that we have and mentor
[1:38:38] weaknesses that just seem to come back
[1:38:40] over and over like paul that buffett him
[1:38:42] and buffett him and then brother branham
[1:38:44] was buffeted his entire life with
[1:38:45] stomach troubles but before he went that
[1:38:47] stomach trouble was taken care of do you
[1:38:49] remember that amen there is nothing that
[1:38:51] you're going to be tormented with in the
[1:38:53] end when you're ready to go it will all
[1:38:55] have to fall at your feet amen
[1:38:58] listen to this as we start to close last
[1:39:00] page
[1:39:01] oh just remember jesus humbled himself
[1:39:04] to death for you
[1:39:05] remember we talked about lowliness and
[1:39:07] meekness jesus humbled himself to death
[1:39:09] for you are you ready to humble yourself
[1:39:11] to death
[1:39:13] to the death of
[1:39:14] your status to the death of
[1:39:17] you know what everyone thinks about you
[1:39:20] for the sake of another brother or
[1:39:21] sister
[1:39:22] he says he was not fussy
[1:39:24] when they spit in his face he didn't
[1:39:26] spit back when they pulled his beard out
[1:39:28] he didn't pull at theirs
[1:39:31] when they slapped him on one side of the
[1:39:33] face
[1:39:34] and the other he never slapped them he
[1:39:35] prayed for them walked on humbly he was
[1:39:38] an example of humility
[1:39:40] he was full of faith
[1:39:42] that humility was what an expression of
[1:39:45] his faith that this was god's plan for
[1:39:46] him
[1:39:47] why he knowed his words couldn't fail he
[1:39:51] so lived by the word till he became the
[1:39:53] word amen
[1:39:56] oh god he says let me hold my both hands
[1:39:58] to god before this audience let me live
[1:40:01] like that let this word so become that
[1:40:03] me in this word is the same thing let my
[1:40:06] words be this word let the meditation of
[1:40:08] my heart let him be in my heart on my
[1:40:10] mind tie his commandments upon the post
[1:40:13] of my intelligence tie them upon the
[1:40:15] pulse of my heart let me just see him
[1:40:17] when temptation rises let me see christ
[1:40:20] when things go wrong let me just see him
[1:40:22] when i get ready and the enemy tries to
[1:40:24] get me angry let me see jesus what would
[1:40:27] he do
[1:40:28] he was so much in the word till him and
[1:40:30] the word became the self same thing he
[1:40:33] knowed he had power he knowed that he
[1:40:35] could do it he knew it was in him but he
[1:40:37] didn't want to use it till god told him
[1:40:39] to
[1:40:40] amen see he wanted to be god in him to
[1:40:44] be the word and all and he know that
[1:40:46] when he spoke anything that it was god's
[1:40:48] word and though heavens and earth pass
[1:40:50] away the word would someday conquer amen
[1:40:53] we are creatures bound in time right now
[1:40:55] and so the word doesn't always happen
[1:40:57] right when we speak it does it amen but
[1:40:59] it says he knew that the word would
[1:41:01] someday conquer amen that word goes out
[1:41:04] and it cannot return void the scripture
[1:41:06] says but it will accomplish that which i
[1:41:08] sent it for amen
[1:41:10] he says he wasn't fussy and stewie if
[1:41:12] we're fussy and stewie let me tell you
[1:41:14] we've got an issue there because he's
[1:41:15] saying when you know who you are and you
[1:41:17] know you're supposed to be where you are
[1:41:19] you won't be fussy and stewie because
[1:41:21] you have supreme confidence you have
[1:41:23] faith that god has put you in that
[1:41:24] situation
[1:41:25] he wasn't fussy and stewie he spoke just
[1:41:28] the words of god every word that come
[1:41:30] from his lips was god's anointed word
[1:41:33] god's anointed word that means it was
[1:41:35] god's word for that time place and
[1:41:37] season
[1:41:38] amen that's what anointed means that
[1:41:39] you're not just randomly speaking but it
[1:41:41] means that there it goes out with intent
[1:41:43] and purpose and it is god's intent and
[1:41:45] purpose that causes you to speak
[1:41:47] he says wouldn't it be wonderful if we
[1:41:49] could say that my words and god's words
[1:41:51] is the same
[1:41:52] what i say he honors it because i do
[1:41:55] nothing till he tells me first oh there
[1:41:58] is your example there is a life worthy
[1:42:01] of the gospel amen amen if you get
[1:42:03] anything get that
[1:42:05] what i say he honors it because i do
[1:42:08] nothing until he tells me first
[1:42:10] there's your example there is a life
[1:42:12] worthy of the gospel what a place to
[1:42:13] find yourself where you can say my word
[1:42:16] and god's word is the same praise the
[1:42:18] lord and then brother brother mark
[1:42:20] prayed about what being surrendered
[1:42:21] giving him the preeminence that's where
[1:42:23] we're going to find this amen is when we
[1:42:25] say lord i don't even want to have input
[1:42:29] i don't even want to have input
[1:42:31] i mean do you look at job and job had so
[1:42:33] many thoughts job had so many inputs on
[1:42:35] his situation job a wonderful man so
[1:42:38] good that god said to satan have you
[1:42:40] checked out my man job right there's no
[1:42:42] one like him on the earth
[1:42:44] and job had lots of input on who he was
[1:42:46] and how good he was and how great he was
[1:42:48] listen by the time god finished with job
[1:42:50] job says i will be silent
[1:42:53] if we can start with i will be silent
[1:42:55] rather than finish with i will be silent
[1:42:57] i feel like we could get through things
[1:42:58] a lot more simply amen a lot more easier
[1:43:01] if we said lord i have no input
[1:43:04] you are sovereign
[1:43:05] you know the end from the beginning you
[1:43:07] know my strengths you know my weaknesses
[1:43:09] so what lord i'm going to be silent and
[1:43:12] let you lead me and guide me in this and
[1:43:14] i'm not going to put any i'm not going
[1:43:15] to stick my oar in the water amen just
[1:43:17] let the rudder be moved by christ in the
[1:43:19] backs in the back of the boat amen
[1:43:21] listen to this this is a closing quote
[1:43:23] now
[1:43:25] he says we've got to follow
[1:43:27] every day
[1:43:28] every hour of the day every step of the
[1:43:32] way we've got to be led by the lord
[1:43:34] jesus christ
[1:43:35] he says if we don't we take an
[1:43:38] organizational life
[1:43:41] and a life that doesn't follow christ
[1:43:44] daily is not worthy
[1:43:46] why because you're going to get off on a
[1:43:48] place of your own making amen you're
[1:43:50] going to get your thoughts in there
[1:43:51] you're going to get your ideas in there
[1:43:52] or worse you're going to let somebody
[1:43:54] else tell you what god is saying and all
[1:43:56] of a sudden what you're in their place
[1:43:57] instead of god's place and then you're
[1:43:59] in god their will instead of god's
[1:44:01] willing man amen what he's saying is
[1:44:02] there are you a selective follower of
[1:44:04] christ one day are you seeking him and
[1:44:07] then the next you're not
[1:44:09] right one hour one moment one situation
[1:44:11] you do but then the next one you don't
[1:44:13] that's not what he's saying he's saying
[1:44:15] when you do that when it's on and off on
[1:44:17] and off he says what you're getting into
[1:44:18] as an organizational life because what
[1:44:20] you're saying is i need them here but i
[1:44:22] don't need them here i want them here
[1:44:23] but i don't want there and what is that
[1:44:25] that's denominational denomination is
[1:44:27] when you decide where god starts and
[1:44:28] finishes
[1:44:30] right and what he's saying is an
[1:44:31] organizational life is when you have god
[1:44:32] in every single aspect of our lives
[1:44:35] brother brown says if we don't seek him
[1:44:37] in every hour
[1:44:39] every hour of every day every day every
[1:44:41] step of the way he says we will take on
[1:44:44] an organizational life
[1:44:46] amen the musicians would come
[1:44:50] amen what is it we draw a line with our
[1:44:52] experience around god and then we draw a
[1:44:54] line and we say this is what defines
[1:44:57] good this is what defines acceptable
[1:44:59] this is what defines worthy brother
[1:45:01] branham say no no no you need to check
[1:45:02] up every day
[1:45:04] lord am i in your will lord am i doing
[1:45:06] what you've asked me to do lord am i
[1:45:08] doing it the way you asked me to do it
[1:45:10] right not just doing what he asked you
[1:45:11] to do but am i doing it the way you
[1:45:12] showed me to do it is it in line with
[1:45:14] your word it meant so often what we're
[1:45:16] doing is we're seeking but we don't read
[1:45:17] the word i love brother mark when he
[1:45:19] talked about retirement and he says i'm
[1:45:20] seeking will the will of god he says and
[1:45:22] then i read the word and boom it comes
[1:45:23] right out he says and what is it the
[1:45:25] holy spirit quickens it to me and i know
[1:45:26] exactly when to retire and how to retire
[1:45:28] and i don't worry about it anymore
[1:45:29] why because he didn't just say the lord
[1:45:31] wants me to retire today he said lord
[1:45:33] what do you want me to do about
[1:45:34] retirement then he's reading the word
[1:45:36] right and so the word is quickened to
[1:45:38] him under the anointing of the holy
[1:45:39] spirit he knows okay this is the time to
[1:45:41] do it and then he does it when the lord
[1:45:43] opens it up to him amen i couldn't move
[1:45:45] here in 2016.
[1:45:47] you've got to move as you're moved and
[1:45:49] then you've got to move as you're led by
[1:45:50] the holy spirit there are things that
[1:45:51] are supposed to happen at certain times
[1:45:53] and we've got to be seeking for that i i
[1:45:55] watched a bit of ron brown spencer's
[1:45:57] sermon or sermon the other day and guess
[1:45:59] what he did a two-hour prayer line
[1:46:02] but he said i don't just do prayer lines
[1:46:04] he has a very special gift and then he's
[1:46:06] got a gift of faith and he's got a gift
[1:46:08] to foresight he's got a prophetic gift
[1:46:09] inside of him but he says i don't just
[1:46:11] do
[1:46:13] those types of things why because he's
[1:46:15] seeking the leadership of god he's
[1:46:17] seeking the moving of the holy spirit
[1:46:18] and the people he's seeking for faith to
[1:46:20] rise to the point where god can do
[1:46:22] something in the people amen if all we
[1:46:24] do is just roll prayer lines every
[1:46:26] single day then what would happen they'd
[1:46:27] have no effect
[1:46:28] right you've got to wait for god to
[1:46:30] quicken the people for god to move in
[1:46:31] the people and then when he does that he
[1:46:33] says we've got great needs but we've got
[1:46:34] faith here to take care of it and they
[1:46:35] call people up and they pray for them
[1:46:37] and then you expect the miracles to
[1:46:38] follow why because god was leading it
[1:46:40] and it wasn't an abuse of a gift or i've
[1:46:42] seen this or i've seen that but rather
[1:46:44] he's waiting on the holy spirit to
[1:46:45] quicken them amen
[1:46:47] we've done it here amen how many times
[1:46:49] have i called a prayer meeting i'm not
[1:46:50] like brother ron but i've only ever
[1:46:52] invited people to come twice
[1:46:54] and how many sermons have i preached
[1:46:55] here now 30 40 50 something like that
[1:46:58] maybe at this point why because that's
[1:47:00] got to be the leading of the holy spirit
[1:47:02] it's the same thing for so many things
[1:47:03] in our life is we're just looking for
[1:47:05] him to lead and move and we get that
[1:47:07] unction and then when we do we move but
[1:47:08] otherwise we sit there and we may know
[1:47:10] what's coming but we got to say lord
[1:47:11] when do you want me to step out then
[1:47:13] when he does you do and then that's when
[1:47:15] you say i've got faith now because this
[1:47:17] wasn't me because if it was me i would
[1:47:18] have done it a long time ago amen amen
[1:47:20] but now lord you've given me the unction
[1:47:22] you've given me that movement you've
[1:47:24] given me that push in that direction and
[1:47:26] now i'm moving into that i'm speaking it
[1:47:28] i'm believing it i'm confessing it i'm
[1:47:30] moving in that direction we're trusting
[1:47:31] you to make the way when we get there
[1:47:33] amen i mean god bless you just let's
[1:47:35] just stand together if we would
[1:47:37] amen brother brad i'm saying there to
[1:47:38] live a worthy life we have to be led by
[1:47:40] him every single day amen we have to be
[1:47:42] seeking him every single day we have to
[1:47:44] be looking for his leadership in every
[1:47:46] portion of our lives every single day
[1:47:48] amen god help us
[1:47:51] god help us amen
[1:47:52] that we would in everything big or small
[1:47:54] that we would seek his will that we
[1:47:56] would seek his face that we would seek
[1:47:57] his favor so that we can have confidence
[1:47:59] as we move forward
[1:48:00] amen let's just bow our heads
[1:48:05] or jesus perhaps a somber way to finish
[1:48:08] lord a challenge to our faith a
[1:48:09] challenge to our walk
[1:48:11] what a challenge to our confession
[1:48:14] but lord as we've read your word
[1:48:17] lord we take correction where we need it
[1:48:20] lord we ask your grace we ask your
[1:48:21] forgiveness where we pushed our way to
[1:48:23] the front
[1:48:24] lord where we've injected our own part
[1:48:26] yes amen nor were we presumed
[1:48:29] on who and what we are but lord we also
[1:48:33] believe
[1:48:34] that we have acted
[1:48:35] lord that we have spoken in faith
[1:48:37] lord at the moving of your holy spirit
[1:48:39] in our lives and lord whether it's
[1:48:41] situations for health
[1:48:43] or whether it's finances whether it's
[1:48:45] for lost ones

[1:48:49] situations lord whether it's for
[1:48:50] complexes we have lord we are trusting
[1:48:53] and believing that your word has healed
[1:48:54] us lord that you sent it for that
[1:48:56] purpose lord and it's gone forth and
[1:48:58] it's not going to return to us void
[1:49:00] so lord i pray you help us day by day to
[1:49:02] just follow your leadership lord that we
[1:49:04] would surrender ourselves to you that
[1:49:06] you would have the preeminence lord

[1:49:09] preeminence is given lord the only thing
[1:49:11] that's left is a rapture amen lord grant
[1:49:13] us grace to surrender ourselves lord
