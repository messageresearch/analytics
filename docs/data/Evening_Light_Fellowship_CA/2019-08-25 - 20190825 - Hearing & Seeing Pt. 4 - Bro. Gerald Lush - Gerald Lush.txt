our Savior by the grace of God so we prayed grace of his presence with us today we need him help but help god i prayed lord help us to believe the word he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you he saw be with you even in you to the end of the age and what's he doing in us he's revealing himself he's revealing his word he's revealing his plan and purpose for for our lives but what but for for his purpose in the earth amen he's got a plan he's got a purpose he's got a pattern so I pray the grace of God that were into the revelation of that plan we're part of that plan amen we're part of the purpose of God and the pattern of God amen so brother I pray grace that will worship Him morning noon and night a man so the Lord blessed us and thank you again for your prayers while we were absent and sorry that we were not here to say farewell to the bigots and also our sister Berta Z a man we thank the Lord for our sisters testimony they made a testimony that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever just think they'd admit that the ministry that they experienced in the Alpha ministry that she experienced in the Omega ministry while Jesus who did - did to those in his day when he was here in flesh Jesus did the same thing in the end time - sisters to the vertices a man so we thank God for that it's amazing that the Lord sent somebody our way that actually experienced a man what God had done in these last days and I trust my graces is making us more aware brother certain more conscious of what God is doing a man so brothers sister that's our salvation that's our redemption that's the Blessed hope is to recognize what God is doing they mad too often we're looking back to what God has done and maybe what God will do but what is God doing what is God doing in your life what is God doing in this assembly a man brother we want we want to recognize that and we want to be a part of it we might be right there a man with the grace of God in the Word of God so well god help us to to believe it God help us to recognize it God help us to keep moving on amen and trusting the revealed word amen and again I say it again I've had to repeat it while I was gone that there is no book like this one and brother it from beginning to end it's got a plan it's got a purpose and it's got a pattern a man so brother but that's what the world doesn't doesn't recognize is the planned purpose and pattern then your think there's a god and only wrote the book and he had this one do this this one do that yeah but he had a purpose a man went in the beginning he created the heaven and the earth he had a purpose a man he had a plan yeah and he had a pattern and I trust that we're part of his plan is purposed in his pattern I trust that God will give you a greater revelation of your part in God's plan a man there's nothing accidental a man not for the elect of God not forgot he is ordained this he has ordained that he has predestinated this predestinated that so I trust by the grace of God that God is recognizing our attitude is radar spirit is right we're on meaning we're thirsting a man to get more and more of God in our lives praise the Lord and we're all in a thirsting for what our brother was singing the course about concerning the rapture Amen brother he's got to get us out of here amen all the elect of God all the predestinated seat of God all those with a right right attitude and the right spirit we got to get out of here because he's going to make a new heaven and a new earth amen and then we'll come back and to reign with him in his strong they praise the Lord to God be the glory so god bless her brother Vegas there's no doubt they're back in Tucson or and our sister put Isaac Matassa a man is history eighty-two years old but still loving the Lord 82 years old still trusting the Lord still remembering what God did in her life in this hour so it was a blessing to us a man God kept her on the scene all this time before to be here to give the witness to you and me a man so God be praised and I bring greetings because we endeavored by the grace of God to minister to the Saints outside the city and to serve communion and foot washing and the Saints send their greetings from the Ellsworth's in caramel and they said make sure you give our greetings to the Saints he said and all of them might tell them that we're praying for them amen thank the Lord and of course the the brother Thales were sorry in their 80s and then most that I administered to are getting real really really old physically but getting younger spiritually by the grace of God so the Elsword send their greens our brother Karen straight and Linda Peck fruit in Phillips and they also send their greetings and of course our brother Tom and sister Shirley and Bishop Falls and we're able to minister to them and again they're in their eighties so we thank the Lord for the opportunity to serve them the communion a man and also again we had a wonderful time with our sister drover a man she's bedridden but I'll tell you this she's not been ridden fish virtually no not by any means it was it was a real blessing a man to have fellowship with her and to serve with the communion so god bless our sister drove her and she says the greetings to everybody here and she's usually list tune in online a man so and like I said she's in her bed this morning and maybe watching the service so god bless our sister drover and she's really into the word she's really looking for the resurrection the rapture if the doctor tells her this she'll tell the doctor that amen oh yes she's not ashamed of it she tells the doctor I'm not afraid she said to die she said that's good she said I'll be with my husband I'll be glory with the Lord a man she says she's tells the doctor those things where they wanted to do this they wanted to do that because they want to preserve her light but she's not into that a man she said to the Word of God she's into the promise of God and she's looking for she's looking for a body like his glorified body a man so I pray God bless our sister drove her I pray God give us the joy the peace the love that she has for the Lord amen and the shares were the promises of God a man so it's it was a real blessing to be with her and also of course with our brother Tom and sister Shirley was also a blessing to be with them and the others so keep them in prayer and of course our brother Ron and sister Shirley and they're right there to serve the body they're right there to help all the saints of God so in a state send their

a man praise the Lord God bless you turn with me to the book of Revelation chapter one walk my visitor today god bless your brother amen amen praying God's to grace be with the Saints that are not with us today that are on holidays are visiting somewhere amen the grace of God that will not forget God grace of God they would not leave Jesus out of anything we do a man in all things we want him to be with us praise the name of the Lord in the book of Revelation and reading from verse nine to eleven I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation we're going to take our stand for the word we're going to experience tribulation in everyday life not the Great Tribulation but the tribulation of living for Jesus the tribulation of taking our stand for the truth of the word of God so he said I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ and he said was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ a man what it was what are we enduring for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day a man or the day of the Lord in the end of all things a man I trust that we were also identified with John and that we are in the Spirit of God a man on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet heard behind me a great voice he heard it and he was going to see it a man is one thing to hear it well what about seeing what God wants you to see and not only that again as we get back into this message are we going to are we going to see it the way that God has ordained it and predestinated for us to see really what God has done what God is doing what God will do a man's not it's not all on what he's done and what he will do but it's in we're brought up we want to focus on what God is doing a man then how would he do with that revival of that revival of this church and that church what's he doing now a man and reversing the problem all down through the ages a man has seen God yesterday and tomorrow but they don't recognize him today a man but to get to have the faith that pleases God and without faith that is impossible to please him a man and what is for faith that pleases God is a faith the revelation of what he's doing in the present tense a man not just past tense but the present tense a man and believing also what he will do in the future so I pray God that we're in the present tense revelation of God and he said John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice and it was the voice of theophanies a man they ordained and predestined her to to reveal to John a man what God has done what God was going to do a man gen John was part was to be part of that revelation so he said and it was like a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last a man and what thou seest write in a book where it we see it and we one the Holy Ghost to write it in our hearts a man so that now the word the word was made flesh in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us well in these last days he promised it again in the in the Omega ministry the word is made flesh in mrs. Jesus Christ in his right little by little by little he has revealed himself to finally in the end and he where he promised to restore all things the word is made flesh in the right and brother now we are recognizing the Alpha and the Omega God the first and the last coming from eternity into time but now we're going from time back to eternity praise the Lord and he said and what they'll see us write in a book what we see make sure it's written in our hearts a man and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia a man we want to bear witness of it to the world a man because we are looking at and we are we see we see the witness as the word of the seven Church ages a man and so there but again there just there's a sinner in a past tense but not in the present tense they just worry because they organized it and they became a denomination but God moved on and God moved on and God moved on and I trust a god a God has moved on and God is in US and I trust we're not going to organize we're not gonna make any nomination we're gonna move on with God in the resurrection and the rapture in the glorified bodies amen recognizing the Alpha and Omega 2,000 years ago recognizing the Alpha and Omega today praise the name of the Lord and he said what they'll see is write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia under emphasis under sir Myrna under pergamus on the tyre Tara and under Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto Laodicea and I turned to see the voice to hear it or see it he turned to see the voice are we seeing the voice I'm recognizing the Word made flesh a man while we're hearing is and seen is the same thing it is the Word made flesh for this day and this hour it is God revealing to us what we need to know and what we need to see and what we need to stand for in this day and in this hour not not just saying God did this God did this God did this but let's believe that God is doing this a man so that was that happen in the Alpha ministry then they knew what God did but they never had the revelation what God was doing our Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's why they crucified him and they don't recognize what God is doing in this hour in mrs. Jesus Christ and that's why they'll crucify the it's the second crucifixion of the word of God the Word was made flesh land they crucified it the word is made flesh today and they'll crucify it amen amen we're going to lose our rights particular because we're taking our stand for this we're taking our stand for that a man the world the world wants to compromise with it but we're gonna take our stand by the Lord a man what does the Bible say as I was visiting with an individual and and he was talking about the Bible's that he had there and I won't say where they were proud and he said old my brother he said it's amazing what they're doing with the Word of God and he's saying they're printing these Bibles this version this version this version and so on to finally there's a version in the Bible where they have left out an entire chapter a man now I said brother of the world can they do that when Brooklyn in Revelation says don't head to it and don't take away from it the Word of God but brother whoever printed that certain that certain version of the Bible left out an entire chapter because they didn't believe exactly whether what the brother was saying in that chapter and not only that he said he said they there if it went on through and if the Bible condemned this they leave out that verse and the Bible could name that they live over that verse amen if there's anything there then you know that the governments and then the world and the churches are going along with and but the Bible condemns it they're going to do when they omit that from the Bible old brother again we are in the end we're in the last days and so as there were radiant in radiant obeying the book of Revelation and we have it and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book amen you can't add to the Word of God and you cannot take away from it amen and if you're a seed of God you want the truth the whole truth and you want nothing but the a man by the grace of Almighty God so the grace of God be with us amen there we're gonna we're going to leave the word the way it is we're going to believe what God is doing in our day according to the word and he said I turned to see the voice you hear it but then you got to see what it's saying you got to see what it means and you're going to see it the way God wants you to see it now the way the church wants you to see it the way God wants you to see it amen and he said and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks he said one like unto the Son of man a man he was clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle amen the revelation of Jesus Christ in this day in this hour a man as yes as our Lord and Savior of the bright but as a judge of the world now he stressed as a judge in this hour and this message is the message is calling the elect out for the resurrection rapture but as bringing judgment upon the world bringing judgment upon the earth a man so grace that were going to catch the grace of the revealed word a man not the gentleman but the grace of the revealed word that's going to give us resurrection and Rob free faith to get us out of here and he said his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass his judgment as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters a man the revelation of the word down through the ages his voice is the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the Sun Shine a--the in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead a man grace they were going to die to ourselves any a lady's right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death god bless his word you may be seated it was God Kent bringing John into the ring to the dimension to reveal to him the mystery of God the plan of God the purpose and the pattern down and especially dead down for the church ages and amen believing that this was the light of God in the first age but in the last days we know that the light a man it goes into total darkness a man concerning the last stage a man but the Prophet God did say said I put that little bit there because we're because the bride is going to get out of the load of C&H and we're going into the bride age and in the bride age is the revelation of the word Amen it is the finish of the mystery of God and as age as he told John again in Revelation 10 and he said now he said don't do this and don't do that or he said seal this and seal that because he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he said the mystery of God is going to be finished go who is the seventh angel as the cogman has he gone we believe that the seventh angel has come and the seventh angel is gone a man but he has left for the bride the revelation of the revealed word the revelation of the mystery of God and he said right there in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he is declared to his servants the prophets a man but who's going to recognize the the the prophet who's going to literally recognize the ministry that's going to finish the mystery of God that's going to reveal the mystery of God there's not going to be very many in this day and in this hour in this age that are going to recognize it amen because we find that in the last search age where we went into a total darkness a man Oh God did God did this God did that God did this but eventually the enemy got in a man and caused him to organize that cause Allah make a denomination out of it hey man man and and and when they made a denomination of it we believe this we believe this we believe that period Amen but you don't you don't say that I believe this period I believe that period no and whatever else the Lord will reveal amen not just what he did but what he's hundred what he's doing and what he's going to do but what happened what happened after the church ages they believed what God did as a word but then there was a generation rose up that wouldn't believe anything else they believe this is it now we were going to believe this this is our Creed a man but God had got moved on to another race another age another age and brother so did the devil as he was in the Garden of Eden a man so the Soviets in this day our he's and he's in the garden of the spiritual Eden he was in the garden of the physical he 90 I need to see the woman and the woman deceived the man a man and so now he's in this hour and in this age brother right on down through again we're dealing with with the devil in the Garden of Eden the spiritual Garden of Eden and brother as he deceived them back man mm solid 6,000 years ago he's deceiving them now amen to believe all you got to do is go to church all they got to do is do this all you got to do is believe that you got to believe what God is doing amen now what he's done but what he's doing and then in what you and I are witnessing is that they do not believe what God has done and what God is doing they do not believe what God is going to do amen where is our faith is adjusting what God did or isn't in what God is doing and what God will do amen to be part of the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of God we got to recognize what he's doing to give us resurrection and rapturing pain ain't man and then we then we believe and understand what he's going to do a man we're going to be resurrected we're going to be raptured we're going from time to eternity man we're going to go into a glorified body like his glorious Marty hey man we're going to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen we're going to sit with him in his role by the grace of Almighty God God Elvis to believe it god help us to recognize it amen not just say I believe God did this I believe God did they that's good but let's say I believe God is doing this and that is why that we are here this morning amen if we're going to go by what God did with the other in the denomination maybe in Pentecost or or or the United Pentecostal church but because we're believing what God is doing amen it separates us strong organized religion amen and it separates us unto the Lord amen that's what he did in his helpful ministry he had to call them out and he man because the word brought him out from from from the religion of that day the scribes and the Pharisees and the Jewish religion a man but they were so organized they did not believe what God was doing just think it was the word in flesh and they crucified it Amen here there they were they would appreciate in their synagogues they were looking for the Messiah because you know God said here God said there Genesis right on down through the prophets God said he was going to send the Messiah I was going to do this but brother when God came on the scene in flesh and begin to do it they didn't believe it they didn't recognize it a man because he wasn't there to promote them he was there to promote God it wasn't there to promote but they their ideas he was there to promote the Word of God amen and get the attention of men are not to man but to get the attention put on God get the attention but on the Lord a man and that's what God is doing even even still here today brother sure they're going for the word he wants to get your attention on him he wants you to pay attention to his word he wants you to to catch his word he wants you to recognize his word ain't my brother no a God would come and say oh yeah I did that but do you know what I'm doing Oh Lord will you promise this you promise that but do you recognize the promise being fulfilled amen the revelation of me fulfilling this promise in that promise Amen because we know again let me read it again concerning the church Aegis amen and too often people think oh whether that's in the book of Revelation and we're not going to understand this when I couldn't understand that well brother John understood it John heard the voice and then he saw John earthís and he saw this John her that he saw that a man but here would totally blend with what he was seeing by the grace of God amen and brother then ain't ready ready in the end of it all all praise the name of the Lord the bridegroom was now made flesh in the bride a man he said I am Alpha and Omega brady way there in the last chapter of Revelation and it says and the spirit and the bride say come 2000 years ago it was the bridegroom saying come unto me amen now it's the spirit of the bridegroom saying come amen and drink of the waters of life praise the name of the Lord God's grace brother but but you and I are experiencing what you and I are are dealing with them and then fighting spiritually is the condition of the church world today brother because in the loudest C&H they went into total darkness in the letter C and H on my brother in the light of CH the religious world is guilty of spiritual Alzheimer's amen the world is focusing on natural Alzheimer's but brother I tell you they're spiritually the churches is guilty of spiritual Alzheimer's because the person with Alzheimer's don't know who they are don't know who they're who their friends are who their family is even better this brother if you've got the Holy Ghost you know who your father is a man and said the old what manner of love the father bestowed upon us where baby cry have a father father father a man and then we are brothers and sisters of like precious faith because we are the sons and daughters of God we're being Oh God were born again amen sons and daughters of God but brother the church when all they're doing to organized religion so much whether they never recognized God when he came on the scene a man and he said he said I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot and I would that were cold or hot and Brett oh my lord have mercy on us brother don't ask fear come on us a man God wants you a God wants and not a lukewarm God wants you to be cold or hot one or the other Amen but if you're lukewarm I show that you're insane show that you lost your mind Amen if you're lukewarm you're experiencing spiritual enemy Alzheimer's a man you are and that's what's going on out there in the world today while the world is facing naturally the world is also experiencing spiritually it is spiritual Alzheimer's a man because he said I would that they were cold or hot and because they are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you or spit you out of my mouth so that the church is no longer God's mouthpiece the bride is God's mouthpiece any man I trust that you are God's mouthpiece Oh what God is doing and what God will do hey man you're gonna be a witness of the revelation of the prophecy for these last days amen everything is and everything is coming to its conclusion amen the world is absolutely and completely insane because I've received the emails just recently emails from pastors in certain countries and they're saying old my brother I got to deal with this I got to deal with it can you please explain why what we should do and how we should do it amen according to the word according to the measure of the hour what is the teaching what is the understanding that I need a man and brothers getting more and more and more complicated a night because why because the devil is the god of this world if not Jesus is not a hello he the devil amai because they're listening to the devil more than to listen to Jesus amen and the following saying that his ideas were there following God's ideas and the revelation of Jesus Christ amen remember he was Satan in the Garden of Eden amen a God had given them his word now he said they should you eat this and either Sanitas but it's of the tree of knowledge of good and evil don't eat of it hey May and he said lest you die hey man and the devil come and like I said he was the first evangelist and any priest Eve and brother with the gospel that he preached to he persuaded her amen and with the gospel the devil is preaching to the world today amen he has persuaded them to believe this to believe that and he has persuaded them all don't believe this or that God has done in Malachi 4 don't believe all this here revelation 10 amen concerning the revelation of the mystery of the seven seals and give me give me the bride resurrection drive through faith no no no he don't want us to believe that a man as he is he went and he came on the seat in that scene in the first age oh yeah God said this when the devil said that a man the deeds of the Nicolaitans a man and they were believing what the devil was saying the devil's interpretation of what God was doing and they were believing Satan more and more and more and more and more as they got more and more organized in their religion more and more organized in the revelation of the head a man making a denomination out of it and all you know God said don't add to it don't take from it but whether that has God reveals it ain't man but brother I turn to this to make make it a denomination of it and enternity turning like the revelation into a Creed ain't man and the treatise I believe we believe this this this and this well we believe the Bible we believe the word we believe the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth hey Maya but the enemy got among them hey man and to interpret what God was doing as he did interpret it to Eve a man so he interpreted to the Spurs relieve down to the churches Church ages and the first what we have so many churches as well we had so much in the realm of organized religion a man but thank God that he brought us out of the spirit of organized religion a man so we were in or in the in the realm of the Holy Ghost with the liberty to believe it is written to believe thus saith the Lord a man brother that and all I pray in the name of Jesus brother when the enemy comes to tempt us as he tempted Jesus brother we're going to give him the same answer that Jesus gave him and every time the devil tempted Jesus he said it is written amen it is written it is written but that was an example for you and me in this hour when the enemy comes in with religion and pretending it is a spiritual all your devices as the Bible says that yes but it is written it is written you need that you need to use that brother when it comes to witnessing and testifying to the people out there even though many are religious there's time death they'll say this they'll say that we believe this we believe there yes that's fine but it is also written they won't believe that but not what else got us given Amen sir brother a telephone it came down to the to the enemy true his false religion down for the church ages amen he brought on he brought on the people that that spirit of of Alzheimer's a man too funny they did they forgot who they weren't they don't really recognize who they are and they don't recognize one another as the sons and daughters of God and you know the when it comes to our brothers and sisters of like precious faith no no and so they're just brothers and sisters in in a church faith a man the faith that could delegate them oh yeah the devil gave Eve faith but brother I turn it is it was going to destroy them not save them amen but God permitted it for a reason right to bring out what's here going on here today hey man guys see he had a purpose he had a plan he had a pattern so brother he allowed this he knew what was going to happen this was an accidental as I as I said four years as a Christian before I came to the river of Malachi 4 and what God was doing today in this our brother Isis had the idea of the bud the Bible and so that's God's book you know and all your God did this with the devil when did this we believe that in a sense that the devil trick God we believe that in a sense of the devil you know you eat to see God you can't deceive God anybody you can trigger it because God no one knows what no one knows what's going on God knew what was going to happen ain't no but God permitted it for a reason hey man so do you have the revelation of white God permitted I preached a number of times why did God permit it why did God allow this and this and this all down through the ages hey man what for it is to bring out his seed he managed to make manifest the seed of God who was going to stay with his word any man and only that who was going to love him for who he is a man that God's going to reel his character and you're gonna love him because he's such a God any man because God is love he's not willing that any should perish but he knows many are going to perish a man and the majority are gonna perish yeah but he's there to call out his elect praise the name he's there to catch his seat oh yeah brother sister he deliver the Bible says in Malachi there that he even helps and the the wicked he said they that tempt God are even delivered a man that's Malachi 450 or 315 even they that tempt God are delivered amen oh yes that's God's grace and that's God's love but yet the thing of it is we know that because what's in their heart God sees what's in their heart and he knows that anything in their hearts they don't love him he knows that in in their hearts they don't know they don't love his children they don't love his word amen and in the end they're destroyed and they had their time in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone that's their time now it's not just a part time we know it's good it's the second death God help his brother oh I pray in the name of Jesus don't get spiritual loss anguish please don't do that just let's let the Holy Spirit but continue to bring to our remembrance what God is saying continue to bring to our remembrance what we need to know what we need to hear what we need to recognize any man to give us the faith that pleases God and brothers not the faith just in Luther's day in Wesley's day it's a greater and greater and greater faith because God is giving us that plus plus plus plus and to finally he give us the full revelation of who he is and his prayer the full revelation of his plan and his purpose and great and the myrrh and the vast majority of the world today religiously they do not recognize God's plan no no they just recognize this happened this happened God did this God did this God but they don't know recognize God's purpose they don't recognize that God knew it amen God allowed it daughter God God obey her from the foundation of the world was all in the mind of God I trust we're in the mind of God a man then he recognized us in Israel as the sons and daughters of God and they men and he hallelujah and after the fall he gave the promise of redemption knowing that those that respond to redemption would be is saved children a man his sons and daughters our brothers and sisters of like precious faith amen all brother hallelu not one with religion is one with one another because Christ is in you Christ in me and were one were one amen by the grace of God and he said you're nada you're now hard you're not call you're a lukewarm you really you got religion but did it and most people got religion but they don't have the spiritual revelation of God they're not spiritual they're religious but not spiritual the world is religious but they're not spiritual amen to be spiritual is to catch the revelation of God spiritual is to recognize God what he's done what he's doing what god help us brother we gotta hear it and we got to see it the way that God wants us to hear and the way that God wants us to see it brother when he came in the Alpha ministry and he and he declared this he did this he did this he preached this he preached that amen Oh the disciples recognize it they recognize this they saw this they saw that they heard it and they seen it as I've been preaching on here I have heard but now I see and what are you here with you don't hear with your ears you hear with the ear of the soul amen let him that hath an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the church amen and you see it not with their now with your natural eyes let em better than oh yeah here you see it with your natural eye not eyes amen your spiritual I'd rather not your spirit not natural Oh because if we see it with our natural eyes then the rest of the world's gonna see but God has revealed it and God has made it made it manifest in such a way so is that we're gonna hear it in our souls we're gonna see it in our souls by the grace of God amen what are you hearing in your soul and what are you seeing in your soul not in your religious mind but in your soul amen and he said because I sense I am rich increase with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not if they don't know it they got Alzheimer's spiritual I trust you don't have severe Alzheimer's grace of God to us amen well yet I know there's a lot of believers what I've witnessed over the last over 50 years I'll tell you this brother a lot of professing believers they came out just like the Egyptians came out with Moses but they had Alzheimer's oh yeah they wouldn't go in and possess the land God turned them back into a wilderness they wanted to go back to Egypt well they did in their heart oh yeah in the harsh they went back to Egypt they come under Satan's rule oh yeah when it comes to Satan slavery how many are under Satan's slavery oh I pray the grace of God brother we're under God's leadership now Satan slavery amen oh yeah so now they come out there's a lot of believers that have come out at all brother I told it to you straight is the gate and ours the way a few there be that find it I'll tell you this when it comes to the number of believers that have come out identified with this message and so on are terrorists there's going to be very few that's going in to rapture again the prophet of god did say 500 around the world living Saints if you want to be one of them you better die more and more to yourself amen come more more alone to the word more and more led to the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life amen sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God not the spirit of the preacher now there's writ of a even veteran but the Spirit of God is Christ in us it's like he said you can understand all mysteries you can understand understand all doctrine you can you can you can move my have faith to move mountains but he said they don't have divine law it's all vain the evidence of the Holy Ghost is divine law although I know it's believed in the word yeah but you're gonna have divine love to recognize the word and to believe the word not only I'm experiencing a scene divine love less and less and less as the as Jesus said lovest thou me to peter lovest thou me more than these God Alice brother they are wretched and the people are becoming more wretched miserable poor blind and naked spiritually they were boasting of their of all that they had naturally but God was looking to see what they had spiritually and as I said I've seen many believer fall back under this Lauda seeing spirit or cell professing to believe the message but they are spiritually dead they're religious but spiritually did be on your guard and be on your toes it is later than we think but he said I count so they and God is counseling you with his word to do this to do this to do this I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that made me rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may se as many as I love a man I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent but how many are really really zealous of repentance really lord have mercy understood in this hour forgive us Lord in this hour Lord all that devilís is on my heels oh yeah Satan's on our heels to try and to try and deceive us as he did Eve in the garden oh yeah don't think if that's over with don't think us Jesus came and died and and all it's all done now listen if your elective God you are till this this is wonderful this is wonderful thus it our sins are cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness just think gone the seed of God the elect of God that predestinated those that God knew and whose names are on the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world praise the name of the Lord you are perfect before God but you're gonna you're gonna recognize that you're gonna live it I like it you're gonna have that attitude that spirit of gratefulness to the Lord thank you Jesus amen but you're gonna be on your guard if you're the seed of God and your sins are in God's in God's the Sea of God's forgetfulness God's forget from us God if you if you repent truly repented of your heart and you've been born again and baptized with the Holy Ghost divine love of God God don't see any of your scene it is gone you are perfect but God is looking at your heart amen to God be the glory oh brother he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent where is the zealousness of the word in the people very few words Ellis like they used to be they were really Oh hungry thirsty the Holy Ghost zeal all move on move on well thank you lord thank you lord Alleluia we're going in the resurrection were going to the rapture now it's become to most believers it's just a just a doctrine yeah the rapture is a doctrine the resurrection that's the doctrine God's gonna do this God's gonna do that no he wants you to do it he wants you to do it he's giving us that he's giving us that word just giving us that faith what for director revelation of who we are where we come from why we're here where we're going how to get there amen let us just raise their hands say Lord we're coming home hey Mary we're on our way home Lord keep Laura keep us in touch with you keep in touch with your word Lord now let's keep walking in the land of the Lord Lord don't let us don't let us move away told us focus on the world brother when you see the world and things of the world you look turn your turn your hand amen if you love the world or the things of the world things it might be close yeah it might be the things of the world out there that they're offering you the love of God is not in you if you got the love of God the things of God got preeminence in your life the Word of God got Prem's in your life any man the family of God got preeminence in your life Amen you're living for one another why for for the rapture for the resurrection praise the Lord so he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous do you have that Oh legal seal as Jesus did that only goes real for God to fulfill his word in you bring his word to pass in you in the bride oh he brought the word to pass in the right groom and how he's working on the bride Jesus laid down his light picked it up again and resurrected and the Saints the Old Testament Saints many of the Old Testament Saints resurrected with him and went into the city appeared unto many and then forty days later when Jesus went up into the cloud they went off with him and brother is there in the book of Revelation says open up the doors you ever know what he gates here for lasting doors let the King of glory come in they said it was thinking of glory that was that was the first resurrection that was the rapture that was Jesus after he after he lay down his life picked it up again and he ascended up amen he's going to go in any man because he was the evidence that Redemption was finished a man they had redeemed them they said it's the Lord mighty in battle he said the king of kings praise the name of the Lord oh yeah and they opened up the door and let him come in and what did you do he went to the throne of God and and that body that body cut we called refer to as Jesus he went me just stood it before the throne and on the day of pentecost he came back down a man in the form of the holy ghost to be with us and in us a man hallelujah he said I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come to you and anybody I'll be with you in you and he said you I'll be I'll be in you you and me I in you I and the father father and me and I in you you and me we're one with God praise in our souls praise the name of the Lord Oh God Elvis brother amen amen let the King of glory come in he said behold I stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he would me just think that the churches that put Christ on the outside but he's calling for the bride he's calling for the elect and that's why we're here hey man that's why we're here because we responded to his call we want fellowship with him and he wants to tell us it with us a man and to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and him sit down with my father in his throne he that Anthon hear not ears let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches that in math and here in the soul say what God is saying what the Holy Ghost is saying to the church to the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ the brides gone here yeah I heard it but those in the church that I attended didn't hear a man and because I could because I bore witness of the word that the pastor called me in and threatened me yeah he said if you don't hold your peace he said I ain't gonna bring you up before the Lord the church board I said brother don't worry you won't have to do that I said I won't be back now so I came out of the office went over to get it get my coat and I still wonder who it was I don't know but a sister was standing in the door because the service was still going on and her sister came and stood at the door and when I went to pass her she said oh excuse me brother she said you were in the pastor's office I said yes sister oh I said I thought you were she said and it seemed like she was concerned or whatever but I said the Lord bless you and she said god bless you and I got my coat and went on I never went back that's right oh yeah there from there on I began to just be free of denominations free of organized religion and so on and finally I came in contact with a with a brother that lived in the in the city and Andy and his wife and if they were believing what we're believing here today by the grace of God and they're still going on and still alive and they're living in New Brunswick and so on but he even is pastor in another Church there called me and blame me for causing that man to leave his church but I didn't do that but I did talk to the pastor regarding the Word of God and understanding the Word of God and so on now of course after I said that God blessed you Sara said I'll leave and he went and told his friends he said all that that guy he says he haven't got a clue he says about that about Pentecost it was the Pentecostal church he said yeah I've got a clue moving us well maybe I had more clothes than needed yeah that's right because eventually I did witness that brother going off into a modern form of Pentecostalism no did God be the glory I say they didn't all turn against me because one of the one of the high leaders of the Pentecostal movement him in Newfoundland he's still alive but he always greets me as brother Gerald if I were to walk by him today he would greet me yeah thank God god help us brother that we're going to hear the word of God we're going to hear his voice and that you're here today to hear the voice to reveal the will of God to you a man and he said I stand at the door and knock he said he's at the door of your heart knocking they won't let him into the church a man but will you let him into your heart so you can have fellowship with him and he left fellowship with you you love him and he loves you by the grace of God a man and he said well that fellowships up with one another and with him and he with me and to him that overcometh and he said he that Anthony er did him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches again it's the year of your soul amen oh my turn with me to revelation 6 I tried my grace to bring it to a conclusion I won't bring this sermon to a conclusion concerning I have heard but now I see but to bring these thoughts to a conclusion and let me say this if we go into the word hearing is one thing but seeing is another many heard the Prophet but they didn't see didn't see him as a prophet oh they recognize William Branham as being an old man with a tremendous ministry he had he had these signs that nobody else ever had except Jesus 2,000 years ago and he could an our sister Berta Z it was good thank the Lord for her testimony because she made him a man now in Britain guys why because she was sick and I was blessed when she claimed that she experienced the first sign that the angel gave the Gabriel in Brenham but and it was his left hand a man and he had to take their left hand in his left hand why why because it was heart-to-heart a man he was going to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart he would discern again what was wrong with them and that's amazing that we that our sister gave the testimony that she saw what was going on in his left hand when he took hers a man but then when he prayed it was gone and he said you're healed so he had he had that sign and then of course she he went and he ministered to another one there she went and stood by the door and he went over to her after and discerned the thoughts and intents of her heart to God be the glory amen it was just to get the attention to the third pole the revealing of the word to give us what God wants us to have rapture in faith there's anything God wants us to have in this hour his rapture in thing there's this doctrine this doctrine this doctrine all of it but it's giving us fracturing faith so we have raised our hands Lord and coming home so by grace revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard have we heard we've got to hear it in our hearts and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see he's going to hear it the way God wanted him to hear he's going to see it the way God wanted to see it verse three and we had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see it's God revealing his world amen and has he dealt with John he's dealing with us and see amen but you got to come and then he'll reveal to you his will he's worked so when he had opened the second seal I heard the second and beasts saying come and see verse five and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see a man God wants us to come but not just come he wants us to see a man he wants us to catch the revelation of God and the will of God for our lives and his will for our lives by the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah there's something else I'll highlight just in a moment here concerning the scriptures were reading so when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and verse seven and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth thing beast say come and see I trust were seen as God wants us to see the seals but God wants to get your attention yeah let's not just come you got to come on to him but didn't you got to hear him then you got a bill even see what he wants you to see and so on it's all there in the book in the Gospel of John concerning come unto me come and see come and see I don't know if you notice that it was verse one and one is absolute just one then it was verse three perfection in the Bible three means perfection and in verse five five is Grace and seven is completion a man so I went from the fourth seal right on through to this to the to this where he went on through to the fourth but why is the fourth what we called the fourth completion because the public are dilated the fact he said that this is the first seal the second seal and the third and the fourth under the fourth seal he said the seventh seal is broken amen and he said though he said the Lord comes down he said with the revelation of the mystery of God a man to the Gentiles and the gospel going back to the Jews and brother every rehearse saw something in our lives concerning prophecy being fulfilled we can say God is fulfilling that prophecy he's going back to the Jews he's leaving the Gentiles and he's going back to the Jews grace of God to us a man so thank God that we had opened the fourth seal the voice said come and see and what did he see he said behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power power was given unto them over the part of the earth and to kill with the sword with hunger with death with beasts of the earth and so on that was the revelation of the Antichrist it wasn't Christ it was the revelation of the Antichrist even the prophecy one time he said thought it was it was Christ no he's a Santa Christ amen god help us to believe that we have come and now we see we have heard God's way of hearing and we're seeing what God wants us to see amen one more scripture revelation 22 and verse six and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy Prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel if we hear it and see it the way God wants us to hear it and see it we're going to fall down and worship you definitely a man I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which would show me these things and then said he unto me see thou do it not for him thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them that keep the sayings of this book worship God I trust were numbered with those that are keeping the sayings of the book and worshiping God by the grace of God amen it was the Prophet acknowledging the John it is the truth but we got a worship God and we'll keep the sayings of the book brothers are going to keep the sayings of the book you're going to hear it the way that God wants you to hear it and see it the way God wants you to see it a man it will bring us to obedience a man so brother especially in this age were in the false Antonius so close to the true knowing that it would deceive the very elect if possible be on your guard don't assume this is the message or this is the message the this brother is preaching the message that one's preaching the message you better be careful because it could be 99% truth and 1 percent false be on your guard and knowing that he warned the false prophets false apostles false this rising they would deceive the very elect if possible that's how close it's going to be the grace of God be with us we'll continue to walk in the light be led by the spirit so that we're gonna hear it the way God wants us to hear it and see it the way God wants us to see it praise the Lord God bless you let's stand we're marching to Zion come we that love the Lord and let our Joy's be known join in the song with sweet Accord and thus around the throne a man we're marching to Zion beautiful beautiful Zion we're marching upward to Zion by the grace of God our faith is bringing us higher and higher and higher in the revelation of Jesus I are and I are in the revelation of the mystery of God amen but you know the world don't see it but you and I see it one of these days I was going through some quotes just yesterday but the prophet of God says maybe one of these days he said this is this these are gonna go here and go there and but not come back and he said we'll wonder what happened to them he should they'll be raptured and they'll be numbered with the missing ones amen I pray God that will be numbered with the missing ones amen let's walk in the spirit rather because the spirit the Holy Spirit is there to rapturous the Holy Spirit is there to take us into eternity but we got to be in the spirit and the spirits got to be in us by the grace of God grace to us this
