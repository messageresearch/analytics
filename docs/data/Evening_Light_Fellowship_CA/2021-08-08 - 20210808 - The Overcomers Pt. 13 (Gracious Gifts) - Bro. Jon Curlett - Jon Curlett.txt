everything you've made [Music] every burning star a signal fire of grace if creation sings your [Music] of your praises you don't speak in vain no syllable empty or void for once you have spoken all nature and science follow the sound of your voice [Music] and as you speak a hundred billion creatures catch your breath evolving in pursuit of what you said if it all reveals your nature so will i i can see your heart and everything you say every pain in the sky a canvas of your grace if creation still obeys you so will i so will so [Music] god of salvation [Music] you chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride [Music] on a hill you created [Music] the light of the world abandoned in darkness to die [Music] and as you speak a hundred billion failures disappear where you lost your life so i could find it here if you left the grave behind you so will i i can see your heart and everything you've done every part designed in a work of art called love if you gladly chose surrender so will i i can see your heart a billion different ways every precious one a child you die to save if you gave your life to love them so will i [Music] like you would again a hundred billion times but what measure could amount to your desire you're the one who never leaves [Music] like you would again a hundred billion times but what measure could amount to your desire you're the one who never leaves the one behind you're the one who never leaves one behind you're the one who never leaves the one behind [Music] amen [Music] glory amen that's that's the god we serve to go of creation amen amen amen that was beautiful and just reminded what what john said in the last verse of his gospel where he said if the books were written about the things that jesus did the world couldn't contain it what god has done you know we we look around and you know like the world does they look around and all they see is death and destruction and sickness and virus and all that stuff but look at what god has done god has given us eyes to see what he's what he's done we see creation we see his hand upon us we see all the wonderful things that uh that he's done through the spoken word let's uh let's just sing um the chorus for 903 let your word be born in the manger of my heart [Music] [Music] let it live in me let it start [Music] live inside this house [Music] war [Music] amen to be born [Music] to reveal his majesty so i know if i give him control he'll be born [Music] praise the lord hallelujah let it start live inside this and house it every day let your world be born in the manger of my [Music] a place for his word to unfold but if i just yield this vessel yes lord have hallelujah way from glorion to glory he will change me day by day [Music] in me it start [Applause] live inside this house and mold it every day [Music] let [Music] is it start live inside this house [Music] [Applause] [Music] my heart heavenly father lord you see your people with lifted hands this morning lord not just singing a song lord but speaking of prayer lord our hearts desire lord of surrender even lord that your word would not just be born lord but that it would grow that it would thrive lord that it would bring forth fruits of your spirit amen lord that others could see us lord as we hold forth that worth of life and they could take lord a portion of it to themselves or that they could taste and see that the lord is good heavenly father amen lord not just our friends and families lord but the lost and dying world outside lord would have a visual lord something that they could look to and see hope lord that they could see life lord that they could see regeneration lord that they could see a chance to get away from all of this jesus lord we pray that you would just grow us a little bit more this morning lord that you would just rise us up on wings of faith lord god that you would draw us closer to you we pray lord use this vessel lord sanctified lord sanctify the ears hearing lord we know that what we are coming in expecting is what we're going to get out lord may our expectation be in line with your holy spirit lord may we have a filter of the word for everything that's said and done this morning but we ask your grace in your name we pray amen amen and amen amen god bless you thank you musicians god bless you if you'll turn in your bibles to the book of ephesians this morning i'm in the book of ephesians it seems like every service we get one or two more columbos here amen praise the lord it's good to see the the them growing in the church here so it's good to see brother ellie and brother gus here and then god bless you brother mcnelly here again as well amen it's good to have us have each one of us here this morning amen every lick of fire that we add makes a difference in the service i believe a minute for all of the same spirit the same anointing then there can only be even more things even better things happen when we all gather together amen just before we start my dad wanted to pass on thanks to the church for prayers for each one of you he said he felt that's what made the difference you know of course he nearly died in there and so he said you know pass on greetings to not only the family but the church as well for for the prayers there so we certainly think that amen sister priscilla enjoyed that special amen you gladly chose surrender and so will i amen what a line oh if we could do that day by day oh not just to him to each other you know where we put down pride where we put down selfish wants and we prefer our brother or sister over ourselves amen that's what he did amen the first fruits the first at the second adam you know the the first of many brethren he sacrificed everything he had for our for our needs to restore us back amen what a tremendous thing if we could just do it amen god help us that was good amen ephesians 4 ephesians 4 we're going to continue of course on our overcomer series this morning we read this last time but we're going to go a couple extra verses this morning and then ephesians 4 verse 4 says there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen amen in you all amen not just to the men behind the pulpit not just to the gifted ones that we see walking around but it is in you all amen this is to the overcomers this is to the church of the living god this is to the bride of christ each and every one male or female amen no matter where you're from no matter the color of your skin amen this has nothing to do with it if you have the holy ghost he is in you all amen but unto every one of us again every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men amen you can have your seats may the lord bless the reading of his word this morning amen as i said we're going to continue in our series on the overcomers and i want to take a title of gracious gifts this morning amen we're going to talk about the five-fold ministry but we're not just going to limit it to the five-fold ministry as you'll see as we go through amen but we're starting to get a transition now in this series where we've talked a lot about the preparation we've talked a lot about the the surrender we've talked a lot about the character development we've talked a lot about finding the will of god in these things and now we're starting to make the transition to where you know and you believe and god has said now is the time and now it's time to go in and really start doing your part amen that we don't just have a joshua here like we did then a great general a one man to lead us a prophet as it were but now we've got individual jobs to do and that's where we're going to start to take this as we go because we see that moses in his ministry his anointing was spread out over what a number of men to help him out in the ministry and when joshua leaves he commissions every one of those people he says go out and do the works that i did go and do the exact same thing that i did and you'll have success as long as you live your life the way that i live as long as you keep that word in your mouth as long as you meditate on it as long as you don't turn from the from the right or to the left just go straight with it he says you'll have the same success and you'll complete the work that god got me to start in this land of canaan amen but amen we're not here just to be sitting in our houses we're not here we talk about separation from the world we're not here to sit in our houses and say well i'm separate from the world and then god doesn't give us the holy ghost so that we'll sit around and do nothing but he's given it to us to operate in us so that we can be him to a dying world amen that they can have a witness that christ is alive and well today that he didn't just die on a cross he didn't just raise i mean it's a tremendous thing to say he raised but he is still alive forever more amen and he's living in a multi-member bride in this day and age amen amen so we want to be able to find our place in christ and we know that 2000 years ago jesus christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily and then after that what happened he poured everything that he was into a church body amen he pulled it poured it into a multi-member body called the mystical body of christ and that is who we are amen if you have the holy ghost in this age you are part of the members of the body of christ and then you have to be the reflection that he was in your part and your portion for this age brother branham said when we saw christ that was the most of god we could ever see in one person i mean that was the fullness in a perfect body he wasn't in a sin body and then you say well what about brother branham or something like that no he's still in a sim body he still had he still had fleshly desires he still had issues he still had complexes and if you look closely and you're looking for you'll see it in the things that he says from time to time he himself says it you know we're not going in and being critical but he brings out his mistakes over the pulpit many times he says oh i made a mistake here i meant this or i didn't quite have the revelation i've got to correct it now on these different things christ never made a mistake he never had a flaw he never had a failure in his life he was the perfect god amongst us amen and well that's the the most we'll ever see in one person but now we've got to be able to see him in portions in each and every one of us amen brother branham said this he says by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is christ which is the royal seed of abraham and heirs to everything that's in it amen everything that was in god god poured into christ everything that was in christ he poured into the believer amen god above us god with us and god in us everything every promise in the book is yours if you can believe it if you have faith enough to accept it and believe it now amen brother braham showing us he said it was god above us god the father god with us in a man called jesus christ now he says we have god in us which is the holy spirit and there is no distinction between those three we do not have three gods we have what three manifestations of god and so when he comes in us we have yet another manifestation of god amen we don't just look to a christ of 2000 years ago and say there was god in flesh but we have to be able to look to each other and look into yourself i mean it's so much easier to see it in your brother and sister sometimes but you have to be able to look in the mirror and say there is christ now amen there is the word being made manifest and look past the faults and look past the failures and say yet it is still christ within me amen that it is the the perfect word inside of me and the only thing that's hindering it is this this fleshly veil amen amen brother branham says again he says oh god if the world could only see this that god and man are one now he's not talking about himself here and we'll cover this in detail as we go further he says if the world could only see that god a man or one guess what it's not just the world has to see it we have to see it amen the church of the living god has to see it the super sign was that first man that god could come into all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church now listen he says super sign god and man together that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last days and again we want to put that on brother branham but he doesn't say that he pushes it all the way to the rest of us amen just like joshua it doesn't stop with joshua but it has to continue in the bride because if you are of him then the same works that he does you'll do also and brother branham how many times did he say the same works that christ did you do also he didn't say i do he was already doing it but he said you've got to do the same works not just ministry but laity amen the whole church is supposed to be doing the works of christ whatever it might be your portion for that age amen and so what the nominal world has missed christ in christ the word christ the word you have to look at it as the word not christ the man but christ the word and the nominal world has missed him in every age that he's come you asked them where was he ten thousand or a thousand years ago 500 years ago they can't point you to him even the church today even the lutheran church wouldn't say that luther was christ for his day would they they just say he was just another believer that you know they they don't recognize that was christ for their day and then wesley comes along and it's the same thing and then the pentecostal age that was god for their day and now he's in what he's in us and that is the last time we are the final sign brother branham's ministry was the last global sign they'll get where they could see it on tv they could see it on video and these different things we have that now but the the gifts are not the same as they were before that was their final sign to say god's here and he's calling out a bride and now it's the bride's turn to just say we're the called out ones amen and we're we're him now and that's the only place you're ever going to see him or find him yes sir brother brown continues he says now lord let it be known that thou art god and i have called this audience together at your command this is a message called the sign of the messiah now and i'm standing here not to be seen or not to try to be acting big or doing something different but it's because it's a commission charged me by an angel and confirmed by your word let it be known tonight that your jesus christ the son of god that raised from the dead and you live in your church in your people to perform and carry out the same ministry you had when you were here in the body of flesh again he's not pointing to me he says i'm not here to make something big of me but lord you dwell in your church in your people to do the same things that you were doing while you were here on earth amen the same ministry not just in a prophet not just in a five-fold ministry if we could put it that way but he says you dwell in your people which is all inclusive amen each and every one of us we have different body parts amen if we look at our bodies we have different parts they do different things it's the same in the body of christ we don't criticize our finger amen because it can't chew food no that's the function for something up here but it brings food to the mouth so it can eat and without it the mouth would have a really tough time getting food because you'd have to plop your face down in your plate and you'd make a big mess of it but that hand now can bring it to your mouth and then that will bring the energy right back to the hand to keep feeding the body in these different things so everyone has a different portion everyone has a different role and every part has to be doing what it's supposed to do in order for the body to function efficiently and perfectly amen and the lovely thing is that god has a divine order for all of this amen we don't sit here and choose it but god has made a divine order he has placed in the body all the needs that it has need all the gifts that it has need of all the abilities all the talents all of those things are there so that the body can do what it needs to do amen what is it doing it's getting the body ready for a rapture that's the only thing we're here in life that's the only thing that that's brother brahm said what do you see next he says the only thing i see is a resurrection a rapture there's nothing left to be fulfilled and then ephesians 4 will continue it says there is one body one spirit even as you are called and one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all now let's set one thing straight we said this last service but let's say it again god is in control amen in everything that he's going to say from this point on in the scripture he's reminding us at the very beginning this is god amen it's not me saying this it is god saying this it is god bringing it to you and everything that he brings from this point on that i'm talking to you about it's going to be god operating in it if it's a true gift if it's a true anointing if it's a true man if it's a true woman if it's a true child of god god is going to be the one that's in control amen god's the only one running the show he's the only one running the show and the true believer amen listen to this brother brahms says god never intended the church to be run by men god runs his church and he runs it through gifts of the spirit the gifts of the spirit is in the church to correct the spirit that's your natural spirit i mean that's the human spirit right that's your personal ideas and thoughts and memories and all these different things it's there to correct that human nature that's in you he's got five ministerial officers in his church the first of them is apostles or missionaries missionaries the highest calling there is the apostle the word missionary means one cent the apostle means one cent he says why they ever chose to be called a missionary i don't know but they are apostles that's all right apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors now that's the elected offices of god to his church now let me stop there because we see that word elected and we think well we elected a pastor we elect the ministry but that's not what he's talking about he's saying that's elected by god that was ordained by god before the foundation of the world amen and you look in the scriptures and talks about isaiah and he says i knew you before you're born in jeremiah and i knew you before you were formed in your mother's belly then and i ordained you to be a prophet unto this and that the ministry is ordained before the foundation of the world and you can't make a man a minister and you can't make a man not a minister amen that is the go the working of god amen and it has to be there so you don't elect a pastor god creates a pastor amen you don't elect an evangelist god creates an evangelist you don't elect an apostle you don't elect a prophet they are whether you accept them or not amen amen so a man cannot be elected into an office by people he either is or he isn't and it is god's doing not his doing that's going to do it amen now the people's thoughts are ideas about that man sure it's going to have an impact but it doesn't determine whether or not that man is gifted in the ministry amen i've seen people do it they'll put a man behind the pulpit that wasn't meant to be there and all of a sudden what happens is the church comes to a screeching halt because that man was not ordained for that position doesn't mean he's not a minister for instance but maybe he's not a pastor and then so he comes in he tries to pastor and what he's doing is he's blowing up the church because an evangelist will come in he'll stir up the waters and then he's getting all the trash out but you get a church that's always constantly being riled up and they never get settled and then they have to be established on the word so you get an evangelist behind the pulpit that's not going to work very long for a pastor the church will be up in arms and you'll have a you'll have an altar call every service but you'll never have any any stability they won't know who they are they'll be constantly questioning it because his goal is to keep sin out of the camp rather than to establish the people amen which is the work of a pastor and a teacher they establish the people the evangelist comes in and gets sing kicked out so you have a very clean church but they'll have very shallow roots and then that's not the best thing when the storms of life come amen amen so we've got to be careful in these things amen other times people see a charisma they see a gift to speak they see a man that's very gifted in the word that knows the word and i've met many men in my life that are very very deep into the word they can quote scripture they can quote quotes they can tell you that the page they can tell you the paragraph number and they know the mysteries of god they have a deep understanding not just intellectually but by life experience amen and people look at them and they say you should be a minister and that man if he's not careful he'll sit there and he'll start to think about it and all of a sudden he says you know what i should be a minister and he gets up behind the pulp but in the words his brother mark likes to say they come over and they drop flat right there because he's not anointed doesn't mean he doesn't know the word amen doesn't mean he can't be a help using the word in the body but he is not a minister in it and you see it very quickly the words come over the pulpit and the people don't receive it because it's him it's not the lord that's anointed it amen god chooses the men for the ministry and he chose them before the foundation of the world amen when i stood up here in november and those three brothers ordained me they did not say this makes john a minister what they were doing was they were recognizing the gift and they were affirming that they believe it to be a gift and they were saying and we will use this now in the local body all they were doing was giving recognition to what god had already done to work in him and and that's then to show the people that there is a support not only of the pastor before the elders of the church to say that this is a gift that's been brought here by god and we need to use it and we need to heed it and let god grow it and let it be for the edification of the body amen they didn't make me a minister i was a minister before i ever stepped up here but the recognition of them now gives me authority to stand behind this pulpit and what preached to you as a man of god that's all they're doing is they're saying we're going to allow him in here we recognize what god's doing in his life and that's to our benefit and we're going to use it now in the local body amen amen but this is not just about a five-fold ministry we're talking about today i want to settle that because we're going to be talking about the five-fold ministry but there's so many things that we're ascribing to the five-fold ministry alone and it was never meant only for the five full ministry amen it was meant for every child of god the same rights the same power the same authority the same privileges of a child of god are given to each one different gifts but listen the gift of healing is not only for one man amen that the gift of casting out demons is not only for ministry that can be anyone that does it can be a mom sitting at her home it can be a dad sitting at his desk wherever it might be those things are given to the church collectively and we'll read a quote where brother brahm talks about it here he says listen he says then in each local church in each local church amen what we have needed for our day-to-day work is already here and if it's not here god will bring it here right he says then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that is knowledge wisdom gifts of healing working in miracles speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and all these things go in each local body and every person in the church has an individual ministry every person in the church your body has nothing in it that's not needed and just like that the local body has nobody here that isn't needed and if you think you're not needed then you don't understand something yet amen you need god to open your eyes and say you do have a purpose you do have a benefit you know you're young people you think well i'm just a young kid what can i do hey you can help the other young people i mean you can encourage them you can be friends with them you can bring them into the fold you can you can be a witness to the the kids in your school these different things no matter your age amen you've got a ministry if you have the holy ghost because god gave you the the holy ghost to do what be dynamic i mean not to be static but to be dynamic to be moving to doing things that he's wanting you to do amen and then often what i feel is we've we rely too much on the men behind the pulpit and what happens is they turn into a crutch for the people and the people don't develop their own faith they don't develop their own stability they don't develop their own roots what happens is they just say well i'm just going to run to the gifted man of god right and that was never what god intended amen he intended you to walk by what faith right to step out in faith to speak in faith to believe what he has said and to move according to that amen and then the men of god there will see what they're they're there to do to to kind of encourage that amen amen but we all have a common ministry and and uh i was reading some things from brother lonnie jenkins the other day and he touched on this and i thought it was worthwhile to bring to the church and this is second corinthians 5. verse 16 says wherefore henceforth now we know no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more what he's saying is jesus christ and the body's gone he's not here for us to know to touch to feel to talk to in the same way he says therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who had both reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and had given to us the ministry of reconciliation amen amen paul's saying the ministry that we have now is one of reconciliation brother bam talks about it like the pawn shop you're standing in the pawn shop and what happens was christ goes in and redeems you and takes you out and he says the ministry now is to bring you back to your proper position which it was in eden amen where you walked with him you had full authority eternal life and constant communion with god amen he says to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation so he says christ did it and now we are coming we have the exact same word of reconciliation and that's to bring the people back to their original place he says now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's dead be reconciled to god amen he says and have given us the ministry of reconciliation and then he says the word of reconciliation and that's our common call each and every one of us is looking to what get the last one in aren't we because when the last one comes in we can go amen so we're looking to get everyone brought in that can be brought in and to do that we have to reconcile them we have to show them not who they were you know what they look like when they see in the mirror those sorts of things but we have to show them their eternal amen we have to show them what they were before they ever came into a realization before they ever came into this body of flesh that they were a part of the word that god has a seed inside of them and he's looking to grow that into him amen so that's our common goal now that word reconciliation means restoration to favor restoration to favor because when we were in sin and trespasses he gave his life for us but we did not have favor with him amen it's under the shed blood that we get that favor when we get the holy ghost that's a sign that he's recognized what we've done as he asked amen and now he's given us something to take us into a rapture he's put he's put the earnest of our of our rapture inside of us and that's what an eternal part of god his very life within us so the question is are we in the ministry of reconciliation now that's a little difficult for a sister to say yes to because it happens primarily by what the preaching of the word the primary tool that god uses for these things is the preaching of the word amen faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word amen that word hearing means understanding it means a revelation of god's will amen that comes by hearing the word so the majority of that is done by a five-fold ministry it's not done necessarily by you and your jobs you can testify to these things but you're not ministering that so how do you get into a ministry of reconciliation well the thing is you put your shoulder to the wheel of somebody that's doing the ministry of reconciliation amen that's what you're doing here this morning is you're putting your shoulders to the wheel and you're saying i'm going to get in there and i'm going to support the man of god in the preaching of the word he's going to help build me up and i can go in and help build somebody else up as well when i go out amen i'm rejuvenated i'm strengthened i've got courage i've got boldness i've got a word and due season to give the person that next crosses my path amen but you've got to be able to support the one that's here in the first place amen that's what he said is you got to put your shoulder to the wheel behind somebody that's doing that work already amen amen if you can't do it support somebody else that is and brother paul shared a sermon on brother perry greens the other day and i was listening to that and he said you know i figure in order to criticize what someone's doing you at least need to have done more than them you know because we can get really critical can we and especially when it comes to ministry and even worse sometimes minister to minister any and i thought what he said was very good he says if you haven't done more than them don't criticize because you don't have the experience to even criticize them to see what it's like to walk the path they've walked to see the pain they go through the sacrifice they go through the criticism they have to face from unbelievers much less believers so he said don't criticize unless you've done more than the person you're criticizing i think most of us would be very very quiet the rest of our lives amen certainly about those that are ahead of us in life's path amen now i mentioned i wanted to clarify something i mentioned something in in service a while back ago where i said you know i was talking about being at your post of duty and i you know we've got people listening and streaming our services regularly and that wasn't aimed at them by any means you know they're in a place where they don't have a church they can't attend a church and so we understand those things amen but when we talk about being at your post of duty i'm talking about people that can and don't i mean that's what that's what that was for is people that have a local church that have a local pastor two pastors three pastors and they choose not to go to any one of those because something's wrong there because god can't be wrong so it means you're either not where you're supposed to be as in you're in the wrong place you're living in the wrong place because god's provided two three four pastors in the area and you say well i can't go there well then neither you're wrong or god's wrong and guess what god ain't wrong so you're either in the wrong place or you need to be in one of those churches whether you want to or not amen because god has provided for you and that means that if you're not be if you're choosing not to go there then there's an issue with you it's not with him amen listen to this this is brother brown he's talking about the queen of sheba and she's she was wondering about solomon's great gift of wisdom it said but that little queen wanted it she wanted to go there and experience it but the first thing she wanted to know was it's scriptural or not she studied all the scriptures and then she said i'm going to do another thing i'm a queen and if that message is right i'm going to support it and she laid in camels with gold and myrrh and frankincense and all kinds of costly apparel and such she said if it's right if that god is the real god then i'm going through with this thing then i'm through with this thing i've been serving and i'm going to support it with everything i've got now that it is not a man that it is not solomon's gift of wisdom that it is god in a man she's not there to support a man she's there to support man in the the god that's inside of the man amen and so what happens when we sit back and we say well i won't go to church because i don't agree with the pastor or the pastors is we sit there and we stream from somebody else and we take and we take and we take and we take and you know what happens to people that only take yeah they get selfish they get selfish and what they do is they deprive the local body of their lick of fire of their experience of their support of their fellowship and so they turn self-righteous eventually and critical to the point where almost nobody can ever minister to them because the scripture talks about his iron sharper than iron amen and that's what fellowship that's what's going to a local body is going to do is it's going to sharpen you up because people will hold you accountable to the word you don't get to sit in your house all comfortable listening to services day after day after day amen what'll happen is even the one you're listening to will eventually become no good to you amen you've got to be a part of a local body amen if it's at all possible amen critical and self-righteous is the end of people that sit at home and don't support anybody amen it's not the place we want to be brother brahm continues he says that's the attitude listen god's not concerned so much about your money but he wants you to support him with all you are amen amen he don't want 10 of your money that doesn't mean stop paying ties amen but he says that's not his goal is to get you to pay ties he gets you to pay tie so he can bless you that's why he gives you a tithe he gives you an option for thai so that he can bless you it's not to bless him it's to bless you amen so much as he wants your time your talent your testimony and all that you are to be given into his hands so he can control you he wants to be your lord not only your savior but your lord lordship to govern you amen not just your money but he wants the rest of you as well amen god wants the whole package right and it's for your good and it's for the good of the brother and sister sitting next to you and those pews amen listen to this we need anointed ministry amen every church needs it and i feel for those that haven't found it yet or are struggling to find it amen it's god's grace if they can find it but listen god has a way to provide and this is luke 10 2. i mean there's not you know you start talking about you know ministers inside of canada and bringing somebody in or something like that there's not many available you know we we have a dearth of ministers so to speak there's not a ton of them out there and jesus said it was going to be this way in luke 10 2. he says therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few amen he said he said he'd send what his angels to harvest what are angels messengers ministry he says pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvest amen we're at our harvest time this is the end of all things amen and so we need those laborers we need the ministry to be going through and what harvesting the people as they come to maturity amen bringing them up to that maturity so that when the rapture comes they're ready to go amen but those that are watching online that don't have a pastor let me say it to you this way he has told you how to get a pastor he's told you how to get a ministry and he says pray ye pray ye right who's ye that's the laity that's the congregation that needs a minister to come in he says pray ye to who the lord of the harvest the one that ordains these men the one that prepares him specifically for a chosen body right he says pray to him and then expect it because there's a need there for it if you've got a harvest that needs to be taken pray that he's going to send somebody in to handle it amen there is a lord of the harvest and there's somebody ready but you got to pray and you got to pray and you got to pray and you got to pray and in the meantime don't walk away stay and pray stay and pray stay and pray until what a laborer comes to help you with the harvest amen i love how the word gives us he shows us the need and he shows us how to get it how to get an answer right he didn't say oh there's going to be there's not going to be enough ministers and some people aren't going to make a rapture no he says pray pray pray pray pray pray pray and then somebody will come in amen he's not going to leave you without somebody to help you through this amen he's prepared somebody but he's looking for you to do something and that's pray to the lord of the harvest amen amen let's continue with this idea that christ is the head of the church amen ephesians 4 7 says but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men amen we have different measures of grace and that's in proportion to the gift of christ himself christ was the great gift amen he was the great gift that was that was god himself sacrificing everything that he could for us and then as we read he poured all of that into the church so he separates christ separates himself into all the little portions that are the individuals in you know ellie has a portion and josh has one and kingsley has one sister maureen brother mark and everyone in here when he gives you the holy ghost he gives you a portion of god and he's ordained you to do that to do something for him from before the foundation of the world amen but paul's saying look it's grace to you that he gave it to you in the first place amen so whatever you have that is godly that is spiritual that is of eternal value is god's grace to you amen amen and then he says after that he gave gifts to men so there's a different proportion based of grace based on the proportion of god that you have and some of us have more of god to express amen we talked about that before some of us have a more difficult life some of us face family issues we face health issues we face financial issues we face mental issues all marital issues whatever it might be we face these things and it's the grace of god that rises up within us that gives us what we have need of to meet the challenge for our particular life amen but he's also talking about look there are different levels of gifts so let me put it this way we've got brother gerald here and we've got me so brother gerald can preach better than me and it's more grace to him that he can do that because it's more grace required to operate something of god in a way that is effective to people because for it to be effective god has to get less of you into the picture and more of him into the picture and that takes grace because there's nothing in us that's human that would want to minimize ourselves when something supernatural is coming over the pulpit amen so it is more grace to him to operate that way so that more of god can come out like we said before the grace is there to minimize man and maximize god in that gift amen and the greater the gift that means there's more of god and less of you and it's grace grace grace from start to finish to do those sort of things amen brother branham said my gift is to get myself out of the way that was grace so that brother adam would get to the point where he didn't even know the words that he was speaking nor could he can remember them after he spoke them because god was so completely using his body his mind his lips that he was he was effectively unconscious in that moment he'd say was it right what he said was it right he didn't even know he wasn't even aware of it that's how separated he was from his faculties when god used him amen that's a gift and that's grace that's to him to so separate himself that way so that god could use him in that way amen listen amen that's what you want an anointed minister get a man that can pull himself back amen that it isn't about him and then it's not about building himself up it's not putting on a show like brother bram says i'm not here to make something big about myself but to completely pull myself out of the way so that god can come through in a way that he's never come through before amen god help us god help us listen let's take paul's words for don't take my word for it let's go back to the scripture paul says this first corinthians 15 10 he says but by the grace of god i am what i am amen amen he is the prophet to the age he's the prophet to the gentiles he is the word carrier for that age nobody gets to correct paul right the holy spirit gave paul everything that we have in the new testament effectively right peter has to run it by paul you could put it that way right peter had to get corrected by paul peter who has the keys to the kingdom still had to be corrected by paul that's that's how tight got that paul is with god okay and he says but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all he says then all the apostles then all of the believers then all of the disciples he says i worked harder than all of them you say that doesn't sound very meek listen to the next one he says yet not i but the grace of god which was with me paul says look i did more than any of you nobody can touch me and we think arrogance arrogance i did more than anybody i spoke in more tongues i did more signs and wonders i have an angel that follows me around nobody can touch my ministry and he says i've worked harder than any one of you i've been more diligent i've put more time in i've been i've been whipped more times than any of you right i've sacrificed more nobody can touch my ministry and then he says what not i but the grace of god which is in me you think he's talking about himself there you know that we have something to do well i'm more diligent i spend more time in the message i spend more time studying paul says whatever you've done he says it is all by grace amen so you say oh well this brother is very disciplined that's why he is where he is no it's the grace of god to him amen this brother has a gift of this and that it's because he fasts and he prays it no no no paul says it is all grace he says the grace of god which was what with me it's grace from start to finish amen so if you think you're something big think again because it's grace that started it's grace is going to finish it and you can't do a thing about it amen you can't add to it and you can't take away from it amen amen if you think that you've got anything of eternal value in this flesh in and of yourself you've got a real you need to rethink it amen there is nothing we can add to this but it is what god has done and it is what is god will do it's all by grace it's all by grace from start to finish amen he continues in first corinthians three he says now he that planteth and he that watereth are one so he's talking about the gifts because who goes in first it's always a missionary isn't it in those days it would be a missionary would go in first an apostle would go in and they would do what they'd preach they'd go in the marketplace they'd get beat up thrown in jail whatever it was but eventually a church would start there and they would plant and they says he that water so then you get the evangelists come in and the teachers and eventually they get a pastor there he says they're watering the work that the first one started he says they are one that what that means is that they are equal they are equal there is no great ones amongst us amen when it comes to the ministry he says the one that plants the one that waters doesn't matter they're all equal in terms of god amen he says and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor and then so we answer to god for what we do and what we don't do and how we do it now he says for we are laborers together with god so he's talking about the five full ministry we are laborers together with god so god is working with us to do the work but he says ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building amen so we are doing the work with god but we don't get to claim you amen so brother gerald serving here for 40 years does not get to say this is mine that's what paul's saying he's saying ye are god's husbandry that husbandry it means i've got a mark down here somewhere what is it what do you say yes he says god's husbandry is his garden his field his cultivation so this is all god's and all you have is brother gerald that is working with god to do what to grow it but your gods amen the pastor doesn't own the people you can leave this church and go to another church and that's not that shouldn't be a problem to the pastor because you're god's building you're god's husbandry you're his working you're his people and all you have is a five full ministry that's there to do what to help it to move as god will move him to move to help that thing to be successful to be to be a healthy church amen verse 10 says according to the grace of god which is given to me as a wise master builder so paul says i'm the master builder i'm setting the foundation for all of the ages amen this is paul's foundation here perfect light to start and he says i'm setting a foundation and it's god's grace to me to be a master builder i have laid the foundation and another builds thereon what happens sometimes we get real sticky about oh well i started it and now somebody else taken the credit for it paul says look i i started it and everyone's going to build on it that's okay that's the purpose he's supposed to as a prophet the age he's there to set that foundation so that what comes afterwards is going to stand the test of time he says but let every man take heed how he built it thereon for other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is jesus christ he laid a foundation of jesus christ amen amen he preached christ amen and in the resurrection the power and these things he said i didn't come to you with fine words swelling words he said by came in power and demonstration of the spirit to show you what jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever because he knew that if he didn't do that then they build it up on him and then they build it up on his gifts they build it up on his ideas and it will crumble and fall but he says no build it on christ amen and he says make sure anything you build on is built on christ amen amen that's what brother branham could say he says i've only preached what paul preached amen because what he preached was what jesus christ was saying yesterday today forever he took it back to paul he didn't create new doctrine he took it back to what paul brought to us because that was what the holy spirit brought to the gentile church amen amen what happened the ones that didn't build on christ what happened yeah right within 60 odd years they were what denominationalized right you had the start of nickelodeon-ism and all of a sudden you had a bunch of men's ideas to got to the point where they wouldn't even allow john to come and preach in their church i mean you got a you got a man that that that that was close to christ that has the visions of the of the ending of the world and they won't allow him to come preach in their church that's where it got to was because what men got in and they set up their own programs their own platforms and they built something that wasn't on christ and it all has crumbled and fallen and then you've got a denominational world today amen amen so to who is to who were these gifts given it says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men and he gave some not everyone he gave some apostles he gave some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers we don't have all five of those here today do we we've got two we've got a pastor and we've got an evangelist right now right but we have access to those others don't we we can fly them in we could stream them if we chose to do something like that but they are available to us but he says look i give some this so there's a couple of things here there's two ways to look at this because he gave thought he gave men five different gifts amen so you can be an apostle you can be a prophet you could be an evangelist a pastor or a teacher and those are gifts that he gave to men he gave to fivefold ministers amen so he gave something down to them distinct gifts that were for use in the body but the other side of this is that they weren't just given to the men but the men themselves are now a gift to the body of christ amen because he gave some apostles he gives some of us an apostle to bring us in he gives some of us a prophet amen the people that started you know the early church they were listening to brother mark in these ones they're listening to what a prophet right they're reading a prophet and that was their access to god at that point and then they come in and they sit in under a pastor and the church gets started in these different things but the starting point was one person or another and guess what not everybody can take an apostle some people need a teacher some people need a pastor because they've got life problems that he needs to address and they see god in that then they get an evangelist that comes in and he just he just sparks their conscience and they're like whoa i really need to make a change and they realize they're not where they they should be and they give their life to christ and so we all if we looked at our testimonies some of us came in under evangelism some of us came in under pastoral work some of us came in under listening to tapes right whatever it might be each one of us was given a gift of a man in the form of a ministry to bring us in and then once we're in then he gives us a gift of a man or man to keep us feeding and growing and then so we have a gift given to men and then those men themselves are gifts to the bride of christ to grow them amen and that's why i call this gracious gifts is because paul says every one of us what we have is grace to us and then if you can accept what we have it's grace to you as well amen it's grace to those men that they can even operate under those gifts and not get swelled heads and then because you will see things that happen in those services and i can even say for myself not knowing what happens in a service not knowing situations somebody comes and says you went right into my life you went right into a situation i don't know i know you don't know anything about now i could sit back and say oh yeah that's amazing wow i'm great no i don't have a clue i didn't have a clue so why would i get swelled up about it but what happens is if you start listening to those things and dwelling on it you'll get a swelled head because you'll think well i got in the spirit right i put the time out no no it's grace brothers and sisters it is grace from start to finish amen and god help us if we ever start to look to ourselves instead of the one that anointed us in the first place amen amen i'm trying to get our heads in the right place when it comes to ministry not because we're not in the right place but we want to keep a level ahead with these things because when gifts come in amen when god starts moving we tend to turn to the men rather than the god that sent them in and that's always the problem with the church amen so what why do they come verse 12 says for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry and for the edified of the body of christ amen let's start with that perfecting of the saints i mentioned this before i'll say it again because not everyone was here i was listening to brother jason demar speak on this and he said be careful here because when we see this word perfecting we think it's about maturing he says this is not the same word you know jesus said be therefore perfect as i am perfect this ain't the same perfection because there jesus was saying be mature as i am mature but here this perfecting means different and it means a complete furnishing or equipping so in other words the faithful ministry is here to give you what you need to become mature they're not here to make you mature they're here to give you what you need to become mature because it's god that's going to do the work we're just here to support it amen so we're just feeding you we're giving you the nutrients we're giving you the tools we're giving you the inspired preaching of the word to help you to step into what you're supposed to be doing amen so it's for you to take it now in the holy spirit and you quickens it and that gives you life i can't give you life brother joe can't give you life speaking over the pulpit all we can do is preach under the inspiration and that holy spirit and you will quicken it and make it what it needs to be inside of your life amen so what are we here to provide we're here to provide you with with inspired preaching that meets the need in your life on a regular basis amen if your pastor if the preacher behind the pulpit is not meeting the needs of your life something's wrong because that's what he's promised to do we're here for the perfecting of the saints we're here for the equipping of the saints so if the ministry is not equipping you we've got a problem and it's either in the pulpit or it's either or it's in the pew or maybe it's both amen but that's why we've got to be praying for each other amen like i said but at the start of the service you come in and you get what you expect amen so if we come in expecting nothing guess what you get nothing so sometimes it's an expectation issue sometimes it's an anointing issue i've talked about i've been in churches i shared with some brothers what happened back in texas where they put a man in that should not have been in that pulpit a year and a half later he was gone and out in the world they shouldn't have done it and guess what that church was not blessed while he was there in fact it did more damage than if they just left him out and streamed somebody else why he wasn't supposed to be there amen so there can be an issue there amen but like i said it's here to do what to meet the need in your life on a regular basis now that is not saying that it's going to be intellectually stimulating i mean that's going to cause you to think i mean that's that's tickling your ears preaching so often we say oh whoa that really stuck no no no it's the holy spirit we want moving not just a wow i got to think about that for a little while a little while that's not what we're looking for that's good we want you to think we want you to meditate on these things but so often what you'll see especially in denominations is you'll see a preacher that gets up and he preaches something that just makes you feel good amen that that just reaffirms something to you rather than challenges you and you walk out and he hasn't really put a finger on your life at all he's just said something that kind of makes you go away and say hmm that was pretty good no that's not we're not looking for pretty good we're looking for the holy spirit to come in and put his finger right on your life on a regular basis and not only your life but my life even the man while he's preaching the holy spirit isn't just preaching from here to there he's preaching in the entire congregation amen my wife has said many times how are you able to say that i said well he was preaching to me too right because she'd say you're talking about something that you deal with in your own life i said right exactly i still got to say it because it's the word but that doesn't mean that i don't get to i don't have to sit there and consider my own life even while these words are going forth amen it's a real challenge sometimes to say the things i do because i know that i need it as much as the people in the in the congregation doing man amen provide you with inspired preaching second challenge and inspire your faith by showing you your place and your promises in the word of god amen we're looking to reconcile you we're looking to return you back to your position of favor with god and so we've got to show you what's available we've got to show you what he said about you amen what he promised for you and hopefully get you to do what step out in faith amen not my faith but your faith that your faith will be lifted up to the place where you can rest on what god has called you to do amen i want to read this quote i read the first part a few services ago but the second part is what i really wanted to get to so he says here and the word of god will defeat satan any place any time anywhere and on any condition that's right that's what it is it's god's word heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail away he says believe it so we're here and we're preaching the word and brother brahm says the word will defeat him anyplace anywhere anytime on any condition but then he says gifts are added to stimulate faith so the preaching of the word is coming forth and then he says there are gifts added to that to stimulate the faith of the hearer he says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word that's where faith comes by hearing the word of salvation so the in ministry and the five full ministry are given gifts to stimulate your faith as you're hearing the word and so you have some brothers have a gift of what healing right and so when they're preaching they're building up faith they're stimulating the faith that you already have that you don't know about right they're stimulating it to the point where you can say not just i can be healed but i am healed amen to where you have a need for deliverance and all of a sudden you're sitting there uh somebody was talking about brother allen stuckless the other day and he was sitting in service and it and his chest was hurting and brother gerald was preaching and all of a sudden it came to him just claimed your healing and he claimed his healing and he never had a heart problem after that what is it it's there to stimulate something inside of you that god placed there to what answer to the word and bring you up into a higher plane amen a higher plane of health a higher place of your mental thinking a higher place in your marriage a higher place whatever the need might be it's there to stimulate your faith not to get you to think i'm a great man not to get you to think that brother gerald's a great man or ron spencer or timber no no it's there to stimulate their faith your faith it's there for you for your benefit to draw you to a higher place amen and then it's there to cause you to rejuvenate to grow your faith to step up to a higher level amen they're not there for you to lean on day in and day out they're there to get you to stop leaning amen to stop leaning so that you can start speaking so that you can start believing so you can start walking and you don't have to come to church for god to move in your life why because he stimulated your faith and now you've got to walk that you can continue now the next time you come in he'll try and raise it a little bit higher and the next time a little bit higher and all of a sudden we're all growing together and all we're here is stimulating what you already have going on in your life on a day-to-day basis based on what your personal relationship with god your devotions your prayer time your listening to tapes your listening service whatever it might be he's there to just stimulate what is already in you amen amen you have the eternal god inside of you there's no limit to what he can do if you will believe and all we're trying to do is get you to believe amen brother brown says this he says you hear such things today there's a great healer coming to town and he there will all go over and get healed if i was gonna say brother branham's coming to to our service on wednesday does anybody in here think that they would walk out without what they were dealing with taken care of no right why because we've seen it we know that brother branham had a gift of healing he also had a gift to inspire faith so my personal opinion is if we knew brother branham was coming into our next service we'd be pulling in everyone that we know of that had a need and we'd be coming in with a laundry list of things that we wanted god to take care of because brother branham's coming to town isn't that true that's what we'd say brother brahm says now when you think that you all know it i saw you he says now when you think that way you've certainly got your camera out of focus yes sir focus it down to jesus and him only look to him and you'll see what god's purpose is because brother brahm says i am not the healer he says i heal you if i could but i can't i've got to wait for him to tell me amen i've got to pray the prayer of faith but he's the one that's got to do the healing what is it the man of god is coming into the service to remind you that you're a man of god that you're a child of god that you're a daughter of god that you're a woman of god he's trying to remind you of your position and your place and get you to look to your father not to him amen he's there to stimulate your faith not to take the place of it not to take the place of the god that brought him there in the first place and gave him that gift amen he's trying to show you that man's trying to come in and show you that you have rights you have privileges the same as he has and you don't need him and so the thing is the next time something comes up you don't have to go to brother branham you don't have to go to brother gerald you don't have to go to brother jonathan you don't have to go to brother iran but you go to the god that sent them in the first place and say i'm coming to you because he said i am your child amen that you have given me the holy ghost and what i have need of i go to you for it i don't have to wait for a man amen i've been seeing my place i know who i am and i'm coming to my jehovah rapha amen i'm coming to my jehovah's shama my jehovah nisi amen you are the one i'm coming to he says get your eyes off the man look to the god behind the man that's what they missed with brother branham they said they don't see the angel behind the angel i mean they don't see the one standing behind me they kept looking at him and when he walked away what happened all the miracles faded because what they were looking to the man amen but jesus didn't leave amen he's still here the holy spirit's still here amen only believe if thou canst believe all things are possible amen amen we don't want to look to man a guy says you've got your focus wrong he says focus it down to jesus guess what you can be in the middle of your day and have a need what are you going to do you're going to call brother gerald you're driving down the road you're going to call brother gerald what do you say jesus help me that's it he hears you every time he's available 24 7. hey man he doesn't shut his phone off like i do at 10 p.m right look to jesus amen the author and finisher of your faith amen amen hallelujah [Applause] good word amen the third thing we do is we bring correction by the word of god to get you to keep you from getting caught up in satan's tricks what is satan's trick to get you into formalism he's trying to get you into a place where you do the same thing day in and day out and you don't grow saints tricks are not black and white like i said before they're nearly white they're one word off from truth that's what they are and all he's looking to do is get you off one word at a time one day at a time so that by the end you're off by just a couple degrees and you miss it all together amen what is it the five full ministry puts the word in front of you without excuse and says this is the way the truth and the life walk you in it amen day in and day out they're trying to raise you to that higher plane amen because what the word is dynamic the word doesn't change amen the word is unchanging but the revelation of that word is growing and opening up day in and day out and that ought to have an effect if you've been walking the good old gospel away for 30 years and you're the same as you were there's a problem amen we never stop growing brother gerald has confirmed it to me he's the oldest one here and he hasn't stopped growing yet right god is constantly growing us and changing us from glory to glory to glory and until we go in a rapture and until we go down into the earth we're never going to stop and if we stop brother brown says the minute you stop you're backslidden amen so what is it god is constantly working on us to do what grow into his image and we've got to do that we can't be stagnant the ministry can't stay stagnant preach the same thing over and over again we've got to dig in we've got to pray we've got to humble ourselves we've got to get down before god and say god we need more to bring more amen we can't preach just because the word says we need to preach by experience amen i'm just you know i'm 41 years old that's tough to preach my experience sometimes because there's a lot of stuff i haven't experienced yet now i have to preach that by faith those areas and trust that god will back up his word amen but we're looking for experience amen we want to have him in our lives doing the things that he said he would do brother says this he says and look at our pen we're talking about remember getting caught up in satan's tricks which take you into formalism and look at our pentecostal message today in preaching and our people letting down constantly even normal little things they wouldn't even get on the foundation of common decency i think what sister priscilla said the other day when i was talking about so just seeing some church services and stuff and she says they even lack common decency now in a nominal church today i mean they're shouting they're dancing they're wearing all sorts of clothes tatted up you know they got hairstyles i mean ministers standing there wearing tight pants and five thousand dollar pairs of yeezy sneakers and a gold chain okay that's not even decent for a man of god to be doing something like that that's where they've gone he says it here he says then how can we claim we're going to claim the holy ghost he says it's time brother no wonder the world says you ain't got what you claim to have now i'm not preaching to us here i'm just warning us it doesn't take long to get there he says we're presuming it we're taking the name of pentecost without living the life of pentecost this is 1962. he's preaching the pentecostal churches he's saying you ain't it he says a life of pentecost the original pentecost this is what we want this is what we claim to have a life of pentecost is a consecrated life filled with the holy ghost rich and royal till there's nobody can put a finger on you that's real pentecost he says what why would you want to substitute why would the devil trick you into something like that what is brother brahman saying he's saying the life of pentecost the real life is what a holy ghost fire that'll burn out every bit of the world that's in you it'll burn out the influence of the world it'll burn out the desire of the world it'll burn out every bit of unbelief and make you live a life that nobody can put a finger on by the word by the word not by their ideas but they point to that word and say you're you're a consecrated man or woman of christ you're a sanctified man or woman in christ you have the life of christ you're not just like him you are him amen amen amen and that's a big job the ministry has i mean there's no playing around with this you don't just get up here and play preacher you don't play pastor of these things it's a serious serious thing when you start looking at this and then you remember the the seven sons of siva right and they presume they said what well we adjure you by christ who paul preaches he says christ i know paul i know who are you and then he did what ran them down the street tearing their clothes off till they were naked he exposed them for what they were which was men that were following men without a personal experience with the christ that they professed amen amen what is it for those ministry we've got to get down on our knees and say god use us use us use us because we can't do this on our own i'll never be able to help you on my own i'll lead you down the garden path and i'll waste your time all day long it may sound good it may look good but it won't be god unless he takes me and uses me and molds me and sets me aside amen and it's no same thing with brother gerald for the past 40 years that has to be god that can use a man because we get in our own way every single time otherwise amen says this he says now god said i sent them the word eve just walked right over the top of it and disbelieved it i made it manifest and they crucified it was saying every time i send it they mess it up or they they ignore it or they reject it he says i'm getting tired i'm coming myself he's not talking about christ in flesh 2000 years ago he says so here he come god in you amen it was external to eve they walk with him in the cool of the evening right it wasn't in her it was with her then christ comes down and now he's walking amongst them and they can't accept him either so now he says i've got to finish this and the only way to do it is to be in them so they can't deny me because i'm in them right i'm a part of them right they can't deny themselves right i'm going to step into them god above us the pillar of fire god with us in jesus christ god in us the holy spirit what is it he says it's the same word the same god amen no more trusting in anything else god come himself this was a man-sized job so he brought it on down he come down himself they won't this is what it looks like when he comes down they won't have nothing have to do nothing about it and just let them surrender to me and i'll walk in them talk in them speak in them work in them oh my that's it i'll do the work just let them humble themselves just let them empty up i'll just beat my enemy out through there through them that's it you can't do it yourself now you're not a match for him but if you'll just let god do it get the word in you then it will be taken care of that's where the fivefold ministry has to stand it ain't me don't look to me he's got to do it through me that's the only way it's ever going to work amen and i love what he says here this is not he's not speaking to fivefold ministry here he's talking to every son and daughter of god amen and the reason i know that is he now comes down he's he addresses the fivefold ministry in the next quote the next portion of the quote he says now god fortified his army he was just talking about his army and that's every single one of us they says now god fortified his army with what himself himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was god doing listen did you ever think what that offices of the church is it's god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer for see before satan ever gets to it he's done told it what is it god dressed up in his church these offices is god's dress where when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's god's dress where god's presence god's spirit working through man now that sounds wonderful to be a minister now doesn't it nope it's a wonderful thing you say brother jonathan it's too much you make yourself god i didn't make myself god and i'm not i'm not saying it in that way brother branham said that and brother branham's not making himself god because what jesus said it not brother branham right john 10 this is the jew speaking jesus they said the jews answered him saying for our good work we stone thee not they said you've done all these good things we're not stoning you or threatening to stone you for that but for blasphemy and because thou being a man maketh thyself god they said you're not allowed to be god a man can't be god jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken amen so jesus says the standard to be called a god is does the word come to you amen remember that what paul said when he was correcting them he says did the word come to you or did the word come from you right it comes to you and he says here jesus said those unto the to the word of god came our gods that's not just five full ministry word of god comes to every child of god amen and then it comes out of them and that's what they were doing was they were confusing the coming out as if they had something to do with it but the word of god comes to you that's what makes you the word of god amen amen amen the word of god comes to us all in some form or fashion amen and as long as it comes out after it comes in then you've got god and if you've got god that effectively makes you god and i'll read the quotes where he says it but he's pushing them back to psalms 82 6 amen he says i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high what is it gods what do they have you know men you know humans have human babies gods have got babies yes that's all he's saying you're a child of god that makes you a god that doesn't make you the god that doesn't mean you are the supreme authority but he says you are god's you are children of god and that makes you gods that's your inheritance is to be a god and then he says he's going to put us over all the kings and kingdoms and and all these different things in the world to come what we're going to rule and reign over everybody we are going to be in a position of god amen what is it the word comes to the word god comes to god god comes to the one that was a part of him before the foundation of the world amen and then what happens is that light comes forward and that light and the word springs out and all of a sudden you've got god manifesting in your midst but only in a portion only in a portion and that's what trips us up amen listen to this this is an incredible quote brother brown says if he is in you he's the power of god live by it he's god in you the bible said ye become gods is that right aren't you all gods and jesus said it too the pharisees there said you make yourself god he said isn't it written in your law that ye are god's he now listen to this he says he made moses a god to pharaoh now moses was a god to the people as well because they couldn't remember they chose they said we can't take the glory of god when he came down the mountain they said moses you be god and that's when god did it but he says before moses ever became a god to the people moses became a god to pharaoh to the external people outside of the believers amen he says and he made you a god to the people who not to each other but a god to the people that are outside looking in your god to them amen that's right and you this morning are written epistles of god your lives are of god and even carry the holy ghost amen remember when that seventh seal opened it showed us christ from beginning to end in type and shadow and the thing is we say that was christ in a type that was christ in a portion is really what we're saying it's not that it wasn't christ it was christ in a portion in joseph christ in a portion in noah christ in a portion with abraham through bits and bits and bits so if we can see it in them why can't we see it in ourselves amen christ in us the hope of glory paul said amen that's what we're looking for and all he's saying is that makes you a god not the god but it makes you a god it's a portion of him and you and so you're a god to the people that are around you and guess what he says you are what priests and kings were intercessors guess what when somebody asks us to pray for them and we pray and they get healed what does that make us we got access to something they don't that makes us a god to them if we can put it that way because we have power we have authority we have access to something that they don't they could write movies about that kind of thing the things that happened in brother brown's ministry are the stuff of movies where they'd say it's science fiction it doesn't happen you know because now they do wizards and they you know they put their hands out and do this brother brown just speak the word and it would happen amen what was it he was god to the people and it's no different for you and i yeah smaller portion smaller gift but he says brother i'm saying here as jesus said you are god to the people that are looking on amen amen it's not just a five-fold ministry it's the entire church amen let's get him back try and finish this out amen for the perfection of the saints then for the working of the for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body amen so the the perfecting of the saints was the equipping of you and then the work of the ministry means that we are focused on the job i mean that our consuming passion our focus is to do the work of a minister that's what takes up the majority of our time that's what takes up the majority of the energy that's what we give ourselves to is to minister to the body of christ and then it says for what purpose for the edifying of the body of christ this is the nitty-gritty because if you look at a man and all that's happening is he's getting better and better and the body's not getting better we got a problem he says because the purpose of the five-fold ministry is to edify the entire body of christ that word edifying means the act of building and building up the act of one who promotes another person's growth in christian wisdom piety happiness and holiness over their own so it puts them in a position of servanthood not in a position of leadership amen really as we've said before leadership is an inverted pyramid where the guy that's supposedly at the top is really at the bottom amen and he's working to support everyone else that's above him amen so when you see a man that labors for you you can have confidence in that man because he's doing what god has told him to do the working of the ministry is for the edifying of the body which means you not just him amen amen says this it is only the love of our father that loves us so much that he sends his word sends his word he sends his ministers to preach the word amen so they're a carrier for the word they're bringing what he sends he sends his word and he uses a man to bring it then he sends gifts into the church with his arms spread out trying to get you to believe it stimulate your faith as we read earlier he wants to heal you tonight a thousand times more than you want to be healed but you're afraid you go by how you feel because you've regarded that you've lived by your feelings your whole life has been wrapped in that but you must get away from that and act on god's word not what you feel not what you see what god said and act on that make a confession confess means to say the same thing and he's at the right hand of the father with his own blood to make intercessions on your confession i think brother tim pruitt said it well when he says i serve you he says but i answer to god that's a fine balance sometimes because we're here for the benefit of the people but we don't answer to the people amen why because he says he sends his word and then he sends a man to preach it so he's sending the word and he's got a man that delivers it so we answer to god for what we preach we don't answer to the people and when the min when the when the lady come and they try and tell a preacher what to preach there's a problem because it's god that tells him not the people amen amen and what happens then if you get into a situation like that is that what happens you end up with a deacon board running a church you have a trustee board running the church and all of a sudden the pastor has no movement because what the holy spirit is being quenched by the leadership of men amen we don't have boards telling our pastor what to preach and then you can't do it or correcting him and then they can speak to him if he's off the word but you don't get to go in and say that really wasn't what we needed today brother no that's between him and god the answer is to god he's serving you but he answers directly to god brahm says now i want to say that i believe in leadership but it is not the leadership of men i believe in i believe in the leadership of the holy s ghost coming through the word he said he sent his word and then he sent a man to deliver the word he says i believe in the leadership of the holy ghost coming through the word so the word is our filter at all times amen i believe also that god has said men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order i believe that i believe also that the church is ruled over by men that god sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that it it is not men really ruling but the spirit of god for the word and the spirit are one we read that at the beginning remember one lord one father one spirit one faith one hope all these different things he says that's it's got to be the holy spirit working in them hebrews 13 7 says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation what you look at how that man's life has turned out or is turning out that'll tell you if he's got the truth in him amen if his life's a mess why would you trust him amen if the word hasn't had an effect in his life what do you think it's going to have if he brings it to you amen a man's family that's the reason why there's qualifications for pastors is because their family is their first proof of ministry and then after that it will be the church body amen amen so how long are we going to keep doing this how are you going to have to listen to brother gerald and me up here and any minister that comes in he says for the perfecting the saints right for how long till we come in the unity of the faith amen and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ we there yet he determines it we don't see sometimes exactly what we are we don't see how much god has moved in us we don't see how much he's grown in us but he's going to choose today he's going to say that's it you've come as far as i need you to go you've expressed what i need you to express but until that time the fivefold ministry will keep working amen my personal opinion is only that when those dead in christ rise and we have the 30 to 40 days of fellowship with them that's probably when we need to stop preaching it's done doors closed god's already hit the let's go home button and it's just a 30 to 40 day and then we're gone and we're just gonna sit around and fellowship we won't worry about bills we won't worry about anything we'll just be sitting around saying we're leaving soon we are definitely leaving soon isn't that right sister coffee yes brother we're leaving soon amen won't that be a wonderful thing amen but until then you've got to listen to brother gerald and myself amen what is the unity of the faith it's when your faith becomes sight amen and that is the rapture amen when you see those resurrection saints walking amongst us that's the unity of our faith that's what we're looking for brother brown says the only thing left it's going away of the church and then so you're going to have to listen to the five-fold ministry until we do that but with that with that rapture before that comes we'll have knowledge of the son of god that means you will know him in the fullness of the power of his resurrection and then you're going to know that he is god and that you are his child amen it's going to be in a way that we have never experienced it not even in the prophet's own ministry did he experience a rapture amen we're going to see something in our midst that will let us know that he is our god and we are his people amen amen glory under the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that means we're all going to be mature we're all going to be grown up we're all going to be doing the bit that we have to that doesn't mean we're all going to be some great wonderful christian i believe we're going to have 12 or 13 year olds that just got saved and got the holy ghost but guess what there's parts of your bodies that don't have to be this amazing thing they just have to be there right take a take the little the the smallest capillary in your body and pull it out and what happens that blood flow doesn't get to the spot it needs and it'll it'll cause gangrene eventually right get enough little parts missing all they're doing is carrying blood that's all they're doing carrying blood to the to the extremities of the body take them out and the body's not perfect and it'll start to die on itself in those little places all you need is something that can carry the word amen and it's what it's done its part right it's not a big bicep it's not huge chest muscles or you know a massive back or quads the size of trees it's just a little capillary that we need to get blood to that final spot to bring it to life and then god says we're good to go amen we'd all all have to have this massive ministry man but we do have to let the word flow through us amen by the power of the holy spirit what's the effect of this amen we're closing that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro so this is what children are children are tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive if you're dealing with any of these it means you're still a child in christ so he's saying amen we're going to mature under these ministries in other words the true fivefold ministry is going to take you from a child into a maturity in christ that cannot be achieved otherwise amen that means we're going to stop acting like children responding like children being petty like children being selfish like children we're going to start acting like real men and women in christ amen paul talked to the corinthians and i want you to catch what he says is the sign of childishness this is first corinthians 3 he says and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual that's a hard letter to read but as unto carnal even as unto babes and christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither now are you able he says i haven't been able to preach the good stuff and i still can't that's not the words you want to hear from a prophet amen what is it paul's ready to teach the deeper things paul has all the deeper things that they could ever need but he says i can't do it he says for ye are yet colonel for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not colonel and walker's men now these are people that you know supposedly held all things in common went from house to house fellowshipping and whatnot you say how does this kind of stuff get in next verse tells us it says for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal what was it people attaching themselves to men's ministries that's a sign of spiritual childishness now we don't have a whole lot of choice here i don't think we have that problem amen but just to put it out there so that we don't get into a situation like that people listening online these different things what is it people were identifying themselves with a brother's ministry rather than with christ right and listen paul's name's in there paul says some of you are saying you are of me why because you matured under my ministry you came to the lord under my ministry so you now say i'm of brother paul's church and then other ones are saying i'm of brother apollo's church he says no no you can't do that that's the way children think right what is it suddenly they weren't christians but they were i go to brother paul's church that's what we're getting into in the message quite frankly many times i go to brother so-and-so's church good are you a christian i don't know but i go to brother so-and-so's church and he's a wonderful man with a wonderful ministry and wonderful gifts no no no no so would you ever go to brother so-and-so's no no my pastor doesn't approve of him right that's what that's what happened was there were divisions based on ministry right and paul says here he says so who then is paul he says who am i who then is apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man he says look there's just men that you believe the word came to them they came to you it was god that sent them why are you attached to them right listen paul wasn't going around asking people to attach to him but his name was still being passed around as people being attached to his ministry so it's not always the men's fault sometimes it is sometimes the men put the divisions in there but people like to attach to flesh and blood rather than the supernatural amen and so they do it through the supernatural gifts rather than to the one that's operating those gifts in the first place amen listen if you can find a believer a a minister that you can rely on that you can trust on that you can accept his words you found a good thing it's god's grace to you that you've found one and it's god's grace to him that you can receive him amen because not every minister is for every person amen the pastors don't own the people they're god's people so if you can't be fed where you are get yourself to one where you can it's that simple we've turned it into this big thing of well i've got to stay here for 20 30. no no if you genuinely can't be fed where you are you need to go someplace else just make sure it's not you that's the problem instead of the pet instead of the pastor or the ministry team there amen because what you get otherwise is church hoppers right and as one brother said he says the church you're going to is perfect until you get there right because you're going to go there and you're going to find the imperfections even if you yourself are perfect it's going to turn imperfect because what you've got an imperfect spirit on you that's critical of whoever comes into that church and preaches behind that pulpit because you actually think you know more than they do usually right more spiritual these different things amen paul says look they're just men they're just men that god's using if god used one in particular for you praise the lord but it's god that sent him he didn't do anything in and of himself amen he says i planted apollos watered but god gave the increase you are where you are not because of me or not because of apollos but it's god that gave the increase amen amen now he that planteth sorry so then neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth he says we're nothing we're nothing no big shots no great ones amongst us as brother rams said but god that giveth the increase amen thank you jesus but he that planteth and he that watereth our one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor amen like i said before we're all accountable to god for what we preach behind this pulpit amen for we are laborers together with god amen again we're the ones working but ye are god's husbandry and year god's building it's his and his alone to work with you to claim what any sort of benefit to claim any sort of praise any sort of honor any sort of credit doesn't go to the ministry he says ye are god's husbandry and ye are god's building amen amen we don't want to get stuck on brother so and so was preaching for us brother so-and-so is and and we start ignoring what's right in front of us amen you need to be able to feed on what you have in front of you or you need to get someplace where you can amen now we still need to have the five-fold ministry he didn't ordain a five-fold ministry so we could have a one or a two-fold either that's the flip side right because what it is is remember they come in to stimulate your faith and guess what one brother may stem your fa stimulate your faith different than brother gerald does and i stimulate it different and another brother comes in and he's got a gift of this and that what is it is to help boost the body and then sometimes we have a need of that quick injection or an evangelist to come in and kind of think clean things up a bit guess what when you get divisions in the church and people are tied in and there's personal connections you need somebody to come in that knows nothing about it and he preaches the word and he hammers it out and then you either line up or you get out right we need that in there sometimes to just kind of what flush the local church out to deal with a couple situations and guess what brother gerald needs feeding i need feeding as well that five full ministry brings in what word for the pastor word for the minister that gets behind the pulpit it's nice to receive not always give you know and those sorts of things so they're there for that purpose but if you're here god has supplied the ministry that you need on a daily basis and then it's up to him to bring in the extras that we need from time to time as well amen amen so as we close ephesians 4 15. so this is when we stop being children this is what it looks like it says but speaking the truth in love we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ amen god bless you if i'll just invite the musicians to come up amen god's love is the requirement here that he's talking about that we grow up into what all things in love we grow up into all things that he has called us to be amen amen amen for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love that is the most difficult line in scripture to read and it makes almost no sense until you break it down bit by bit but what he's saying is the body has what it needs to supply its own needs god adds him what's needed if it's missing he brings it in it's not needed it takes it out amen and everything is working there to what help everyone in that in that body grow to mature to tie us together to get us to the place where we're all exactly where god wants us to be according to his word according to the image that he had before the foundation of the world amen let's just stand us up together i mean lord willing after this we'll see where it goes i'm not sure maybe we will go into the the gifts in the local body in these things but still praying about i don't have direction on that yet but i'm headed out on vacation shortly of course i think brother gerald's got wednesday night but uh just trusting god will be here and moving the services amen let's bow our
