[49:36] so he can bring out the attitude and the
[49:37] spirit of the believers
[49:39] are they going to hunger and thirst for
[49:41] fellowship amen
[49:43] are they going to hunger and thirst oh
[49:45] for the lord to to move this away so
[49:47] that we can we can get together again
[49:49] amen welcome maybe this is why that the
[49:51] anointing was on on
[49:52] the apostle paul amen the messenger of
[49:55] that first age
[49:57] you know when he encouraged the
[49:59] believers in that age
[50:01] he said forsake not the assembly of
[50:02] yourselves together
[50:04] and much more as you see that day
[50:07] approaching
[50:07] amen the end so brother i believe that
[50:11] really applies to us
[50:13] much more amen because the world is out
[50:16] there
[50:16] under the control of the devil is taking
[50:18] control of all things
[50:20] amen and he's in control of us in that
[50:22] sense
[50:23] amen beware we and you're just making a
[50:25] law and so we got to abide by that law
[50:28] amen and we can't get together like this
[50:31] and as i was i might have mentioned it
[50:34] briefly
[50:35] but it's was shortly just after all this
[50:38] struck
[50:40] with us here i saw it somewhere maybe on
[50:43] the internet it was a picture
[50:45] of a of a believer somewhere in another
[50:47] country
[50:48] and of course what we're experiencing
[50:50] now they experience
[50:52] constantly in that country they live in
[50:54] because you know religion is not allowed
[50:56] and churches is not allowed and all that
[50:59] amen
[51:00] and the brother was saying oh my he said
[51:03] we're out and we're here in the
[51:05] wilderness they said but we
[51:06] we got no umbrellas amen
[51:09] and why would he need a umbrella because
[51:12] it was it was raining
[51:14] so i pray the grace of god you know that
[51:16] we'll really have that hunger and thirst
[51:17] for fellowship
[51:19] whether it's here a few of us two or
[51:21] three at a time or whatever or whether
[51:23] it's like them
[51:24] out there in the wilderness in rain amen
[51:27] so i pray i don't know what country they
[51:29] are in but i pray the grace of god
[51:30] so lord help us that we're not going to
[51:33] take this for granted
[51:34] but lord we're going to allow it to help
[51:36] us to identify with brothers and sisters
[51:38] around the world
[51:39] they are not allowed not allowed to
[51:41] gather in church like this
[51:43] not allowed to gather for fellowship
[51:44] around the word like we
[51:46] are so i thank god for it amen was only
[51:49] two or three allah or five rather
[51:51] allowed in the building here
[51:52] and praying the grace of god that the
[51:54] others amen are still
[51:56] in in in contact by the by the mass by
[51:59] the
[51:59] technology again we wonder why god
[52:02] allowed this why god allowed that
[52:04] the invention of those things amen well
[52:07] he allowed it for a reason
[52:08] amen the others are going to go that way
[52:10] but believers are going to go this way
[52:12] amen so we're appreciating
[52:16] day of the invention amen i'm
[52:18] appreciating what god has done
[52:20] amen though the world out there brother
[52:22] and sister they're they're not exactly
[52:24] into anything spiritual
[52:25] but the true seed of god is amen
[52:28] so we thank the lord for that and again
[52:31] pray the grace of god be with us here
[52:33] and the grace of god be with the saints
[52:35] at home again we're claiming the promise
[52:38] where two
[52:38] or three are gathered in my name there
[52:41] am i in the midst
[52:42] amen and trusting again as i
[52:45] have highlighted that it is
[52:48] it is not us that's gathered but he
[52:50] gathered us
[52:52] where i have gathered two or three
[52:54] together is in my name there am i in the
[52:56] midst
[52:56] amen well if if god didn't gather them
[52:59] he's not there
[53:00] yeah so we pray the grace of god be with
[53:03] us
[53:04] and the saints who are at home or
[53:05] wherever they may be god yes
[53:08] as i've said also that we i've been
[53:10] informed just recently
[53:11] that brethren brothers and sisters
[53:15] different parts of the world have been
[53:16] tuning in
[53:18] on the internet and and listening to the
[53:21] service
[53:22] so i we pray god bless them amen because
[53:25] there are places in different parts of
[53:27] the world they may not
[53:28] have a you know the internet they may
[53:31] not have it themselves the computers
[53:33] and all that but there there are
[53:36] buildings that they can go to
[53:37] a man and they're allowed to go in and
[53:39] sit down and
[53:41] and and use a computer and they and many
[53:43] of them they're those yes number of
[53:45] years they've been doing this
[53:46] some of them they're going to those
[53:48] places and man
[53:50] and maybe they got you know they have to
[53:52] pay something for it
[53:53] but they're going there and they'll go
[53:55] in and sit down and listen to our
[53:56] services
[53:57] amen so god bless them wherever they are
[54:00] whatever part of the world they're in
[54:02] amen now god help us to appreciate
[54:05] amen what we're doing and it's not just
[54:08] for us here
[54:09] it's for those around the world thank
[54:11] god amen
[54:13] so that i pray grace that we don't feel
[54:17] at home
[54:18] in this world anymore as you were
[54:21] singing tonight
[54:22] amen sing the truth by the grace of god
[54:25] amen lord bless us turn with me to
[54:28] romans chapter 5.
[54:32] and tonight i want to share with you
[54:33] some thoughts that brother branham
[54:36] brought to our attention and he preached
[54:39] it in uh
[54:40] in his own church in jeffersonville
[54:43] phantom tabernacle
[54:45] and it's amazing that uh
[54:50] the message is almost it's almost two
[54:52] hours to listen to on a tape
[54:54] but the thing of it is that brother
[54:56] brown never got into preaching
[54:58] oh maybe this message is 30 something or
[55:01] 35
[55:02] pages and brother brown never got into
[55:04] preaching
[55:06] the message until we reach around i
[55:08] think it's page
[55:10] 13 or 14 something like that when he's
[55:12] or 17
[55:14] 17. it's pay 17 that's when he read the
[55:17] scriptures
[55:18] so he said i'm going to preach for a few
[55:19] minutes amen
[55:21] so we know brother brown's few minutes
[55:23] is not exactly according to our time
[55:25] schedule
[55:26] amen so he went it went a little longer
[55:29] amen because the message herself is
[55:30] almost
[55:30] two hours amen but i'm just going to
[55:33] share with you some of the thoughts that
[55:34] he has expressed
[55:36] and some scriptures concerning the
[55:39] subject
[55:40] that he was preaching on and the subject
[55:43] that he was ministering on
[55:44] is ashamed ashamed
[55:48] we're ashamed of this ashamed of that
[55:50] but i pray grace we're not ashamed of
[55:52] him
[55:53] amen that we're not ashamed of the
[55:54] gospel amen we're not ashamed
[55:57] of the message and there's also to
[55:59] highlight that
[56:00] within the last few days there was a
[56:02] number of things that
[56:04] i came in contact with that were totally
[56:07] completely
[56:08] anti-message amen anti
[56:12] william branham oh yes and there's one
[56:15] gentleman in
[56:16] i want to mention his name but i have
[56:18] been in contact with them
[56:20] when they who were part of the message
[56:22] left the message
[56:24] and because they didn't they didn't
[56:25] believe this they didn't believe that so
[56:26] they walked away from the message
[56:28] and uh and we uh brother joseph would
[56:31] know who they are
[56:32] and because uh they're i'm one of the
[56:35] ones at the accused
[56:37] of you know saying this and doing this
[56:39] and preaching this
[56:40] to cover they said cover up brother
[56:42] branagh's mistakes
[56:44] brother we don't need to cover up ears
[56:45] we need to cover our powers
[56:47] amen our mistakes but again i did
[56:51] my last thoughts with the brother and uh
[56:55] he did say all right he said brother he
[56:57] said i'll just
[56:58] move on he said we'll leave it at that
[57:02] because i was challenging him to do this
[57:04] to do that amen and so he got to the
[57:06] place where he would just
[57:07] end the conversation and we'll leave it
[57:09] at that and so this brother is
[57:11] is there talking for a one and a half
[57:14] hours
[57:15] amen and what's he doing he's trying to
[57:17] bring out mistakes he's trying to bring
[57:19] out this
[57:19] brother brown did this what was it
[57:21] wasn't right he did that wasn't right
[57:23] that wasn't right
[57:24] and maybe he was preaching certain
[57:25] things and he highlighted certain things
[57:27] and he said that wasn't right and oh
[57:29] yeah and he said oh yeah he said this
[57:31] there
[57:31] and then the difference in a different
[57:33] thing he said right here
[57:35] and i said lord i said we pray grace for
[57:37] that man he's gonna need grace
[57:39] for salvation for sure he's taken his
[57:41] stand against the prophet
[57:43] amen he's taken his stand against the
[57:45] message
[57:46] and again i won't say where it is but
[57:50] i have i have come across many many
[57:52] things that are
[57:53] negative against the message negative
[57:57] against william branham so brother i i
[58:00] well i'll tell you this as
[58:03] it was in the prophets in their day and
[58:05] age in the old testament
[58:07] as it was with jesus when he the word
[58:09] was made flesh
[58:11] amen he had to deal with the negatives
[58:14] and and oh he was accused of this
[58:15] accused of that he was condemned for
[58:17] this and condemned for that until they
[58:18] crucified him that's right
[58:20] so brother but what was it it was the
[58:22] truth it was the word
[58:24] in flesh amen but brother again
[58:28] they didn't they didn't see it they'd
[58:29] have read eyes to see they didn't have
[58:31] an ear to hear the word of god
[58:33] god help us and god thank us for that oh
[58:36] yeah that we got eyes to see
[58:38] and we have ears to hear the word by the
[58:40] grace of god amen
[58:41] this grace because you young people are
[58:43] here i call you young
[58:45] even though you're maybe in your 30s
[58:47] late 30s whatever and
[58:48] getting close to 40 amen but it's the
[58:51] grace of god that you're believing the
[58:52] word
[58:53] amen the grace of god that you're
[58:55] staying with the word
[58:57] the grace of god you're hunging and
[58:58] thirsting amen for the word
[59:00] and that you're amen and what god has
[59:02] ordained he's
[59:04] bringing to pass in your life to what
[59:06] poor to hunger thirst for the
[59:07] resurrection
[59:08] and the rapture amen because what god
[59:11] has done
[59:12] in the message of a prophet is to give
[59:14] us the revelation
[59:15] of who we are and where we are and to
[59:17] give alicia
[59:18] give us a revelation of time and what's
[59:21] left
[59:22] amen what is god moving on now
[59:26] not pentecost amen not luther not wesley
[59:29] amen not many others out there that god
[59:32] used
[59:32] no no now now god's getting us to look
[59:35] for the resurrection
[59:36] and the rapture amen it's tremendous
[59:39] when the prophet of god said he said god
[59:42] is waiting on you
[59:43] amen he was waiting on luther he's
[59:45] waiting on wesley amen god did this god
[59:47] did that
[59:48] and there was a time when when they
[59:50] caught the revelation for their day
[59:52] amen and god anointed them with a great
[59:54] anointing and they went forth living it
[59:56] amen and preaching it and now brother
[59:58] and sister are we living it
[1:00:00] and are we preaching it concerning what
[1:00:02] god has done today
[1:00:04] oh yeah we can get into the into the
[1:00:05] doctrine but that's that's fine
[1:00:08] amen but god really wants us to be
[1:00:11] sure on and living our lives for
[1:00:14] is is the resurrection and the rapture
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:18] that we're going forth as witnesses and
[1:00:20] by pray grace that we're not ashamed
[1:00:23] amen he's preaching on this subject
[1:00:25] ashamed amen
[1:00:26] we're not ashamed to take our stand for
[1:00:29] the word
[1:00:29] we're not ashamed to take our stand for
[1:00:31] what we believe god did
[1:00:33] and why god did it it's one thing again
[1:00:36] understand this
[1:00:37] to you to us here and then the saints
[1:00:39] online understand
[1:00:41] it's not just recognizing and saying oh
[1:00:42] yeah this is what god did this is what
[1:00:44] god did i believe it i believe it
[1:00:46] no it's good but let's believe what he's
[1:00:48] doing amen but i tell you there's a lot
[1:00:50] of so-called believers
[1:00:52] that don't believe what god's doing and
[1:00:55] they're really not into what god is
[1:00:56] doing
[1:00:57] brother actually they're focusing on
[1:00:59] what he's done when they come
[1:01:00] when it comes to doctrine but they're
[1:01:02] not focusing on what why god did it
[1:01:04] amen and why did god do it he did it to
[1:01:07] give us a certain faith
[1:01:09] amen so that there's going to be
[1:01:11] somebody here believing this
[1:01:13] somebody here looking for this looking
[1:01:14] for that the resurrection and the
[1:01:16] rapture again
[1:01:17] god help us amen sir brother and again
[1:01:21] i believe god's going to would allow it
[1:01:23] to go on to the generation that's here
[1:01:25] and he said the third or the fourth
[1:01:27] generation usually he says that's the
[1:01:28] ones that go to the denomination
[1:01:30] but why because the greater number less
[1:01:33] past that believes it
[1:01:34] the greater number that knows what god
[1:01:36] is doing and why brother
[1:01:38] because they're going to go on amen and
[1:01:40] there's going to be another generation
[1:01:42] brother i tell you if if we're going on
[1:01:45] and our brother paul is still here and
[1:01:47] brother matthew and brother
[1:01:49] brother yes brother he's still here
[1:01:52] you're all still here
[1:01:53] and and the brothers and sisters i pray
[1:01:56] god
[1:01:57] you will be here amen brother and not
[1:02:00] just
[1:02:00] oh yeah not just uh saying i believe the
[1:02:03] message
[1:02:03] but no you're going to believe what god
[1:02:06] is wanting you to believe
[1:02:07] amen because if the older generation
[1:02:09] goes off the scene
[1:02:10] god wants somebody here by the grace of
[1:02:13] god that's believing it
[1:02:14] amen you're going going away from the
[1:02:17] doctrine
[1:02:18] into the revelation of the resurrection
[1:02:21] into the revelation
[1:02:22] of the rapture amen so i pray grace
[1:02:25] grace grace
[1:02:26] and again god forgive i pray those
[1:02:28] brothers out there that are
[1:02:30] online and and condemning william
[1:02:32] branham condemning this just teaching
[1:02:34] that teaching oh yeah it's amazing
[1:02:36] absolutely amazing for a person to go
[1:02:39] online for an hour and a half
[1:02:41] and just talk negative negative negative
[1:02:43] against
[1:02:44] the prophet and against the message
[1:02:47] god help us amen so let's go into romans
[1:02:51] chapter 5
[1:02:54] and begin reading the first five verses
[1:02:57] amen
[1:03:01] therefore being justified by faith
[1:03:05] we have peace with god amen
[1:03:11] he said through our lord jesus christ
[1:03:15] amen thank god for jesus by whom also we
[1:03:18] have
[1:03:19] access by faith
[1:03:22] into this grace wherein we stand
[1:03:26] amen and rejoice in hope
[1:03:30] of the glory of god and not only so
[1:03:34] but with glory in tribulations also
[1:03:38] knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:03:40] patience
[1:03:41] and patience experience
[1:03:45] and experience hope
[1:03:48] amen and hope maketh not ashamed
[1:03:52] because the love of god is shed abroad
[1:03:55] in our hearts
[1:03:56] by the holy ghost
[1:03:59] which is given unto us amen
[1:04:04] hope that maketh not ashamed because
[1:04:07] the love of god is shed abroad in our
[1:04:09] hearts
[1:04:10] by the holy ghost which is given unto us
[1:04:13] amen the lord bless you may be seated
[1:04:16] and turn with me
[1:04:19] to second second timothy chapter one
[1:04:24] amen second timothy chapter 1
[1:04:32] and verse 6
[1:04:37] wherefore i put thee in remembrance
[1:04:40] that thou stir up the gift of god which
[1:04:43] is in thee
[1:04:45] by the putting off of my hands
[1:04:49] for god has not given us the spirit of
[1:04:51] fear
[1:04:52] but of power and of love
[1:04:56] and of a sound mind amen
[1:05:00] for not though be not therefore ashamed
[1:05:04] of the testimony of our lord
[1:05:08] nor of me is prisoner
[1:05:11] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[1:05:14] of the gospel
[1:05:15] according to the power of god
[1:05:18] who has saved us and called us with an
[1:05:21] holy calling not according to our works
[1:05:25] but according to his own purpose amen
[1:05:29] and grace which was given us in christ
[1:05:32] jesus
[1:05:33] before the world began
[1:05:37] amen praise the lord just think
[1:05:41] that we're in the mind of god before the
[1:05:42] world began amen
[1:05:44] and god god was doing what he wanted he
[1:05:46] would want to want to do in these
[1:05:49] in this day this age he was doing it
[1:05:51] then he put it in your heart then he put
[1:05:52] in your soul then
[1:05:54] amen by the grace of god hallelujah
[1:05:58] see again verse 9 who has saved us and
[1:06:01] called us with an holy calling
[1:06:03] not according to our works no but
[1:06:06] according to his own purpose
[1:06:07] and grace which was given us in christ
[1:06:11] jesus
[1:06:12] before the world began but is now
[1:06:15] made manifest by the appearing of our
[1:06:17] savior
[1:06:18] jesus christ who hath abolished
[1:06:21] death amen god eldest to believe
[1:06:25] and has brought life and immortality to
[1:06:27] light
[1:06:28] through the gospel whereunto
[1:06:32] i am appointed a preacher and an apostle
[1:06:36] and a teacher of the gentiles
[1:06:40] for the which cause i also suffer these
[1:06:43] things
[1:06:44] nevertheless i am not ashamed
[1:06:47] for i know whom i have believed
[1:06:51] amen i am not ashamed
[1:06:54] for i know whom i have believed
[1:06:57] and am persuaded that he is able to keep
[1:07:00] that which i
[1:07:01] have committed unto him against that day
[1:07:04] amen god bless his word amen
[1:07:08] and i'll share with you another
[1:07:10] scripture
[1:07:12] which the proud of god as i said he
[1:07:14] didn't get into the scripture to read it
[1:07:16] until page 17 and he was highlighting
[1:07:20] some other things
[1:07:21] to them before he really got in to
[1:07:24] preach a message
[1:07:26] and again at the same time he said he
[1:07:27] would only preach for
[1:07:29] five minutes and uh
[1:07:32] but it was uh i believe an hour or more
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:36] so his his time and his watch is not the
[1:07:38] same as ours i guess
[1:07:40] and maybe yours is not the same as mine
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:43] so but again that's that's amen it's
[1:07:46] we're not when it comes to time
[1:07:48] we're governed by a calendar we're
[1:07:49] governed by a clock amen
[1:07:51] but that doesn't interfere with the lord
[1:07:53] amen he's not into the calendars he's
[1:07:55] not into the clocks
[1:07:56] amen why because he's eternal amen
[1:08:00] and god through all down through the
[1:08:02] ages through the messages
[1:08:03] and the messengers that he has sent to
[1:08:05] minister to the seed of god and the sons
[1:08:07] and daughters of god
[1:08:08] amen is to put us in contact with
[1:08:11] eternity
[1:08:12] amen by the grace of god amen to give us
[1:08:15] an experience
[1:08:16] so that we're not ashamed of what god
[1:08:18] has done we're not ashamed of what god
[1:08:20] is doing
[1:08:21] amen and not ashamed of what he will do
[1:08:23] amen
[1:08:24] we're amen and that's why we are here
[1:08:27] tonight
[1:08:27] because we're not ashamed there are
[1:08:30] those that would be ashamed
[1:08:31] they would feel down why having to leave
[1:08:33] this church leave that church to
[1:08:35] go away but not not identify with that
[1:08:37] with the with these
[1:08:38] other ministries amen that's all right
[1:08:41] there's so there's ministries out there
[1:08:42] for the foolish virgin
[1:08:43] but there's ministries for the wise
[1:08:45] virgin amen
[1:08:47] so god has given us the wisdom to know
[1:08:49] that it
[1:08:50] it's with it's his wisdom amen so be
[1:08:53] be there when you take heed to what
[1:08:55] you're hearing amen by the grace of god
[1:08:57] amen because what we need to hear is
[1:09:00] what god wants us to hear in this hour
[1:09:02] what god wants us to hear in this age in
[1:09:04] this day amen
[1:09:06] so brother and again because we consider
[1:09:09] what william branham and who he was
[1:09:11] amen and what god did for him through
[1:09:14] him for us
[1:09:15] amen we consider those things but we
[1:09:18] want to be
[1:09:18] in the present tense what god is doing
[1:09:21] now through
[1:09:22] the message amen brother unfortunately
[1:09:25] back in luther's day and wesley's day
[1:09:27] and the other ages
[1:09:28] amen the people considered what god did
[1:09:31] through luther what god did so wesley
[1:09:33] but they went on and went on until they
[1:09:35] made a made a denomination out of it
[1:09:37] and as i said it was the the prophet
[1:09:39] said the third or fourth generation
[1:09:41] that rose on the scene of every message
[1:09:43] that god brought on the earth
[1:09:45] and and especially in the in the gentile
[1:09:47] ages
[1:09:48] and he said after the third or fourth
[1:09:50] generation he said they became a
[1:09:52] denomination
[1:09:53] amen and so what did god do god had to
[1:09:55] move on
[1:09:56] to another messenger he had to move out
[1:09:59] of of the organized religion of that day
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:02] amen because what god wanted to reveal
[1:10:05] to them that organized religion wouldn't
[1:10:07] allow
[1:10:08] amen they would they would fight it amen
[1:10:10] and brother
[1:10:11] again even in this hour in this age
[1:10:14] there are things that god's revealing to
[1:10:15] the bride
[1:10:16] making real to the bride concerning the
[1:10:18] message of the hour
[1:10:20] and we're moving on with the spiritual
[1:10:23] revelation of the word
[1:10:24] god did this right god and god is doing
[1:10:28] this
[1:10:28] amen because the first pull goes into
[1:10:31] the second and the second goes into the
[1:10:32] third
[1:10:33] amen god is blending one with the other
[1:10:36] until amen
[1:10:37] it comes to that place where we got the
[1:10:39] faith that pleases god
[1:10:41] amen don't just go back and say god did
[1:10:43] this i believe it i believe what he did
[1:10:45] what he did what he did
[1:10:46] and i uh uh oh yeah and oh i believe
[1:10:49] he's gonna do this but
[1:10:50] but to get us ready for what he's gonna
[1:10:52] do he's doing something now
[1:10:54] amen based on what he did he's doing
[1:10:58] amen based on what he did through
[1:11:00] william branham amen through the oatmeal
[1:11:02] of the word
[1:11:03] the mystery of god brother that's good
[1:11:05] we can look back and say yeah that's
[1:11:06] what he did that's what he did
[1:11:07] praise the lord thank you lord amen yeah
[1:11:10] but he wants you to get into what he did
[1:11:12] and he wants you to enter into it you
[1:11:14] become one with it
[1:11:16] amen and have understanding of what he
[1:11:18] did amen
[1:11:19] and you'll prove it by your faith amen
[1:11:21] not just faith in what he did
[1:11:23] but now that god is adding to that faith
[1:11:25] it gets bigger bigger
[1:11:27] greater greater faith got it now now
[1:11:29] we're into what god is doing
[1:11:31] amen and brother if you want to trace it
[1:11:34] back it'll go back to
[1:11:35] what god did in the ministry of a
[1:11:38] prophet
[1:11:38] what god did in the ministry of william
[1:11:41] branham amen in the opening of the seven
[1:11:43] seals
[1:11:43] by the grace of god and again the power
[1:11:46] of god as highlighted
[1:11:47] a number of times after the opening of
[1:11:49] the sails he said why does god do it did
[1:11:51] all this
[1:11:52] he said it's to give us rapturing faith
[1:11:55] amen why did god do what he did to
[1:11:57] luther to give them
[1:11:59] get the faith for justification amen
[1:12:02] oh yeah brother when it struck them they
[1:12:05] read scripture read scripture read it
[1:12:06] before and over and over again
[1:12:08] but still they were looking oh i got to
[1:12:10] do this to be justified i got to do that
[1:12:12] to be justified you don't have to do it
[1:12:14] it's done amen same with sanctification
[1:12:18] don't have to do it it's done
[1:12:19] amen and god had to bring those
[1:12:21] messengers on the scene
[1:12:22] that would catch the revelation of
[1:12:25] justification
[1:12:26] catch the revelation of sanctification
[1:12:29] amen the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:31] and the gifts of the spirit amen oh
[1:12:34] brother what was it it was god coming
[1:12:35] down
[1:12:36] god coming down and becoming more and
[1:12:38] more one
[1:12:39] with his seed his sons and daughters
[1:12:42] amen and and they were getting a greater
[1:12:44] and a greater and a greater faith
[1:12:46] amen and even there's there's many in
[1:12:48] the early generation of the pentecostals
[1:12:50] oh yeah they believed that the
[1:12:52] pentecostal message was going to take us
[1:12:54] on to the resurrection the rapture
[1:12:56] yeah but god was going to send a
[1:12:57] messenger with it amen
[1:13:00] to to go go beyond it as he said this
[1:13:02] message he said it
[1:13:03] is the climax of the pentecostal message
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:07] he said that in 1965 and he realized
[1:13:11] he knew it amen and there are other
[1:13:12] believers that knew god did that
[1:13:15] in pentecost but now they knew that god
[1:13:18] was moving on
[1:13:19] not not leaving it wasn't brother we
[1:13:21] don't leave luther beyond we don't leave
[1:13:23] wesley behind
[1:13:24] we don't leave the pentecostals behind
[1:13:26] and and what they were preaching and
[1:13:27] teaching amen
[1:13:29] amen and the revival they're
[1:13:31] experiencing amen
[1:13:32] it was moving on to a greater and a
[1:13:34] greater and a greater revival
[1:13:35] until we will get the faith amen it's
[1:13:38] not just going on and say well i'm
[1:13:40] following the message
[1:13:40] messenger of the hour and believing the
[1:13:42] message of the hour
[1:13:44] yeah if you are amen what are you going
[1:13:46] to do the others kept going on
[1:13:48] go on go on but now we're looking up
[1:13:51] amen now it's not going on so now uh oh
[1:13:55] is there any other preacher
[1:13:56] is he in any other messenger oh surely
[1:13:58] god's going to send us another message
[1:14:00] another message nothing whether it comes
[1:14:02] to a place where you're going to hear
[1:14:03] the last message
[1:14:04] amen praise the name of the lord and
[1:14:08] not not and oh my if you've got the
[1:14:10] revelation of it you know
[1:14:11] it is the last message if you got the
[1:14:13] revelation of it you know

[1:14:18] what god is looking for now
[1:14:19] resurrection rapture amen resurrection
[1:14:23] and rapturing faith
[1:14:24] but i i don't feel much of that faith
[1:14:27] being manifested
[1:14:28] i don't feel much of that faith being
[1:14:30] expressed
[1:14:31] amen brothers all grace to us
[1:14:34] as god brought israel out of egypt
[1:14:37] brother
[1:14:38] and he did this he did this he did that
[1:14:40] but now he sent them a messenger that
[1:14:42] was really going to bring them out
[1:14:44] amen or they could have this one i have
[1:14:46] that one no
[1:14:47] no way because any messenger any
[1:14:50] any any person rose up that might want
[1:14:53] to do this and might want to do that
[1:14:55] no they got against it but then god let
[1:14:58] them go on
[1:14:59] amen but then he sent the prophet
[1:15:02] amen with the revelation of the mystery
[1:15:04] of god concerning
[1:15:05] israel and you know when he said it
[1:15:07] because amen they
[1:15:09] right because god said i've heard the
[1:15:11] cries of my people
[1:15:12] i've come down to deliver them amen so
[1:15:14] there was there were those
[1:15:17] in israel the jews in egypt rather
[1:15:20] there were those there in egypt amen
[1:15:22] that were beginning to hunger and thirst
[1:15:24] for deliverance amen the oil
[1:15:28] because why because they knew by the
[1:15:30] word that god promised deliverance
[1:15:33] amen and we know by the word that god
[1:15:36] has promised
[1:15:37] a resurrection and a rapture amen
[1:15:40] he said we shall not all sleep good
[1:15:43] praise the lord amen but we shall all be
[1:15:46] changed
[1:15:47] amen the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:15:49] and we which our line remains shall be
[1:15:51] cut
[1:15:52] up together with them to meet the lord
[1:15:55] in the air god help us brother amen
[1:15:58] that i pray grace we're going to catch
[1:16:00] the revelation
[1:16:01] of the saints uh coming back to appear
[1:16:04] to us
[1:16:05] and the pro the power of god said they
[1:16:06] will appear to us and we'll and we'll
[1:16:08] see them
[1:16:09] and we'll we'll well amen brother in
[1:16:11] that hour we'll have that faith
[1:16:14] amen not emotion not sensation
[1:16:17] it's going to be faith amen god in
[1:16:20] simplicity
[1:16:21] it's faith it's something that god
[1:16:23] reveals and and
[1:16:24] and and the believer believes it amen
[1:16:27] others feel that god's got to do this
[1:16:29] god has got to do that you got to do
[1:16:30] this
[1:16:31] and then i'll believe i'll see this and
[1:16:33] i'll hear this and oh yeah i believe
[1:16:35] well brother god's going to do not what
[1:16:37] you think he got to do
[1:16:39] whatever god is going to do is in the
[1:16:41] word
[1:16:42] amen praise the name of the lord i tell
[1:16:45] you this
[1:16:47] it wasn't so much in luther or wesley or
[1:16:49] even the
[1:16:50] other other denominations that
[1:16:51] experienced revival back in those ages
[1:16:53] amen
[1:16:54] but and the pentecostals but the closer
[1:16:57] we got
[1:16:58] to the end the more more people were
[1:17:00] considering the resurrection
[1:17:02] considering the rapture oh we're getting
[1:17:04] close to the end now
[1:17:05] and they weren't focusing on that in
[1:17:06] luther's day in wesley's day in the
[1:17:08] old-fashioned salvation army day
[1:17:10] amen they just thought it was all up the
[1:17:12] road but not recognizing failing to
[1:17:15] nice amen what god was doing
[1:17:18] was leading to it amen and oh yeah we're
[1:17:21] getting close yeah look look look
[1:17:23] look what god has done now look what
[1:17:24] he's doing we must be getting closer to
[1:17:26] the resurrection
[1:17:27] we might be getting closer to rapture we
[1:17:29] ain't getting closer to go home to be
[1:17:31] with the lord
[1:17:32] amen and there was a generation of
[1:17:34] pentecostals
[1:17:35] an older generation brother they
[1:17:37] believed that
[1:17:39] oh they they believe what god did in the
[1:17:42] baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of
[1:17:43] the spirit
[1:17:44] amen but it was causing them with a
[1:17:47] greater faith to look on for the
[1:17:48] resurrection
[1:17:49] then where's the end oh lord we thank
[1:17:52] you for the resurrect
[1:17:53] we thank you for the for the pentecostal
[1:17:56] preach preaching and ministry
[1:17:58] of the gifts of the spirit the baptism

[1:18:04] double portion and move us on
[1:18:06] to the resurrection amen so god had to
[1:18:09] give it give us a double
[1:18:11] a different yet a double portion amen
[1:18:14] of the anointing of the holy ghost but
[1:18:17] with
[1:18:17] every anointing of the spirit comes the
[1:18:19] revelation of the word
[1:18:21] amen there was it was the holy ghost
[1:18:23] that came to luther
[1:18:25] amen and struck luther and when he
[1:18:26] struck him he looked into the bible oh
[1:18:29] that's it oh praise the lord amen
[1:18:31] jesus justified me amen luther oh
[1:18:34] jesus sanctified us praise the lord amen
[1:18:37] and then on to the pentecostals was
[1:18:39] getting greater and greater
[1:18:41] and the more one with the lord more one
[1:18:44] with the word
[1:18:45] amen and god or they begin to realize oh
[1:18:47] yeah
[1:18:48] oh they didn't well they didn't really
[1:18:50] realize what god
[1:18:52] was doing amen in the prophets
[1:18:55] god was coming in flesh amen
[1:18:59] he was revealing himself more and more
[1:19:01] and more in flesh

[1:19:36] and a thirst
[1:19:37] for more of the holy ghost more of the

[1:19:48] sanctification they got the revelation
[1:19:50] of the

[1:19:54] and and they were hungry and thirsting
[1:19:55] for more amen jose why

[1:20:02] on the road where god was moving amen

[1:22:42] amen don't be ashamed of the life that
[1:22:44] god is reflecting in you
[1:22:47] don't be ashamed of the life that god is
[1:22:49] is manifesting in us
[1:22:51] brother he manifested it in luther oh
[1:22:53] yeah
[1:22:54] and again and luther just preached it
[1:22:56] preached it preached it
[1:22:57] and in wesley as i said wesley preached
[1:22:59] five times a day
[1:23:01] amen and you know what five times
[1:23:05] on a sunday and a wednesday no
[1:23:08] five times a day and yeah and there were
[1:23:10] other times that wesley
[1:23:12] oh he gathered at a church and and there
[1:23:14] was two
[1:23:15] the crowd was too big to go into that
[1:23:17] church there was just too many people
[1:23:20] and so we'll see wesley would go walk
[1:23:22] walk
[1:23:23] from the church and into the cemetery
[1:23:25] because back in those days there was a
[1:23:27] church
[1:23:27] and a cemetery was next to the church
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:30] and when wesley went went over to the
[1:23:32] cemetery and he found the the biggest
[1:23:35] stone there
[1:23:35] and he got up on the tombstone amen amen
[1:23:39] the headstone we call it amen
[1:23:40] and he started to preach amen oh yeah in
[1:23:44] a cemetery
[1:23:44] amen proving that the power of the
[1:23:46] resurrection was in
[1:23:48] within luther within wesley amen and he
[1:23:51] began to preach and preach and preach
[1:23:54] by the grace of almighty god amen and he
[1:23:56] wasn't putting the emphasis on the
[1:23:57] natural things of life he put the
[1:23:59] emphasis on the spiritual
[1:24:01] amen and that's why like i said the
[1:24:03] governments went and
[1:24:04] invested in and checked them out why
[1:24:07] because albany when he says
[1:24:09] when he filed his papers at the end of
[1:24:11] the year with the government and for the
[1:24:12] government
[1:24:13] and they saw oh my uh he's making a lot
[1:24:16] of money
[1:24:17] you know and what's he doing with it and
[1:24:19] so on and he wasn't he wasn't
[1:24:21] i don't know if he was paying much taxes
[1:24:22] or not but like he said and so they came
[1:24:25] and they were they were shocked even in
[1:24:28] the house he lived in
[1:24:30] amen sure why because
[1:24:33] he only had one of this and one of that
[1:24:36] and one of this one of that
[1:24:37] they said come on look all the money you
[1:24:39] got you can have all of this you can
[1:24:41] have this
[1:24:42] he said i don't need it i don't need it
[1:24:44] he said no and i used the money for the
[1:24:46] just for the gospel
[1:24:47] and and again that's why i don't have i
[1:24:49] don't have and he said well what do you
[1:24:51] got well when luther
[1:24:52] when martin now martin luther when john
[1:24:53] wesley died brother all he had was a few
[1:24:55] pennies and he spoke it
[1:24:58] that's all he had that's all he had
[1:25:01] they went around searching wondering
[1:25:02] where's his money to because he had all
[1:25:04] he gave it out to the ministry here give
[1:25:06] it out to the ministry there give it out
[1:25:07] here give it out there
[1:25:09] amen and they say this is all he got
[1:25:12] they said that's all he got
[1:25:14] amen they're amazed not many are going
[1:25:17] to do it
[1:25:18] god help us brother concerning
[1:25:20] concerning you know
[1:25:21] these things oh my that we're not going
[1:25:24] to put the emphasis on the natural
[1:25:26] things of life
[1:25:27] but the spiritual and if god wants to
[1:25:29] bless us with more and more of the
[1:25:30] natural things but that's fine
[1:25:32] we'll let god do that and we'll give god
[1:25:34] the glory
[1:25:35] amen but we're not going to hunger and
[1:25:37] thirst for it
[1:25:38] amen no no lord your will not mine
[1:25:43] amen so the grace of god be with us and
[1:25:46] brother
[1:25:46] amen if god was looking for that anger
[1:25:49] and that thirst and that
[1:25:50] and that for for justification
[1:25:52] sanctification
[1:25:53] the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts
[1:25:55] of the spirit notice that hunger and
[1:25:57] thirst increased
[1:25:58] with every age amen and not just
[1:26:01] increase
[1:26:02] but it involved more and more of the
[1:26:05] world
[1:26:05] amen because until pentecost it went
[1:26:08] around the world
[1:26:09] amen and they were shocked that the
[1:26:12] pentecostal revival
[1:26:13] had such an influence around the world
[1:26:16] yeah they said what what's going on the
[1:26:19] pentecost was here pentecost was there
[1:26:21] pentagon somewhere else
[1:26:22] the people were worshiping god praising
[1:26:23] god amen
[1:26:25] the anointing and baptism of the holy
[1:26:26] ghost amen
[1:26:28] but brother that wasn't the end that was
[1:26:31] amen that was just a testimony that god
[1:26:33] was moving and moving moving on
[1:26:35] with a greater anointing and a greater
[1:26:37] revelation brother
[1:26:38] in in in the lives of his his sons and
[1:26:41] daughters
[1:26:42] amen and again lord brother understand
[1:26:45] again
[1:26:45] we won't get into all that but again
[1:26:48] that there was just true seed of god
[1:26:50] that would be part of the bride of
[1:26:51] christ
[1:26:52] but then there are also others that are
[1:26:54] just believers
[1:26:55] they're called but not chosen amen many
[1:26:59] are called
[1:27:00] amen well if god
[1:27:03] if god wasn't interested in them he
[1:27:05] wouldn't have called them amen many are
[1:27:07] called
[1:27:07] few are chosen amen so god
[1:27:10] and what they with all that he called
[1:27:13] became a witness to the world amen but
[1:27:16] the few that was chosen was a witness to
[1:27:18] jesus
[1:27:20] that they had the faith that created
[1:27:23] that please god
[1:27:24] amen and faith was growing amen by the
[1:27:28] grace of god
[1:27:29] brother again went on to faith faith
[1:27:31] faith until really
[1:27:32] when they when the pentecostal revival
[1:27:34] went around the world
[1:27:35] they thought well oh we're going to the
[1:27:37] resurrection now we're going to the
[1:27:38] rapture
[1:27:39] this is what god's going to bring it on
[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:42] but no there was another message the
[1:27:45] revelation of the mystery of god
[1:27:47] amen that would give us resurrection
[1:27:50] rapturing faith
[1:27:52] amen what would it do it would let us
[1:27:54] know
[1:27:55] what god was doing and how god was doing
[1:27:58] it
[1:27:58] amen that's why that's why pentecost
[1:28:01] needed to know
[1:28:02] amen well the world in general the seed
[1:28:05] of god
[1:28:06] needed to know about justification they
[1:28:08] needed to know about sanctification
[1:28:09] and they needed to know until another
[1:28:12] generation rose up they needed to know
[1:28:13] about the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:16] and the gifts of the spirit amen and
[1:28:18] finally
[1:28:19] there was a generation that would rise
[1:28:21] that would need to know about the
[1:28:23] resurrection and the rapture
[1:28:24] amen because god threw that generation
[1:28:28] was going to bring into manifestation
[1:28:30] the resurrection and the rapture
[1:28:32] amen not through pentecost not true
[1:28:34] wesley not true and not true the others
[1:28:36] amen but it was going to come to another
[1:28:40] revival a bride revival amen oh yeah
[1:28:43] that's
[1:28:44] that's the lutherans that's the
[1:28:45] methodist and that's the pentecostals
[1:28:47] amen and we're not the brahmites
[1:28:50] no no we're the christians amen
[1:28:53] we're the bride amen you want bright
[1:28:56] eyes what do we want to call it
[1:28:58] amen we're the bride of christ amen
[1:29:01] and brother god brings the separation
[1:29:05] of the believer and make believer
[1:29:08] amen the grace of god god help us
[1:29:10] brother
[1:29:12] amen that will god is good amen
[1:29:15] that what what's going on in our lives
[1:29:16] in your life in my life amen
[1:29:18] is a testimony that we are the seed of
[1:29:21] god and that we are the brain
[1:29:22] predestinated to the resurrection and
[1:29:24] rapture amen
[1:29:26] because god has and god is quickening to
[1:29:29] us the message of the hour the mystery
[1:29:31] of god for this age
[1:29:32] pentecost said the mystery that's just
[1:29:34] that mystery but it they never
[1:29:36] they never received the mystery of
[1:29:38] resurrection and rapture
[1:29:39] amen that was for another generation
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:42] that would climax all that god has done
[1:29:45] down through the church ages
[1:29:46] to god be the glory amen but brother
[1:29:50] and anything that god done anything god
[1:29:53] wanted to do and is doing amen there is
[1:29:56] a seed
[1:29:57] amen that he's going to call out and i
[1:30:00] tell you
[1:30:01] they won't be ashamed of what god's
[1:30:02] doing
[1:30:04] amen they won't be ashamed of what god
[1:30:06] has done
[1:30:07] and what god is doing in their
[1:30:09] generation their age
[1:30:11] they're going to recognize it and
[1:30:12] recognize themselves as seed of god
[1:30:15] by the grace of god amen that we're not
[1:30:19] this church or that church and oh we're
[1:30:21] under this ministry and that ministry no
[1:30:23] we're under the ministry of the holy
[1:30:24] ghost we are the seed of god the sons
[1:30:26] and daughters of god
[1:30:28] by the amen and going beyond sons and
[1:30:31] daughters
[1:30:31] we're the bride of christ amen
[1:30:35] brother you can you can believe yourself
[1:30:36] i'm the son of god i'm a daughter of god
[1:30:39] amen yeah are you bright oh i don't know
[1:30:41] about that
[1:30:43] well the bride is called to the mystery
[1:30:45] of god
[1:30:46] amen and she is not ashamed of what
[1:30:49] god's done
[1:30:50] and she's not ashamed of what he's doing
[1:30:53] and she's certainly not ashamed of what
[1:30:55] he's going to do
[1:30:56] amen so the father god was bringing
[1:30:59] these things in and he was highlighting
[1:31:01] oh he said this one is a shame that one
[1:31:03] is ashamed of this
[1:31:05] amen and they don't want to get involved
[1:31:07] with this don't want to get involved
[1:31:08] with that
[1:31:09] amen but he said we find out through the
[1:31:11] word
[1:31:12] that what god was doing god did this and
[1:31:14] god did that
[1:31:15] and he said the seed of god was not
[1:31:17] ashamed of it amen
[1:31:19] they wanted to be identified with god
[1:31:22] identify with his word identify with
[1:31:24] what he was doing
[1:31:25] amen and they would be the witness
[1:31:29] of god the testimony of god hallelujah
[1:31:32] what god was doing well you you don't
[1:31:36] see what god's doing
[1:31:37] uh well what about this this this group
[1:31:39] over there what was this these
[1:31:40] individuals are no
[1:31:41] they're fanatics that's what god is
[1:31:44] doing
[1:31:45] judge them by the word of god oh
[1:31:49] well they they believe this and they
[1:31:50] believe that and
[1:31:52] then that's why many many a person
[1:31:54] around the world would feel that we are
[1:31:56] fanatical and we are false because
[1:31:58] we believe this because we believe that
[1:31:59] yeah oh yeah
[1:32:01] they want us to identify with a
[1:32:02] denomination they want to identify with
[1:32:04] a church
[1:32:05] or this or that no oh they won't get
[1:32:08] involved with that they say
[1:32:09] you know so they're they're just
[1:32:11] religious no we're spiritual
[1:32:13] they are religious amen god has called
[1:32:16] us out of religion
[1:32:17] to be spiritual by the grace of god
[1:32:21] amen so we're not going to come under
[1:32:22] the control
[1:32:24] of a religious spirit only
[1:32:27] but spiritual amen
[1:32:30] and again his message was ashamed
[1:32:35] and he preached it july the 11th
[1:32:38] 1963 amen
[1:32:42] so i want to share with you and believe
[1:32:45] that the lord has already anointed and
[1:32:47] and brought forth some spiritual
[1:32:50] revelation
[1:32:51] amen but i want to share with you some
[1:32:53] of the thoughts that he was bringing
[1:32:54] forth
[1:32:55] in this message and again to consider
[1:32:58] that he was preaching it in branham
[1:33:00] tabernacle
[1:33:01] amen and we consider the things that he
[1:33:03] was saying
[1:33:04] again i believe it it applied to some of
[1:33:06] those that were attending ram tabernacle
[1:33:09] but it applied to i believe certain
[1:33:11] individuals all the way down through
[1:33:13] because the prophet of god been gone for
[1:33:16] 56 years
[1:33:17] amen or he preached this in july 65
[1:33:21] and in july of this year that it will be
[1:33:25] 56 years amen and that that's a whole
[1:33:28] the prophet was
[1:33:29] when god took him off the scene he was
[1:33:32] 56 years old
[1:33:33] and now in in may month of this year
[1:33:36] it will be 56 years since he's been gone
[1:33:39] amen
[1:33:40] so i pray grace that god will help us to
[1:33:42] keep looking up
[1:33:43] amen that will not doubt what god has
[1:33:45] done
[1:33:46] we'll believe what god has done amen and
[1:33:49] believe what god is doing
[1:33:50] amen where is god god is in his bride
[1:33:53] what's he doing
[1:33:54] well look as you find the brain you see
[1:33:56] what he's doing in the bride

[1:36:42] not our works it's his work to the glory
[1:36:45] of god
[1:36:46] amen so brother brown
[1:36:49] in in the beginning of this message
[1:36:51] right here because he goes to the first
[1:36:53] 17 pages before he gets into the
[1:36:55] preaching
[1:36:55] a sermon and he's just
[1:36:59] this is uh oh my let me see
[1:37:04] yeah they said it's in branham
[1:37:06] tabernacle jeffersonville indiana
[1:37:08] and uh he just gets uh oh yes what it
[1:37:11] was
[1:37:12] was that he had come back from us having
[1:37:14] meetings elsewhere
[1:37:16] and he went into branham tabernacle and
[1:37:18] of course
[1:37:19] uh when brother lee vale saw him come in
[1:37:23] level closed his notes and
[1:37:26] oh he said brother brown was going to go
[1:37:28] to the minister for us
[1:37:30] amen not that brother brown wanted to
[1:37:33] but usually when brother brown would
[1:37:34] come back to jeffersonville
[1:37:36] brother leville always wanted him to
[1:37:37] minister and brother vale
[1:37:39] would step down and turn the pulpit over
[1:37:41] to brother branham
[1:37:42] and this basically is what he did in
[1:37:45] july of 1965
[1:37:47] after he had returned from somewhere
[1:37:49] else amen
[1:37:50] answer brother brown got up and he began
[1:37:52] to just exhort the people and
[1:37:54] and talk to them about the lord and the
[1:37:56] things that god has done and things that
[1:37:58] god was doing amen
[1:38:01] and to remind them of the different
[1:38:03] things
[1:38:04] and again halfway through this message
[1:38:07] he got into it
[1:38:08] preached the word and he went on
[1:38:11] with it with with a scripture that we've
[1:38:13] already read
[1:38:15] and in this book
[1:38:19] he said i want every day of my life
[1:38:23] to count for him amen
[1:38:27] do we have the same desire that we want
[1:38:29] every day of our lives to count for him
[1:38:32] and what i have left what time i have
[1:38:35] i want to spend it somewhere doing
[1:38:38] something
[1:38:39] if it's no more than stand on a street

[1:42:01] not by any means but basically the life
[1:42:04] you live
[1:42:05] it's going to reflect jesus the life you

[1:42:14] of god
[1:42:15] amen and he said i have got
[1:42:20] a little secret place up here at greens
[1:42:23] mill
[1:42:25] and what is that secret place it was his
[1:42:27] cave
[1:42:29] amen and brother
[1:42:32] george smith and sister rebecca they
[1:42:35] found it
[1:42:36] they went looking for it and seemed like
[1:42:39] nobody else knew where it was
[1:42:41] so they knew it was in the area of
[1:42:43] greens mill
[1:42:44] indiana and they knew that somewhere
[1:42:47] going to the cave
[1:42:48] because brother brown had mentioned it
[1:42:50] that he had to walk over some water
[1:42:52] some rocks in the water and step over
[1:42:54] and step over and get to the
[1:42:56] other side because it was on the other
[1:42:58] side was the cave somewhere
[1:43:00] yeah so they went and they did this
[1:43:02] brother george
[1:43:03] and brought sister rebecca and brother
[1:43:06] george's son it might have been william
[1:43:08] amen the individual that's in the in in
[1:43:11] in
[1:43:11] tennessee now amen with his sister
[1:43:15] angela
[1:43:16] amen so they they found that they found
[1:43:18] the cave
[1:43:19] amen and brother george did issue a
[1:43:22] monthly newsletter like and with
[1:43:25] pictures
[1:43:26] and they have pictures of the cave
[1:43:28] picture of they want their sun going
[1:43:30] down into the cave
[1:43:32] they took pictures they went down into
[1:43:33] the cave and took pictures
[1:43:35] of the place where brother banham would
[1:43:37] sit down amen
[1:43:38] oh yes it's right he said it's in the
[1:43:41] cave
[1:43:42] there was there was a section there that
[1:43:43] he could go in and they could sit down
[1:43:45] and he said the there and right in front
[1:43:47] of him was a flat area
[1:43:48] like a table oh yeah that's an and
[1:43:52] and then in the article they printed
[1:43:53] that picture's there
[1:43:55] yeah you you you get into the cave get
[1:43:58] down you got to get down
[1:44:00] then walk into the cave and then and
[1:44:01] it's just like a just like a hallway we
[1:44:04] call it
[1:44:04] amen so you walk up this hallway amen i
[1:44:08] don't know how many feet
[1:44:09] and there was a clear section right
[1:44:12] there
[1:44:12] and then you turned to your left oh
[1:44:14] there was it was
[1:44:16] the seat that he was set on and now to
[1:44:18] see it was just the way the stones were
[1:44:19] made there
[1:44:20] god ordained it for his prophet amen
[1:44:24] and he would go in and he could sit sit
[1:44:26] get him
[1:44:27] between the table and the seat amen
[1:44:31] there was the table shaped like a table
[1:44:34] and there was the seat right here and he
[1:44:36] could sit there
[1:44:37] and above the table was the was the rock
[1:44:41] pointing down and it was like a pyramid
[1:44:44] oh yeah then and there there are
[1:44:47] pictures
[1:44:48] of of that pyramid amen
[1:44:51] coming down pointing down and brother
[1:44:53] brown would sit there and he would study
[1:44:56] amen or sometimes he would get notes
[1:44:58] amen
[1:44:59] and it was when he was there that he
[1:45:01] looked and there was the angel
[1:45:03] the angel came down amen into the cave
[1:45:06] and and yeah told him that he had to go
[1:45:10] and do this
[1:45:10] this and this and this amen brother
[1:45:14] but now of course george remember they
[1:45:16] took pictures of it published it
[1:45:18] but now what they did once they once
[1:45:20] they were finished with it they went out
[1:45:21] and they just covered everything up so
[1:45:23] that nobody would recognize the cave
[1:45:26] so i know but joseph knows where it is
[1:45:28] and no doubt his family knows where it
[1:45:30] is
[1:45:31] but that's it now so
[1:45:34] brother you know be nice if we could go
[1:45:36] there and go into the cave but again
[1:45:39] brother it's not it's not believing the
[1:45:40] cave is believing
[1:45:42] the angel of god that came down and
[1:45:44] ministered to a prophet
[1:45:46] amen and there's where where brother
[1:45:48] brown came in contact with god
[1:45:50] in contact with the angels amen who told
[1:45:53] him that he had to do this
[1:45:54] and he had to do that and so on thank
[1:45:56] god amen
[1:45:58] and that was at greens mill and he said
[1:46:00] indiana and it's not a city
[1:46:02] it's a wilderness and some people have
[1:46:04] taken it over
[1:46:06] and don't even let you set a foot on it
[1:46:08] but i got a cave there
[1:46:10] that he would never find me when i got
[1:46:13] into it
[1:46:14] amen he said i go at night time and
[1:46:18] he'll never know
[1:46:19] when i go in or come out and he don't
[1:46:21] know where the cave is
[1:46:23] and he couldn't get it no matter where
[1:46:26] it was
[1:46:27] amen i want to go over and talk to the
[1:46:30] lord
[1:46:31] he said while i feel that it's a
[1:46:33] necessity
[1:46:34] amen god has somewhere for the prophet
[1:46:37] to go
[1:46:38] totally cut off from the world amen
[1:46:41] so that he could meet with the with the
[1:46:43] angels amen
[1:46:45] and with the lord amen praise the name
[1:46:48] of the lord
[1:46:49] and he said when you get to a spot and
[1:46:51] he said you're so smart
[1:46:53] that you know everything then god can't
[1:46:55] do nothing with you
[1:46:57] but it's if you get to a place that
[1:46:58] you're willing to listen and
[1:47:00] learn amen same with the preaching of
[1:47:03] the word
[1:47:04] you've got to listen and learn amen it's

[1:47:11] ministry of the word the preaching the
[1:47:12] sermon

[1:48:44] recognize that this is god
[1:48:46] amen this is god's pattern this is god's
[1:48:49] ways
[1:48:50] is it because i have set in the church
[1:48:53] this ministry
[1:48:54] for the perfecting the ministry and to
[1:48:57] to do this for the for the people for
[1:48:59] the believers
[1:49:00] we're going to do this do this do this
[1:49:01] amen he's going to feed you for this
[1:49:03] he's going to feed you for that
[1:49:04] amen if the word's going forth and
[1:49:06] you're receiving the word with the right
[1:49:08] attitude and the right spirit
[1:49:09] amen oh god's going to produce and
[1:49:13] that word in you if your attitude is
[1:49:15] right your appearance right

[1:49:23] if you feed on this or feed on that
[1:49:25] people are going to see you oh i wonder
[1:49:28] what they're eating what they're feeding
[1:49:29] on
[1:49:30] and sometimes you you see a certain see
[1:49:33] see them in a certain way and you see
[1:49:35] certain things in that person's life or
[1:49:37] in that person's body
[1:49:38] you say well they must be eating a lot
[1:49:40] of this or they're eating a lot of that
[1:49:42] and so on oh that's the natural source
[1:49:45] of spiritual
[1:49:46] amen the natural is going to reveal
[1:49:49] itself in your flesh
[1:49:50] amen amen and i hear the spiritual is
[1:49:53] going to reveal itself in your soul
[1:49:55] spirit
[1:49:56] and your flesh amen got to come out of
[1:49:59] the soul
[1:50:00] into the spirit amen and then it reveals
[1:50:03] god revealing himself through you by
[1:50:06] grace
[1:50:07] amen so god help us to be spiritual
[1:50:10] amen in our souls
[1:50:13] people got this religion in their flesh
[1:50:15] they got it in their heads
[1:50:17] and to a certain extent it could control
[1:50:20] their spirit
[1:50:21] but it's not out of the soul amen that's
[1:50:24] why the prophet of god says you can have
[1:50:25] the holy ghost in your flesh
[1:50:27] he said he said 24 hours a day and go to
[1:50:29] hell
[1:50:30] well that's true amen because i tell you
[1:50:33] it's christ
[1:50:33] in us in our souls is that what humbles
[1:50:36] us amen
[1:50:40] so he said remember at the day of
[1:50:42] judgment
[1:50:45] let them bony hands reach out of the
[1:50:47] smoke condemn you
[1:50:49] he said their blood will be upon you not
[1:50:51] on me because i have tried for about 10
[1:50:53] years to get
[1:50:54] back amen
[1:50:59] and he said i told my wife and i told
[1:51:02] brother wood
[1:51:03] when i got here and some friends that i
[1:51:05] met yesterday
[1:51:06] he said i have had about five years here
[1:51:09] that i hardly know what to do and he
[1:51:13] said it's been a nervous
[1:51:15] time and he said see the revival itself
[1:51:17] amongst the churches
[1:51:20] and he said the revival died
[1:51:24] amen everyone knows that
[1:51:28] and you feel it in this tabernacle oh
[1:51:31] branham tabernacle the revival was gone
[1:51:34] the revival was dead amen
[1:51:37] he said you feel it in this tabernacle
[1:51:40] amen
[1:51:40] and you feel it everywhere and he said
[1:51:43] there is a thump
[1:51:44] dead feeling and there is just something
[1:51:47] isn't right
[1:51:48] it's because the revival enthusiasm he
[1:51:50] said has gone away
[1:51:52] from the people amen the revival
[1:51:55] enthusiasm has gone away from a lot of
[1:51:56] believers
[1:51:58] amen what the anointing that was there
[1:52:00] when they first come to the word and the
[1:52:02] message
[1:52:02] oh no as i said when i when i ministered
[1:52:06] or even did a song service in in the
[1:52:09] lifetime of accomplishment or false oh
[1:52:11] my in the early days of the message
[1:52:13] there was worship and there was praise
[1:52:14] in the lord dancing in the spirit
[1:52:16] amen now nothing
[1:52:20] of course the church is gone but even
[1:52:22] and not only that
[1:52:24] most of the believers out there now are
[1:52:26] they're gone from a crowd
[1:52:29] back to a dozen but
[1:52:32] in central yeah amazing
[1:52:37] because of the things that have happened
[1:52:39] during the last little while
[1:52:41] yeah it's down down down down amen
[1:52:45] grace of god yeah
[1:52:49] and we know that uh a few of them are
[1:52:51] supporting here now
[1:52:53] you know by the grace of god amen god of
[1:52:56] us
[1:52:57] amen and god keep us humble and sincere
[1:53:01] amen and he said there is just something
[1:53:05] isn't right
[1:53:06] it's because the revival enthusiasm has
[1:53:09] gone away from the people
[1:53:10] amen go into churches and you'll see
[1:53:14] them sitting there
[1:53:15] and the pastor is stumbling around for a
[1:53:17] message and something another
[1:53:19] and the first thing you know he turned
[1:53:21] it off
[1:53:22] on some kind of a party that they're
[1:53:25] going to have
[1:53:26] it seems to be a dead thump everywhere
[1:53:30] what would if the prophet of god said
[1:53:32] that in 1965 what would he say today
[1:53:37] yes it's a dead thought almost
[1:53:40] everywhere
[1:53:42] amen and he said listen billy graham
[1:53:46] noticed it
[1:53:47] he did oral roberts noticed it
[1:53:52] and he said hey alan
[1:53:57] he said he got into trouble i remember
[1:53:59] that because we used to get a allen's
[1:54:02] magazine every month amen
[1:54:07] and if you were to go to tucson

[1:54:15] where brother green is was
[1:54:19] in tucson tucson okay yeah tucson that's

[1:54:30] drive
[1:54:30] a little further west
[1:54:33] yeah going to further west and uh
[1:54:37] and then on on your right side just
[1:54:39] drive for maybe a few minutes
[1:54:41] and then you turn on your right side and
[1:54:43] you look down and you see some buildings
[1:54:46] and it used to be a a allen headquarters
[1:54:51] hey allen's church yeah and
[1:54:55] that's where thousands of people would
[1:54:56] meet there under the ministry of a.a

[1:55:18] allen's ministry amen or we know that he
[1:55:21] had these problems this problem that
[1:55:22] problem

[2:03:41] same ongoing thirst for the resurrection
[2:03:43] rapture
[2:03:44] as as brother branham did amen he knew
[2:03:47] and yet he also knew eventually the lord
[2:03:49] revealed to him
[2:03:50] that he would go before the resurrection
[2:03:54] amen grace but he said one day
[2:03:57] he said they'll arise on the earth and
[2:03:59] he said
[2:04:00] some woman some man he said might be
[2:04:02] some boy some girl

[2:17:18] in your life
[2:17:19] we don't even have a church to go to
[2:17:22] nothing
[2:17:23] and he said the people are almost
[2:17:24] perished spiritually
[2:17:26] i notice it in the people that come out
[2:17:29] there
[2:17:30] and see the differences in them watching

[2:17:46] and he said these trees would be cactus
[2:17:48] and them leaves just wind up and make
[2:17:51] stickery
[2:17:51] and he said that's the way it is when
[2:17:53] you get dried
[2:17:54] around the church everybody is sticking
[2:17:57] one another
[2:17:58] and he said see you've got to have soft
[2:18:01] waters
[2:18:02] of rain soften you up amen
[2:18:06] and make leaves and shade for the
[2:18:09] pilgrim that passes by
[2:18:12] amen
[2:18:15] amen
[2:18:19] i just finished with another quote
[2:18:23] grace amen
[2:18:28] he said your bible now listen to listen
[2:18:30] to me
[2:18:32] and let me say this
[2:18:35] let me say don't do this it's a good
[2:18:38] thing
[2:18:41] and he said lord it used to be when a
[2:18:44] dreamer dreamed the dream
[2:18:46] and they took it down to the urum of
[2:18:48] thummim and told it
[2:18:50] and he said if the urum of them flashed
[2:18:53] the lights back is it a supernatural
[2:18:56] light the dream was true
[2:18:58] and i said but the priesthood and that
[2:19:00] uramutham is done away with
[2:19:02] and your bible is the urum of thumb now
[2:19:06] amen right amen and he said lord i may
[2:19:10] never do this again but i've asked you
[2:19:13] and prayed to you
[2:19:14] to give me a vision speak to me about
[2:19:17] what i
[2:19:18] am dreaming why i'm dreaming these
[2:19:20] dreams
[2:19:21] amen i said
[2:19:25] surely there is something in this word
[2:19:27] of god from
[2:19:28] genesis to revelation that some
[2:19:30] character in there
[2:19:31] that you dealt with would be the same
[2:19:33] basis that would be
[2:19:35] my question if somebody done something
[2:19:38] and you got after him about it then let
[2:19:41] me turn to that place in the bible
[2:19:44] and if somebody whatever they done it'll
[2:19:46] lean
[2:19:47] my way let me see some character in the
[2:19:50] bible
[2:19:51] like that and i close my eyes and just
[2:19:54] let the bible fall open
[2:19:56] and i put my finger on the scripture
