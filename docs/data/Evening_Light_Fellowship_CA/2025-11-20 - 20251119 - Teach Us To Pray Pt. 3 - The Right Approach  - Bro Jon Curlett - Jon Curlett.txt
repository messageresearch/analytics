I'm just passing through. Amen. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing [music] through. My treasures are laid [singing] up somewhere beyond the blue.

I give my life to the potter's [music and singing] hand. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, that's certainly our prayer tonight. Lord, that you could take your word, Lord. You could quicken it by your spirit [music] and you could mold us, Lord, into the very image that you had of us before the foundation of the [music] world, Lord God. Lord, we want to step into the heavenly kingdom, Lord. We want to step back into eternity. We want to step back into your thoughts, into your will, and into your way, heavenly father. Lord, and that's why we've gathered tonight, Lord, is to let your word do a [music] work, Lord. that your spirit would take it, Lord. That it would make it live in us, Lord. That it would just stir our hearts and stir our souls, Lord. That it would move from the eternal, Lord, into the temporal, Lord, and change these bodies, Lord. Change these minds and bring them into subjection to you, Lord. We pray you take this service, Lord. That you would speak to your [music] people, your bride that's gathered, Lord. May you just minister on this Wednesday night, Lord. Encourage us for our walk, Lord. Correct us, give us direction. Lord, lead us and guide us. we pray. Heavenly Father, in your name we ask and pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would to Psalms chapter 143. Psalms 143. Amen. God bless you. Good to see each one that's made it here tonight. Certainly getting colder out there and darker. Amen. But we trust there's sunshine and warmth coming sometime ahead in six months or so, maybe. Amen. Unless you happen to get away and go south somewhere. Amen. Psalms 143 and verse one says, "Hear my prayer, O Lord. Give ear to my supplications, but watch how David says this." In thy faithfulness, answer me, and in thy righteousness. Let's go to verse eight. He says, "Cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning, for in thee do I trust. Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for I lift up my soul unto thee." Verse 10, teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God, thy spirit is good. Lead me into the land of uprightness. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats tonight. And we're continuing our Wednesday night series on teach us to pray. And I want to take a a thought tonight on the the right approach. And this is going to be pretty simple stuff, but I think when we're getting into prayer, it ought to be simple stuff because everybody's supposed to be able to pray and pray effectively and know how they're supposed to pray. But we're going to dig into this tonight and see where it kind of applies to our lives. And I want to start with the quote that we ended with last service. And it kind of gives us a kick, I think, in the pants and or the skirt as the the need may be. But we sometimes we need a wake up. Sometimes we God just needs to kind of come along and give us a little tap, give us a little kick to get us out of our doldrums, to get us out of our our channels and our grooves and our ruts that we get into. And this was supposed to kind of knock us out of the idea of saying a prayer and getting into the idea of praying, communing with God, having fellowship with God. And brother Brown would say this. He says, "Quit your formal worship." Quit your formal worship. What's he talking about? doing the same thing the same way every time. Prescriptive worship. This is the way we're going to do it. And this can be a real challenge for a preacher. It can be a real challenge for a song leader that we're just going to do it the same way every time. We're going to sing the song all the way through and then we're going to repeat one verse and we're going to repeat the chorus once and then we're going to move on to the next song. Or we we can only sing a song three times otherwise the people will get tired or it gets repetitive. No, we can't do that. We don't have to sing every service, have two slow songs, a fast song, a sort of fast song, and then two slow songs as the pastor comes up. We can have a song service that's all fast songs from start to finish. And we can have one that's all slow songs. We can have hymns on time. We can have more modern song. There's no prescription to this. But the idea of what he's getting at is we become prescriptive. And what we do is we get away from the leading of the spirit. That's formalism is getting out of the leadership of the Holy Spirit. He says, "Quit your formal worship and get into fellowship with him once." He says, "Stop this going to church on Sunday." Again, formality and saying a little prayer every night before you go to bed. He says, "And really get out." In other words, get away from that formality. Get away from the tradition. Get away from the distractions and come into fellowship. He says, "My, you'll hurry up and wash the dishes so you'll get back to fellowship again." What does fellowship look like? reading the word and talking with him. That's what we need. He says that's what the world needs today, Christian friend. That's what you need. That's what I need. That's what the whole world needs is back to fellowship to fellowship with him and know him. Amen. So, we saw there that fellowship with God hinges on two things. Reading your Bible, reading the word, and praying. And that's the personal portion of your walk with God. That's the personal portion of your fellowship. And you determine how often. You determine the effectiveness. You determine how far you want him to go. God doesn't determine that. You determine that because you're the one that has to give him the time. You're the one that has to give him the attention. You're the one that has to give him the priority. And fellowship is something that's in our hands. It's in our hands. Amen. You come to church and you listen to the preacher for an hour, an hour and a half on a bad day, uh, twice a week. And that's good. And you have to do that. But the rest of the week, what you do with your time and in growing your relationship with God, that's purely in your hands. Amen. I can't make you get grow in relationship with God. You have to grow in relationship with God. And you've got to be on speaking terms with God, if I can put it that way. And that's what prayer is about. Amen. And that's what this series is all about. Showing the approach and the purpose of prayer and how it's effective in our lives and what God's trying to do in our lives. and then how God's using that to make us effective in other people's lives and in situations and these things. And we've got a a lot of ground to cover in this series. Not tonight. I'm not going to preach long tonight by God's grace, but we've got a lot to cover because there's a lot of questions. Why do we pray and what's God trying to do with it? But the primary element is that he's restoring fellowship. It's personal relationship with him that matters. Amen. And if you've got that, he'll take you all the way through. Amen. Now, when Jesus was here 2,000 years ago, his disciples came to him. They said, "Teach us to pray." And I'm taking inspiration from that on this series when they said, "Teach us to pray." They're what what are they saying? It's not that they didn't have a way of praying. But they said, "Teach us how to pray effectively. Teach us the way that would please God, that would make God hear our prayers. Show us the right way to do that." And listen to what Jesus says. And we're going to just spend our time here this night this night and hopefully kind of expound on it as we go. And Jesus before he tells them how to pray, he tells them how not to pray. Because what? There's a lot of traditions. There's a lot of of leanings that people take. And watch what he says here in Matthew 6. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they shall be heard, for there are much speaking. Now, I think we could preach all night just on this thought because you'll see today people that just want to go on and on and on to appear spiritual, thinking that the longer they go, the further they're going to get with God. Amen. But Jesus said, "I'm going to do it." Don't be wordy when you pray. Don't say things in the longest possible way. Don't say it 18 different times, just with different words. What was I just doing there? I was expounding that out. I was making it longer than it had to be. He says, "You don't need to do this with God. Don't do it." He said, "The heathen do that thinking that the longer they say something, the more of God's attention and blessing and response they're going to get." God is not about length. Like anything of God, it's about quality, not quantity. You'll find that with God. Amen. It's not about these these things. Amen. And so, that's not the way to pray. Jesus isn't against praying a long time. Jesus prayed a lot. We're talking about the man here. He was what? He was trying to get connected to the God that was within him. And he prayed a lot. Paul prayed a lot. Job prayed a lot. David prayed a lot. It's not about whether or not you're praying a long time. It's about what are you saying when you pray. That's what he's getting down to. Amen. It's about the content, not the length that we have. And it's about the sincerity that we have. Not about putting on a show for God or for others. for God or for others. Church, it doesn't impress me if you get up here and pray for 10 minutes. If we ask you to come up and pray, that doesn't impress me. Now, if you pray for 10 minutes anointed with quality to it, a sincerity to it, praise the Lord. But I'll tell you what, we've had people come in and they pray and they they you couldn't get them out of the pulpit fast enough because it was about them. It wasn't about God. And they were trying to impress people with their spirituality, how long they can pray. That is not what we're talking about. In fact, Jesus would warn his disciples. He said, "Then in the audience of all the people, he said unto his disciples, Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms, the chief seats at feasts." He says, "Which devour widows houses." So they'd use the law to take away widows houses. And watch this, "For a show make long prayers." He said, "The same shall receive greater damnation." because they're teaching people to do something God doesn't want to do. They're getting people to put on a show, to put on a facade, to have an image of spirituality rather than being truly spiritual, rather than being truly sincere, rather than talking about what God really wants to hear. The longer we go, the more it is about us. He said, "You don't need to repeat those things with God. You don't impress him with those things." You might impress some people, shallow people, people with a lack of discernment, but you won't impress God. So don't go down that way. But re watch why he says this, and this is such a beautiful thing. Watch why Jesus says you don't need to do that. He says, "Be ye not therefore like unto them. For your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him." Church, I love that God's aware of our situations. God knows what's going on. God not only sees it but his very name Jehovah Gyra means it's God who sees the name the need and prepares an answer for it before you ask. That's the nature of God is that in seeing all things in understanding what's going through our life, he has an answer already prepared before you ask him. So you don't have to beat down his door by telling him everything and droning on and on. Amen. He knows what we need before we ask. But here's the thing. He says he knows what things you have need of. We don't often know what we have need of. We know the need, but we don't know what we have need of. We don't know what will actually fix the problem. I guarantee you, Brother Matt knows a whole lot about this. A client brings you in and he says, "Uh, you know, Matt, I've got a problem with this equipment and here's the problem." Matt goes in there. I guarantee you most of the time it's not what they think. A lot of times I would say it's not what they think. Sometimes it's really obvious, but you dig deeper and you find out where the real problem is. That's where the need is. The need is not the the symptom. The need is what's causing the symptom. Anyone that's been in medicine, I'm not, but when doctors go, we turn medicine into treating symptoms instead of treating the root cause. And God knows the root cause. God knows what we really have need of. Amen. So we don't have to go to God in prayer and prescribe our need. What we have to do is describe our situation because he already knows what's at the root of it. He knows what we have need of. So what we do is we're coming in prayer and we're giving him the situation. We're committing the situation, the circumstances, the thoughts, the the the whatever it might be. And that's the beauty of a true father is that he'll give you what you need, not what you ask for. He'll give you what's really going to benefit you rather than what you really want in your heart. Amen. We have real and physical needs. That's just a a part of being human on this earth. Amen. And we can pray to God for those things and we can provide for them. But remember what Paul said. He says, "I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread." God always provides for you. I'm a testimony of that. Amen. I've made lots of money and I've made very little money, but I've never had to bake bread. I've always had what I needed. Sometimes down to the last second, but I always had what I needed. Amen. But we have to see things in the priorities that God sees them in rather than going in because this flesh rises to the top and it wants to dominate our prayer lives. And let me tell you, church, this flesh is the last thing we ought to be praying about. That's the last thing we ought to be praying about. We'll get into this as we go through this and watch what Jesus would say. Now, we're we're reading from Matthew 6, but this is after he teaches him to pray. He says, "Now take therefore therefore take no thought, saying, what shall we eat or what shall we drink or with wherewith all shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek." Who's a Gentile here tonight? All of us. That's what this world focuses on. So, guess what the influence of this world is, church? to try and get us to focus on that. And that can bleed into our prayer life where that's all we're praying about what we just talked about here. He says, "For all these things do the Gentiles seek. What are we going to eat? What are we going to drink? What will we be clothed? What are we going to do to pay rent? How are we going to get to our work?" He says, "For your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things. But seek ye first something else. Don't be like the rest of He says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you." Now, for those of you that weren't here, I'm going to repeat a testimony we heard on Saturday night at the prayer meeting because Sister Becky gave us a wonderful testimony, and I I so enjoyed it, and and I hope I get this right, Sister Becky. She had a deadline to deliver some ideas to her employer on Thursday morning. So, she was a it was Wednesday afternoon and she had to have some ideas, some some creative ideas and she didn't have them by Wednesday afternoon. So, in her natural, she said, "Well, I'm probably not going to go to church then because I've got something that's due on Thursday morning." The meeting was first thing Thursday morning. But she said something inside her said, "No, go to church." Church, what is that? That ain't God or sorry that's not Satan. That's the Holy Spirit. That's the Holy Spirit that rises up. It raises a standard and says, "How about you try me first? How about you try me first?" And so she committed in her heart to go to church. She reached out to brother Mark and Sister Moren said, "Hey, can you pick me up for church tonight?" And she said, "If I have to stay up till midnight to get this done, that's what I'll do instead." Okay. Now, let's put ourselves in her shoes tonight. What is our natural way of praying from a fleshly standpoint? Our fleshly way of praying would say, "Lord, give me those ideas now so I can go to church tonight." Or, "Lord, help me get those ideas so I'm ready for work tomorrow morning." But if you look at the priority there, what is it? The priority is give me what my work says rather than give me what you said. Okay. Well, what did Jesus say to do? He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom. Seek after that which is eternal rather than that which is natural." Amen. The Jesus is trying to get us off this this total uh idea of just being so caught up in what are we going to have tomorrow? How are we going to be provided for? How are we going to make it through? And so, how do we get those things? How do we get something to eat and drink and clothe? Well, we work for it. So, if I can put it this way, this is Matthew 6 uh 31 and this is the Jonathan Klet edition of the scripture. I hope it's okay. Said, "Therefore, take no thought, saying, I must work to eat and be clothed." Is that a fair description? So, rather than worry about what you're going to eat and drink, I've just replaced that and said worry about work because that's how we get all of those different things. Jesus is saying, "Don't get worked up over your physical needs." He's that he's telling us not to be worried about our jobs or our businesses or our careers so much that they do they dominate our lives and our time and our decisions and our priorities. Amen. That can't be why we do things. But Sister Becky said instead, she said, "Lord, I'll go to church and I'll give up my time to do what you want me to do." God bless her for that. That's the kind of attitude God can bless. That's something God can work with. When you say, "I'm going to give you the priority." God says, "Hey, I can work with a child that's doing that." And what happened after that? Those of you that were here know she committed to going to church. And she did that. And later that evening before she had to stay up and do the extra work, she got an email saying the meeting's been moved till 3 p.m. So now she has the entire next of next of her workday to get all these ideas. Amen. She got to have her cake and eat it, too. Church, do you see what prayer is supposed to do? Prayer is supposed to take us and bring us closer to him and his word, not satisfy the flesh. Not give us what the flesh needs, give us what the spirit needs, give us what the soul needs. Feed the eternal rather than feed the natural. Amen. And that gives him something that he can bless, something he can respond to, something he can take and use because we're stepping into his word rather than stepping into our fleshly nature. He's not looking to bless those things. We and we can step into his word and give him things in proper priority. That's when he can bless us. Amen. That that that testimony from Sister Becky so blessed me because it showed the simp simple way to find favor with God. Simply give him first place. It's that simple. Give him first place and all of those things. Amen. What Sister Becky needed was more time. What was the temptation? The temptation was I need more time, so I'll take God's time. Church, that's not your time to take. It's like tithing. There's a portion that belongs to him, and we don't get to take it for ourselves when we want to. That's the way it works. Amen. How easy is it? It seems like the easiest thing we have these days is we take away from God and we say, "Lord, forgive me. Lord, grant me grace. Lord, grant me mercy." The thing is, you're taking away your grace and mercy by taking away your time with him. And it becomes easier and easier the more you do it the more you take. And you'll waste your time and take his. Amen. Can I be a pastor tonight? When we take away from him, we're not cheating him. We're cheating ourselves. We're actually losing and those things. So, what did Sister Becky do? She committed her time to God. And God said, "I'll give that right back to you. In fact, I'll give you more time than you were going to have." And you didn't have to lose sleep and you could have rest that night. I hope you got some rest that night. Amen. What'd she do? She said, "Lord, I'm going to make you the first priority, church. You can't outgive God. You cannot outgive God with your time, your energy." Listen, I'm not asking you for your money, but you give him your tithes and watch what he does. Church, I'm a I'm a testimony. Many brothers in here have testimonies of it. I was talking with a brother the other day, and we were kind of talking about, boy, you look at what you give at the end of the year, and that's a chunk of money. That's a new car sitting in your driveway. That's a nice vacation sitting in your driveway. Not a new car based on one year's ties, church. It's a car payment. Ain't nobody making that kind of money here. I don't think. [snorts] But you know what I'm saying? You look at that and the carnal mind says, "What could you do with that extra money?" You know what? I'm doing just fine without it. I'm doing just fine without it. And look what the Lord has blessed us with because of that. The grace and the favor that we have. Why? Because we're giving him something to use. Amen. We can't give him too much. We can't give him too much time, too much priority. We can't become too fanatical for him to spend time with him. By that, I mean, amen. Watch what Brother Bram says here. Because God will never leave you forsaken. You commit it to him. You give him first priority. He'll never forsake you. He, Brother Bam, says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." Have you ever witnessed that to be the truth? He says, "Put God first. Pay your tithes first. Pay God." He says, "Pray first at morning. Pray all through the day. Give God the first place in everything. What'll happen? You'll be a witness, church. I want to be a witness of God. I want to be a witness of Jesus Christ daily in my life. How do I get there? Give him first. Put God first. Amen. I have told you before how I used to wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at my phone and check my messages. And then a Holy Ghost anointed preacher came and what did he do? He pinned me to the wall. Brother Dwayne Far came and he preached. I'll tell you what, he pinned a lot of us to the wall. Just cuz you're a preacher or a minister doesn't get you out of the out of the crosshairs. God knows how to nail you down. And he nailed me down. And since that time, I said, "Yes, Lord, that's me. You've got me." And since that time, when I get up in the morning, what I do is I set two alarms. I set an alarm to wake me, and then I set an alarm to get me out of bed. And in between two of those is my morning wake up prayer time. So, it's only 10 or 15 minutes, but that's my time to wake up and spend just a little time with him. And what is that for, church? It sets the tone for my day. It reminds me whose child I am. It reminds me who my daddy is. It reminds me what's important. It sets my mind on him before it sets my mind on everything else. And then from there, I get up, I shower, I I listen to a message while I'm getting ready. Then I go downstairs, I read my Bible, and I pray. And then I come up and eat some breakfast. And what does that do, church? That sets me in a channel that God comes first. That I have given him priority and my day is in his hands. Whether it's a good day or a bad day. Brother Bob called me and gave me a good testimony on Monday. And I needed that cuz Tuesday I had a bad day. My water heater blew up at just out of nowhere. And so I had to fix that all up on Tuesday night. I was glad I'd studied late on Monday cuz I had no time on Tuesday to do it because I was trying to get the hot hot water heater all built up again in the house and everything. But guess what? Whether the hot water heater blows up or I get a promotion, it matters not. My day is in his hands. I've committed myself into his hands. I've given him priority and I trust that all things that happen are for my good. And so in the good times we praise his name and in the bad times do the same. Because we're in an attitude of fellowship, not just running to him every time we have a need. It's a nice thing at the end of the day say, "Lord, thank you for a good day." It's also a nice thing to say, "Lord, thank you for a not so good day, but we got through it anyhow." Because guess what? There's probably more of those than there are days where it was just all sunshine and roses. But what did he say? Put God first. You put God first. That's when you'll be a witness because God's got the priority in your life. What's going to come out is what has the priority. Christ is a priority. You'll become a witness of a supernatural God. Brother say this. He says, "Now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added." He says,"I positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul, their thinking, their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God, that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed. Anybody interested in being a powerful church? Is anybody interested in being a powerful church?" Nine of us. Praise the Lord. How do we get there? Prayerful consideration. Taking all things before the Lord. That's how become you become powerful. Because in yourself, you're not powerful. But when you're standing on the word, when you're standing in his will, when you're in the line of duty, nothing that's no weapon that's formed against you can prosper. Amen. That's when you're going to be a witness for God. And so, if I could set a theme for prayer, I think it's this. seek ye first the kingdom of God. Amen. That's what Jesus said about it. Amen. It's to to focus on our heavenly kingdom, not our earthly kingdom, and those things that are of eternal value, not just temporal value in our lives. And so Jesus continues with them. He says, "Now after this manner, therefore pray ye." So here's how you ought to pray. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Now, I want to say this before we get rolling too far. We don't pray by formula. Okay? Don't walk out of this service and and and go with a checklist and then when you get up in the morning or whenever you you take your time with God, don't go through the checklist. That's not what he's trying to do. He's showing you an approach. He's showing you the attitude. He's showing the the the mindset that we ought to approach God with. Amen. And so prayer, first of all, is communion and fellowship with God. Church, you don't always have to ask God for something when you're praying. Think of it this way, brothers. If every time our wives came to us, all she wanted was something, how would we feel about that? We probably feel a little used at times, more so when we get a little down, a little wore out. But there's times, praise the Lord, where our wives come and they don't want to ask for anything. They just want to hug us. They just want to tell us how amazing we are, how thankful they are for the hard work that we put in every week. Is that right, Brother Matt? Thank you. Got to help me tonight. There's times where she doesn't want to do anything except be with us. And those are wonderful times. Sometimes she just wants to talk. She doesn't want to ask of anything. She doesn't want to take anything. She just wants to talk. She just wants to connect. It's okay to do that. I had a really good day on Monday. And I said, "Lord, thank you for a good day. Thank you for your goodness. Thank you for your provision. Thank you for the sunshine." And that's it. I didn't sit there. This was at the end of the day, you know. Now, now I lay me down to sleep prayer. It's not a long one, but it's a sincere one. But I just said, "Lord, thank you. Thank you." And I was just so thankful for his grace for that day. That's the way we can come in. We don't always have to go in with an intention to get something from him. Amen. But Jesus is trying to get us into this attitude or this approach to God because the right approach, the right attitude will get you somewhere. And we'll see that as we go further into this, the attitude of approaching God. Amen. But the first thing that matters here is one thing. Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. In other words, there's only one God in this equation. You're God. I'm not. Our father which art in heaven. In other words, there's something that's higher than us. There's a being that we're talking to. the omnipresent, omnipresent, omniscient creator of heaven and earth, an eternal being that we are talking to. And his ways are higher than our ways. His thinking is higher than our thinking. His knowledge is greater than our knowledge. Amen. His understanding is above ours. And so when we go into this, we go into it with one thing in mind. We are here to receive, not to tell. We're not going to force his hand. We're here to have him tell us what rather than us tell him what. Amen. We can tell him what's going on, but we're not there to direct him. Amen. We can we can uh uh we can describe, but we can't prescribe. We don't go to a doctor and tell him what's wrong and then tell him what to do to fix us. Amen. When we go to our Lord and Savior, when we go to Almighty God, we tell him what's wrong, but we don't tell him how to fix it. You know how you know your kids are really learning and maturing? When they come to you and they ask for advice or wisdom or experience instead of money or permission. Because isn't that what kids normally want? They want money or permission. But you'll notice that they're growing and maturing when they want what you can give them that will lead them further in their life rather than just resources to do what they want to do. It's the same thing with God. When we come to him and we expect him to share with us his wisdom, his knowledge, his foresight, his depth, rather than try and push ours on him, that's when we're going to get a long ways with God. Okay, here's what he says. Our father which are in heaven, you're above us. As in you're in a you're in a higher plane than we are. Hallowed be thy name. That word hallowed means sanctified, consecrated. And what he's saying is, let your name be kept clean. Now, church, how does God's name be kept clean or be made dirty? Let me ask you this. How could the Curlet name be made clean or dirty? By the way, that those whose name is Curlet act? So, the hallowing of the Curlet name is based on the conduct of Jonathan and Samuel, God help us, and Blanca and Jensen. And our name goes up or down based on how we act and me of course. And of course Selena sitting in front. But we don't worry about her so much. Amen. That's what raises up the name or that's what lowers the name. That's what lowers the name. So it's no different with God. Who is the name of God? Our Lord Jesus Christ. That's the revelation of God for this for this time and for this people. Amen. And so who is named Christ? Who bears the name of Christ? You and I do. We are Christians. We bear the name of Christ. What we do, good or bad, reflects on him. And so the first thing that we're asking is that through us, God will be raised up. God will be sanctified. God will be consecrated. God will be glorified by the lives that we live day by day. So the first thing we come in is we say, "God, you are God and I am not." And the second thing is let my life glorify and consecrate you above all else. Amen. The first priority is that his name is magnified in our lives. Okay. Remember then what does he say once that's done? He says, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven." His kingdom his will. Where's our will, church? lost in his will. That's where our will is. Amen. Remember, there's two kingdoms on earth. There's the kingdoms of this earth and then there's the heavenly kingdom. The earthly kingdom for now is controlled by Satan. Remember, he went to Jesus. He says, "I'll give you all the kingdoms of this earth. They belong to me. If you bow down and worship me, I'll give them to you. You don't have to die for them. You don't have to redeem them. I'll just give them to you." So everything related to politics and economies and society is tied to Satan. So what we have here on earth today as a civilization in no way reflects the kingdom of heaven. It's the exact opposite. Nothing here on earth reflects that. Amen. But remember what Jesus said. He said what the kingdom of God is where? Within you. Okay? And he was pointing to what? The reality of a God that's working within us that's living within us to produce his purpose, his way, his time. And our prayerful request to God therefore is God have your way in this earth. Remember we did a ser a series a long time ago on thy kingdom come. Go back and listen to it. I I dwelt on this a whole lot more if you're bored this weekend or want something to listen to. Amen. But what is it doing? Our prayerful request is God have your way in this life as opposed to have our way in this life. He's got a kingdom and with that kingdom comes a will and that is supposed to be happening in our life. Brother Abraham says this. He says God's kingdom is not of this earth. God's kingdom is in our hearts. It's the spiritual kingdom that we're born into. Jesus said the kingdom of God comes but not without violence. And the kingdom of God is within you. The Holy Spirit, God's kingdom moving in the man governing and controlling him. That's the kingdom. So what is it that defines the kingdom of heaven coming? Thy will be done. That's how you know the kingdom of heaven has come into you is that it's his will being done in your life. So, it's a separating out of our will and a unifying in of his will. That's what his kingdom coming does. Amen. And we'll see through as we go through these things, our fleshly desires do not line up with thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Our flesh has to be crucified for his kingdom to come and our and his will to be done. But as it comes to prayer, a first request of God when it comes to asking him for something is Lord, let your kingdom live in me and let your will flow through me. That's what we ask for in prayer. You say, "I want something from God. Ask for his will." That's what Jesus told us to do. And what does that look like? Jesus showed it usself in the in the garden. The man, the humanity, the flesh body said, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done. And he laid his life down willingly because that was the will of the father. And it's no less for us. Amen. He sought the father's will, not his own. And that's a standard for us. But watch what the father's will is. And I love this when I was studying it. It was completely new to me. We spoke earlier about seek ye first the kingdom of God. And watch how Jesus closes this expression because church, God never takes something away without giving you something greater than what he took. And he's not taking it. He's asking you to give it. You give it up. Remember he talked to the disciples. He says, "Except you, you know, leave your mother and your father and this and that." And they said, "Hey, we've done all those things. What are we going to get?" He says, "You'll get it here and you'll get it in the kingdom to come. More than what you gave with eternal benefits and consequences. Seek ye first the kingdom of God." Then we say, "Lord, let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be done." Watch what Jesus says about this. It's so beautiful. He says, "And seek not ye what ye shall eat or what you shall drink. Neither be ye of doubtful mind. For all these things do the nations of the world seek after, and your father knoweth that you have need of these things. God knows we have natural needs, and God has promised to provide for them. But rather, so in contrast to what everyone else is doing, he's saying, "Seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock, for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." So our prayer life is supposed to be drawing us into the kingdom of heaven life. Amen. Not getting us cozy in the kingdoms of this earth. Okay? That's the simple truth. But what is it God's good pleasure to give us? Good jobs, lots of money, big career, lots of influence. No. God's good pleasure is to give us the kingdom. What? The kingdom of heaven. Amen. And he says here it is God's good pleasure. The original phrase there is he is well pleased. So we could say here for he is well pleased to give you the kingdom. And it's the exact same phrase he said when Jesus came out of the water and he said this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. He's saying the same thing about you as he said about Jesus Christ. In other words, when he says it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom, what he's saying is it is your father's good pleasure to dwell in you. So, what are we are supposed to be praying? Amen. That's the great thing that God has for you tonight. And that's what ought to be at the top of our prayer list is, Lord, make me your child more than I've ever been. Lord, fill me with your spirit more than I've ever had it. Lord, fill me with your spirit cuz I've never had it. Lord, let my life reflect the kingdom life inside of me. Amen. Refresh my mind. Refresh my attitude. Refresh my reproach. refresh my tongue so that your kingdom life can express itself through my life. Listen to this. And this is Jesus trying to show God's regard towards us and what his attitude is towards us when we're asking him for something. And he says, "And he said unto them, which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him, friend, lend me three loaves?" Now, I'm trying to think who's the the late night person amongst us. And I think it's got to be Brother Vichel. He's nodding his head. So, let's put this into names. Brother Vichel comes. Now, I'm the one that goes to bed moderately because my wife gets up early, so I've got to go to bed decently as well. So, it's now midnight. We've been in bed for 2 hours and a knock comes at our door and Brother Vichelo is there and he says, "Brother John, I've got friends over. I need three bags of chips." That's what he's talking about here. Okay. Lend me three loaves. For a friend of mine in his journey has come to me and I have nothing to set before him. That's believable. Bachelors rarely have food. He says, "For he from within shall answer and say, so from my inside the house, I'm not even going to open the door to brother Vichel. Trouble me not. The door is now shut and my children are with me in bed." They're not in his bed. He means they're all in bed, their own beds. I cannot rise up and give thee. You're going to have to go find chips from somebody else, brother Vichel. But he says, "I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend." In other words, Vashel, my friendship with Vichel will not get me out of bed. Okay, I love you, brother V. This is not enough to do it. He says, "Yet because of his importunity, he will rise up and give him as many as he needs." So he says, listen, friendship won't get you out of bed. What it will be will that brash tactless action will so scald you it'll get you out of bed just so you can get rid of this guy. You have no words for him. You have nothing you could say that would reveal to him how much you hate having to get out of bed and give him his chips. But you'll give him his chips just so he'll go away. Okay. Do we have the picture tonight? Can you see my face with brother Vichel knocking on my door at midnight asking for chips? I would probably lose my salvation. Okay, are you with me? Okay, now watch what's happening here. Watch the carryover. Jesus is setting a foundation for us speaking to God and asking. Okay. And I say unto you, ask and it shall be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be open to you. And the church said, Amen. Praise the Lord. But you got to see what he's talking about. He says, "For everyone that askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be open." Church, that's such a beautiful scripture. But you got to see what he's talking about because we can turn that into jobs and houses and careers and money and this and that and the other thing. That ain't what he's talking about. Stay with me. If a son shall ask bread of any you that is a father, will he give him a stone? Jonathan comes to me says, "Dad, I'm hungry. Am I going to go down to the beach and get him a big pebble?" No. I'm going to give him what he needs to satisfy his hunger. Or if he asks for a fish, will he give for a fish? Give him a serpent. Ain't going to happen. Or if he shall ask for an egg, shall he offer him a scorpion? He's saying, "Listen, somebody has a need. What are you going to do? You're going to give them what will satisfy their need as long as it's within your power." So everything is leading up to verse 13. He says, "If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly father give what? The Holy Spirit to them that asking him." What's he saying, church? If you ask for the Holy Ghost, you'll receive it. If you'll seek the Holy Ghost, you'll find it. If you'll knock on his door until he gives you the Holy Ghost, then the door will be opened and you'll receive it. Why? because it is the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. He's desiring to live in you. He's desiring to express himself through you. So when your hearts cry, when your souls cry, when your prayer is, Lord, give me your spirit, that's what you're going to get. That's what he's trying to give us. Amen. It's his father's good pleasure. He's well pleased to dwell in you. He's well pleased to be invited into your life. And when you go seeking for a church, it's because he wants to be in there. It's because he's placed the cry in your heart for him to dwell in there. He said, "Our kingdom is of above. See, we're free, born again. See, act like up there, you're delegates from there." He's saying, "We're from a heavenly kingdom. Start acting like it." When you're an ambassador from Canada, you got to act in a way that reflects where you come from. He said, "I said we're citizens here living here in the flesh, but our spirits, we're pilgrims and strangers. We're foreign to the world now, even our own nation. For we have accepted the invitation when it knocked at our heart to become part of him and his word. He says, "And the word fixes us, makes us live, and makes us act like Christians." What's God trying to do, church? Get us to the place where the kingdom of God is expressed through our lives by the power of the Holy Spirit. And that's the greatest thing we ought to be praying for. Not just to get it, but to keep it there. Not just the seal of your soul, but the spirit, the anointing of it. That'll keep you refreshed in his presence. That'll give you overcoming power. That'll keep your attitude right. That'll keep you coming back to him instead of the things that this world is trying to offer. That'll set such a love in your heart that you don't want anything to do with what Satan throws your way. Amen. How? by prayerfully seeking him, taking all things to him, dwelling on what he has for us rather than what we want for us. That is all temporal. Amen. Prayer is not about me and what I want or what you and you want. Prayer is a time for us to get on God's page to get what he has promised for this time in the season. That's what we're supposed to be doing. Amen. That means we've got to be humble. We've got to be quiet. We've got to wait on him. And when he gives us an answer, be satisfied with the answer and stay with it. Amen. Then and only then do we progress to our natural needs. Watch how he puts it. Give us this day our daily bread. In Luke it says, give us day by day our daily bread. So prayer is an expression then of faith. Because what you're saying to him, I have the natural needs. And so, Lord, give me today what I need today. It doesn't say, "Give us this day our tomorrow bread. Give us today what we have need of. Give us what we need right now." Amen. Why? That shows that we trust him. It shows that God does all things well. That he's an ontime God. Amen. And prayer like this shows us, Lord, we're trusting you. Lord, our lives are in your hands. We're not getting there by the sweat of our brow, but we're getting there by your provision when we put you first in our life. We pray like this. It's saying, "Lord, I know you're my provider. Lord, I know the blessings I get, the provision I get, the food, the clothes, the shelter, the vehicle, whatever it might be, it's in your hands, and I'm trusting you for And when we pray like this, we're saying, "Lord, it's you that makes it happen. You're the one that grants me that favor, church." Because our flesh craves certainty. Our flesh craves stability. And so, our flesh doesn't just want to look at today. It wants to look at tomorrow and next week and next month and next year. And believe me, I'm not saying that we shouldn't look ahead. We're supposed to consider the end to store up for the future in these things. We're supposed to save. We're not supposed to be in massive amounts of debt. We're not supposed to be in debt at all, frankly. But I'm not saying you can't look forward to tomorrow for retirement or or putting things away for for tough days or or loss of a job or sickness or these different things. I'm not talking about that. But the flesh loves to always have something that we can rely on. Money in the bank, food in the pantry. Amen. A cushion. A fallback plan. a fallback plan just in case. We love to have that. And Jesus said, "Focus on today and leave tomorrow to him." Remember in the wilderness, how did God feed them? When they went out of Egypt and they they went around the wilderness for all those years, for 40 years they did it. How did God feed them? Day by day. He fed them with mana. And he put down mana in the morning. They go out, they gather it, they'd eat it that day. The next morning they wake up, all the mana went, nothing left. Next morning they wake up, mana again. Give us this day our daily bread. Now, you had some people, remember, and they said, "Listen, I hate getting up early and getting my mana. So, I'm going to get twice as much today so I don't have to get up tomorrow so I can sleep in." And what happened the next day? It had worms all in it because it was only a daily bread. The exception was on Friday morning. When you woke up on Friday morning, you got to gather for two days because the next day was the Sabbath for them and they weren't supposed to do anything on that day. So God would supernaturally preserve it over two days. But it was daily bread. They couldn't gather man up for the for the lean years, for the lean weeks, for the lean days. It was day by day that they got it. Daily bread means daily faith. Daily bread means daily trust. Amen. And we don't sacrifice our spiritual bread for our natural bread. Then you catch that everything up to this point is spiritual. And then God gets to the natural. Where does God want us focused, church? Natural or spiritual. We can be all settled when we have our daily natural bread and we're completely starving for spiritual food. Why? Because that's where we're focused. When this flesh is satiated, we think we're blessed. And that couldn't be further from the truth. Amen. Sometimes God provides for us to fulfill our kingdom duties and we end up taking that and turning it into our earthly kingdom benefits. Amen. We can so focus so much on his provision for us rather than what that provision allows us to do. I I remember being out west and I saw brothers that were away from home. They're out in the oil field and they're doing these long shifts, you know, three weeks on and three weeks off or three weeks on and one week off and these different things and they would leave their kids at home. They leave their wife at home and she's struggling away there. And after a while, God gave them a job because they desired to be at home. God gave them a job at home and they came back and all of a sudden now they're making church and the family starts to flourish and things start to go real well. And then all of a sudden what happened is you start to see them working overtime and working weekends and missing church and you're scratching your head because you're saying, "Brother, you wanted to get back and now what are you doing? You're taking God's provision, which was to keep you in your kingdom place, and you're using it because you want a bigger house. You want to get a second car. You want to go on a nice vacation. You want to have a quad and a side by side like all the other hunters do. You want to have a new ve, you know, whatever it might be. And what happened is they took their kingdom provision and they turned it into an earthly an earthly seeking. What was it? They weren't seeking daily bread. They were seeking lifestyle instead of eternal life. Amen. They got caught up in themselves and they abused the provision of God because they turned it into something else and all of a sudden they're missing church. And guess what happens? The family just starts to spiral right back down again. I've seen it. It never works out. Brother would say it this way. He says, "It was Moses who was living peacefully, marrying the shake of Midian's daughter, Zapora. And while he was out there hurting the sheep, one day on the back side of the desert was a familiar old path he was walking down hurting the sheep at peace. He says, "Israel was in bondage under slavery, he was thinking on his ways. This is not my job as a sheep herder. God called me to be a preacher." He says, "How do I know that I'm not preaching to a man or woman that's called to the mission fields, and yet you're selling that birthright for a morsel of bread?" He says, "Come to yourself. Think on your ways. See what will it gain you? What will you prosper by if you gain the whole world and lose your soul? He says, "What have you done? Think on your ways." Now, I don't think I'm talking to a bunch of brothers here that are supposed to be preaching, but when we look around at our lives and we look at this church, mostly we're single income families. Amen. And that's it seems like so many times we're trying to make bricks without straw. You almost have to make two jobs to get the income needed to survive these days. And that's the pressure that Satan has ratcheted down on us all the time. And brothers, we feel it, don't we? Those of us that aren't retired, we feel it, don't we? Cuz we got to make the money. And then the pressure shifts to the sisters cuz they've got to preserve the money. They got to stay on budget. That ought to be a four-letter word, budget. Bug g. Because it we hate budgets. You got to stretch $1 to do the work of two. You almost got to be Superwoman or Sister Betty, right? You just got to shop so carefully. You've got to be so so careful with every penny, it seems, you know, and it can be such a stress. And we can think, I've got to do more. I've got to do more. What did Jesus say? Just say, Lord, give me my daily bread. Give me my daily bread. Brothers, let me ask you this question. Are we working so hard for our daily bread that we've forgotten about our God, our family, and our church? Have we given so much to our job that we come in and we're falling asleep, we're tired, we're cranky, or we're not even here. And we can be present here, but not present here. Amen. You can come so wore out from putting everything you've got into everything else that you might be giving time to God, but he's not really getting any quality time. Amen. Well, we say, "I'm working for my family." Are we working for our family? Are we working for our daily bread? When we got enough, why do we keep on working? If we have what's sufficient, then why do we keep pushing? Is it provision that we're seeking? Or is pride pushing us? Is security pushing us? Is image pushing us? Are the Joneses next door pushing us? What is it that drives us so often? Are we trying to make money or make it to heaven? As fathers, as men, we're called to provide and lead, not just provide. And for so many of us, what comes naturally is making the money and putting in the hours. What doesn't come so naturally is the leading the family, the leading the church, working with the local body. Amen. We're called to be present in our family's lives. We're called to be available. We're supposed to be a complete example of a balanced Christian. That's what we're supposed to be. Amen. And that's a that's a life where faith collides with reality and faith wins. because otherwise reality will just come and beat us around because Satan will make it seem like we have no choice. But we do. We always have a choice, brothers. Paul would say, "Listen, let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand." In other words, keep your balance, especially because the days are getting short and everyone else is out of balance. In that time, that's when you need to be most in balance. Brothers, if we're workaholics, what are we going to get? Workaholic families. If we're exercise, we'll get exercise. If we're shopaholics, we'll get shopaholics. But if we're Christians, we'll get Christians by God's grace. Amen. We ought to be showing the balance of a faithful believer, not an over overachiever financially. We're not all called to be rich. Clearly, Jesus said, "It's almost impossible for a rich man to go into the heaven." Easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man. And yet, we'll seek riches. We'll seek after those things. You know, I look around and I believe this goes. I believe the scripture supports it. Most of our lives are pretty frugal and simple. I'm not looking around seeing a bunch of people living high on the hog here. Amen. But we've got to keep that in balance. We don't have to get ahead. We have to get to heaven. Amen. Look at what Paul did. Paul, remember he's talking to the Corinthians. He says, "Listen, I never took your money cuz people accused me of wanting your money and this and that the other." He said, "I've always taken care ofselves and there was other churches that wanted to support me and I did that, but I never took it from you. So nobody could claim that." And what did he do? Sometimes he had to lay down his his Bible and he had to pick up some thread and he had to do some tent making. Paul wasn't afraid to work, right? But there's a time to pick it up and there's a time to lay it down. There's a time to say, "We've got enough and we're going to just stop here and we're going to commit the rest of our time. We're going to commit our gifts. We're going to commit our resources into kingdom purpose rather than trying to get further ahead." Amen. But I want to say this. I believe we have frugal lives, but they ought not to be frugal spiritually. Because I'll tell you this, God is not trying to be frugal with us. Hallelujah. God's not trying to be frugal with us. God's wanting to pour out his blessings, but he's wanting to pour out what is best for us rather than all these temporal things that we tend to get focused on. Amen. So many times we're focused on the flesh and trying to satisfy the flesh, trying to trying to make things easy. And and that's a natural thing to do, church, but our faith gets used up on those things that God has already promised to take care of. And if we could just commit it to him prayerfully, we could move on to the kingdom purpose instead of getting caught up in this earthly purpose. Amen. Our faith needs to be focused on what he promised us for this day. That's to get a bride ready for a rapture. Our prayer ought to be, Lord, I hope I'm getting ready today. Lord, make me a little more ready. Lord, put the garment on a little tighter. Lord, let me reflect you a little more today. Amen. We've got lots of promises in the scripture for our health, for our emotions, for our finances, for all these different things, and I don't want to min diminish those. Amen. But remember, we're supposed to prosper even as our souls prosper. Amen. God's love is based on our spiritual growth, not blessing us naturally. Amen. If God's given us a promise, church, and we have need of it, we ought to pray about it. We ought to go in expectation and faith to God that he would give us that. Amen. And it's an expression of faith alone. Not just will, not just desire, but faith because he says, "I've given it to you." That's our promise. Healing is our promise. That's the children's bread. We don't ever have to stop saying, "Lord, I'm here for healing. Lord, I'm here for deliverance. I'm here for direction. I'm here for guidance. I'm here for the fruits of the spirit." Those are all promised to us. Amen. That's what he wants to pour out us. Amen. But when we go to him, we say, "Lord, here's your promise. Here's my faith. I'm putting it in your hands. Now, in your time, in your season, you give it to me." Because he's got to have character with all of it. It's not just blessings. The greatest blessing is a character we can take with us. So many times our prayer is to ask God to move. And it can't be that way when we tell him how to move. We can say, "Lord, please move." But we can't tell them do it now or do it this way or do it that way. We're just saying Lord by your word I'm trusting what you said by your word. You're going to move now. I give it into your hands. We've said it before. We're going to get into brother R talk about prayer is the greatest weapon. But I've read the quote before where he says the the the ability to commit a thing into the hand of God is one of the greatest weapons given to a Christian. Just lay it in his hands. Prayer is a time to lay it in his hands. Okay. But look at this. We're talking about God not being frugal with his blessings. He says, 'We think we'll exhaust his bountiful blessings. We think, will I ask God to give me my daily bread? I shouldn't ask him too many things. Oh my, he says, could you imagine a little fish about that long, way out in the middle of this ocean, saying, wait, I better drink of this water sparingly. I might run out someday. Could you imagine a little mouse about that big under the great garners of Egypt, saying, "I better allow myself to want a half a grain of wheat a day. I might run out before the next harvest." He says, "My just multiply that by a hundred billion and you try to exhaust God's goodness and mercy." He says he's trying to force his way into you everything he can. Ask abundantly that your joys may be full. He says he wants his people to be happy asking great things, believing for great things. Can we say amen to that? But what are great things is great things. I want a $100,000 a year job, $150,000 a year job. I want a half million home. I saw a really nice home for 1.2 million up in King William Estates today. Lord, I'd like to have that estate, please. Money in the bank, new Subaru in the driveway. Is that the great things he's talking about? No. It's the promises of God he's talking about. He says, "You are a city set on a hill." High ambitions, expectations. He says, "Well, mercy, if we see the blind receive its sight tonight, I want to see the dead raised tomorrow night." He says, "Yes, sir. And I just keep on believing for greater things." What a greater manifestation of God in our lives. A greater expression of the promises of God in our lives. Not the things that make this flesh comfortable. the things that make this flesh want to get out of here. That's what an experience of God will do. It'll set your eyes on things that are higher. It'll set your eyes on things that are not temporal, but things that are eternal. Amen. Church, can I ask us tonight, what are you asking for in your prayers? What requests are you making known to God? And let me say this, if it's something you can buy, you're wasting your time. If it's something you can buy, you're wasting your time because that's not a priority for God because what he has for you is without money and without price. You can't buy it, but it is worth more than anything else you could ever buy. Amen. We're wasting valuable time if what we're asking for is something we can buy. Let's raise our sights a little higher. Let's say, Lord, what does your word say is meant for me today? What does your word promise for the church of this age? Lord, what does your word say about the bride for this age? And start reading those scriptures that will take us into eternity rather than those that will tie us down by ease and comfort in this life. Amen. Let's pray for lost souls. Let's pray for Martha and Anna and David and Sharon and Jenna and Naomi and Michaela. Let's pray for our colleagues, our co-workers. Let's pray for people that can't seem to make up their mind where they're going. Let's pray for healing. Let's pray for revival. Let's pray for the Holy Ghost to move in our services. Pray that the Lord would anoint your pastor so that you could receive what he'd have to say. So that he'd say what you need. Amen. Pray for God to pour out the gifts on us that would edify the body. That we would be healthy. Amen. That would bring a miracle of God's word working in our midst on a daily basis. That we'd have a testimony that we can share. Amen. Leave the daily bread to him and focus on the spiritual blessings he wants for us. And through it all, let's remember this, church. We aren't perfect. Amen. We're going to fail him. We're going to fail each other. We're going to disappoint ourselves. Amen. We are not flawless in our actions. We're flawless through the blood. Amen. We're perfect through the blood. Amen. But there's a remedy. There's a provision made in our prayer life. And Jesus says it this way. And forgive us our debts. In Luke, it says sins. Forgive us our sins as we forgive our debtors. As we forgive those that sin against us. And the point isn't whether it's debt or whether it's sin. The point is what you're asking of him. You need to be giving to somebody else. The way that you approach him is the way that you need to let other people approach you. The attitude you're asking him to take with you is the attitude you're offering. your offering to the person that did exactly to you what you just did to him. Amen. It brings us into a position of equality that we're all sinners. We've all come short of the glory of God. Amen. And the focus here is not so much of what we've done, but it's what we owe because of what we did. And isn't that where we hold things against each other so much? It's not so much that I ignored brother Bob. is that he feels I need to give him an apology for ignoring him. I owe him an apology. I can't take back what I did or what I didn't do. But I owe him something because of what I did. Guess what? We owe Christ because of what we've done. By the law, we owe him our life. But by grace, we owe him our repentance and a request that we would not do it again. So if I've offended brother Bob, what I owe him is an apology. But I can't take back what I've done. It's already done. The hurt's already there. But if he's asking God to forgive him, he's got to forgive me as well. Even if I don't come and do it. And that takes the Holy Ghost. That's why we've got to pray, "Thy kingdom come before we get to this stage." Because it'll take the Holy Ghost to give us the same attitude he has towards us as we would have for other people if we're sitting in a right place with him. Amen. Jesus said, "Make sure you're asking, you're offering what you're asking." Because a bride's always in a position of grace and mercy. And you get into this place, church, and it'll take you out of criticism, judgment, damnation, people getting what they deserve. and it'll take you to a place, Brother Bram says, you'll pray for them and you'll put yourself in their shoes and you'll realize what's going on in their life. That's what I love about our prayer meetings. We get to walk in each other's shoes just for a little brief moment. We see the hardships. We see the struggles, but we also see the testimonies. And we see what God can do when we give things to him. Are we as gracious with each other as we want God to be with us? I say, "Lord, help me. [laughter] Lord, help me. when our rights rise up, when offenses come, and they will come, right? To say, "Lord, let me quash my right to an apology. Let my quash my right to push them away. Let me quash my right to harbor these feelings." and just say, "Lord, help me forgive them as quickly, completely, and easily as you forgive me." Amen. Can we pray that tonight? I say, "Lord, help us to be like that. Help me hold my tongue. Help me push down my rights for their sake." Their sake. Because that's what he's doing for us. It's for our sake, not for his. Amen. Then how does he finish? Lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom. This all belongs to him. Lead us not in temptation. Lord, don't let us fall. Lord, hold us up with thy strong right hand. Lord, anchor us to you, Lord. Tie us to you so that when temptation comes, we can stand. We can pass the test. We can stay on the right path. Amen. Lord, don't let us give in. Lord, keep us from a time of temptation. Our cry here is, Lord, don't let us be led away by our own desires. Keep us focused on what you would have for us and take us there and we know we'll make it through just fine. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand this evening. Amen. I'm not setting you up with a formula. I'm setting you up with an approach. I'm setting you up with a motive and an objective. Why am I praying to my God and Father tonight? Amen. Jesus wasn't trying to put us in a box. He was trying to get us out of our box. Trying to open up a door to where we could have fellowship. Amen. But it comes from realizing that in this equation, we are less than the one we're talking to. and he lifts us up and he elevates us and he sets us in heavenly places. Amen. But he's still God. And what he has for us is greater than anything we could ever come up with on our own. Any need, any desire, any plan, any insight, nothing compares to what he has. And so when it comes to prayer, he's trying to get us to see, hey, what I've got for you is better than what you think you need. So come to me and ask for my will. Ask for my spirit. Ask for my direction. And commit your daily ways to me and watch me prove myself and make me a witness. Amen. Can we do that? Don't pray for things you can buy. Pray for the things he freely offers his children because he's trying to get us into eternity with him. Amen. Back to full fellowship, full dominion, full authority, eternal life. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, such a simple message tonight, but Lord, I pray it struck our hearts, Lord, that when we approach you, Lord, we have our needs, we have our thoughts, we have our opinions, we have our desires, Lord, but in the end, the cry of our heart, Lord, ought to be to get closer to you, Lord, and to be found walking in your will, to be walking in your way, Lord, because we know the greatest blessing ing us to walk in the path that you've chosen for us. Lord, I pray you give us faith to do that. Lord, that we lay down control, that we lay down our plans, our desires, Lord, that we would surrender all those things and run them through your word. Lord, I'm prayerfully seek what you would have for our lives, each one. Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray for this church, Lord. I'm thankful for the people that you've gathered here. I'm thankful for the building you've given us, Lord. But we've got a hell to shine and we've got a heaven to gain. Lord, I pray you help us to resist every temptation that Satan would throw at us, Lord, by prayerfully considering our ways, Lord. That we would bring all things subject to your word, Lord. And having found your will, Lord, let us stay there, Lord, with joy and contentment, knowing that you do all things well, heavenly father. Bless your people, Lord. Bless them in their sincerity, Lord. I pray you make us more sincere day by day. Lord, that we would desire to be closer to you, Lord, with everything that we have. Lord, make this world, Lord, just so distasteful to us, Lord, that we've got nowhere to go but to you. We pray, bless your people now, we ask, heavenly father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. in the presence of Jehovah. 871. In and out of situations, a tug [singing] of war in me. And all day long I struggle [music] for the answer [music] to my needs.

And father, we just want to thank you, Lord, for the word that was spoken tonight. And Lord, you've touched so many hearts, Father, through Brother John's ministry, Lord, thus far. And I know, Lord, that you've you've touched me in many ways, Lord. And Father, I just pray that you continue, Lord, to help us, Father, to lay ourselves aside and that you have complete preeminence in every part of our lives, Lord. Father, does as the brother said, Lord, there's a heaven to gain here. There's a hell to shine. And we see Lord that the enemy is out there as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. But Lord, there's a greater one there that's in us, Father, than he that's in the world. And Lord, we just want to yield to you, Lord. Let you, Father, take control of our lives. Father, by grace, Lord, if we could just become more and more subject, Lord, to your leadership to be able to hear the still small voice, Lord, that speaks, Father, and guiding us and keeping us, Father, away from this world, Lord, and focused upon the things of your word, Lord, which lifts us up in faith and gets us ready for that change. Father, I pray, pour your spirit out upon us all. Father, lead us and guide us in paths of righteousness, Lord, that we might, Father, by grace reflect the very life of Christ in every part of our lives, Lord, each and every day, Father, given you the preeminence. So be with us tonight, Lord, as we go. May you touch those that weren't here, Father. And I pray, Lord, that you would just by grace find a way, Lord, to bring them, Father, back into your presence, Lord.
