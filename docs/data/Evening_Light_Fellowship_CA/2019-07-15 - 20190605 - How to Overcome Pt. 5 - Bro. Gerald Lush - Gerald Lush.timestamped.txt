[56:28] they might praise the name of the Lord
[56:32] turn with me to Romans chapter 12 the
[56:36] book of Romans chapter 12
[56:49] they have already read it in a previous
[56:53] which on this subject but it'll be a
[56:59] blessing again a man Romans 12 and
[57:06] beginning to read again at verse 16 be
[57:12] of the same mind one toward another a
[57:17] man and mind not I things naturally but
[57:25] condescend to men of low estate and be
[57:29] none wise in your own conceits a man be
[57:35] nigh wise in your own conceits but let's
[57:39] be wise in our Lord Jesus Christ have
[57:41] his wisdom and it says recompense to no
[57:45] man evil for evil see again confirming
[57:51] what we have ministered concerning
[57:52] keeping your attitude right and your
[57:54] spirit right a man so recompense to no
[57:58] man evil for evil but provide things
[58:01] honest in the sight of all men and the
[58:05] right attitude and a right spirit a man
[58:08] and if it be possible as much as lieth
[58:13] in you live peaceably with all men a man
[58:17] that takes the grace of God that takes
[58:21] that takes again the the attributes of
[58:24] an overcomer so if it be possible as
[58:27] much as lieth in you live peaceably with
[58:31] all men amen
[58:33] you're going to do what God wants you to
[58:36] do you're going to do what God has
[58:37] enabled us to do but if there's no peace
[58:40] then maybe it's them not you because you
[58:43] have gone beyond to make peace it's
[58:49] their choice to accept it or to reject
[58:51] it amen
[58:53] but we will still live peaceably with
[58:55] all men and verse 19 dearly beloved
[58:58] avenge not yourselves but rather give
[59:02] place
[59:03] under wrath for it is written vengeance
[59:06] is mine I will repay say the Lord a man
[59:12] therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him
[59:16] a mayor brother this is tremendous god
[59:21] help us now i do unto others as they do
[59:23] to us
[59:24] but do unto others as jesus has done to
[59:27] us amen
[59:28] praise the name of the lord so he said
[59:32] if if thine enemy hunger feed him if he
[59:37] thirst give him drink for in so doing
[59:41] thou shalt heap coals of fire on his
[59:45] head amen and it says be not overcome of
[59:50] evil but overcome evil with good a man
[59:55] the grace of God that will not be
[59:58] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[1:00:02] good
[1:00:02] a man by the grace of God and the good
[1:00:06] is the word of God god bless you may be
[1:00:10] seated and turn with me to Revelation
[1:00:12] chapter 3 and again we have read this
[1:00:20] but I want to read it again with another
[1:00:22] thought Revelation chapter 3 and verse
[1:00:28] 21
[1:00:32] to him that overcometh and our thought
[1:00:36] as men and is the message how can I
[1:00:40] overcome there is a reason that God has
[1:00:46] laid this message on the prophets heart
[1:00:50] at some time ago I did give you a quote
[1:00:54] where their private Oh God summarized
[1:00:56] the message summarized why he was
[1:00:59] preaching it and this sorry to his own
[1:01:04] church and as I have already highlighted
[1:01:07] allow me to do it again then he saw the
[1:01:11] need in his own church for this message
[1:01:15] because
[1:01:16] there was many a professing believer in
[1:01:19] Brenham tabernacle there was not an
[1:01:22] overcomer a man the Prophet was
[1:01:25] recognizing that the enemy was
[1:01:27] overcoming them but they were not
[1:01:30] overcoming the enemy then the the world
[1:01:34] and the flesh and the devil was
[1:01:36] overcoming them but they were not
[1:01:38] overcoming the world or the flesh or the
[1:01:41] devil brethren we're going to be
[1:01:43] victorious and we're going to hear
[1:01:45] whether what the Bible is promised that
[1:01:47] we're going to inherit as conquerors a
[1:01:50] man as / as well as overcomers we have
[1:01:54] to have the testimony and the witness in
[1:01:58] our lives that we are overcomers and
[1:02:01] that we have overcome you're going to
[1:02:04] have their witness need that witness
[1:02:06] within you that you have overcome the
[1:02:08] world and you're going to live that life
[1:02:10] showing that you have overcome the world
[1:02:12] you're going to live the life showing
[1:02:14] that you overcome the flesh amen this is
[1:02:18] from this is a tremendous challenge to
[1:02:20] our faith and again you read then you
[1:02:23] have to go forth and live the life there
[1:02:25] so that you have overcome the devil Amen
[1:02:28] brothers with anything anything and that
[1:02:31] God has blessed us with is the victory
[1:02:33] over the world the flesh and the devil
[1:02:36] why because to an arat and here are the
[1:02:39] blessings too good to go from time to
[1:02:41] eternity a man to go out of this body
[1:02:44] need a glorified body we have to
[1:02:46] overcome the world the flesh and the
[1:02:48] devil a man there is no other way out
[1:02:51] brothers but so our Lord that gave it
[1:02:54] gave us the victory he made bike buddies
[1:02:57] by grace through faith
[1:02:59] amen to give us the victory over the
[1:03:02] world the fleshly devil so that we could
[1:03:04] experience a man and the mother not not
[1:03:07] just on the role but to experience it
[1:03:09] now to experience the resurrection and
[1:03:12] the rapture praise the name of the Lord
[1:03:15] as it is written in the word in
[1:03:16] Ephesians there you and he quickened you
[1:03:20] as
[1:03:20] resurrected you as he made alive who
[1:03:22] were dead in sins and trespasses I am if
[1:03:27] I if I got an experience with God if I
[1:03:30] got an experience with Jesus I have been
[1:03:32] resurrected any man and I am resurrected
[1:03:36] and I'm going to be resurrected a man
[1:03:39] with the dead in Christ by the grace of
[1:03:41] God and knowing that I have been
[1:03:43] raptured because the Bible says again in
[1:03:46] Ephesians 2 that an ISA we have been
[1:03:48] caught up into heavenly places in Christ
[1:03:51] amen in Christ Jesus and that is where
[1:03:55] the word is being revealed praise the
[1:03:57] Lord
[1:03:57] so I have experienced that spiritual
[1:04:00] resurrection I have experienced a
[1:04:02] spiritual rapture there brother sister
[1:04:04] that Alleluia amen
[1:04:06] I am in contact with God not in my head
[1:04:08] and not in my mind no no no but in my
[1:04:11] soul and I have been radford in my soul
[1:04:14] hallelujah the resurrection the rapture
[1:04:17] is is in my soul it is on the inside of
[1:04:20] the inside
[1:04:21] amen and our brother never was bringing
[1:04:25] those also concerning the emphasis that
[1:04:27] he was putting on the the prophetic
[1:04:29] ministry and in the office of a prophet
[1:04:33] a man and he was highlighting something
[1:04:36] that the prophet had already explained
[1:04:38] to us and came out of us still here no
[1:04:41] and he drew it on the board there and I
[1:04:44] and I have also drawn it on the board
[1:04:46] and the part of God he did draw it on a
[1:04:49] board but he did draw it on a large
[1:04:52] weight sheet of paper in Brenham
[1:04:55] tabernacle amen and we enter our labor
[1:04:59] day we are we are a we are as God is
[1:05:03] manifested in a three-fold manner
[1:05:05] so we're also manifested in a three-fold
[1:05:08] manner God is really as a father a son
[1:05:11] and the Holy Ghost amen but yet it's
[1:05:14] just one God amen and we and you and I
[1:05:17] we have it where we had the three three
[1:05:20] natures as there were three senses the
[1:05:22] deal with and it what is it is the soul
[1:05:25] or they are you not your spirit it is
[1:05:29] your soul amen
[1:05:31] that's on the inside of these
[1:05:33] and then it is the human spirit and then
[1:05:36] we have to deal with the flesh a man so
[1:05:39] when we were born when we were born then
[1:05:42] naturally a man there was a worldly
[1:05:45] nature on the inside of the inside a man
[1:05:48] Satan and the anointing on the inside of
[1:05:50] the inside and it controlled our spirit
[1:05:53] and it controlled our flesh and we went
[1:05:55] out and we live like the world and and
[1:05:57] desiring the world and the things of the
[1:05:59] world a man that's what we were living
[1:06:02] for but when you were born to gain the
[1:06:04] prophet of God said he said they said
[1:06:07] the Holy Ghost goes into the soul the
[1:06:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul
[1:06:11] amen and we are and what is that it is
[1:06:14] that is the anointing resurrection
[1:06:16] anointing you are they quicken not in
[1:06:19] our flesh not in our spirit but in our
[1:06:21] souls a man and he does it in our soul
[1:06:25] to control our spirit and through the
[1:06:27] spirit to control the flesh amen
[1:06:30] so there the Spirit is going to come
[1:06:32] sunny to the Holy Ghost in the soul amen
[1:06:35] and then the flesh a man this clay is in
[1:06:38] a battle we're in a war with you with
[1:06:41] the human spirit and they in the flesh
[1:06:43] amen the anointing of the Holy Ghost in
[1:06:45] the soul is moving into your spirit and
[1:06:48] to control your flesh to control the
[1:06:51] thoughts and the feelings said the enemy
[1:06:53] is trying to get us a focus on naturally
[1:06:56] a man but brother they were born to gain
[1:06:59] we're gonna focus on and we're gonna
[1:07:01] focus on what's on the inside of the
[1:07:03] inside we're going to focus on the
[1:07:05] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost we're
[1:07:08] gonna focus on the Word of God we're
[1:07:10] going to focus on the promise of God
[1:07:12] we're gonna focus on the will of God not
[1:07:15] my real fathers now you be done by the
[1:07:18] grace of Almighty God but there are too
[1:07:21] many today that are still walking in and
[1:07:23] doing what they want to do but not what
[1:07:25] God wants to do amen
[1:07:27] there still is still subject to the
[1:07:30] Satan's influence in the flesh
[1:07:33] and in their spirit there's a battle
[1:07:35] here a man God is ready to get into your
[1:07:38] spirit and control your flesh and the
[1:07:40] devil is in your flesh a man fighting to
[1:07:43] get into your spirit and to control your
[1:07:45] soul hey man hey man brother he was
[1:07:49] tempting Jesus when Jesus came in in in
[1:07:53] the flash called the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:55] and he went to the Mount of temptation
[1:07:57] and there was the devil a man
[1:07:59] so sane was there tempting Jesus and
[1:08:02] Satan as they uses our flesh to tempt
[1:08:04] God Satan is using our flesh to tempt us
[1:08:07] hey man
[1:08:09] but if we're born again brother is not
[1:08:11] is not me that he's dealing with it's
[1:08:13] God it is Jesus instead he's feeling
[1:08:16] with a man that the part of God said
[1:08:18] remember he said it's not having the
[1:08:20] anointing out here it's not having the
[1:08:22] anointing in your spirit he said we've
[1:08:24] got to have the anointing in our souls
[1:08:25] he says got to be on the inside of the
[1:08:28] inside a man - many have experienced God
[1:08:33] in their flesh and they think they're
[1:08:35] saved but they're not a man and give
[1:08:38] them the trade give to the witness of
[1:08:40] the word and they'll reject this let me
[1:08:41] check that because they feel they don't
[1:08:43] need to do this they don't need to do
[1:08:45] that because I feel God in my say my
[1:08:48] flash I've experienced God in my flash
[1:08:50] well that's good but if he doesn't get
[1:08:53] into the soul we're still we're still
[1:08:55] dead in the eyes of God wish that were
[1:08:58] unrighteous in the eyes of God because
[1:09:00] God is looking into the soul amen God
[1:09:04] wants to get in there amen the imputed
[1:09:06] righteousness of God is not in our flesh
[1:09:09] a man is if it's not in our spirits it's
[1:09:12] in our souls anybody by the baptism of
[1:09:15] the Holy Ghost amen and it's the Holy
[1:09:18] Ghost are they on the inside of the
[1:09:20] inside
[1:09:21] amen what's he doing he is making the
[1:09:24] word flesh a man in the beginning was
[1:09:27] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:09:29] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:09:31] flesh and dwelt among us a man a man and
[1:09:35] he did what he wanted to do so that he
[1:09:38] the life of that body could come back to
[1:09:40] you and me
[1:09:41] man so that he that he would be able to
[1:09:43] get in you and me and doing you and me
[1:09:45] what he was doing in the flats called
[1:09:47] Jesus hey man brother hey brother sister
[1:09:52] what was it it was Reza it was the
[1:09:55] resurrection and the rapture ain't a
[1:09:57] victory over the world the flesh and the
[1:09:59] devil
[1:10:01] this is what Jesus come to do
[1:10:03] that's what Jesus come to prove and
[1:10:05] that's what Jesus come to share with us
[1:10:07] a man victory over the world the flesh
[1:10:10] the devil amen
[1:10:12] so that we'd all had we'd all had an
[1:10:15] eternity a man on the inside of the
[1:10:18] inside a man he came from eternity a man
[1:10:22] the thing of it is he didn't bypasses
[1:10:24] theophany but we did because of our
[1:10:27] natural bird we bypassed earth a
[1:10:29] harmonie
[1:10:30] and we ended up and born in sin sheep
[1:10:33] didn't dig where they come to the world
[1:10:34] speaking lies but Jesus was born without
[1:10:36] sin a man he knew no sin but yet he was
[1:10:40] tempted at all points I guess we are a
[1:10:43] man brother they waited it wasn't the
[1:10:45] Prophet does bring it out here
[1:10:46] concerning what Jesus endured and what
[1:10:50] Jesus went through and but he was he was
[1:10:52] a conqueror he was an overcomer
[1:10:54] a man by the grace of Almighty God for
[1:10:57] your sake and for me hey man so I go
[1:11:00] share with us the life that he had a man
[1:11:03] and brother they they they're they've
[1:11:06] accused Jesus of this that accused Jesus
[1:11:08] of that and and so on and he and you
[1:11:11] know why they're the accuser you know
[1:11:13] they're accused Jesus of being gay why
[1:11:15] but they they they portrayed that any in
[1:11:17] Hollywood and that was that was in a
[1:11:20] film because and they use scripture oh
[1:11:23] yeah
[1:11:24] they didn't just accuse him whether with
[1:11:25] or without this or without that they
[1:11:27] they went to that went to the Bible said
[1:11:29] what did you read this in the Bible did
[1:11:31] you read this they were named one of
[1:11:32] them one of the Gospels and what it was
[1:11:35] was that when I believe it was when
[1:11:36] Jesus was being betrayed into the hands
[1:11:39] of the sinful people in shawnee there
[1:11:41] and they were taking Jesus away that
[1:11:44] this young man came and he ran through
[1:11:46] the group the ran through the disables
[1:11:49] and so on and he was naked anyway
[1:11:54] naked and they they were they rose just
[1:11:59] shocked and amazed and so in the movies
[1:12:02] and in Hollywood they they they sort of
[1:12:04] won't want to indicate that was that was
[1:12:06] a sin that Jesus was guilty off and so
[1:12:10] on brother he was going to be naked but
[1:12:12] not for that reason he was going to be
[1:12:14] naked a man and he was naked on the
[1:12:16] cross a man but he did it for your sake

[1:12:25] sins a man a brand ASA Father forgive
[1:12:28] them for they know not what they do and

[1:12:32] ones that were done at the foot of the
[1:12:33] cross it wasn't just the soldiers it

[1:14:08] but everybody had to get here to do you
[1:14:11] had to do it in such a way so that he
[1:14:12] could come into our souls not just give
[1:14:15] us an experience in our flesh brother
[1:14:17] when Jesus was there in the flesh by the
[1:14:20] scribes the Pharisees the disciples and
[1:14:23] many Jews they they they had an
[1:14:26] experience in their flesh they would
[1:14:27] feel this and feel that oh boy because
[1:14:30] of the power of the anointing that was
[1:14:32] in the body called Jesus amen brother it
[1:14:36] was Almighty God it made flesh in that
[1:14:39] body

[1:14:48] sure you since God some power or some
[1:14:51] anointing you know there from that other
[1:14:52] dimension
[1:14:53] and here here it is in flesh the
[1:14:55] fullness of the Godhead bodily was in
[1:14:57] the body called Jesus now he said that
[1:15:00] the prophet said the foolish legardie
[1:15:02] body is in the brain Amen praise the
[1:15:05] name of the Lord and brother listen what
[1:15:07] he did he lay down his life and picked

[1:15:11] fullness of the Godhead body in the
[1:15:13] bride she lays out her life and many
[1:15:16] millions are laid it down physically a
[1:15:18] married but there's a bride that we all
[1:15:20] laid out spiritually hey man
[1:15:23] because because there there is the elect
[1:15:25] of God when it comes to when it comes to
[1:15:27] the Jews the prophet of God brings it
[1:15:29] out in this message right here and he
[1:15:31] said they said there is the many call
[1:15:33] few chosen and he said there there
[1:15:35] there's the Jews he said that are
[1:15:37] elected and then there are there other
[1:15:39] Jews that are still saved he said but he
[1:15:41] said they didn't all come up in the
[1:15:44] resurrection when Jesus came up and
[1:15:46] Bible says many but not all a million
[1:15:51] and they went into the city and appeared
[1:15:53] on the many a man and the bodies of this
[1:15:56] one the body without were they rose from
[1:15:57] the dead but not all of them the power
[1:16:00] of God said no no he said they're
[1:16:02] waiting for the general resurrection
[1:16:04] Amen the same thing with the Gentiles
[1:16:07] and he said they said a
[1:16:09] the resurrection of rapture he said
[1:16:11] there's going to be the elect of God he
[1:16:13] says going to be resurrected and the
[1:16:15] living Saints go with them they're going
[1:16:16] to be changed and we're going to be
[1:16:18] raptured a man but he said again he said
[1:16:21] the there there's going to be many that
[1:16:24] won't be resurrected
[1:16:25] they're going to be they're going to be
[1:16:27] there he said waiting for a man waiting
[1:16:30] to the it's going to be at least a
[1:16:32] thousand years at the end of the other
[1:16:34] millennial reign amen
[1:16:36] because of a the old veil witness still
[1:16:39] witness the the the bride and the
[1:16:41] bridegroom a man coming together their
[1:16:43] witness may be the the rapture of the
[1:16:46] bride of the bridegroom amen but they'll
[1:16:49] they'll go back into another dimension
[1:16:50] hey man the Bible said the rest of the
[1:16:53] Dead lived not again for a thousand
[1:16:57] years and so on by their they'll be
[1:16:59] there they're going to leave and they're
[1:17:01] there right there they're right there in
[1:17:02] Revelation and the Bible says you know
[1:17:05] they're like their God compares their
[1:17:07] lives for the to the word and the word
[1:17:10] that they knew what was revealed to them
[1:17:12] and so on and they are given eternal
[1:17:14] life and if they're now if their life
[1:17:17] didn't didn't measure up to the word
[1:17:18] that God had revealed to them and they
[1:17:20] had rejected the word they're cast into
[1:17:22] the lake of fire a man but they're the
[1:17:26] bride and the bridegroom is there a man
[1:17:28] doing that amid that judgment so brother
[1:17:32] it is a tremendous revelation that God
[1:17:34] has given us and God is giving us in
[1:17:37] these last days but I pray God in the
[1:17:40] name of Jesus that we're seeing what God
[1:17:42] wants us to see and that we are doing
[1:17:44] what God wants us to do

[1:18:13] we're going back to eternity again hey
[1:18:16] and what is God doing in this hour of
[1:18:18] this age through the Ministry of a
[1:18:21] prophet he's making an end of time hey

[1:18:27] all that's over

[1:28:17] God it's a hunger to thirst on the
[1:28:19] inside of the inside and you repent and
[1:28:22] you're baptized because you want to
[1:28:23] identify with his death burial and
[1:28:25] resurrection and in the name of the Lord

[1:30:19] this is why I feel there has to be a
[1:30:21] ministry you know there is a private
[1:30:24] event has to be a ministry receiving the
[1:30:26] word of the Prophet and expounding it to
[1:30:28] the Saints amen because prior to the
[1:30:31] only of the sea was a part of God say

[1:35:11] of Christ and your brother you're going
[1:35:13] to have the nature of Christ you're
[1:35:15] going to have the attitude of Christ you
[1:35:17] can add the actions and reactions of
[1:35:18] Jesus old brothers is a tremendous
[1:35:21] challenge to our faith to have the love
[1:35:24] that Jesus had to walk in the light as
[1:35:28] Jesus deep to make the sacrifices that
[1:35:31] Jesus made amen
[1:35:34] - to be content as Jesus was content
[1:35:36] with the natural things of
[1:35:38] life brother-sister we going to take his
[1:35:43] advice if you're born again you'll take
[1:35:46] his advice but there's not many
[1:35:49] believers are taking the advice or in
[1:35:51] the counsel of Jesus no no there's dears
[1:35:56] joke because the wise because they're
[1:35:58] not born again they're still governed by
[1:36:01] the natural things of life oh yeah
[1:36:06] prophet of God aside I did those things
[1:36:09] and he highlighted you know where we put
[1:36:12] so much emphasis on vitamins and things
[1:36:13] like that
[1:36:14] they were starting back then in the in
[1:36:16] the early 60s yeah and he preached on
[1:36:19] some vitamins Bible vitamins and I sure
[1:36:28] what the ones he used you might have
[1:36:29] used the vitamin F faith you know and
[1:36:32] the but this vitamin that vitamin this
[1:36:34] is what we need amen the Holy Ghost and
[1:36:37] so on Gospels yes brother he said if he
[1:36:44] said if I had no he said I had pills he
[1:36:48] said that and he said that I said
[1:36:51] nowadays you take these pills that
[1:36:52] you'll be you be healed he said oh they
[1:36:56] wouldn't have room up there for the for
[1:36:57] the prayer line issue did all come all
[1:37:00] to get one of those pills but he said
[1:37:04] I'll give you the Word of God there were
[1:37:06] these stripes you are healed and that's
[1:37:11] the gospel but they won't take that one
[1:37:14] they'll take it in their head but they
[1:37:16] want to take it in the heart and if it's
[1:37:20] in the heart it'll control you it'll
[1:37:24] control your attitude your spirit
[1:37:26] regarding all the rest
[1:37:27] amen amen because our faith is in on the
[1:37:32] inside of the inside it is not what
[1:37:34] we're feeling in our flesh during our
[1:37:36] spirit it is what we have in our soul a
[1:37:39] man by the grace of Almighty God god
[1:37:43] help us brother are we overcomers

[1:40:03] going into enter into the city and the
[1:40:06] angel asked him the password or
[1:40:09] something like that and oh well I

[1:40:50] my faith he said I trusts in the blood
[1:40:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ he redeemed me
[1:40:59] and the angel didn't have to say
[1:41:02] anything or do anything to gain
[1:41:04] automatically open and he went the
[1:41:09] others were focusing on doctrine and
[1:41:12] this teaching and that teaching this one

[1:54:26] this was 19 August 63 he said I feel
[1:54:31] that that third pole is beginning to
[1:54:35] move you see
[1:54:37] it's within me now I want to pray for
[1:54:40] everybody the third pole was in brother
[1:54:43] Branham I trust the third pole is in us
[1:54:48] there at the faith for the resurrection
[1:54:51] the faith for the rapture brother what
[1:54:54] else is there to focus on I'll be honest
[1:54:58] there's nothing else left to focus on
[1:54:59] because everything everything has been
[1:55:03] done we're gone gone beyond the loud of
[1:55:05] seeing Church Shh
[1:55:06] we're in a bride age so what is the end
[1:55:09] of the right age the resurrection record
[1:55:12] so there's nothing else to focus on
[1:55:16] spiritually morning noon and night see
[1:55:22] God is gonna allow this to happen this
[1:55:25] happened naturally to us what for to get
[1:55:27] us to look up it gives me more conscious
[1:55:31] of the spiritual and less of the natural
[1:55:37] so he so I feel the third pole is
[1:55:39] beginning to move he said it's within me
[1:55:42] now I trust it's in you and in me amen
[1:55:48] and we're gonna pray for one another and
[1:55:52] I are praying for one another yes
[1:56:01] as we study this my purpose of this is
[1:56:05] just not to come to fellowship with you
[1:56:08] people which I love to do that and he
[1:56:12] said have I had a chance to do that I
[1:56:13] would come to your home shake your hand
[1:56:16] talk with you eat dinner with you
[1:56:19] he says set out under the shade tree and
[1:56:23] talk and fellowship but he said when we
[1:56:26] come here we are here for one specific
[1:56:30] purpose this is the house of correction
[1:56:36] amen not many want correction because
[1:56:44] it's a generation that does what's right
[1:56:46] in their own eyes that generation
[1:56:50] doesn't want correction and he said this
[1:56:55] is the house of correction listen this
[1:56:59] catch the revelation and be serious and
[1:57:02] sincere he said this is the throne he
[1:57:10] meant the throne the house of correction
[1:57:14] the throne this is the throne of God and
[1:57:21] judgment she goes forth from the house
[1:57:24] of God more serious than what people
[1:57:28] realize
[1:57:34] and he said here is where we come
[1:57:36] together gather in love with one another
[1:57:39] as only Christians can love and we are
[1:57:45] here to take reckoning among us to see
[1:57:48] where our short places are is God
[1:57:53] showing you your short places he said to
[1:57:59] see where our shortcomings and he said
[1:58:03] how can we catch from where we should be
[1:58:06] over to where we ought to be so your
[1:58:12] relationship with god you're here but
[1:58:14] God wants your year but you've got to
[1:58:18] have that hunger and thirst of that
[1:58:19] desire when you come in lord help me
[1:58:22] give me what I need and give me the
[1:58:26] strength I need the wisdom I need the
[1:58:28] revelation that I need Lord and the
[1:58:31] power to do what you want me to do amen
[1:58:36] and he said take reckoning among us to
[1:58:42] see where our short places are our
[1:58:45] shortcoming and now can we catch from
[1:58:48] where we should be over to where we
[1:58:51] ought to be now as I told you he
[1:58:54] preached this because of what he was
[1:58:57] seeing in Batam Tabernacle yeah they
[1:59:05] were getting tired of brother Branham
[1:59:07] preaching these things that's right
[1:59:14] and he said where to where our to where
[1:59:17] we ought to be and he said that's what
[1:59:19] we study he said many ministers study
[1:59:22] those places for their people
[1:59:25] so are we as spiritual as we ought to be
[1:59:32] do we think spiritual talk spiritual
[1:59:38] there was a generation that they
[1:59:41] absolutely didn't build spiritual well
[1:59:47] brother Brown was beginning to recognize
[1:59:48] even the older people in this day was
[1:59:50] losing their spirituality because he
[1:59:57] said it he said if those old folks he
[1:59:59] said lose it and drunk get dry
[2:00:03] he says gonna be bad you know and it is
[2:00:09] it is as I said the atmosphere is not
[2:00:14] like it used to be the anointing is not
[2:00:16] like it used to be we're at the end now
[2:00:20] toddled it got us a lot of it for a
[2:00:22] reason and he did say he did say if he
[2:00:27] didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved
[2:00:30] the Bible tells us to make our calling
[2:00:33] and election sure now it didn't say God
[2:00:37] was gonna do it you got to do it and God
[2:00:41] got to work with you and gotta be there
[2:00:43] to help you oh yeah but you gotta you
[2:00:46] gotta show your hunger and your thirst
[2:00:48] you gotta sure that you want to do it I
[2:00:51] think gotta be on the scene there to
[2:00:54] give you the strength and the wisdom you
[2:00:55] need praise the Lord
[2:00:59] so he administers study those places for
[2:01:02] their people and he said when they see
[2:01:05] the people their lack then they begin on
[2:01:08] that amen and that's why he said in this
[2:01:13] message he said I I know I stood at the
[2:01:18] end of the message there I read it he
[2:01:21] said I know what you're thinking brother
[2:01:23] branham much longer you gonna preach on
[2:01:25] this
[2:01:26] he said I'll preach it till you stop
[2:01:28] doing it amen he was what he was doing
[2:01:34] was trying to correct them and get them
[2:01:35] lined up for the resurrection into
[2:01:37] rapture now he says soon I think that
[2:01:43] the church maybe should be taking just a
[2:01:45] little step higher at this time blending
[2:01:50] into eternity let's take a step higher
[2:01:55] in the revelation of the word and let's
[2:01:59] get more spiritual
[2:02:00] unless carnal amen
[2:02:03] I want to bring the church he said just
[2:02:06] something that you should know I believe
[2:02:09] now
[2:02:10] amen and brother he went on to preach
[2:02:15] after this perfect faith the token
[2:02:19] desperation and souls in prison he's
[2:02:25] trying to get him to be more serious in
[2:02:29] their thinking yeah but more emphasis on
[2:02:34] the spiritual and less on the carnal and
[2:02:39] he said we're speaking on this
[2:02:42] overcoming and he said the word overcome
[2:02:45] you know what it means
[2:02:47] you have got to have something to
[2:02:49] overcome and the number one thing is
[2:02:52] yourself and the nature you're born with
[2:02:56] naturally yeah and this church age that
[2:03:01] the Holy Spirit was speaking about here
[2:03:02] had the loudest see in church age and he
[2:03:06] says we have just meant through it he
[2:03:08] said needed every bukey louder see you
[2:03:12] had to be rebuked because it's
[2:03:14] difference toward Christ to put Christ
[2:03:16] outside in their age and Christ was on
[2:03:20] the outside trying to get back on the
[2:03:22] inside
[2:03:23] he said that's love a man let's pray
[2:03:28] Christ is not outside of us
[2:03:31] but crisis inside of us it's Christ in
[2:03:35] us the hope of glory amen praise the
[2:03:39] Lord for Christ to live in you he's got
[2:03:42] to be he's got to be in you yeah by the
[2:03:47] Holy Ghost he said when he said I'll
[2:03:51] pray the Father give you another
[2:03:52] comforter and a lot of people think it's
[2:03:54] the third person of the Trinity the Holy
[2:03:57] Ghost no I said go on down he saw I pray
[2:04:02] the Father but the Holy Ghost and so on
[2:04:05] in John there but he said I won't i
[2:04:08] won't leave you comfortless he said I
[2:04:11] will come to you
[2:04:15] amen again I told you about the pastor
[2:04:20] of a church that wrote me and he said
[2:04:24] you brethren don't believe the Trinity
[2:04:26] but he said just 3:3 right here he said
[2:04:30] in John I think might be John 14 and he
[2:04:34] said just three right there he said
[2:04:35] Jesus and he said I'll pray the Father
[2:04:38] and he's gonna give him another
[2:04:40] comforter the Holy Ghost so he said
[2:04:43] that's three I said brother I wrote back
[2:04:47] to him I said brother you need to go
[2:04:49] down on another two or three for three
[2:04:50] or four verses I said Jesus said I will
[2:04:54] not leave you comfortless I will come to
[2:04:56] you and you'll know that I'm in the
[2:04:58] father the father and me I in you and
[2:05:00] you would be so I said Jesus and the
[2:05:04] father's one and the Holy Ghost are all
[2:05:06] one and and we're one with them so I
[2:05:10] said now where's your Trinity so he
[2:05:14] never responded I said I said brother I
[2:05:18] said it's warm but brother it's just the
[2:05:22] three offices of the one God everybody
[2:05:25] he did this to reveal his nature as a
[2:05:28] father he did this to reveal his nature
[2:05:30] as a son anybody and and what as your
[2:05:35] brothers your brother your brother and
[2:05:38] revealed to get us the revelation of
[2:05:40] broadbean brothers and sisters in
[2:05:44] a man I pray God looked we're not
[2:05:50] looking at this one looking at that one

[2:06:22] our of our Heavenly Father
[2:06:24] hey man I trust ya I trust you because
[2:06:28] they Amanda then that you got the nature
[2:06:31] of your heavenly Father that I got the
[2:06:34] nature of my heavenly father in my soul
[2:06:37] and I concerned about my flesh is my
[2:06:40] soul but I tell you this it's Christ in
[2:06:43] us working on your spirit and my spirit
[2:06:47] working to what for to bring our flesh
[2:06:50] subject to the word yeah why that
[2:06:54] knowing one day this robot flesh shall
[2:06:56] drop in rice and seize the everlasting
[2:07:00] price and shout well passing through the
[2:07:05] air farewell farewell sweet hour of
[2:07:06] prayer but again if this time when I
[2:07:10] could be destroyed
[2:07:11] the one we're living in not sitting in
[2:07:15] not the pew at this tavern I could be
[2:07:19] destroyed we got one already waiting
[2:07:22] eternal in the heavens
[2:07:25] amen thank God he that liveth and
[2:07:29] believeth in me shall never die
[2:07:30] that's what Jesus said so I prayed we
[2:07:34] got that anointing in our souls we got
[2:07:37] that love in our souls it's defined it's
[2:07:40] eternal
[2:07:41] not natural hey there we go we're moving
[2:07:47] beyond the natural we're focusing on the
[2:07:49] eternal and the spiritual by the grace
[2:07:52] of God
[2:07:55] they're with me moment don't paw Christ
[2:08:01] outside of your life the churches that
[2:08:05] put them out but I trust that we haven't
[2:08:09] put them out of our lives
[2:08:10] don't put them out of your house no no
[2:08:15] no no not just Christ here in this
[2:08:18] church is crazy in you and it's crazy in
[2:08:21] your home by the grace of God Christ in
[2:08:25] your job
[2:08:26] he's Christ in your in your vehicle yeah
[2:08:30] you got to give preeminence to him and
[2:08:35] he said it was Christ on the outside
[2:08:37] trying to get back in the inside now I
[2:08:39] said that's love and the church itself
[2:08:42] in all that put him out but now notice
[2:08:44] is call here is not just the church he
[2:08:49] that overcometh not the church he said
[2:08:52] the church would be seen the church body
[2:08:55] but it's either overcometh the
[2:08:57] individual that will overcome a man and
[2:09:01] he said now he said we see knowing that
[2:09:04] this is the loudest see an age and
[2:09:06] knowing that this age needs a sharp
[2:09:08] rebuke from God
[2:09:10] it needs a sharp rebuke and when our
[2:09:13] clergy gets so soft and dhoti like some
[2:09:16] agent grandfather to his grandchildren
[2:09:19] he said has been said so much that God
[2:09:22] is so much it's such a good God until
[2:09:25] they make God just a dhoti Oh
[2:09:28] grandfather
[2:09:31] he said God's a good God but he's also a
[2:09:35] God of judgment a me and he said but he
[2:09:41] is not a donee Oh grandfather he said he
[2:09:44] is a father a father of righteousness of
[2:09:47] Correction and love is always corrective
[2:09:50] love corrects no matter how bad it hurts
[2:09:54] it's still corrects a real mother will
[2:09:58] correct her children a real dead will
[2:10:02] correct his children
[2:10:08] how does it finish there he said you
[2:10:16] take a Christian that's supposed to be a
[2:10:17] Christian he said led the life of God go
[2:10:21] from him and experience the joy of
[2:10:24] serving Christ and living in the church
[2:10:27] where such as going on he he will rotten
[2:10:30] twice as quick living right under it
[2:10:34] it's like the long he said that I saw
[2:10:38] he said outside the long looked good and
[2:10:43] he said look like a beach a big old
[2:10:47] beach slog and when I jumped on it Oh a
[2:10:50] great chunk of it fell off it was real
[2:10:53] rotten and dhoti and that's the way he
[2:10:56] said the Christians are becoming rotten
[2:10:59] and dhoti that's the way a lot of
[2:11:02] believers are becoming rotten and dhoti
[2:11:05] and he said they've been dead in sin and
[2:11:09] trespasses so long to become dhoti they
[2:11:12] can all no wait at all and he said they
[2:11:15] know what the overcoming means and then
[2:11:18] I began to think of this text overcome
[2:11:22] he's a keep life in you and he said when
[2:11:26] life went out that's what brought that
[2:11:29] log to that condition and it made it
[2:11:32] worse than ever when it laid in the
[2:11:34] branch where the water was a man you got
[2:11:39] to go forth and manifest the life of
[2:11:44] Christ in you it's not you'll become a
[2:11:50] rotten dotI believer he was not if it's
[2:11:57] just in your flesh or in your spirit
[2:12:00] your soul will become rotten but was in
[2:12:07] yer if it's in your soul
[2:12:13] then your spirit and your flesh becomes
[2:12:16] rotten and we're going to have a new
[2:12:18] body amen
[2:12:22] and then now you take a Christian that's
[2:12:25] supposed to be a Christian led the life
[2:12:27] of God go from him and experience the
[2:12:29] joy of serving Christ and living in the
[2:12:32] church where such as going on here odds
[2:12:34] twice as quick living right under it so
[2:12:38] here we are trying to follow the message
[2:12:40] of the hour or at least this part of the
[2:12:43] message we should live constantly in the
[2:12:45] life of Christ by again he's preaching
[2:12:50] to those in his own church that were not
[2:12:52] living the life of Christ he said don't
[2:12:59] you lay around and know these things
[2:13:02] that you're supposed to do and don't do
[2:13:04] it the Bible said he that know what to
[2:13:06] do good and doeth it not to him it's sin
[2:13:09] again not what you did do was what you
[2:13:12] didn't do people go to hell because of
[2:13:16] what they didn't do and as much as you
[2:13:20] didn't do it to the least of these my
[2:13:21] brother you didn't do it to me said
[2:13:23] Jesus so he said you go to the lake of
[2:13:25] fire amen stop and consider what you've
[2:13:33] done but consider what you didn't do
[2:13:35] that God wanted you to do God again
[2:13:40] hidden and revealed in simplicity and he
[2:13:47] said the person he said with that air
[2:13:49] that had hid her in nature
[2:13:51] he becomes Doty rotten when you're
[2:13:53] separated from the life of God so strive
[2:13:56] with all that's in you to stay in the
[2:14:01] life of Christ that you would be fruit
[2:14:05] berry a man grace of God he says the
[2:14:11] ending of time and the blending of
[2:14:13] eternity it is the greatest single age
[2:14:16] and there's more sin in this age than
[2:14:19] there ever has ever been and that's the
[2:14:22] truth what would he say today
[2:14:26] Alvis Ramos Ramos 60 years later brother
[2:14:31] there not many overcomers I trust by the
[2:14:35] grace of God that we are numbered among
[2:14:39] the few overcomers amen
[2:14:42] and that we're going to continue
[2:14:44] pressing on the upward way we're going
[2:14:48] to continue to press on press on into
[2:14:51] the kingdom of God
[2:14:52] press on to the resurrection and the
[2:14:54] rapture by the grace of that brother as
[2:14:58] I said what God reveals in the age
[2:15:05] that's what the people hunger thirst for
[2:15:08] so what's what's he revealed in this age
[2:15:12] resurrection and rapture amen the coming
[2:15:16] of the Lord for the bride to resurrect
[2:15:18] the bride rapture the bride for the
[2:15:20] marriage supper of the lamb and brother
[2:15:22] if there's anything we're hungry and
[2:15:24] thirsty for is the resurrection in the
[2:15:26] rapture and the marriage supper now
[2:15:29] definitely he said in another message he
[2:15:34] said he said God before he does this or
[2:15:39] does that he'll send the Holy Ghost
[2:15:41] ahead to create in the heart of the
[2:15:43] people a hunger for what he's going to
[2:15:45] do and he said then he's a bait then he
[2:15:50] said what are they doing they're calling
[2:15:53] for what he's going to do and then he
[2:15:56] said God is going to respond to the
[2:15:58] hunger and the thirst got to respond to
[2:16:00] the call amen
[2:16:02] so brother in this hour God is
[2:16:06] responding to the hunger and call of the
[2:16:08] bride for the resurrection rapture so
[2:16:11] how much emphasis are you putting in
[2:16:14] your life in your relationship with God
[2:16:16] in your experience how much emphasis are
[2:16:19] you putting on the resurrection rapture

[2:16:29] you

[2:16:33] does as it increase your hunger and your
[2:16:36] thirst for the resurrection your hunger

[2:18:41] spiritual talking spiritual amen long in
[2:18:44] and thirsty for what God has revealed
[2:18:46] amen
[2:18:50] he said his birth when Jesus was born on
[2:18:54] earth he had a black mark to begin with
[2:18:57] he was always received by the common
[2:19:00] people and scorned mostly by the
[2:19:03] religious sect but by the great writ see
[2:19:06] and I mind the people in them days and
[2:19:09] it's just about the way today - - it's
[2:19:13] the same now as I'm trying to say that
[2:19:16] rich or rich see people cannot be saved
[2:19:19] if they'll humble themselves and come
[2:19:23] like the rest of us they can but we must
[2:19:28] all come in one way that's come knowing
[2:19:31] that we are nothing and he is all and
[2:19:34] being willing to surrender ourselves to
[2:19:37] him in order to receive benefits from
[2:19:40] him if you ever get anything from God he
[2:19:45] said you have to humble yourself and
[2:19:47] become nothing before him and know
[2:19:50] nothing but one purpose that is you're
[2:19:54] trying to find Jesus and then when you
[2:19:57] humble yourself down
[2:19:59] God will exalt you but when you exalt
[2:20:02] yourself God will see that you are
[2:20:04] brought to a base that's right he said
[2:20:08] so in his word so brothers sister not
[2:20:14] just humble yourself before the people
[2:20:16] that can be a put on a cloak
[2:20:19] yes but you humble yourself in your own
[2:20:22] mind in your own sight and in your heart
[2:20:25] persuaded that you are nothing less than
[2:20:27] a sinner saved by grace
[2:20:32] in the message wid three witnesses he
[2:20:35] said what is it friends Jesus Christ the
[2:20:38] same yesterday today and forever be
[2:20:42] humble let yourself be the lowest of all
[2:20:47] don't ever exalt yourself if you do
[2:20:52] you're going to become a beast
[2:20:55] humble yourself and God will lift you up
[2:20:58] don't figure that God owes you anything
[2:21:02] remember you owe him all and God's not
[2:21:06] under obligation to us we are under
[2:21:09] obligation to God love him with all your
[2:21:13] heart believe him and God will bless you

[2:48:12] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah
[2:48:17] I've been in a couple of churches this
[2:48:20] week and heard a lot of sermons and it
[2:48:23] seems to be it seems to be a continuity
[2:48:26] here but you were preaching and one of
[2:48:29] those heard preached they can ascend to
[2:48:32] the word and emphasis on Christ in the
[2:48:35] body Christ coming in me Christ coming
[2:48:37] in the body of Christ and that's that's
[2:48:42] what I saw there tonight and it was
[2:48:45] really encouraging because it seems like
[2:48:47] God is moving out of ministry to get the
[2:48:49] pride ready because there's very very
[2:48:51] little time left
[2:48:53] Amen there was an event that dead I
[2:48:56] spotted on one of the news websites it
[2:49:01] was reminiscent of World War two
[2:49:02] pre-world War two and that was that
[2:49:04] where the German government told the
[2:49:06] Jews in Germany not to wear those you
[2:49:10] know macaws because it was attracting
[2:49:12] attention from the radicals and people
[2:49:15] were getting attacked the Jews are
[2:49:16] getting attacked so the people of
[2:49:19] Jerusalem yeah I'm sorry of Germany were
[2:49:22] more on the side of the Jews they said
[2:49:24] we can't have that but it was a sign
[2:49:27] that something is moved that something
[2:49:29] that's getting ready that's just the way
[2:49:31] it struck me that it's closer than we
[2:49:33] think America said it in his prayer so
[2:49:36] it behooves us to ask God to pour his
[2:49:40] spirit eye on us and show forth his life
[2:49:42] in us I mean everything brother Gerald
[2:49:45] said everything that was said tonight
[2:49:46] and what we've heard we need we need
[2:49:51] more of him for sure let's ask him one
[2:49:53] more time pour your spirit on him let's
[2:49:54] sing the first verse again and ask
[2:49:57] brother I like just to close in prayer
[2:49:58] tonight
[2:49:59] praise the Lord no no that's a first
[2:50:03] verse of for your spirit Lord I seek
