[38:14] Lord your promise that you never leave

[38:22] Lord you know each need you know each
[38:24] heart you know each life Heavenly Father
[38:25] though we're asking you to speak once
[38:28] again Lord that you would touch each one
[38:30] Lord that we would know that Lord we've
[38:32] been in your presence Lord that your
[38:34] Holy Spirit has spoken Lord and it's had
[38:37] an effect in each and every one of our
[38:38] lives but remembering those that aren't
[38:40] here remembering especially Lord Brother
[38:42] Paul and Sister Kim home Lord and
[38:44] brother Joe out at Hibernia brother Chad
[38:46] on the roads or just praying a special
[38:48] Grace to them Lord we pray Lord just be
[38:51] with us now we ask in Jesus Christ's
[38:53] name
[38:54] amen
[38:55] amen God bless you thank you sister
[38:57] Maureen
[38:58] it's like we're gone old school back to
[39:00] just one one musician but uh certainly
[39:03] appreciate it hey man we're gonna
[39:06] read from Matthew chapter 7 this evening
[39:08] Matthew chapter 7 and
[39:10] just trusting the lord to bless and
[39:12] we're going in a bit of a different
[39:13] direction this evening as you'll see
[39:16] Matthew 7 very familiar scripture
[39:20] this is Jesus speaking he says ask and
[39:23] it shall be given you seek and you shall
[39:26] find knock and it shall be opened unto
[39:29] you for everyone that asketh receiveth
[39:32] and he that seeketh findeth and to him
[39:36] that knocketh it shall be opened for
[39:39] what man is there of you whom if his son
[39:41] asks bread will he give him a stone or
[39:44] if he ask a fish will he give him a
[39:46] serpent if ye then being evil know how
[39:49] to give good gifts unto your children
[39:51] how much more shall your father which is
[39:53] in heaven give good things to them that
[39:56] ask him amen God bless you can have your
[39:58] seats this evening and as I said I'm
[40:00] taking a bit of a diversion away from
[40:02] our regularly scheduled program on
[40:04] manifesting time and I've had this
[40:06] thought on my heart for quite some time
[40:08] and just felt to bring it tonight and
[40:10] and Lord willing perhaps again on Sunday
[40:13] to finish it out but just to bring an
[40:15] encouragement to the people and and just
[40:17] to give us some understanding as well in
[40:19] some of these things so I want to take a
[40:20] title tonight of when God answers amen
[40:23] when God answers and I'm starting with
[40:25] this wonderful verse in Matthew 7 and
[40:28] Jesus sets us up beautifully for what
[40:30] our expectations should be when we go to
[40:32] him in prayer amen when we go to him
[40:33] with the need and I like it when I read
[40:35] a scripture where God tells me how to
[40:37] set my expectation and then when he
[40:39] gives the absolute that he gives here in
[40:42] this scripture amen it sets me up for
[40:43] expectation we ought to be an
[40:45] expectation amen we've got a living God
[40:47] we've got a God that hears we've got a
[40:48] God that answers and so we have to have
[40:51] an expectation that he is going to do
[40:53] something about our situation and really
[40:55] what we want to talk about tonight is
[40:57] how he responds to situations how he
[40:59] responds to prayers and and God's
[41:01] approach and God's power and God's
[41:03] anointing these different things that
[41:04] that he has at his disposal and the
[41:06] things he set up so if we go back to
[41:08] Matthew 7 he says this ask and it shall
[41:11] be given you seek and you shall find
[41:14] knock and it shall be opened unto you it
[41:18] says for every one that's our absolute
[41:22] everyone that asketh receiveth and he
[41:25] that seeketh findeth and to him that
[41:27] knocketh it shall be open now if we look
[41:30] through those scriptures if you want to
[41:31] see your part in it your part is to ask
[41:35] your part is to seek and your part is to
[41:39] knock that's the only thing that he asks
[41:42] us to do ask seek and knock he's the one
[41:45] that gives he's the one that helps us
[41:47] find and he's the one that opens the
[41:49] doors for us but we're the ones that
[41:50] have to ask we're the ones that have to
[41:52] seek and we're the ones that have to
[41:54] knock now brother brother Brandon would
[41:56] say this because he'd mention these this
[41:58] this phrase ask seek and knock so many
[42:00] times that we see here in Matthew 7 and
[42:02] he would say this he says look at
[42:04] Nicodemus coming to him Nicodemus was a
[42:07] scholar coming to a man that had no
[42:09] diploma he was an aristocrat coming to a
[42:12] pauper
[42:13] he was an old teacher coming to the
[42:16] youth he says see the difference he says
[42:19] but when he came he came with an open
[42:22] heart seeking the truth
[42:25] with all that Nicodemus had with all
[42:28] that he had learned with all of his
[42:29] education his Prestige his position when
[42:32] he came to Jesus he came with an open
[42:34] heart seeking truth and brother Brown
[42:36] comes right behind it and he says you
[42:39] come that way he says just come the same
[42:42] way with an open heart seeking truth
[42:44] seek and you'll find knock it'll be
[42:47] opened ask and you shall receive he says
[42:49] that's it that's the basis that Jesus
[42:52] said to come on so that's why we need a
[42:54] prophet as he comes and he puts context
[42:56] into this because otherwise we have this
[42:58] spiritual buffet in the scriptures where
[43:00] we can ask anything
[43:03] and get anything
[43:04] and that that's not the way God is God
[43:06] is not a Genie in a Bottle where we just
[43:08] with the prayer go up and we rub the
[43:10] bottle and God pops up and he says what
[43:12] would you have me do for you today that
[43:15] that's not the way it is he's not a
[43:16] doting grandfather amen he's a father
[43:18] that knows what's best for us and so
[43:21] what the scripture is trying to get us
[43:22] to do and what the prophet's saying is
[43:24] he's saying this is a means to an
[43:25] approach to get something from God but
[43:28] you've got to come the right way and he
[43:29] says that's with an open heart not with
[43:32] what you know or what you just believe
[43:34] or think in your carnality but this is
[43:36] you coming with an open heart to seek
[43:38] the truth to seek what is right in the
[43:41] situation amen so he's not it's not
[43:44] pointing us to a place where we just go
[43:45] and ask for things
[43:47] it's not where we we we go to to ask for
[43:50] the good things of John but it's where
[43:52] we go for the ask for the good things of
[43:53] God Amen so there's a there's a
[43:55] perspective that comes with this amen
[43:57] and the prophet saying here he said this
[43:59] is to find out what God says not what
[44:01] you say it's to find out what God thinks
[44:03] not what you think is to find out what
[44:05] God knows not what you know amen we're
[44:07] looking for a higher Consciousness we're
[44:09] looking for a higher understanding we're
[44:11] looking for a higher revelation of
[44:13] what's needed to answer our prayer not
[44:16] just to come in and say this is what I
[44:18] want you to do but to come in and say
[44:20] Here's Where I Am What do we do about it
[44:22] if I could put it that way
[44:24] but as I was studying this those those
[44:26] words about asking and knocking
[44:28] resonated with me about that Parable
[44:29] that Jesus would would talk about that
[44:31] widow woman who has gone through a rough
[44:33] time and she was seeking relief from a
[44:35] judge
[44:37] and he was the scriptures calls us the
[44:39] parable of the unjust judge and I want
[44:42] to take us back into it to catch the
[44:43] details this evening just quickly it
[44:45] says and he spoke a parable unto them to
[44:47] this end
[44:49] in other words he said here's why he
[44:51] said this Parable he says that men ought
[44:55] oh okay there's a real reason behind
[44:58] this brother John he's saying the reason
[45:01] I'm telling you this is so that you will
[45:03] always pray
[45:06] he says and not to faint
[45:09] so don't just pray but he says pray and
[45:12] don't faint
[45:13] pray and don't be weak about it pray and
[45:16] don't lose hope don't lose confidence
[45:18] that God's going to answer but he says
[45:19] we are always to pray and not to feign
[45:22] don't let circumstances overwhelm us but
[45:24] go to the one who has the answer or the
[45:27] response to that circumstance amen Jesus
[45:29] is setting the context here he says
[45:31] here's what you're supposed to get out
[45:32] of this parable
[45:34] and he says saying there was in the city
[45:36] a judge which feared not God neither
[45:38] regard to man what we'd say is this man
[45:40] was his own man
[45:42] he didn't answer to God he didn't
[45:43] believe in God he couldn't be influenced
[45:45] he did things the way he thought they
[45:47] ought to be done he was beyond influence
[45:50] you couldn't bribe him you couldn't pay
[45:52] him you couldn't influence them you
[45:53] couldn't do any of these things he did
[45:55] what he felt was right
[45:57] he says and there was a widow in that
[45:59] City and she came to him saying avenge
[46:01] me of my adversary and he would not for
[46:04] a while
[46:06] he didn't think she should he should do
[46:08] anything about it but afterward he said
[46:10] within himself though I fear not God nor
[46:13] regard man in other words I'm not doing
[46:16] this because she's making me doing it
[46:17] and I'm not doing it because God's
[46:19] making me doing it and I'm not doing it
[46:20] because man's making me doing it but he
[46:22] says yet because this Widow troubleth me
[46:26] foreign
[46:27] nobody makes me do anything and I'm not
[46:29] doing it because of her
[46:31] but I'm doing it because she's going to
[46:33] get to me eventually
[46:35] he says because this Widow troubles me I
[46:38] will Avenger lest by her continued
[46:41] coming she weary me so in other words
[46:44] that widow woman kept bothering him
[46:46] every time he walked out of his
[46:48] Courthouse she ambushed him and she said
[46:50] what about my situation what about my
[46:52] problem what about this person that's
[46:54] bugging me when are you going to help me
[46:55] out and she went and she sat outside of
[46:58] his office and she got his phone number
[46:59] she kept calling him through the night
[47:01] she wouldn't let him go and after a day
[47:04] or two he said enough's enough I don't
[47:06] care what the problem is I'm sick and
[47:09] tired of dealing her with her so I'm
[47:11] going to give her relief
[47:13] and this is an unjust man
[47:17] right even though I can't be influenced
[47:20] she's having an impact on me
[47:23] right he says I will avenge your lest by
[47:25] her continually continual coming she
[47:28] wearing me and then the Lord said hear
[47:30] what the unjust just judge saith he says
[47:34] and shall not God avenge his own elect
[47:36] which cried day and night unto him
[47:40] oh that's that's the part that he told
[47:42] us to do remember we ought to pray
[47:44] always but then he says though he bear
[47:46] along with them
[47:48] though he waits
[47:49] though he holds back though it seems
[47:52] like nothing's changing he says yet they
[47:55] cry day and night unto him that's what
[47:57] he's saying keep calling keep crying
[47:59] keep believing keep trusting even if you
[48:02] don't see a single thing moving remember
[48:04] brother Brown would talk about that
[48:06] scripture that says speak to the
[48:07] mountain and if you don't have doubt in
[48:09] your heart then it'll be moved into the
[48:11] ocean and brother Adam says you might
[48:13] not see it he says but just when you
[48:15] spoke it and you believed he says one
[48:17] little grain of sand from that mountain
[48:18] moved into the ocean it started moving
[48:21] you just couldn't tell
[48:23] and he says it'll keep moving until that
[48:25] ocean that thing that mountain that
[48:26] things in front of you is in the ocean
[48:28] brother Ram says this he says if you
[48:30] notice in the scriptures where it says
[48:32] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[48:34] shall be opened he says actually that's
[48:36] not knock like knock him once and it'll
[48:39] be open he that doesn't just say well I
[48:42] went out Lord here I am you want me no
[48:44] that's not it he that seeketh he that
[48:46] knocketh continuation and in the tape it
[48:49] says brother Branham knocks and knocks
[48:50] and knocks he says it has to compare
[48:53] with the rest of the scriptures see the
[48:55] like the unjust judge and the widow she
[48:57] constantly knocked on his door she was
[49:00] persistent if he turned her away today
[49:02] tomorrow she was on his hands again
[49:05] that's the way you want to get God he
[49:08] says be on his hands every morning every
[49:11] night every day all the time constantly
[49:15] he says just keep seeking keep asking
[49:20] keep knocking don't just knock a little
[49:22] while and get tired and go away just
[49:25] keep standing there and say Lord I'm
[49:27] here and I'm not going to leave I'm on
[49:29] your hands now I'm going to stay right
[49:31] here you're getting tired of listening
[49:34] oh that sounds like a bit of an attitude
[49:36] here's the attitude he says I'm having a
[49:40] great time knocking because I know
[49:41] you're coming
[49:43] God help us to have that kind of an
[49:45] attitude I'm knocking and I like being
[49:47] here because I know you're going to open
[49:49] the door at some point you know it's
[49:51] like a child when they know their
[49:53] birthday's coming and you ask them what
[49:54] do you want for your birthday
[49:56] they don't hold back do they
[50:00] because they know
[50:02] they're going to get a present
[50:04] now they that they don't know what
[50:06] present but they know they're going to
[50:07] get at least one present and so they
[50:09] give you a smorgasbord of options
[50:11] right a boil go all the way from a dirt
[50:13] bike or a quad
[50:15] all the way down to a candy bar
[50:18] and he'll give you everything in between
[50:19] because pair Adventure
[50:22] this would be the year of the dirt bike
[50:24] right
[50:25] but they ask unafraidly because you've
[50:29] said it's your birthday what do you want
[50:32] and what he's saying here is God has
[50:34] invited us not just invite us he's
[50:35] commanded us to come to him with our
[50:38] needs to come with him with our request
[50:39] to come with him with our situations and
[50:42] he says but when you get there don't
[50:43] just walk away
[50:45] be persistent in letting him know you're
[50:47] waiting for his answer that you're
[50:49] expecting him to make the answer not you
[50:51] to make the answer that you don't have
[50:53] to force it but he's going to work the
[50:55] situation out right
[50:57] he says amen that's when something
[50:59] happens
[51:00] he says he has to get you off his hands
[51:02] see so he comes out to answer you he
[51:05] says now Faith finds us God help us to
[51:08] be resilient in times of delay
[51:10] amen that's what we need to do because
[51:12] so often what happens is we will we'll
[51:14] be good for a day or two or a week or
[51:16] maybe even a month but as soon as it
[51:18] starts to drag out we must you know what
[51:20] we say
[51:22] that's what I've said must not be the
[51:23] Lord's will
[51:24] if you've got an unction on your heart
[51:26] for something stick with it
[51:29] if the unction goes fine walk away Lord
[51:32] maybe I missed your will and I shouldn't
[51:33] no no but if there's an unction there to
[51:36] approach God then keep approaching God
[51:38] don't let that burn out don't let that
[51:40] die out
[51:41] just because you don't see it happening
[51:43] doesn't mean you missed his will like we
[51:45] said last service the delay of the
[51:47] promise is not even a reflection of
[51:48] God's will or our faith it's a
[51:51] reflection of God's Sovereign choice of
[51:52] when it happens and that and that alone
[51:54] amen but but what the prophet's trying
[51:56] to get us to see is that you'll work if
[51:58] you work inside the intentions of
[52:00] scripture that's where the power is
[52:02] because what it does is all of a sudden
[52:04] it puts you into the place where you're
[52:06] working with God rather than trying to
[52:08] tell God what to do
[52:10] we're not here to tell God what to do
[52:12] we're not here to tell God what to do
[52:14] but rather we're to go to him and say
[52:15] Here's my issue here's my problem here's
[52:17] my situation here's your promise
[52:20] I'm here to claim it
[52:22] and now it's up to him to produce it
[52:24] amen
[52:25] what it puts you in a place to receive
[52:26] rather than to be disappointed but you
[52:28] know sometimes we don't know what to do
[52:30] there's situations I I'm praying about
[52:32] in my own life and in other people's
[52:34] lives and I don't know all the facts
[52:37] and so I don't know how to pray
[52:39] specifically
[52:41] there are things where I know exactly
[52:43] what I'm supposed to be praying for
[52:45] and there are things where I don't have
[52:47] a clue but you know what we've got an
[52:48] answer in the scripture for that and
[52:50] that's in Romans 8 and this is a very
[52:52] familiar scripture 8 28 is of course the
[52:54] one we always know but I like to go
[52:55] before it because it again it gives us
[52:57] the context and it says as for we are
[52:59] saved by hope but hope that is seen is
[53:02] not hope for what a man seeth why does
[53:04] he yet hope for in other words if you
[53:06] can see it that's not hope you can see
[53:07] it there's nothing to Hope about it's
[53:09] there he says but if we hope for that we
[53:11] see not for what we can't see then doing
[53:14] with patience wait for it so in other
[53:16] words if you're hoping for something and
[53:18] it's not apparent that it's coming
[53:20] patience is our response
[53:24] patience is our response
[53:26] right not frustration not fear but
[53:29] simple trust brother Josh's song serves
[53:31] today was perfect simple trust that the
[53:34] answer is on the way
[53:35] that's the response of the believer it
[53:38] says but what likewise the spirit also
[53:41] helps our infirmities
[53:43] oh he's going to talk about our
[53:45] infirmities he's going to talk about
[53:46] something that that's in us that doesn't
[53:48] quite work or doesn't quite function he
[53:50] says for we know not what we should pray
[53:52] for as we ought so this is Paul speaking
[53:55] to us naturally now because in the
[53:58] spirit we can pray certain things and
[53:59] we'll know what to do but he says as
[54:01] humans we don't know the Rights and
[54:03] Wrongs and the ins and outs of
[54:04] situations and we don't know what to
[54:06] what to do and Paul says this is an
[54:08] infirmity a weakness a problem
[54:10] because we know that we're supposed to
[54:12] go to God with things but he says you
[54:14] don't always know how to approach you
[54:16] don't even know what to say you don't
[54:17] know what to ask for
[54:19] but look what he says here's the here's
[54:21] the answer
[54:22] but the spirit itself maketh
[54:25] intercession for us with groanings that
[54:28] cannot be uttered
[54:30] the the
[54:31] and I found this this certainly over the
[54:33] last couple of months and where I've
[54:35] been praying and I just say Lord I don't
[54:37] know what to ask
[54:39] I don't know what to pray and I'll say
[54:41] I've got a a maybe an idea here I've got
[54:43] some insight here and I think this and I
[54:46] assume that and if all those things are
[54:48] true then this is probably the way I
[54:49] need to pray but I don't know I don't
[54:52] genuinely know I don't have first-hand
[54:54] experience in all these things and so I
[54:56] say Lord I've got to place that in your
[54:58] hands and you know that's perfectly
[55:00] acceptable
[55:02] in fact that's wisdom
[55:04] because otherwise you can end up praying
[55:05] against the will of God and that's not
[55:07] what we're supposed to be doing if you
[55:08] don't know put it in his hands
[55:11] but Paul says there's a mechanism here
[55:13] and he says it's the spirit itself
[55:14] maketh intercession for us with
[55:16] groanings that cannot be under and he
[55:19] that searches the hearts knows what is
[55:21] the mind of the spirit because he makes
[55:23] intercession for the Saints according to
[55:25] the will of God so in other words the
[55:27] holy spirit is the thing that goes and
[55:30] prays for us it brings the need to God
[55:33] in a way that God will accept it
[55:36] now look what the Amplified says it says
[55:38] here it says so to the Holy Spirit comes
[55:40] to our Aid and bears us up in our
[55:43] weakness for we do not know what prayer
[55:46] to offer or how to offer it worthily as
[55:48] we ought
[55:50] but the spirit himself goes to meet our
[55:54] supplication and pleads in our behalf
[55:56] with unspeakable yearnings and groanings
[55:58] Too Deep for utterings
[56:00] sometimes you're just so burdened with
[56:02] something
[56:04] and you don't know what to do with it
[56:07] do this
[56:08] hand it over and say Lord take it
[56:10] just take it you see the burden
[56:13] and the only way to relieve it is for
[56:15] you to have your will in the situation
[56:17] so you lay it there
[56:19] but don't worry if you can't explain it
[56:21] don't worry if you can't put it into the
[56:22] right words that's okay
[56:25] lay it in his hands
[56:27] it says the spirit himself goes to meet
[56:29] our supplication and pleads in our
[56:31] behalf with unspeakable yearnings and
[56:33] groanings to deep for utterance and he
[56:35] who searches the hearts of men knows
[56:38] what is the mind of the Holy Spirit what
[56:40] his intent is because the spirit
[56:42] intercedes and pleads before God on
[56:45] behalf of saints according to and in
[56:48] harmony with God's will so catch that
[56:52] thought Church you're praying and you're
[56:53] seeking and you're needing an answer a
[56:55] provision or Deliverance but you don't
[56:56] know how to approach it you don't know
[56:58] the ins and outs of the situations you
[57:00] aren't sure how to sort the situation
[57:02] out and so Paul says you pray but when
[57:05] you pray the Holy Spirit takes that and
[57:08] it translates it into the will of God
[57:11] now I'm not saying that you're praying
[57:13] for it to rain in the whole and God's
[57:15] will is for it not to Reign and so the
[57:16] Holy Spirit takes what you're praying
[57:17] and flips at 180. no no no no no if
[57:20] you're praying opposite the will of God
[57:21] God will deal with you directly on that
[57:23] but if you don't know what to pray and
[57:25] you place it in his hand he says the
[57:26] Holy Spirit takes that and literally
[57:28] turns that prayer into a prayer for the
[57:31] will of God and it literally can be the
[57:33] trigger for God to do something
[57:35] that's an amazing thing to see
[57:38] that when we don't know what to do yet
[57:40] our prayer is still effective because
[57:41] the Holy Spirit takes it and
[57:43] automatically places it in alignment
[57:45] with the will of God now this isn't a
[57:47] get out of prayer free card
[57:49] we ought to seek we ought to ask we
[57:52] ought to knock we're supposed to be
[57:53] looking for truth in the situation but
[57:56] if we don't know what it is then hold
[57:57] our peace and leave it in God's hands
[57:59] until he gives us a revelation or an
[58:01] understanding of these things
[58:02] but we're about to read verse 28 and
[58:05] most of us know Romans 8 28 by heart but
[58:07] but we we look at that so often as God's
[58:10] going to work everything out but what he
[58:12] says is this is really a response to
[58:14] those that don't know how to work it out
[58:17] right
[58:19] it's for when we don't know how to pray
[58:21] or ask that this is a response to and
[58:23] here's the scripture we know well it
[58:25] says for we know that all things work
[58:27] together for good to them that love God
[58:29] to them who are thee called according to
[58:31] his purpose the Amplified says we're
[58:33] assured and we know that God being a
[58:36] partner in their labor all things work
[58:38] together and are fitting into a plan for
[58:42] good to and for those who love God and
[58:45] are called according to his design and
[58:48] purpose
[58:49] that's a wonderful thing that's a
[58:51] wonderful fallback
[58:53] for me when I don't know what to pray to
[58:55] say Lord
[58:56] you can take that prayer and turn it
[58:58] into action you can turn it into
[58:59] something that'll make an event change
[59:01] or make a person change or that'll bring
[59:03] a healing or whatever it might be amen
[59:05] we are able to say Lord I'm laying it in
[59:08] your hands and I'm trusting you
[59:10] regardless
[59:12] we come back to Matthew 7 here and it
[59:14] says
[59:15] or what man is there of you whom if his
[59:18] son has spread will he give him a stone
[59:21] your your son your daughter comes in
[59:22] they say Mom I'm hungry Dad I'm hungry
[59:24] we give him food don't we
[59:27] now we may not give them the food they
[59:29] want but we give them food
[59:31] we don't give them a stone
[59:34] he says or if he asks the fish will he
[59:35] give him a serpent nobody wants to eat a
[59:37] snake
[59:38] he says we'll give him what something
[59:40] that's good for him he says if ye then
[59:42] being evil he's speaking of our base
[59:43] nature know how to give good gifts unto
[59:46] your children how much more shall your
[59:48] father which is in heaven give good
[59:50] things to them that ask him
[59:52] so the thing I want to ask now then is
[59:55] what is good for me
[59:57] and as I'm preaching this evening I want
[59:59] you to think on that thought what is
[1:00:00] good for me because we often have ideas
[1:00:03] of what is good for me is what I'm
[1:00:05] asking for
[1:00:07] Romans 8 28 says all things work
[1:00:09] together for good what because God works
[1:00:11] it out
[1:00:13] so the answer for what is good for me is
[1:00:15] whatever God gives me
[1:00:17] what God's answer is always good if we
[1:00:19] can put it that way whatever God says
[1:00:21] that's good whatever God gives is good
[1:00:24] God's timing is perfect God's Gift God's
[1:00:26] answer God's response is always perfect
[1:00:30] but the problem is that so often the
[1:00:32] answer isn't what we expect and so we
[1:00:34] end up disappointed
[1:00:36] the prayer has been answered in terms of
[1:00:38] the need but because it didn't come the
[1:00:40] way we expected we're disappointed or
[1:00:43] sometimes we even miss the whole thing
[1:00:45] amen because what our expectation is not
[1:00:47] that God will just answer but that God
[1:00:49] will answer in a particular way and
[1:00:52] that's where we get disappointed and all
[1:00:54] of a sudden we're not satisfied or happy
[1:00:55] we've got our answer or we have the
[1:00:57] answer but it's not our expectation and
[1:00:59] so we miss out on it let me tell you
[1:01:02] Naaman the leper got a nice little
[1:01:04] surprise when he went for healing didn't
[1:01:06] he
[1:01:07] he has this little slave girl and she
[1:01:10] says all that that there is a prophet
[1:01:13] here because if they had a prophet or
[1:01:15] then then he could heal my master and
[1:01:17] and her testimony convinced Naaman to go
[1:01:19] and seek out Elisha for healing
[1:01:22] so faith of A Sort brought name into
[1:01:25] Elisha desperation perhaps
[1:01:28] and he rolls up to Elisha's house and
[1:01:31] Elisha doesn't even come out to see him
[1:01:33] a captain a general in the in the Syrian
[1:01:36] Army and the prophet won't even give him
[1:01:38] a personal meaning but rather he sends
[1:01:39] his servant out and his servant says go
[1:01:42] bathe in the River Jordan seven times
[1:01:44] and you'll be healed
[1:01:47] so so the Cure of Naaman is a
[1:01:50] supernatural cure that's been offered
[1:01:52] but Naaman wasn't expecting it to be
[1:01:54] cured that way and he almost missed his
[1:01:56] healing didn't he because remember what
[1:01:58] happened he said there ain't no way I'm
[1:02:00] doing it that's a dirty River
[1:02:04] and the servant said listen if he told
[1:02:05] you to do something tough you'd have
[1:02:07] done it this is easy
[1:02:09] but Naaman had to get his shots and he
[1:02:11] said well the rivers we got back home
[1:02:13] are so much cleaner
[1:02:14] but God had a way provided
[1:02:17] and thank God for naming sermons
[1:02:19] servants because they came and they said
[1:02:21] listen just do it like what do you lose
[1:02:24] yeah you might feel embarrassed you
[1:02:26] might feel dirty but this is what
[1:02:27] they've told you to do
[1:02:29] and in the end Naaman did it and the
[1:02:31] scripture says his skin was like a
[1:02:32] babies that's how much that was how
[1:02:34] perfect God's God's healing was for him
[1:02:37] but yet in naaman's eyes God's answer to
[1:02:39] this to his issue was completely wrong
[1:02:41] it was degrading
[1:02:44] it didn't seem right it didn't it had no
[1:02:46] logic behind it
[1:02:48] there's no special powers there's no
[1:02:50] special cleanliness in the Jordan River
[1:02:52] nothing made sense but God's answer was
[1:02:54] go dip yourself seven times in the
[1:02:57] Jordan River and after the seventh time
[1:02:58] you'll be clean and when he did it he
[1:03:01] was clean
[1:03:02] and just to show that God's provided way
[1:03:05] is not something that always appeals to
[1:03:07] our ego
[1:03:09] doesn't appeal to our our appearance it
[1:03:11] doesn't appeal to our position our
[1:03:12] placing or any of these things but if
[1:03:14] we'll obey him he always meets the need
[1:03:18] but you've got to find out what he wants
[1:03:19] us to do amen and that comes by what the
[1:03:22] word
[1:03:22] the full word
[1:03:24] that that's the problem so many times is
[1:03:26] when we're looking for things we go and
[1:03:28] we look up the portion that agrees with
[1:03:30] what we want in the situation rather
[1:03:33] than taking it from Genesis to
[1:03:34] Revelation amen we don't go to the word
[1:03:37] seeking affirmation we go to the word
[1:03:38] seeking truth and then we place our
[1:03:40] affirmation behind that as opposed to
[1:03:42] put it behind us we get behind the word
[1:03:44] the word doesn't go behind us
[1:03:46] we follow the word it's the thing that
[1:03:49] goes ahead of us amen
[1:03:50] brother Brown would say this
[1:03:53] he says that was God at the beginning
[1:03:55] he says and that's God today he cannot
[1:03:58] change he's the same God he says he
[1:04:00] heals by faith
[1:04:02] that's the way he said it at the
[1:04:04] beginning that's the mark he laid down
[1:04:05] not by your salvation not by your
[1:04:07] goodness not by your money not by your
[1:04:09] affiliation with church but by your
[1:04:11] faith that's what it is if you can't
[1:04:13] believe it he will make himself known
[1:04:15] that he's here
[1:04:17] he will make himself known that he's
[1:04:19] alive he will make himself known that
[1:04:21] he's the god of Pentecost he will make
[1:04:23] himself known in his church that he's
[1:04:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:04:26] and forever but he will never touch you
[1:04:29] until you touch him first that's right
[1:04:32] he will show himself but you've got to
[1:04:34] do it by what faith you got to take him
[1:04:37] at his word he says Moses had an
[1:04:39] understanding that he was to be the
[1:04:41] deliverer from the teaching of his
[1:04:42] mother and he trained himself in
[1:04:44] military might to do so but it failed
[1:04:47] see he had the understanding he had the
[1:04:49] education but that didn't work so he had
[1:04:52] to forget it all and come to the simple
[1:04:55] thing of taking God at his word and then
[1:04:58] he delivered his people the people he
[1:05:00] says yes sir God delivers by what faith
[1:05:03] in his word he always has
[1:05:06] so I want to spend some time this
[1:05:08] evening and we're not going to be long
[1:05:09] tonight but I want us to be able to
[1:05:11] recognize God when he moves because we
[1:05:14] know how he moves amen I want us to be
[1:05:16] able to rejoice when we see God moving
[1:05:19] because we know it's God moving amen and
[1:05:22] so then we can be a part of it rather
[1:05:24] than sitting on the sidelines wondering
[1:05:25] where is God Amen why because we're so
[1:05:27] busy looking over here because that's
[1:05:29] what we expect him to do and not
[1:05:31] realizing that he's right over here
[1:05:32] doing the thing we asked just in a way
[1:05:34] different than what we'd asked same
[1:05:36] effect same outcome but he's doing it
[1:05:39] his way instead of our way and so we're
[1:05:41] looking the wrong way and we completely
[1:05:42] miss the supernatural
[1:05:45] brother Brian says this
[1:05:47] he sends a savior but what does he send
[1:05:49] a savior for then he says I want to drop
[1:05:51] a little something here that'll help you
[1:05:53] there is a predestinated people that's
[1:05:57] going to receive it
[1:05:58] he says that was when he come the first
[1:06:00] time that will be when he comes the
[1:06:02] second time no matter what the church
[1:06:04] got to think about it he doesn't send it
[1:06:06] in vain somebody will receive it he says
[1:06:09] there's somebody going to get it that's
[1:06:11] all it but not the political world or
[1:06:13] the political Church whatever it is but
[1:06:15] when you cry out and God sends it
[1:06:17] somebody's going to receive it that's
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:21] so I pray we receive it if we prayed for
[1:06:23] it let's not pray for it and somebody
[1:06:25] else receive it let's not pray for it
[1:06:27] and somebody else recognize it everyone
[1:06:29] was screaming crying out for delivering
[1:06:32] then Moses come
[1:06:33] and they didn't believe him for the for
[1:06:35] the longest while they prayed for a
[1:06:36] messiah and what they wanted and I
[1:06:39] didn't go in here because of time my
[1:06:41] brother I would say they wanted a
[1:06:42] messiah to deliver them from the Romans
[1:06:44] but that's not what the Messiah was
[1:06:45] supposed to do and so they missed their
[1:06:48] Messiah because it didn't come the way
[1:06:49] they wanted
[1:06:53] he says this you think you ain't got no
[1:06:56] thing coming God has done expressed his
[1:06:59] thoughts you ain't got no right to think
[1:07:01] let the mind that was in Christ be in
[1:07:03] you and he purposed and did the will of
[1:07:06] God he said if I do not the works of God
[1:07:08] then don't believe me see you ain't got
[1:07:10] nothing coming he's the one does the
[1:07:12] thinking let his mind be in you you just
[1:07:15] think the same and that's his word he
[1:07:18] says how are you going to think
[1:07:18] different he's already expressed his
[1:07:21] thoughts to us but we want to do our
[1:07:23] thinking I think they ought to do this
[1:07:26] he says but here's God's thoughts in the
[1:07:28] Bible we ain't got no right to take
[1:07:30] different from that that's God's
[1:07:32] thoughts expressed to us we see and find
[1:07:35] the world falling apart and we're crying
[1:07:37] for something he says let's receive it
[1:07:39] the answer has been given the message
[1:07:41] has been given the spirit is speaking to
[1:07:43] the church he says you're crying out for
[1:07:46] God he was talking about peace
[1:07:48] in this and again for the sake of uh of
[1:07:50] brevity I didn't put it all in there but
[1:07:52] he says everybody's seeking peace and so
[1:07:54] they're looking to politicians and
[1:07:55] they're looking to education and they're
[1:07:57] looking for this and they're looking for
[1:07:59] that he says God's given the answer and
[1:08:01] you're too busy trying to think your way
[1:08:02] through it instead of receiving what God
[1:08:04] has already sent your way
[1:08:07] it's the same thing today we look at it
[1:08:09] I I shopped again today in in dominion
[1:08:12] and the prices keep going up and up and
[1:08:14] up and we say well if we can just get a
[1:08:16] conservative government that'll cut this
[1:08:18] tax and cut this and free a Breezer no
[1:08:21] it's gone to hell in a handbasket
[1:08:22] brother Brown said she's off the skids
[1:08:24] and she ain't coming back it's going
[1:08:26] down and we might have blips of good and
[1:08:28] blips of bad but the trend is always
[1:08:30] down because it's Satan's Eden our
[1:08:33] answer is to get out not to get through
[1:08:35] it it's to get out there's no surviving
[1:08:38] this world in the sense of that
[1:08:40] nothing's coming back amen
[1:08:44] what is it the problem is that when God
[1:08:46] sends his answer people either didn't
[1:08:48] recognize it or they didn't like it I've
[1:08:50] been reading in John and and Jesus is
[1:08:53] there and he does these wonderful
[1:08:54] Miracles and all the priests are doing
[1:08:56] is trying to suppress the information
[1:08:58] that God is in their midst
[1:09:01] out of jealousy
[1:09:03] they were trying to suppress the Messiah
[1:09:06] and then he dies and is resurrected of
[1:09:08] course they don't believe that and then
[1:09:10] the the disciples come and you see them
[1:09:12] in the book of Acts and they're doing
[1:09:13] the very same thing trying to threaten
[1:09:15] trying to suppress the power of God the
[1:09:17] answer of God the gospel that he's given
[1:09:19] the good news because it challenges
[1:09:22] their position it challenges what they
[1:09:23] thought which is he has to involve me
[1:09:27] that was the priest Folly he had to come
[1:09:30] to us he did come to you
[1:09:33] just like he came to everyone else and
[1:09:35] you didn't see him you didn't recognize
[1:09:36] him because you were of a different
[1:09:37] father Jesus said
[1:09:39] but I want to compare our expectations
[1:09:41] to how God does things and we're going
[1:09:43] to go back to Ezekiel 1 here and this is
[1:09:45] a perhaps a strange scripture for this
[1:09:47] but
[1:09:49] I think you'll see where I'm going as we
[1:09:50] get into this a little bit it says and I
[1:09:52] looked and behold a whirlwind came out
[1:09:54] of the North a great cloud and a fire
[1:09:56] unfolding itself brother Brown would say
[1:09:58] when they they did that movie on the Ten
[1:10:00] Commandments he says they got the color
[1:10:01] right and they got the shape it's a fire
[1:10:03] that turns in on itself
[1:10:05] he says and a brightness was about it
[1:10:07] and out of the midst thereof is the
[1:10:09] color of amber out of the midst of the
[1:10:10] fire and this is the Throne of God it's
[1:10:12] The Mercy Seat it's also the Judgment
[1:10:14] seat and also out of the midst thereof
[1:10:16] came the likeness of four living
[1:10:18] creatures and this was their appearance
[1:10:20] they had the likeness of a man and
[1:10:22] everyone had four faces and everyone had
[1:10:24] four wings and their feet were straight
[1:10:27] feet and the soul of their feet was like
[1:10:29] the soul of a cast foot and they
[1:10:30] sparkled like the color of burnished
[1:10:32] brass and they had the hands of a man
[1:10:34] under the wings on their four sides and
[1:10:36] they had four and the four had their
[1:10:38] faces and their wings
[1:10:40] their wings were joined one to another
[1:10:42] they turned up when they went they went
[1:10:44] everyone straight forward as for the
[1:10:47] likeness of their faces they forehead
[1:10:49] the face of a man the face of a lion the
[1:10:52] face on the right side therefore had the
[1:10:55] face of an ox on the left side they four
[1:10:57] also had the face of an eagle
[1:11:00] he says thus were their faces and their
[1:11:02] wings were stretched up where two wings
[1:11:04] of everyone were joined one to another
[1:11:05] and two covered their bodies and they
[1:11:08] went everyone straight forward
[1:11:11] now you've got four different points
[1:11:13] four different sides and he says they
[1:11:15] all went straight forward and that
[1:11:16] doesn't make a lot of sense but we'll
[1:11:17] explain in a minute he says wither the
[1:11:20] spirit was to go they went
[1:11:23] and they turned not when they went so
[1:11:25] this is the key scripture to capture
[1:11:26] here in other words they only went in
[1:11:28] One Direction at any time
[1:11:30] right they weren't operating
[1:11:32] simultaneously but if the eagle was
[1:11:34] leading they went in the direction of
[1:11:35] the eagle if the lion was leading they
[1:11:37] went in the direction of the line if the
[1:11:38] man was lean they went there and if it
[1:11:40] was the ox they went that way but based
[1:11:42] on where the spirit will go
[1:11:45] you have four beasts four anointings
[1:11:48] four powers as we'll get into this and
[1:11:50] they go in One Direction they're not
[1:11:52] fighting they're not contrary one to
[1:11:54] another but they're always working
[1:11:56] together but the leader is the primary
[1:11:59] power or anointing
[1:12:00] okay it says As for the likeness of the
[1:12:03] living creatures their appearance was
[1:12:05] like burning coals of fire and like the
[1:12:07] appearance of lamps and went up and down
[1:12:09] among the living creatures and the fire
[1:12:11] was bright and out of the fire went
[1:12:13] forth lightning and the living creatures
[1:12:15] ran and returned as the appearance of a
[1:12:17] flash of lightning they ran and returned
[1:12:19] oh they're coming and going they're
[1:12:22] doing something and then they're coming
[1:12:23] back they're doing something and coming
[1:12:24] back and it's like this
[1:12:27] one man through there one minute they're
[1:12:28] not and there's a light that happens
[1:12:29] every time they do it now Ezekiel
[1:12:31] doesn't say this is the throne or The
[1:12:33] Mercy Seat but John doesn't it it gives
[1:12:35] us a better understanding perhaps of
[1:12:37] what's going on so if we go in
[1:12:38] Revelation 4 and 6 it says but Before
[1:12:40] the Throne there was a sea of glass like
[1:12:43] under Crystal and in the midst of the
[1:12:45] throne and round about The Throne were
[1:12:46] four beasts full of eyes before and
[1:12:48] behind and the first Beast was like a
[1:12:51] lion the second like a cat the third had
[1:12:53] a face as a man and the fourth Beast was
[1:12:55] like a flying eagle you notice the eagle
[1:12:57] is flying
[1:12:58] it's in action it's moving
[1:13:02] now brother Brown would spend a lot of
[1:13:03] time talking about this and for the sake
[1:13:04] in time I'm going to condense it down
[1:13:06] quickly so we can understand that in the
[1:13:09] Old Testament they had four banners they
[1:13:11] had four tribes that were on either side
[1:13:13] of the Tabernacle the Tabernacle was in
[1:13:16] the center of the camp of Israel when
[1:13:17] they were in the desert and that was
[1:13:19] where the presence of God was that was
[1:13:21] where the word was that was the Shekinah
[1:13:23] Glory that was where the pillar of fire
[1:13:24] and the pillar of cloud hung in the camp
[1:13:27] so God was in the middle and you had
[1:13:29] four standards you had Judah which was
[1:13:31] the lion you had Reuben which was the
[1:13:33] man you had Ephraim which was the ox and
[1:13:35] you had Dam which was the eagle and
[1:13:36] brother Brown would say this he'd say
[1:13:38] now Reuben was the man he was the first
[1:13:40] one the weakest one of the bunch
[1:13:43] now I want to stop here because he
[1:13:45] doesn't say he's weak he says he's the
[1:13:47] weakest
[1:13:49] but don't let you think that's weak
[1:13:50] because it's God's power
[1:13:52] this is a power that guards God and it's
[1:13:54] a power that goes out from God he says
[1:13:56] it's the weakest and he gives us the
[1:13:58] reason why but he doesn't say it's weak
[1:14:00] it's just not as strong as the others
[1:14:02] and we'll see this as we go further into
[1:14:03] it this service and the next
[1:14:05] he says didn't Jacob say so in Genesis
[1:14:07] 49 Reuben Thou Art the first of my
[1:14:10] strength but like water you went up on
[1:14:12] my couch and defiled my couch he said
[1:14:14] live with his father's concubine see
[1:14:16] that's the immorality of the human being
[1:14:18] you see the animal doesn't have
[1:14:20] immorality the lion none of these things
[1:14:22] has that but the man does he runs with
[1:14:24] the next man's wife and so forth he's
[1:14:25] saying the problem with a man anointing
[1:14:28] is that men are easily corrupted
[1:14:30] they can turn to their own lust they can
[1:14:32] turn to their own desires and that's
[1:14:34] what trips them up every time but God
[1:14:36] can use a man anointing God can use a
[1:14:39] man to do things
[1:14:40] but that's not the most powerful
[1:14:42] anointing but it's still one of God's
[1:14:44] anointings one of God's powers
[1:14:46] he says now this down here Dan was an
[1:14:48] eagle and Reuben was the man's face
[1:14:50] ephraims the ox and the that's the way
[1:14:52] they camped in the Bible now if you'll
[1:14:53] notice Dan is the head of three tribes
[1:14:55] Judah is the head of three tribes ruins
[1:14:57] the head of three tribes and Ephraim is
[1:14:59] the head of three tribes three fours is
[1:15:01] twelve it's the Twelve Tribes of Israel
[1:15:02] see each one with their banner and the
[1:15:05] banner of Judah was a lie in the band of
[1:15:07] Reuben man the banner of Ephraim and ox
[1:15:09] and the banner of damn was an eagle
[1:15:11] he says now look back here what John
[1:15:13] said and one had the face let's read
[1:15:15] here now just see if it isn't the same
[1:15:17] thing that was like in heaven it says
[1:15:19] the first Beast was like a lion Judah
[1:15:21] second beast was like a calf that's a
[1:15:23] young Ox third Beast was the face of a
[1:15:25] man and the fourth Beast was a flying
[1:15:26] eagle just exactly the tribes of Israel
[1:15:29] camped around guarding their Earthly
[1:15:31] guards of the right to the ark
[1:15:34] okay so I'm just trying to wrap this up
[1:15:36] quickly brother but I'm saying what
[1:15:37] Ezekiel Saw is the same thing that John
[1:15:39] saw so he says they're connected somehow
[1:15:43] he says oh Hallelujah don't you see it
[1:15:45] hear Mercy The Mercy Seat nothing could
[1:15:48] come anywhere around it without Crossing
[1:15:50] those tribes Crossing what the lion
[1:15:53] crossing the man the intelligence of the
[1:15:56] man crossing the Workhorse as an ox or
[1:15:58] crossing the eagle the swiftness of it
[1:16:00] see the heaven the Earth is between and
[1:16:02] all around you see they were guards and
[1:16:05] above it was the pillar of fire he said
[1:16:07] brother nothing touched that Mercy Seat
[1:16:09] without the approach
[1:16:11] you had to come through one of those
[1:16:12] anointings you had to come through one
[1:16:13] of those guards you had to come through
[1:16:15] one of those Powers now if you read the
[1:16:17] Seven Seals you read the seven Church
[1:16:18] ages you understand that those beasts
[1:16:20] were the literal anointings of God to
[1:16:23] meet the challenge for every age
[1:16:25] okay as Believers as message Believers
[1:16:27] we ought to know that this is the key to
[1:16:29] where we're going today God answered
[1:16:31] Satan's challenge by four different
[1:16:33] anointings by four different powers
[1:16:36] amen and nothing's changed today it's
[1:16:39] the same thing in the Old Testament what
[1:16:40] John What was seen in the Old Testament
[1:16:42] what Ezekiel Saw what the Israelites
[1:16:44] typed out John salm in the New Testament
[1:16:46] so God's been doing this all along
[1:16:49] and we'll see it certainly as we go
[1:16:51] through this how the how that this works
[1:16:52] and brother man would say this he says
[1:16:54] the first one we find out was the lion
[1:16:56] that was the first Beast that went forth
[1:16:58] to meet the challenge of that day
[1:17:02] he says the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:17:04] after him come the next beast and we
[1:17:05] find out the next Beast was an ox which
[1:17:08] is a beast of burden a sacrificed in the
[1:17:11] days of the Roman Cathedral the church
[1:17:12] died out sacrificed the next to come was
[1:17:15] a man was a beast with the face of a man
[1:17:17] and that man was the reformers men's
[1:17:19] education Theology and so forth he says
[1:17:23] and the last Beast was to fly the last
[1:17:25] piece that was to come the Bible said it
[1:17:27] was a flying eagle it says hallelujah
[1:17:29] the prophet said in this day it shall be
[1:17:31] light you'll notice it can be dark on
[1:17:34] Earth but it can be light in the heavens
[1:17:35] and only the eagle can go to where
[1:17:37] there's light in a time of Darkness
[1:17:38] because it can Fly Above the Clouds
[1:17:41] and then it can go where no other bird
[1:17:43] can go but I want you to stop and
[1:17:45] consider this what the prophet's saying
[1:17:46] is you can't uh you can't fight the
[1:17:49] anointing of your age if you want to
[1:17:50] overcome
[1:17:52] you can't say I want to I want to
[1:17:54] overcome this way when God has already
[1:17:56] given a power to overcome
[1:17:57] so the first church age he says was a
[1:18:00] lion and we saw that in the Acts of the
[1:18:02] Apostles they came out with the power of
[1:18:04] a lion and nothing stood before them
[1:18:07] but a transition quickly to a sacrifice
[1:18:09] because they all died they were all
[1:18:11] persecuted and then they were all
[1:18:12] martyred and then the church goes into
[1:18:14] the Dark Ages and they die out and the
[1:18:16] anointing for that day was to die
[1:18:19] and you couldn't say well I'm going to
[1:18:21] take this Bible and I'm going to
[1:18:23] confound them I'm going to show the
[1:18:25] world how silly they are because it
[1:18:27] didn't matter they just laughed at you
[1:18:28] threw you into the pit with lines or
[1:18:30] threw you into the arena with Gladiators
[1:18:32] and they killed you anyways what you
[1:18:34] said wasn't going to change anything
[1:18:35] because that was not God's response
[1:18:37] God's response was that you would lay
[1:18:39] down your life and the thing is they
[1:18:40] were anointed to do it and it got to the
[1:18:42] place where they would willingly give
[1:18:44] their lives you didn't have to take it
[1:18:46] but they would willingly Place their
[1:18:48] heads on The Chopping Block they would
[1:18:49] walk up to be burned they would give
[1:18:51] themselves to the animals they didn't
[1:18:52] fight it because they were anointed to
[1:18:54] respond the way that God had anointed
[1:18:56] them to do it but if you fought that
[1:18:58] anointing or you didn't have that
[1:19:00] anointing you weren't going to overcome
[1:19:01] you'd be screaming and kicking and
[1:19:03] crying the whole time because you
[1:19:04] weren't anointed to give your life
[1:19:07] but now you come to Martin Luther's day
[1:19:09] and Wesley's day and the reformers it
[1:19:11] wasn't time to give your life it was
[1:19:12] time to stand up and use the the truth
[1:19:15] use the intelligence use the logic the
[1:19:17] theology brother Brown would say of the
[1:19:18] scriptures to confound and literally
[1:19:20] this was the that was the weakest power
[1:19:23] he said was the power of man and yet it
[1:19:25] broke the back of the Catholic Church
[1:19:27] why because God was in it
[1:19:29] that's the point is to catch the
[1:19:30] anointing and be under it amen
[1:19:32] so if you fought the anointing you'd
[1:19:34] never get anywhere in that age because
[1:19:35] you were outside of God's way of doing
[1:19:37] things
[1:19:39] brother I would say those four beasts
[1:19:40] they had four faces one had the face
[1:19:42] like a a man the other one had a face
[1:19:44] like an ox Like an Eagle like a lion he
[1:19:47] says they never went backwards they
[1:19:49] couldn't go backwards
[1:19:52] look they could not go backwards because
[1:19:54] every way they went they were going
[1:19:56] forward I probably should have picked
[1:19:58] her up put a picture up here because
[1:19:59] they're all facing outwards from the
[1:20:00] Throne of God any Direction they go us
[1:20:03] forward so you think well the Lion's
[1:20:05] backing up no it's just the bear going
[1:20:06] forward
[1:20:08] or whichever one is on the opposite side
[1:20:10] right they're always going forwards he
[1:20:12] says if they went this way they were
[1:20:13] going like a man if they went this way
[1:20:15] they were going like a line if they went
[1:20:16] this way they were going like an eagle
[1:20:18] they went this way they were going like
[1:20:19] an oxy they couldn't going back be go
[1:20:21] backwards they were going forward all
[1:20:24] the time why because God doesn't back up
[1:20:27] God's answer is always move forward
[1:20:30] you never see God saying call a retreat
[1:20:32] we call a retreat Joshua had to call a
[1:20:34] retreat because they got out of the will
[1:20:36] of God but God's answer is always go
[1:20:38] forward
[1:20:39] it's hold or go forward it's never go
[1:20:42] backward
[1:20:45] God's response is always press the
[1:20:49] battle
[1:20:49] keep going forward he would say this he
[1:20:52] says now the beast in the Bible
[1:20:53] represents power and you notice these
[1:20:56] beasts were not out of Yonder in the
[1:20:57] lake or in the sea somewhere coming up
[1:20:59] but they were at the Throne of God and
[1:21:01] they were worshiping God these four
[1:21:03] beasts means four powers that come up
[1:21:05] out of the earth and those four powers
[1:21:07] were the four gospels Matthew Mark Luke
[1:21:09] and John and he says one doesn't
[1:21:11] contradict one another
[1:21:13] you look at the approach that they're
[1:21:15] they take and and again we won't we
[1:21:17] won't go into it for the sake of time
[1:21:18] but Luke is way different than John
[1:21:21] John's a prophetic eye he sees in a way
[1:21:24] different he starts out in the beginning
[1:21:25] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:21:26] the Word was God Luke's a physician he's
[1:21:28] a teacher he's an intellectual one and
[1:21:30] so he's bringing the facts
[1:21:32] and you see these different ones and
[1:21:33] they're different approaches but he says
[1:21:35] they don't contradict one another
[1:21:37] now catch this he says as the gospel
[1:21:40] Goes Forth like a lion it's Stern and
[1:21:43] it's bold the gospel is brave like a
[1:21:45] lion it's a king like a lion he says if
[1:21:47] it goes never seen movement we're seeing
[1:21:51] something happening it goes towards a
[1:21:52] man's face it's cunning insured like a
[1:21:54] man if it goes the eagle it's got the
[1:21:56] Swift wings and the high heights see
[1:21:58] what I mean if it goes like the ox it's
[1:22:01] the Workhorse that can pull the work Ox
[1:22:03] that can pull the burden of the Gospel
[1:22:05] so he's saying in every aspect it's the
[1:22:07] word moving in power it's God moving in
[1:22:10] power under a specific anointing or
[1:22:12] characteristic
[1:22:15] he says the four beasts was the four
[1:22:17] powers which were Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:22:19] John he says the four gospels that ring
[1:22:22] out in the presence of God so they speak
[1:22:25] and they move
[1:22:26] this is God moving in some form or
[1:22:29] fashion and it's an anointing of his
[1:22:30] choice he says if you notice they had
[1:22:33] eyes in front and in the back everywhere
[1:22:35] it went it reflected they seen
[1:22:36] everywhere they were going he says and
[1:22:38] that's the power of the gospels as it
[1:22:41] goes out
[1:22:43] wow so that means sometimes God's using
[1:22:46] a man anointing sometimes he's using an
[1:22:49] ox anointing sometimes an eagle and
[1:22:50] sometimes
[1:22:51] a lion
[1:22:53] he says it's got the sureness of a man
[1:22:55] it's got the swiftness of an ego it's
[1:22:56] got the power the pulling power the bird
[1:22:58] and bear like an ox it's got the
[1:23:00] sterness and boldness of a lion see it's
[1:23:02] the four gospels which are the four
[1:23:04] powers of the Revelation the fourth
[1:23:06] chapter so these are the powers within
[1:23:08] God's word they're the powers within
[1:23:10] God's Own anointing and they go out from
[1:23:12] the Throne of God to perform the word of
[1:23:15] God
[1:23:16] that's what they do so you've got to
[1:23:18] work within the anointings that are
[1:23:19] there amen our anointing is an eagle
[1:23:21] anointing and that's an anointing to fly
[1:23:24] away
[1:23:25] egos don't stick around to fight
[1:23:28] they would they just take off and they
[1:23:30] head for the heights because they can go
[1:23:31] higher than any other bird notice the
[1:23:33] problems don't cease to exist in the
[1:23:35] eagle anointing
[1:23:37] the problems don't go away the eagle
[1:23:39] goes away problem's still there
[1:23:42] but they've got an anointing that raises
[1:23:43] them up above it amen and we're under
[1:23:45] that anointing because we're in a
[1:23:47] resurrection in a Rapture season it's
[1:23:49] the fly out of here it's to go above our
[1:23:51] problems rather than go through them or
[1:23:53] to die to them or under them
[1:23:56] brother I would say this way he says
[1:23:57] every time a religious power went forth
[1:24:00] to meet the challenge of the political
[1:24:02] power of the world when the lion raised
[1:24:04] up the religious power it went to meet
[1:24:06] the Roman power and then when come the
[1:24:08] sacrifice hour of the ox went because
[1:24:10] he's the sacrifice beast of the Lord
[1:24:12] then comes the reformers down through
[1:24:14] the church Ages come to the face of a
[1:24:16] man and the reformers has been since
[1:24:18] Luther Wesley Calvin on down the
[1:24:20] Pentecostal age but in the last message
[1:24:23] that went forth there came a flying
[1:24:25] eagle he says it's Eagle time reveal
[1:24:27] time the word of God May manifest the
[1:24:30] word of God proved he says o children
[1:24:32] walk into this baptism of the Holy
[1:24:35] Spirit come in and believe it with all
[1:24:37] your heart and God will fill you
[1:24:40] so that's the anointing we're under but
[1:24:43] remember we're speaking about when God
[1:24:45] answers because he sends them out he
[1:24:47] sends out an anointing he sends out a
[1:24:49] power to produce the word
[1:24:52] so God can choose which one he answers
[1:24:54] with in our different lives
[1:24:57] because none of these single anointings
[1:24:59] is the full expression of God's power
[1:25:01] but together combined they express the
[1:25:04] way that God works or the way that God
[1:25:06] has elected to work if I could put it
[1:25:08] that way together they show us how God
[1:25:10] responds to what Satan's doing down here
[1:25:13] on Earth
[1:25:14] if anybody uses them individually as the
[1:25:16] need arises and as he deems the best
[1:25:18] response
[1:25:19] so Brian would say brother Brian would
[1:25:21] say this way he says in Matthew Mark
[1:25:23] Luke and John these gospels are standing
[1:25:25] there guarding and and again I didn't
[1:25:27] put the whole thing in here but he says
[1:25:29] they're guarding the Acts of the
[1:25:30] Apostles they're determining how the
[1:25:33] holy spirit is going to move they're
[1:25:34] guarding the moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:37] remember we read the Scripture it says
[1:25:38] that they moved as the spirit went forth
[1:25:41] so the Holy Spirit moving God moving is
[1:25:44] through one of these channels it says
[1:25:46] the wisdom of a man the power of a lion
[1:25:48] the work of an ox and the swiftness of
[1:25:50] an eagle
[1:25:51] so I've read that at a couple different
[1:25:53] ones there just to to set that and this
[1:25:55] is just before the breach this is in the
[1:25:57] breach between the seven Church ages and
[1:25:58] the Seven Seals and this is right before
[1:26:00] he's about to preach the seals so he's
[1:26:03] preaching this under traditional
[1:26:04] inspiration but now he comes into the
[1:26:07] fifth seal which I'm going to read now
[1:26:08] and remember brother Branham didn't
[1:26:10] preach those under inspiration he wrote
[1:26:12] them because the angel told him what to
[1:26:14] say he didn't have to sit there and
[1:26:16] wonder okay am I catching the thought of
[1:26:17] God the angel came down and brother
[1:26:19] Branham wrote it out line by line word
[1:26:21] by word and he preached directly from
[1:26:23] what the angel told him to say
[1:26:25] because brother Brown said remember he
[1:26:27] said if I he says I'd studied it and I'd
[1:26:29] studied and I'd looked at it all and I
[1:26:31] put it together he says I would have
[1:26:32] preached it wrong
[1:26:35] if I went up with what I had come up
[1:26:36] with
[1:26:37] dead wrong
[1:26:39] but that angel came down and told him
[1:26:41] what every single one of those seals
[1:26:43] meant
[1:26:44] I was talking to brother Kingsley doing
[1:26:45] our Bible study and I was reading the
[1:26:47] the Seven Seals and I I said does this
[1:26:49] mean anything to you
[1:26:51] no I said doesn't mean anything to me
[1:26:53] either without a prophet
[1:26:55] there's nothing in there there's people
[1:26:57] got portions of it but nobody got it all
[1:27:00] and nobody could place it in time and in
[1:27:02] season and then show us where we're
[1:27:03] inside of it as well it took a profit
[1:27:05] and that prophet got it because an angel
[1:27:08] came and stood over his shoulder and
[1:27:11] said this is what it means write it down
[1:27:12] and he told him where to start and he
[1:27:14] told him where to stop
[1:27:16] and he obeyed
[1:27:17] that's why we know the things that we
[1:27:19] know today but look at what he says now
[1:27:21] he's preaching this so the angel told
[1:27:23] him what I'm about to tell you this is
[1:27:25] the highest Authority you can get from a
[1:27:26] Prophet this is thus saith the Lord he
[1:27:29] says we find out in the church ages that
[1:27:31] those four beasts meaning four powers
[1:27:34] was gathered around the acts of the
[1:27:36] Apostle just the way that the Tabernacle
[1:27:38] in the wilderness he says how we drew it
[1:27:40] out here and showed this just exactly
[1:27:41] they were watching over this the lamb
[1:27:44] and the word now what's the purpose of
[1:27:46] these four beasts he says to perform the
[1:27:49] word just as they did the Ark of the
[1:27:51] Covenant in the Holy place in the
[1:27:52] wilderness and so forth so these four
[1:27:55] anointings are God are from God are
[1:27:58] there to perform the word of God
[1:28:01] they're to anoint people there to
[1:28:03] intervene in situations they're the
[1:28:05] counterbalancer the antidote they are
[1:28:07] God's response to what Satan's trying to
[1:28:09] do to kill us to destroy us to mess
[1:28:11] things up so under these four anointings
[1:28:14] if we could look at these way these four
[1:28:15] powers God always brings a response so
[1:28:18] you know what that tells me sometimes
[1:28:20] God comes by the powers of man's Wisdom
[1:28:23] sometimes God's answer is through what
[1:28:25] we would say is a man's Wisdom
[1:28:27] sometimes God Answers by the raw power
[1:28:29] of a lion through the pure power of the
[1:28:32] Supernatural and he overwhelms
[1:28:34] he just destroys whatever's in front of
[1:28:36] him nothing stands in front of a lion
[1:28:39] he's the king of the beasts and so he
[1:28:41] just walks in and he just scatters
[1:28:43] everything
[1:28:45] and sometimes God Answers by way of
[1:28:47] sacrifice and of giving you the power to
[1:28:50] Bear the burden of the Gospel
[1:28:53] and that's just a supernatural
[1:28:56] as the lion anointing
[1:28:58] and then he said sometimes God answers
[1:29:01] Us by just taking us right above the
[1:29:03] situation
[1:29:04] problem doesn't change but he takes us
[1:29:06] to a place where it doesn't matter
[1:29:07] we're literally so secure we're so at re
[1:29:10] at rest so at peace that nothing happens
[1:29:12] and we're just taken to a Heavenly place
[1:29:14] and what happens happens and whether it
[1:29:15] goes the way we want it or not it
[1:29:17] doesn't matter because we're above the
[1:29:18] situation we've got our eyes set on
[1:29:20] something else amen
[1:29:22] but here's the problem we always want
[1:29:24] the raw power of the lion or the FlyAway
[1:29:26] capability of the eagle don't we humanly
[1:29:29] that's what we want we want to either
[1:29:31] Fly Above the situation get away from it
[1:29:33] or we want God to destroy it
[1:29:35] we got want God to just come in and just
[1:29:37] brah
[1:29:39] like the Hulk or Superman just come in
[1:29:41] and and wreck everything and just make
[1:29:43] it go the way that we want to
[1:29:44] but God has four ways of responding not
[1:29:48] the two that we love
[1:29:49] that means sometimes he's going to work
[1:29:51] through a man
[1:29:52] and sometimes he's going to work by
[1:29:53] giving you power to just carry the
[1:29:55] burden
[1:29:58] amen there are anointings their powers
[1:30:01] and no matter the situation the power
[1:30:04] that he gives you will anoint you for
[1:30:06] the situation
[1:30:08] and it's God's choice God's Sovereign
[1:30:10] Choice God's Sovereign will that
[1:30:12] determines how he answers in every
[1:30:14] situation that we face in our life
[1:30:16] and you'll know by the anointing that's
[1:30:17] on you to handle the situation
[1:30:19] there are situations I've had in my life
[1:30:21] and I know it's happened in yours where
[1:30:22] you literally speak the word and it
[1:30:25] happens
[1:30:26] that's a lie in anointing
[1:30:28] there's situations where somebody had a
[1:30:30] conversation with us they're situations
[1:30:32] where medicine has done it
[1:30:34] and that's the word that's the wisdom of
[1:30:37] a man
[1:30:38] and then there's been times where
[1:30:40] nothing changed except that we suddenly
[1:30:42] just Shrugged into the into the braces
[1:30:44] we we we settled into the harness and we
[1:30:47] just kept walking when everybody else
[1:30:49] would have fallen behind us
[1:30:51] and then there's those ones where you
[1:30:53] just get in the presence of God and he
[1:30:55] lifts you up to a point where it doesn't
[1:30:57] matter
[1:30:57] and every one of those is just as
[1:31:00] Supernatural as the other because
[1:31:01] they're an anointing from God to take
[1:31:03] you through the situation
[1:31:05] gonna close with a scripture and then
[1:31:07] just just a bit of a long quote here
[1:31:09] Matthew 6 8 says this for your father
[1:31:12] knoweth what things ye have need of
[1:31:15] before you ask him
[1:31:17] these Powers were here these anointings
[1:31:19] were here before I ever took Breath of
[1:31:20] Life on this Earth before you ever did
[1:31:22] it before your situation never came God
[1:31:25] has already prepared a way to answer a
[1:31:27] way to anoint a way to intervene on our
[1:31:29] behalf
[1:31:30] amen
[1:31:31] listen to these quotes we've got four
[1:31:32] here before we close he says now that's
[1:31:35] the only way I've always found it that I
[1:31:37] can get anything from God is to take him
[1:31:39] at his word
[1:31:41] oh that's wonderful Brother John
[1:31:43] and believe it the way he sends it
[1:31:46] oh that's where we trip up isn't it
[1:31:49] he says now if we do not take it just
[1:31:51] the way that we think it is we've built
[1:31:53] God as an idol he's got to answer just
[1:31:55] according to our ways or well it's just
[1:31:57] no good he didn't answer us God answers
[1:32:00] in many ways he answers in Peculiar ways
[1:32:03] times and everything is odd he says
[1:32:06] we'll take for instance Moses Moses was
[1:32:08] 80 years old he was almost you might
[1:32:11] think too old for God to deal with
[1:32:14] brother Branham led a woman to Christ at
[1:32:17] the age of 92. and he saw her on the
[1:32:19] other side remember when he went beyond
[1:32:21] the curtain of time and she said my
[1:32:22] precious brother says who are you young
[1:32:24] beautiful woman she said I was 92 years
[1:32:27] old when you led me to the Lord
[1:32:29] it's never too late
[1:32:31] until you're gone
[1:32:33] he says he was always you might think
[1:32:34] too old for God to deal with he was an
[1:32:36] old man unexpected in his age to be
[1:32:39] dealt with with God
[1:32:40] another thing he was under Mount Orab an
[1:32:43] unexpected Place God met him at an
[1:32:45] unexpected age at an unexpected place in
[1:32:49] an unexpected way
[1:32:51] God didn't meet Moses the way he usually
[1:32:52] met men he said he met Moses in an
[1:32:55] unusual way in the way that he chose to
[1:32:58] meet Moses in nobody ever had a burning
[1:33:01] bush experience before
[1:33:03] there there is no precedent in scripture
[1:33:05] to say hey if you want to meet God look
[1:33:07] for the burning bush
[1:33:09] no
[1:33:10] God chose how to reveal himself to Moses
[1:33:15] he says that's the way he answers our
[1:33:17] prayer in the way that he thinks is best
[1:33:21] and his way is always right can we say
[1:33:25] that together and his way is always
[1:33:28] right do we believe it God help us to
[1:33:32] believe it his way is always right if we
[1:33:35] ask for anything and it doesn't happen
[1:33:38] just the way we think that God ought to
[1:33:40] let it happen then that makes us lose
[1:33:42] and fall back he says let's ask God
[1:33:44] stand firm on the word say it's true and
[1:33:48] just receive it the way he sends it
[1:33:50] that's the way you've got to believe God
[1:33:52] he says it may come disguised
[1:33:55] it may come in another way around about
[1:33:58] that way he says but no matter what way
[1:34:01] it comes if we have asked we shall
[1:34:04] receive
[1:34:06] that's the anchor that's the resting
[1:34:08] place of the Christian is I have asked
[1:34:10] and he says if you ask you shall receive
[1:34:12] if you knock it'll be opened if you seek
[1:34:15] you'll find so believe that you're going
[1:34:17] to get it
[1:34:18] but don't tell him how to do it
[1:34:21] he says God said so
[1:34:23] that settles it forever
[1:34:25] if God says so now when you get to
[1:34:27] taking God like that and believing now
[1:34:30] Moses what if he said I prayed for God
[1:34:31] to make me a military man and here he is
[1:34:34] in a burning bush it don't make any
[1:34:36] difference how God appeared to him just
[1:34:38] so he appeared
[1:34:39] that's all that matters here as long as
[1:34:42] God comes and answers and as long as we
[1:34:45] recognize it to be God
[1:34:48] amen God bless you let's stand this
[1:34:49] evening
[1:34:51] yeah I'm reminded of that that story and
[1:34:53] I think it's a it may be a Chinese
[1:34:55] Parable I don't know of a of a man and
[1:34:57] an older man and uh
[1:35:00] you know he's he has a son and and uh
[1:35:03] they're out and they managed to catch a
[1:35:05] wild horse a wild stallion and and the
[1:35:08] the the the the village comes up and
[1:35:10] they say oh how wonderful how blessed
[1:35:12] you got a stallion you know a wild horse
[1:35:14] and you know you didn't have to pay any
[1:35:16] money for it and the man said maybe so
[1:35:18] maybe not
[1:35:20] and so a few days later the sun was out
[1:35:22] in the in the Corral and he was or the
[1:35:24] you know in the the area there and he
[1:35:26] was trying to break the stallion he was
[1:35:27] trying to get it to a place where he
[1:35:28] could ride it
[1:35:30] and it threw him off
[1:35:32] and broke his leg
[1:35:33] and all the villagers gathered around
[1:35:35] and said oh what poor luck that's
[1:35:37] horrible and the man said well maybe so
[1:35:39] maybe not
[1:35:41] and then the next week the emperor
[1:35:43] soldiers came through and they were
[1:35:44] conscripting all of the able young men
[1:35:46] to come and fight in the war but because
[1:35:48] the sun had a broken leg
[1:35:51] they didn't take him and all the people
[1:35:52] said well you're so blessed and he said
[1:35:54] maybe so maybe not
[1:35:57] why because we never know what's going
[1:35:59] to happen next we never know what God
[1:36:01] has in store and so we can look at
[1:36:02] things and we can say this ain't what I
[1:36:04] asked for
[1:36:06] or this isn't what I would expect
[1:36:08] but as a child of God we've got Romans 8
[1:36:10] 28 to fall back on that he works
[1:36:12] everything for our good and so whether
[1:36:16] it's going the way we expect it or not
[1:36:17] expected whether it's moving whether
[1:36:19] it's not moving whatever the situation
[1:36:21] is we can say blessed be the name of the
[1:36:23] Lord that's what job said
[1:36:25] Joe was the wealthiest man on the earth
[1:36:27] and when everything went down the gutter
[1:36:29] all job could say the Lord gives the
[1:36:32] Lord takes away blessed be the name of
[1:36:34] the Lord and it says and job did not do
[1:36:37] foolishly he didn't curse God foolishly
[1:36:39] in flare up this isn't what I wanted
[1:36:42] this is what I asked this isn't the way
[1:36:44] I told you to do it God how arrogant we
[1:36:46] can get sometimes without thinking it in
[1:36:48] all sincerity trying to tell God what to
[1:36:51] do
[1:36:52] as opposed to saying Lord here's my need
[1:36:54] I need an answer will you give me the
[1:36:57] answer and when you ask you'll receive
[1:37:00] when you'll seek you'll find and when
[1:37:01] you'll knock he'll open up the door but
[1:37:03] he'll do it in his way amen not ours but
[1:37:05] we're going to take this in the next
[1:37:06] service and we're going to go into some
[1:37:07] examples in the scriptures and and even
[1:37:09] things that brother Brandon would say
[1:37:11] about this so we can understand that
[1:37:13] sometimes we've literally got the very
[1:37:14] blessing the very answer we've been
[1:37:16] looking for and we don't even realize
[1:37:17] that God did it and it was just as
[1:37:19] Supernatural as if he came down from
[1:37:20] heaven and did it in our midst or
[1:37:22] something like that amen let's just pray
[1:37:24] together if we would Heavenly Father
[1:37:28] Lord You're a wonderful God
[1:37:30] Lord and you're wonderful because you
[1:37:32] don't hide these things from us Lord but
[1:37:34] you open your word and you send a
[1:37:36] prophet our way Lord to reveal what
[1:37:37] these scriptures are talking about Lord
[1:37:39] to give us insight into the way that
[1:37:41] heaven works and the kingdom of God
[1:37:42] operates and Lord we want to be a part
[1:37:45] of it Lord we want to be found in it
[1:37:46] Lord not just Lord sitting on the
[1:37:48] outside or wondering or worrying Lord
[1:37:50] but we want to be in the middle of it
[1:37:51] with faith and trust and confidence Lord
[1:37:54] that you're moving
[1:37:55] Lord so I pray you lift our faith Lord
[1:37:57] that you would open our eyes to see how
[1:37:59] you move and when you move Lord that we
[1:38:01] would just be a part of it Lord that we
[1:38:03] would just be so an expectation Lord
[1:38:05] that our joy Lord will be lifted up
[1:38:07] before we even see the answer Lord
[1:38:09] before we even see Lord the problem
[1:38:11] resolved before we see the healing or
[1:38:13] Deliverance or provision Lord that our
[1:38:15] expectation will be that because we're
[1:38:17] asking will get Lord that because we're
[1:38:19] knocking it'll be open and because we're
[1:38:21] seeking Lord we're going to find exactly
[1:38:23] what you have for us Lord help us to to
[1:38:26] be perseverant Lord help us to stick
[1:38:28] with it Lord help us to express that
[1:38:30] trust Lord by prayer and the confession
[1:38:32] of our lips day by day we pray Lord
[1:38:35] would you bless your people now we ask
[1:38:37] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[1:38:40] amen
