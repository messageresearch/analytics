service Lord amen let's thank the Lord for our musicians my haven't they been wonderful Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord so wonderful and what about those song specials mama mama [Applause] Lush I felt like we was back in the old you know brush Harbor Revival days if there would have been 500 people here I think they'd have been clapping and shouting and glorifying God just because we're in a little building don't mean that you know we can't give a little noise because in a few weeks you're going to be in a bigger building so yeah you know amen I'm gonna let you have your seats for a moment well I just read something for you and I put the name of your church up again on this picture do you like that as it's just shining there over the Mountaintop here's a little something that we'll share and I think it goes along with your little church too and the vision of the ministry and each one of you and taking sides with Jesus in Jeffersonville brother Branham said we've got to think of the others that's coming on behind us these young people and so forth and a place for our children and we've got to make arrangements for that and if there is no tomorrow we don't know that if there is no tomorrow we haven't done nothing but been at the Masters business and been found at our post of Duty when he does come now brother John's been raised in the message from the Branham Tabernacle been born around the messages and things in all these years you know the Lord's coming the Lord's coming the Lord's coming and the Lord's coming and the Lord he's coming he's still coming I mean 2022 and he's still coming but as the coffees have gotten older and brother Lush and the different elders and you all have prepared a place and then But as God is moving you forward we've got to think of uh those that are coming on behind us these young people and so forth and make a place for our children and we've got to make arrangements for that and I pray the Lord will bless your Arrangements and bless what God is doing because we don't know if there's going to be a tomorrow that's right we don't know if there might be another three years I mean I'll be honest with you if somebody would have said in the in the 60s or 70s that we were going to hit the year 2000 they probably would have said you're backslidden you know the Lord's coming the Lord's coming I mean 77 80s 90 2000. 2010 2022 I mean they would have shook their head and said no way brother you know we're we're not going to be here and and my parents said they're not going to get married they're not going to have children and they're not going to have grandchildren now they have great grandchildren so friends we we never want to get stuck in our minds we want to stay stuck in the mind of Christ and let's make arrangements for one another and before we read our scripture I'll share this quote with you out of Jeffersonville on the influence of another brother Branham said oh your family's what you are you raise your child in a certain environment it's got a 98 better chance to go right than it has to if you bring it up in the wrong way I put a picture there of some Eagles the adult Eagles and the and the younger Eagles in the nest and brother Branham is quoting this scripture bring up a child in the way that it should go and when it's old it'll not depart from it he said be brought upright teach your children to do right to be honest and to be square and fair even when they're in school now I think 98 is a pretty good percent what do you all think if you raise your children right in a good environment it's got a 98 percent better chance to go right than it has to if you bring it up in the wrong way I believe we're raising up our children in the right way I believe they have a good chance to make it in the rapture come on friends I mean do you all believe that or are we in the wrong church today or we believe in a wrong message are we teaching them wrong things I hope not friends even our singing and our testimonies and our special services like this ought to be where even our younger children or our teenagers or our families that we can go home and say that it touched our daily lives I I don't want to be guilty of just preaching way over people's head I don't think that we need to preach Mysteries the mystery's already been Unleashed amen and I don't want you leaving the church services thinking wow brother John is so deep in the word and then when I say well what was preached you say well um I don't know what was said you know I don't want that we want to get it we want to get it and we want one another to get it and this weekend has been really special and unique and and we felt to speak messages that were close to your hearts on on Friday night we spoke on which son are you of the prodigal son or an elder son and then last night we spoke on I will restore and today I'd like to speak on Christ ministers to the poor Christ ministers to the poor kind of an unusual subject to speak on a Sunday morning but as we're going to see by the word of God I want to encourage you I really want you to feel encouraged and strengthened today it's the number one thing that Christ said and we're going to read it here if you want to turn to Luke Chapter 4. it's the number one thing that identifies the ministry of Jesus Christ was he came to preach the gospel to the poor and you're going to find that in brother branham's life also how he was a poor man and poor in the ministry and and the people that surrounded brother branham's Ministry wasn't rich and famous people a lot of them were poor and down and outers and cots and stretchers Jesus his he was born in a poor family his mother when she came to bring offerings on his um dedication day brought turtle doves and if you look in the Book of Leviticus that's actually an offering of a poor family they didn't even couldn't even afford a lamb and and if he couldn't afford a lamb when bring turtle doves so Jesus Joseph and Mary were not rich people y'all are a little quiet that means you're listening right well it's a real trademark of Believers then you don't have to Aspire to be rich or famous or you don't have to Aspire your number one goal in life shouldn't just be to attend a big university or college or you know to live in a big house or drive a fancy car we're here to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness so maybe the Lord just asked brother John to speak a simple message to maybe encourage someone in your daily life that'll just take away some of that strain and I want to say today and you'll pick it up throughout the the service I don't want you to get a complex in your life that you are poor I don't want you to be embarrassed or ever ashamed that you're poor I don't want you to be embarrassed or hang your head as a Christian as a message believer or a carrier complex that you're never good enough or we've got to be a certain standard or we got to do a certain thing I've been called today from the west coast to the east coast to just talk to you like that and the way I'm going to deliver the word is even very important I want you to feel real settled when you leave here today that okay I might not have everything that the world might have or what I might have but I have the Lord I have spiritual things and by the end of the service as brother coffee let us let let the poor say I am rich [Music] that ought to be our confession we're not poor we're not down and outers we're not kicking a rock down the road and never gonna make it nowhere no no we're going in a rapture so let's stand and turn to this very familiar scripture that I know your ministers have read many times Faithfully Luke chapter 4. and it's been so an honor to speak to you and you've made us feel right at home and met all our needs and I just pray the Lord would just come through his word now and just minister to your heart Luke chapter 4 we find in verse 14 Jesus returning back to the place where he was born in Nazareth and he returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out of Fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read so Jesus believed in going to church and there was delivered unto him the book A Certain book a certain Prophet messenger that was for his day a certain book was given to Jesus of the prophet isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written why did he go to this verse why was it so important why is the very first thing when he says in verse 18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me did he just run around the temple did he just grab a hanky and wave it and start screaming and yelling no the very first thing that he did when the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he he began to speak he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor amen it's the number one thing have you ever even thought of that before the number one thing that he said when he was anointed was I don't want the poor people to feel like you're forgotten that's that's quite amazing I want you to ponder this today this is this is pretty incredible this is the Lord Jesus being anointed to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted that's what our sister sang about about the remedy is Jesus Christ to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord that's pretty incredible did he take up a rod and start beating the people did he start yelling at them when he was anointed when the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Jesus did he all start finding all their faults and all their weaknesses and is that what he did I want you to notice his approach was as I've come to minister to the poor and he closed the book verse 20. and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son it's amazing how you can be in a supernatural atmosphere and people's minds are already so carnal I mean you know isn't he Joseph's son I mean oh the preacher has glasses oh look at his tie that he's wearing today look at his hair or you know how did he come out did he hold his Bible like the prophet and they're so carnal today but the bride has their mind on the word they're they're they're seeing the spiritual projection of what's being said and how it's being said there must be a message throughout this weekend that the Lord is trying to convey to you of where we're at in the message and what the ministry that's anointed by God is actually saying to the people we need to take note of that and we need to be obedient to that and say Lord we've entered into another season now and I received that God bless you as you have your seats today Christ ministers to the poor we all know that Christ means the anointed one so what will the anointed one do when he comes around what will the anointed word for our day not just the written word but the Living Word what will it do when it's around God's people he'll be anointed and what will he what is one of his first things that he said will come from that anointing is that he's come to minister to preach to the poor I just think that's incredible let's go to another scripture if you will and that's Matthew chapter 5. it's very close to Luke there back to Matthew is everyone doing okay today did you get a little rest last night and a little breakfast who ate a little food this morning breakfast and maybe you're fasting that's fine too but amen we got a little strength today so we can make it it's lunch time I think already I got the pulpit turned to me almost at lunch time so can we do we have a little time for the word [Music] I think this is going to help someone I think in the next few minutes some of you are going to be helped in your spiritual life that's what we seek to do when we come is not to elevate ourselves or something but so that the people can leave and they feel like they got a hold of something Matthew Chapter 5 is another scripture of the Beatitudes I want you to notice again the emphasis in Matthew chapter 5. when he Jesus seeing the multitudes and he went up into a mountain and when he was said his disciples came unto him and when he opened his mouth and taught them what was the number one thing that came out of his mouth I think from these two scriptures we can really take a lesson about what's really important then and the whole Beatitudes if you look down through verse 12 all the way 1 to 12 here this is called the Beatitudes of The Sermon on the Mount but verse 3 when he ought opened his mouth and taught them saying bless it are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven Amen in two places of the Bible we see now in Matthew 5 and we read out of Luke our opening scripture verse 4 we find an emphasis being put on the poor blessed are the poor in spirit you know poor as we go forward this morning is not always poor in finances some of you might not have heard this quite like this before because right away your mind would go to the poor as being poor in finances even though many of God's people are poor but I want you to think about this as Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are the poor maybe in gifts when you think of your life and think of maybe your talents you might feel like you're poor you're blessed today Christ is going to minister to you today when you feel like as a sister or as a brother maybe you're poor in health maybe you struggle with your health and you you have poor health and you think like maybe you're getting in a certain time of your life and and you're poor in health like you don't you can't contribute or you can't be the kind of mother that you'd like to be or the kind of sister or the brother in the church Christ is going to minister to you today maybe you're a person that is poor in friendships maybe you don't have a lot of friends maybe you feel alone a lot of times or like make maybe like a misfit maybe you came from Africa or another country and you've came to North America Canada and you feel like you're just trying to make it and you to survive here in this culture and you feel like you're poor maybe in relationships or friendships Christ ministers to the poor maybe you today feel poor in strength I know that we had a Friday night service and a Saturday night service and maybe on a Sunday afternoon now it's in the afternoon but you maybe feel poor in strength I want to I want to say this today Christ ministers to the poor maybe in physical abilities you're maybe when they chose the team you were always one of the last maybe when it comes to being physically abilities and to run or to jump maybe you weren't always the best maybe you're not in the top class and you feel poor and your physical abilities maybe mentally have you ever thought about this that's the number one thing that Jesus said that he's come to minister to the poor that it's just not always finances but it could have been a person that was poor mentally mentally they're not strong they might be physically strong maybe they have money in the bank but mentally they they are not strong brother John traveling now over the world and preaching in a lot of places I found that really amongst Believers that there's a a real test of our mental strength and sisters and brothers it's a it's a it's a very age of a mental battles that we're going through how many remember brother brownham in his meetings there would be stretchers and Wheelchairs and they would just be all kinds of uh things in his meetings and he would go right down the line in in discernment and say oh you sister back there you've got heart trouble and the man next to you you've got a kidney disease and and the neck next oh and you behind you there in the corner and you just thought my goodness these are serious needs and today if I would go through the building it probably wouldn't be like that oh brother you have cancer or you know you've got a tumor or you've got a lung disease it probably wouldn't be that way I can say that probably uh without even knowing you but it would probably be what are you going through sister what are you going through brother well there's a mental strain there's a struggle that I'm going through I'm facing this in my life our financial strain and the mental ability to make the grades or to kind of fit in it would be more of a mental condition and we look like everything's in order and there's no wheelchairs here there's no stretchers where everybody's doing just fine but really if you want to look into the spiritual Dimension that many people have become poor and I want to say Christ ministers to the poor maybe poor in education maybe poor and and having DNA or hereditary or the gene pool that follows in your family you actually might be poor you might struggle in that DNA area maybe poor and musical talent I don't think this church suffers with that very much but you know there are places where there is a musical Talent where you just don't have it you know and uh well you're a little quiet there but you know some Churches we go to they they struggle and they fight and they just you know they don't have a lot of talents I think the Lord's really blessed you but sometimes you wonder it's like Lord I can't preach I can't sing I can't hardly do nothing I feel like a failure I feel like I'm struggling poor an ability to keep things together and maybe you know I I want to reinforce this that Jesus was born in a poor family if you want to look in the scripture you don't need to turn now but and Matthew Mark and in the Gospel of John Jesus told this to the disciples the poor you have with you always the poor you have with you always even evening Light Fellowship the poor you will have with you always we we can't always meet all the needs of all the families and all the needs the church is not a bank evening Light Fellowship is not a financial institution this is a Church of the Living God and so you know we try to meet one another's needs and we try to respect the poor and be mindful and have compassion and and I believe that's important as we are a body but we can't meet all the needs of everyone sometimes people get into financial trouble sometimes there are decisions that are being made by young couples or young people or even older ones and we just need the Lord to help us stay humble and go forward in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Luke chapter 4 that we read if you'd like to turn back to there just for a moment I'll go back to it with you on the screen when Jesus was speaking when the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he was anointed to preach the gospel to the poor there was always a lot of poor people around around Jesus maybe they were dressed tattered maybe they were broken when you find Jesus who he talked to like the woman at the well or talked to the man that was at the pool of Bethesda it wasn't always people that had nice clothes and in the fineries and their Chariot drove up you know and they had 12 horses and who got out Jesus was really dealing with people that was in trouble A lot of times if you look in Luke chapter 4 speaks about the poor he speaks about the Brokenhearted speaks about the captives speaks about those that were blind or those that were bruised and how the ministry should follow that projection and I as we're going to talk about in a few minutes the ministry of William Branham followed the same projection wherever Christ is these attributes are going to be in the ministry can we say Amen and that is in the bride Ministry also should be our emphasis that it should be that the gospel is being ministered to the poor and I'm going to say this again because it's in my notes don't get a complex about being poor if you are in one of those lists of people that I just mentioned about poor and friends or poor and strength or poor and mental ability or poor and musical Talent or maybe poor fans financially don't get a complex and drag your head around you are a son and a daughter of God do you know today you can be rich in wealth and poor in spirit you could be rich and worldly wisdom have all kinds of degrees and diplomas on your wall and be smart be educated you know almost know the answer before the teacher even gives the question you can be rich in that and yet poor and love and poor and brotherly kindness I'm speaking this way today to maybe adjust some of our perceptions because we are living in exactly what brother John is preaching today is going opposite than the world we live in so this isn't popular you're not going to win any popular contests by believing this kind of message or preaching this kind of word it's not a running around the building and shouting Hallelujah to recognize that we are poor and sometimes we begin to look at our services and what really is the most important things that we need to be speaking about it's the things that the people are going through in their day-to-day life is that true you could be rich in finances and in mental abilities and be sharp and yet be poor in compassion and poor in Grace and poor in Mercy and the believer ought not to be that way we ought to be rich in compassion we ought to be like that Samaritan that was hated by the Jews the Jews were raised to hate the Samaritans they're like dogs and they're not even part of our race but remember Jesus gave that example of the priest that was too busy the levite that was too busy but there was a man that was hated by the Jews that had compassion on this man that had been beaten by the thieves do you all remember that and this man was backsliding so he was not in a Revival he was going from Jerusalem to Jericho and brother Branham said did you notice he was backsliding yes that's right so this this man did not look on him like the priest and the levite and say I don't have time all serves him right and he's backslidden he's going you know just you know anyway no he he knelt down and had compassion and poured in oil and wine could I ask you how you're doing this morning this afternoon and that I mean do you have that kind of a heart or do you have a heart of Grace are you quick to forgive how many know that in birth pains when brother Branham took birth pains and took the scripture and his Pages were stuck together and and you remember him fumbling around because he thought there's a misprint in my Bible and his wife is embarrassed he had just got uh this Bible for Christmas gift he had looked up the scripture you know that he had with his old Bible but he had brought his new Bible and he said it's the the pages are stuck together and he's embarrassed yes sir and who was it that stepped up in front with him was a Catholic priest Bishop Stanley and gave him his Bible and he actually prophesied and called brother Branham brother he called him brother and brother and he prophesied over brother Branham and brother Branham said that in the next Service uh this day the scripture is fulfilled he spoke it two times there the next night and then went back to Jeffersonville and spoke a whole message on this day this scripture is fulfilled in other words did you notice yeah when Jesus Took the scripture in the Bible that his very first thing was I've come to minister to the poor here's a Catholic priest and all his robes and everything Hammond brother Branham his Bible and brother Branham and the message called him brother Stanley brother brother John I would never call a Catholic priest a brother where your Prophet did yeah yeah your Prophet called him my brother just like Abraham called lot brother lot and brother and brother you read that in the Book of Genesis you say well I would never call that brother that had backslid or that sister that was in Sodom I would never call them a sister brother I would say they're a backslidden person well your Prophet called them a brother and he called a leader of the Catholic Church the Church brother Stanley oh you say brother we would never brother Brandon was such a gentleman wasn't he would never speak bad about anyone yeah well where are you at in your life what's your attitude to our people do other people say that about you or or you got a religious little cloak on you and your little call I would never do that call a lot of brother blessed God you know what happened to his wife she turned into a pillar of salt and he got drunk later and all these kind of well the Bible says brother lot foreign I think I better move along amen stay with our thought amen I'm just asking you where are you and your love where are you in your conversation what's the conversation like around your table with your children you know you could be rich today in recognition you could be popular and have all kinds of likes you know thumbs up on your Instagram Facebook and on you're so you just might have all kinds of people thinking you're just fantastic and you are so wonderful and oh I recognize this person you could be rich like that and be poor in relationships poor and being able to connect I'm gonna bring up an example in a few minutes of Marilyn Monroe and how she was raised and and how she becomes so popular in a sex symbol globally and brother Branham talked about her life and how she was so weary and when he saw her and heard about her life how he saw a whole nother side of Marilyn Monroe and they and he said the world would say she committed suicide but brother Branham said she died of a heart attack how many know that to be true and I'm going to show you her image and I'm going to show you her background to say that she started out poor she started out as a in a foster home an orphanage and she went on to become very popular and very rich recognized around the world even today and sometimes as Believers we can say well I'm not recognized and I'm not well known in fact I'm looked down but yet you're rich in relationships and what God has given you you are at church today Hallelujah I mean everybody with their cars and I know your parking lot's small and things but if you were so embarrassed that you didn't even have a car and you just kind of shuffled out last and said God bless you brother I'll see you at the fellowship at four o'clock you know but and you Shuffle down to the bus to the bus route or in a bicycle and you get there instead of having your nice dress all nice and how you doing brother coffee congratulations brother Legend sister unless you you got dirt all on the back of your skirt you know you didn't have much to bring to the potluck because to be honest with you you couldn't afford it I mean that kind of shows another side of who the gospel came is to preach to those kind of people you know you could be let me just finish that thought you could and say well I'm a person that would get on the bus this afternoon or ride their bicycle to the to the great celebration is actually greater in the sight of God and they ought to be revered in their in our church as a real popular person more than those that are on social media are out there in politics or it's throwing a touchdown pass to Dan and thousands are screaming in their stands and they're just so wonderful and they're just so fantastic did you see that cat and all tomorrow and Tuesday they'll be doing all the replays and everything and you know what that that quarterback is divorcing from his wife and that quarterback you know this cornerback just had adultery the last do you know all the tattoos and all the earrings they take off their helmets and they got studded diamonds here and and they're abusing women and they're abusing this and and they pay them off because they got millions that is not wonderful that is not rich today we need to focus down on what God has put around us and say that's rich and we are rich to have that kind of song that kind of preaching that kind of piano player though this kind of church it's not how high the steeple is it's how big your heart is it's how you do them through the week and election worldly possessions and have cars and and and lands and stocks and bonds you could have all kinds of boats and and things and guns and shoes my you could have books and iPhones and and Android devices and tablets and Microsoft my goodness brother John lives around Seattle where is the it's the very you know capital of Microsoft and Amazon oh Bill Gates and Jim bezo Bozo whatever his name is and we find out they can't even keep their marriages together that's right amen they can't even keep their marriages together they're they're not happy they're the secretary this or the million dollar Island I mean what is their yacht gonna do when a tsunami comes and just crashes up we begin to find out that people could be rich in all of these things and yet poor in Christ pour in the word and poor in peace what is real riches then this afternoon what is to be rich what is life all about I want you to listen real closely today maybe a service like this could change the trajectory of a person's whole life I'm very aware that a service like this could change the direction of somebody's life some decision that they're making or something that they put out there I'm very aware that after three services like we've heard that it could change the course of a young lady or a young man for the rest of their life they say that children are like wet cement whatever's put on them whatever is impressed upon them is what they become so we need to be careful about how we are with our children and our families and make arrangements for them what is life all about then what is money what is popularity what is pleasure if it ends up being in a wrong relationship then what is pleasure what is houses I'm speaking about Christ ministering to the poor and I'm trying to show you the negative and the positive then what is real lands and what is being famous what does all that mean I think today that we would rather be rich in Jesus Christ I would rather be rich in his word I would rather be rich in his promises I would rather be rich in love I would rather be rich in goodness I would rather be rich in forgiveness if someone would find fault with my life I would really love that they would say but he just gave too much grace he was really rich in forgiveness for others and for himself I want to be rich in peace I pray that for your families I pray that for your children I pray that for your wives and your husbands that I uh that you would be rich in peace I really do friends that you would find richness and joy and surround yourself in positive things somebody say praise the Lord he ministers to the poor Jesus ministers to the poor I know this is unusual Isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 and 2. thus saith the Lord the heaven is my Throne Earth is my can I go on a little bit Earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all these things hath my mind handmade and all those things have been saith the Lord but to this man will I look to this woman this Sunday afternoon am I looking who's I looking to even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my work [Music] I want to be where the Lord's uh attention is he didn't say to rich people to people that gave the most tithing or offering or were the best dressed no I'm gonna be looking to those individuals that are poor they're contrite David they respect my word they actually tremble that God would even speak to us like that and would say those type of things through one visiting Minister then another visiting Minister and another Minister that don't even know us surely the Lord must have a theme or must get something across to us but I wonder sometimes are we really catching what the spirit is saying to the church and then are we being obedient to follow those things blessed are you today if you're poor blessed are you that have a contrite spirit blessed are you that are trembling at the word Matthew 5 we read it already blessed are the poor in spirit so we're looking at a much deeper meaning than poor is not just financially or money or values and dollars or cents and things but poor is a man or a woman sometimes that might even be a person that that is needy has their hands out say now I want more of you Jesus I want more of you their destitute of wealth sometimes they they don't have a lot of influence maybe on the you know the placard on them they don't have a placard but it's not you know president or vice president they're not prime minister king or queen they're helpless how bloodies ever felt helpless before about half of you like well you're in good company you know let me just stop right here and say something it's Tuesday in America there was elections in the United States and they voted for senators they voted for Governors they voted for House of Representatives they voted for different initiatives and about things on ballots and things but you know what it really revealed it revealed a country that is very divided amen locally and even throughout the nation it actually revealed that America is a very divided country I know we're not politics and we're not thinking that way but I'm showing you on a political and on a national level I think it's that way in Canada too how you can be looking at the exact same thing and have totally opposite views in fact in the polling it was like 51 to 49 it was like 51 of 50.6 and 49.3 this person was 50.6 and this is 49 that's not being balanced it's not like 70 percent in 30 say man it was a landslide I mean literally throughout the whole nation you had races like that where they are so divided and in opposition and their struggles and opposite opinions I tell your friends the answer is not in politics the answer is not in politics it is not the liberals or conservatives or The Independents it is in Jesus Christ I I think we ought to have those ladies stand up and sing that song again amen we have a remedy and his name is Jesus Christ well if you were political Justin Trudeau or this other person and it's like are you serious you're so divided you look at the same piece of paper and say two opposite things people look in the message and they see two opposite things you can have churches and ministers and people they'll read the same quote and the same Bible and you wonder that's not even the character of our prophet our Prophet didn't handle the people that way that's not the spirit of the message and I'm trying to convey this this morning and in so many ways from here and there in illustrations and local things and and things from out of my experience or testimonies or quotes from Brother Bradham or the scriptures to let you know that Christ ministers to the poor where you're lacking he wants to make up the difference maybe in respects to your spirit you maybe even in learning maybe an intellectual culture in schools and things you just seem to fall short I'm just being cautious with my words but I want to be mindful to the Lord Jesus because we have different ones that move from other countries to North America and they think that oh the American dream or the Canadian plan it's so good it's so wonderful and they start out humble and they start out sincere and they want what's good for their children and what what's good for their families and if they're not careful down the road they got two jobs and then three jobs and they want to drive the Tesla or the BMW and they want to have the American dream or live in the nice house or you know have a you know the fancy newest iPhone and they want to do this and and it's a false facade because we that live here know that's not really contentment I mean we know that our culture is not the Canadian dream or the American dream it's only in Jesus Christ but I've seen so many then run after education because they want a better life for their children than that what they had or they want a better house than they can really afford or they have in their mind some great big idea and we find after years that go by they're not really happy and their children aren't happy and their marriages aren't happy they can actually get Warped in their whole lives because they've had something before them that was not real amen it's better to be poor and have a walk with Jesus than to be rich and not know him you can know a lot about him and not know him depart from me ye that work iniquity I never knew you that those were people that was involved with church things and casting out devils and preaching and all kinds of good works and things I mean the Rich Young Ruler was not a bad young person he he came to Jesus he respected Jesus and when he said all these things from my youth have I done Jesus never disputed that he was a good young man in the message he he would have been kind of a model young man in our church that was raised around the church very respectful if it was a young lady she you know she tried to live and hold the standard I know she was a little bit of you know lip gloss and a little bit of you know maybe excess over here music kind of you know there was a time but you know she's we're glad she's here and all of that but then as time goes on their hearts go away from the Lord then we wonder was we really focusing on the main thing did are we keeping the 98 as our standard you keep them in a good environment you keep them around have a balanced Ministry have a balanced home life and they're gonna make it then it really really ought to strike us like our dear sister I was sharing with you last night that put those pictures all over her house and notes on the refrigerator and and microwave in their bedrooms on the mirror she got under a burden that her young people would be going in a certain way and I I'm here to tell you friends if you're on that road thank you on The Fast Track going down the road and thinking you're passing everybody and you're just better than everybody and you've got to have this and maybe the Lord's just putting a little bit of check in your heart today he's not going to ask you what was your degree crossing over to that other side what kind of car did you drive uh what kind of model did you drive and all we're gonna have the higher class in this section and over in heaven then we're going to have this those that struggled and the poor people down kind of here in the ghettos there is no there there's no get out in heaven it's a wonderful place I'm going to be in a place with you as streets of gold and a city we don't deserve to be there but he said you're worthy to be there he's making you worthy to be there I'm preaching this with a lot of earnestness I've got to be there my wife's got to be there my husband's got we've got to get dead Earnest today we didn't come here for an offering we come here for yourselves I don't even know you people my my lovely family but I'm more concerned about you are Tuesday what you're going to be thinking and what's your home life like than I am right now I'm more concerned this week about how you're caring about your love life with the Lord how you're treating your your spouse how you're treating your children are we really emphasizing the main thing help me Preach Today we ought to think of this great consideration then we ought to take the scripture and say why did he say that was the number one thing that I'm preaching the gospel to the poor we ought to take that as valid as something very valid in the Beatitudes when he said blessed are the poor the number one beatitude because we all was poor I have a very great um warning in my heart to speak to the older generation we can forget that when we started out we were poor too and I know God would bless you with the good things and and you can dress better now and you can have a better house and have the ability to to move things around and buy certain things or you know you can have that now but we don't never forget I hope this is okay don't never forget where you came from don't never forget that some of you maybe struggled financially or even in your marriage when you were first married and it it wasn't always clicking stop putting that romance fairy tale story in front of our young people that everything's good all the time that's nothing but what they're reading and looking on the internet as romance and it's not true marriage is struggle good Holy Ghost people struggle in their marriages I'm gonna smile I'm looking at you I've been married for 30 years and I know what I'm talking about good brothers and good sisters have to learn to change and adapt and it's not always his way it's not always her way it's not your way or the highway and you gotta walk around like eggshells around her in the morning you know and that's not the spirit of Christ some of us drink coffee better than we do the Holy Ghost well don't talk to me don't even talk to her until she gets her coffee you better not make any major decisions till you've had your vintage we glorify caffeine more than we do the power of God I'm being serious some of the little things that we have learned to become our habits we need to really look at because our children are going to accentuate that times 10. and our weaknesses they're picking up on that and sometimes we spank can we might want to delete this off the YouTube or you correct your children you correct your children and really what you're so upset at is you see yourself in them because you used to be that way you don't disrespect me you don't tell me you don't put a temper tant well that's the way you used to be that's just your own self coming out you're trying to beat out that old nature and you can't do that with a rod foreign stay with your notes okay I'm back here stay focused I did feel to say that today older ones let's not forget that we also went through hard times sometimes even bankruptcy sometimes failure sometimes you made bad decisions and wrong things and you just gotta admit it amen maybe having two jobs and three jobs you can't pay off that debt you just got to be honest and say listen baby listen baby we need to go back to being simple again where's our prayer life where's our time in the word we haven't even gone out for a date for three and a half years do I even know you I'm serious that and you're running here and she's running there and he's running over here and the kids are over there that's not a family that's not the mold that's not our goals that's not our pattern listen friends we can be poor and have our struggles but rich people have struggles too hello Tom Brady is a fantastic quarterback but his wife just said that's enough he wanted to retire and and that's it and she wanted a family man and all the time she's going along with her Jitsu partner there and anyway and he wants another year and nothing you look what happened in the year they got money coming out their ears both of them it's not being married to a Brazilian model that's going to keep you together oh y'all are getting quiet but I'm talking to you amen I'm talking some of your language you know exactly what I'm talking about amen and right on Sundays yeah he's throwing beautiful passes and he's doing all kinds of and he doesn't even know how to be a father and how to be a husband yet he's got the money brother he must be blessed really so you might be today in a position of being poor emotionally you might even be a spiritual person but emotionally or mentally you could be poor today you could literally be poor you could have enough money to go out and buy lunch at a restaurant today and yet emotionally not have it you just don't have it I could give so many and if I had another service to take on that what we know on the back end even in the message of things and prominent people but they struggle in this area of mental and oppression and even pastors wives and ministers and people that are prominent in the church deacons and things you're not alone sister when you feel nervous and it's like your only Escape is when you close the door to the washroom like give me some privacy you don't even hardly have enough time to take a bath I mean you can't even go to the restroom with them things going under the door in people's head and you're like oh God you're poor poor Christ ministers to the poor I mean he's gonna pick up and bring a minister from the West to come and talk to you and say God's got this you're not a weirdo you're not about to crack up you're normal you're a normal believer that's going through what we're all going through and he's ministering to you right right there at your point of need that's real Ministry it's ministering to the people at their point of need God give us people that are contrite they've been smitten and stricken in their spirit it's like brother John my courage is gone my emotions are gone the reason that I don't have it to give I don't have the love I should and the kind of patience is because I've lost it somewhere in the battle and I see it on my disposition I see the very seat of my emotions it's been like the carpets ripped out underneath me Brother John and I need courage and I need Spirit look in Isaiah 66 verse 2 those are the ones that the Lord Jesus is looking at praise God that you administer like this not to the strong people in the church that the service isn't for you then today just exit it often say that's where brother so and so or sister so but maybe it's for you to realize we're a body and we need to have this kind of Ministry for one another I'm willing to stand here so that my sister can be ministered to amen I'm willing to be a servant so that my brother can really be ministered to I want him to catch this I don't want her to feel like because she is feeling like that way that she's not a good Christian and she don't have the Holy Spirit I want to be able to let the Holy Spirit minister to her do you know in Matthew 5 when Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit that word blessed actually means satisfied and happy or happier are the poor in spirit do you know that it's actually poor people that will receive the Gospel read more readily and easier than someone that has a lot of money know that the gospel is carried on the shoulders of the poor and any pastor and any trustee will tell you that it's not always the big givers in the church it is uh it is those brothers and sisters that give their offerings and ties a lot of rich people are stingy and give the least [Music] and I don't even know your names let alone your Ledger here I'm just telling you from experience a lot of rich people don't give they have some weird concept that all these write-offs take away their income it's very weird it's a worldly lack of Revelation that all these write-offs kind of take away their income so they might be millionaires in the church and you have a brother that's struggling and he's given his 200 or a hundred dollars or I have little children that give a dollar sometimes or 58 cents and I'm just so thankful and you have a millionaire in the church and they're not giving where did that come from amen praise God the Bible says Happy happy are you when you're poor I meant to say this earlier don't be a poor person and be sad and miserable and you're still going to be poor all right when the people that are rich and have all the they're not happy either so why are you trying to be like them come on why are you thinking all the time I've got to be a certain thing and people that are that certain thing they're not happy either because they want to be another thing come on I tell you this is a deep revelation the Poor People's gotta get it stop trying to be like them when they're them and they're not happy either [Music] because they got one yacht and they want a bigger yacht you know they got a million dollars and they went three million and their taxes are worth more than you ever even think about your mortgage and you know one-third problems blessed are the poor there was a king are we doing okay this is our you can kick me out after this service amen there was a king in Scotland King five of Scotland you can look it up that on occasion he was a king he would lay aside the Royal Robes of being a king and he would dress like a peasant and in that disguise he would move freely about the land making friends and entering into their difficulties appreciating their handicaps and sympathizing with them in their sorrow would when he was a king and sat on the throne then after going through that with the peasants and the common people he was better able to rule over them because now he had a fatherly compassion and he had mercy in fact there was one day a good King loved his people very much and he dedicated his life to serving his people but he had a hard time understanding exactly what they were going through because he was a king so he was born in a royal family so he always knew that he would become a king he but he never had to cut wood with the wood Chopper he never had to work in the fields like a farmer and it was hard for him to understand what it was like to be a regular person in the kingdom are you listening so one day this King decided to make himself to become a peasant so he laid down his crown he would give up all his powers so he could work like the workers in the field and struggle through life like those who lived in his kingdom so one day the king told his guards and his noble men today you see me for your last time for many years oh and they said good team why do you say that they ask are you going to a foreign country the king replied no I'm going out amongst my subjects I'm going to become like a peasant his guards are noblemen they were amazed why would the king become a peasant why would he care what others have to go through we He will always be king so what does it matter to him how other people are living it was hard for them to understand but the king's mind was made up so the good King he left the castle and lived in Disguise Among The Peasants so he could understand them better the king so loved his people that he wanted to understand their needs and wishes so he became one of them I hope you're thinking spiritual that's exactly what God did for us changed himself from being Jehovah God to became one of us Jesus Christ he was tempted like us suffered like us he died like us he didn't have to go through that but he was God I want to say that's my God I can serve that kind of a God I I can be like that kind of a priest that would would actually become like one of us and and suffer with a headache and he would be sick and tormented he was a teenager he was a young person he was a person in their 20s somebody say praise the Lord so that now when you pray to him he knows what you're going through and he's not just striking you up because he was tired he sweated too he was misunderstood I mean come on Friends you've heard enough messages on the cross what he went through he didn't have a nice little robe and a little long he was stripped naked on the cross hello somebody's here evening time evening Light Fellowship how would you like to be stripped naked in front of all the people and yeah hanging up there that's embarrassing amen isn't it and you had done nothing but good healed their sick raised their dad been kind and generous compassionate loving all of that and they still killed him let me just put this as a little note for everyone you can be just like what you're praying to be to be like Jesus and people still will hate you they still will look down on you they'll look down me oh no oh she's just being religious so just wake up today and realize it's not about everybody's opinion [Music] the church thinks about you you don't know what they're going through and you don't know why their young little boy is like that or their little girl you don't know why that why that brother is carrying himself in a certain way why he's not responding to to a service maybe he's going through a distress maybe tomorrow Tuesday morning he's filing for bankruptcy around and the Bible says you're worse than an Infidel if you kept around he just feels like do I even have the Holy Ghost and what do I say to my teenager now that we got to move out of our house and well here's a good message for you to hear Christ is trying to minister to you when your friends walk out when they say bad things on the media about you and when they put thumbs down instead of thumbs up what are you supposed to do about that I'm poor brother John I don't even have a person that understands me my husband don't even understand my wife I could never tell her I'd be too embarrassed to tell her where we're at and what we're doing people in the church they just friends we can get such an attitude look at Second Corinthians chapter eight are we still doing okay blessed are the poor Paul said for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he become poor that ye through his poverty might be rich somebody say praise the Lord [Music] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ though she was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich he became poor like a beggar I mean can you imagine being married man feeding the Messiah changing his diaper telling him to go to bed you need to go to bed you know it's you need to go to bed that's the Messiah he was still a little boy he still needed his diapers changed none of us are Catholics but we still got the little Halo and oh he was just so perfect and all of these things he was a young man there's a years of Silence from 12 years old to 30. we don't know a lot that went on but he was a teenager and if you're a sister with the Life of Christ and you're going through life you're still going to have the times of the month and you're still going to have menopause with the Holy Ghost it's going to come in all our churches all of our sisters are going to deal with this you can get quiet and look at me all weird and your face get all red but it's nothing but the truth and brother Bynum didn't call him demons and Devils he would just say you're going through that time of the month and you get nervous and it comes at that time of the evening and they talked about certain times of the year I think we're in that time of the year where it gets gloomy and it gets darker early you need to be careful oh you say I got the Holy Ghost brother well we I do too but brother Brown I'm in discernment when he would talk about these things Crossing Bridges before you get there that's real people are already crossing the bridge going around the corner and doing something and she said and he said and I just know that they're poor mentally but God's trying to strengthen you today he's trying to let you know that you don't you're not filled with the demon Spirit he's trying to encourage you and Minister he became like a beggar Paul was talking about and is poverty and his lack of riches he he that we would become rich that we would have spiritual blessings and a giving of an abundance of this praise the Lord let me just go to another area talking about brother branham's Ministry I need to turn a little corner here to build this thought for you are we still doing okay brother branham's Ministry was surrounded by these kind of people he's talking about it in in British Columbia Dawson Creek some time ago I was going into the psychopathic room from the auditorium to pray for the people some of them in straight jackets well who's your congregation well I've got the auditorium that's full of stretchers and cots and things that for and over there is a psychopathic room and there's people in there that are in straight jackets who knows what a straight jacket is straight jacket that's his congregation they were poor couldn't even hold it together I'm bringing this to you for a reason how many you've heard of Charles Fuller the old-fashioned Revival hour well that's where it was Long Beach we just left there a few days ago and when the big Auditorium and oh my what a meeting we had and he's talking about brother Fuller there calls him brother Fuller when we were there a wonderful Christian brother he was going out that afternoon and he as he passed off the platform now he's showing the contrast brother Fuller and his group his crowd when they went out fine dressed and intellectual people he made an altar call and one lady raised up her hand that she wanted to receive Christ wonderful dedicated a few babies and went out a Grand Old Saint in Charles Fuller man nice cars and intellectual what a service they had say I want to be part of that group well let me talk to you about the messenger our messenger and I noticed his group going out that afternoon and our group hello group our group waited out on the peers and so forth to his service was the Smith and here come my crowd in Hallelujah wheelchairs crutches straight jackets that's a lot different when you can stand and kind of talk some kind of a theology nothing against Dr Fuller a godly man but to stand and tell them about Christ that lives and will save them and let them raise their hands and put their name on a book that's one thing but when your faith has to Buck against Wheelchairs and crutches and blind and deaf and dumb and insane and screaming and whiskers over their face he's talking about the poor people [Music] now which church do you want to join today what kind of group do you want to be a part of well I want to be part of a good brother John that has a ma did you see how that sister held that microphone and she would just say oh man she just held it so good and what do you want a sister that's broken and contrite can't even hold a tune in a bucket but she knows the Lord Jesus she's at least she's standing up there singing a special we got so many critics in the church you know and you know that that would never get up there to sing it they got all kinds of judgments about everybody else did you see her shoes did you see her dress oh my I see oh my just well who are you why don't you get up there and sing a song oh No but I could never do well you're sitting in the seat of a scornful nothing's ever right in the church you know you've heard all this too hot too cold there he goes again here we go again well why don't you get on the Lord's Side where there's Victory and joy and instead of being in the scorny and say my other must be a reason why the Lord's talking like this yeah he's ministering to the poor I'm collecting some of your boys that they would have fell asleep a long time ago they've been awake for a whole hour or more some of your young people though they're lost after 30 minutes in another meeting I've seen them sit for an hour hour and a half two hours they're locked in they they'll never forget that service oh yeah who comes to our church well we got wheelchairs brother watch liquor could you please help that brother in now we got brother sharp 70 years old today right is that right is that his birthday today let's all say happy birthday comes brother you know he's helping a blind person into the church dang they're actually throughout the service there's not enough a lot of amens and glory to God there's a lot of grown people just talking nonsense well that's out of order brother coffee get them stop them brother back there they're ah they're in pain deaf and dumb and people probably going to the bathroom in there because they can't even control themselves they're dumb and insane streaming whiskers all over their face that was brother branham's group blessed are the poor Christ ministers to the poor then it's not always intellectual then is it it's not always being able to put it all together in a nice little bow package Hallelujah brother that brother you just he turns his notes over and you know it's 30 minutes is it we're about coming down now brother we're gonna get out of here before one o'clock glory to God I've known of message churches we're their best the the congregation just love those Brothers they preached 35 40 minutes they were the Fantastic ones and they just love those ministers and they marry somebody that's not their wife and I didn't even know if they're in the message today you see our human Natures we tend to appeal to the easiest Road or what can be easy when brother branham's group was insane people he just gotten insane and and the same the paragraph before he went to a psychopathic room and if you read that quote he was dealing with a young lady and dealing with their situation and some of you know the story he would go into another place down underneath and it's like why are you in here and and she was so beautiful it looked like she had it together yet her mind was gone how many remember John the Baptist how many know one of the main things that Jesus said to John the Baptist disciples because remember John the Baptist is in prison who knows some of the main things Jesus said you go tell John that this is the ministry what was it what did Jesus focus on what did he say okay you Brothers go back and tell John what did he say was it how he held the Bible was that how he just talked about the Mysteries and the Seven Seals and did you notice how he wrapped that all up in the rainbows and oh did he say that no he said in Matthew the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel praise to them Hallelujah there's all kinds of things happening the supernatural but don't forget to tell John that the poor people are and I'm sure John went okay you're the you're the blindness the deaf this and that and then the poor have their gospel preaching John said Hallelujah [Music] it would be like this yes okay I see the Supernatural and then oh and finally the poor is having the gospel preach to them I can see it already brother Jonathan brother John the Baptist going yes yes cause I know if he would have told me it was all the rich people all the Pharisees while everybody's receipt oh my they pull up the church and they got six you know camels and they got 12 Arabians and they're all just sitting up there so Papa's oh John would have said oh man real really I'm dramatizing but that's exactly right it's a scripture in Luke Jesus answering said unto them go your way tell John what things you have seen and heard how the blind sea the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised and son's going yeah yeah and to the poor the gospel is preached it's like yeah you're about ready to have your head cut off yes the car are being ministered too Hallelujah somebody say praise the Lord in Newfoundland today we have the gospel being preached to us this has happened that's happened and that's happened with how you really know the the poor people are being ministered to praise be to God as we try to find a rep find a place to wrap these things up today this is Marilyn Monroe I have her you can look it up and study how many she was married three times she only lived a very short life but when brother Branham talked about her and show us the father notice the title show us the father he was talking about how the lord gave are we still doing okay I need to let you know that what I said earlier was in the message I saw a vision of this young woman dying that they said that committed suicide it's been about a year ago I forget this she was some kind of a girl that was very popular woman I was up in the mountain and I saw her die and they told me he said he told me he said you can say it's four o'clock it's just a few seconds before four I think that's incredible and said they'll say she committed suicide but she died with a heart attack and you can go and search it out today on the internet they'll say she died of suicide reaching for the phone with all pills on the on the table next to her the night table and she just died she committed suicide and brother Bynum said she did not commit suicide she died with a heart attack what is her woman's name a young blonde-headed woman Marilyn Monroe that was it she died and she did not commit suicide watch in verse paragraph 155. I felt sorry for the girl are we all listening she always seemed to be kind of a woman weary like she needed something I wish I could have got to that child she needed Christ she might have went to some cold formal Church but she needed a real case of Salvation with something in her heart to give that assurance her father look at this and show us the father he's he's showing how this young lady her father she never seen him her mother was in the insane Institution it was all on the girl's mind she needed Christ and then in that he's talking about a young lady are you with me today she's raised in a foster home she it's just horrible it was all in the girl's mind her mother was in an insane Institution can you imagine her mother spinning the wall don't even know your father your mother's insane she needed Christ it was all on her mind here is Marilyn Monroe here you can see cause of death what the world would say barbiturate overdose where she was born Los Angeles she was an actress a model a singer she was married three times look she was married the year she was married and then divorced even the the paper when she died Marilyn Monroe killed cell found in bed hand on the phone took 40 pills this is what the papers said about her death Marilyn Monroe she was born to the certain woman she was an American actress a singer a model she was famous for being a blondie bombshell and her characters won a popular sex symbol in the 50s and 60s as they went through that sexual Revolution she grossed it talks about her movies which was equivalent to two billion dollars in 2021 long after her death she still remains in pop culture and things a major icon and goes through all of these things born in Los Angeles she spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and she married at age 16. working in a factory during World War II and she met a photographer she was looking for love in all the wrong places she she didn't know her daddy her mom's beating her head against an insane institution War she goes from foster home Foster Home Orphanage and that's when brother Branham he talked about her and that she committed suicide and said she needed Christ she he felt sorry for her he seemed to be kind of a woman kind of weary like she needed something I wished I could have got to the child she might have been in so some cold formal Church she really needed a real case of Salvation with something in her heart you say brother John you repeated that yeah we need it to be repeated sometime because I don't know if we got it the first time she was poor yet she turned out rich she's popular she's all kinds of all over the internet today for all the wrong reasons so what do you want to be like today I would say Lord Keep Us near The Cross who was her father Marilyn Monroe who they don't even know till today who her father was I tell you we ought to be thankful we have a Heavenly Father this was expressed through John in third John 1 and 2-4 what says I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children Walk In Truth this was an apostle of love saying that he had no Greater Joy than to find the Lord Has No Greater Joy than to see us walking in the truth and neither does his ministry or your pastor or the Elders of this church There's No Greater Joy than to see us going on with God and that we made arrangements and we can see some are catching it and some are going on sure they all have their struggles and sure things aren't maybe the way that you would like them to be or maybe they would they're not the way that you would do them but there is no Greater Joy that we should have this afternoon than we are in the presence of God Hallelujah Lord help us to be as Earnest as we should be about these things maybe somebody's turning a corner maybe somebody is at that point of just making a decision and God predestinated this weekend long before we even knew you were going to sell this building long before we knew you were gonna buy another building and this was our last special no we didn't plan it that way is that true brother sister God planned it that way God loves you today God loves us David even was unashamed to say in Psalms in verse 6 Psalms 34 Verse 6 this poor man cried and the Lord heard him so it's not always in our times of strength but it's in our times when we feel like we're poor I'm Afflicted Lord I'm needy I'm weak I'm lonely but I'm crying out to you Lord how long is this going to end when is this going to end for the message Believers or are we all going to become rich and well-off and able to make it well I have three scriptures for you to read here Matthew 26 Jesus said you have the poor always with you in Mark 14 you have the poor with you always and John chapter 12 verse 8 the poor always ye have with you it's incredible you're going to have them to the end God considers the poor yeah I you know I can read these things and Psalms 37 verse 25 I have seen the young and now I'm old but yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread today right now we need to stop confessing we are so poor I need to turn this corner and we're on the home stretch stop confessing you're so poor stop building your little mournful little tent always that you're so poor when really you are very rich look around you today at the people that love you look around at what God's blessed you with you you're better off friends than a lot of people that are in the message in China or in Africa this morning I got all kinds of pictures from Brother Barry coffee from Malawi and Tanzania and from and from Ukraine and and testimonies about can you imagine having a family and living your whole life and fleeing a country your nice house your nice little field your nice little Cabbage Patch or whatever and you just got out of there with the clothes on your back that's right that's what our Believers in Ukraine are going through hello somebody oh well we've we've worked for All These Years brother John yeah it's just being bombed and burned [Music] and you're just blessed to get out of here alive you know look over at somebody and say we got out of here a lot alive and somebody somebody's having to give you a t-shirt or give you a Bible or something we ought to say praise the Lord for if you're going back to a house or an apartment or even under the bridge here locally you ought to say praise God I'm alive we're serving the lord God bless all of you for being such a responsive audience Christ ministers to the poor he's not ashamed to stand up in front of them and say I'm here to get under your burden to take my burden upon you my yoke is easy and my burden is light I understand what you're going through and I'm here to breathe life into you to breathe a breath of inspiration into your sales so that you can get up and keep on serving him and loving him and you say wow brother John it's kind of amazing what you're talking about today you know all the things and I have so much more that I could speak on but was Jesus born in a rich family he was born in a manger Angels appeared to lowly Shepherds that's who receives the message are Shepherds his mother brought him the lowest offering to dedicate a turtle doves did he live in a palace did Jesus have a private jet did Jesus have servants I'm trying to get some of you off your little Ash heap of always woe was me and I've got it so bad if you're just bear with me a couple more minutes what about your prophet what about William Branham was he born into a rich family did he go to a popular famous School did he have a lot of clothes I understand going to school that he had to you know didn't even hardly have shoes sometimes I understand that he didn't even have a shirt do you all know what I'm talking about and they had him in this you know Schoolhouse and they put him right next to the furnace because he was so he didn't even have a show don't you want to take off your coat Billy aren't you warm no ma'am I'm just kind of a little kind of chilly in reality he didn't even have a shirt on talk about embarrassing did he have a church where there was thousands of seats just thousands my brother John brother branham's Tabernacle just had thousands and balconies and five Services a day because there were just thousands are you serious I was born and raised and there wasn't thousands of people that came to the pratham Tabernacle did he travel on private jets did he minister to poor people was his ministry of healing into the Brokenhearted did he preach deliverance and and heal those that were blind did he liberate those that were bruised and I would say that is the ministry of Jesus Christ then what about the ministry of Christ today in the bride don't you think that it would carry the same projection if Christ is going to be in you will it not bring forth The Same Spirit of Christ how many want him to walk in you today how many want him to talk in you how many would want your nature to be like Jesus to be like Jesus I want to act like him she is him his spirit is in you so then if it's the same projection then there's got to be a people that's begin to recognize that our whole mission in life is to be like Jesus our whole achievement in life is to be like Jesus our mission statement ought to be I want to be like Jesus our goal is to be like Jesus and do you know what that spirit of God did when he came on Jesus I mean the spirit of the Lord when he sat down he was anointed to relate to poor people to needy people to troubled people that's where healing flowed I tell you friends love is going to win the elect the law will not win at your new church there the law is not going to win when they walk in and y'all are measuring how high their skirts are or this person's so stinky they must have just walked and they haven't taken a bath for how long well neither did John the Baptist [Music] y'all want to talk about some Financial portfolios what about John the Baptist Financial portfolio you think it was very good come on everybody what do y'all what do you all think about Paul and his uh tax return for the years he was in prison we can get quiet but I'm talking reality I've been in prison for two years wow what do you think he said to his wife about their income these are real people I've talked to you about Mary Joseph Paul John the Baptist well I got three locusts to my name and I just ate two of them for breakfast and I'm looking forward to them for I'm gonna eat a locust for supper that's my portfolio where do you live I live in a cave who's your friends I got a bunny rabbit that comes in the morning I got a big moose that walks in the evening man I'm not gonna take him out one day my goodness you got a real circle of friendship well that is the greatest man that walked on the face of the Earth he was smelly maybe not brushed his teeth maybe we need to be a little bit more careful about how we judge one another then maybe we need to look at about matters of the heart instead of how they hold themselves maybe that sister has a little body odor because she's been carrying a baby throughout service or she has two little children she wasn't able to curl her hair this morning because she stayed up half the night with somebody that was screaming and snotty amen just maybe maybe they could use a little encouragement come to the house of God you say well brother I think our church is built upon helping all the strong people all the people that's got it together well really I think the church ought to be built upon helping those that are needy doing what we can for others and not really caring what everybody else thinks that as time goes on you find out they're not really friends anyway seek first the kingdom of God today what are you becoming what are you becoming today but sometimes we need a good kick in the pants if you're a brother and you need a good kick in the pants but we don't like you well you need a good kick in the pants amen you need you can do better for that lady you married her you made the three children or the one children or whatever let's serve the Lord I'd rather cry and weep in the house of God and look strange to the world but yet know the Lord Jesus then be out here in some stadium with my shirt ripped off and going crazy for somebody running around out there that don't even know me and and you're just whatever well we won today you didn't win nothing it's we well our team that we like you're that's nonsense that's gonna fade away just like their football and now it's World Cup and all kinds of balls and things it's just gonna fade away friends are your physique and all your good looks and everything and I'm closing up all my notes Hallelujah we want to be good Christians Christ ministers to poor let's let's go out of here and say God I want to be rich in faith and rich in love and rich in goodness I'd like to hear the choir come back and sing how many would like that today okay we're gonna have the choir come and singing sing a blessing I just thought that was so fantastic Hallelujah this is what makes us live our lives as the Holy Spirit comes down and anoints the word and we can say Lord may my attitude be right may my focus be right your universities are gonna burn you're all kinds of your money's gonna burn your car is going to burn your houses are gonna burn but give us Jesus God bless you I love you today as brother coffee says let's stand and change our position just for a moment and then we're going to have the choir come can the choir sing again brother Hallelujah I think that'll be better than a you know a sandwich we're gonna have this afternoon or something drink somewhere some vintage Grande you know it's a give me a good dose of the Holy Ghost amen give me give me something that'll give me strength for the journey I need that Lord fill my cup Lord give us happy people heavenly father I pray your anointing on this church Lord if any person is poor or feel weary that you would strengthen them today God we meant the sermon to be for every single believer that they would feel encouraged and be happy let them feel inspired today Lord forgive us if we've looked down our nose at one another had a bad attitude maybe we didn't know all the facts behind the case maybe if we really knew what that brother was going through we would want to help him we want to do something maybe that sister's about ready to break maybe her mind's going on a thousand different directions and she needs some oil she needs some wine she doesn't need to be spoken against she doesn't need to be thrown under the bus oh God let us be more sensitive Lord and have compassion one for the other make us a compassionate Church make us a church that ministers to the poor to the needy and to those that need help Lord God in Jesus name I pray a blessing on every person Lord may they feel stronger now than as we go from one another's presence I Love You Lord who would like to lift up your hand and say I love you Lord I Thank You Jesus I appreciate you Lord thank you for your mercy thank you for your grace thank you for loving me when I was poor when I was Outcast when I didn't have no friends when I was needy and now you've given us so much Lord we are rich Lord rich in your love rich in your presence Lord rich in your message Lord don't let us be like Leo to see you that says I'm rich in all these things and they're naked and blind and miserable don't let us become miserable Lord don't let us be sitting right in a message church and dying twice Lord worse than just Dodie and somebody wants to put their weight up on us and we just fall all apart help us to have courage to give to one another and strength to give to one another and come on Lord Jesus come on Brothers come on sisters and lead by example not squirt a little water over here let's try this and let's try that no let's

worshiped and praised so we just want to make sure that we use that gift right right or he'll get somebody else on it you know he'll get somebody else but by grace by Grace we're using the talent that

the request came in yesterday and I was trying to find a place to to put it because you're trying to find a mind of the Lord when you're developing the song service and I I could not fit it in last night and and I redid the song service this morning twice but last night and this morning and couldn't find a place to put the song I wanted to you know I knew we were going to sing it but we're you

is [Applause] amen God bless you just have your seats for a moment if you would it's a military service up down up down and but I wanted to before service I was just reading there and and reading where the the brother said not Brother John the brother said he said we're like the scripture says the man that looks in the mirror and then he goes away and he forgets what he looked like and he said what happens when you come into an anointed service is you get to look in the mirror of God's word and see yourself as he sees you under the anointing is when you find out who and what you truly truly are and if you believe that an anointed Minister has been standing here then it has been God showing us in a mirror of his word what we look like to him and so he said the problem he says is that we are in an anointed service he says but as soon as we leave the anointed service we forget what we look like that moment in what the very presence of God and he says we've got to make sure that we don't forget what the word was telling us we were in that service he said because he said otherwise we're supposed to be writing a book of Acts he says and we end up writing The Chronicles of laodicea because what we are rich we are increased with Goods we have need of nothing we are not poor we don't have needs anymore but when the word is going forth and you're in the spotlight of the Holy Spirit you sit there and you say that's me that's me but you leave the service and then you say maybe I'm not quite the way it said and you forget because we are forgetful hearers amen so I want to encourage you this morning I'm going to cover a couple things that jumped out at me just by way of reminder because there was a theme this weekend there are a couple major themes in there amen but we don't want to walk out and say I forget what he said don't take brother John this brother John we got so many brother John's here don't take my word for it go back this week and listen to every single service again when you don't have to go out and watch your kids and you're not angry because your son is crunching in the people's ears in front of you and you've got this going on that going on go back and listen take it and listen and say Lord what was your word what was the mirror showing me that I was this weekend brother John started the first thing he said and he warned us he encouraged us he said restore a spirit that calls us to ask for another chance for those that are causing issues or falling away Emma the second thing he said is if Satan is trying to get in at such a young age so is the holy spirit let us be pressing in to the Holy Spirit as much as it's trying to press into us he said Don't Fear The Wrath of the father Embrace his forgiveness make things right remember he told the story about how he had told that lie to his dad and he held it for so long and his dad when he finally told him said why didn't you tell me before yes it was no big deal it was no big deal I'm your father what am I going to kick you out because you took no come quickly and make it right he said our response to Restoration should always be rejoicing and praise not anger and skepticism he said are we getting the people to church are we getting people to Christ and he said both sons needed restoration both were arrogant proud and Headstrong and in the end he said good works don't cover bad behavior I thought that was the most poignant thing that it was a an amazing statement good works don't cover bad behavior then he preached I will restore and he said a word from God will turn your heart not your head I was reading there the brother was saying that Satan is in a psychological warfare with us and we get up into head games but he says God turns the heart and then the heart from out of there comes the faith to turn your mind into that which is of Christ amen he said Jesus Christ is the solution to every issue and problem that we have he said restore means a covenant of peace to be complete and sound to be finished uninjured to make safe and whole to compensate to make good to reward and repay and to make an end of your current condition he said Spirits travel on Words watch what you say this was the biggest thing in my mind that he said last night he said in the time of your wounding the holy spirit is released in that situation becomes character in your life he says sometimes it takes a jolt a shock to get our attention and turn us towards God sometimes we're so caught up in what caused the shock rather than saying is it turning me toward the father amen and then he said restoration takes time healing takes time he says you have to be willing to have patience with God with yourself and with others he says we want a drive-through restoration that was amazing don't we just want that one service in the presence of the Lord and I won't ever have to worry again listen he works in time sometimes there are Miracles and we've seen him in everybody's life here we've had a miracle I guarantee you but more often he works through time and it is a restoration process not a restoration moment and he finished with sheep are dumb that's why the Lord has to be our Shepherd and then today he started with the acceptable year you know what the acceptable year is is when the anointed message comes forth that's the acceptable year because many people read Isaiah before that but when the anointed message comes that is the acceptable year that is the time of the Lord's choosing for you to enjoy the benefits that he's written he said where are you in your conversation and where is your brotherly love you know so often he talked about we're poor but he says to him that is of a poor and a contrite spirit a repentant Spirit an unworthy Spirit sometimes that's what it takes to get anywhere with God is we have to see ourselves as poor that's the laodiceem problem they can never see themselves in need amen we've got to see ourselves in that place he was talking about the the Rich Young Ruler and Jesus said one thing thou lacquest yes we all have one thing we lack and God's going to put his finger right on the thing that we value most and say give it up will you give it up will you give up your money will you give up your popularity your influence your good looks your career opportunities whatever it might be like the young man that wanted to play football will you give it up for me because I'll use you in a way that nobody else could ever use you amen he said how hard is it for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God why because you think you have everything yeah he said how hard is it for a rich believer to enter the kingdom of God that thinks I have need of nothing and then the first thing God had to do to ever use me was humble me had to Humble me and say you're nothing you are nothing yes unless I'm using you but listen you say I am rich they said how can how can it even get into the kingdom of God he said With God all things are possible amen amen it said he became poor that us through his poverty could have his riches amen poor means you can't get out of your current condition yourself amen how many times are we in that

can you stand up and say it nothing thank you he spoke into my life can you say he spoke into your life this morning that is what the Holy Spirit does it is so perfect and it is on time and it is specific and it is personal that's the kind of God I want to serve because he said he only comes once to the unbeliever he only comes once to the unbeliever but to his child he comes again and again and again and sometimes he's got to get you where the pigs are sometimes you just take one foot out that door and he touches you and you say whoops I'll turn back father amen we have been blessed we have seen the supernatural in our midst this weekend amen he has spoken to me I know he has spoken to many of you I've seen you responding in the sources in your worship and your praise crying reaching out to God and God is there to meet the needs that we have and he has come in and he has spoken to us this evening in this these these last few days brother John God bless you for for for following the leadership of the holy spirit amen can we thank brother John for his goodness and coming out amen and let's all stand together if we would I'll say one thing nothing encourages a

through a man you go let that man know you aren't Off the Mark you tell him brother you spoke into my life you said things that I know you couldn't have known and it was the Lord that was dealing with me go encourage him in that he's got a long flight back he's going home and his wife won't even be there he's gonna need some encouragement he's going to be right back in the saddle he'll probably be
