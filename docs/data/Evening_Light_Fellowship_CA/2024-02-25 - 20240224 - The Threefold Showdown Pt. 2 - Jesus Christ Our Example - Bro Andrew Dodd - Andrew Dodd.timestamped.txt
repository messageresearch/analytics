[51:47] together to the Book of Luke Luke
[51:50] Chapter 2 amen it's good to see every
[51:53] one of you here I thank you brother Josh
[51:55] for the song service tonight I
[51:57] appreciate that the special sister
[51:58] Priscilla God bless you I love the way
[52:01] the Lord moves don't you amen I love it
[52:04] just a simple humble song and just an
[52:07] atmosphere that comes in behind it amen
[52:09] he's worthy of all our praise he's
[52:12] worthy of all our worship he's got
[52:13] angels that worship Him holy holy holy
[52:17] is the Lord God Almighty constantly day
[52:19] and night before his throne and there is
[52:21] no night there they just worship and
[52:23] worship but there's something about the
[52:25] redeemed when the bride of Christ
[52:28] becomes gathering in and we come
[52:30] together and bring our licks of fire
[52:32] when we begin to sing a song that Angels
[52:35] cannot sing Amazing Grace how sweet the
[52:38] sound when we begin to sing of how he
[52:40] redeemed Us and how he brought us
[52:42] through our trials when we begin to
[52:44] thank him for that Angels don't know
[52:46] what that's like they have to be quiet
[52:48] in our presence when we begin to sing
[52:51] God puts you in a place CU he loves you
[52:55] amen he died on the cross for you the
[52:59] Bible says he with joy he endured the
[53:01] suffering for the joy that was set
[53:04] before him he willingly endured the
[53:05] cross amen let's take our Bibles here to
[53:08] Luke Chapter 2 I want to carry on
[53:10] tonight into The three-fold Showdown but
[53:13] I would take for a subtitle tonight
[53:15] Christ our
[53:16] example Christ our example in Luke
[53:19] chapter
[53:20] 2 verse
[53:22] 49 amen we certainly enjoyed the
[53:26] brother's breakfast this morning that
[53:28] all that could make it I asked brother
[53:29] Jensen on the way to church did you
[53:31] enjoy it he said yes so we enjoyed the
[53:35] the brother's breakfast thank you for
[53:36] the fellowship each one God bless you
[53:39] richly amen lukee chapter 2:
[53:43] 49 and he said unto them how is it that
[53:46] you sought me wish you not that I must
[53:50] be about my father's business and they
[53:53] understood not that saying that he spoke
[53:56] unto them and he went down with them and
[53:59] came to
[54:00] Nazareth and was subject unto them but
[54:04] his mother kept these sayings in her
[54:07] heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[54:12] stature and in favor with God and man
[54:17] amen may the Lord is Blessing to the
[54:19] word you may have your
[54:21] seats amen as I said we're still
[54:24] speaking tonight on the on The
[54:25] three-fold Showdown and the first
[54:27] Showdown that we went into last night
[54:29] was Mount Carmel and and and how that
[54:32] every believer needs to come to a Mount
[54:34] Carmel in their life in order to
[54:36] understand and have a revelation that
[54:38] God is God God is Sovereign God is able
[54:40] to do whatever he will God is will
[54:43] perform his purpose he will perform what
[54:46] he desires to do what he has laid out
[54:48] before the foundation of the world to do
[54:50] the question is are you a part of it
[54:53] amen are you willing to say the Lord he
[54:54] is is God Amen it outlines so well in
[54:58] that Showdown the pressures around it
[54:59] leading up to each Showdown but God
[55:02] proves himself in every dispensation
[55:04] because a showdown is to prove who God
[55:07] is in that dispensation and he proves
[55:09] himself in every dispensation of his
[55:12] three-fold purpose of just who he is and
[55:15] how he's showing himself and what his
[55:17] Veil is and he proved that day on the
[55:19] mountain of Mount Carmel that God is God
[55:22] and now tonight if we could come into
[55:24] the second Showdown brother Bram would
[55:25] talk about and pick up your pen and
[55:27] write being three showdowns of Mount
[55:29] Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration and
[55:31] Mount Zion tonight as we could go into
[55:34] Mount Zion or Mount Transfiguration a
[55:36] little bit and look at Christ our
[55:38] example we begin to get a pristine look
[55:41] into the life of the Son of God leading
[55:43] up to that Showdown which was not a
[55:45] public
[55:46] show this one was not the first one was
[55:49] showing that he's God and that that that
[55:52] nothing is greater than he is but now in
[55:54] this second Showdown as he begin to come
[55:57] to prove who he is in that dispensation
[56:00] it became a private Showdown where he
[56:02] had three Heavenly Witnesses and three
[56:04] Earthly Witnesses and that was all he
[56:07] did it before and God does not take
[56:09] these things lightly God does not do
[56:12] these things just to do them amen God
[56:14] does not move in our midst just to move
[56:16] in our midst we ought never to come to
[56:18] church and God move and say well wasn't
[56:19] that nice no God when he moves it's
[56:22] always for a purpose he's got a reason
[56:25] behind him coming into our midst amen
[56:28] God uh doesn't do anything new he knew
[56:31] everything he's omniscient he knows all
[56:33] things he knew that you would be here he
[56:35] knew that God would bring you here he
[56:37] knew where you would sit brother man
[56:38] would talk about how he knows every hair
[56:40] that's on your head he knows the length
[56:42] of your fingernails he knows exactly
[56:45] where you're at he knows your thoughts
[56:47] he knows the intents of your heart he
[56:49] understands exactly what you're going
[56:51] through he knows the trials he knows
[56:52] what you went through today to get here
[56:55] so let's leave that in the past now and
[56:57] let's focus on what he has for us
[56:59] tonight because God knows all about that
[57:01] and he's able to take care of it amen
[57:04] and the first dispensation of his of his
[57:06] three-fold purpose was to prove that God
[57:08] is God and now in the mount
[57:10] Transfiguration it was to prove that
[57:12] Jesus is
[57:14] God and and and and Matthew 5:1 17 he
[57:18] would say think not that I am come to
[57:20] destroy the law or the prophets but I am
[57:23] not come to destroy but to
[57:25] fulfill amen and as he would speak about
[57:28] it he'd say in other words I am not come
[57:30] to destroy the law but I am what the law
[57:33] was meant to produce the all that the
[57:36] law was it was meant to bring something
[57:39] to this magnitude something to this
[57:42] Perfection but without the Holy Spirit
[57:45] no man could do it it had to take God to
[57:49] come down and show that he could live it
[57:51] and that he would be perfect and that he
[57:53] could die for our sins and that he could
[57:56] give us his spirit so we could live the
[58:00] law
[58:03] Hallelujah now in order to understand
[58:05] this we have to go all the way back to
[58:07] the beginning of the process of adoption
[58:09] to understand the example of whose image
[58:12] exactly we're being formed into as we
[58:15] are being formed into the image of
[58:17] Christ Jesus as Christians not into the
[58:20] image of William brandham we're not
[58:22] being formed into the image of any man
[58:25] we're being formed into the image of
[58:27] God Amen and I want to just take if I
[58:30] could if we could focus a little bit
[58:31] tonight what I'll largely be focusing on
[58:33] is is for the young people so this is
[58:36] largely for you and then if if if some
[58:38] of the older ones that maybe don't think
[58:40] they're young people get something out
[58:42] of it God bless you but we're all young
[58:45] people in heart somewhere inside even no
[58:48] matter how old you are there's a little
[58:49] 19-year-old boy or girl just waiting for
[58:52] a body change amen waiting to put on
[58:55] immortality waiting to go back and
[58:57] desires to do all of the things that you
[59:00] once could do amen I know you don't get
[59:03] a lot of amens when you talk like that
[59:04] because the old people don't want to
[59:05] identify
[59:07] themselves that's all right but Mary
[59:10] thought brother Bram would talk about in
[59:12] the message uh God hiding himself in
[59:14] Simplicity he says what what Mary
[59:17] thought he says altogether no matter
[59:20] what the outside thought she pondered on
[59:24] all of the things as we said as she as
[59:26] Jesus said to her know ye not that I
[59:28] must be about my father's business the
[59:30] scripture records Mary hid all of these
[59:32] things in her heart amen and it says
[59:35] that no matter what anyone on the
[59:36] outside thought she pondered on these
[59:38] things within herself she hid them in
[59:41] her heart they know they couldn't say
[59:43] nothing bad against it once the word of
[59:45] God Jesus Christ once he spoke and said
[59:47] know you not I must be about my father's
[59:49] business they didn't retort they didn't
[59:51] come back to say well I'm your father I
[59:54] no they knew
[59:55] I can't say anything against that they
[59:57] just pondered it in their heart it
[59:59] became a reality and Joseph even knew
[1:00:02] different he knew whose baby that was
[1:00:05] Mary knew who the baby belonged to Jesus
[1:00:08] knew who his father was that's why he
[1:00:10] could say know you not I must be about
[1:00:12] my father's business and he wasn't down
[1:00:14] in the carpenter shop sawing
[1:00:17] wood he was about his father's business
[1:00:19] amen when the mother said can't you
[1:00:21] understand he says it's time that I be
[1:00:24] about my father's
[1:00:26] business now they thought this little
[1:00:28] cracked up child any illegitimate child
[1:00:30] is kind of an odd Curious Thing anyhow
[1:00:33] and there you are see but God hiding
[1:00:36] himself listen God hiding himself in
[1:00:39] what in what was thought of by the world
[1:00:42] as filth and Corruption and
[1:00:45] illegitimate but God HD himself in that
[1:00:48] the world looked at it one way and but
[1:00:51] all of those outside thinking brother BR
[1:00:53] would say Mary didn't care care about
[1:00:55] all that outside thought and all the
[1:00:57] Whispers that went around that it was
[1:00:59] filthy that it was corruption that it
[1:01:00] was illegitimate that it was something
[1:01:02] else but rather she pondered all of
[1:01:05] these things in her heart and as God hid
[1:01:08] himself in this look God hiding himself
[1:01:10] in the corruption of a dead sea to bring
[1:01:13] forth life oh praise be to God Christ
[1:01:16] our example God hiding himself in a dead
[1:01:20] sea to bring forth life God hides
[1:01:24] himself he says in a simple little
[1:01:27] washwoman or an ordinary man with his
[1:01:30] dinner under his arm and kisses wife and
[1:01:32] children goodbye and go out there maybe
[1:01:35] hide himself in that no man to in that
[1:01:38] no in that man to God would hide himself
[1:01:42] in that man to do something that the
[1:01:44] Archbishop would know nothing about you
[1:01:47] don't hear him blow no horns or sent out
[1:01:49] about it God just gets the glory that's
[1:01:52] all just simple hear it and and are glad
[1:01:56] God hides himself in simple people in
[1:01:59] Simplicity that's somebody that just
[1:02:01] maybe they just have they're the father
[1:02:04] of a home and they just take their lunch
[1:02:05] kit under their arm and they just kiss
[1:02:07] their wife and children goodbye and they
[1:02:09] head off to work and they begin
[1:02:11] witnessing and pretty soon there becomes
[1:02:13] a new believer in church and another new
[1:02:15] believer and the Pastor's going what's
[1:02:17] going on who's doing this but just
[1:02:18] somebody so simple just living a Godly
[1:02:22] life and God begins to move in such a
[1:02:25] way amen we just had a couple baptisms
[1:02:28] back at end time message Tabernacle in
[1:02:29] Emon of a couple men that they came from
[1:02:32] Ju Just backgrounds and and and and and
[1:02:35] and it was just from a a man in our
[1:02:37] church a brother in our church that just
[1:02:39] flew up to Fort McMurray every week
[1:02:41] every other week and he would just
[1:02:42] witness for the Lord he was there at
[1:02:45] work and every time he'd see somebody he
[1:02:46] witnessed for God and he'd be in the
[1:02:48] lunch reading a message book and
[1:02:49] witnessing to everybody he could just
[1:02:51] sharing the gospel you never heard about
[1:02:53] it until here comes a couple young men
[1:02:55] saying I need to get baptized I need to
[1:02:57] get right with God what was it what was
[1:02:59] it the fruit of just a Godly life that
[1:03:01] was lived God hiding himself in
[1:03:04] Simplicity amen it may not even be say
[1:03:07] I'm not even a father brother Andrew I
[1:03:09] don't have much you might just be a
[1:03:10] young person a young girl or a young boy
[1:03:13] that says I just go to school God hides
[1:03:15] himself in that he desires to have a
[1:03:17] testimony in the school in the home
[1:03:19] amongst your friends wherever you would
[1:03:21] go the simple day-to-day jobs that you
[1:03:23] would do
[1:03:24] that you would pick up here and there
[1:03:26] God wants to live his life through
[1:03:30] you
[1:03:33] Hallelujah God hides himself in in the
[1:03:36] Simplicity of a baby hiding himself in
[1:03:39] the Simplicity of a common
[1:03:42] family and the ecclesiastical and the
[1:03:45] great man and the minds and the genius
[1:03:47] and all of them and the herods and so
[1:03:49] forth of that day and the neros they
[1:03:52] just overlooked it
[1:03:55] God in
[1:03:57] Simplicity God has always moved that way
[1:04:00] don't never be discouraged when you look
[1:04:02] at the church and say it's so simple
[1:04:04] it's so small why isn't it bigger if
[1:04:06] this is really the truth why is why
[1:04:07] doesn't everybody believe this why why
[1:04:09] is it they're just booming here and
[1:04:11] booming there and people coming in and
[1:04:12] rushing in because God hides himself in
[1:04:17] Simplicity he reveals it to babes such
[1:04:20] as would learn hides it from the eyes of
[1:04:23] the wise and the prudent those that
[1:04:25] ought to know better but they
[1:04:29] won't re says now watch what God did
[1:04:32] when his son was born he let him go for
[1:04:36] 30
[1:04:37] years testing
[1:04:39] him trying him for 30 years we come up
[1:04:45] we know a little bit about the birth of
[1:04:47] Jesus and then it jumps over till when
[1:04:49] he's 2 years old and they run down to
[1:04:51] Egypt then it jumps over when he's 12
[1:04:53] years old and and he's there in the
[1:04:54] temple then we don't hear much about him
[1:04:57] for another 18 years till he's 30 years
[1:05:00] old and he's there getting baptized John
[1:05:02] the Baptist and everything going on but
[1:05:05] in that space of 18 years you don't hear
[1:05:07] much about it but the scripture gives us
[1:05:09] that little bit of insight into it where
[1:05:11] he says in in Luke 2:52 which says and
[1:05:15] Jesus increased in
[1:05:17] wisdom and stature and in favor with God
[1:05:21] and
[1:05:23] man and I want to just dwell on this a
[1:05:25] little bit because there's there's such
[1:05:28] an example to us especially as young
[1:05:30] people as what God desires for us to do
[1:05:34] and that it wasn't that there was great
[1:05:36] Miracles and things that were going on
[1:05:38] but there was something that Jesus was
[1:05:40] doing that he was growing in favor God
[1:05:43] was Finding favor in him men were
[1:05:46] finding favor in him he was becoming to
[1:05:49] a place where people would begin to look
[1:05:51] at him and say something's different
[1:05:53] about him I like that man I like that
[1:05:56] boy I like the way they are I like the
[1:05:58] way they carry themselves I like the way
[1:05:59] they talk I like the way they dress why
[1:06:02] something about what he was doing was
[1:06:04] causing him to have pleasure with
[1:06:08] God and now if we could if we could look
[1:06:11] at Galatians chter 4 and verse one it
[1:06:15] says now that the air as long as he is a
[1:06:19] child differ nothing from a servant
[1:06:22] though he be Lord of all
[1:06:25] amen and we're talking about Christ our
[1:06:27] example and I know uh as we get into
[1:06:30] this it'll be along the lines of
[1:06:32] adoption and as he begins to talk and
[1:06:35] Paul begins to lay out a certain
[1:06:37] principle he says but under tutors and
[1:06:41] governors until the time appointed of
[1:06:44] the father so Jesus even went through a
[1:06:47] time in his life there from 12 all the
[1:06:50] way up until he was uh 30 years old that
[1:06:53] that he was under a time that he was
[1:06:55] learning that he was he had subjected
[1:06:58] himself to his own natural uh I'll say
[1:07:01] guardians or parents to Mary and to
[1:07:04] Joseph as as their own son he subjected
[1:07:06] himself to them that they could raise
[1:07:08] him in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:07:11] Lord I believe that was Mary and
[1:07:13] Joseph's desire as they brought up their
[1:07:15] children to raise them right but even so
[1:07:18] the scripture goes on in verse three
[1:07:20] says even so we when we were children
[1:07:23] were in bondage bondage under the
[1:07:24] elements of the world but when the
[1:07:26] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:07:29] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:07:32] the law to redeem them that are under
[1:07:35] the law that we might receive the
[1:07:37] adoption of sons that it wasn't just for
[1:07:40] Jesus Christ but it was also for us and
[1:07:44] because you are Sons God hath sent forth
[1:07:47] the spirit of his of his son into your
[1:07:50] hearts crying Abba Father as we said
[1:07:53] last night God is in the business of
[1:07:55] turning hearts and he's able to send his
[1:07:58] Spirit of his son into the hearts of men
[1:08:01] whereby we would even begin to cry Abba
[1:08:04] Father or father father and he says
[1:08:07] wherefore art thou no more a servant but
[1:08:10] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:08:13] through Christ amen as we can pick up
[1:08:16] where brother Brandon would talk about
[1:08:18] you didn't become sons of God you always
[1:08:21] were a Son of God you always were
[1:08:24] because you could only be born of God if
[1:08:26] you were a part of God if you were in
[1:08:28] the mind of God before the foundation of
[1:08:30] the world that's what Redemption story
[1:08:33] is redeem means to bring back in other
[1:08:35] words it had to be somewhere first in
[1:08:37] order to bring it back to there amen it
[1:08:39] it wasn't just a purchase but it was a
[1:08:41] Redemption to bring you back to what you
[1:08:44] always were meant to be so you always
[1:08:47] were by predestination the sons of God
[1:08:49] but we we had to go through a process
[1:08:52] because we were born in sin we were
[1:08:54] shaped in iniquity we come into this
[1:08:55] world speaking lies the part of us that
[1:08:57] was a Son of God was the seed Gene of
[1:08:59] God that he put within our hearts that
[1:09:02] he put in our souls our flesh is not
[1:09:05] that our spirit is not that it needs to
[1:09:07] be trained it needs to come under
[1:09:09] subjection as as the scripture says in
[1:09:12] Romans 8:11 if the same spirit that
[1:09:14] raised up Christ from the dead dwells in
[1:09:16] you it will bring even your mortal
[1:09:19] bodies even this
[1:09:21] flesh Hallelujah it will Quicken your
[1:09:24] mortal body that's what the scripture
[1:09:26] says which means it will bring it into
[1:09:29] subjection to the spirit that is within
[1:09:32] that's how powerful the spirit of God is
[1:09:35] that it is able to bring your flesh into
[1:09:39] subjection oh praise God we could preach
[1:09:41] on that a whole lot longer but I want to
[1:09:43] just focus in on the tutor and then and
[1:09:46] and and to learn of the of the tutor
[1:09:48] because really the purpose of a tutor is
[1:09:51] to have you learn the knowledge and the
[1:09:54] wisdom of the
[1:09:56] tutor the tutor is bringing you
[1:09:59] knowledge and wisdom from the father to
[1:10:02] bring it down to you so that you could
[1:10:05] learn it so that you could operate under
[1:10:08] the authority of the father or by the
[1:10:12] authority of the Father the tutor is
[1:10:15] there to enable you to learn the
[1:10:17] knowledge and the wisdom because wisdom
[1:10:20] really is the ability to apply the
[1:10:23] knowledge in your everyday
[1:10:26] life and we need the wisdom of God it's
[1:10:29] not just knowledge unfortunately there's
[1:10:30] many theologians that have a whole lot
[1:10:32] of knowledge but no wisdom they have a
[1:10:35] lot of knowledge in the scripture and
[1:10:37] they could talk you this way and that
[1:10:38] way and this way and that way but they
[1:10:40] don't have a clue how to apply it in
[1:10:42] everyday life they needed a tutor they
[1:10:45] rejected the tutor of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:47] which is what God sent to bring us to
[1:10:50] the adoption of
[1:10:51] sons are you with me this this
[1:10:54] morning praise God how about this
[1:10:56] evening are you with me this evening
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:02] amen so really the the the purpose of
[1:11:04] the tutor then is to bring us to a place
[1:11:07] to increase Us in knowledge and in
[1:11:10] wisdom to enable us to operate by the
[1:11:14] authority of the father so that we know
[1:11:17] an adopted son brother Bron would talk
[1:11:19] about an adopted son where he'd say then
[1:11:21] your name on the check is as good as
[1:11:22] your father's check check or as your
[1:11:24] father's name on the check that whatever
[1:11:26] you say it's the same as him saying it
[1:11:28] but it's not some great thing but rather
[1:11:31] it's just a molding process that God
[1:11:33] wants to bring you through to bring you
[1:11:35] to a place of maturity to bring you to a
[1:11:39] place where you can handle the word of
[1:11:41] God in a mature way where he can trust
[1:11:44] you with his word are you with me and
[1:11:48] God operates by
[1:11:50] faith Hallelujah God operates by by
[1:11:53] faith and faith is a revelation of the
[1:11:57] will of
[1:11:58] God so what is it he reveals himself to
[1:12:01] you and that gives you faith in what to
[1:12:05] do and he reveals himself to you more
[1:12:09] and now as we can pick it up in John
[1:12:11] chap 16:12 we're going to get into that
[1:12:13] I don't want to get too far ahead of
[1:12:14] myself so forgive me John 16:12 says I
[1:12:18] have yet many things to say unto you but
[1:12:20] you cannot bear them now how be it when
[1:12:23] he the Spirit of Truth is come that's
[1:12:25] our tutor he will guide you into all
[1:12:28] Truth for he will not speak of himself
[1:12:31] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:12:34] he speak and he will show you things to
[1:12:37] come Hallelujah he will begin to speak
[1:12:40] to you and the Holy Ghost is what makes
[1:12:42] the word of God a reality to you why is
[1:12:46] it that in the days of the voice of the
[1:12:48] seventh angel all the mystery of God
[1:12:51] should be finished and yet how many
[1:12:53] believe
[1:12:54] it in other words how many is it a
[1:12:57] revelation to just a very
[1:13:00] few but yet he's revealed it he's shown
[1:13:03] it to you he's shown it to the world he
[1:13:05] went around the world seven times
[1:13:07] preaching the message of the hour he
[1:13:10] showed it with signs and wonders
[1:13:11] following he exactly fulfilled Malachi
[1:13:14] chapter 4 and God revealed all of the
[1:13:16] mysteries of God and yet so many people
[1:13:19] look at it and go I don't believe
[1:13:22] it because it has to be a revelation God
[1:13:25] himself by the spirit of God has to make
[1:13:28] it real to you
[1:13:33] personally I would say even even as a
[1:13:36] young person because when we often speak
[1:13:38] about adoption it becomes a big scary
[1:13:40] thing because we we look at Mount
[1:13:42] Transfiguration brother Bram says that
[1:13:44] was the adoption ceremony for for the
[1:13:46] Lord Jesus Christ and as we look at that
[1:13:48] and we will tonight Lord willing look
[1:13:50] farther into that but we look at it as a
[1:13:52] big scary thing as well he was got up on
[1:13:54] a mountain and he was transfigured into
[1:13:57] the the glorified body and the Lord God
[1:14:00] sha through him as the sun and it was
[1:14:02] just a wonderful experience and the
[1:14:04] cloud overshadowed and it began to speak
[1:14:06] out this is my beloved Son I'll never
[1:14:08] attain to
[1:14:10] that you will but it won't be just like
[1:14:15] that are you with me it won't look just
[1:14:19] like that he's not looking to bring you
[1:14:20] and through your buddies up on a
[1:14:22] mountain and do just what he did but
[1:14:24] he's looking to have sons and daughters
[1:14:27] who will live the Revelation that he
[1:14:29] gives them he's looking to have young
[1:14:31] people that will live the Revelation
[1:14:33] that he gives you he's looking to have
[1:14:36] old people that will live the revelation
[1:14:38] God gives to you he's looking to have
[1:14:40] fathers that will live the revelation
[1:14:42] God gives the father he's looking to
[1:14:44] have mothers that will live by the
[1:14:45] Revelation that God gives them when he
[1:14:47] gives a mother a revelation that she
[1:14:49] ought to be a keeper at home and she
[1:14:52] ought to be taking care of those
[1:14:53] children he's looking to see that she'll
[1:14:55] live by that Revelation and not always
[1:14:57] trying to be running here and running
[1:14:59] there and got to get a job and got to
[1:15:00] work and got to do this why he saying I
[1:15:03] gave you something to live by and
[1:15:05] instead you looked at the things of the
[1:15:07] world and wanted to live by it amen he
[1:15:10] looked at the fathers and he's trying to
[1:15:12] get to you through this message a
[1:15:13] revelation of what it is to be a high
[1:15:15] priest of the home are you with me now
[1:15:18] fathers he laid it out in the message of
[1:15:21] exactly what it is that you're the high
[1:15:23] priest of your home you're able to apply
[1:15:25] the token and apply the blood of Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ over your own home you're able to
[1:15:29] cast The Devils out of your own home
[1:15:31] you're able to have God in your home
[1:15:34] you're able to be an example to your
[1:15:36] children and he says I'm giving you that
[1:15:38] Revelation what are you going to do with
[1:15:40] it are you going to live by it or say
[1:15:42] you know what I mean my wife does a good
[1:15:44] job I think I'll go hang out with my
[1:15:47] buddies he says I gave you
[1:15:49] Revelation I'm looking for you to come
[1:15:52] to a place of maturity
[1:15:54] in what I've given you then I could give
[1:15:57] you more but I can't give you more until
[1:16:00] you live what I've already given you
[1:16:02] Hallelujah that's why these showdowns
[1:16:04] are so important when the first Showdown
[1:16:06] comes God is God until you get the
[1:16:08] Revelation that God is Sovereign and he
[1:16:10] is God and he is able to do what he will
[1:16:12] and he will perform his purpose one way
[1:16:15] or another until you get that Revelation
[1:16:18] he cannot go further with
[1:16:21] you well that got quiet
[1:16:24] he's not going to show you the intricate
[1:16:26] Secrets if you don't even know who he
[1:16:30] is my wife goes home with me she knows
[1:16:35] me she's my wife I share with her
[1:16:38] everything but she knows who I
[1:16:41] am I could talk to somebody else who
[1:16:44] doesn't know me I could say how many
[1:16:46] kids do I
[1:16:48] have and they go I don't
[1:16:52] know
[1:16:53] I could just come right down here let me
[1:16:55] just make this very plain how y'all
[1:16:57] doing
[1:16:58] tonight brother what's your name brother
[1:17:01] Chad pleasure to meet you God bless you
[1:17:03] what do I do for work I do no what do I

[1:17:23] hands your brother Chad God bless you
[1:17:25] I'm brother Andrew pleasure to meet you
[1:17:28] but he doesn't know me how many have met
[1:17:31] the Lord Jesus
[1:17:33] Christ and all of a sudden they want
[1:17:35] well I want great Revelations I met him
[1:17:37] I had a feeling I had an altar call I
[1:17:40] went through a prayer line I I I was in
[1:17:42] my prayer closet I met him but do you
[1:17:44] know
[1:17:45] him are you really in his word do you
[1:17:48] meditate upon it day and night is it
[1:17:50] something that that you just came can't
[1:17:53] help but consume your mind with I was
[1:17:56] just I went for a walk today it was a
[1:17:57] lot longer than ID hoped for but I quite
[1:17:59] enjoyed it to be honest with you and as
[1:18:02] I be to walk and I my wife was there and
[1:18:04] sister Blanca was our guide and she she
[1:18:06] brought us out and as we were walking
[1:18:07] and I just lag behind and Le behind and
[1:18:10] I was thinking on the Lord the whole
[1:18:12] time and God began to come down in such
[1:18:14] a sovereign way actually rearranged my
[1:18:17] whole notes for tonight and begin to
[1:18:19] show me exactly what to speak and
[1:18:21] exactly how to speak it and how to
[1:18:23] address it to the young people how to
[1:18:25] make sure it's a reality to you why I
[1:18:29] begin to meditate upon the word of God
[1:18:32] I'm not lifting myself up I'm just
[1:18:33] saying that's the way a Christian
[1:18:35] lives get get yourself aside to God
[1:18:38] begin to meditate on him David said I
[1:18:40] write your word upon my bed post I
[1:18:42] meditate upon it day and night I do all
[1:18:44] these things why do I do it why because
[1:18:46] there's something about God when he
[1:18:48] could come in and you might not know the
[1:18:49] answer to a question there's been so
[1:18:51] many times CU I'm a plumber by day by by
[1:18:53] the way and as as I would be there and
[1:18:54] plumbing and I there'd be questions that
[1:18:56] I would have and something that I
[1:18:57] couldn't figure out something that just
[1:18:59] I remember laying on my side one time
[1:19:01] and trying to fix a sister's hot water
[1:19:03] tank the drain had broken and I went to
[1:19:05] go unscrew it and thing just
[1:19:07] cracked oh it's full of water and it's
[1:19:09] her H it's a sister's house I wasn't
[1:19:11] charging her very much because I just
[1:19:13] for the parts because I thought man I
[1:19:15] just do her do her quick something
[1:19:18] and
[1:19:19] favor and now it's going to leak all
[1:19:21] over her house maybe flood it and I just
[1:19:23] prayed I said God I don't I don't want
[1:19:26] to flood this sister's house help me out
[1:19:29] and somehow I managed to thread on a
[1:19:30] hose and that little plastic drain 3/4
[1:19:33] of the way around it was cracked it held
[1:19:35] on to drain the entire
[1:19:37] tank and then I was able to take it off
[1:19:40] and I had to lay on my side between a
[1:19:42] little little hacksaw and cut a little
[1:19:45] piece of plastic out of there and then
[1:19:46] slowly unthread it the whole time
[1:19:48] praying Lord I hope this works I don't
[1:19:51] want to have to go upstairs and tell the
[1:19:52] sister you need need a new tank you know
[1:19:54] that $50 part you needed well now you
[1:19:56] need $1,000 part I was just praying Lord
[1:19:59] don't let that be the case and God
[1:20:00] allowed at all to work out right well
[1:20:03] God's a real present help in a time of
[1:20:06] trouble no matter how great or no matter
[1:20:08] how small the need is he cares if it
[1:20:12] matters to you it matters to the master
[1:20:14] Satan is a very good way very good at
[1:20:17] throwing distractions our way and
[1:20:18] throwing thoughts at us to make us
[1:20:21] distracted I was telling a couple the
[1:20:23] other day as we were talking and they
[1:20:25] said you know I find it amazing you'll
[1:20:26] go on Facebook and you'll just use
[1:20:28] Facebook for something good you know
[1:20:29] sisters they like Facebook they can look
[1:20:31] up recipes and they can scroll through
[1:20:32] recipes they can scroll through buy and
[1:20:34] sell and you know I said why don't you
[1:20:37] ask God about recipes
[1:20:39] then because Satan will put a thought in
[1:20:41] your mind you're not even thinking about
[1:20:42] cooking anything but all of a
[1:20:45] sudden he's like what about this recipe
[1:20:47] you're like oh and he'll he knows he's
[1:20:50] got you down the road it ain't sinful
[1:20:54] looking up recipes Brothers is not
[1:20:57] sinful but he's got you going down a
[1:20:59] road where all of a sudden you've end
[1:21:01] you've become to an endless scroll for
[1:21:02] two
[1:21:04] hours and now you're exhausted and
[1:21:06] you're going to bed Brothers he's got
[1:21:08] you doing the same thing you get talking
[1:21:11] about something and all of a sudden I
[1:21:12] wonder if there's somebody could show me
[1:21:14] how to use that tree stand I was
[1:21:15] thinking about getting in the next thing
[1:21:17] you know you're watching hunting videos
[1:21:18] for hours on end and you're watching we
[1:21:21] were talking about the other day
[1:21:22] woodwork and videos and different things
[1:21:23] that we just as men it's not sinful it's
[1:21:26] not evil things that we're doing but
[1:21:28] what's sinful about it is the time Satan
[1:21:31] is just putting something in front of
[1:21:33] you just to distract you he knows he
[1:21:35] doesn't have to get you to go out and
[1:21:36] commit adultery he's just got to get you
[1:21:39] away from
[1:21:40] God and so why don't you and why don't I
[1:21:43] I'm preaching myself here too why don't
[1:21:45] we go to God lord I was thinking about a
[1:21:47] recipe
[1:21:49] today I always get so quiet when you
[1:21:51] talk like that oh brother we ought to
[1:21:53] only pray great spiritual prayers oh
[1:21:57] then we are of most men most
[1:22:00] miserable when he's a friend that sticks
[1:22:02] closer than a
[1:22:04] brother he cares about the things that
[1:22:06] matter to you whether they be big
[1:22:09] whether they be small whether you're
[1:22:11] thinking this morning I I'd like to go
[1:22:13] out and get myself a moose whether
[1:22:14] you're thinking I'd like to bake a nice
[1:22:16] dessert whether you thinking I I'd just
[1:22:18] like to know about if there's a dress
[1:22:20] Lord I just maybe get on my knees first
[1:22:22] and say Lord I don't want to waste two
[1:22:24] hours
[1:22:25] looking maybe I could spend some time
[1:22:27] with you first and talk to you cuz
[1:22:29] pretty soon you'll find out when you get
[1:22:31] that first layer off that those first
[1:22:34] thoughts of the recipe the first
[1:22:36] thoughts of the dress the first thoughts
[1:22:37] of the hunting you'll find there's a
[1:22:39] whole lot down underneath there that God
[1:22:42] begins to pull out of you and you begin
[1:22:44] to enter into another place of prayer
[1:22:47] something that you don't even know as
[1:22:48] the spirit says in Romans chap as the
[1:22:50] Bible says in Romans chapter 8 you don't
[1:22:52] even know how to properly even make
[1:22:54] utterance for but the spirit of God
[1:22:56] begins to make utterance on your behalf
[1:22:58] it begins to pray for you why all it
[1:23:01] took was you getting on your
[1:23:03] knees and just
[1:23:06] worship worship isn't always raising
[1:23:08] your hands and it's time
[1:23:11] spent with somebody it's a life lived
[1:23:15] for somebody it's all a form of
[1:23:20] worship amen
[1:23:31] so we could look at it then and realize
[1:23:33] there's there's different levels then of
[1:23:37] adoption there's different levels of
[1:23:39] adoption because God's not going to give
[1:23:42] a 9-year-old boy the same responsibility
[1:23:45] he gives his
[1:23:47] dad
[1:23:49] right God's not going to reveal himself
[1:23:52] in the same way Jesus at 12 years old
[1:23:56] even he wasn't realizing what was going
[1:23:59] to happen at
[1:24:00] 30 see he was God he knew all things but
[1:24:03] the fullness of the godhead came into
[1:24:05] him at that day when the spirit came
[1:24:07] down in the form of a dove and God
[1:24:09] emptied himself into him
[1:24:12] there that was when the anointing came
[1:24:15] before that he was a son he was perfect
[1:24:17] he was born but he didn't know all
[1:24:19] things and he was walking according to
[1:24:22] the word that he
[1:24:24] had he knew he was born right he knew he
[1:24:27] was the the Son of God he knew that he
[1:24:29] was born for a purpose he knew his flesh
[1:24:31] was perfect he knew all these things but
[1:24:33] he didn't live frivolously no he gained
[1:24:36] favor with God and with men other words
[1:24:40] he was not cocky about
[1:24:41] it Cockiness doesn't gain you favor with
[1:24:44] men I know he wasn't that way but rather
[1:24:48] he was
[1:24:49] humble he lived with the spirit of God
[1:24:52] in him
[1:24:55] humble as we can look at it and go to
[1:24:58] Lamentations chapter
[1:25:01] 3 verse
[1:25:03] 26 said it is good for a
[1:25:06] man that it is good that a man should
[1:25:09] both hope and quietly wait for the Lord
[1:25:13] wait for the Salvation of the Lord it is
[1:25:17] good for the man to Bear the Yoke in his
[1:25:21] youth
[1:25:23] young people it's good for you to be in
[1:25:27] service to God in your
[1:25:30] youth you don't have to wait to a
[1:25:32] certain age and just wonder when but
[1:25:34] just
[1:25:35] quietly quietly wait on the salvation of
[1:25:38] the Lord quietly serve God quietly bear
[1:25:42] the Yoke you don't have to be up and say
[1:25:45] well I I've got a gift to play the piano

[1:25:48] think I can play the piano now I got it

[1:25:54] it no quietly serve and say hey if
[1:25:57] there's anything I can do just let me
[1:25:59] know is's there any way I can help God's
[1:26:02] looking to bring you to a place of
[1:26:04] adoption even as a young person to live
[1:26:07] in a mature way in his word it doesn't
[1:26:10] mean you can't be a young person how did
[1:26:13] you understand that doesn't mean you
[1:26:15] can't be a young person and have fun
[1:26:17] young people sometimes like to stay up
[1:26:19] half the
[1:26:20] night and
[1:26:22] talk and go out and have fun and if I
[1:26:26] talk about the young guys where I come
[1:26:28] from they like to step half the night
[1:26:30] and have pillow fights and I heard later
[1:26:32] on Belt fights and all kinds of thing
[1:26:35] that they just boys being boys and out
[1:26:37] there just having
[1:26:40] fun but God's saying you don't you don't
[1:26:43] have to be a 60-year-old man and just
[1:26:45] come to church and go to bed at 7 and
[1:26:47] wake up at 6 and everything's okay no
[1:26:50] you're still a young person
[1:26:53] you're still young enjoy let no man
[1:26:55] despise thy youth the scripture
[1:26:57] says but rather you can still be a young
[1:27:01] person and be mature in the
[1:27:03] word that pertains to
[1:27:06] you
[1:27:08] Hallelujah nobody who's really led by
[1:27:10] the spirit of God is going to come to a
[1:27:12] young sister and talk about where
[1:27:13] Timothy talks about pastors so you
[1:27:16] really ought to be in control of your
[1:27:19] own home and you really ought to no
[1:27:20] that's not for you
[1:27:23] that's for the pastor that's his level
[1:27:26] of adoption to come to as a young person
[1:27:28] you've got a different level to come to
[1:27:32] I know I'm just taking it real slow
[1:27:33] tonight I hope it's all
[1:27:38] right Isaiah chapter
[1:27:41] 40 and verse 30 would say even the
[1:27:44] youths
[1:27:45] faint and be
[1:27:47] weary and the young man shall utterly
[1:27:51] fall
[1:27:52] that sounds horrible but what it's
[1:27:55] saying is God knew that you would fall
[1:27:57] flat on your
[1:27:58] face God knew as a young man you would
[1:28:01] fall in your God knew as a young woman
[1:28:03] that you would make mistakes where you
[1:28:05] would be down on your face going God I
[1:28:07] am not even a Christian anymore I've
[1:28:10] definitely lost it but he says I know it
[1:28:13] you'll get weary you'll get faint you
[1:28:15] will utterly fall down on your face he
[1:28:18] says but they that wait on the Lord
[1:28:21] shall renew do their strength they shall
[1:28:23] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[1:28:25] run and not be weary they shall walk and
[1:28:27] not faint amen he's saying there is a
[1:28:30] way to get back up on your feet wait
[1:28:33] quietly upon the salvation of the lord

[1:28:38] it's good to be in service to God and
[1:28:40] recognize you're going to make mistakes
[1:28:43] and that is
[1:28:44] okay Hallelujah we all say that together

[1:29:11] face and make mistakes but they don't
[1:29:13] need to stay there blessed be the name
[1:29:16] of the Lord 1 Timothy 4:12 says let no

[1:32:52] but foolish and unlearned questions
[1:32:56] avoid knowing that they do gender
[1:33:00] Strife let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:33:06] 4 I got have to turn to it Matthew
[1:33:08] chapter 4 and verse
[1:33:16] one as we look at our example here in
[1:33:20] the Lord Jesus Christ I've taken way too
[1:33:22] much time already I think I'm still on
[1:33:24] page
[1:33:25] one
[1:33:26] so forgive
[1:33:32] me Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 it says
[1:33:37] then was Jesus led of the spirit now
[1:33:40] we're talking about Born Again
[1:33:42] Believers once again don't put that off
[1:33:45] to somebody else say well I'm
[1:33:48] only 14 years old I'm only 16 I'm only
[1:33:52] 18 no you're going to receive the new
[1:33:54] birth very young and God begin to child
[1:33:57] train
[1:33:58] you sometimes that's the fault of the
[1:34:01] oldest generation we look down at young
[1:34:03] people and go they ain't born again
[1:34:04] because they ain't like
[1:34:06] me no they're not going to be like you
[1:34:08] because they're
[1:34:10] 16 you're however old you are 60 70 80
[1:34:16] 32 that's that's how old you are you're
[1:34:18] going to act like that they're going to
[1:34:20] act like a 16-year-old an 18-year-old a
[1:34:23] 20-year-old that's how they're going to
[1:34:25] be we need to see God manifesting
[1:34:28] himself in our individual lives
[1:34:30] according to the measure of Grace he
[1:34:32] gives
[1:34:33] us and in Matthew chapter 4 now he
[1:34:35] begins to write this way Jesus led up
[1:34:37] the spirit now Into the Wilderness to be
[1:34:41] tempted of the devil oh that sounds
[1:34:47] amazing every Christian's
[1:34:49] dream let's go out in the Wilderness to
[1:34:52] be tempted of the devil the spirit of
[1:34:54] God will lead you to do things sometimes
[1:34:56] that you're going to sit there by day
[1:34:57] two and go what am I doing
[1:34:59] here God's got you there for a
[1:35:03] reason the next verse says and when he
[1:35:06] was fasted 40 days and 40
[1:35:09] nights oh praise God this is getting
[1:35:13] better first he's led up by the spirit
[1:35:15] for purpose to be tempted of the devil
[1:35:17] and now he says now you're going to wait
[1:35:19] 40 days and 40 nights don't eat nothing
[1:35:23] but it was the spirit leading him well
[1:35:26] the says the only way you can do a
[1:35:27] spirit a fast like that is if it's the
[1:35:29] spirit of God that's LED you to do that
[1:35:31] don't ever try and do that on your own
[1:35:33] it'll it'll drive you crazy you'll lose
[1:35:35] your mind but he says it was the spirit
[1:35:37] of God that led him out there and he
[1:35:38] says and afterwards he was 100 and then
[1:35:41] and when the tempter came to him he said
[1:35:43] if thou be the Son of God command that
[1:35:46] these Stones be made of bread and he
[1:35:48] answered and said it is written man
[1:35:51] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:35:53] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:35:55] mouth of god notice after 40 days after
[1:35:57] 40 nights he knew the purpose of him
[1:35:59] being out there was to be tempted but
[1:36:01] God had to get him to such a place so
[1:36:03] that we could know that even the weakest
[1:36:05] of Christians could defeat the enemy
[1:36:08] with the word of God Amen and he got him
[1:36:10] right out there onto the backside of the
[1:36:12] desert for all of this time and took all
[1:36:14] of his strength out of him till he could
[1:36:16] not rely upon the human flesh though it
[1:36:20] was perfect
[1:36:21] though it was born right though it
[1:36:23] didn't have any flaws he still said you
[1:36:26] cannot rely upon that whatsoever because
[1:36:29] I've got Sons and Daughters coming that
[1:36:31] you are going to be their high priest
[1:36:33] and you need to be able to be touched by
[1:36:35] the feeling of their infirmities you
[1:36:37] need to be tempted in all manner like
[1:36:39] they are that when you and I are in our
[1:36:41] weakest condition we can still
[1:36:45] overcome
[1:36:46] Hallelujah the word of
[1:36:49] God my my my
[1:36:53] it showed that the weakest Christian can
[1:36:55] defeat Satan just with the words Jesus
[1:36:58] had powers he could have smoked Satan he
[1:37:01] had the power of the Holy Ghost within
[1:37:02] him but the way any way that he wanted
[1:37:05] to he could have done it but he didn't
[1:37:06] use it he just took the word and
[1:37:09] defeated him with it is written it is
[1:37:12] written the word of God will defeat the
[1:37:14] Devil any time any place anywhere under
[1:37:17] any
[1:37:18] circumstances the word of God will
[1:37:20] defeat the Devil
[1:37:23] it is it it is able to defeat him under
[1:37:25] any circumstances and I'm going to say
[1:37:27] it this way with or without the New
[1:37:29] Birth the word of God does not lose its
[1:37:33] power but rather if you'll have faith in
[1:37:36] the word of God and come against the
[1:37:38] enemy with the word that is the kind of
[1:37:40] faith that God will recognize and fill
[1:37:43] with his spirit because the spirit
[1:37:46] always comes to the word hallelujah how
[1:37:49] do I get born again just stay with the
[1:37:52] word of God and have faith in it and
[1:37:54] continually produce that to the devil
[1:37:56] and God will recognize
[1:37:59] that oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:38:03] and you can't just say one word unless
[1:38:05] God you can't just say you can't say one
[1:38:08] word to God unless he knows it the
[1:38:10] weakest of saints makes the devil
[1:38:13] tremble praise be to God and you're his
[1:38:16] children you have fully when you have
[1:38:18] fully with all of your hearts each one
[1:38:20] of you fully laid your life before God
[1:38:23] and said God mold me and make me the
[1:38:26] kind of Christian that's been talked
[1:38:27] about here tonight and I want to give my
[1:38:30] life that way just take all things out
[1:38:32] of my life that's wrong that's the way I
[1:38:35] want to be by your grace Lord I'll live
[1:38:37] every day for you watching for my life
[1:38:39] to pattern right up with the Bible
[1:38:42] requirements that's the way we ought to
[1:38:44] come to the Waters of baptism that's the
[1:38:47] way we ought to come to repent and be
[1:38:49] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:38:50] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
[1:38:52] filled with the Holy Ghost that's a
[1:38:54] promise if we could come that way and
[1:38:56] say Lord I want my whole life to be
[1:38:59] pattern and I'm going to stay right
[1:39:00] behind the word until you come and back
[1:39:03] it
[1:39:04] up
[1:39:05] Hallelujah that's exactly what Jesus was
[1:39:08] doing here he was saying he had all
[1:39:10] kinds of power but he said I'm not going
[1:39:11] to use it it is also written Hallelujah
[1:39:15] the devil taking him up then on a into
[1:39:17] the holy city Seth him on the Pinnacle
[1:39:19] of the temple and he said if thou be the
[1:39:21] Son of God and he began to quote to him
[1:39:23] more of the word cast thyself down for
[1:39:25] it is written if the angels are given
[1:39:27] charge over thee and and and and and and
[1:39:29] in in their hands they will bear thee up
[1:39:31] lest thou Dash thy foot against the
[1:39:33] stone but he said it is also
[1:39:36] written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
[1:39:38] thy God hallelujah even in his weakest
[1:39:42] State he knew who he was even in his
[1:39:45] weakest State he had faith in what the
[1:39:48] word of God said about him saints of God
[1:39:51] ought to be such an encouragement to us
[1:39:52] that even in our weakest condition no
[1:39:55] matter how weak we are how downtrod and
[1:39:57] how depressed and how horrible it gets
[1:39:59] we ought to have faith in what the word
[1:40:01] of God says we
[1:40:03] are Moses was able to have faith in what
[1:40:06] the word of God said about him even when
[1:40:07] he come up to the Red Sea and he's
[1:40:09] sitting there two million people around
[1:40:11] him murmuring and complaining saying
[1:40:13] Moses you brought us up here to die we
[1:40:16] got a water before us mountains on the
[1:40:17] sides we got the Egyptians on their back
[1:40:19] wasn't there enough graves in Egypt why
[1:40:21] did you bring us out here all of that
[1:40:24] going
[1:40:25] on and he
[1:40:28] realized God I'm the
[1:40:31] deliverer what did he say to the people
[1:40:33] before he ever even prayed to God if you
[1:40:35] look it up in the scripture when you go
[1:40:36] home before he ever even prayed to God
[1:40:39] and said Lord what must I do he turned
[1:40:40] to the people and he said be still this
[1:40:43] day you will see the salvation of the
[1:40:46] Lord he had confidence in what the word
[1:40:48] had told him to do he didn't understand
[1:40:51] understand how because he immediately
[1:40:52] turned right back around and said Lord
[1:40:53] what do I do and God said why are you
[1:40:55] crying unto me speak and go forward lift
[1:40:57] up the rod and stretch out your hand and
[1:40:59] part The Waters from east to west and
[1:41:01] walk across I told you to meet me on the
[1:41:03] mountain meet me on the mountain
[1:41:06] Hallelujah when God gives you Revelation
[1:41:08] he expects you to live it he gives you
[1:41:11] Grace to fulfill
[1:41:17] it and we know that Satan tempted him
[1:41:19] again in all the these things will I
[1:41:21] give thee if thou will fall down and
[1:41:23] worship me he offered to forfeit all of
[1:41:26] the kingdoms of the earth to
[1:41:28] him then he saith Jesus saith unto him
[1:41:31] get thee hence Satan for it is written
[1:41:34] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[1:41:36] him only shalt thou worship and the
[1:41:39] devil leaveth him and
[1:41:42] behold the Angels
[1:41:45] Came and ministered unto
[1:41:48] him God will put you through trial and
[1:41:51] through
[1:41:52] Temptations through
[1:41:54] moldings that sometimes see
[1:41:57] unbearable but he won't give you more
[1:41:59] than you can
[1:42:00] bear go with me to Hebrews chapter
[1:42:12] 11 Hebrews chapter 11 verse
[1:42:16] 38 scri the scripture in Hebrews chapter
[1:42:18] 11 talks about The Heroes of Faith and
[1:42:22] all the things that they've been through
[1:42:23] and how they
[1:42:24] stood by
[1:42:26] faith in
[1:42:29] God says in verse 38 of whom the world
[1:42:31] was not
[1:42:33] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[1:42:35] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[1:42:37] the earth and these all having obtained
[1:42:40] a good report through faith they
[1:42:43] obtained favor with
[1:42:46] God but Reed not the
[1:42:49] promise for God having provided some
[1:42:53] better thing for
[1:42:56] us that they without us should not be
[1:43:00] made
[1:43:02] perfect Hallelujah in other words
[1:43:04] complete that word there they could not
[1:43:06] be complete without us coming this way
[1:43:11] God didn't put you on this Earth too
[1:43:15] late you might say I'm just a young
[1:43:17] person you might be just a young child
[1:43:19] the rapture's coming any day
[1:43:21] God didn't put you on this Earth too
[1:43:23] late you're here and he put you in a
[1:43:26] home to give you the best
[1:43:28] chance for you to receive
[1:43:32] him he wants to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:43:35] more than you want to receive
[1:43:39] it and he doesn't care how you get
[1:43:42] it Oh
[1:43:45] my he doesn't care as long as you get
[1:43:49] it we ought not to
[1:43:52] care so I just it's got to be at a pray
[1:43:55] it's got to be a certain brother it's
[1:43:56] got to be a certain this it's got to be
[1:43:57] a certain that no get that out of our
[1:43:59] minds the carnality of
[1:44:01] it say no it's got to be Jesus and
[1:44:07] me that's the common
[1:44:10] denominator but how you get it whether
[1:44:12] it's at an
[1:44:13] altar praise God whether it's in the
[1:44:16] quiet of your prayer closet whether
[1:44:18] you're out for a walk around a riverbed
[1:44:19] and you find come down to your knes of
[1:44:21] God and God comes and meets you there
[1:44:24] wherever it may be it might be on the
[1:44:25] job working you might be working
[1:44:27] wherever you need to work and God comes
[1:44:28] on the scene and you just begin to think
[1:44:30] about him I got to work but I got God on
[1:44:33] my mind and you begin to just think on
[1:44:35] him let him draw
[1:44:38] nigh Hebrews chapter 12 to carry on it
[1:44:41] says wherefore seeing we also are
[1:44:43] compassed about with such a greater
[1:44:45] cloud of witness let us lay aside every
[1:44:48] weight and the sin with th so easy
[1:44:50] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:44:52] patience the race that is set before
[1:44:55] us looking unto Jesus he is our example
[1:45:00] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[1:45:03] finisher Hallelujah it wasn't just that
[1:45:05] it was something he started he's able to
[1:45:07] finish what he started he's the author
[1:45:10] and the finisher of our faith who for
[1:45:12] the joy that was set before him inured
[1:45:14] the cross despising the shame and is sat
[1:45:17] down at the right hand of God in other
[1:45:19] words he has full power and Authority
[1:45:21] for considering him that endured such
[1:45:24] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[1:45:27] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[1:45:30] minds other words consider what he went
[1:45:32] through he was tempted in all manner
[1:45:34] like we are tempted consider what he
[1:45:37] went through consider the contradiction
[1:45:38] of Sinners consider the things that he
[1:45:41] had to go through being perfect and yet
[1:45:43] he took all sin upon
[1:45:45] himself and took it back onto the
[1:45:49] devil lest you be wearied and faint in
[1:45:52] your minds ye have not yet resisted unto
[1:45:55] blood striving against sin ye have
[1:45:58] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:46:01] unto you as unto children my son despise
[1:46:04] not thou the chastening of the Lord now
[1:46:08] we're coming back to the tutor despise
[1:46:10] not thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:46:13] faint when thou art rebuked of him for
[1:46:17] whom the Lord loveth he lets them do
[1:46:20] whatsoever they
[1:46:22] please is that what it
[1:46:24] says no he says for whom the Lord loveth
[1:46:27] he chasteneth and scourges every son
[1:46:31] whom he
[1:46:32] receiveth Hallelujah if ye endure
[1:46:35] chastening God then dealth with you as
[1:46:38] Sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:46:41] chasteneth not but if ye be without
[1:46:44] chastisement whereof are all our
[1:46:47] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:46:50] Sons other words if you refuse the
[1:46:52] chastening of the Lord he can't deal
[1:46:55] with you as a son he cannot give you any
[1:46:57] more Revelation he cannot show you
[1:46:59] anymore he cannot bring you any higher
[1:47:01] in Heights with him he can't show you
[1:47:03] any more love if you won't accept what
[1:47:06] he sends
[1:47:11] you he says for as much furthermore we
[1:47:14] have had fathers of our flesh which
[1:47:16] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[1:47:19] shall we not WAP rather in the be in
[1:47:22] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:47:24] and
[1:47:25] live we've all been there as sons and as
[1:47:28] daughters we gave our fathers reverence
[1:47:30] and we respected them when they
[1:47:32] corrected us and when they spanked us
[1:47:34] and when they grounded us and when they
[1:47:36] put us in our rooms and when they did
[1:47:37] all these things to us that we thought
[1:47:39] man it's so hard I'm not enjoying this
[1:47:41] but it was for a purpose it made you out
[1:47:44] to be who you are today the kind of
[1:47:46] person that helped to mold your
[1:47:48] character in The Natural but he says how
[1:47:50] much more to the one who's able to mold
[1:47:52] your character in the spirit how much
[1:47:55] more to the father of the spirits that
[1:47:57] could bring you
[1:47:59] life
[1:48:00] Everlasting for verily for they verily
[1:48:03] for a few days chastened us after their
[1:48:05] own pleasure but he for our
[1:48:10] profit that he that we might be
[1:48:12] partakers of his Holiness now no
[1:48:15] chastening for the presentence seeth to
[1:48:16] be joyous but Grievious nevertheless
[1:48:19] afterward it yith Peaceable fruit of
[1:48:21] righteousness unto them that are
[1:48:23] exercised thereby amen there's a
[1:48:26] scripture that says that the the
[1:48:27] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:48:29] even worthy to be compared with the joy
[1:48:31] that shall be re with the glory that
[1:48:33] shall be revealed in US amen and I just
[1:48:35] want to say this to you that does not
[1:48:37] diminish the sufferings you're going
[1:48:39] through that doesn't diminish the
[1:48:41] hardness of the trials those trials are
[1:48:44] still difficult those trials are still
[1:48:45] hard the things that you're going
[1:48:47] through it's still difficult I think a
[1:48:49] brother now and going for for knee
[1:48:51] surgery that's not easy that's hard
[1:48:53] that's something that's difficult to go
[1:48:55] through but that even isn't worthy to be
[1:48:57] compared with the fact that God has a
[1:48:59] glory that he desires to reveal in you
[1:49:01] that is so great that the former things
[1:49:05] will not even come into
[1:49:07] mind Hallelujah the chastisement of this
[1:49:10] current time this the this 70 years and
[1:49:13] then it's Grace after that is not even
[1:49:15] worthy to be compared with what God has
[1:49:18] in store for you
[1:49:21] Jesus was born a perfect birth if we
[1:49:23] could take a step back here for a minute
[1:49:25] his flesh was not born by sexual desire
[1:49:28] he it was completely God God created
[1:49:31] himself in the womb of Mary you can go
[1:49:33] ahead and read the message book called
[1:49:34] The revelation of Jesus Christ it's at
[1:49:36] the beginning of the church age book he
[1:49:38] says that God created himself in the
[1:49:40] womb of in the womb of a woman and
[1:49:42] overshadowed her just as he overshadowed
[1:49:44] his first creation and brought it to
[1:49:46] brought to pass the spoken words so did
[1:49:49] he there with the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:49:52] even in that Perfection God put him
[1:49:54] through a testing period because the
[1:49:56] spirit that was in him the Holy Spirit
[1:49:58] Jesus did not need to be born
[1:50:01] again are you with me Jesus did not need
[1:50:05] to be born again he was born right the
[1:50:06] first
[1:50:09] time but still his baptism was was a
[1:50:13] washing was like a washing of the
[1:50:14] sacrifice it was not like the baptism of
[1:50:17] Acts chapter 2 where he had to repent he
[1:50:19] was perfect
[1:50:21] but furthermore the spirit that came
[1:50:22] down on the on the on that baptism was
[1:50:25] the anointing of the fullness of the
[1:50:27] attribute of God as even brother Bram
[1:50:29] says questions and answers 1964 he says
[1:50:32] now the pillar of fire is the logos that
[1:50:34] went out of God the logos which is
[1:50:37] actually the attribute of the fullness
[1:50:40] of
[1:50:42] God when God become come into the form
[1:50:46] where he could be seen it was the
[1:50:48] anointing of the great spirit that that
[1:50:50] went forth its condescending coming down
[1:50:52] God the Father the logos that was up
[1:50:55] over Israel he was holy he could not
[1:50:57] bear the sin there was there had to be a
[1:50:59] blood offering right there in Eden then
[1:51:02] that logos become flesh and dwelt Among
[1:51:04] Us and where this logos dwelt in a human
[1:51:06] body which that body was the
[1:51:09] sacrifice are you with me still when man
[1:51:13] was when man was made in the image of
[1:51:15] God and when man come when God come down
[1:51:17] in the image of man to redeem man and
[1:51:21] brought man and God together and Heaven
[1:51:23] and Earth hugged and kissed each other
[1:51:26] God and man embraced each other as
[1:51:28] fatherhood and sunship when the Loos
[1:51:31] became flesh and dwelt Among Us when was
[1:51:34] it that God came down and spoke and said
[1:51:36] this is my beloved
[1:51:39] Son it was that day on the
[1:51:41] Riverside when after he' been baptized
[1:51:43] and he come out and he stood there and
[1:51:46] the fullness of God the attribute of the
[1:51:49] fullness of of God came down and rested
[1:51:51] on him then he said this is my beloved
[1:51:55] Son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:51:58] dwell that was after years of
[1:52:03] testing years of making sure years of
[1:52:07] trying years of
[1:52:09] proving brother goes on that same quote
[1:52:11] where he says God for 30 years proved
[1:52:14] him then he says then he gave him three
[1:52:17] years of hard
[1:52:18] trial that's largely what we have
[1:52:21] recorded in the gospels 3 years of hard
[1:52:25] trial then at the end of that hard trial
[1:52:28] when he seen that his son was about the
[1:52:30] father's business then Mount
[1:52:34] Transfiguration he took Peter James and
[1:52:36] John the witnesses went up on the top of
[1:52:38] the mountain there God performed the law
[1:52:41] of adoption they looked up they saw
[1:52:43] Jesus and his clothes shining his
[1:52:44] lightning and the cloud overshadowed him
[1:52:46] a voice come out of the cloud and said
[1:52:47] this is my beloved Son now it wasn't
[1:52:50] just in whom I'm pleased to dwell it
[1:52:51] said hear ye
[1:52:54] him
[1:52:58] Hallelujah there was a pillar of fire
[1:53:00] let me ask you this where was the pillar
[1:53:01] of fire we could actually read it in
[1:53:03] Matthew chapter 7
[1:53:04] 17 maybe we won't just to save time but
[1:53:07] Matthew chapter 17 it talks about this
[1:53:09] this occasion where now Jesus is brought
[1:53:11] up on the mountain and they come and his
[1:53:13] he was transfigured before them and
[1:53:15] Moses and Elijah appeared and his face
[1:53:17] is said sha like the sun and and and and
[1:53:20] his rements were shining as well and as
[1:53:22] as he was there and and we know Peter
[1:53:24] spoke up and said let's make three
[1:53:25] Tabernacles one for Elijah one for John
[1:53:28] and one for G or one for Moses and one
[1:53:30] for Jesus let's make ourselves three
[1:53:32] Tabernacles and let's have a
[1:53:34] wonderful let's make a denomination out
[1:53:36] of this really is what he's
[1:53:38] saying let's let's make sure everybody
[1:53:40] knows but then when they looked up again
[1:53:42] when the voice spoke and they fell on
[1:53:43] their face and when they looked up again
[1:53:44] they saw
[1:53:45] one it was Jesus and over him overshadow
[1:53:49] ing him was a cloud that was there as
[1:53:52] there was a cloud that had over
[1:53:53] overshadowed him and behold the voice
[1:53:55] spoke out of the cloud and said this is
[1:53:57] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:53:58] hear ye him other words there it was at
[1:54:01] The Showdown just like it was in the
[1:54:02] first Showdown where there was a pillar
[1:54:04] of fire that came down and consumed the
[1:54:05] sacrifice and there was a cloud about
[1:54:07] the size of the man hand now you have
[1:54:09] again you have a pillar of fire and you
[1:54:10] have a cloud you say but where was the
[1:54:12] pillar of fire brother Andrew it was in
[1:54:15] him in him was the fullness of the
[1:54:17] attribute of God and what's the lust the
[1:54:21] pillar of fire what's the pillar of fire
[1:54:22] it's the fullness of the attribute of
[1:54:24] God the attribute of the fullness of God
[1:54:26] sorry it was right there remember
[1:54:29] Colossians chap 1: 19 says for it
[1:54:31] pleased the father that in him should
[1:54:33] all fullness
[1:54:35] dwell it was in him it was shining out
[1:54:38] so that even his face Shone as the glory
[1:54:42] of the
[1:54:46] sun if we go to John chapter 16
[1:54:51] are you still with me is this okay if we
[1:54:52] take a few more minutes
[1:54:58] tonight if you ever need to stand up and
[1:55:00] Shake Yourself you won't bother
[1:55:02] me I'll just take it as you're praising
[1:55:08] God John chapter 16:1
[1:55:18] 15 says all things that the father hath
[1:55:21] are
[1:55:22] mine therefore said I that he shall take
[1:55:25] of mine and shall SW it unto you a
[1:55:29] little while and you shall not see me
[1:55:31] and again a little while and you shall
[1:55:34] see me because I go to the
[1:55:38] father then said some of his disciples
[1:55:42] among
[1:55:43] themselves what is this that he saith a
[1:55:45] little while remember if you go back I
[1:55:48] know I didn't read it but if you go go
[1:55:49] back to Matthew chapter 17 you find out
[1:55:52] Jesus told them don't tell anybody this
[1:55:54] who was there Peter James
[1:55:57] John don't tell anybody this there was
[1:56:00] something the three of them that they
[1:56:01] recognized when he's saying yet a little
[1:56:03] while I go away and yet a little while
[1:56:05] I'll come back he began to recognize I I
[1:56:07] I think I'm understanding what you're
[1:56:09] talking about they seen him glorified
[1:56:12] God had revealed something to them but
[1:56:13] to the rest of them they're
[1:56:15] wondering what's he talking about God
[1:56:18] will reveal himself to you in the right
[1:56:20] time in the right season it wasn't the
[1:56:23] time for the rest of them to know but it
[1:56:24] was time for Peter James and John to
[1:56:29] know in John chapter 6 and verse 63 he
[1:56:33] says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:56:36] and the flesh profiteth
[1:56:39] nothing amen the spirit quickeneth but
[1:56:43] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[1:56:45] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[1:56:48] and they are life
[1:56:50] so Jesus begins to lay out as as as we
[1:56:53] we were speaking on earlier stay and
[1:56:56] have faith in the word the spirit will
[1:56:58] come to that because it's my words that
[1:57:00] I'm speaking unto you they are spirit
[1:57:02] and they are life in Christ the Myster
[1:57:05] of God reveal he says but by Revelation
[1:57:07] that God has revealed his word to you he
[1:57:11] is the word and the word how you know
[1:57:14] it's revealed it lives itself and
[1:57:17] expresses himself through you
[1:57:20] hallelujah it's not us trying to express
[1:57:23] the word but rather it's God trying to
[1:57:26] express himself through
[1:57:31] you John
[1:57:36] 14:23 says Jesus answered and said unto
[1:57:38] them if a man love me he will keep my
[1:57:41] words and my father will love him and he
[1:57:44] will come unto him and make and we will
[1:57:47] come unto him and make our Abode with
[1:57:51] him if you'll do what the word
[1:57:56] says we will love
[1:57:58] you he's saying and I will come and make
[1:58:01] my Abode with you he that loveth me not
[1:58:05] and keepeth not my
[1:58:07] sayings and the word which you hear is
[1:58:10] not mine but the Father which sent me
[1:58:14] Hallelujah see I I don't speak anything
[1:58:16] this this now this is John chapter 14
[1:58:18] John chapter 16
[1:58:19] this is after Mount
[1:58:21] Transfiguration this is after he said
[1:58:23] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:58:25] pleased to dwell hear ye him he's saying
[1:58:28] listen the words that I'm speaking
[1:58:29] they're not my words but it's the father
[1:58:32] that's speaking hear the words of the
[1:58:35] father hear what he's speaking unto you
[1:58:37] he's saying but the comforter which is
[1:58:38] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[1:58:41] in my name he will teach you all things
[1:58:43] and he will bring all things to your
[1:58:45] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:58:47] you amen peace I leave with you my peace
[1:58:51] I give unto you not as the not as the
[1:58:54] world giveth give I unto you let not
[1:58:56] your heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:59:00] afraid if you go down into John 16: 27
[1:59:04] he says for the father himself loveth
[1:59:06] you because you love me and have
[1:59:09] believed that I come out from God I come
[1:59:12] forth from the father I am and am come
[1:59:15] into the world and again I leave the
[1:59:18] world and go to the father he say listen
[1:59:21] you you you you you love me you love you
[1:59:24] love what you see in me because you love
[1:59:26] me the father loves you because he's
[1:59:30] he's beginning to express exactly who he
[1:59:32] is and recognizing that the mount
[1:59:34] Transfiguration it was a showdown it was
[1:59:36] something that was happening it was God
[1:59:39] proving
[1:59:40] himself God only brings it to a showdown
[1:59:43] to prove who he is not to prove who you
[1:59:46] are and who this person is and lift up
[1:59:48] somebody but God wants to prove himself
[1:59:51] God wants to perform brother brandham
[1:59:53] would say he wants to perform his word
[1:59:55] in you he wants to bring it to pass and
[1:59:58] now he's coming to a place where he's
[2:00:00] beginning to express to his disciple
[2:00:02] Christ being our example saying listen I
[2:00:05] and the father are
[2:00:07] one well the words that I speak are the
[2:00:09] father's words this is what it is to be
[2:00:12] an adopted son this is what it is to
[2:00:15] have the spirit of God living and
[2:00:17] walking and express pring itself through
[2:00:20] you cuz he's not saying this is just for
[2:00:23] me no he says when the Holy Ghost is
[2:00:24] come he will also bring to remembrance
[2:00:27] all the things that I spoke to you what
[2:00:29] did he speak to you just the letters and
[2:00:31] red no the whole thing that was the word
[2:00:34] of God and then he bring in our day
[2:00:36] through a prophet and brought the word
[2:00:38] of God for our day and he says I'll
[2:00:40] bring that to your remembrance by the
[2:00:43] Holy Ghost how could I ever remember I
[2:00:46] got 12200 tapes approximately and I've
[2:00:48] listened listen to them over and over
[2:00:50] but how will I ever remember all that
[2:00:52] you don't have to it's there in the
[2:00:54] Eternal Realms of God and when you need
[2:00:56] it he'll bring it back to your
[2:00:58] remembrance and cause you to say
[2:01:00] something that all of a sudden you're
[2:01:01] left going that wasn't
[2:01:03] me oh praise be to God why because it's
[2:01:06] him in you Christ the hope of
[2:01:12] glory he says when you have when you can
[2:01:15] present the token with your prayer
[2:01:17] what's the token the token today is the
[2:01:20] spirit of God it's the life that was in
[2:01:22] the blood amen back in the Old Testament
[2:01:25] it was the blood of the Lamb that was
[2:01:26] upon the doorpost upon the lentil but
[2:01:28] today it's not the blood because we
[2:01:30] don't have any of the literal blood but
[2:01:32] it's the life that was in the blood it's
[2:01:34] the Holy Spirit when that is in your
[2:01:36] life he says when you have the token to
[2:01:39] present with your prayer it shows that
[2:01:41] you have fully come into obedience to
[2:01:44] the whole word of
[2:01:47] God you cannot look at that
[2:01:50] carnally cuz as soon as you look at that
[2:01:52] carnally you're going to look at this
[2:01:54] and say but I don't know the whole word
[2:01:56] of
[2:01:58] God but all that he's revealed to
[2:02:02] me I've come into obedience
[2:02:07] to that's the token and you present that
[2:02:11] with your
[2:02:12] prayer he says
[2:02:15] then then you and the world word what's
[2:02:20] the word Christ you and the word are
[2:02:24] one you're only asking for the thing
[2:02:28] that you
[2:02:34] are when you begin when you and the word
[2:02:37] become one when you can present the
[2:02:39] token with your prayer and you could
[2:02:41] pray Lord I know that by your stripes
[2:02:43] I'm Healed you're only asking for what
[2:02:45] you
[2:02:47] are heal
[2:02:50] when you're asking and saying Lord I
[2:02:52] desire peace in my home you're only
[2:02:55] asking for what you
[2:02:58] are when you're asking for your family
[2:03:01] you're only asking for what you
[2:03:04] are when you're asking for Revelation
[2:03:07] you're only asking for what's already in
[2:03:12] you he says then when you and the word
[2:03:15] becomes one every promise glory to God
[2:03:18] every every promise is
[2:03:20] yours then he makes these three word
[2:03:23] statements he says it obeys
[2:03:30] you the promises obey
[2:03:35] you says
[2:03:37] then you want to watch what you want to
[2:03:42] do you shouldn't put your hand in a fire
[2:03:45] and just saywell see me do it oh no see
[2:03:49] but if there's something in that fire I
[2:03:51] got to reach for it'll obey me
[2:03:56] Hallelujah in other words don't be
[2:03:58] tricked by all the firew walking and
[2:03:59] going on that's just the devil's
[2:04:02] show but he says you don't just put your
[2:04:04] hand in there God's not a
[2:04:05] show he's not interested in just out
[2:04:09] there for somebody's
[2:04:10] entertainment but if something fell in
[2:04:12] the
[2:04:14] fire just like Paul an adopt his son he
[2:04:17] gets out there on the
[2:04:19] on that island can't remember what the
[2:04:21] island was called The Malta but he's out
[2:04:25] there and they're getting a fire going
[2:04:28] and he gets go goes out and picks up
[2:04:30] sticks and he comes back he throws the
[2:04:32] sticks in the fire and a Viper comes out
[2:04:34] and latches onto his
[2:04:36] hand what does he
[2:04:38] do he just shakes it off and goes and
[2:04:41] picks up more
[2:04:43] sticks and they start going this guy
[2:04:45] he's a witch he's something else that
[2:04:48] thing didn't affect him but then when
[2:04:50] the word begin to come out of his mouth
[2:04:52] they to realize this man ain't no witch
[2:04:55] this is a Son of God this is somebody
[2:04:58] that has power and his body has been
[2:05:00] brought into subjection by The Same
[2:05:01] Spirit that raised up Christ from the
[2:05:03] dead that it didn't matter how much
[2:05:04] venom that thing pumped into him he said
[2:05:06] even if serpent bite thee it won't harm
[2:05:08] you even if I drink any deadly thing it
[2:05:11] won't harm you are you with
[2:05:16] me he says watch the inspiration
[2:05:19] then he says that's the way it strikes
[2:05:22] you if you're
[2:05:25] sick that's the way it strikes you if
[2:05:27] you're Afflicted something that's
[2:05:29] revealed to you and you see it that it's
[2:05:32] been revealed then you speak
[2:05:35] up if you're sick and all of a sudden
[2:05:37] God reveals to you you're healed then
[2:05:40] you speak up and you jump up and say I'm
[2:05:43] Healed he says then God tells you what
[2:05:45] to do rise up and start walking amen
[2:05:48] that's that's it it's all over then you
[2:05:50] can do it that way that's the way God
[2:05:53] does it when you see God manifested
[2:05:56] through yourself other words it ain't
[2:05:58] you doing it it's not based on your
[2:06:00] ability but rather when the Holy Ghost
[2:06:03] In You latches a hold of the word of God
[2:06:05] and begins to realize I don't have to
[2:06:08] live the way I've been living I don't
[2:06:10] have to walk the way I've been walking
[2:06:12] it doesn't matter how many years this
[2:06:13] has gone on God's word says I'm Healed
[2:06:16] it's over
[2:06:20] Hallelujah we got a wonderful example of
[2:06:22] a man named John Ryan who went for
[2:06:24] months and months proclaiming after the
[2:06:26] prophet of pray for him going out saying
[2:06:28] praise God I can see praise God I can
[2:06:30] see praise God I'm Healed praise God I
[2:06:32] can see extra extra Read All About It
[2:06:34] praise God I'm Healed blind as could
[2:06:37] be but one day
[2:06:40] Hallelujah sitting there in the barber
[2:06:43] chair it becomes such a reality in his
[2:06:45] heart as the barber was trying to mock
[2:06:47] him and make fun of of him God brought
[2:06:49] it to a showdown to show it was God not
[2:06:52] just John Ryan it was God in a man
[2:06:55] saying I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed
[2:06:57] and he jumped out of that barber chair
[2:06:59] and went running out shaving cream all
[2:07:00] down his face Barber's frock on him
[2:07:03] saying praise the Lord I can
[2:07:05] see oh
[2:07:08] hallelujah
[2:07:11] hallelujah sometimes we're too afraid
[2:07:13] that maybe it won't happen too afraid
[2:07:15] that maybe something won't happen God
[2:07:16] begins to spark something in our heart
[2:07:18] we begin to put water on it and push it
[2:07:20] down and push it down because we're too
[2:07:22] afraid it won't happen it didn't happen
[2:07:24] last time it won't happen this time if
[2:07:26] God's trying to show you something stand
[2:07:27] up in the name of the Lord amen if
[2:07:30] you're feeding on the word faith comes
[2:07:32] by hearing see it depends on what you're
[2:07:34] feeding on that will give you the faith
[2:07:36] to rise up and claim What the Lord Has
[2:07:38] for you Jesus had 18 years to feed on
[2:07:42] the right
[2:07:44] things yeah he had 18 years silent years
[2:07:47] from 12 to 30 years old what was he
[2:07:49] doing he found pleasure with God God was
[2:07:51] pleased with him he grew in favor with
[2:07:54] God and we find why why would that be
[2:07:56] because he was feeding on the right
[2:07:58] things he was meditating on the word he
[2:08:00] was making sure that he was he was
[2:08:03] feeding on what was right and praying
[2:08:05] and staying in touch with the
[2:08:07] Lord oh
[2:08:12] my you and I have received a portion of
[2:08:15] God in this in the seed form by pred
[2:08:18] destination but when he fills you with
[2:08:20] his Spirit which is the tutor that comes
[2:08:23] into you he wants to teach you so he can
[2:08:26] anoint you for the job he has for you
[2:08:29] because adoption of sons is to be
[2:08:31] positionally placed in Christ Jesus so
[2:08:34] what's the tutor doing then he's
[2:08:38] teaching he's trying to mold you for the
[2:08:41] purpose that God has for
[2:08:45] you we know that to be born again that's
[2:08:47] the minimum requirements to go in a
[2:08:49] Rapture but that's the minimum
[2:08:51] requirements God has a purpose for you
[2:08:55] God has a purpose for you in this life
[2:08:57] and God has a purpose for you beyond
[2:08:59] this life let me tell you this Saints
[2:09:01] don't ever be scared oh my sometimes it
[2:09:03] becomes such a place in our age in our
[2:09:05] day especially for young people where
[2:09:07] you get the feeling I don't have a
[2:09:08] purpose who am I the church has a pastor
[2:09:11] there's a piano player there's a guitar
[2:09:12] player there's a bass player there's
[2:09:14] there's a deacon there's a trustee
[2:09:15] there's a sound tech I don't do anything
[2:09:17] for God I'm I'm I'm not made for
[2:09:19] anything God has a purpose for you and
[2:09:22] it might not be playing and and and and
[2:09:24] and singing and doing certain things you
[2:09:26] might say I can't even sing I couldn't
[2:09:27] hold a tune in a bucket brother Andrew I
[2:09:29] don't know anything about a bumblebee in
[2:09:30] a jar I don't know nothing about that I
[2:09:32] can't make any good sounds like that but
[2:09:34] we find that God has a purpose for you
[2:09:36] because he said know ye not that the
[2:09:38] saint shall judge the
[2:09:41] Earth God has a purpose for you to be
[2:09:44] his bride God has a purpose for you to
[2:09:47] rule Ru and reign with him God has a
[2:09:50] purpose for you to be there as his bride
[2:09:54] adoring for her husband coming down on
[2:09:56] of Heaven God has a place for
[2:10:00] you maybe your purpose isn't really on
[2:10:02] this side very much but on the other
[2:10:05] side we got the parable of the 11th Hour
[2:10:08] worker there was some that came early in
[2:10:10] the day some that came in the midday
[2:10:12] some that came in at the 11th hour and
[2:10:15] they they all got the same pay
[2:10:19] but the the early ones being to complain
[2:10:21] hey these people that didn't do very
[2:10:22] much they got the same pay what's up
[2:10:24] with this we should get more or they
[2:10:26] should get less something like this
[2:10:27] because they didn't do as much as we did
[2:10:29] but the master said no is it not lawful
[2:10:32] for me you agreed to a
[2:10:35] wage what's what's what's the parable we
[2:10:38] agreed to a wage I will give you eternal
[2:10:41] life the promise was to them in there
[2:10:45] back there in Ephesus the promise is to
[2:10:46] us today the promise is to you whether
[2:10:49] you've been serving the lord for your
[2:10:50] whole entire life and you've gone on and
[2:10:52] labored and labored and labored and
[2:10:54] seems like I just can't go on anymore or
[2:10:56] whether you were just born and God comes
[2:10:58] in a Rapture and you're gone in the
[2:11:00] Rapture oh praise be to God it doesn't
[2:11:03] matter God says whether you're the first
[2:11:04] hour worker or the 11th Hour worker the
[2:11:07] the the the payment is the
[2:11:10] same oh praise be to
[2:11:17] God
[2:11:20] Jesus had to feed on the right
[2:11:25] thing sometimes we're so afraid of
[2:11:27] saying the wrong thing that we filter
[2:11:29] everything coming out of our
[2:11:31] mouth so that's not a bad thing brother
[2:11:33] Andrew the Bible says that a man that
[2:11:35] can har that can a man that can Bridle
[2:11:37] his tongue is perfect in all of his
[2:11:40] ways didn't Jesus say that it's not what
[2:11:42] goes into a man that defiles a man that
[2:11:44] what comes out of a man that defiles him
[2:11:46] therefore we ought to be really careful
[2:11:48] what we say we ought to be really
[2:11:49] careful what goes out of us what's in
[2:11:50] the outlet and sometimes we get so bound
[2:11:53] up in what's going on the outlet that we
[2:11:55] forget to filter the
[2:11:58] inlet I want to just say this to you
[2:12:00] tonight I want to encourage you
[2:12:02] sometimes we got to take the filter off
[2:12:03] of the outlet and put it on the inlet
[2:12:06] stop trying to filter everything going
[2:12:07] out if you'd filter what came in if what
[2:12:10] was coming in was clean if what was
[2:12:12] coming in was God if what was coming in
[2:12:14] was the word then what was going out
[2:12:15] would be God what was going out would be
[2:12:17] the word why because it's what comes in
[2:12:19] and what makes you what you are and what
[2:12:20] goes out will be just that but if it's
[2:12:22] coming in all kinds of junk and all
[2:12:24] kinds of internet and all kinds of other
[2:12:26] things that just wasting our time and
[2:12:28] all of a sudden we get around the saints
[2:12:29] of God and they're talking about God and
[2:12:30] we're struggling to try and think of the
[2:12:32] right thing to say because there's all
[2:12:34] kinds of garbage in our
[2:12:36] brains why because we're filtering the
[2:12:39] outlet we're trying to legalistically
[2:12:42] live the
[2:12:45] word but instead
[2:12:48] if we try and filter the
[2:12:52] inlet say God I just want to feed on
[2:12:54] your word just want to meditate on that
[2:12:57] day and night what will come out will be
[2:13:01] easy you can't help but talk about God
[2:13:04] when all you're thinking about is
[2:13:06] God you can't help but talk about the
[2:13:09] message when all you're listening to is
[2:13:10] the
[2:13:11] message you can't help but talk about
[2:13:13] the Bible when all you're reading is the
[2:13:15] Bible I saying you can't read other
[2:13:17] books and you can't listen to other
[2:13:18] things there's good things out there
[2:13:19] that'll help you help you understand and
[2:13:21] apply in daily life but let it come into
[2:13:23] continuity with the
[2:13:33] word would help us just be able to let
[2:13:37] go let go and let God have his
[2:13:41] way I just need to skip over some things
[2:13:46] here
[2:13:49] God told
[2:13:50] Moses that he gave him the
[2:13:53] land we love preaching on this every
[2:13:55] place the soul of your foot would tread
[2:13:57] I give it
[2:13:59] you right praise God every place every
[2:14:02] promise in the book is yours every
[2:14:04] chapter every verse every line praise be
[2:14:06] to
[2:14:07] God ah what's a
[2:14:10] promise wasn't feeding on it I don't
[2:14:12] really know what the promises are can't
[2:14:15] think of one off the top of my
[2:14:16] head
[2:14:19] we like that right every promise in the
[2:14:22] book is mine wherever The Souls of your
[2:14:24] feet shall tread well then that means
[2:14:25] you got to walk around in the
[2:14:28] word that means you got to be in the
[2:14:30] word that means you got to read it that
[2:14:32] means you got to pray about it means you
[2:14:34] got to seek God for
[2:14:37] it every place they had to fight for
[2:14:41] every inch of
[2:14:44] it it's not going to be easy Saints
[2:14:47] you'll have have to fight for every inch
[2:14:48] of it praise God I'm Healed now you got
[2:14:51] to fight for every inch of
[2:14:56] it so do we have to fight for V of it it
[2:14:59] isn't something to be babied and
[2:15:02] petted and around like that and say well
[2:15:05] I'll take you over there see what you
[2:15:07] think about it and you just pass your
[2:15:09] opinion that's no way to come he says
[2:15:12] come with a
[2:15:14] determination come that you're going to
[2:15:16] stay there till it's over
[2:15:19] stay there till God answers and
[2:15:21] vindicates a man that believes in God
[2:15:24] can see the presence of God feel the
[2:15:27] presence of God sense the presence of
[2:15:29] God and know that he's there this is in
[2:15:32] God's provided way for this day he says
[2:15:35] he he can know that he's there he is
[2:15:37] here to answer everything that he made
[2:15:40] promis for in his day who can do that a
[2:15:43] man that believes in God that believes
[2:15:47] the word in other words someone that
[2:15:49] receives what God sends he says they cry
[2:15:52] then cry till you get it hold on to him
[2:15:53] don't leave if you have to stay day and
[2:15:55] night God won't want his children to
[2:15:57] listen to intellectual speeches I hope I
[2:16:00] haven't been an intellectual speech
[2:16:02] tonight God doesn't want his children to
[2:16:03] listen intellectual speeches he says he
[2:16:05] wants them to cry out for it till the
[2:16:08] promise is
[2:16:10] Vindicated praise be to God God wants to
[2:16:13] give you the Holy Ghost God wants you to
[2:16:15] cry out until you get it Israel at one
[2:16:19] point in time was fighting battles
[2:16:20] outside of the promised
[2:16:22] land Israel at one point in time they
[2:16:25] were wondering in the wilderness right
[2:16:27] they wandered for 40 years down there in
[2:16:28] the wilderness because of their sin
[2:16:30] because of their lack of of faith that
[2:16:32] they couldn't have faith in the word of
[2:16:34] God the 10 spies brought back an evil
[2:16:35] report God said fine I'll let you all
[2:16:37] die off here and as they wandered around
[2:16:38] the Wilderness there came up against one
[2:16:41] by the name of aab Bashan and he was a
[2:16:43] great the the the biggest man that ever
[2:16:44] lived in the Bible and he had a great
[2:16:46] big army and he had all these things and
[2:16:47] he began to afflict them but they were
[2:16:49] able to overcome them because they could
[2:16:52] look at Moses and they could see that as
[2:16:55] long as the word of God was there as
[2:16:57] long as the prophet of the age was there
[2:16:58] the word for their day they could
[2:17:00] overcome by the word without the Holy
[2:17:04] Ghost oh Hallelujah they weren't in the
[2:17:07] promised land yet they were in the
[2:17:09] wilderness they hadn't received the
[2:17:11] promised land is a type of the Holy
[2:17:12] Ghost they hadn't received that yet they
[2:17:14] were still out wondering and getting
[2:17:16] Sanctified and washing the water of the
[2:17:18] word was still going on but as long as
[2:17:20] they could see the word as long as they
[2:17:22] stayed with that Prophet they were
[2:17:24] victorious it was the time when they
[2:17:26] said we don't need you anymore Moses
[2:17:27] we're going to go take the land
[2:17:28] ourselves what happened they were
[2:17:30] horribly defeated because they got out
[2:17:32] from behind the word but as long as they
[2:17:35] had the word for their day there with
[2:17:37] them they were victorious when the
[2:17:38] amalekites came against them they were
[2:17:40] victorious and you might even tonight be
[2:17:42] looking saying brother Andrew I don't
[2:17:44] think I'm born again I don't think I'm
[2:17:46] there yet let me encourage you you're
[2:17:48] able to defeat Giants without the Holy
[2:17:54] Ghost oh that gets quiet but that's the
[2:17:58] truth because that is the power of the
[2:18:00] word of God if you could just stay with
[2:18:03] the message and stay with the word and
[2:18:05] say it might not be a reality to me but
[2:18:07] God made it real and he will one day
[2:18:10] bring me to it and those giants can't
[2:18:13] bother
[2:18:14] you aab Basham was in the wilderness and
[2:18:16] he was a giant sometimes we
[2:18:18] underestimate the power of God do we
[2:18:20] really have a revelation that God is God
[2:18:22] do we really have a revelation that
[2:18:24] Jesus is God that he's the one
[2:18:27] Hallelujah that he's able to defeat the
[2:18:29] enemy if we'll just have faith in the
[2:18:30] blood of Jesus Christ he cleanses you
[2:18:33] from all
[2:18:35] sin sometimes we try and put it off way
[2:18:37] off in something mystical and something
[2:18:40] way up there yonder in the stars and
[2:18:42] it's got to be some wonderful birth and
[2:18:43] God's going to take me up and put me off
[2:18:46] somewhere no it's right down in a simple
[2:18:48] common family that God hides
[2:18:52] himself oh praise be to God I hope
[2:18:54] you're catching what I'm preaching
[2:19:00] tonight but when they got into canaan's
[2:19:02] land when they crossed the river Jordan
[2:19:05] the reason for their fight
[2:19:10] changed it changed their whole purpose
[2:19:12] of being it renewed their
[2:19:16] strength
[2:19:19] there was a will Beyond themselves that
[2:19:21] they could fight longer even than a day
[2:19:23] because it was their their their
[2:19:25] inheritance that they were fighting for
[2:19:28] it wasn't them fighting anymore but now
[2:19:30] it was there them in the Holy Ghost that
[2:19:32] was fighting it was them in the promised
[2:19:35] land they were in the land flowing with
[2:19:36] milk and honey they could fight and not
[2:19:39] be
[2:19:40] wary Joshua was given the promise saying
[2:19:43] you won't lose one so when he lost one
[2:19:44] he said something's wrong they're sit in
[2:19:46] the camp
[2:19:48] Hallelujah we ought not to lose one if
[2:19:50] we're losing them something's wrong
[2:19:53] there's unbelief
[2:19:54] somewhere Hallelujah and if it takes we
[2:19:56] got to get it out we got to get it out
[2:19:58] but we need to get right with
[2:20:00] God oh
[2:20:02] my it changed their whole purpose of
[2:20:05] being it changed they wasn't fighting
[2:20:06] for themselves anymore they weren't just
[2:20:08] fighting to survive they were
[2:20:11] Overcomers an 80-year-old man could say
[2:20:14] give me the most difficult Mountain and
[2:20:17] that Amaze you I trust you know your
[2:20:19] Bible very
[2:20:20] well as they would go there and they
[2:20:22] would take it and they all of them would
[2:20:24] come to the promised land Caleb would
[2:20:25] come to Joshua 80 years old and say I
[2:20:29] want Mount Hein the Land of the
[2:20:32] Giants give me my
[2:20:34] Mountain maybe Joshua look at him and
[2:20:36] say oh well we'll give you some men to
[2:20:38] fight with you we'll let you have this
[2:20:39] well you know you sure you want that
[2:20:42] let's give you some easier land maybe no
[2:20:44] Jay Caleb said I don't want nothing
[2:20:46] easier I want my Mountain cuz my soul
[2:20:49] The Souls of my feet have tread upon
[2:20:51] that mountain don't you remember Joshua
[2:20:53] that's where we got in the valley of Esa
[2:20:55] we got those big grapes right down there
[2:20:56] by Mount heon we were right there and we
[2:20:58] were right oh we I want those grapes
[2:21:01] again I want to know what it's like I
[2:21:03] want to live in that land praise be to
[2:21:05] God you might have had the Holy Ghost on
[2:21:07] your flesh you might have had the Holy
[2:21:08] Ghost on your spirit but if you get that
[2:21:10] kind of an attitude like Caleb say I
[2:21:11] don't care what it takes I want to live
[2:21:14] in that land I want to live in a land
[2:21:16] that flows with milk and I want a taste
[2:21:18] of the promises of God I want it so that
[2:21:20] those promises obey me so whatever I say
[2:21:24] come on
[2:21:29] church it's not about your fighting
[2:21:31] abilities it's about the Holy Ghost in
[2:21:33] you it's not about what you can do for
[2:21:35] God it's about what he's already done
[2:21:37] for you amen it's the word of God that
[2:21:39] defeats the enemy and the Holy Spirit In
[2:21:41] You changes what you're fighting for it
[2:21:43] changes your whole desires it changes
[2:21:45] your whole purpose of being you might be
[2:21:47] fighting something else tonight but
[2:21:49] inside the promised land you're not a
[2:21:51] Survivor you're an overcomer you're more
[2:21:54] than an overcomer because he said I have
[2:21:56] be of good cheer he says in the world
[2:21:58] you shall have tribulation but be of
[2:21:59] good cheer I have overcome the world
[2:22:02] that makes you more than an overcomer oh
[2:22:05] praise be to
[2:22:07] God he says I think I've that that we've
[2:22:09] made many mistakes by looking into the
[2:22:11] word and say God said this and we fail
[2:22:13] to find the direct revelation of our
[2:22:16] life to fit in that program think about
[2:22:20] that he says this is where the church
[2:22:21] has made so many mistakes they look into
[2:22:23] the world and said God said this and God
[2:22:25] said that but we fail to find the direct
[2:22:27] Revelation for our life to fit that
[2:22:30] program and when we find that then it's
[2:22:33] going to happen oh praise be to God when
[2:22:36] you find yourself in the world what is
[2:22:38] it a personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:22:42] to you then it's going to
[2:22:46] happen for whom he did for know he did
[2:22:49] also predestinate to be conformed into
[2:22:51] the image of his son that he might be
[2:22:53] the firstborn among many brethren we
[2:22:57] look at Christ our example and all the
[2:22:59] things he had to go through and all of
[2:23:00] the trying and the 30 years and the
[2:23:02] three years of hard testing to finally
[2:23:04] get up there to mount Transfiguration
[2:23:06] but it wasn't so that he could stand
[2:23:07] there alone it was so that he could be
[2:23:09] the
[2:23:10] firstborn among many Brethren so that
[2:23:13] you could be conformed Into His Image so
[2:23:15] that you could come into his likeness
[2:23:18] brother B would say but the
[2:23:19] predestinated will will hear and will be
[2:23:22] ready for the Rapture the Royal Seed of
[2:23:25] Abraham like with like Faith to
[2:23:28] Abraham's will hold to the word with him
[2:23:31] for they are predestinated
[2:23:33] together Hallelujah you're predestinated
[2:23:36] together as we said that Loos that came
[2:23:39] down out of heaven and dwelt in Christ
[2:23:41] Jesus the fullness of the attribute of
[2:23:43] the attribute of the fullness of God
[2:23:45] this logos that was in him which was the
[2:23:47] the spirit of God the anointing this is
[2:23:49] from questions and answerers 64 he says
[2:23:51] the anointing though the S through
[2:23:53] through the Sanctified Grace of the
[2:23:56] blood has brought many sons of God which
[2:23:59] is Anointed with the same
[2:24:02] logos oh praise be to God that in Christ
[2:24:06] the fullness of God dwelt but we know
[2:24:08] that the brother BR would say but all
[2:24:10] that was in Christ he poured into the
[2:24:12] church that there on in Acts chapter 2
[2:24:16] when they came in the day of Pentecost
[2:24:17] was fully come that same logos that was
[2:24:19] in its fullness in Christ came down and
[2:24:22] broke itself into many pieces and went
[2:24:24] by part but what Christ had in fullness
[2:24:28] you have in part so let me ask you this
[2:24:31] God is an infinite God is that right
[2:24:35] he's an infinite God in other words
[2:24:36] there is no ending there is no beginning
[2:24:39] he's Eternal he's infinite he knows all
[2:24:42] things he's all powerful so let me ask
[2:24:46] you this if you have a portion of
[2:24:48] infinite what exactly do you
[2:24:53] have it's
[2:24:55] infinite half of infinite is
[2:24:58] infinite a tenth of infinite is infinite
[2:25:01] a millionth of infinite is infinite a
[2:25:03] billionth of infinite is infinite a
[2:25:05] trillionth infinite a quadrillionth
[2:25:07] googillion of infinite is still infinite
[2:25:11] it's still infinite no matter how many
[2:25:12] times you divide it up you divide it up
[2:25:14] that's why he could take just Five
[2:25:15] Loaves and two fish and just start
[2:25:18] breaking it was infinite it would have
[2:25:22] never failed that's why he could stand
[2:25:24] there and say how many squirrels do you
[2:25:26] have need of today I have need of three
[2:25:29] then tell me exactly where they'll come
[2:25:30] you speak whatever you say why because
[2:25:33] he'd come through the testing and
[2:25:34] through the trying and it wasn't
[2:25:36] something fantastic he was just out
[2:25:40] hunting he was just trying to get back
[2:25:42] to Camp one day trying to get back
[2:25:44] before the snowstorm snowed him in he
[2:25:46] thought I'm not going to make it there
[2:25:47] in time but something touched him on the
[2:25:49] shoulder and said turn around and come
[2:25:51] and walk with
[2:25:52] me he said Lord maybe this is my end and
[2:25:55] he be to walk with the Lord that way it
[2:25:57] wasn't some great big meeting and
[2:25:58] something where happened it was just the
[2:26:01] Simplicity it wasn't a Simplicity of a
[2:26:03] common folk named Haddy Wright that was
[2:26:05] sat there one day and he's being to tell
[2:26:07] her about the squirrels being spoken
[2:26:09] into existence and she said that is
[2:26:10] nothing but the truth and he said the
[2:26:13] she said the right thing and the
[2:26:15] Simplicity of that humble home with her
[2:26:18] boy snickering over in the other room
[2:26:20] and the Holy Spirit come down and said
[2:26:22] say whatever you
[2:26:23] will it'll
[2:26:27] happen in the Simplicity of common
[2:26:30] people God hides
[2:26:35] himself that same logos that was in
[2:26:37] Christ it's in
[2:26:41] you if we could ever just get the
[2:26:45] revelation of exact ly what we
[2:26:48] are brother Bron would say when Divine
[2:26:50] love is projected Sovereign Grace comes
[2:26:53] on the
[2:26:55] scene and brings to pass the projection
[2:26:58] of the Divine
[2:27:00] love that's what we are made to
[2:27:03] be we're made to be projectors of God's
[2:27:08] love that God there's three Greek words
[2:27:10] I'll just close with
[2:27:12] this agapo love Agape Love Is God God's
[2:27:17] Own love agapo love is when that love is
[2:27:22] projected and God projected his love the
[2:27:25] projection of God's love was Jesus
[2:27:27] Christ that in him that that that that
[2:27:31] that God so loved the world that he gave
[2:27:35] his only begotten son was it was a
[2:27:37] projection of the love of God and it
[2:27:40] brought Sovereign Grace on the scene
[2:27:42] what is it by faith you are saved
[2:27:44] through
[2:27:45] Grace it brought the grace of God that
[2:27:48] one projection of Love Brought thousands
[2:27:51] of years of Grace to anyone that would
[2:27:55] believe the power of the love of God and
[2:27:59] now he says I've put that same love in
[2:28:02] you because if you've got the Holy Ghost
[2:28:04] if you've got the lust that little
[2:28:06] portion of God in you you've got a
[2:28:09] portion of agapo
[2:28:12] love the word agapetos is the adjective
[2:28:16] of that same word word that means that
[2:28:17] is the the recipient or the object of
[2:28:22] that love
[2:28:23] projected that's why he could say
[2:28:25] beloved that word beloved is agapetos
[2:28:29] beloved you are now the sons of God
[2:28:32] other words I have projected my love
[2:28:35] down to the world and it came out as his
[2:28:39] attributes in Sons and Daughters of
[2:28:42] God you are the very object of God's
[2:28:45] love and you are to be a reflection or
[2:28:49] an expression of the love of God we're
[2:28:52] not to do the work God's going to do the
[2:28:55] work because when Divine love is
[2:28:58] projected it brings Sovereign Grace on
[2:29:01] the scene not one of us has anything to
[2:29:03] do with Sovereign Grace it's
[2:29:06] him he's the one that has Sovereign
[2:29:08] Grace unmar
[2:29:12] Grace but that we could project love to
[2:29:15] our children project love to our brother
[2:29:17] and sister project love to a
[2:29:20] sinner and it brings the grace of God on
[2:29:23] the
[2:29:23] scene to bring to pass the object of
[2:29:27] that
[2:29:28] love Christ was our example of
[2:29:32] that that he desired that he was sent
[2:29:35] forth into the world so I didn't come
[2:29:36] here to destroy I came to
[2:29:38] save I didn't come here to do away with
[2:29:41] the law I came here to fulfill the
[2:29:43] law I came here so that you could be
[2:29:45] saved
[2:29:47] to give my life for
[2:29:49] you that's our example let's have the
[2:29:52] musicians
[2:29:57] come if we know that song by The Power
[2:30:01] of your love you know that song
[2:30:07] sister love always is looking for
[2:30:09] something to be to be projected
[2:30:15] to
[2:30:20] he would say the same holy
[2:30:22] ghost that saved the
[2:30:25] lutherans the same holy ghost that
[2:30:27] Sanctified the
[2:30:28] methodists that baptized the
[2:30:31] Pentecostals is Now setting in order the
[2:30:34] coming of the Lord Jesus
[2:30:37] Christ when it'll be so powerful that
[2:30:40] body will come into this group a church
[2:30:44] that'll draw the rest of them from the
[2:30:46] grave and there'll be a
[2:30:49] resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost
[2:30:51] is
[2:30:52] for what is the Holy Ghost without us
[2:30:57] they cannot be made perfect they lived
[2:31:00] in one day under that we live in another
[2:31:03] day under this tomorrow Lord will we
[2:31:06] want to speak on Mount Zion what is it
[2:31:08] you are com under Mount Zion that the
[2:31:11] blood of Jesus Christ speaks better
[2:31:13] things than the blood of Abel the blood
[2:31:16] of abble brought condemnation but the
[2:31:18] blood of Jesus Christ brought
[2:31:20] salvation because there is therefore now
[2:31:22] no condemnation to them that are in
[2:31:25] Christ Jesus let's stand to our
[2:31:28] feet Lord I come to

[2:39:05] lot tonight and given you a lot to think
[2:39:07] on knowing there'd be a service in the
[2:39:10] morning bringing you all the way through
[2:39:12] the Life of Christ showing you the
[2:39:15] example that he was to us whether you're
[2:39:17] a young person or an old person whether
[2:39:19] you're middle-aged or wherever you
[2:39:21] consider yourself to be that's
[2:39:23] irrelevant to God what's relevant is
[2:39:26] that in you is a seed in you is a desire

[2:45:29] [Applause]
[2:45:31] me amen that was
[2:45:33] wonderful and I'm only going to talk
[2:45:35] about one thing it was near the end and
[2:45:38] he was talking about in the
[2:45:41] wilderness and I'd already written it
[2:45:43] and then he wrote it and then he said it
[2:45:45] and in the wilderness they were
[2:45:49] surviving why because they weren't in
[2:45:51] the land of promise he said I'll take
[2:45:53] you there I'll get you there safe so all
[2:45:57] they were doing they were walking on
[2:45:59] other people's territory it didn't
[2:46:01] belong to them and God tried to make
[2:46:04] peace all the way through he said you'll
[2:46:06] pay your way you'll do what's right by
[2:46:08] them but if they come after you I'll
[2:46:12] take you through and he did it time and
[2:46:14] time again but I'll tell you what it set
[2:46:17] him up for an appetite to not just
[2:46:20] survive but to start
[2:46:22] overcoming amen that the things that
[2:46:25] have been bothering
[2:46:26] them they got to see a day where those
[2:46:29] were no longer there and he showed it
[2:46:32] with the Egyptians but then he said the
[2:46:34] amorites the jebusites the moabites
[2:46:38] there's battles they won and then they
[2:46:39] went later and they finished the job you
[2:46:42] started it we're going to finish it and
[2:46:45] you know sometimes the problem is that
[2:46:47] we're surviving because we're not in the
[2:46:48] land of promise we're in a place of our
[2:46:50] own choosing we're in a place of our own
[2:46:52] thinking we're in a place of our own
[2:46:54] doing amen and he says if you can get
[2:46:57] into the word if you can find your place
[2:46:59] that's what brother Andrew said if you
[2:47:00] can find your place in the word that's
[2:47:04] when every promise is yours and that's
[2:47:06] when it will happen amen he said how can
[2:47:10] God move you forward if you're not
[2:47:11] living with what he's given you amen
[2:47:14] it's a good time to check up this
[2:47:16] evening Amen to say am I
[2:47:18] surviving because I'm just on the way or
[2:47:22] am in am I in a position to overcome
[2:47:24] because I'm in the land of promise and
[2:47:27] that only comes by the Holy Ghost anden
[2:47:30] if you have the Holy Ghost every promise
[2:47:32] in the book is yours amen let's just
[2:47:36] sing that song this
[2:47:39] evening but you know what he said more
[2:47:41] of you let's sing more of you amen
[2:47:44] because the answer answer is always more
[2:47:45] of him less of me says I've had it all
[2:47:50] tried it all done it all thought it all
[2:47:54] that didn't
[2:47:55] work but when he comes on the scene when
[2:47:58] he's in the house when his word has
[2:48:01] preeminence things work out amen and so
[2:48:04] the answer is never fight more it's get
[2:48:07] more of him get more of his will more of
[2:48:11] his word more of his way more of his
[2:48:12] character more of his thoughts more of
[2:48:15] his nature amen and let the rest of it
[2:48:17] fall Away by the wayside amen let's just
[2:48:20] sing this as a prayer this evening amen
[2:48:23] we've heard the word it was wonderful I
[2:48:25] could preach an hour and never touch the
[2:48:28] high points of what we we heard tonight
[2:48:31] but it's got to be in here and me you
[2:48:33] take what he said tonight what the word
[2:48:35] has said what the Holy Spirit has spoken
[2:48:37] to our lives and each one may be
[2:48:38] something different but you say Lord I
[2:48:41] want that I want what I've heard whether
[2:48:45] as he said you're 60 and you've had a a
[2:48:47] relationship with God for 40 years or
[2:48:49] whether you're
[2:48:50] 14 and you're seeking a greater
[2:48:53] relationship I love what he said it's
[2:48:55] one thing to meet it's another thing to
[2:48:56] know amen I want to know him more and
[2:48:59] more and more and that means I need more
[2:49:02] of him I need more time with him amen
