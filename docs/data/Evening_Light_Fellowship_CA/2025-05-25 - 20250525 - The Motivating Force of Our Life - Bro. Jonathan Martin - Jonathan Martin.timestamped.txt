[35:41] stand and live a
[35:43] testimony
[35:45] clean in the midst of an
[35:48] unbelieving world. Keep looking to the
[35:52] unseen to really
[35:54] know that we will
[35:59] overcome and receive his
[36:03] promise to sit on his
[36:07] throne. I've got to

[37:10] of.
[37:12] One in a
[37:19] million.

[37:48] any
[37:51] merit or any
[37:53] good thing
[37:55] I have done.
[38:00] It's
[38:02] only
[38:04] by
[38:08] his
[38:10] grace, the sovereign grace
[38:14] of my
[38:16] God. For I am
[38:19] one in a million.
[38:27] One in a
[38:31] million
[38:34] more.
[38:36] Oh, what a
[38:40] position. I've
[38:43] received an I
[38:46] call from
[38:49] God. And it's not by
[38:54] any
[38:56] merit or any
[38:58] good thing
[39:00] I have
[39:04] done. It's
[39:08] [Music]
[39:14] only grace.
[39:17] The sovereign grace
[39:20] of my
[39:26] [Music]
[39:32] God is
[39:36] choosing and placing.
[39:39] Why
[39:41] today I stand
[39:44] by his side.
[39:50] [Music]
[41:02] I appreciate your prayers for this. Um,
[41:05] I'm definitely more comfortable on my
[41:09] guitar, but this song is better on the
[41:13] piano and as brother spoke about
[41:15] challenges and today is my challenge. So
[41:18] anybody can pray for me
[41:29] [Music]
[41:35] please. Help me out for you,
[41:39] Lord. When I'm not feeling my
[41:47] best and my body's needing
[41:54] rest, I can wipe away my
[42:01] tears. I can change the atmosphere.
[42:08] When I'm not feeling my
[42:14] best and my body's needing
[42:21] rest, I can wipe away my
[42:28] tears. I can change the atmosphere.
[42:33] [Music]
[42:39] When my heart is
[42:44] overwhelmed and I can't seem to calm
[42:51] myself, if I can just get my mind
[42:57] clear, I can change the atmosphere.
[43:05] When my heart is
[43:07] [Music]
[43:10] overwhelmed and I can't seem to calm
[43:17] myself, if I can just get my mind
[43:21] [Music]
[43:23] clear, I can change the atmosphere.
[43:33] If you're tired of
[43:39] struggling and you need a song to
[43:45] sing, you can turn your sadness to
[43:51] cheer. You can change the atmosphere.
[43:58] So if you're tired of
[44:03] struggling and you need a song to
[44:09] sing, turn your sadness into
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] cheer. You can change the
[44:24] atmosphere. For we are more than
[44:31] conquerors. Jesus told us in his
[44:36] word we can push away all
[44:42] fears. We can change the
[44:45] atmosphere. Help us Lord.
[44:49] But we are more than
[44:53] conquerors. And Jesus told us in his
[44:59] word we can push away all
[45:05] fears. We can change the
[45:08] [Music]
[45:13] atmosphere. Through Christ we have
[45:17] authority. He help us so
[45:19] far. Our praises make the darkness
[45:25] fair. And he promised to be
[45:31] near. So let's change the
[45:36] atmosphere. Through Christ we have
[45:42] authority. Our praises make the darkness
[45:45] flee.
[45:49] and he promised to be
[45:53] near. So let's change the
[45:59] atmosphere. For we are more than
[46:05] conquerors. Jesus told us in his
[46:10] word we can push away our fear.
[46:16] We can change the
[46:21] atmosphere through Christ. We have
[46:26] authority. Our praises make the darkness
[46:32] flee. And he promised to be
[46:38] near. So let's change the atmosphere.
[46:45] Oh Lord, you promise to be
[46:51] near. Help us change the
[46:58] atmosphere.
[46:59] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[47:14] Amen. Praise the
[47:16] Lord. Invite him. He'll come on the
[47:18] scene.
[47:20] When he comes, the enemy goes and
[47:23] changes the atmosphere. Amen. Great
[47:26] songs, two of them. We just enjoyed both
[47:29] of them.

[47:48] find to meet my trials here. Trusting in
[47:52] my father's wise
[47:54] bestowment, I no cause for worry or for
[47:56] fear.
[48:01] Day by
[48:03] day and with each passing
[48:11] moment, strength I
[48:14] find to meet my trials here.
[48:22] trusting
[48:24] in my father's wise
[48:30] bonement. Amen. I've no
[48:35] cause for
[48:37] wor for fear.
[48:43] He whose
[48:45] heart is kind of on me.
[48:59] Hallelujah.
[49:00] Hallelujah.
[49:06] is part of it and
[49:12] pleasure mingling
[49:15] toil with peace and
[49:22] hallelujah. Every
[49:25] day the Lord himself is near. Yes.
[49:31] Hallelujah.
[49:33] With a
[49:35] special mercy for each other.
[49:42] All my
[49:44] cares he f would bear and cheer me. Yes.
[49:51] Amen.
[49:52] He whose
[49:54] name is
[49:57] counselor and
[50:01] power. The
[50:04] protection of his
[50:07] [Music]
[50:11] child is a
[50:13] child. Then on shall be
[50:20] laid. As thy
[50:23] name, thy strength shall be in
[50:30] me. This a
[50:33] pledge to me.
[50:38] Amen. Let's dance. I'll be
[50:42] there in every triulation.
[50:50] Oh, to
[50:52] trust thy
[50:54] promises, oh
[50:58] Lord, that I
[51:01] lose not sweet
[51:05] [Music]
[51:08] consolation offer.
[51:10] Hallelujah.
[51:12] in thy holy
[51:17] word. Help me
[51:20] Lord to
[51:26] draw here to
[51:29] take as from the father's hand.
[51:36] One by
[51:38] one, the days of moments
[51:45] fleeting till I
[51:48] reach the
[51:50] pro land.
[51:53] Amen. Just hold a second. Just hold a
[51:55] second. We're going to I just wanted to
[51:57] say something here about the second
[51:59] verse that
[52:01] uh you know there's a tre tremendous
[52:03] blessing in this uh there isn't the
[52:06] entire song but I just wanted to say
[52:08] that when
[52:10] uh things sometimes get down and we go
[52:13] through a trial remember this that the
[52:18] protection of his child and treasure
[52:21] were a treasure to him. He it's a charge
[52:24] that he took on himself. He didn't give
[52:26] that to anybody else. He said, "I'll be
[52:28] with you and I'll be in you right until
[52:29] the end." What a privilege that is to
[52:32] understand that we are his children and
[52:34] he won't let anything happened to us.
[52:36] And if if something does happen, it's
[52:38] for our own good anyway. You see, we've
[52:41] already won.
[52:44] Doesn't matter. Like I say, we we know
[52:45] the end. We we see the end of the book.
[52:47] We read the last chapter. We know we've
[52:48] won by grace. He'll look after us and
[52:52] he'll guide us through it. He's done it
[52:53] for me. He's done it for all of us. I'm
[52:55] sure. So, I just wanted to say and
[52:58] emphasize that point that we are his
[53:00] treasure and he won't let us fall by
[53:02] grace. Let's sing that as we turn it
[53:06] over to brother John.
[53:12] Amen. The Lord himself is
[53:18] nearing with the
[53:22] special mercy for each
[53:28] child. All my
[53:31] cares he fame would bear and cheer me.
[53:39] He whose
[53:41] name is
[53:43] counselor and
[53:47] power and the
[53:51] protection of his child and
[53:57] treure is a
[54:00] charge that on himself he
[54:06] laid. And as I
[54:09] take thy strength shall be
[54:16] immeasured. This the
[54:19] pledge to me. He
[54:24] made. Amen. Wonderful. Amen. God bless
[54:28] you this morning. Want to greet our
[54:29] visitors. We've got Ethan and Adriana
[54:32] here. We've got Sarah and Leonard here.
[54:33] We've got Brother Abby, Sister Olive
[54:35] here. Amen. Very good to see each one of
[54:38] you. Amen. Good to see sister Kimberly
[54:40] here this morning as well. God bless you
[54:42] and Wesley as well. Amen. We thank the
[54:44] Lord. Amen. For his touch. Amen. I've
[54:47] certainly enjoyed the preaching this
[54:49] weekend. Good to have brother Jonathan
[54:51] Martin here with us. I've enjoyed the
[54:53] specials. Amen. Thank you for your
[54:55] sacrifice. And before service, I was
[54:57] reading Psalm 107 and he said this.
[55:01] David said, "Oh, that men would praise
[55:03] the Lord for his
[55:05] goodness and for his wonderful works to
[55:07] the children of men, for he satisfyth
[55:11] the longing
[55:14] soul and fillth the hungry soul with
[55:18] good things."
[55:21] Verse 20, he said, "He sent his
[55:24] word." He sent his word and healed them
[55:28] and delivered them from their
[55:30] destruction.
[55:32] And then he said, "Then they cry unto
[55:34] the Lord." Verse 28, "In their trouble,
[55:38] and he bringeth them out of their
[55:40] distresses. He maketh the storm a calm,
[55:44] so that the waves thereof are still."
[55:47] Then are they glad because they be
[55:50] quiet. So he bringeth them unto their
[55:54] desired haven.
[55:56] Amen. And then he says, "Oh, that men
[55:58] would praise the Lord for his goodness
[56:01] and for his wonderful works to the
[56:03] children of men." Amen. We've got reason
[56:06] to worship him this morning, don't we?
[56:08] Amen. We're going to sing that song, I
[56:10] worship you, Almighty God, as we turn it
[56:12] over to Brother Jonathan.
[56:14] And it's always the toughest service to
[56:17] preach. It's the end of the weekend. And
[56:19] you know what? If we're honest, we're
[56:20] all tired. It's a good tire, but we're
[56:22] tired. Amen. But let's give everything
[56:25] we've got. We've got a meal prepared for
[56:26] the fellowship afterwards. Let's just
[56:29] let's just enter in body, soul, and
[56:31] spirit this morning. Amen. Let's give
[56:33] everything we've got to the word. Amen.
[56:35] Let's pull on the gift and let's trust
[56:38] God to do something special in each and
[56:40] every one of our lives. If you haven't
[56:41] got what you needed, you say, "Lord, I'm
[56:44] here to get what I need this morning."
[56:45] How do you get it, church? You worship
[56:47] and you praise him before. You thank him
[56:49] before. You go in with a thankful heart
[56:51] and you say, "Lord, I'm trusting you to
[56:52] meet the need this morning." Amen. And
[56:55] we've got a special message this
[56:56] morning. Amen. I'm in great expectation
[56:58] and trusting you are as well. Amen. God
[57:00] bless you. Let's sing
[57:02] this. I
[57:05] worship
[57:06] you
[57:09] almighty
[57:11] God. There is none like you.
[57:18] I
[57:20] worship
[57:21] you, oh prince of
[57:26] peace. That is what I long to
[57:33] do. I give you praise. Hallelujah.
[57:39] Hallelujah. For you are my rightous.
[57:49] I
[57:50] worship
[57:52] you
[57:54] almighty
[57:57] God. There is none like you.
[58:03] Hallelujah. I
[58:05] worship
[58:07] you
[58:10] almighty
[58:12] God. There is none like you.
[58:19] I
[58:20] worship
[58:22] you. The prince of
[58:27] peace that is all my love.
[58:33] [Music]
[58:35] I
[58:35] give you
[58:40] praise for you are my
[58:43] [Music]
[58:52] rightous
[58:55] mighty God.
[58:58] There is none like you.
[59:05] Aren't you glad that you can honestly
[59:08] say that our God is not like any other
[59:11] God?
[59:13] Our God is the living God.
[59:16] There's many gods, thousands upon
[59:18] thousands upon thousands of
[59:21] gods. Anything that is worshiped can be
[59:25] made into a god.
[59:27] But there's only one true living God.
[59:31] And that is the God that proves himself
[59:34] alive.
[59:35] He's the God that knows our hearts. He
[59:38] knows our needs. He knows situations in
[59:41] life. He's the God that promised that he
[59:44] would walk with us and talk with us.
[59:47] He redeemed us for the sole purpose of
[59:50] fellowship because where he is, he wants
[59:53] us to be. That is a powerful truth.
[59:57] That's a powerful
[59:59] revelation that his one desire is where
[1:00:03] I am, you will be also. So he made a way
[1:00:07] for it. And that is through the blood of
[1:00:10] the Lord Jesus Christ. He made a way.
[1:00:13] And then he come back in this uh in this
[1:00:17] hour in spirit form and through his word
[1:00:21] to provide a way that we can have faith
[1:00:24] for the
[1:00:25] rapture. That is a great great thing.
[1:00:28] He's not left us without witness. He's
[1:00:31] not left us without strength. He's not
[1:00:34] left us uh all alone in this dark evil
[1:00:37] age. But God himself has come to us and
[1:00:40] he's revealed himself to us. And it's
[1:00:43] good to be a Christian. It's good to
[1:00:45] know where we stand. It's good to know
[1:00:48] uh it's it's good to be positionally
[1:00:50] placed in the Lord Jesus Christ and and
[1:00:53] to know him and the power of his
[1:00:55] resurrection. You can be seated for just
[1:00:58] a few moments. We want to say again what
[1:01:01] a real honor and privilege it has been
[1:01:04] to be here. It's uh just been a real uh
[1:01:08] delight to minister the word to you and
[1:01:11] uh to just feel your pull and uh the
[1:01:15] desire and love that you have for God
[1:01:18] and his word and uh should I move over
[1:01:21] to this mic? I'm sorry. I I can do that.
[1:01:27] It's uh just uh been a real uh real
[1:01:32] encouragement and and blessing to me uh
[1:01:36] as well just to be here and and feeding
[1:01:38] upon the word of the Lord with you and
[1:01:41] uh God just coming and moving mightily
[1:01:44] and and uh just visiting hearts and
[1:01:47] lives. And I believe that God has
[1:01:50] stepped off of the pages of the Bible
[1:01:52] and just walking the aisles and coming
[1:01:55] and right where you're sitting in the
[1:01:57] pew. And I think that I believe not just
[1:02:00] think, but I believe I know that he's
[1:02:03] still a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:02:05] intents of the heart. And and again, we
[1:02:08] bring uh greetings from our pastor,
[1:02:11] Brother Wayne Lawson. And uh my wife and
[1:02:13] my family brings their greetings as
[1:02:16] well. and and um uh just give give our
[1:02:20] love to you. And uh you know, I I think
[1:02:23] I'm going to try to sing a song
[1:02:46] have to put your fingers in your ears
[1:02:48] and okay, maybe you will.
[1:02:53] But this is a song that
[1:02:56] uh the Lord had given me a few a few
[1:03:00] years back.
[1:03:10] No greater
[1:03:13] love has ever been
[1:03:17] felt than on that
[1:03:21] day. Jesus
[1:03:25] forgave. No sweeter
[1:03:30] voice has ever been
[1:03:34] heard than when he spoke my
[1:03:39] name. I've never been the
[1:03:43] same. You see, I was lost in the
[1:03:48] world. Left bruised, battered, and sore.
[1:03:53] defeated in my
[1:03:56] sin. No strength to rise
[1:04:03] again. The blood of Christ
[1:04:07] remained. Death sin was
[1:04:11] saved. I could go free
[1:04:15] now in Jesus name. Love had
[1:04:21] prevailed. By stripes I
[1:04:26] healed. The weight of sin that held me
[1:04:30] fast and being rolled
[1:04:34] away. There is now
[1:04:38] faith. Confidence in grace.
[1:04:43] The life I once lived is completely
[1:04:51] changed. All because of
[1:04:57] grace. At the
[1:04:59] end only love can
[1:05:03] win. Perfect
[1:05:06] love. It's Christ living
[1:05:11] within his sovereign
[1:05:15] grace, taking the
[1:05:18] place of all the
[1:05:22] hurt, the bitterness and
[1:05:27] pain. The memories of all the sin and
[1:05:33] shame. Of all the days you tried to walk
[1:05:42] away, the blood of Christ
[1:05:46] remains. Death's hand is
[1:05:50] stained. You can go free
[1:05:55] now in Jesus name. Love has
[1:06:01] prevailed. By his stripes you're
[1:06:05] healed. The weight of sin that held you
[1:06:09] fast has been rolled
[1:06:14] away. There is now
[1:06:17] faith. Confidence in
[1:06:21] grace. The life you once lived is
[1:06:27] completely
[1:06:29] changed.
[1:06:31] changed. All because of
[1:06:39] grace. It's all because of
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:45] [Music]
[1:06:53] grace. Amen.
[1:06:58] Aren't you grateful?
[1:07:13] and his grace for our lives. Amen. If
[1:07:17] you have your
[1:07:18] Bibles, we're just going to uh turn to
[1:07:22] Ephesians the 1
[1:07:24] chapter and begin reading from uh verse
[1:07:29] three. And we'll
[1:07:31] uh just go down to the uh 10th
[1:07:36] verse and then we will I would love to
[1:07:39] just read the whole chapter. It's so
[1:07:41] good. But um we're just going to go to
[1:07:45] the 10th verse and then go over to the
[1:07:48] 15th and read down to the 20th
[1:07:55] verse. And then we'll also uh read out
[1:07:59] of
[1:08:00] Colossians the third
[1:08:02] chapter beginning at verse one.
[1:08:07] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[1:08:10] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[1:08:13] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:08:17] places in
[1:08:19] Christ, according as he hath chosen us
[1:08:22] in him before the foundation of the
[1:08:26] world, that we should be holy and
[1:08:28] without blame before him in love, having
[1:08:32] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:08:35] children, by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:08:40] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:08:42] will, to the praise of the glory of his
[1:08:47] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:08:50] in the
[1:08:51] beloved, in whom we have redemption
[1:08:54] through his blood, the forgiveness of
[1:08:58] sins, according to the riches of his
[1:09:01] grace, wherein he hath abounded toward
[1:09:04] us in all wisdom, in prudence, having
[1:09:08] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:09:11] will, according to his good pleasure,
[1:09:14] which he hath purposed in himself, that
[1:09:17] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:09:19] times, he might gather together in one
[1:09:23] all things in Christ, both which are in
[1:09:27] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[1:09:31] him. And now let's just go down to uh
[1:09:34] the 15th verse. Wherefore I also after I
[1:09:38] heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
[1:09:41] and love unto all the saints cease not
[1:09:45] to give thanks for you making mention of
[1:09:47] you in my prayers that the God of our
[1:09:50] Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory
[1:09:54] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:09:56] and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[1:09:59] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:10:02] enlightened, that ye may know what is
[1:10:05] the hope of his calling, and what the
[1:10:08] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:10:11] in the saints, and what is the exceeding
[1:10:14] greatness of his power to usward who
[1:10:16] believe according to the working of his
[1:10:20] mighty power, which he wrought in
[1:10:23] Christ, when he raised him from the
[1:10:25] dead, and set him at his own right hand
[1:10:28] in the heavenly
[1:10:30] places. Now, let's just go over to
[1:10:32] Colossians the third
[1:10:35] chapter. We'll read the first four
[1:10:39] verses.
[1:10:48] If ye then be risen with Christ, seek
[1:10:52] those things which are above, where
[1:10:55] Christ sitth on the right hand of God.
[1:10:59] Set your affection on things above, not
[1:11:03] on things on the earth. For you are
[1:11:05] dead, and your life is hid with Christ
[1:11:09] in God. When Christ who is our life
[1:11:14] shall appear, then shall ye also appear
[1:11:19] with him in glory. When we're reading
[1:11:22] that fourth verse, that word appear
[1:11:26] could be uh in its place could be
[1:11:29] manifested so or revealed. So when
[1:11:33] Christ who is our life shall be
[1:11:36] manifested or shall be revealed then
[1:11:40] shall you also be manifested with him in
[1:11:45] glory. What a great word that is. Now
[1:11:49] just may God add his blessings to the
[1:11:51] reading of the word. You can be seated.
[1:11:56] I would like to take for a text the
[1:11:59] motivating force of our life. We've also
[1:12:04] uh we've often heard uh of motives and
[1:12:10] objectives and we are motivated by
[1:12:13] spirit.
[1:12:15] uh looking looking in the different uh
[1:12:20] such as like maybe the music industry
[1:12:24] uh back in the uh maybe the 50s the 60s
[1:12:28] you had uh Elvis Presley, you had Pat
[1:12:32] Boon and uh then of course all the way
[1:12:35] up to the modern age you've got the
[1:12:38] different uh the different uh you know
[1:12:42] modern uh singers and kings. But I'm
[1:12:47] reminded of how that uh the prophet
[1:12:50] would say that he was in Africa and way
[1:12:54] back in in the jungle and uh someone had
[1:13:00] a a radio and they were listening to uh
[1:13:04] Pat Boon and Elvis Presley and uh they
[1:13:08] were shaking and dancing and doing odd
[1:13:11] things that uh that the uh the natives
[1:13:15] were just looking at them very strange,
[1:13:19] wondering what was taking place. And it
[1:13:22] was because that there was a something
[1:13:25] that was making them do that to act that
[1:13:28] way. And it was because of were
[1:13:32] motivated by spirit and there was
[1:13:36] something that was motivating them to do
[1:13:39] that. And we find that uh the prophet
[1:13:43] would say that your anointing tells on
[1:13:46] you. Whatever your spirit is moves you,
[1:13:50] you're motivated by a spirit. And if the
[1:13:54] spirit of Jesus Christ is on the
[1:13:55] Christian, the believer, no wonder he's
[1:13:58] a peculiar person. There's something
[1:14:02] moving in him. And so we find that every
[1:14:06] nation is made up of of a national
[1:14:10] spirit. You have the uh American spirit.
[1:14:13] You've got a Russian spirit, German
[1:14:16] spirit, a French spirit. You've got a
[1:14:18] Canadian spirit. Uh regardless of where
[1:14:22] you live, there is a spirit that is
[1:14:25] driving that country. And so the
[1:14:28] Americans, they act like Americans. the
[1:14:31] Germans, they act like Germans and and
[1:14:34] so on because it's their national
[1:14:38] spirit. But Christians, we have a
[1:14:41] national spirit and that's the Holy
[1:14:44] Spirit coming from God out of heaven
[1:14:47] that makes us act like that. Uh it it
[1:14:52] makes you conduct yourselves as they do
[1:14:55] up there because you are of another
[1:14:58] world. uh you know as an American I live
[1:15:03] in America and and uh you know I would
[1:15:06] be identified as an American you're
[1:15:09] identified as a Canadian but that's only
[1:15:13] uh our body part our physical uh but the
[1:15:18] soul that conducts us which is our
[1:15:21] character is from above and so we live
[1:15:26] from above as Paul would say that We are
[1:15:30] not born of uh uh the natural the
[1:15:34] earthly Jerusalem uh the natural city
[1:15:38] Jerusalem which was in bondage at that
[1:15:41] time. Uh we're not born of the natural
[1:15:45] but we're born of the heavenly the new
[1:15:48] Jerusalem which is freeborn. And and so
[1:15:53] uh we we conduct ourselves our character
[1:15:57] is not of the natural city but of the
[1:16:01] heavenly city. Uh uh we could take the
[1:16:04] cities the seven church ages and and
[1:16:07] Ephesus and all the way down to the
[1:16:10] leota. And the reason that every church
[1:16:13] age was named after a city because that
[1:16:16] city had a
[1:16:18] particular character of that age. But we
[1:16:23] have come to the leot church age which
[1:16:26] is lukewarm and cold and formal and has
[1:16:31] rejected the spirit of Christ out of the
[1:16:34] church. But we are not identified as
[1:16:38] Leotans. But we are actually identified
[1:16:42] with the heavenly city, the new
[1:16:44] Jerusalem. And that is the city that has
[1:16:47] been prepared for you and I. So the
[1:16:50] prophet would say it like this. It is a
[1:16:53] prepared people for a prepared city.
[1:16:56] Amen. So God is molding our character to
[1:17:01] match that city which is holy,
[1:17:05] righteous, pure. It's perfect in every
[1:17:09] way. So God made a way by the blood to
[1:17:14] perfect us and mold our character
[1:17:17] through trials and through uh great
[1:17:20] adversities. He's molding our character
[1:17:23] to perfectly match that city. Now what
[1:17:27] is motivating us is his holy spirit.
[1:17:32] That's a wonderful thing because Jesus
[1:17:35] would say that uh if if my subjects if I
[1:17:40] was from above he's telling them I'm not
[1:17:42] from above I or I'm not from below I'm
[1:17:46] from above. And he would say that if my
[1:17:49] kingdom was of this world then my
[1:17:52] subjects would fight for me. He says,
[1:17:55] "But my kingdom is not of this world.
[1:17:58] It's from above." And then he would tell
[1:18:02] us that the kingdom of God is not in a
[1:18:06] certain location. Uh if someone comes
[1:18:08] and tells you you need the kingdom of
[1:18:11] God is in America, don't believe them.
[1:18:15] If they try to tell you it's in
[1:18:17] Jeffersonville, don't believe them. If
[1:18:19] they tell you that it's in a it's in a
[1:18:22] another province in Canada, don't
[1:18:25] believe them. Amen. The kingdom of God
[1:18:29] is in you. Isn't that a great
[1:18:32] revelation? Amen. That Jesus was
[1:18:35] imparting to us, the kingdom of God is
[1:18:38] not in a certain location per se in the
[1:18:42] world, but the kingdom of God is in you.
[1:18:45] So wherever you are, you are
[1:18:49] representing another kingdom from
[1:18:52] another world. And now we would find
[1:18:55] that Paul would say in first Corinthians
[1:18:58] the 4th chapter the 20th verse, he would
[1:19:00] say it like this, the kingdom of God is
[1:19:04] God's word made power. What is the
[1:19:07] kingdom of God is within you. The
[1:19:10] kingdom's in you. And when the word
[1:19:14] comes in there, now I'm quoting I'm
[1:19:16] quoting a prophet now. When the word
[1:19:18] comes in there, what does this word
[1:19:21] begin? It turns itself into power,
[1:19:26] making it say just exactly what it said.
[1:19:30] So notice what this power, the Holy
[1:19:33] Ghost is God's power coming into your
[1:19:37] life. And notice what the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:40] going to do. It's going to make you say
[1:19:43] exactly what the word says. Amen. You're
[1:19:47] not going to add to it. You're not going
[1:19:49] to take away from it. But you're going
[1:19:52] to allow the Holy Ghost to shape your
[1:19:56] life and your confession to the word of
[1:19:59] God. You can't say that it says this
[1:20:02] when it really says this and then make
[1:20:06] the word work and live. You've got to
[1:20:10] say the same thing it says. And that
[1:20:14] makes a real confession. Amen. You're
[1:20:17] not trying to polish it up a little bit.
[1:20:19] You're not trying to, you know, add some
[1:20:22] more wisdom to it, but you're saying
[1:20:26] exactly what the word says. Now, isn't
[1:20:29] that what Jesus said? When he, the
[1:20:32] Spirit of truth, comes, he will lead and
[1:20:35] guide you into all truth. Amen. So stay
[1:20:40] with the word. There it is. And it makes
[1:20:45] it power. You see, it'll make it Jesus
[1:20:48] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:20:52] forever. Amen. So when the when the word
[1:20:57] becomes power by the Holy Ghost dwelling
[1:21:00] in you, then everything Jesus was
[1:21:04] yesterday, it will manifest him the same
[1:21:08] today. Amen. Jesus said that he that
[1:21:12] believeth in me, the works that I do
[1:21:15] shall he do also. If you abide in me and
[1:21:19] my word in you, you can ask what you
[1:21:22] will and it shall be done unto you. If
[1:21:25] you abide in me and my word in you, uh
[1:21:30] what it you've got to get with the word,
[1:21:34] get yourself killed out. Now, he's
[1:21:36] showing us the secret to all of this is
[1:21:40] you've got to get with the word and
[1:21:43] you've got to get all of your thoughts
[1:21:46] and all of your ambitions and all of
[1:21:51] your past teachings. You've got to get
[1:21:54] with the word and get yourself killed
[1:21:56] out. Now, that's why the prophet of God
[1:21:59] uh that's why the prophet Paul would say
[1:22:02] that we are washed with the washing of
[1:22:06] the water of the word. It's the pure
[1:22:09] water. It's what separates us from all
[1:22:13] unbelief. It is the truth that washes
[1:22:17] us. Now, now we've all got past. We've
[1:22:20] all got history. We've got I don't care
[1:22:23] if you grew up in this church. You've
[1:22:25] all got something that you've got to be
[1:22:28] washed from. And that is your old man,
[1:22:31] your old nature, your old ideas, the way
[1:22:34] that you want to do things, the way that
[1:22:37] you think things should be done. We've
[1:22:39] all got to get under the washing of the
[1:22:43] word and die out that the word can have
[1:22:47] power in our lives. You see, this is the
[1:22:50] secret of it. He says, "I'm persuaded
[1:22:54] that many of us, friends, have received
[1:22:56] the Holy Ghost, but we just receive
[1:22:59] enough Holy Ghost in us to make us to a
[1:23:03] place where we don't want to lie. We
[1:23:06] don't want to steal. We don't want to do
[1:23:09] anything like that." But God wants to
[1:23:12] feel every fiber of his church. He wants
[1:23:16] to feel your thinking. And he wants to
[1:23:18] feel your mind. He wants to feel every
[1:23:22] bit of you just make you completely
[1:23:25] totally dead to yourself or to your
[1:23:28] thinking. Just so surrendered in God
[1:23:32] till his words just living right through
[1:23:35] you. You don't know nothing else but
[1:23:38] God's word. Just stay right with his
[1:23:40] word. It is life. My words are life,
[1:23:45] said Jesus. And so what is it? The
[1:23:48] kingdom of God is God's word made power.
[1:23:53] Amen. Isn't that a beautiful thing? Was
[1:23:56] Isn't that the desire of the bride of
[1:23:59] Christ in this last day as we have
[1:24:02] moved? Amen. from just church age to
[1:24:06] church age, from message to message to
[1:24:08] message. And now we have come to the
[1:24:11] fullness of the word, the kingdom of God
[1:24:16] made power in your life to overcome
[1:24:20] everything the devil would throw at us.
[1:24:23] It is total surrender to the word and
[1:24:28] agreeing with the word. And that's what
[1:24:31] makes uh the the the word have influence
[1:24:36] in our life. Now you see in this last
[1:24:40] day there is again another people. This
[1:24:44] is so powerful. Now in the last days
[1:24:47] there is again another people in the
[1:24:51] land who under their messenger is the
[1:24:54] final voice to the final age. Now the
[1:24:58] prophet is going to show us now there is
[1:25:01] a church that is their own mouthpiece.
[1:25:03] They're their own voice. God can't use
[1:25:06] them any longer. The word is not having
[1:25:10] effect. It is not having a place or an
[1:25:13] influence in their lives any longer. And
[1:25:16] so they they've rejected the Leodysian
[1:25:19] church age. They have rejected Christ
[1:25:22] out of their midst. But there is another
[1:25:25] group who has followed the word outside
[1:25:29] of denominations, outside of traditions,
[1:25:33] outside of just a creed and a dogma. And
[1:25:37] they have followed him on the outside of
[1:25:39] the camp. And they have met Christ, the
[1:25:42] word, and they have united with the word
[1:25:46] to become the final voice to the final
[1:25:48] age. So there's a church that is their
[1:25:51] own mouthpiece, but there is a bride, a
[1:25:55] church that has moved from just being a
[1:25:57] church, a club, a gathering of people,
[1:26:00] and moved into a spiritual union with
[1:26:04] the word into a marriage. Amen. So we
[1:26:09] are not speaking our own thoughts. We're
[1:26:11] not speaking our own mind, but we're
[1:26:14] speaking his mind because we have
[1:26:17] received his
[1:26:19] influence. Amen. Now, isn't that
[1:26:22] amazing? Because under this influence,
[1:26:25] the doctor can say, "Well, here's the
[1:26:27] report. You've got cancer." But under
[1:26:30] the influence of heaven is the word
[1:26:33] says, "By his stripes, I am healed."
[1:26:37] You see, one influence is of the
[1:26:40] natural, but there's another influence
[1:26:42] that declares by his stripes you are
[1:26:46] healed. So then you've got a choice.
[1:26:49] Which influence are you going to come
[1:26:51] under? Are we going to come under an
[1:26:53] influence, amen, that is continually
[1:26:55] trying to keep us earthbound, trying to
[1:26:58] just keep us under our problems and
[1:27:00] under situations of life? Or are we
[1:27:03] going to be under of another influence
[1:27:06] of the new Jerusalem, calling those
[1:27:08] things that be not as though they
[1:27:11] already are? So one is the influence
[1:27:15] from down below and the other is the
[1:27:17] influence from above. I tell you
[1:27:20] friends, uh man will fail you. Man will
[1:27:23] fail you. We find a young prophet by the
[1:27:26] name of Isaiah and he was under a
[1:27:29] natural influence of the king Uzziah.
[1:27:33] But then we find that King Uzziah, a
[1:27:36] great man, the one of the greatest men
[1:27:38] in history. And yet King Uzziah failed
[1:27:42] God by disbelieving the word and trying
[1:27:46] to take the pro trying to take the the
[1:27:48] place a position that didn't belong to
[1:27:51] him. and he was struck with leprosy. But
[1:27:54] the Bible says that the day that that
[1:27:57] young prophet so discouraged because he
[1:28:01] had been under the influence of that
[1:28:03] king and he had become and he sat at his
[1:28:06] feet and and he was under influence and
[1:28:09] and the strength of that king. But the
[1:28:12] moment that that influence died in his
[1:28:15] life, he saw a vision from above. And
[1:28:20] when the vision was open, he saw the
[1:28:23] true king. And that king took the coals
[1:28:27] from off of the altar and touched his
[1:28:29] lips and burnt up all of the sin. And
[1:28:34] there from that moment on, he become the
[1:28:36] mouthpiece of God. I tell you friends,
[1:28:40] the grace of God that would bring us
[1:28:43] from just a natural influence to a
[1:28:47] heavenly influence that we can be the
[1:28:50] mouthpiece of almighty God. You see,
[1:28:53] Paul would say that we are written
[1:28:57] epistles. Amen. In other words, your
[1:29:01] manifested word. You see, in God's
[1:29:04] chosen place of worship, he would say
[1:29:07] the word that he promised to fulfill in
[1:29:11] the day that you're living in, you will
[1:29:13] be a written epistle of God read of all
[1:29:16] men. Not what you claim, but what God
[1:29:20] does through you will speak out louder
[1:29:23] than anything you could claim. God said,
[1:29:26] "These signs shall follow them that
[1:29:27] believe. That speaks through you." Amen.
[1:29:31] So the mouthpiece is not just totally
[1:29:35] what you're speaking through your lips
[1:29:37] but it is the life that you're living.
[1:29:40] Amen. You see Paul would say that you
[1:29:43] have become my very message that I have
[1:29:47] been preaching. You have become the
[1:29:50] manifested word and everyone around sees
[1:29:54] your life. They see your testimony. They
[1:29:57] they see the way you conduct yourself.
[1:29:59] You're not defeated. You're not victims.
[1:30:01] Uh, amen. But you're overcomers. Well,
[1:30:04] what a testimony for the church of the
[1:30:07] living God in this last day when the
[1:30:09] world wants to just make us victims.
[1:30:12] Always the victims of our of our
[1:30:14] upbringing, the victims of our boss, the
[1:30:17] victims, amen, of the way people view us
[1:30:20] and they hurt our feelings on the
[1:30:22] internet or always trying to make us
[1:30:24] victims. But you see, we are not
[1:30:27] victims. We are the overcomers of this
[1:30:30] Leodysian age. And we have entered into
[1:30:34] his
[1:30:35] domain, into his throne, which is his
[1:30:38] domain, which we have authority over
[1:30:42] every power of the devil because it's
[1:30:46] his kingdom made flesh in you and I.
[1:30:51] So our very testimony is our life. Amen.
[1:30:56] The way we talk, the way we walk, the
[1:30:58] way we view things, it's it's our
[1:31:01] testimony. You see, the prophet would
[1:31:03] tell us about a slave that had come from
[1:31:06] Africa and and he was sold into slavery
[1:31:08] and there was hundreds of slaves here in
[1:31:12] this, you know, in this plantation and
[1:31:15] and there was a slave buyer that that
[1:31:18] came by this plantation wanting to buy
[1:31:21] slaves. a a very very sad part of our
[1:31:26] American history. Amen. A sad thing. But
[1:31:29] but nonetheless, it took place. And here
[1:31:32] was a man that that that that he's
[1:31:35] looking over the slaves and he's wanting
[1:31:38] to buy some slaves. And he sees he sees
[1:31:42] all of the slaves under the toil and the
[1:31:46] burden and of slavery. and their their
[1:31:49] head is down and their shoulders are
[1:31:51] bent are stooped and and they're just
[1:31:54] going through the motions of their work.
[1:31:57] Amen. But there was another man that had
[1:32:00] his chest sticking out, his shoulders
[1:32:01] back, his head held high. Amen. And he
[1:32:05] was going about his work with a a a very
[1:32:08] positive atmosphere. And this and the
[1:32:11] and the and the slave buyer said, "Well,
[1:32:14] I want to buy that slave." And the and
[1:32:17] the owner said, "No, he's not for sale."
[1:32:21] Amen. He says, "Well, well, what what
[1:32:23] what makes him so different? Do you feed
[1:32:27] him different?" "No, I don't feed him
[1:32:29] different." "Well, do you put him in
[1:32:31] different headquarters? Is is he the
[1:32:33] boss over all the slaves?" "No, that's
[1:32:36] not the case." He said, "Well, then what
[1:32:38] makes him so different?" He said, "Well,
[1:32:41] I wondered that myself." He said, "And I
[1:32:44] begin to do some research and I find out
[1:32:46] that he come from a certain certain
[1:32:49] tribe in Africa and he and his father is
[1:32:53] the king of that tribe. And though he is
[1:32:56] in a foreign country as a slave, he
[1:33:00] knows that he is the the the son of a
[1:33:04] king. So he conducts himself that way.
[1:33:07] Oh my. If that could take place in the
[1:33:10] natural, amen, that he couldn't be
[1:33:12] bought. He couldn't He would He refused,
[1:33:15] Amen. to to knock down to the devil,
[1:33:18] then what about true bornagain, Holy
[1:33:21] Ghost fililled sons and daughtershu that
[1:33:24] is under the influence of that new
[1:33:27] Jerusalem? Uh we come from above. We
[1:33:30] come from God. We're going back to God.
[1:33:33] Then we refuse uh to give place to the
[1:33:36] devil. Our thoughts is on heavenly
[1:33:38] things. Uh our confession uh is a
[1:33:41] heavenly confession. Uh we are redeemed
[1:33:44] uh by the blood of God. Uh we are not
[1:33:47] slaves to sin any longer. But we are
[1:33:50] freeborn sons and daughters of God. Uh
[1:33:53] I'm not what I used to be. I am no
[1:33:56] longer an alcoholic. I'm no longer a
[1:33:59] cigarette smoker. I am no longer just a
[1:34:02] cold lukewarm church member. I am
[1:34:06] redhot, full of the power of the Holy
[1:34:09] Ghost, looking for the coming of the
[1:34:11] Lord. Any second, any day, I'm under the
[1:34:15] influence of the power of the Holy
[1:34:22] Ghost. It grips me, you see. Amen. We're
[1:34:27] all under an
[1:34:29] influence. Amen. Regardless, we all are
[1:34:32] made of a spirit. And if you don't have
[1:34:35] spirit, you're
[1:34:36] dead. Amen. So it it doesn't matter.
[1:34:39] Every home is controlled by spirit. Your
[1:34:43] home uh we're all Christians, but I may
[1:34:47] raise my children just a little bit
[1:34:49] different than you raise your children.
[1:34:52] I I may set at my table just a little
[1:34:54] bit different than you sit at your
[1:34:55] table. My wife may go about preparing
[1:34:58] food just a little bit different than
[1:35:00] you prepare your food. Amen. is because
[1:35:04] we are all controlled by spirit. Amen.
[1:35:07] So we we're we're all different. And yet
[1:35:10] God puts us all together as a many
[1:35:14] membered body. And without you, I can't
[1:35:18] make the rapture. And I hate to tell
[1:35:20] you, but without me, you're not going to
[1:35:22] make the rapture. We need one another.
[1:35:24] We need one another's influence. We need
[1:35:26] one another's strength and
[1:35:28] encouragement. That's why the Holy Ghost
[1:35:30] put us into one body. Not clicks, not
[1:35:35] separating ourselves, uh, but he filled
[1:35:38] our hearts with love. And every member
[1:35:41] of the body is supplying the need of the
[1:35:45] other. No clicks in the body, just love.
[1:35:49] the influence of perfect love driving us
[1:35:53] together because we realize uh we are
[1:35:57] every one of us under the influence of
[1:36:00] heaven.
[1:36:04] You've got what I need. I've got what
[1:36:06] you need. And and you got what they
[1:36:08] need. and every one of us. And how the
[1:36:11] devil tries to drive wedges between us,
[1:36:15] tries to separate brotherhood, tries to
[1:36:17] bring little hurts and little ill
[1:36:19] feelings. It's the devil, friends, uh
[1:36:23] that is trying to influence and motivate
[1:36:25] your life. But the power of God uh will
[1:36:28] motivate you to ask for forgiveness.
[1:36:32] Make that thing right. You can't stand
[1:36:34] it when you know that you've hurt
[1:36:36] someone. It's because your spirit is of
[1:36:40] another spirit, the Holy
[1:36:44] Ghost. Now, you still got a human
[1:36:47] spirit. And that human spirit will get
[1:36:49] stubborn against the Holy Spirit. And
[1:36:52] that human spirit says, "I don't want to
[1:36:54] do it. They're the ones that hurt me."
[1:36:58] And they get stubborn and try to But the
[1:37:00] Holy Ghost will make you so
[1:37:02] miserable. You can't hardly eat. You
[1:37:05] can't hardly sleep at night. You can't
[1:37:07] hardly do your work. You're miserable.
[1:37:10] That's why you get
[1:37:12] cranky. That's why you start developing
[1:37:15] a bitter spirit. It's because you're
[1:37:19] miserable. But what what what the Holy
[1:37:21] Ghost is really asking for you to do is
[1:37:23] humble yourself. Submit to the word. Be
[1:37:26] washed with the word and say, "I know
[1:37:28] how to make this right." Uh you may have
[1:37:31] not done it but you know to make that
[1:37:33] right and make your spirit right you've
[1:37:35] got to go ask for forgiveness. Friends
[1:37:38] uh we have come to headship. This word
[1:37:41] is supreme authority over our lives. Uh
[1:37:44] and the and every one of us from the
[1:37:47] pastor to the deacon to the trustee to
[1:37:49] the officers to the musicians to the to
[1:37:51] the to the leoty every one of us is
[1:37:54] under the uh influence of the Holy
[1:37:58] Ghost.
[1:38:00] headship, the vindicated
[1:38:03] word. Now, the prophet of God would say
[1:38:07] it like this. He
[1:38:09] says he's, you know, he wasn't your
[1:38:11] typical preacher. He's a
[1:38:14] prophet. And so, he would have ministers
[1:38:16] all around him and they got their some
[1:38:19] of them's got their collars turned
[1:38:20] around backwards. They've been to
[1:38:22] seminaries and they're great theologians
[1:38:24] and they can say their words just
[1:38:26] perfectly. And so the prophet of God
[1:38:29] would stand there with maybe even a
[1:38:31] little bit of a complex saying, "I I'm
[1:38:33] not a preacher. I'm a spare wheel."
[1:38:36] Amen. I'm just a spare tire. I in in in
[1:38:40] the presence of these great men, they're
[1:38:41] preachers. I'm not really a preacher.
[1:38:44] And yet a prophet to the age. But the
[1:38:47] prophet of God would say like this. He
[1:38:50] says, 'I'm not a preacher, but it's made
[1:38:52] up in a spiritual form of watching
[1:38:55] things and seeing things move and
[1:38:58] forewarning people of things that come
[1:39:00] to pass. It's that's my makeup. I can't
[1:39:04] help that no more than you can help your
[1:39:06] makeup. But God has put us each one in
[1:39:09] the body to do certain things. And I
[1:39:12] watch every little move, every
[1:39:14] objective, every motive because
[1:39:17] everything is governed by spirit. This
[1:39:20] church was put here for a purpose. There
[1:39:23] is a spirit behind this church. Amen.
[1:39:26] Just just hearing the different
[1:39:28] testimonies uh uh of of just your labor
[1:39:32] of love through the years, I begin to
[1:39:34] think of this where this church is made
[1:39:37] up is here for a purpose.
[1:39:41] I know the devil tries to get us lax and
[1:39:44] maybe our purpose was years ago. Let me
[1:39:46] tell you something. You've not outrun
[1:39:48] your purpose. God still got you here.
[1:39:52] God moved you from a little building
[1:39:53] that you could barely even move around
[1:39:56] in to a building like this because
[1:39:58] you've got purpose. Hallelujah. You made
[1:40:02] the transition and the move because we
[1:40:04] are a people of vision. I hope it's all
[1:40:07] right, but it's just burning my soul.
[1:40:10] Don't you for don't you don't don't
[1:40:12] forget about your lost loved ones. Don't
[1:40:15] forget about the drunk on the street.
[1:40:17] Don't forget about that person that's
[1:40:19] that you're working with. They may be
[1:40:21] wanting to blow their brains out and
[1:40:23] you're the only gospel they'll ever
[1:40:27] hear. Don't forget your purpose. Don't
[1:40:30] forget what's motivating your life.
[1:40:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank God for all the
[1:40:37] years, but you're still here.
[1:40:42] Hallelujah. We don't have a us for no
[1:40:46] more mentality. I I I'm not preaching at
[1:40:48] you. I'm encouraging you. I'm telling
[1:40:50] you that I know that's not your
[1:40:52] attitude. I've heard you. I know your
[1:40:54] spirit. There's a desire to see lost
[1:40:57] souls saved. I say God has placed you
[1:40:59] here for such a time as this. I say God
[1:41:03] has put you here. God's given you a crop
[1:41:05] of young people for such a time as this.
[1:41:08] I say there's nothing impossible for
[1:41:10] God. God can raise up rocks to praise
[1:41:13] him. God can fill these pews as long as
[1:41:16] you stay motivated by the power of God
[1:41:19] to be a witness and an outreach in this
[1:41:23] community. Well, I hope that was all
[1:41:26] right. It's free of
[1:41:29] charge. This church was put here for a
[1:41:31] purpose. There is a spirit behind this
[1:41:34] church. There's a spirit behind your
[1:41:37] home, behind every building, behind
[1:41:39] everything. There is a spirit motive and
[1:41:42] objective. This church comes here to
[1:41:44] greatly exalt some human system or
[1:41:46] something. Then its motives is not
[1:41:49] right. But it's put here to try to
[1:41:51] achieve something for the kingdom of
[1:41:53] God. Then the motive and objective both
[1:41:55] is right. If the motives is directed
[1:41:58] that
[1:41:59] way, you see the church for years and
[1:42:03] years and years has been under the
[1:42:07] influence of man and they've been under
[1:42:10] the wrong
[1:42:11] motive. There's been a lot of selfish
[1:42:14] motives. all of the revivals
[1:42:18] uh just revival of great great moves of
[1:42:21] God in the in the in the 40s and the 50s
[1:42:24] and and and but when it come to the
[1:42:27] opening of the seals, the prophet of God
[1:42:29] says there's the bride's not even had a
[1:42:31] revival yet. He says we've had
[1:42:34] denominational revivals to just fill up
[1:42:37] pews, but we've not had any anything to
[1:42:41] really stir the bride yet. You see what
[1:42:44] he was showing us is under the first two
[1:42:47] pools which was healing and prophecy
[1:42:50] there was there was thousands blind eyes
[1:42:53] were being opened, deaf ears were being
[1:42:55] stopped. The the the the lame were
[1:42:58] walking. The dead was being raised and
[1:43:01] yet there was no real true spirit to
[1:43:05] motivate the church yet. It was because
[1:43:09] they just went right back where they
[1:43:11] come from. Many of them did. They just
[1:43:13] went right back under the denomination.
[1:43:15] They filled up the pews. And the prophet
[1:43:17] of God says, "We've had denominational
[1:43:19] revivals." He says, "That's why when you
[1:43:22] hear them, they're praying. They're
[1:43:24] they're putting they're they're they're
[1:43:26] publishing in their magazines. It's not
[1:43:28] too late. Fast, pray, cry, fast, pray,
[1:43:32] cry. We need a real awakening." That's
[1:43:35] amazing that the prophet is identifying
[1:43:37] this in the 60s after the awakening of
[1:43:40] the bride. He says the problem is
[1:43:42] they've not recognized the awakening of
[1:43:45] the bride which took place at the
[1:43:48] opening of the
[1:43:49] seals. That's what the bride's revival
[1:43:52] is all about. The words and the spirit
[1:43:55] always accompanies the words.
[1:43:58] Hallelujah. So the spirit by the word
[1:44:02] motivates our life.
[1:44:05] We don't shout just because someone eyes
[1:44:08] are open. We rejoice. We shout. Don't
[1:44:10] get me wrong, but regardless of whether
[1:44:14] we see the blind eyes open, whether we
[1:44:16] see the dead raised, we are motivated to
[1:44:20] praise God as if it already is happening
[1:44:23] because the word says
[1:44:27] so. It's a bride's
[1:44:30] revival. Now, it's amazing because in
[1:44:33] the in the United States, it's almost a
[1:44:37] repeat of history that you can hear our
[1:44:40] radios and they're saying the exact same
[1:44:42] thing. It's not too late for America.
[1:44:45] Fast, pray, cry, fast, pray. It's not
[1:44:50] too late. And we're living in
[1:44:52] 2025. They're looking for a great
[1:44:55] awakening. What is it? They missed their
[1:44:59] visitation.
[1:45:01] They missed their hour when the mighty
[1:45:04] angel which is the Lord himself and Paul
[1:45:08] said that the Lord 1 Corinthians the
[1:45:10] third chapter the Lord is that
[1:45:14] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:45:16] is there is
[1:45:18] liberty and when the mighty angel which
[1:45:21] was the Lord himself descended he
[1:45:25] brought liberty to the church. The word
[1:45:28] does not come to bind you. The word
[1:45:31] comes to liberate you.
[1:45:35] Hallelujah.
[1:45:37] So look what Paul would say. You've he
[1:45:40] says now there's certain men coming in
[1:45:41] unawares. They're creeping into the
[1:45:43] church and they're spying out your
[1:45:45] liberty and they're trying to take away
[1:45:47] your liberty to just make you cold and
[1:45:49] formal. But the church, the real true
[1:45:53] bride of Christ,
[1:45:55] refuses to knock to to be motivated by
[1:45:59] any other spirit contrary to the spirit
[1:46:02] of the
[1:46:06] Lord because they find themselves they
[1:46:10] find their names written in that word
[1:46:13] and they see that they're
[1:46:15] redeemed. They see that there's grace
[1:46:18] upon their lives. is placing them. The
[1:46:21] message of the hour is positionally
[1:46:23] placing you. Hallelujah. Amen. The Holy
[1:46:27] Ghost is not our adoption. The message
[1:46:30] came to place a Holy Ghost fililled
[1:46:33] church. Ain't that beautiful? Amen. This
[1:46:36] is this is what the eyes of our
[1:46:38] understanding is coming open that the
[1:46:41] mystery of his will is to adopt you not
[1:46:45] as a defeated church but as a victorious
[1:46:49] church. And as we surrender to the
[1:46:52] headship of the word, it's moving us
[1:46:54] into position that whatever you bind on
[1:46:57] earth will be bound in heaven. Whatever
[1:46:59] you loose on earth will be loosed in
[1:47:01] heaven. It's a people of authority.
[1:47:06] something that's motivating us. You see
[1:47:11] to motive to mo uh
[1:47:14] motive is a reason for doing
[1:47:18] something. Now that's the meaning of it.
[1:47:21] It's a reason for doing something. It
[1:47:24] also means when you go back to the old
[1:47:26] old language, the original it means to
[1:47:30] move.
[1:47:32] Now, I don't I probably don't have to
[1:47:35] tell you, but when I read that, I just
[1:47:37] started shouting a little bit because
[1:47:40] immediately I went to what a prophet
[1:47:42] said and says, "Some of you people that
[1:47:45] really believe this to be the truth that
[1:47:47] we're entering another age. We're
[1:47:50] entering the raptured age." You know,
[1:47:53] the church can't go in its condition and
[1:47:55] it can't get any better. It must get
[1:47:58] worse. It's got to be something. And
[1:48:02] it's moving right now, friend. It's on.
[1:48:06] The move is on for the bride. That's the
[1:48:10] truth. That's thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:48:13] That's in the invisible union in 65. So
[1:48:16] the prophet of God is showing us what
[1:48:18] we've been waiting for to move us is
[1:48:22] moving now.
[1:48:25] So the prophet says the reason they're
[1:48:27] missing their revival is they're always
[1:48:29] putting it off in the future and saying
[1:48:32] it's coming in the future. And the
[1:48:33] prophet of God says we are entering the
[1:48:36] raptured age. The move is on for the
[1:48:41] bride, thus saith the
[1:48:44] Lord. So the very thing that this bride
[1:48:46] has been waiting for to motivate her
[1:48:49] life is moving now. Not future. It's
[1:48:52] already been in action.
[1:48:56] So what is it? The bride has been moved
[1:49:00] under the original
[1:49:01] headship. This bride has thus saith the
[1:49:05] Lord or she stands still. And the move
[1:49:08] is on for the bride. Thus saith the
[1:49:12] Lord. Amen. Then what's motivating your
[1:49:16] life? You see, to
[1:49:19] motivate is to provide someone with a
[1:49:22] motive for doing
[1:49:24] something. Now, I'm getting ready to get
[1:49:26] to a spot again where I started shouting
[1:49:29] because the prophet says, "Amen." Or or
[1:49:31] or I'm just reading the definition here
[1:49:34] to provide someone with a
[1:49:37] motive. So, the bride was waiting for a
[1:49:40] motive to
[1:49:44] move. Amen. just another denomination
[1:49:47] wasn't making this bride move. Just to
[1:49:50] make her to move from a Baptist to being
[1:49:52] a Pentecostal, from a Pentecostal back
[1:49:54] to being a Presbyterian, it wasn't good
[1:49:56] enough for the bride to make the move.
[1:49:59] There was nothing going to move this
[1:50:01] bride into the rapture under that
[1:50:04] influence. But you see, a man, God, rich
[1:50:09] in his mercy, opened the word to
[1:50:11] motivate. He provided grace to motivate
[1:50:15] us to begin to move. In other words,
[1:50:18] it's like this to motivate also means to
[1:50:23] stimulate. To stimulate someone's
[1:50:25] interest in or enthusiasm for doing
[1:50:30] something.
[1:50:32] Hallelujah. You see, there
[1:50:35] was 120 in the upper room.
[1:50:39] All because God or Jesus gave a promise
[1:50:44] that God the Father was going to fulfill
[1:50:47] the promise in their lives. He says, "So
[1:50:50] go wait for the promise. Go Terry for
[1:50:52] the promise of the father." So there
[1:50:54] they are now. They're motivated. They've
[1:50:58] moved. And look, they're scared for
[1:51:01] their lives.
[1:51:03] They're all sitting there maybe got the
[1:51:05] got the shades all covered over with
[1:51:07] blankets or what have you. They're
[1:51:10] they're they're scared of the Jews. The
[1:51:12] Messiah has been killed, resurrected.
[1:51:15] Now he's ascended and now they're all
[1:51:17] scared. But on the 10th day when the day
[1:51:20] of Pentecost was fully come, there come
[1:51:22] a sound from heaven like a rushing
[1:51:24] mighty wind and it stimulated
[1:51:28] them. What stimulated them? They knew
[1:51:32] the prophecy of Joel 2 was fulfilled in
[1:51:35] their life. So Peter can say they're not
[1:51:39] drunk as you suppose, but we are
[1:51:43] stimulated because this is that which
[1:51:46] the prophet Joel prophesied, I will pour
[1:51:48] out my spirit upon all flesh. So when
[1:51:51] they seen the prophecy made manifest, it
[1:51:54] stimulated them to go into
[1:51:59] action. And under that
[1:52:03] enthusiasm, 3,000 gave their souls to
[1:52:08] God. Isn't that
[1:52:12] good? So something is always motivating
[1:52:16] us. You see what motivates me? Questions
[1:52:20] and answers 64. What motivates me? What
[1:52:22] is this strength in my arm? It certainly
[1:52:25] is not my muscle. It's my spirit.
[1:52:28] Certainly take that spirit out and
[1:52:30] what's the muscle going to do? It's as
[1:52:32] dead as it can be. It'll rot. It's the
[1:52:36] spirit that strengths. Look at little
[1:52:39] Samson. A lot of them seen doors look
[1:52:42] like it been between these two post
[1:52:45] here. Why a man that big could take up a
[1:52:48] line and tear him to pieces. A lion
[1:52:50] jumping a man like that with door with
[1:52:52] shoulders like a barn door. Why sure
[1:52:53] that wouldn't be no mystery. But the
[1:52:55] mystery was he was just a little
[1:52:58] curlyheaded shrimp. Little bitty old
[1:53:00] guy. Little
[1:53:03] The prophet just knows how to
[1:53:05] just put it real plain, doesn't
[1:53:09] he? He's He's a He's a curlyheaded
[1:53:12] shrimp. Little bitty old guy. Little
[1:53:14] Little mama's boy. Oh, wouldn't
[1:53:17] that offend us? Someone called us a
[1:53:19] mama's boy. No man wants to be
[1:53:22] identified as a mama's boy. And the
[1:53:24] prophet of God is making it real clear.
[1:53:26] He's just a little guy. There's nothing
[1:53:28] great about him. He's a little
[1:53:30] He's a little mama's
[1:53:32] boy. Amen. Seven little curls
[1:53:36] hanging down his back. But you notice he
[1:53:38] was just as helpless as anything until
[1:53:40] the spirit of the Lord come upon him.
[1:53:42] And when the spirit of the Lord come
[1:53:44] upon him, that lion run out and grow. He
[1:53:47] just tore him to pieces. It wasn't
[1:53:49] Samson. It was the spirit of the
[1:53:52] Lord. Why didn't Samson run? The same
[1:53:56] reason you're not
[1:53:58] running. You say, "Me? You're trying to
[1:54:01] make a link between me and Samson?
[1:54:03] tearing a destroying a lion, killing and
[1:54:05] and and yes, the same spirit that
[1:54:10] refuses you to lay down for some laya
[1:54:13] spirit. The same spirit that refuses to
[1:54:17] just have a good shouting service and
[1:54:19] and speak in tongues and dance a little
[1:54:22] bit and then go right back into the
[1:54:24] world. the same spirit that brings you
[1:54:27] into the headship of the word and says,
[1:54:30] "Oh God, I surrender my ideas. I
[1:54:33] surrender my will. I lay down my rights.
[1:54:36] I want you to take all of me and I want
[1:54:38] you to place me in this raptured age and
[1:54:42] move me into the chains of my
[1:54:47] body." Something something is breaking
[1:54:50] the strongholds of sin in your life.
[1:54:53] It's because he's claimed you for this
[1:54:59] work. I don't know. Let me just say it
[1:55:01] like this. I don't know if you realize
[1:55:02] it or not, but it is your confession in
[1:55:05] your life that is going to raise up
[1:55:08] those that are sleeping in the graves.
[1:55:12] Your confession, your life, what you are
[1:55:14] manifesting, the faith that you're
[1:55:16] manifesting in this word is what's going
[1:55:19] to raise Paul, Peter, Iranius, Martin
[1:55:23] Luther, all of them, your mama, your
[1:55:26] daddy, my grandma, whoever it may be
[1:55:29] that went into the grave believing in
[1:55:31] the Lord Jesus Christ, a part of this
[1:55:34] bride body, they're going to raise from
[1:55:35] the dead. It's going to be your life
[1:55:38] that is streaming out that I believe
[1:55:42] this word. I believe it with all of my
[1:55:45] heart. Something motivating you to say I
[1:55:51] believe. You may not understand
[1:55:53] everything, but you know it's the truth.
[1:55:55] You're not trying to make the puzzle fit
[1:55:57] necessarily because you you you may not
[1:55:59] even have all the knowhow to do it, but
[1:56:02] you believe it nonetheless.
[1:56:07] You see, when Christ who is our life
[1:56:10] shall appear, we shall appear with
[1:56:14] him. Hallelujah. Amen. In Luke
[1:56:19] 17:30. Amen. As it was in the days of
[1:56:21] Noah and as it was in the days of Lot,
[1:56:23] so shall it be in the appearing of the
[1:56:26] son of man. When the son of man is
[1:56:29] revealed. Hallelujah. In other words,
[1:56:32] when God is revealed in the last days
[1:56:37] when we see it as the days of Noah when
[1:56:41] they're eating and drinking and giving a
[1:56:43] marriage and having a good frolic
[1:56:46] parting time and then we see as it was
[1:56:49] in the days of Lot homosexuality and men
[1:56:52] with men and women with women and the
[1:56:54] filth and the and the and the and the
[1:56:56] sodomy conditions that is in this age.
[1:56:59] When you see the
[1:57:01] condition, look
[1:57:03] up for your redemption has drawing
[1:57:07] nigh. What is your redemption? It is the
[1:57:11] when
[1:57:12] God who died for our sins, who purged us
[1:57:17] from all of our
[1:57:19] unrighteousness, but comes again in the
[1:57:22] last days and comes with a claiming word
[1:57:26] and says, "I claim your body. You're the
[1:57:28] person that I redeemed. I paid the price
[1:57:31] for you. You don't belong to the devil.
[1:57:33] You don't belong to homosexuality. You
[1:57:36] don't belong to cigarettes or alcohol or
[1:57:38] some filthy pornography or whatever. You
[1:57:41] belong to me.
[1:57:46] When we see him appear
[1:57:49] to take a hold of your life, that's when
[1:57:52] you who are a part of his mind from the
[1:57:55] beginning of the world before the
[1:57:57] foundation of the world comes into
[1:57:59] manifestation.
[1:58:02] Hallelujah.
[1:58:04] Hallelujah. I I I've hit it for two
[1:58:06] services. Might as well hit it for a
[1:58:08] third. Remember, you're a gene.
[1:58:12] The only way that you could get here in
[1:58:13] the physical is you had to be a part of
[1:58:15] your daddy's life. You're a part of his
[1:58:19] gene. You're a germ of his life. So then
[1:58:22] that germ is coming into physical
[1:58:25] manifestation. You were there the whole
[1:58:27] time, but your daddy couldn't fellowship
[1:58:29] with you. Your daddy couldn't have a
[1:58:31] relationship with you. Even though you
[1:58:33] were there in germ form, but then
[1:58:35] through the bedding ground of your mama,
[1:58:37] you come into manifestation. And then
[1:58:39] you begin to grow and you begin to come
[1:58:41] into the knowledge of who you are as a
[1:58:44] son and you're growing and growing and
[1:58:46] your faculties are growing and then you
[1:58:48] come into position where daddy is not
[1:58:50] looking at you as just a teenager any
[1:58:52] longer. He can actually have a
[1:58:54] fellowship, a conversation from a grown
[1:58:56] man to a grown
[1:58:58] man. Well, the same thing has taken
[1:59:00] place in the spiritual because we were a
[1:59:03] part of God's eternal life. And God is
[1:59:06] eternal. He has no beginning and he has
[1:59:09] no ending. So you were a part of his
[1:59:12] eternal gene germ of life and God was
[1:59:15] waiting for this day for you to come
[1:59:18] into manifestation. And then God has
[1:59:20] raised this church until now we are of
[1:59:24] age that we can take the word with
[1:59:27] understanding and actually talk with God
[1:59:30] as friends.
[1:59:33] Hallelujah. Not as someone that is just
[1:59:37] a bastard child who can't take
[1:59:40] correction, but we have been corrected
[1:59:42] by the word and we have come into
[1:59:44] perfect fellowship with God by his
[1:59:46] blood. And now we are
[1:59:49] mature, a mature
[1:59:54] bride. I'm I'm I know you think I'm a
[1:59:57] nut. Maybe I am. I'm motivated.
[2:00:02] I I I want to do a
[2:00:07] backflip. Never done one in my life. I'd
[2:00:09] hurt myself. But I feel like it. Oh, I
[2:00:12] feel good because I see who I am. I see
[2:00:16] myself in this book. I see myself in
[2:00:18] every type and shadow. I see that Rahab
[2:00:21] was a harlot. But yes, she was a
[2:00:24] predestinated seed behind those walls
[2:00:27] that were keeping her captive. They just
[2:00:29] needed a Joshua to tear down those
[2:00:32] walls.
[2:00:35] And then she come to herself. And then
[2:00:38] she become married to a general, an
[2:00:40] Israeli general. And she was no longer
[2:00:43] Rahab the harlot. She was Rahab the
[2:00:46] mighty general's wife.
[2:00:50] I tell you friends, we are not the bride
[2:00:52] of Satan. We are not the bride of Leosa.
[2:00:55] We are not a harlot. We are not a part
[2:00:57] of those denominational heartless
[2:00:58] systems. We are the bride of Jesus
[2:01:02] Christ, spotless, pure, holy, without
[2:01:06] fault, ready for the coming of the
[2:01:12] Lord. It's because he claimed
[2:01:15] you. You would never be able to believe
[2:01:17] this, but he claimed you for
[2:01:19] it. And he said, "You're the one that I
[2:01:23] paid the price for. Come unto me all ye
[2:01:26] that are weary and heavy laden and now
[2:01:27] I'll give you
[2:01:28] rest. For Christ indeed is the life.
[2:01:33] He's quoting the scripture now. Christ
[2:01:35] who is our life. For Christ indeed is
[2:01:36] the life of the church. He has no other
[2:01:39] life. Without him she is simply a
[2:01:42] religious society, a club, a meaningless
[2:01:44] gathering of the people. As a corpse,
[2:01:46] bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse.
[2:01:49] So the church, no matter what her
[2:01:51] programs and her gracious efforts might
[2:01:54] achieve, without Christ, she is a corpse
[2:01:57] also. But with him in her midst, with
[2:02:01] him motivating her, she becomes to the
[2:02:03] wonderment of all his body, the fullness
[2:02:07] of him that filth all in
[2:02:15] all. You say, "I'm unworthy.
[2:02:19] How can I the fullness of him that filth
[2:02:22] all in all? You mean as when the word
[2:02:26] was made
[2:02:27] flesh and Peter said in I believe first
[2:02:31] or second Timothy the third chapter said
[2:02:32] the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in him
[2:02:35] bodily. In other words, all that God was
[2:02:39] was poured into that one
[2:02:41] man. It was God walking in flesh.
[2:02:45] It was God
[2:02:46] eating, drinking,
[2:02:50] hearing, bringing his senses under
[2:02:52] subjection to the word that when the
[2:02:55] devil tried to get him all out of
[2:02:57] balance, he stood there and said, "But
[2:02:58] it's written, Satan. It's written,
[2:03:01] Satan." He surrendered himself to the
[2:03:04] authority and headship of the word and
[2:03:06] he overcome by it.
[2:03:09] You
[2:03:10] see, Satan tries to get us
[2:03:15] so so messed up in our
[2:03:18] theology. And that's why brother
[2:03:20] Brandham says, "I I didn't come to
[2:03:21] correct anyone." He said, "I I just come
[2:03:24] to straighten things. I just tried to
[2:03:26] straighten it up." He said, "You're not
[2:03:28] going to become a son. You are a
[2:03:31] son." He goes, "I'm not trying to step
[2:03:33] on anyone's toes. I'm just trying to let
[2:03:36] you know who you are.
[2:03:41] And the prophet of God says, "When you
[2:03:42] get everyone under this great
[2:03:44] revelation, which is Christ in you, the
[2:03:47] hope of glory, and you get everyone
[2:03:49] gathered around this great revelation,
[2:03:51] the fullness of the Godhead dwells
[2:03:54] bodily in the church
[2:03:59] and the devil tries to immediately you
[2:04:02] start looking in the mirror. my faults,
[2:04:05] my mistakes. I I don't do everything
[2:04:07] just perfect. Oh, if I could only be
[2:04:09] like my pastor. If I could only be like
[2:04:11] the prophet. Do you realize that God had
[2:04:15] his prophet messenger in this last day
[2:04:17] to openly confess his mistakes and the
[2:04:21] sins that he
[2:04:23] made because he wanted you to realize
[2:04:25] that this was not a perfect
[2:04:27] man. This was a man full of mistakes
[2:04:30] just like you and I are full of
[2:04:31] mistakes. He openly confessed them and
[2:04:34] said, "I I I I'm the least." What was he
[2:04:37] doing? He took it back through his
[2:04:39] family tree and said, "I come from all
[2:04:42] of my family died with their boots on
[2:04:43] with a gun in their hand. My my my daddy
[2:04:46] was a was an alcoholic. I was carrying
[2:04:49] water to a moonshine steel when
[2:04:56] the You mean he was carrying water to a
[2:05:00] moonshine wheel and that
[2:05:02] pillar of fire came and begin to get his
[2:05:06] attention?
[2:05:09] Yeah. Because God is not looking at your
[2:05:12] humanity, your flesh. He's looking at
[2:05:14] your soul. And he by his fornowledge
[2:05:18] forneew that you would believe this. So
[2:05:21] he predestinated you knowing you would
[2:05:23] make the choice to believe
[2:05:27] him. You see I don't have the ability I
[2:05:30] don't have I didn't have the ability to
[2:05:32] look into my life to look into my my
[2:05:35] cell and say I'm going to have a girl
[2:05:37] and four
[2:05:39] boys. I I didn't have the fornowledge. I
[2:05:42] I wasn't able to look I wasn't able to
[2:05:45] think it and say this is exactly what's
[2:05:47] going to happen and they're going to be
[2:05:48] born on this day and they're going to
[2:05:49] have this certain color and these color
[2:05:52] of eyes and all of this is going to take
[2:05:53] place and it's going to
[2:05:55] happen. Even though I knew I knew that
[2:06:00] there was a life there but God in his
[2:06:03] infinite wisdom I I hope it's just
[2:06:06] helping you for a moment. God in his
[2:06:08] infinite wisdom, he never had a new
[2:06:10] thought about
[2:06:12] anything. So God in his infinite wisdom,
[2:06:15] he forneew that you were a part of him
[2:06:18] there. So he saw you in him. That's why
[2:06:23] Paul says you were chosen in Christ
[2:06:26] before the foundation of the world.
[2:06:29] Before you had a chance to do any good
[2:06:32] or evil, God elected you. And then Paul
[2:06:36] says, "He predestinated you unto the
[2:06:40] adoption or the placing or positioning
[2:06:44] of the sons of
[2:06:47] God." What position? The message of this
[2:06:51] hour that let you know who you
[2:06:54] were. And it's taking you back to what
[2:06:57] Adam lost.
[2:07:01] Now you young people can understand a
[2:07:05] little bit why you just can't be just
[2:07:07] normal church
[2:07:09] members. There's something I I sat right
[2:07:12] where you were as just a 12, 13, 14, 15
[2:07:15] year old man and there was something in
[2:07:17] there pulsating within me. I want life.
[2:07:20] I want to serve God. I want to walk with
[2:07:23] God. I want a relationship with God. One
[2:07:25] minute I I was hearing those quotes and
[2:07:28] reading the scripture. I was
[2:07:29] predestinated before the foundation of
[2:07:31] the world. And oh, I felt so good. And
[2:07:33] then the devil came and just slapped me
[2:07:34] upside the head. And then the next day I
[2:07:36] thought, I'm lost. I'm not
[2:07:39] predestinated. The predestin it's for so
[2:07:41] and so, but it ain't for me. My pastor's
[2:07:44] predestinated, but I'm not pred. I'm
[2:07:45] just taking you through my battles. As a
[2:07:48] young person, oh, I was shouting the
[2:07:50] victory. Praise God. Hallelujah. And
[2:07:53] then I just the next day, it's just like
[2:07:55] I went on a tail spin. It was because I
[2:07:58] was dictated by my emotions. I was
[2:08:01] dictated how I viewed myself.
[2:08:04] Hallelujah. But when I come in contact
[2:08:06] with this message, that was under
[2:08:08] Pentecost. I I've got to I I got to say,
[2:08:11] I was raised as a boy under Pentecost.
[2:08:14] Amen. We seen the shouts. We've seen the
[2:08:16] speaking in tongues. We've seen the
[2:08:18] prophecies. We've seen all of those
[2:08:19] things. And then we seen many, many,
[2:08:22] many of them backslid and went right
[2:08:24] back into the world. and prophecies
[2:08:26] never come true. And there was something
[2:08:28] within me saying, "I want life. I I
[2:08:31] there's got to be something I I'm
[2:08:33] craving. I'm longing for it." And then
[2:08:35] the message came by my way. And I begin
[2:08:37] to read that. And all the sudden, God be
[2:08:40] to bring forth a manifestation and begin
[2:08:44] to place me here and show me here and
[2:08:46] show me here. And it didn't happen
[2:08:48] overnight.
[2:08:50] But God was bringing forth an
[2:08:52] understanding in my life that if I'm
[2:08:55] saved, I can never be
[2:08:57] lost. And if I'm saved, I was saved
[2:09:00] before the foundation of the world. I
[2:09:01] didn't get saved at the pew. I didn't
[2:09:03] get saved by my pastor. I didn't get
[2:09:05] saved because one day I thought it was a
[2:09:07] good idea. I got saved before the
[2:09:12] foundation of the world.
[2:09:15] And if God ever deals with your heart,
[2:09:18] he will never leave you. He will never
[2:09:21] lose you.
[2:09:24] I think one of the young girls came for
[2:09:26] prayer saying, you know, just on the
[2:09:28] little bit of that roller coaster last
[2:09:29] night, I just want to tell you, sis,
[2:09:31] God's dealing with your heart, and he'll
[2:09:34] never let you go. He'll never lose you.
[2:09:36] He swore with an oath that all that the
[2:09:39] father hath given me will come to me,
[2:09:41] and I will not lose one. And the reason
[2:09:44] that you know you're his is he's dealing
[2:09:47] with your heart and giving you a desire
[2:09:50] for
[2:09:53] God. Let that motivate your
[2:09:58] life. When that revelation come to my
[2:10:00] heart that I there's no way that I could
[2:10:02] be lost and the only way that I could
[2:10:04] have a desire for these things is
[2:10:06] because God put the thirst before the
[2:10:09] foundation of the world. It settled it.
[2:10:14] Pentecost never did that for me, but the
[2:10:17] message did. And the message is the word
[2:10:22] living
[2:10:27] today. I woke up in the middle of the
[2:10:29] night, had just a strange thing happen
[2:10:32] to
[2:10:34] me. All of a sudden, just a story begin
[2:10:38] to go through my mind that I hadn't
[2:10:39] heard in probably 20 years.
[2:10:42] And I actually had to try to find the
[2:10:44] story and I I found I found a version of
[2:10:48] it written years and years
[2:10:52] ago. And how that maybe you've heard the
[2:10:56] story how that there was a little boy,
[2:10:59] he liked
[2:11:01] boats and he just he just got a some
[2:11:06] wood and he be to work to make himself
[2:11:09] his own sailboat.
[2:11:12] cut the
[2:11:13] wood. He tenderly, lovingly put it all
[2:11:19] together. He made sure that everything
[2:11:21] looked just right. Made it the way that
[2:11:23] he wanted it to
[2:11:25] be. He put a sail on that little boat.
[2:11:28] And oh, he was so proud of that little
[2:11:31] sailboat. He got he got some red paint
[2:11:35] that maybe his daddy had in the in the
[2:11:38] shed or something. and he painted it all
[2:11:40] red. And he was so proud of his little
[2:11:45] sailboat. And he took that little
[2:11:47] sailboat and he goes down to the little
[2:11:52] stream and he put his sailboat in the in
[2:11:56] the stream and made sure that it didn't
[2:11:58] get out in the current and but just
[2:12:00] enough, you know, to make it kind of
[2:12:02] start going down down the creek. And he
[2:12:05] walked along the bank and he loved his
[2:12:09] little
[2:12:11] sailboat. Oh, his heart was so
[2:12:14] delighted. He made it with his own
[2:12:17] hands. It was exactly the way he saw it
[2:12:19] in his mind,
[2:12:21] too. He was delighted in his little
[2:12:24] sailboat.
[2:12:27] One day, day after day, he would come
[2:12:30] and he would put his little sailboat in
[2:12:31] the water and he'd watch
[2:12:35] it. But one
[2:12:38] day he put it in a place where the
[2:12:41] current started picking it up and the
[2:12:44] current took it off into the main
[2:12:47] rapids.
[2:12:49] And he watched with
[2:12:50] dread as his little
[2:12:54] sailboat began to go through those big
[2:12:57] rapids and take it faster and faster.
[2:12:59] And oh, he ran along the bank as fast,
[2:13:02] trying to keep up and keeping it in his
[2:13:06] sight. Finally, the little sailboat went
[2:13:10] beyond his
[2:13:12] pew. It hurt
[2:13:14] him because that was his little
[2:13:16] sailboat.
[2:13:18] He loved that little
[2:13:20] sailboat. He would go to the bank day
[2:13:23] after day, day after
[2:13:26] day
[2:13:28] looking, "Oh, I wish I could get my
[2:13:31] little sailboat back."
[2:13:35] Some months went
[2:13:36] by and one day he was going through
[2:13:40] town, you know, his little boy's wheel
[2:13:43] is going through town and looking in the
[2:13:45] windows and and he come to a certain
[2:13:50] pawn
[2:13:51] shop and lo and behold in the
[2:13:55] window was his little sailboat.
[2:13:59] Oh, his heart began
[2:14:01] to Oh, it's got to be it. I know it's
[2:14:05] got to be it. And he ran through the
[2:14:07] door and he went into the window and and
[2:14:10] he's looking at it and here comes here
[2:14:13] comes the owner and he says, "Oh, I want
[2:14:15] to see that little sailboat."
[2:14:17] And grabs that little sailboat and he's
[2:14:19] starting to look. He said, "Oh, yes, I
[2:14:21] see it." He began to identify the little
[2:14:24] marks that he with love put it all
[2:14:27] together. He said, "That's
[2:14:29] mine." He said,
[2:14:32] "Sir, how
[2:14:34] much how much do you want for the
[2:14:37] sailboat?" He said, "It's going to be
[2:14:40] $5." He said, "Oh, I I don't know."
[2:14:44] Said, "I got to have
[2:14:45] it. I got to have it. I got to redeem
[2:14:48] it. I got to buy it
[2:14:52] back." So, he says, "Sure, please hold
[2:14:55] it. I'll be back. I'm gonna go get the
[2:14:58] money. I'll pay the
[2:15:02] price. So, he's
[2:15:05] motivated. Oh,
[2:15:10] God. So, the little boy runs back and he
[2:15:13] gets his piggy bank and you know how the
[2:15:16] oldfashioned those piggy banks were that
[2:15:18] you put the money in and you got to
[2:15:20] smash the little piggy to get the money
[2:15:22] out, you know? So he smashes the little
[2:15:25] piggy and he starts counting the
[2:15:29] money and he counts out
[2:15:32] $5, just
[2:15:35] enough. And he takes his $5 and he walks
[2:15:38] through that door. His little shoulders
[2:15:40] are out and walks right up to the
[2:15:42] counter and says,
[2:15:43] "Sir, here is the
[2:15:48] $5. I want my sailboat."
[2:15:52] And the man gave him the cell phone and
[2:15:54] he took that cell phone and he put it to
[2:15:55] his bosom and he's walking down the
[2:15:57] street with the biggest smile and he
[2:15:59] says, "You're twice
[2:16:02] mine. I made
[2:16:04] you and I bought you.
[2:16:13] I was that little sailboat.
[2:16:19] Oh, I didn't know
[2:16:22] it. Satan put me in spiritual
[2:16:26] amnesia. I didn't even know it. I didn't
[2:16:29] even know I was the son of God. I didn't
[2:16:31] know I I
[2:16:34] belong in, you know, that I belong to
[2:16:37] God's economy.
[2:16:40] I didn't know that God had given me
[2:16:43] authority and dominion and I'm an
[2:16:45] overcomer. All these
[2:16:47] things. I didn't know anything about
[2:16:50] it because Satan had got a hold of my
[2:16:53] life and put me in the rapids and took
[2:16:55] me far far away.
[2:16:58] Oh, but then I begin to hear a preacher
[2:17:02] and I begin to hear my name and that
[2:17:04] preaching and says that God so loved you
[2:17:07] that he gave his only begotten
[2:17:09] son and God condescended from me his
[2:17:13] heavenly throne and he become one of us.
[2:17:16] He become our kinsman redeemer that that
[2:17:20] we couldn't we no one could die for our
[2:17:23] sins. Moses couldn't do it. Paul
[2:17:25] couldn't do it. Jeremiah couldn't do it.
[2:17:31] But Jesus was God made flesh and he went
[2:17:33] to the cross willingly and he gave his
[2:17:36] life to redeem
[2:17:38] us. And then he went down into hell and
[2:17:41] he kicked the door open and he says,
[2:17:43] "Satan, I paid the
[2:17:47] price.
[2:17:48] Satan, you can't have them any longer.
[2:17:51] They're my sons. There's my They're my
[2:17:53] daughters. You put them on those rapids
[2:17:56] and then you put them into your own pawn
[2:17:58] shop. But I am here to declare my blood
[2:18:00] is still wet on the cross. I paid the
[2:18:03] price. I am perfect and sinless now.
[2:18:06] Satan, give me the keys to death and
[2:18:08] hell.
[2:18:11] Hallelujah. And he reached and he
[2:18:13] grabbed those keys and he ripped them
[2:18:15] off of of Satan's side. And then he
[2:18:17] kicked Satan back into his office and he
[2:18:20] slammed the door and said, "Satan, don't
[2:18:23] bother him
[2:18:25] again." And then he went and ascended
[2:18:27] into paradise where Moses and Abraham
[2:18:30] and Sarah and and and Ezekiel and
[2:18:33] Jeremiah, all of them seeing images,
[2:18:36] manifestations of God. And he walked
[2:18:39] into into their presence and every one
[2:18:41] of them identified and said, "There he
[2:18:43] is. That's the wheel in the middle of
[2:18:45] the wheel that I saw. That's the pillar
[2:18:48] of fire. That is God. Hallelujah. And
[2:18:53] then he led captivity captive. Amen.
[2:18:56] Gave gifts unto men and he brought them
[2:18:58] back into that glorious procession into
[2:19:05] heaven. And the words are still echoing
[2:19:08] around the world world. It's finished.
[2:19:13] But for 2,000 years, Satan has tried
[2:19:16] once again to bring us back into
[2:19:19] denominational
[2:19:23] ignorance. And Jesus for 2,000 years has
[2:19:26] been sitting on the right hand of the
[2:19:28] father interceding on our ignorance,
[2:19:31] saying, "Father, forgive them. Father,
[2:19:33] forgive them. I paid the price for them.
[2:19:35] Oh God, they're I I I saw them. They
[2:19:39] were in my thoughts. God, save them."
[2:19:42] But in this last
[2:19:47] day, right
[2:19:49] before his his second
[2:19:52] coming, he came and he opened the word
[2:19:56] and said, "Now
[2:19:57] listen, I've already paid the
[2:20:00] price. You don't have to be hybrid any
[2:20:04] longer. I paid the price for your
[2:20:06] hybriding."
[2:20:09] You can come back to the original spoken
[2:20:11] word seed
[2:20:13] now. You can be
[2:20:16] motivated. Don't go back to that pawn
[2:20:18] shop any
[2:20:21] longer. Don't Don't allow your heart to
[2:20:24] be full of dread and fear any longer.
[2:20:27] You're free.
[2:20:32] That's why I'm
[2:20:33] happy. That's why I'm stimulated. I
[2:20:36] become so emotional.
[2:20:39] It's because there's something I know
[2:20:42] that I know that I know that I am twice
[2:20:46] his. He made me and he bought
[2:20:51] me. Let the musicians
[2:20:55] come. Oh God, I love you.
[2:21:02] That little song that says, "Can't you
[2:21:04] see why I'm
[2:21:08] happy? I sing
[2:21:12] because I'm
[2:21:16] free. His
[2:21:18] eyes are
[2:21:20] on the
[2:21:24] sparrow. Then I
[2:21:26] know he
[2:21:29] watches me.
[2:21:33] Oh, I
[2:21:35] sing
[2:21:37] because I'm happy.
[2:21:43] I
[2:21:44] see
[2:21:46] because I'm free.
[2:21:52] Oh, his
[2:21:54] eyes are
[2:21:57] on the
[2:22:00] [Music]
[2:22:01] spare and I
[2:22:04] know he
[2:22:08] watches me.
[2:22:12] Oh, I
[2:22:14] sing
[2:22:16] because I'm
[2:22:21] happy. I
[2:22:24] sing
[2:22:26] because I'm
[2:22:31] free. His
[2:22:34] eyes are
[2:22:36] on the spare.
[2:22:40] [Music]
[2:22:42] And I
[2:22:45] know he
[2:22:49] watches me. Aren't you
[2:22:52] glad? Oh, I
[2:22:55] sing
[2:22:57] because I'm
[2:23:01] happy. Oh, I
[2:23:05] sing
[2:23:07] because I'm free.
[2:23:11] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Oh, his
[2:23:16] eyes are
[2:23:18] on the
[2:23:23] sparrow. And I
[2:23:27] know he
[2:23:29] [Music]
[2:23:30] watches me.
[2:23:35] If there's something that is motivating
[2:23:38] your
[2:23:39] [Music]
[2:23:41] life and is taking you away from
[2:23:46] God, there's a spirit within you that is
[2:23:51] not allowing you to line up with his
[2:23:53] word.
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:23:59] Maybe you've you've quit, you know,
[2:24:02] maybe smoking or alcohol or
[2:24:09] lusting, but clearly the prophet let us
[2:24:12] know that there's more Holy Ghost to be
[2:24:15] had.
[2:24:19] That's why in the spirit of revival, the
[2:24:22] prophet of God took us there to Elisha
[2:24:24] in that desert.
[2:24:28] and said, "You've got to dig
[2:24:30] down." We did a lot of digging last
[2:24:33] night. I think God came in a real
[2:24:36] supernatural way. We're not trying to
[2:24:38] dig things, bring things back
[2:24:41] up. But maybe there is someone the last
[2:24:45] service of this
[2:24:46] meeting, maybe there's something that
[2:24:49] the Lord has brought to your
[2:24:51] attention. Maybe you're not able to make
[2:24:54] a full surrender. Maybe you're just
[2:24:56] needing to surrender your life all
[2:24:58] together. But before we turn it over to
[2:25:01] our
[2:25:02] pastor, I wonder if we can just bow our
[2:25:08] heads and just right where you're
[2:25:11] sitting with an honest heart. You don't
[2:25:14] have to lift your
[2:25:17] hands. All you have to do is say, "Lord
[2:25:21] Jesus," and begin to just talk it over
[2:25:24] with me.
[2:25:26] Maybe you went home last night thinking,
[2:25:28] I know I should have
[2:25:30] moved. I I know I I need the Holy
[2:25:34] Ghost. Maybe you're a young man that
[2:25:38] you're being
[2:25:39] torn and you're just desiring a real
[2:25:43] experience with
[2:25:46] God. Then I want to say this morning,
[2:25:49] it's for
[2:25:51] you. It's for you.
[2:25:54] I remember many years ago I was in
[2:25:57] Ukraine preaching a youth
[2:26:00] camp and just one after the other God
[2:26:03] just filled with the Holy Ghost. And
[2:26:05] there was a young man that so wanted the
[2:26:08] Holy Ghost. He came up to me after the
[2:26:11] last evening service. He said, "Brother
[2:26:14] Jonathan, I'm so
[2:26:16] discouraged. I I want the Holy Ghost so
[2:26:18] bad."
[2:26:20] He said, "But I I seen everyone else
[2:26:22] getting it and I didn't get
[2:26:25] it." I looked at that young man and I
[2:26:27] said, "Everyone else in the morning,
[2:26:31] they're going to start, they're already
[2:26:33] thinking about leaving, packing their
[2:26:36] bags, getting everything
[2:26:39] ready. A lot of their minds is not even
[2:26:42] going to be on the service."
[2:26:44] I said, 'But not
[2:26:46] you. Because you're going to come into
[2:26:48] the into tomorrow's service and you're
[2:26:52] going to come with an expectation that
[2:26:53] this is my service, my time, my moment,
[2:26:57] and God's going to fill you with the
[2:26:58] Holy
[2:27:00] Ghost. When that young man came, he came
[2:27:03] just as I told him to with an
[2:27:07] expectation as everyone else was kind of
[2:27:09] distracted. Service got dismissed.
[2:27:11] Everyone, it I wouldn't even say that it
[2:27:14] was like just a real high service. It
[2:27:18] was just everyone was dismissed, begin
[2:27:21] to start walking out the doors. And
[2:27:23] there was a a preacher that was sitting
[2:27:26] beside that young man. And I I told him,
[2:27:28] I said, "Brother, just lay your hands
[2:27:30] over on that man. That young man, he's
[2:27:33] praying for the Holy Ghost." He laid his
[2:27:36] hands on him. And that moment, God
[2:27:38] filled him with the Holy Ghost.
[2:27:41] Everyone else was already walking, just
[2:27:43] leaving. Their minds weren't even on it.
[2:27:45] But that young man was filled with the
[2:27:47] Holy Ghost. Afterwards, he hugged me,
[2:27:49] weeping, crying, shouting, and said, "I
[2:27:53] got it. I got it. I got it."
[2:27:57] I just want to say to
[2:27:59] you that I know we're all a little
[2:28:03] tired, but this is a special
[2:28:06] moment. I believe this is a real special
[2:28:10] visitation for
[2:28:12] you. I see the tears just flowing down
[2:28:15] your faces. God dealing with your
[2:28:19] hearts. I want to tell you, you're the
[2:28:21] individual that God is dealing
[2:28:24] with. Why don't you just open up your
[2:28:27] heart? Whatever it is, I just want to
[2:28:31] say if you need to give your heart to
[2:28:33] the Lord, then all you have to do is
[2:28:35] say, "Lord, I surrender. I believe you.
[2:28:38] Forgive me my
[2:28:39] sins." If you need to be washed and
[2:28:41] sanctified, then say, "Lord
[2:28:44] Jesus, there's areas in my life that I I
[2:28:47] know it's not pleasing to you. Lord,
[2:28:50] would you take the desires and just
[2:28:52] sanctify me, cleanse me?"
[2:28:56] And if you need the Holy Ghost and
[2:28:58] you're sitting there as a sanctified
[2:28:59] vessel saying, "Oh God, I want an
[2:29:02] experience with you." Then I tell you,
[2:29:06] all you have to do is just open up your
[2:29:08] heart right now and say, "God, fill me."
[2:29:11] It's that simple. You will be
[2:29:14] filled. It's that simple. You don't have
[2:29:18] to beg. All you have to do is say, "God,
[2:29:20] you promised it.
[2:29:24] God, you promised
[2:29:27] it. I tell you friends, I don't care
[2:29:30] what your age is or how long you've been
[2:29:32] in this message. Let God take us deeper.
[2:29:36] Do you think that's a good thing? Let
[2:29:39] God take us
[2:29:40] deeper. Say, "Oh,
[2:29:43] God." Maybe you're teetering. Maybe
[2:29:45] you're wondering about your position.
[2:29:47] May maybe there's just a little maybe
[2:29:50] you're having a hard time fully coming
[2:29:52] under the headship of the vindicated
[2:29:55] word of the hour. Then then for you why
[2:29:58] don't you just say
[2:30:00] Lord why don't you just with a heartfelt
[2:30:03] say
[2:30:04] Lord I feel something motivating me and
[2:30:08] I just want to say not my will thy will
[2:30:12] be done.
[2:30:13] You vindicated this message for me to
[2:30:17] show me my
[2:30:18] position. And I just want to say be it
[2:30:21] unto me, oh God. Take me
[2:30:23] deeper. Show me, oh
[2:30:26] God. I I I don't want to do one thing
[2:30:29] without it being your
[2:30:31] will. Thank you, Father, for stimulating
[2:30:35] me. Heavenly
[2:30:38] Father, our hearts are exposed.
[2:30:42] Lord, it's a moment in the service that
[2:30:44] your Holy Spirit has motivated
[2:30:48] us. And right now, we're we're open
[2:30:52] before you. Hearts are just wide
[2:30:56] open. Then, Lord, we invite you to move
[2:30:59] and work as only you can
[2:31:02] move. You're the great physician. You're
[2:31:04] the doctor. And I pray that you would
[2:31:07] take your physician's knife, sharper
[2:31:11] than a two-edged sword, and to begin to
[2:31:14] just do surgery on our
[2:31:17] hearts. Cut out the little things of the
[2:31:20] world. Cut out little areas that's
[2:31:23] holding us
[2:31:24] back. And we invite you to fill us,
[2:31:28] Lord. Feel every fiber of our
[2:31:30] being. We invite you to have
[2:31:33] preeminence, oh God. We invite you one
[2:31:36] more time as this is the last service of
[2:31:39] these meetings. I pray that you save. I
[2:31:42] pray that you cleanse, that you heal. I
[2:31:45] pray, oh God, that you take us deeper
[2:31:48] and deeper into thee. Oh God, fill every
[2:31:53] fiber of our
[2:31:55] being. Oh
[2:31:57] Lord, anoint our lives with even a
[2:32:00] greater anointing like we've never had
[2:32:03] before.
[2:32:05] Father, as as this church is a beacon of
[2:32:10] light, a beacon of the evening
[2:32:14] light, Lord, to this
[2:32:17] community. And I pray, oh
[2:32:20] God, that as I believe that there are
[2:32:24] still sheep that is maybe in a thicket
[2:32:27] and they don't know how to get out of
[2:32:30] it, but that you've got some real
[2:32:32] shepherds here. You've got some bornag
[2:32:35] again sons and daughters of God. You've
[2:32:37] got some real witnesses that you can
[2:32:39] lead to go right by their way and to get
[2:32:43] them out of that
[2:32:45] thicket. I pray, Father, that you would
[2:32:48] continue to bless this congregation.
[2:32:50] Bless bless our pastor, Father. Continue
[2:32:53] to strengthen his hands and anoint him,
[2:32:56] Lord. And as there is just I see Lord
[2:32:59] I've been so blessed to see the real
[2:33:02] spirit of love and unity and fellowship
[2:33:06] around your word. I pray that you can
[2:33:10] continue to just
[2:33:12] strengthen the hands of each
[2:33:15] member. But Lord, we need one
[2:33:19] another. And I pray God that you would
[2:33:22] continue to motivate each and every one
[2:33:24] of
[2:33:24] us. Lord, the very moment that we stop
[2:33:27] moving is the moment that we
[2:33:30] backslide. And God, how many times we do
[2:33:33] backslide and we repent of it. But Lord,
[2:33:37] we want to keep walking in step with
[2:33:40] your
[2:33:41] word in
[2:33:43] rhythm and beat with thus saith the
[2:33:48] Lord. Father, we love you and I thank
[2:33:51] you for your strength and your
[2:33:54] encouragement in the name of Jesus
[2:33:57] Christ. Amen. And
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:05] amen. One more time as our pastor comes.
[2:34:08] I
[2:34:10] sing
[2:34:12] because I'm happy.
[2:34:16] Oh, I
[2:34:19] sing
[2:34:21] [Music]
[2:34:38] because let's stand together if we
[2:34:41] would.
[2:34:42] Draw me. Draw me, Lord.
[2:34:47] You
[2:34:49] alone are all I
[2:34:56] need. For you hold my destiny.
[2:35:04] [Music]
[2:35:06] You alone are all I
[2:35:13] need. In you
[2:35:17] alone I
[2:35:19] am
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:25] complete. Draw me.
[2:35:29] [Music]
[2:35:30] Draw me,
[2:35:34] Lord, and I'll come running after
[2:35:43] you. Draw
[2:35:47] me. Draw me,
[2:35:51] Lord, and I'll come running after you.
[2:35:56] You
[2:35:58] alone. For you alone are all I
[2:36:07] need. For you hold my
[2:36:16] destiny. You alone are all I need.
[2:36:24] In you
[2:36:27] alone I
[2:36:29] am
[2:36:34] complete. So draw
[2:36:39] me, draw me,
[2:36:43] Lord, and I'll come running after
[2:36:50] you. Hallelujah.
[2:36:53] Draw
[2:36:56] me, draw me,
[2:37:00] Lord, and I'll come running after you.
[2:37:05] Draw
[2:37:09] me. So draw
[2:37:13] me, draw me,
[2:37:17] Lord, and I'll come running after you.
[2:37:27] Draw
[2:37:31] me, draw me,
[2:37:35] Lord, and I'll come running after you.
[2:37:39] You alone are all I
[2:37:41] need. For you alone are all I
[2:37:48] [Music]
[2:37:50] need. For you hold my
[2:37:59] destiny. You alone are all I
[2:38:06] need. In you
[2:38:09] alone I
[2:38:11] am complete.
[2:38:18] Draw
[2:38:21] me, drop me,
[2:38:26] Lord, I'll come running after
[2:38:34] you. Draw me.
[2:38:39] Call me
[2:38:42] Lord and I'll come running after
[2:38:51] you. Draw
[2:38:55] me, draw me,
[2:38:59] Lord, and I'll come running after you.
[2:39:09] Draw
[2:39:12] me, draw me,
[2:39:16] Lord, and I'll come running after you. I
[2:39:21] feel the pull.
[2:39:26] I feel the pull.
[2:39:31] [Music]
[2:39:33] I hear the call.
[2:39:39] [Music]
[2:39:41] And I know that his
[2:39:45] spirit's
[2:39:46] moving
[2:39:48] me to give my
[2:39:55] all. He speaks to me
[2:40:03] and
[2:40:04] I agree.
[2:40:07] [Music]
[2:40:11] Lord, please come and
[2:40:15] take
[2:40:17] control. I feel the
[2:40:24] cold. Oh, at night I
[2:40:28] lay in
[2:40:29] bed and
[2:40:31] I
[2:40:33] begin to cry.
[2:40:36] [Music]
[2:40:40] And my mind just fails to
[2:40:46] know
[2:40:48] exactly
[2:40:53] why. Oh, I can't
[2:40:57] explain with tongue or
[2:41:01] pain. A spirit
[2:41:04] calling
[2:41:06] deep
[2:41:08] within. I must be
[2:41:12] God here in my
[2:41:15] soul. For I feel the call.
[2:41:22] I
[2:41:24] feel the call.
[2:41:30] I hear the
[2:41:36] call and I know that his
[2:41:40] spirit's
[2:41:42] moving
[2:41:43] me to give my
[2:41:50] all. He speaks to
[2:41:57] me and
[2:42:05] I Lord please come and take me
[2:42:11] control. I feel the cold.
[2:42:19] Oh, I went to hear the
[2:42:24] word and with each
[2:42:27] line and
[2:42:30] [Music]
[2:42:32] praise. Oh, he was
[2:42:36] calling me to give a
[2:42:42] higher praise.
[2:42:45] [Music]
[2:42:47] Oh, there's a
[2:42:50] deep call to the deep. It's like a great
[2:42:57] magnet
[2:42:59] pulling
[2:43:01] me. Oh, I know for sure that I reach the
[2:43:07] goal. For I feel the cold.
[2:43:15] I feel the
[2:43:21] cold. I
[2:43:23] feel the
[2:43:29] And I know that his
[2:43:32] spirit's
[2:43:34] moving me to give my
[2:43:42] all. He speaks to
[2:43:49] me and
[2:43:51] [Music]
[2:43:56] I Lord please come and take
[2:44:03] control. I feel the flow.
[2:44:10] I feel the
[2:44:16] call. I hear the
[2:44:23] call. And I know that his
[2:44:27] spirit's
[2:44:29] moving me to give my all.
[2:44:38] He speaks to
[2:44:41] [Music]
[2:44:44] me and
[2:44:46] [Music]
[2:44:51] I Oh Lord, please come and take
[2:44:58] control. I feel the cold.
[2:45:06] Oh, I went to hear the word and with
[2:45:12] each line and
[2:45:18] praise. Oh, he was
[2:45:22] calling me to give a
[2:45:28] higher praise.
[2:45:31] [Music]
[2:45:33] Oh, there's a
[2:45:36] deep call to the deep. It's like a great
[2:45:43] magnet
[2:45:45] pulling
[2:45:46] me. Oh, I know for sure that I'll reach
[2:45:52] the goal. For I feel the cold.
[2:46:01] I feel the
[2:46:06] call. I hear the call.
[2:46:21] to get my
[2:46:27] all. He speaks to
[2:46:34] me and
[2:46:41] I Lord please come and take
[2:46:48] control. I feel the hope.
[2:46:55] Amen. We've heard a word of liberty this
[2:46:57] morning. He had to wake his preacher up
[2:47:00] at 2:00 a.m. for
[2:47:01] you. You know, I was thinking last
[2:47:05] night, we don't deserve it. Some of us
[2:47:09] don't deserve it a little more than
[2:47:10] others. We
[2:47:12] think that's what grace is for,
[2:47:15] for those that don't deserve it. Amen.
[2:47:19] For those that think they've wasted away
[2:47:21] their day of grace. For those that think
[2:47:24] that besetting sin will hold them back.
[2:47:26] For those that have been in the pawn
[2:47:28] shop for so long they don't know what it
[2:47:30] means to be in liberty. That's who grace
[2:47:32] is for. Not for those that deserve it.
[2:47:35] It's for those that don't think they
[2:47:37] deserve it.
[2:47:39] That's why he had to wake up brother
[2:47:41] Jonathan at 2:00 a.m. last night. I knew
[2:47:43] we were in for a good service when he
[2:47:45] wakes his servant up and says, "I've got
[2:47:47] something else that you need to bring."
[2:47:50] Amen. You can go free this morning. You
[2:47:53] can come out of the pawn shop. You say,
[2:47:55] "I've been serving the Lord for 20
[2:47:57] years." Let me tell you, 20 year old
[2:47:59] believers, 20 year veterans, we still
[2:48:02] have needs. We still have things that
[2:48:04] are bound bound in our lives.
[2:48:06] Amen. But there's a spirit of God here
[2:48:08] this morning that brought us his word.
[2:48:11] We read that scripture in Psalms 107. He
[2:48:14] sent his word and delivered them. But
[2:48:17] you've got to take his word. You got to
[2:48:19] take him at his word. Amen. And then he
[2:48:22] does the work. Amen. We're going to sing
[2:48:24] that song. Break every chain. Amen.
[2:48:27] Break every
[2:48:28] chain. Church. I don't know some of you
[2:48:31] have
[2:48:32] a a a reservation. I know. I don't have
[2:48:36] any reservations this morning. You need
[2:48:38] a chain broken this morning.
[2:48:41] All you have to do is take him at his
[2:48:43] word. You don't break your chain. He
[2:48:45] breaks your chain. All you got to say
[2:48:47] is, "I want to go free. I want to go
[2:48:49] free. I don't want to deal with this
[2:48:51] anymore. I don't want to stay where I am
[2:48:53] anymore. I want to come up and give a
[2:48:56] higher praise." Church, what is a higher
[2:48:58] praise? It is a life lived by the word.
[2:49:01] It is not the praise of your mouth. It's
[2:49:03] the praise of your life by the power of
[2:49:05] the Holy Spirit living through you. You
[2:49:08] can say, "I've tried it before."
[2:49:10] Let him start trying. You try, he does.
[2:49:14] You attempt, he achieves. You fight, he
[2:49:18] wins the victory. Amen. It's not in
[2:49:21] trying, but it's in trusting. Amen. He's
[2:49:24] got to break the chain. But when he sets
[2:49:26] you free, the scripture says he who the
[2:49:29] son sets free is free indeed. It's a
[2:49:33] finished work. It's a total deliverance
[2:49:36] when he does it. You don't have to go in
[2:49:38] and out. You don't have to come and go.
[2:49:41] You don't have to have your ups and
[2:49:42] downs. Your emotions will go up and
[2:49:44] down. Life will go up and down. But you
[2:49:46] can stay steady in the storm because
[2:49:48] there is an anchor of your soul by the
[2:49:51] sealing power of the Holy Spirit in your
[2:49:53] life. Amen. There's a spirit here to
[2:49:55] break every chain this morning. And all
[2:49:57] you have to do is say, "Lord, I want it.
[2:50:00] I want to be free." The only thing that
[2:50:02] holds him back, he's a gentleman, is
[2:50:04] your will.
[2:50:06] You say, "I want to be free." He'll
[2:50:07] break the chain. But you got to raise
[2:50:10] your hand. How many times did you say
[2:50:12] last night, Brother Jonathan, he says,
[2:50:14] "There's a universal sign of surrender.
[2:50:17] Not one hand, two hands to break the
[2:50:21] barrier of gravity and say, "It's for
[2:50:23] me. I surrender. I surrender. Lord, I'm
[2:50:27] in your hands and you're going to do the
[2:50:28] work and you'll break every chain." The
[2:50:32] last one that's broken for me is death
[2:50:36] and hell and the grave. He's got the
[2:50:38] keys. I just don't feel it all the time.
[2:50:40] But there comes a day when we're going
[2:50:41] to be changed in a moment of a twinkling
[2:50:43] of an eye. But let me tell you, before
[2:50:45] that chain's broken, he's got to break
[2:50:47] every other chain in our life. Amen. It
[2:50:49] starts when you say, "Lord, I've heard
[2:50:52] my call. I want to be set free. Let me
[2:50:56] live in the liberty of your Holy
[2:50:58] Spirit." Amen. You want prayer, brother
[2:51:01] Jonathan? You got some more left in you.
[2:51:03] Can you pray for some more people? You
[2:51:05] want to be prayed? We'll pray. You want
[2:51:07] to be set free? The Lord will set you
[2:51:10] free. You want to be filled with the
[2:51:12] spirit, come ask. You want to be
[2:51:16] refilled, he'll refill you. In Acts
[2:51:20] chapter
[2:51:21] 2, he filled them. In Acts chapter 4, a
[2:51:26] couple days later, he came and refilled
[2:51:27] them. You say, "Brother John, I just
[2:51:29] got." You can get a refilling. I don't
[2:51:32] care how long you've been serving him.
[2:51:33] We all need a refilling. We need a
[2:51:35] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[2:51:37] this morning. Amen. We've had it. But
[2:51:40] you say, "I haven't got what I need."
[2:51:41] You come and get it. You claim it this
[2:51:43] morning. It's yours to take. Amen. Break
[2:51:46] every chain.
[2:51:50] And there is
[2:51:53] power in the name of
[2:51:58] Hallelujah.
[2:51:59] Yes. There is
[2:52:03] power in the name of
[2:52:09] Jesus. There is
[2:52:12] power in the name of Jesus.

[2:52:23] chain. To break every
[2:52:28] chain. To break every chain. To break
[2:52:32] every chain. To break every

[2:52:50] army
[2:52:52] rising
[2:52:56] up. There's an
[2:52:59] army
[2:53:01] rise

[2:53:33] Jesus. There is
[2:53:37] power in the name of Jesus.
[2:53:43] There is

[2:53:51] Jesus to break every chain. To break
[2:53:55] every chain to break every
[2:54:00] chain to break every chain to break
[2:54:04] every chain to break every chain.
[2:54:11] There's an

[2:54:22] army
[2:54:24] rising
[2:54:28] up. There's an
[2:54:31] army
[2:54:33] rise
[2:54:37] up. She'll break every chain. She'll
[2:54:40] break every chain. She'll break every
[2:54:46] chain. Break every chain. She'll break
[2:54:50] every chain. Break every
[2:54:55] chain. There's an
[2:54:59] army
[2:55:01] rising up.
[2:55:05] There's
[2:55:08] another
[2:55:10] rise now.
[2:55:12] [Music]
[2:55:14] There's
[2:55:17] another
[2:55:22] rise. Break every chain. Break every
[2:55:27] chain. Break every

[2:55:49] chain shall break every chain to break
[2:55:54] every break every chain.
[2:55:59] Oh, there is

[2:56:08] Jesus. There is
[2:56:11] power in the name of Jesus.
[2:56:18] There is
[2:56:20] power in the name of
[2:56:26] Jesus to break
[2:56:28] everything. Break
[2:56:30] everything. Break every
[2:56:37] chain. Break every chain. Break every
[2:56:42] chain.

[2:56:52] Jesus. Hallelujah. There is
[2:56:56] power in the name of
[2:57:02] Jesus. There is
[2:57:05] power in the name of
[2:57:10] Jesus to break every chain. Break every

[2:58:58] 9:22. He will carry you. We're going to
[2:59:01] sing that.
[2:59:04] Thank you Jesus.
[2:59:06] There is no problem so
[2:59:10] big God cannot solve
[2:59:18] it. There is no mountain
[2:59:23] to heal.
[2:59:32] There is no storm to
[2:59:35] die. God cannot come
[2:59:41] in.
[2:59:43] Amen. There is no sorrow to
[2:59:48] thee that he cannot.
[2:59:52] [Music]
[2:59:55] And if he carries the weight of the
[3:00:01] world upon his
[3:00:09] shoulder, I know my brother and
[3:00:14] he will carry you. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[3:00:19] Hallelujah.

[3:00:47] Jesus. There is no problem. So
[3:00:52] big for God cannot stop
[3:00:56] it. Thank you
[3:01:00] Lord. There is no mountain to
[3:01:05] talk. He can move
[3:01:11] it.
[3:01:13] Hallelujah. There is no storm to die.
[3:01:18] What can I come
[3:01:22] in?
[3:01:25] Hallelujah. There is no sorrow

[3:02:46] you. Bless the Lord. And if he carries
[3:02:52] the whale of the
[3:02:55] world, the body is
[3:02:59] sure. Thank you,
[3:03:02] Jesus. I know my sister that
[3:03:07] he will carry you.
[3:03:16] There is no problem so
[3:03:20] big. God cannot
[3:03:23] solve your choice. Hallelujah.
[3:03:27] Hallelujah. There is no mountain
[3:03:32] to
[3:03:37] he. Oh, bless the Lord.
