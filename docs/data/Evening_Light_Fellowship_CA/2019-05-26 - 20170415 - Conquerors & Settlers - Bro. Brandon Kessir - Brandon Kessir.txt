let the book live in me 1:29 that's what we want tonight as we want to vote the word to live in us everyone of course we want to become one with that word so let's sing that tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's the thing more than anything else that we want is that we want his word to be living in our lives you know so much that's become my passion more and more as that you know we they have a lot of information that lives in us and we have you know a lot of times we call that information revelation because you know it's spiritual and it's you know it it's complicated maybe to us but but real revelation isn't just knowledge it isn't just information and we say well that was very interesting and you know I just feel like I understand God better but when it under when we really understand God God better as when it lives inside of us and it's become a part of us and nobody's ever accused me of being a deep preacher and come scratching their head after service man what what were you talking about I really am Not sure I mean there was way too many symbols and types and Greek words and all that that's not my ministry at all but what I what I hope it is is thought-provoking and heart provoking in the sense that we look at our lives a lot of times and human beings do not like to be told that we've got anything wrong we don't like to be told that you know maybe our lives are lacking in any way and so you know what I what I have on my heart a lot of times is just to come at it from a different angle and just say you know are we really capturing that or we really you know are we really in tune are we really in sync because a lot of times it's not a complete teardown of our lives that we need but it's it's just kind of a renewal or it's you know it's a different focus a different challenge and just say yeah I know this stuff like like Peter said you know we're really here to call to remember and stir up your pure pure minds but to just help us recognize hey there's little areas all the time where the devil tries to get us to compromise and when we compromise we find very quickly at the power of God just kind of get zapped from our lives and then we come and say oh man you know I'm still coming to church I'm still doing all the things I supposed to be doing but I'm not really having victory anymore and and I believe the Bride of Christ should be victorious and powerful and that we're not going to be scraping into the rapture just like oh I can't believe I made it like this is this is amazing I you know it's like when the lottery I actually got got here you know well had a one-in-a-billion chance of making it and somehow I got here but I think that the bride will go in having confidence that she's gonna make it having confidence that you know that that promise is for her and that not just like oh I hope I make the rapture but I know that the rapture can't even go because I'm not ready yet and I'm gonna be there so you know trust that as we get ready we you know we we realized that on one hand it's not up to us you know it takes God's Spirit to lead us and to guide us on every step of the way but on the other hand it is up to us because the scripture says that the wife has made herself ready you know it's not a time of doing nothing and so I trust tonight we will see that that that's you know as much as we've grown and we've come to a place with God God never wants us to get satisfied with that and he never wants us to get comfortable with that to the point that we say you know what this is good I'm just in a good place to sit back and wait until you know the rest of things unfold but there's still more land as as Joshua told our children Israel there's still much land to be possessed and I believe right till that you know right till we cross over we're still gonna say you know that rapture morning we're gonna say I still want to be closer to the Lord I still want to you know I want to take another step another step I don't know if you guys sing this song you know one day I want to take a step towards my theophany but you know it's a constant progress towards that place that God has for us and it doesn't end because you've been here 20 years or 30 years or doesn't it doesn't matter how long you've been serving the Lord you know we never want to get comfortable and complacent and just stop so thank you so much for your tenth of dish last night and I I hope we all came rested up and ready to go again looking a little tired but know who we're thankful for the brothers and the fellowship that we had this morning and just had a real nice time with brother Adam and Jamie brother out of sister Jamie at their house we appreciate their hospitality and I was thinking about brother Matt back there tonight and I thought you know he does such a good job and shout out to the sound guy because having been there it's a little bit of underappreciated job sometimes he does a real good job juggling the video and everything so god bless you brother man hey man let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father we're here tonight you know what you have in store for us most importantly Lord I've prepared this thought that you put on my hearts and and the people here tonight Lord some knew from last night and and I pray you just help us all to settle in real well Lord and to catch the inspiration here father it's nothing that I can bring but it's what you can bring Lord and we just ask that more than just our ears being filled with words tonight Lord that you would sweep through the building father that your spirit would anoint us and that Lord we'd be able to receive what you're really saying what our situation is though what I I don't know anyone's life here but you know it law it inside out and I pray that there's some encouragement there and there's some motivation father to reach higher than we have before and conquer more than we have before Lord we just commit the service into your hands then we ask you to have your perfect way in Jesus name so this thing will do for now we could turn our Bibles to Romans chapter 8 looking at this thought tonight of conquerors and settlers or settlers however you say that I sometimes say both but in this case it's more about settlers people who have settled and then people that have conquered so conquerors and settlers and this is kind of a special service to me the Lord gave me the inspiration for it brother Jerry was preaching one morning back home and you know it really started to come on my mind you know this thought it was you know it's kind of related to what he was preaching but I climb for myself sometimes just being in the spirit of services when I get inspired for for services and and I and I really start to think about this like you know conquerors and settlers and I believe in the in the message there's a lot more settlers and there are conquerors and I started to think about the thought in in my heart just like Emma do I am I really willing to be a conqueror am i really willing to keep pressing and pressing and pressing and you know that service was the last day before I went to the doctor and ended up finding out about cancer and everything else so it's a special service to me because it's like the Lord pushed me to a point say are you ready to go and conquer are you ready to keep doing this are you happy with where you're at you know are you are you happy with what you've achieved are you happy with the a little space you've carved out or you want to keep going in it I trust by God's grace your answer be the same in mine I want to keep going all the way you know it not not to stop anywhere else not be satisfied anywhere else and so we we actually ended up the service on this scripture last night but Paul says in Romans 8:35 he says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord you know having read that it seems like there is not an enemy around that can stop you and that's the truth but except for one enemy and brother BAM told us this is our greatest enemy you know it's not the devil even though he's a very worthy adversary you know God handcrafted him to be the best adversary we could have but our greatest enemy is ourselves and so when we think of all of these things you know that that angels can't stop us that you know principalities powers the government can't stop you this one can't stop you this army couldn't stop you you know all of these things no other creature could stop you except yourself you can decide at some point I'm not doing this anymore I I'm happy I'm content and when we do that we hold ourselves back so you know really keeping that in mind if we are if our greatest enemy and if we're the only one that can really hinder God then we need to get ourselves out of the way you know we really need need to get ourselves out of the way and and we think about that for the preacher sometimes like all he needs to get himself all the way we think about that for father some time you may be seated sir and I can keep you standing that's a rookie mistake four hours later be like oh man that's a good service doesn't they how come you guys look so tired goodbye but you know we think of that sometimes that you know this you know brother Bob he's sure better we could come prepared tonight you know I better get himself out of the way and get yielded so that we can sing songs that will you know get us in the right atmosphere you know and the preacher better come ready and you know better get himself separated you know and get aside and get the Lord speaking to him and all those things but really all of that's in vain if each person coming doesn't do the same thing you know brother Brown told us that you know you're most of the gift is the pulling on the word but also you know when we think about that is that what kind of condition we bring our heart into church makes such a big difference of what we get out of it you know I I think about the parable of the sower and and that's one of you know I mentioned last night Jesus parables to me and brother Browns stories some of my favorite things because they're just so rich and detailed but Jesus tells the parable of a sower and he talks about all of these different conditions of ground you know and and it's very easy to say oh you know that that ground by the wayside is this person you know or this type of person this ground with the thorns is this type of person to the ground with the rocks it was this type of person and the good the good ground is this person you know cuz that's always the way that we type the parable but really when you think about it and I thought about you know in our in the western Canada where I live is a lot of farmland well all of that land was land by the wayside at one point and you know a lot of it is really good fertile soil now but it didn't get that way just by happening to be good ground it got that way because someone was willing to cut down all of the trees and pull all the stumps and work up the ground and pick all the rocks and and you know kill all of the weeds and burn all of that stuff up and work it up and get it ready to a place where it could actually take in new seed you know sometimes we come in our lives and and we're good ground but take the take good fertile soil and don't do anything with it for a while and all of those we start to grow in again pretty quickly you know all those thorns and thistles and stuff creepin pretty quick so you know we we never want to you know type ourselves and say oh man you know we're we're the bad ground you know where the we're the weedy rocky horrible ground but we do need to realize that it takes effort and it takes work to keep that ground good you know it takes it takes sometimes getting stirred up before we come to service it takes sometimes examining our lives at home and saying what what's growing here you know oh I was expecting to get a good wheat crop and yet there seems to be some fizzles here you know where do we pull those up and and really you know I believe that a Christian life is always in flow because the devil never stops to try and God never stops moving so you know it's never a place where we just stop and stay there but we want to keep moving and so no matter what our situation no matter what difficulty we find ourselves in you know it we need to realize that whatever those trials are God has an end for us that includes victory you know there's there's not a trial that he that he can allow in our lives to prevent us you know in God's God's point is not to give us the trial so that you will prevent us it's to give us a trial so we can overcome with so we can come out on the other side stronger with greater faith greater confidence in him you know greater trust and all of those things so this thought tonight conquerors and settlers is really about that what category do you find yourself in and if you find yourself in the wrong category that doesn't mean oh man I guess you're not making it you know you're you're that chicken in the barnyard you're not the you know you're not the eagle or you know you're you're the the one that's missing out no that's not it at all because we all in us have a have a nature that wants to settle it's only the Holy Ghost nature that keeps conquering and concrete so let's deal with the settlers first us get them out of the way and you know there's positives to the to the word settling and I don't want to discount that and mean if you go search the message for the word settle you'd be like what is this brother talking about here tonight because with every time brother branham uses the word settle he almost always use it in a positive way you know that and so there are some positives to the world words settle and just run through some of the dictionary definitions for you tonight you know that it says to a point fix or resolve definitely and conclusively agree upon that sounds good you know it's a place in a desired state or order that's wonderful you want you know your your affairs to be settled you want God to settle you in his kingdom you know that sounds wonderful to pay as a bill to close an account by payment to pay a bill make a financial arrangement you know all of those things are positive definitions you know brother BAM usually talks about our old account was settled you know like the song long ago long ago the old account was settled long ago and so there are very many positive uses of it and and we can do that but I want to show you it in terms of the contrast with conquering because settling and in some of the definitions I read next really come in to tell you that settling can also be used as a real contrast to conquering you know you came in conquering and then you chose to settle and the the fallout of that you know it produces a different kind of situation entirely so some of the other definitions and I didn't add the the context or the examples they were just in the dictionary but to me they kind of capture it so to migrate to and organize like the pilgrims settled Plymouth to arrange matters in a dispute come to an agreement to settle with a person to come to rest as from flight like a bird that's settled on a bow to gather collect or become fixed in a particular place direction etc a cold settled in my head as the example that they use there to settle down to become established in some routine especially upon marrying so here brother Paul sister Kimberly after a period of Independence or indecision that's a really good way of describing a period of Independence or indecision settle for or be satisfied with to settle for less and settle into or become established in to settle into a new routine you know when you think about these contextual examples that it gives here you know you start to see that there might be some things especially you bring it over into the spiritual that are negative with this word settle you know to migrate and to organize that sounds good until you apply it spiritually and you found that anything that organizes dies you know it's wonderful when you're singing the move is on the move is on my lover we're moving and moving and then when we stop and we organize and we get everything settle and you know everything's in place and everybody's happy and and all of that that's when God's Spirit just keeps moving on and that that group starts to die spiritually you know and so as much as it sounds wonderful the end result of that is a stagnant cold church that no longer moves with the Spirit of God to arrange matters in a dispute or come to an agreement you know that sounds wonderful you know it's settled until you think that many people have settled with the devil they've come to an agreement and their agreement is devil you know I want to go to church and I want to do this and I want to do this but the rest of the time I'll give to you or devil I'm willing to go this far but I'm willing to compromise here and I'm willing to compromise there and I'm willing to give you your place and time and and all of that kind of thing they've they've settled with the devil and they have an understanding and because they're not putting too much pressure on him he gives them space to be comfortable you know they come to an agreement I'm willing to go this far and a lot of times that's what what church becomes is that you know as long as the preachers talking about the things that you've been willing to go you know that far then you say oh amen amen I'm with you brother you know I'm right beside you and then the brother goes just a little further and it goes hush quiet because you know I wasn't willing to go that far you know I'm willing to go as far as I've come today and you know a lot of times that's that's the situation it's you know if we were to if we were to talk about the past and what God's brought us through you know all of us can rejoice in that and all of us you know say oh that's wonderful maybe we have so many testimonies we could you know just spend the evening discussing those and sharing those and that'd be wonderful but to talk about do we still have that same kind of passion to keep moving forward because you know I don't know about you but I'm not in a glorified body tonight and I'm not I'm not in a different dimension so there's still somewhere else to go from here you know there's still there's still steps that need to be taken and and we're not gonna get there by you know having an understanding with the devil the only understanding he needs to have is get out of my way because I'm still moving on you know I'm not making any deals here I'm I'm I'm moving on pressing on all the way to the end to come to rest us from flight you know that oh that's wonderful you know we talked about there's a rest for the bride there's a rest but I thought you know and I love the way that I said that as a bird to come you know it settle upon a bow you know we're not supposed to be settled on a bow you know we talk about the the annoying thing that's part of of our age you know it's not II what kind of anointing it is it's an eagle anointing you know and and you know of course a lot of you know pictures or whatever they they show an eagle and perch majestically in a tree and you think that's wonderful but I'm glad that you know the the Bible doesn't tell us that it's just an eagle but it tells us that the anointings are flying you you know it's not a resting angle it's not an eagle that's perched and you know just checking things out just you know it's an eagle that's meant to be up there in the heavenlies soaring on those currents and and you know in motion aloft and alert is not supposed to be resting and sitting down on the ground you know it's supposed to be up there doing something in the heavenly updrafts you know so when we when we think about that you know those those connotations are are just you know they sound good but they're just they're just speaking of something that's different than the Commission we've been given settle down and become routine you know with routine comes some loss of passion routine comes some loss of zeal you know when when you you know when you when you have a routine and say everybody knows okay everybody knows is Monday morning Monday mornings workday cakes I got to be up at this time lunch gonna be made and everything's kids gotta get ready for school everything's got to go and everybody works according to the routine but whether you're excited about work or school you're not you can go through the routine anyway you know whether it brings you any joy at all or at the end of the day you're already looking forward to the end of the day that routine just keeps you going you know and church can become such a routine serving God can be such a routine and we do it like why we going to church today death oh you know what Sunday you know we're supposed to you know it's it's Wednesday we're supposed to you know not not because we want to or not because you know there's there's a passion there anymore but because we want you why do we pray for our food well because you know we've always prayed for our food you know why do we you know what do we do this because well we've always done that what why don't why do we have luck here well you know the sisters have always had long hair you know it's not supposed to be a routine it's supposed to be something that's genuine and passionate and and that there's a personal reason that we've chosen to do that you know that's just like the story of the the man who marries a wife and and you know every time you know she she goes to cook or oh she cuts you know one one piece of the roast off and sets it in beside the the rest of it and you know he asks her like why did you do that like my my my mom never cooked a roast like that she always just put the whole roast in and and cooked in it I always turned out great she said I don't know my mom always did it that way so one day she asked her mom why don't we do it that way and said well I don't know my mom always taught me to do that way so you know my mom always did that so you know go back and ask grandma and when when you go far back enough grandma just didn't have a big enough pan for the roast so she always cut one part off and and stuck it in beside and so you know we can do a lot of things because it's routine we can do a lot of things because somebody did it that way at one time you know and you know it's kind of funny to me sometimes going to different churches and I haven't been to a lot but the ones that I've gone to there's so many different ways of doing foot washing and communion and in so many different ways of you know even how the service goes and the musicians and everything else and I think that is good for us to go and get exposure to different places sometimes because otherwise we think that you know the way that we do it is just the right way to do everything and you know I've sat in the seat of the scornful as they say sometimes you know sitting in different church like oh why do they do it that way that's just you know that's just totally wrong and they start thinking why is it wrong it's right it's wrong because it's a different routine then you know then what I'm used to right and so we can get in that routine experience and we can get that way to the point where you know we judge other people because they don't fit our routine we you know we have a hard time with everything else just because it doesn't fit our routine that's a very dangerous position to be in because God might shake things up one day and you're like ah what are you doing god I have a routine here don't don't mess with the routine I just want to you know I'm just gonna go with my happy little way here God's trying to get our attention sometimes you know and so when you think about that routine that's that's the way a lot of people come to Christ they've they've swapped one lifestyle for another lifestyle you know where they used to they're your routine used to take them out partying on Saturday unite and instead it takes them to church on Sunday morning you know the routine used to take them you know watching TV in the evening now they listen to a message or they read their Bible or they have some family devotions and they just swapped the routine but really they're just going through the motions either way so you know we don't want that kind of life we want a life that's much more vibrant than that and then that last definition is settle for less or be satisfied with your current condition you know and I believe that for the church relate Asiya that's that's really what the Bible speaks about you don't need anything they've got already got at all of if they're in a place where they don't need anything at all including God you don't really even need the Lord anymore because they've got you know everything's established and they got all the message books and they got the Bible and they got all the resources you know so we don't need anything else you know and Jesus is on the outside knocking it say you know what about me you know remember I was the main thing that we talked about last night you know I'm I'm the one that put all this in place and we're saying you know I know but you know we're pretty satisfied with this you know it's just sad condition to be him brother BAM says whenever I'm now all of us know that whenever a message is given in three years they formal organization when they do that it kills it right there it did it in the days of Luther so it did it in the days of Wesley it did in the days of Alexander Campbell and all the rest of them and I did it in the days of Pentecost exactly see you get to a place each one gets starchy and gets off and they can't receive new revelation they're settled down and there they are and there they die and the life goes right through that goes right on to make the wheat and when the wheat comes that life that's traveled through that wheat the resurrection brings the whole thing out brings up for the rapture you know that idea that no matter what word fresh word I'm a you know you know passion that that fresh kill of the word you know that the fresh eagle food goes forth and for a while people eat that and they enjoy it and everything else and then they settle down and say you know that's that's where I stop you know I I've noticed this pattern over my life that you know people whatever age they they embrace technology they kind of just stay at that place you know it just as you get older you always filter everything through what was fresh to you at that point you know and I worked in IT for a while and you could always tell the people that have burned around not just because they're great hair you could always tell the people have been around for a long time because every time they would make an example explaining something of how to troubleshoot it would go back to the days of you know floppy disks and you know really old technology that wasn't around anymore and they would start from there and try to add-on because at some point that was the limitation of their experience and everything new that they're trying to figure out is based on that old experience and you see that sometimes with in the message that you see that same kind of thing is that wherever somebody came to Christ that fixes their their revelation it just kind of sets it and now anything that anybody preaches guys to grind through the gears you know of where the message was at the time that they came to Christ instead of you know as Paul says you know forgetting the things in the past or moving on from the first principles it's not that those things are bad or they were we're actually giving them up but we're building onto those you know new revelation new understanding and realizing that you know even though you know the the message that we read in that and the things that were the quotes that we read are still from you know in the 1960s and 1950s that there's still a progression in the word there's still a growth in the word and so we can't still think about things you know in the days that they were in the 1960s we have to think about things in the way they are in 2017 and realize what's God doing today and not not keep shifting back oh man how does this fit all the way back to here but you say yes or no that's where I want to be I want to be right where everything's moving today Israel and the journey from Egypt to me is the prime example of people subtly you know they had every possible opportunity to conquer and to completely wipe out all opposition to them and you think about you know this this group of a couple of million people has brother Brown described it you know that had supernatural power behind them they had prophecy behind them you know all the way back to Abraham saying that you know you see to a sojourn in a strange land and I'll bring them back they had motivation behind them because they had been in in slavery and in bondage and so they had everything to motivate them to go out and and just accomplish everything that God had for them and yet every single opportunity they had they chose to settle instead they settled for less they settled for the easy way they settle for a selfish satisfaction you know and we know you know Bubba have talked about it that it should have been only like a three-week journey from from Egypt into the Promised Land you know and different scholars have looked and seeing you know the difference of the distance and how long it should have taken there's different estimates and all of those things but whatever we know we know it shouldn't have taken 40 years you know we know that about a year in is when they when they you know stood at at Kish Barnea waiting to go over and to see you know what would kind of be there and so it was a very easy thing that they should have been there much sooner but we find out that every time God bring them to a place they didn't say like okay how long we stay in here because we're ready to keep going into the you know towards the promised land now every time they came to a place they were grouchy every time they came to a place they were complaining every time they came to a place they found something wrong with they instead of something right you know those the victories that they had that they had come through the Red Sea and you know they had a great time praising the Lord and worshiping and thanking him for you know bringing them through and their enemies all you know wiped out and everything else they're so excited and then it's just a few days later well where's the water where's the food where is this where is that didn't you know in every step of the way did you bring us here to die did you bring us here to die you know what more to God have to do for them you know we always think you know I've thought there's many times and that I've heard people say this you know if only there was more supernatural you know if there was only more supernatural things you know they would encourage us and they would give us faith and you know it would be a wonderful thing if you know God was still doing all the miraculous things that he was doing on a daily basis and brother Brian's ministry but let me tell you it wouldn't give you any more faith and you me say God I don't know if I agree with that well look at Israel is the prime example of that is that God was doing supernatural things every single day and it required so little effort on their part to make any of them happen and yet did it fill them with faith no it didn't it actually made them grumble more and more and more and the more that God gave them the even less they wanted to do for themselves and so it really teaches me a lot when you look at the human nature is that we think why doesn't God just hand it to us because we'd be even lazier than we are now you know why doesn't God make it you know that much more you know why is my financial situation this much easier why are my kids this much you know sweeter why isn't this you know church that much better because we'd be even lazier and sometimes we come to church and we're not feeling it so we try a little harder you know we worship a little harder we we participate a little bit more and guess what sometimes those are the best services you know even as a minister many times you come in and you feel oh man I got service all ready to go tonight it should be wonderful and you know and anything well I just didn't feel like it went over but the day that you come and you're struggling you think oh I'm not ready for this service and I and I just don't know if I caught the mind to the Lord and everything else and you depend on God and then it becomes a real sweet service and you know I need a touch of somebody's life and you say that's really what it's about is just coming ready to do something and fight and struggle and God honors that God doesn't like it when we sit back say okay do something for me Lord he wants us to be fighting and struggling along with it so it's not the amount of supernatural you know so many people will say that in science even they would say you know show me God and not believer and then you can show them evidence of miraculous healing and all these amazing things that they can't explain and they just go like well you know I just can't quite understand I just couldn't quite believe it you know that it can be rationalized somehow you know it like what is it it's not the problem that they haven't seen enough it's that they don't have any faith because faith is not being convinced of something faith is the evidence you know if things not seeing it's a substance of you know of things not seen so it doesn't come from being explained how it all works out it comes from trusting and believing that God's keeping his promise that God's Word is true you know I had had somebody that I talked to one time not to digress too much but you know a young denominational man he was telling me all about how you know the time of Noah and I said he said do you know about the time of Noah I said well yeah I know but Noah built the ark and you know any and all the animals went into the ark and and you know God sent the flood and all that he's like he's like yeah but do you know why it never rains up until that time you know why I never in it I don't know far as I know the Bible didn't say anything about why didn't rain he said well you know we believe that there was a huge canopy of foliage that covered the earth you know and they trapped the moisture so it never formed any clouds or anything like that and you know that's why the dew watered the earth and everything and I said yeah I'm like wow you know that's interesting but like do you have to believe that in order to believe that Noah had an ark and that you know because if we can explain it all away it doesn't take any faith to believe it you know if you can prove it all out and you have a scientific explanation for anything everything then you know you don't have to have any faith but you know I don't understand how all of those animals fit in the ark I don't understand how all of the animals knew it was time to go there but I believe that it happened because God's Word said it did you know I don't necessarily understand how every part of creation worked or how any part of creation worked other than God said it and took place but I believe that it happened the way that God said that it happened you know so faith doesn't require us you know it doesn't require us to completely turn off our mind to say I just believe anything anybody tells me but there's something in faith that is always going to be required that we believe it because God said it and because it resonates with that soul inside of us so finally after 40 years and mistake after mistake and settle after settle after settle you know the most famous settling was when they came to the border they sent out the spies you know they found out that the land was just as good as God promised it it was just as wonderful as God promised it but it was going to take some battles like oh well we don't really want to fight those battles and what if we lose some of those battles and what if those battles are really hard and we heard those those guys are really big and strong and all of those things and so of course they settled for a wilderness experience 40 years instead of being in the Promised Land 40 years and finally we know that that generation is dying off the judgment that God gave them that that they would you know perish they would not be able to go in and see the Promised Land because of their disbelief and and all those things and so 40 years later they're finally you know willing to make the transition to a conquering nation all the old settlers are dead just a few left Moses and still around at that point and you know how there must have been so much excitement and enthusiasm and sometimes we get in that same kind of you know excitement and enthusiasm when we think about the rapture cycle because there's been a lot of year since brother Ram passed off the scene you know and there's a lot of low times in there where it doesn't feel like God moving it doesn't feel like we're really getting closer to that you know there's there's some of those lulls sometimes where it just feels like things are stagnant and not moving and and not growing not progressing to that place you know but then a couple things happen in the world and there's a new war and we get excited as new war you know there's rumors of wars and you know there's and there's an earthquake do you supposed to be earthquakes in diverse places I mean we started to get excited you know and things like that and we start to think that that you know this could be it you maybe you see the government system or you hear the preaching of the word hopefully is that the the most important thing that's telling you you know where we're at that time we're at that place it's time to get ready and we start to get excited we start to sense a shift a new opportunity to conquer as we should you know and right in that moment I stumbled across the scripture a while back and right in that moment where new songs were being written you know preparations are being made for them to go into this promised land finally and they're getting all excited and there's victory in a camp and all of that and God takes Moses aside to give him a little song for the children of Israel and I thought what a oh this is gonna be amazing you know could you imagine if if you know brother Bob got up and said the Lord gave me the words for this song and and the music for this song we're gonna sing this song tonight the God gave us to get ready for the rapture and you would say oh praise the Lord I am ready to hear that song what is it like let me hear the opening chords on the on the piano let me let me hear you know brother Paul strum it a little bit here you know let me hear you know brother Adam bang that I would and let me let me hear brother brother Joe you know clunking along there on the bass and you know and and all of those things that I want to hear don't hear brother Bob strike that first note and you know I want it's going to be amazing well the Lord gives Moses a song for the children of Israel and this is a song excision in Deuteronomy 31 verse 14 and Lord said unto Moses behold thou thy days approached that must die called Joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation that I may give him a charge in Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation and the Lord appeared in the tabernacle on a pillar of a cloud and the pillar of a cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle and the Lord said unto Moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whether they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with them then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and I will forsake them and I will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and trouble shall befall them so that they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they have wrought and in that they are turned unto other gods now therefore write you this song for them for you and teach it the children of Israel and put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel for when I shall have brought them into the which I swear unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and wax in fact then they will return then they will turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenant and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for I know their imagination which they go about even now before I have brought them into the land which I swear Moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught at the children of Israel and he gave Joshua the son of nun of charge and said be strong and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swear unto them and I will be with thee sorry it wasn't a very happy song you know but they they probably thought you know this is this is wonderful we're all excited we're going into this place it's going to be so amazing we're never gonna have another problem we're just gonna roll through this Promised Land and God gives them this song instead and it's a very sobering song you know to say that you're gonna settle you're gonna go into this land and you're gonna have some victory and you're gonna carve out a new life for yourselves and then you're gonna settle down and you're gonna look at the gods of the people around you and you're gonna start to adopt their behavior and you're gonna start to take the easy way and you're gonna realize it's easier to make friends with these guys than it is to be fighting with them and you're just gonna compromise and compromise and compromise you know I thought what what a sobering thing to tell a people that's ready to go in and conquer what God knows his people well you know everyone was probably singing when the battles over we shall wear a crown you know I'm bound for the promised land and God Himself gives them a song to sing you know and I thought it's interesting that he never gave it a title you know we always like the title I don't know what scene and I thought you know what he'd have been called the settler song The Ballad of the backslider you know the psalm of the sinned six souls I don't know they're you know something with a nice ring to it but you know the message behind it it was a pretty pretty sobering one and he taught it to them think about that we sing the songs you know that we sing it and they're usually rejoicing songs you know remembering good things all that and he teaches them a song to remind them so that one day when they're singing you know how we're tracing the gods of this land and you know they can look around and say we are chasing the gods of this land you know we have let all this evil befall us we have let all of these things come to us you know in God in His mercy gives them that knowledge that warning before they even go into the land you know before they they've even made a single compromise he's already told them this is what's gonna happen beware you know be be warned and brother Brown tells us warning then judgment God always gives us a warning before judgment just his grace to us and it doesn't surprise us with the judgment at the end he tells us what the pitfalls are in the land he gave them judgment you know all of all the people of Israel that are mentioned who left Egypt all of them there's only two that we that are really recorded as conquerors you know that brother Brown when he preaches the message one in a million he comes back to that over and over again you know two million people left Egypt and only two people really were conquerors or two were really those ones one in a million you know Joshua and Caleb and and I think it's special that one of them was in the ministry and one of them was in the congregation you know that you know who were never satisfied with their present condition and who pressed forward who were faithful witnesses encouraging others to conquer and also conquering in their own lives and you know when that last verse said you know he told Joshua the son of nun you know be strong enough a good courage no wonder he told him that you know he had just given him a song that said these people are gonna give up and compromise and settle down and all of these things yeah oh yeah and you're the new guy in charge by the way you know that's a pretty daunting task right and so you you read a you know the first chapter of Joshua and and God just comes and tells him time and time again be strong and have a good courage I'm with you you know as I was with Moses over and over and over again and you start to think about that you know Joshua was thinking like wait as he was with Moses they're trying to kill Moses half the time you know they're they're trying to stone Moses they were rebelling against Moses all the time is this really the job that I want because it'd be strong and of good courage and and Joshua just kept pressing on and you know the book of Joshua is not an easy steamroll into the into the country and never have any problems you know there's problem after problem after problem that still comes up in that time you know time is when they got complacent times when they made peace with the Gibeonites when they shouldn't have they should have conquered them but they know they didn't pray about that they didn't they didn't seek the Lord I said you know they came with old clothes and moldy bread and said you know we're you know we've come from so far away and we just want to make peace with you and if we come to find out you know they they come from so far away like you know 20 miles down the road and they had you know they had deceived them and it said that they hadn't sought the Lord so you know it wasn't that they went through without any trouble but it was it was a progress that was moving on and moving on and moving on and you find a long way in you know that Joshua is still saying there's much land to be possessed there's much land to be possessed and when you look at what they really achieved they didn't achieve all the left you know they didn't drive out all the enemies there was a lot of land that still was left to be possessed you know but but Joshua also knew this he could not change the heart of a settler he could not change the heart of a settler but he proclaimed with fierceness the heart of a conqueror that was in his own chest and and he says here in Joshua 24:15 he says and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father's served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the hammerites and whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord you know that's a that's a strong statement in that time when you know people all around we're making peace and and saying oh it's easier to pull tribute than it is to fight these people it's you know it's easier to benefit from them than to fight against them but Joshua said choose you what you're gonna do but ask for me in my we're still gonna keep doing that you know if you want to look at examples in the church or examples in the message and see people who are compromised and people that are made peace with the devil and you know people that have come to a certain place and settled down and think that well everybody else is doing it that's not going to help you at all but when you realize that in spite of all of those things there's still a choice for you choose you this day what you're gonna do but as for me in my house I'm gonna serve the Lord you know there's far too much of this stuff that happens and especially in this information age or misinformation age as I call it that you know you see somebody else doing something you see oh man this pastor on the internet he allows this or you know this person does this so did you know that so-and-so does this so you know so-and-so has this tradition SONA and what we do is become collectors of these things and like well this person is doing it so must be okay and this person is doing this it must be okay but know what what's the thing is that God's not holding you accountable for somebody else's life he's holding you a camo for what you have in your own life Caleb he saw the mixed success that people were having you know they would drive out a certain people make peace you know and then settle and become satisfied with their circumstances and Caleb Fleming he helped many other people fight for their inheritance before he thought of his own inheritance you know you could look you've been in the land for already five years before Caleb comes in to see Joshua his own inheritance he's you know he's 85 years old when he comes to see him and and do the math and they've already been there for a while but what Caleb finally realized is that you know what I've helped a lot of people and a lot of people have not bothered to go all the way I'm gonna go and get my land now you know sometimes we say that's selfish but you know we have to be selfish to make sure that our spiritual walk is right first before we can help somebody else that jesus said take take the beam out of your own eye before you get the motive somebody else's we can see we can get so busy sometimes helping other people that our own spiritual walk suffers you know so busy thinking of others were willing to go over on their ground to try to reach them and we get off of the ground that we should be standing on so so Caleb after five years finally he comes and he sees Joshua and he said now behold the LORD hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old as yet I am I as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord spake in that day for thou hardest in the day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord be with me that I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord had said you know I hope we can see it it's a pretty clear difference between the settlers and the conquerors you know and I pray like like Joshua and Caleb lived an example that it inspires and it speaks more conquerors into existence the more we talk about this to say you know what I have been settling I have been you know taking the easy way but I want to keep pressing in I want to keep conquering that the settlers heart will be quickened to be a conqueror because their example did inspire other people to keep going you know but Caleb looked at this if you look at his inheritance Caleb did not choose the easiest place he's 85 year-old man you know and he says he was the same as he was when he was he's 40 years old but you know I'm sure in his body he'd gotten a little more tired he got a little more a week you know maybe lost little muscle mass maybe you know all of those things but the heart hadn't changed you know the desire the the zeal hadn't changed and so he said I'm as strong today as I was back then and so Caleb doesn't choose you know a nice easy land he chooses a mountain for one thing you know you know you know amount you guys know all about rock here you don't you know you know find that to be oh this will be the easiest place to build a house is right here on this you know big chunk of rock or this would be the easiest place to grow vegetables or raise animals you know on a big chunk of rock so a difficult place to do that you know you see even here building how you blast everything out of the rock it's difficult work expensive all of those things but that's what what Caleb wanted he didn't say now give me my valley you know give me my retirement home he said give me my mountain and not only that but didn't just pick a mountain that nobody else had any interested in he picked a mountain with the biggest Giants you know the ones that were the most intimidating so where the fences were walled and you know all of these things where the cities were walled and so he he picks that place this old guy that you know should be should be going for the easier life that's the place he picks he says that's the inheritance guy wanted that's what God promised me give me my mountain you know and when he said give me my mountain it didn't mean you know send with me a you know twenty five thousand people to go take this mountain it's like no let me know that I can go take it and I will go in there and he says if the Lord will be with me I will conquer it that's a powerful statement for a man who'd already suffered many things it already helps so many others but he was willing to do it you know if you look at at most groups you know in any industry any aspect of life you know most people will not truly ever have the will of a conqueror they'll achieve success and varying measures and and at some point though make peace that well this is about as good as it gets you know this is this is the extent of my ability this is the extent of my opportunity you know and make peace with their limitations and you know settle for what they believe is realistic they become satisfied with that you know you could take that any kind of industry any kind of group of people you always find the majority of people will get to that place you know and and like most people we can be that way sometimes too you know when when there's a you know an active conflict we're all you know oh let's go get em and everything else but you know when the conflict passes then we relax and get comfortable again you know as soon as the danger passes we say oh you know yeah well that wasn't so bad let's try I'm so glad that trials over and now we can just take a little time off you know I'm so I'm so glad that the difficulty has passed now we can just rest and relax you know but that's not really the heart of a conqueror yeah that's the heart of a settler who is kind of forced to get up off the couch when trouble arose you know and so you know kind of like you know you could say someone like or mine left me completed the one that grabbed the Ox code and and and went after the enemy you know after the Philistine Shamgar thank you you know he had he didn't let it go and go and go and go and go and finally he can't take it anymore and he grabs the Ox coat and and he goes and slays and has victory and and brings deliverance to his family but it took an awful lot to get him to go because it really wasn't enough to just go out and fight the enemy and take it to him he really had to be prodded and prodded look at someone like Samson Samson had all the power and ability by God's gift to completely annihilate the Philistines Samson had never been defeated in any conflict you know no matter what they did no matter what the numbers were no matter how many people they brought against him no matter how you no good their equipment was and how poor his own equipment was every situation that Samson got into where he went you know face to face toe-to-toe with an enemy he won every single battle and it didn't take you know it didn't take a lot of effort it didn't seem like you know he could just do whatever you wanted and show up in the middle of the battle and and have victory time and time and time again you know did he bring deliverance to Israel yeah in some circumstances he did but if you look at the heart of Samson he was a settler you know inside of him he was a settler he took the easy way every single time you know and sometimes the deliverance he brought to Israel was almost accidental you know it's like it is almost accidental you read through some of his exploits and you know it's not because Samson said let me go and drive out the enemy he was like Samson got himself in trouble and the enemy came to him and you know he's in a really difficult situation they never should have been in in the first place and you know in that moment where you know you really should have been slaughtered for his foolishness you know God God gives him deliverance and he and he's still able to overcome the enemy you know Samson's wildest exploits either come when he's gotten himself in trouble following the lust of his flesh or when he's angry and having a temper tantrum you know and he's been personally shamed those are the times when he has the most victory you know what a shame if that was our testimony that the the most victory he has is when we put ourselves in a bad situation and you know the most times we have victory is you know when we've been embarrassed or humiliated you know when Samson's own life is in danger that's when he finally steps up to the challenge and the rest of his life is just settling after settling after settling you know and he look at it Sampson was raised up as a judge over Israel God had a purpose for his life to give them deliverance to give them strength to you know to drive out their enemy to set an example before them and yet his own willing to miss to compromise and his complacency robbed him of personal victory and reward time and time again and you know it's it remarkable to me you look at the story as it unfolds with Delilah and I didn't I didn't put it all in here to save time tonight but you know he he settled himself in the arms of Delilah too many times and she never proved herself worthy of that you know every single time that he gave her a reason you know why he had this strength she wouldn't took advantage of it immediately you know she she never proved any kind of trustworthiness she never proved that you know she could handle it she didn't prove any of those things you know she was on his side every time she said what is this Samson he says Oh oh wow you know you know you know I've never had new cords on me before you know it's always these old ropes that's the problem you know so you know immediately these new ropes show up but you know when Samson falls asleep he wakes up in these he's bound by these ropes you know what did you think was gonna happen and and just time after time but yet you see that same pattern in the lives of Christians today that's what makes me sad is that you know we look at Samson and and you know we can look at his story and say what an idiot like sometimes we can think like how did he possibly not realize where this was headed how did he possibly not realize that as he got closer and closer and closer to giving away the secret that she was just gonna keep testing the intestine until he until he lost but we do the same thing so many times we've been given a Holy Ghost power that has never been defeated that could drive the devil into complete despair but the bottom tells us we can live a life that the devil doesn't know what to do with us so many times the devil knows exactly what to do with us you know and the devil knows exactly what to do with us and just like Delilah you know having Samson sleep upon her knees that's you know that's what the devil does to us just lulls us back to sleep like oh you know grab your phone grab your computer you know just relax you know just entertain yourself you know you just you know just just let away the cares of the world and then you know we just thought that sound good yeah that's just rest it's been a hard day it's been a long day stressed out I just need to have an escape and before we know it well where's all the power of prayer you know where does all the power of strength in our lives where's the joy where's the victory it just kind of fades away on Delilah's knees the casualties of settling are piling up all around us you know and it didn't show up years ago I'm not sure why I guess just sowing and reaping but the casualties are piling up in this message a lot of people have walked away that we never expected to walk away a lot of people have given up a lot of people have been confused a lot of people have been overcome and they're piling up more than they ever had before it you know some of have backslidden some have completely fallen away and sometimes we we can get very self-righteous about that and we can think oh man that you know I guess they were just serpent seed or I guess they you know they just weren't really children of God or make believers whatever we want to cast them off as I've heard people cannon fodder all those things but you know maybe maybe we've been sowing some of those same seeds and they just haven't reaped out yet because for a lot of them they went a lot of years - they went a lot of years coming to church singing songs shaking hands saying amen and it took a long time before they got to that place where you know there was no more power in their life where there was no more strength in their life where too many cares of life had choked out their experience you know where too many pressures are common so you know before we get too confident we need to make sure that we haven't been sowing those same things and they just haven't reaped out yet the testimony of Joshua Caleb as we turn to more to the thought of the conquerors because that's that's where we want to get to we don't want to be focusing on all the settlers unless we realize oh man there's some settling to me let's stop doing that but the testimony of Joshua and Caleb and and the other over comers in the promised land is that the people stayed true until those conquerors had died you know the people in Israel and in the promised land sorry the children of Israel the promised land they they were pretty faithful and true until Joshua and Caleb died and in the next generation was really where they stopped following those things they were there was no new conquerors that raised up there was no new conquerors that that you know kept giving them that same kind of strength and that same kind of victory and saying you know here we go and God would raise up a a judge and they would all rally for the judge the judge passed away and they all settled again and they'd run themselves into that same condition and so I believe that's why it's so important why the body of Christ needs ministry and laity that will stand as conquerors I set an example for others to follow because you know as much as we say we're all following Christ but Paul said follow me as I follow Christ know there has to be examples of someone that you can put your trust in and say I want to keep praying like that brothers pray I want to keep pushing like that brother expression I want to keep struggling like that brother struggling in his in his trials in his situation because I know if he can do it I can keep going you know as much as we'd all love to be you know David facing down Goliath there's not that many David's you know there was a lot of people out on the battlefield as we talked about a little bit last night and brother Joe brother but there was only one David but what happened when David went and defeated Goliath there you know there was only one man that was willing to step up and do that but when that one man stepped up and fought Goliath and won victory the rest of them jumped right into the battle you know the rest of them realized hey if he can do it I can be a part of this and so the children of Israel rose up and they chased and pursued the Philistines and they had a great victory because one man was willing to step up and conquer you know I believe there's a lot of people who can be like that army of Israel that saw David defeat Goliath and then charged into battle follow the examples of the conquerors around you and you can conquer as well you know follow those examples find that one myth that's pressing don't don't get distracted by all the people that aren't oppressing follow find someone that is pressing you'll find a brother or a sister that you can say I want to be like that I want to be more like that I want to have more dedication I want to keep pressing and when you find that just keep going just keep following that example and they'll help you to keep going help help you to get that conquerors mentality going on you know Samson he had that one great victory when he finally subjected his will and was willing to wait lay down his life after spending his whole life living for himself when he was willing to subject himself great victory was wrought and he conquered the Philistines in a greater way than he ever had before but you know being a true Conqueror is not about individual victories it's not about having some success you know because you can have plenty of individual victories and still be a settler you know you look at like the time of the great battles and wars have been fought you know both sides had plenty of individual victories but there was still a winner and a loser in the war and so you know we can get complacent sometimes because when we have a bunch of victories in a row we start to think oh this Devils nothing you know you really is a bluff yeah I don't even have to hardly try you know and the devil is a master at setting up easy victories for you sometimes you come to church on Sunday and man just knocking that devil aside wow this is so easy wow it's like he's not even trying well he isn't really he's he's just setting you up I said oh yeah don't worry you overcame look at you you yay family was great today the kids were wonderful everything that was perfect you're just such a good parent and now you just doing everything right and man you know that that brother says something to you should have set you off but you conquered your temper you are amazing wow look at you go you know and the devil is just getting you ready giving you a victory after victory after victory and then you'll hit you with the tough stuff you know right when you you're complacent right when you you think everything's going well that's when he hit you with the hard trials that's when he hit me with the big punches you know that you realized he was just throwing a few jabs and here comes you know the haymaker here comes the knockout punch because the devil's a master doing those things but you know to me the difference between a conqueror and a settler is that it's not about our individual victories that gives us confidence it's that we know we're not there yet it doesn't matter how many victories have already been won if we're still not at the destination then there's still more to do you know we're not resting on anything because we haven't really accomplished anything until we get to the destination you know if if I was on my way here to Newfoundland and we got the Toronto say all oh praise the Lord that was a good flight I'm so glad we made it and I'm just gonna stop here you know and everything else look how far we've come from Edmonton we've come so far already wow what a what a great trip we've had you know we would we don't be like halfway here or two thirds of the way here but but man look at all the distance we covered we never got to the destination you know you have to you have to get all the way there you have to go all the way there and if you think about your own life when you feel you have victory over your temper over temptation over the flesh what does that produce does it produce a greater urgency to keep pressing to the rapture or does it produce complacency you know most of the time it produces complacency you know when we have victory we get relaxed and we get lazy and the devil doesn't have to fight you constantly to win battles over you he just has us to fight to gain a little ground and then get you all worked up you know like Samson you know Samson you know he he would get all worked up and he'd go out and do his great big work and then he relax again and the devil would just take a little more and then he would fight it and and then he would you give back a little bit more you know and till he he really didn't find out that he had lost the battle until he had already lost it you know it's already already lost his sight till he already you know got to that place and you know and he back to Israel Israel surrendered more and more land to their enemies every year you know every year they they fought those battles and they thought they were making progress and their enemy just kept taking a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more you know to find out in the time of David you know for as much as Israel occupied their enemy's occupied most of the land you know they have really been subdued you know why does that comment comes from years of settling years of getting complacent years of fighting a few battles and then giving up spiritual settlers will always be further from God in the long run and the reason for that is because the Holy Spirit is the true Conqueror the Holy Spirit is never going to be standing still the Holy Spirit is never going to say this is good enough well you guys have have been in the message 20 years now 30 years now 40 years now way to go that's wonderful you know we don't need to do anything more with you know the Holy Spirit we'll keep pressing and saying you know you've been here 40 years but just a little longer just a little longer because if you think this is great what I've got for you next is gonna be so much better than what you're at right now you know you're still in this body think about how great it will be when you're in a glorified body you're still in this world but you know think about what's coming in the world to come you know all of those things and the Holy Spirit is never gonna stop conquering and so if we settle only part of the time we're gonna get further behind all of the time you know if we settle if we settle only 10% of the time we're following 10% behind you know where God's moving all the time so it's really in our best interest it's really the the call of the Spirit of God I believe is keep pressing keep pressing keep pressing in the end it really comes down to whether or not the mind of Christ is in us you know because if it is we'll we'll keep conquering and we won't be happy subtly will keep striving because we have no inheritance in this world you know I know the pressures that are exist that way to carve out a comfortable place for yourself you know this is your little spot this is your house this is your car it's your kids this is you know where everybody's at it's nice and comfortable but that's not our home that's not our place you know it's not about getting our business to a certain spot it's not about getting our families to a certain spot we could gain everything in this world and we will still not have reached the goal that God has for our lives so if we don't have the mind of Christ on us we will be content to settle eventually it'll show up in our attitude you might have read this scripture before but to me it really captures this thought nicely second Kings chapter 13 said now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness where he died and joash the king of Israel came down unto Him and wept over his face and said o my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and surprisingly enough that's actually a very good compliment you know the my my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen there I was a very honorable thing to say if you said it to your brother now they probably can get it but you know it's just that it was very noble thing that he he did a give him respect and everything and Elijah said unto Him take bow and arrows and he took unto Him bow and arrows and he said to the king of Israel put down hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and Elijah put his hand upon the Kings hand and he said open the window eastward and he opened it then Elijah said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for thou shalt smite the Syrians and effect till they have thou have consumed them and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of Israel smite upon the ground and he smoked thrice and stayed stopped and the man of God was wroth with him and said thou should have smitten five or six times then a stout smitten Syria till thou has consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice joash the king did not have the mind of a conqueror he had the mind of a settler God wants to deliver Israel from their enemy in Assyrians he wants to drive them out it is God's perfect will you know we wonder sometimes this is a God's perfect will we knew it was God's perfect will because he sent the prophet Elijah to tell joash specifically that God wanted him to have victory over Syria so he knew without a doubt thus saith the Lord and it's a perfect will of God for them to have victory over Syria you know and if you think about predestination and people put a lot of stock on predestination per destination means that God said a will for you knowing that you would respond to you know God set a destiny knowing that you would respond to his word because Bob taught us that you know and the Bible says it as well that it's because of God's foreknowledge that he creates a destiny for you that he predestinated you you know it's a lot of people say I'm predestinated and they do nothing that proves they're they're not very predestinated because being predestinated means that you're going to respond to the word and the spirit that God pours out him knowing that he creates a destiny for you and so you know Elijah basically tells joash here what god's predestinated will is for his life it is to have victory over the Syrians and Elijah gives him a symbol of it and it's actually beautiful is his hands overtop of the Kings hands you know in other words you know God's prophet leading God's people into victory in it is a beautiful symbol there and Elijah clearly tells joash these arrows symbolize their victory over Syria you know there's nothing mysterious about it there's nothing that difficult to understand you know joash did really good when Elisha told him exactly what to do you know joash did really well when I'll actually told him every single detail take the bow and arrow he took the bow and arrow open the window he opened the window you know fire the arrow he fired the arrow he did really good with step-by-step directions of every single thing that he should do but when all I should tell him to take the arrows and smite upon the ground he doesn't tell him how many times this might he doesn't tell him how hard to smite it's a test of his character it's a test of his character he's already told them every other step along the way but he just says take the arrows and smite on the ground and so he actually reveals the character of the King in this moment is he gonna be a conqueror or is he gonna be a settler and unfortunately joash is a settler he takes he follows Elijah's instructions but he doesn't have the heart of a conqueror you know he takes a few swipes of the ground with the arrows and then he settles like oh I'm supposed to have a part in this okay well okay one two three is that good am I good and we done like the is that enough and you know that's his mentality he sees a very casual participant in this you know he said he's willing to go and do what he was told but he doesn't have any passion for he doesn't have any desire for he doesn't have the real heart of a conqueror there you know it so he takes to me he smacks him on the ground a few times and he thinks I must have done my part you know I must have must have doing a good job here and then till he looks at it Elijah's face and Allah she's very angry Elijah's very angry is furious with him because he gets angry and he said he could have steps he could have he should have rather kept striking the ground you know he should have he should have known he was told this is God's deliverance to him and yet he's content to make a little progress and stop you know if he'd really caught the revelation if he'd really caught you know what Elijah was telling him you know he should have taken those arrows and beat them till there was nothing left because you know you know he said you mean this this country of Syria that's been oppressing us and have been making us so miserable and making us so you know you know enslave and all of those things I have the opportunity to comment and these arrows represent my deliverance over them I'm just gonna bash them on the ground you know till my hand is bloody til the shafts are broke until you know the feathers are all falling out and then I'm going to turn to you and say is this all that's left of Syria and Elijah would have been thrilled and God would have been thrilled because it would have shown that inside of him he caught the revelation that that conquering is till that enemy is destroyed not until the enemies got a couple bruises not until the enemies you know oh we better give up now but until that enemy is completely destroyed you know if we take God's Word to heart today every service we sit here the ministry is putting the power of God's Word into your hands to smite the enemy you know just like Elijah did here I said this is what you need to go to have victory over the devil this is what you need to do to have victory over your own self this is what you need to do you know to to get yourself in that place where the devil doesn't know what to do with you you have everything you need to completely destroy Satan out of your life but so many times we just take a few small swipes you know so the preacher says you know you can have total deliverance just keep pray and just keep claiming that just everything so we claim it a couple times you know we claim our healing a couple times we claim deliverance a couple times and then we stop just like Josh did and we say yeah oh okay I guess that's probably good enough well did you get here deliver it yet no but you know I kind of stopped claiming it you know I you know I didn't work the first couple times you know it did didn't seem to have the effect that I thought or I tried it for a while but that's not that's not what God's telling us to do you know get a little victory you know and then subtle again into your routine God's telling us to keep pressing until that enemy is completely destroyed you know I myself I don't really enjoy combat sports but you know I've seen a few clips of MMA fights and maybe some of you brothers have as well but you know it's quite a brutal sports mix mulcher mixed martial arts and and you know the pictures and stuff that I've seen that you know sometimes there's blood spattered all over the canvas when they're done you know people aren't bleeding and being punched and kicked and all of these things sounds wonderful I know but you know really that principle of it is that the match only stops when someone surrenders or goes unconscious you know and and it sounds wonderful it sounds like a very very Christianly thing to discuss you probably haven't seen violence like that since the last time the coffee boys played basketball but but but we we know that you know it's you know the competition is intense and it's fierce and and you know all of these things but the only because the only way to be to win is to beat on your opponent until they give up or knock them unconscious once the winner the person that you know wants to win the most you know gets into a dominant position and an MMA fight they they start throwing punches and kicks and they keep going often on till the person is completely unconscious and the ref actually has to stop to fight you know it sounds brutal it it sounds horrible you know but they they don't pin their enemy to the ground and then give them a couple little slaps and stop and you know look at the replica can I stop now like this is good you know because they would be giving their enemy an opportunity to get back up to gain an advantage on them to you know to to turn the table so to speak but you know they don't just you know smack around the guy a little bit no they punch and they punch and they punch until he looks lifeless you know and really you know you're probably thinking like this is how did this get into church but you know it says vicious and brutal you know it's not the kind of thing that we think about in our Christian life where everybody's so nice and God bless you and pat you on the back but when it comes to the devil that's the kind of ruthlessness that we need that's the kind of ruthlessness that we need because God is telling us really it's kill or be killed in this situation because the devil is certainly not going to give you a couple little swipes and then say well I guess he learned his lesson today you know if we look we look at Jobe God gave him space and he took every bit of space that he could you know every opportunity he had and that's what he does to us too many times is that whatever space God will give him he will take it and so we have to set that same kind of approach to him we get the devil on the ropes we get the devil on the ground we have an opportunity to be beaten on that devil it better not just be like a whoa I think I see a little welt there we're gonna stop devil that's probably you probably learned your lesson today but no we want to keep pushing and pushing and pushing our advantage until there's nothing left of that devil we want to keep hitting him and hitting him anything and not just until you know we get tired not just until you know we think he's had enough but until the referee until the great referee says you know that's enough you've conquered that devil keep hitting him until he's completely shattered you know sometimes we do that we just strike a couple little blows but we have opportunity to drive his kingdom completely away from our life drive him completely out of our home you know not just get a little bit of space a little bit of breathing room but drive them completely from our lives we have examples of godly men who would not settle you know one of those men we talked about last night and and I had in my notes again to read this some of you weren't here last night so let's just read this again but Paul is such an incredible example to me because he fought through so many things and yet he had just as much passion to keep doing it again you know we think about how many times we would still be willing to get up off the mat so to speak how many times we'd be willing to give it another shot but he just he just kept going and going and going as I mentioned last night I didn't read this scripture last night but you know when when God called Paul out of you know his false doctrine out of being a Pharisee and called him to walk in and to testify of Jesus Christ you know he didn't hide from Paul that it was he was gonna be challenging you know and had a nice gets sent to him and Hananiah says lord I have heard well some reason that I didn't get to make my notes and a nice answer said Lord I've heard by many of this man how much evil he had done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and here we have authority from the chief priests to bind all the call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my sake you know Paul was going into a situation none of us would sign up for brother Gerald and I were talking a little bit at breakfast this morning we think of you know the great victories and and things that brother branham did or we think of you know many of the people and all their testimonies and we think that oh man to have testimonies like that to have visions like that to have you know all these supernatural things must have been so wonderful and then you realize the suffering and the difficulty in the battles that it took to produce those things and suddenly our excitement about walking in their shoes tends to taper off a little bit but we read this again tonight second create the in chapter 11 Paul's talking about his own life he says are they ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more in Labor's moribund and stripes above measure in prisons more often in deaths oft both of us one death would be good enough but Paul had several deaths we know stoned to death raised back up to go and do it again you know of the Jews five times I received I forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice a chef suffered shipwreck a night in a day I've been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of water in perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without dye which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and I am NOT weak who is offended and I burned not he went through all of that and yet this is his testimony not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but Paul you've you've got a Hall of Fame list of legacy that you left behind you've you've got so many things surely God would let you in the kingdom surely you know you've done enough surely if you've you've got you know a long list of accomplishments here you could if there's anybody that can rest on those it's you Paul and he says not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I am also also am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but Paul you look at all these things you did Paul but acting out not myself too about behavior but this one thing I do forgetting the old Paul no we want to remember those things we went up lift them we want to want to celebrate them not forgetting those things that are in the past which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling God in Christ Jesus they said if there's anybody that should have been able to say oh we're just gonna sit back and wait till Jesus comes it was him and yet he says I don't count any of those things I don't count any of those things you know and I think of brother Browns life you know 50 years old he's laying in bed one morning thinking if I'm ever gonna do something for the Lord I'd better start now and you think what look at all the things that brother Browns done already if I'm ever gonna do something for the Lord I better start now what is that that's the heart of a conqueror who realizes it doesn't matter what the past victories are it only matters what the next challenge is it only matters how much further we can take it huh how much higher we can reach and so you know Paul is conquered again and again and again and again he never settled and it's not because Paul's a great man it was because Paul had the Holy Ghost and so when Paul looked at the sum of all of these things he said I didn't do all of this God did this it was God's grace that brought me through every step of the way it's God's grace that's led me to this place and so it's not because I think that it's good enough it's because I know that he still has a work to be done he still has a higher height to reach he has a deeper depth to go and so because of that and so Paul says the next verse he says let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded be less might have what minded just like he said I press toward the mark and if in anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you and I love that that he says that you know he doesn't say if any of you have a different mind then you know too bad about you I guess it's not for you but he says that if anyone else has otherwise minded God shall reveal even this to you you know maybe we've come to a place a lot of years down the road a lot of water under the bridge a lot of miles that we've traveled and we say oh you know now we're just waiting for the rapture you know now we're just sitting back and one day it's gonna take place and it's gonna be glorious well Paul's telling you that God wants to reveal to you it's not as though you've already apprehended it's not as though we've already reached the goal and now we're just sitting back twiddling our thumbs waiting waiting for the train to pull into the station but there's still more for us to conquer there's still more witness to be shared there's still more more souls to be prayed for there's still more things that we need to keep pressing into and it doesn't come and just fall in our lap we've got to go out and fight for it we've got to go out and battle for it if we think that the devil's gonna have compassion on us because we're a little older than we used to be who were a little more tired than we used to be no he doesn't have any more compassion you know he's got more armies lined up than ever before brother Bram talks about dueling with swords and he says in in the breach he said the swords he's talking about two men that are fighting with swords and they're both strong and they're both capable he said the swords if they lock the enemy and you lock swords like this and you've crossed your swords he said then it takes the strength of the man dueling because his sword we pointed to my heart and might any and mine to his but they're locked as our knives striking each other and they strike and his swords come together and the one can shove the other one down the sword straight to the heart so it takes even though the sword be the word it takes the hand of strong faith to hold it there to bring it to the heart of the enemy brother branham was given the Kings sword he talks about that just before the quote today the part that I read but the sword of God's Word is not just in brother Brown's hand it's in the hand of the bride today that same King sword is in our hand today from Almighty God that word of God you know didn't leave one brother Bram left and suddenly when the church has no strength but no we have great strength but it's gonna take a hand of faith that's willing to hold it to the heart of the enemy who's willing to keep it crossed up there with that enemy until God gives us the strength to press it all the way to his heart because that's the position or head that's the battle that we're in you know and it's too late to get distracted it's too late to get you know to get tired and just say oh you know well yeah I guess we've come far enough no we got to keep that sword in place do we have the strong head of faith to bring it to the heart of the enemy or do we say well who is a good fight thanks devil can we make a kind of here now you know we've both given it our best you know how about we just you know we'll just agree to disagree here and we just form some kind of a treaty no we need to keep pressing we need to keep pressing last scripture is part of the what we read you know he says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword and then he says as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter that sounds negative it sounds like the devil is just gonna beat you up and and kill you and you can't do anything about it and that's why he says nay he said nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us we're not accounted just as sheep for the slaughter we're not just there for the devil to beat on us that you know go into the kingdom as martyrs that you know they sacrificed their lives but the Bride of Christ is called to be more than a conqueror no more than a conqueror through him that loved us it's not our strength that we're depending on to put the sword to the enemy's heart you know we know the only one strong enough is our Lord Jesus Christ but we're the ones holding the sword he gave us the strength he gave us the word and everything else but he put the sword in your hand believing and knowing that you can push it into the heart of the enemy how is the bride more than a conqueror because it says that you are more than a conqueror well how is she more than a conqueror because every conqueror that's ever lived has died you know look at every gate great Conqueror Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan or Napoleon or whoever that went out they had a beginning of their conquering and they had an end where they died some of them died in humiliation some of them died by disease some of diet in interesting circumstances but there's one that will not die this bride is a conqueror that will never die she's going into a place where she's gonna have an eternal reign you know an eternal victory because every great woman and great man has died but this bride is gonna go into eternal life she is more than a conqueror she's more than a conqueror of the Dead she's more than a conqueror of death she's going to be one that reigns an eternal Kingdom an eternal king the first and a thousand-year millennium and then in a new Jerusalem for eternity so the question Conqueror or settler which one are you going to be which one are you going to be you have a choice we always have a choice you know we always have a choice to take the medicine or not take the medicine you know to be better off or or to be worse off and and brother Brown told us that that you never come to church and leave Church the same way he came in you know you might come in and you think oh you know well I'll just be the same person whether I choose to believe it or not but worried they're closer or further when we walk out you know and I trust the night that we're a little closer because we realize yeah okay I'm gonna keep fighting I'm gonna keep pressing you know it's not over yet yeah you know I might be a little bit late in the game I might have you know been a little slow to to jump and take my position but there's still time and there's still place and God is still cheering us on from the Bannister's of heaven saying keep going keep going and in our heart there's a there's an echo of a spirit that just says keep going keep pressing you know don't worry about the situation that don't that doesn't look good don't worry that you're lost loved ones not gonna be time for them just keep pressing just keep fighting that devil and let God's victory take place you know it might not be the way we think you know I have an expectation for my own life my own health man I sure like it to be a certain way but whatever the battle goes we're just gonna keep pressing one way or the other we're gonna be press in one way or the other and whatever it takes now no matter how long we're more than conquerors because he told us that's what he put inside of us you may not stand today we've been given arrows of deliverance we've been given a mighty sword and by God's grace we've been given the power to use those things lord help us to take them and to be mighty in Victoria don't point them at your brothers and sister you know no sword fight with your brothers and sisters put that sword to the heart of the enemy let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father a simple thought Lord and I I know that it takes your spirit to deal in our hearts Lord and to tell us where we've been settling where we've been relaxed where we've been complacent and so we could see the opportunity that we have Lord to to change those things father to to tighten up our lives though to get more enthusiasm lower to get a more zeal and to comment and take the word that we hear Lord and let it encourage us to go in and fight a little harder to win deliverance in our lives to win deliverance in our homes law to to focus on what really matters I pray Lord that you would just bless the people here abundantly with a stronger and a greater passion to to keep fighting lower this world that they live in this province of Newfoundland Lord maybe they've talked to many people they've witnessed and done those things but Lord you said that you put us as a city on a hill not that one that cannot be hid and that you want that witness and that testimony to go out from us every day you don't want us to to hide it you don't want us to to try to put the light aside but you want us to shine forth and Lord to be a witness in a world that continues to grow darker and and more saturated by sin but we want to stand for you Lord and we want to keep pressing as though we've not accomplished anything we're fresh on the battle battle field tonight load and we just ask lead us into battle Lord lead us and we might go and have victory for your kingdom father once you bless each one here with a greater abundance of yourself and Lord may we be able to just continue to keep pressing and fighting each step of the way in Jesus name do you guys sing if you're in the battle for the Lord and right keep on the firing

feel all excited you're ready to go all where's that devil at but when trouble comes knocking at the door and you're not ready you didn't invite trouble over and trouble comes knocking at a door we start to get a little nervous sometimes but don't give in you know it's not like before it's not like last time and the mistake you made here and the you know place you fell down you know the second verse says so hold on you're getting stronger every day and there's no reason for you to go astray don't be leaning on your understanding lean on him and we'll all say we've been made more than conquerors I've seen that one more time as bill Jill comes we've been made more [Music] where [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise the name of the Lord Amen not to keep you standing too long and to continue on with the service but the temptation is there so will yield not to temptation had the grace of God a man but yeah we always just to welcome our brother Phillip and sister Susan it's been a while since we we've seen them god bless you amen and dag and and all the rest of course and our we've our brother Karsan sister Sharon's been absent from us for a while and so the Lord blessed bless us all and draw us together as one body of Christ by the grace of God but again concerning the word and the message tonight it was the Lord amen reminding us again concerning God's plan and God's purpose and God's pattern amen when it comes to God's plan purpose and pattern in the creation of the heavens the earth and the creation of man and so also there was a plan there's a purpose and there's a pattern so I pray God that help us through the word tonight Elvis to recognize God's pattern more than we had before that our God deals with you and how God deals with me amen and our brother brought it out and the and in fact there was some note that I had written here in my Bible that our brother our brother brought it out in in his prayer and it was it was concerning the Elijah and joash and so on and I would like to have fallen sick and and told him to do this and told him to do that he did you know when it comes to anything that just was just one thing to do you know and they opened the window open do they let's do that throw the arrow out and that was fine he did it but when it comes to smiting the need neither the floor smite the ground well that that would take a take what I had written here and our brother had brought it out there was the Lord in our brother brought it out in prayer and it would take what it would take zeal and enthusiasm a man and not his knowledge the old me of the window or the the firing of the arrows that way was a very basic thing that fir for him to do but when it comes to smiting the ground that was then it's going to take a little bit more energy a little bit more zeal little bit more enthusiasm more revelation in his heart he had to really come out of the heart not out of the mind you know putting the senses into anything into an action by opening a window or for firing the arrows no no but when it comes to smoke eating that takes something and I tell you brother God and God is God's working on us that way and I pray that we have the zeal and the the enthusiasm and the desperation by the grace of God now we're going to who are going to smite the devil amen and what do you mean smite the devil through the senses of our flesh because remember God's working in the soul by faith and the devil is working in our flash through its senses and amen that's the matter where we're eating to constantly day in and day out and it is the faith of God coming out of the soul into your spirit and fighting the senses of your flesh because Satan is working on that because remember that your body is not born again your soul is born again but hide your body amen that's still in sin and Satan is working on it but but I pray the grace of God that the power from within the new creature in Christ Jesus rises up in your spirit a man through then through your spirit it's God controlling the senses of your flesh bringing it subject to the word amen and we've got to have that zeal and that enthusiasm that desperation by the grace of God to yield to him and follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost so that's tremendous and our brother was bringing out again about judges brother again we need to be mourn it's the word it's not over yet we're in the battle and we're still pressing on by the grace of God we've still got a battle of faith because when Joshua led them into the Promised Land the Bible speaks of the incomplete victory of Judah and unless Anna speaks of the incomplete victory of Benjamin the incomplete victory of Manasseh and others in in going into the Promised Land and our brother brought it out because they were content you know just to be friends with thee with the others there oh I pray Lord he'll help us to get the revelation of what was preached tonight amen that we're not going to be content with this content with that oh well we're in the land now no no you're in the land but you've got to possess all of it and control all of it but they did they they didn't they were in the land they didn't possess at all and it didn't control it all and that's right that's why they win it went after their gods amen and begin to worship their gods a man and and he said right here if I could just bear with me a moment here in the book of Judges he say he our brother referenced it here and or he brought it he brought some of these things out and when it comes to yeah Samson Samson and Delilah and the prophet of God said Samson give his heart to a woman but he said he just give us strength to God Amen so brother we got to give our heart and our strength to God everything has got to be under God's control and because they have the incomplete victories that they had won even in the promised land there's what to take absolute control of it amen but they didn't do it because of incomplete victories it'll lead to confusion it led to a civil and a religious confusion amen it was civil confusion politically because there was there were Tribes of Israel there were the other nations pagan nations then we're there and they ran there and irrigated becoming friends with them brother you've got to be careful you could have a right spirit of right attitude but don't go too far with it don't get too involved with it amen when it comes to the world the things of the world don't you do that amen because it could be a trap of the devil amen - you know you're a Christian so so you gotta you got to do this you got to do that we got to take our stand for Jesus we got to remain separated onto the Lord and let's not get involved in the King in the civil and religious confusion of the world amen we are separated we are going into a Indian to rapture by the grace of God amen don't don't do it and again I ministered on eight years ago ten circles where they are ten circles that a shirt that's why that's what I live in a Levite or Levitical priest solace is convictions for and his absolute stand for God for amen and he when he was s what that's what this this Jew played him it's so that you could come and be part of my my house whole part of my religion but he was also a pagan the man was was serving other gods but he went got this Levite and he persuaded him to come and all you you represent Jehovah for me and the others here these idols they represent these gods trying to please the world and the please God and he paid this Levitical priest he paid him ten shekels and a shirt and so I have Anita day are going to sell them their faith absolute separation on the Lord to the Lord I'm going to separate sell it out for ten shekels and a shirt and we are going to sell it out for the world and the things of the world or the friendship of the world brother it is total separation as our brother brought out concerning Paul as tremendous not as so we've already attained are already perfect they are Souls we are in our flesh were not and the war continues till we walk till we step from time to eternity in a glorified body and we're battling fighting what this flesh wants so are we living for the flesh are we living for out of the soul is it the soul I trust by the grace of God we are living out of the convictions of our soul the new creature in Christ not what the flesh wants we're reaching out to bring the flesh subject to the soul a man and the leadership of God the Lord bless you the Lord bless our brother Brandon thank God for the word again tonight and I pray the Holy Ghost will be able to bring it to our remembrance amen when the enemy comes in to and attempt us God's going to bring to our remembrance well you heard preach tonight that said be on your guard be on your toes by the grace of God you guys remember you're not there yet but again God permitted that even there in Israel he said and the anger of the Lord was not a gate was hot against Israel because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not our cannot to my voice I will also not in short drive out any from them of the nations which Joshua left when he died that through them I may prove Israel and through what surround us with your jobs in your families your friends sometimes through these God is going to prove God is going to prove you whether you will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not God's going to see if we're going to stay faithful as the Lutheran's the early Lutheran's did the early methods there in Pentecostals and so on stay his faithful and press on by the grace of God into the resurrection and the rapture brother it's your life he gave his life we give ours to him praise the Lord hallelujah amen god bless you that's let's sing more abundantly and we return it to our brother Bob and be in prayer for our
