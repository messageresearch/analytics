[45:59] again certainly enjoyed our time
[46:02] together last time and and and we just
[46:05] trust the Lord will bless us again this
[46:06] morning we want to turn to the book of
[46:08] Hebrews chapter
[46:10] 11 Hebrews chapter
[46:14] 11 take a little different maybe a
[46:17] little different
[46:18] thought this morning certainly not un
[46:22] shouldn't be unfamiliar but I I trust
[46:25] that will will allow us to to get it out
[46:29] the way that it has come to us Hebrews
[46:33] 11 I want to begin to read from verse
[46:37] 32 very familiar passage of
[46:42] scripture and what shall I more say for
[46:44] the time would fail me to tell of Gideon
[46:48] and of baric and of Samson and of
[46:51] Jeff David also and Samuel and of the
[46:55] prophets who through faith subdued
[46:57] kingdoms wrought
[46:59] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[47:02] the mouths of lions quenched the
[47:05] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[47:07] sword out of weakness were made strong
[47:11] waxed Valiant in
[47:13] fight flight the armies of the aliens
[47:17] women received their dead raised to life
[47:19] again and others were tortured not
[47:21] accepting Deliverance that they might
[47:24] obtain a better Resurrection
[47:27] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[47:29] and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and
[47:32] imprisonment they were stoned and they
[47:34] were saw aund were tempted were slain
[47:37] with the sword they wandered about in
[47:40] sheep skin and goat skins being
[47:42] destitute Afflicted
[47:44] tormented of whom the world was not
[47:46] worthy they wandered in deserts and
[47:48] mountains and dens and caves of the
[47:50] earth and these all having obtained a
[47:54] good report through faith rece receive
[47:57] not the promise God having provided
[48:00] something better for us that they
[48:02] without us should not be made perfect
[48:06] may be
[48:10] seated these are this is a you know some
[48:15] of the Heroes of Faith we read about in
[48:17] Hebrews 11 and when we when we look at
[48:20] these characters and think about what
[48:22] they experienced and what they went
[48:24] through it's when we look at our own
[48:27] lives and we look at the troubles that
[48:29] we face and sometimes how successful we
[48:32] have or maybe how we have
[48:35] failed and we try to compare ourselves
[48:39] with these with these characters of
[48:41] scripture sometimes it's hard to do
[48:44] that it's hard to imagine that our
[48:47] testimony would would would come
[48:50] anywhere near the testimony of these and
[48:52] yet it says here the very last verse we
[48:54] read that they without us
[48:57] that they without us wouldn't be
[49:01] perfect but yet when we look at
[49:03] ourselves it's very hard for us to see
[49:06] ourselves and to compare ourselves
[49:08] sometimes with these ones that
[49:10] accomplish such great things but we
[49:12] don't read you know about their life at
[49:15] home and the things that they go through
[49:17] some of them we we get some insight but
[49:19] some of these we don't really we don't
[49:21] see it and so we think that maybe they
[49:23] were just on the top of the world all
[49:25] the time they were conquering every day
[49:27] but but they were just human like us too
[49:30] and they went through things and they
[49:32] they had their ups and their downs they
[49:34] had their good days and their and their
[49:35] bad days and it wasn't always easy and
[49:38] we see that not every not every victory
[49:41] was miraculous we we read in the first
[49:44] part about the great things that took
[49:46] place you know Daniel and the lion stand
[49:48] the three Hebrew children we know all
[49:50] those great Miracles but then we see the
[49:52] other side of people whose Faith was
[49:55] tested in a different way and their
[49:57] faith you know ended up being that they
[49:59] had to give their life they had to be
[50:01] tortured and their testimony is just as
[50:03] powerful as the one with the victory I
[50:06] think about brother Daryl Ward he's a
[50:07] good friend of mine and you know he's
[50:09] got that great testimony of his daughter
[50:11] being healed and it's a miraculous thing
[50:14] but I know another Minister friend that
[50:16] had a a son who was killed in an
[50:19] accident and didn't have that testimony
[50:21] but but his testimony is different that
[50:23] in the in spite of that trial he stands
[50:27] with great faith and still to this day
[50:30] loves the Lord and is a great
[50:32] inspiration and so they both have
[50:34] amazing amazing testimony very different
[50:36] outcome in terms of what what it was
[50:39] like you know in this life and so we're
[50:41] all called to go through things we all
[50:44] have a different walk and we wonder why
[50:46] sometimes that we're called to go a
[50:48] certain way but God has a
[50:51] purpose my thought this morning is it
[50:53] might seem counterintuitive because we
[50:56] we read so much about what God can do
[50:59] with us and and all of that's true and
[51:00] the power of God but but I want to take
[51:03] a thought this morning and it I would
[51:06] title it in search of
[51:09] weakness search of weakness that's again
[51:12] it might seem like an odd thing but I
[51:13] trust as we get along we're not
[51:16] suggesting you know that God is designed
[51:19] you know for us to just go through life
[51:21] powerless but I want to show you we we
[51:24] when if you read that scripture if you
[51:25] noticed in the middle of of that passage
[51:27] we just read it said out of weakness
[51:30] were made
[51:32] strong these ones that succeeded and
[51:35] conquered and did all of these things
[51:37] they did it with weakness they were weak
[51:41] it's not it's and that's where we have
[51:43] to come to I want to start my message
[51:45] off with a quote from Humble thyself
[51:48] brother brandom said you know people
[51:49] want power and they don't really know
[51:51] what power is he said the Way Up Is Down
[51:57] always the Way Up Is Down always well
[52:01] that says a lot to me that says that if
[52:03] we aspire to to have the power of God
[52:06] manifested and we know brother brandom
[52:08] taught us that we are God's hands and we
[52:10] are God's mouthpiece we are his eyes and
[52:12] ears and so we we think about that way
[52:15] but sometimes we think that we have to
[52:17] build ourselves to some condition where
[52:19] God can work with us but brother Bram
[52:22] said the way I'm starting this I have
[52:23] more that brother Bram says here but he
[52:25] said the way up is down always always so
[52:30] it's never about building ourselves up
[52:32] it's always about being humble he said
[52:34] if you want Power see how humble that
[52:37] you can get and I can tell you just even
[52:40] in my own little Ministry that the times
[52:43] that God has accomplished the most with
[52:46] me is when I have felt the most
[52:49] insufficient when you sometimes get to
[52:51] where you feel like oh the Lord's really
[52:53] given me something and you if you ever
[52:55] get caught in that and once in a while
[52:57] you I can get caught in that and and
[52:59] then you find that it just doesn't have
[53:01] the same effect but when you can go and
[53:04] be humble about it and feel like I don't
[53:06] know how this is going to go if it's
[53:09] going to work and then you see God step
[53:11] in and do something pretty miraculous
[53:13] it's all about being humble brother
[53:15] brand said if you want Power see how
[53:17] humble you can get get away from your
[53:18] worldly thinking humble yourself before
[53:21] God and then he said you've got more
[53:23] power then he said the man that runs all
[53:25] over the building and makes a big lot of
[53:28] noise CU we hear those and I I don't
[53:30] have anything against that I really
[53:32] appreciate those Ministries too but
[53:35] there's sometimes that's all it is my
[53:37] father used to say you know when you you
[53:39] pray for someone sometimes people get
[53:41] really excited and that's good if that
[53:43] helps stir their faith but the devil
[53:45] doesn't really care how loud you holler
[53:48] he's not afraid of you he's afraid of
[53:51] the god that you serve otherwise you end
[53:54] up like the sons of ska you challenge
[53:55] the enemy and you find you don't have
[53:57] the goods to back it up then you're not
[53:59] going to
[54:00] conquer but if we can be humble and just
[54:02] recognize it's God in us brother
[54:05] brandham said you do you do better than
[54:07] the the the one that runs all over the
[54:09] building makes a lot of noise because
[54:10] you've been able to conquer yourself and
[54:12] commit yourself to Christ and humble
[54:15] yourself before him he said that's real
[54:19] power you know it's not about our
[54:24] ability or some super human faith
[54:27] brother Brown taught it and Jesus taught
[54:29] it too how that it is just simple if you
[54:32] had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you
[54:35] could say to this mountain be moved so
[54:38] it's not about that that aspect of it
[54:41] God can do a lot with just a
[54:44] little brother bradam says and and a
[54:47] number of the quotes that I'll I'll
[54:49] mention this morning comes from a
[54:50] message brother brandham preached called
[54:52] perfect strength by Perfect weakness he
[54:56] said try to make our weaknesses an
[54:59] excuse and you know this is nothing I'm
[55:01] saying today should be new to us but
[55:03] sometimes we can get caught in different
[55:05] trains of thought and we just kind of
[55:07] ignore some of these other things he
[55:10] said we try to make our weaknesses
[55:11] excuses we want to tell how big we are
[55:14] and how great we are and he said you
[55:16] know he said I believe that's why God
[55:17] gave me this text is to get that out of
[55:19] our minds because a lot of people when
[55:22] God does start blessing them they start
[55:24] to to rely more on on that and somehow
[55:27] they think like the scripture says you
[55:29] know that as if that was something that
[55:31] that they were putting into it when it
[55:33] was God all the time and they're
[55:35] starting to lean on their own ability he
[55:38] said the thing it's the little things we
[55:40] do brother randam said we come to church
[55:43] the reason we come to church is to find
[55:45] out where our faults are it doesn't mean
[55:46] that we want to stay in a weakened
[55:49] condition and of course we're all we're
[55:51] all born in sin to start with with
[55:53] failures and
[55:54] flaws that go with us and until we're
[55:58] converted but but understand this that
[56:00] when you're converted you know I I just
[56:02] read a quote I think it was just last
[56:03] week when you're converted you walk up
[56:06] here to the altar if you're a sinner
[56:07] today and you walked up here and you
[56:09] give your life to the Lord and let's say
[56:12] you got a maybe a suit on and you're
[56:14] you're dressed a certain way and you got
[56:17] a certain eye color and hair color and
[56:19] all of that you know when you walk up
[56:20] the door after God has saved you you
[56:23] don't look any different brother bam
[56:24] said your friends will meet you in the
[56:25] street and say you don't look any
[56:27] different than you did before it's
[56:29] because that's not where the change
[56:31] takes place change takes place on the
[56:33] inside now if you're if you come in and
[56:35] you're a man and you're dressed like a
[56:36] hippie and sloppy and all of that
[56:38] there's going to be a a change that
[56:40] people will see on the outside but it's
[56:42] a change that you that you do you go get
[56:44] cleaned up you go get your haircut and
[56:45] things like that you do that but the
[56:47] change that God does happens on the
[56:50] inside and then when we're changed you
[56:52] know we're still stuck with this flesh
[56:55] which is our biggest enemy me and it
[56:57] still has Hang-Ups and flaws and
[56:59] weaknesses in it that carry through the
[57:02] most that we are able to do with this
[57:04] flesh is to put it under subjection but
[57:07] it's it's still corruptible there's
[57:09] nothing Eternal about these this flesh
[57:11] it's corruptible it's going to Decay one
[57:13] day it's going to die but we have a body
[57:15] the Bible says waiting us it's
[57:17] Incorruptible but we still have to deal
[57:20] with this flesh and that and and those
[57:22] weaknesses that are there God allows
[57:24] them to be there for very vious reasons
[57:27] and and and and we we don't like them we
[57:29] wish they weren't there but but I
[57:31] believe in many ways God allows that to
[57:33] keep us humble to keep us to a place
[57:35] where we realize that we need that we
[57:38] need him so we come to church brother
[57:40] bradam said to find out where our faults
[57:41] are now when it comes to sin and things
[57:43] like that we certainly we don't want to
[57:45] tolerate that we want to overcome that
[57:47] we want God to to change that but there
[57:49] are things in our lives that we just
[57:52] continually have to deal with but he
[57:53] said we come to find out about our
[57:56] faults and things that we might better
[57:58] ourselves by that's why we come to
[58:00] church he said if we come for any other
[58:01] reason he said we're not going to get
[58:03] much out of coming to church he said we
[58:06] must come to find our weak find our bad
[58:08] places see how little we are to put our
[58:11] trust in somebody that's strong because
[58:13] there's always going to be things I
[58:15] don't care how far along you come in
[58:17] serving the lord there's always going to
[58:19] be things you're fighting with and
[58:20] you're dealing with in your life your
[58:23] personal life but also just around you
[58:25] there are things that are going to
[58:27] happen that you have to deal with
[58:28] decisions you have to make it's
[58:30] constantly there and that's where we
[58:33] have to rely on God he said the very
[58:36] thing that we make excuses by our
[58:38] weaknesses are the things that God uses
[58:40] to tackle the job with remember Moses
[58:43] you know he complained he couldn't speak
[58:45] well and different ones had different
[58:47] reasons in the Bible why they didn't
[58:48] think they could do things and sometimes
[58:50] we feel the same way you know why would
[58:53] you choose me to do this I don't feel
[58:54] like I can do it and of course we you
[58:58] know some of you folks here might be in
[58:59] in management I I've been a manager for
[59:01] a number of years and and and have hired
[59:04] people at different times and when we're
[59:05] in you know a lot of things do parallel
[59:08] well with how the way God thinks but
[59:10] this is a little different when we hire
[59:12] somebody when you hire somebody you know
[59:14] you're looking for the best qualified
[59:15] most of the time very rarely are you
[59:17] looking for someone less qualified but
[59:20] God's very different than that he
[59:22] prefers to call the people who are not
[59:24] really qualified because God prefers to
[59:28] qualify the cult he's not looking for
[59:31] you to come and say well I I'm I'm this
[59:33] like the Pharisee you know i' I've done
[59:35] all these things so I'm I'm in a good
[59:37] position to do more for God no he calls
[59:39] you in a condition where you can't do
[59:42] anything and then he gives you what you
[59:44] need he trains you however he wants to
[59:45] train you brother brandom said the the
[59:48] excuses that's what God uses to tackle
[59:50] the job with and in fact brother mam
[59:53] says this he said he waits for us he
[59:55] waits for us to get into that condition
[59:58] so he can use us waits for us to get
[1:00:01] into that condition where where we feel
[1:00:05] like we can't do the job so it's as I
[1:00:08] said it's counterintuitive to the way we
[1:00:09] think in the natural we want people that
[1:00:11] are confident and that are not afraid
[1:00:13] you know I have had people that afraid
[1:00:15] to make decisions you know on on the job
[1:00:17] you need people but God's not looking
[1:00:19] for that he's looking for the ones that
[1:00:20] don't know how to make a step forward
[1:00:22] because he wants them to trust in him to
[1:00:25] lead them to God guide them and direct
[1:00:26] them that way so it's a little different
[1:00:28] than the way that we think he said he
[1:00:30] chooses us because we're in that
[1:00:33] condition and he said we find out the
[1:00:35] people who are the weakest and the
[1:00:36] rejected by the outside world is God's
[1:00:40] Heroes they're the ones that God chooses
[1:00:43] and they'll conquer he said up in the
[1:00:45] front line he said the people who feel
[1:00:47] themselves unworthy it's not that they
[1:00:48] are unworthy but they feel that way they
[1:00:52] have something in them but it's
[1:00:53] something that God put there and it's
[1:00:55] the humbleness
[1:00:56] that they have in their heart that
[1:00:57] allows them to succeed some of the
[1:01:00] greatest ministers I know you know when
[1:01:02] you talk to them outside of their
[1:01:04] Ministry you would never imagine they
[1:01:06] would have that kind of anointing when
[1:01:09] they're behind the pulpit and that's how
[1:01:11] I am more convinced that they are men of
[1:01:13] God I've also heard ministers that seem
[1:01:16] anointed you talk to them after and they
[1:01:17] have a terrible Spirit an arrogant
[1:01:19] Spirit I'm thinking you're not going to
[1:01:21] get very far with your ministry if you
[1:01:23] have that you've got to be humble
[1:01:29] brother Bram said remember this and he's
[1:01:32] speaking about preachers and but but
[1:01:34] every one of us he said there's one
[1:01:36] thing and this always struck with me he
[1:01:38] said there's one thing that we have got
[1:01:40] to master if we expect to fulfill God's
[1:01:43] desire in our life and we're all here to
[1:01:47] fulfill something every person in this
[1:01:50] building has been called to fulfill
[1:01:53] something in God's plan you have a
[1:01:55] purpose purp you're not just here to
[1:01:57] occupy the Pew and just to sit here but
[1:01:59] you have something that God desires to
[1:02:02] he has a desire to express some
[1:02:04] attribute of himself in your life you
[1:02:06] might not be a minister maybe you're not
[1:02:08] an not a deacon or or whatever it is but
[1:02:11] you have something every person has
[1:02:13] something that God wants to express
[1:02:15] through your life but brother bam said
[1:02:18] we have to master something if we're
[1:02:20] going to fulfill God's desire in our
[1:02:22] life we have to master something and he
[1:02:24] said that thing we have to master Master
[1:02:26] is the thought of human
[1:02:28] ability the thought of human
[1:02:31] ability he said if we ever get to a spot
[1:02:34] that we think we can do it with our own
[1:02:36] intelligence our own abilities he said
[1:02:38] we have got to master that in such a way
[1:02:40] that we can get rid of that thing and
[1:02:42] lay it aside so God can use this it
[1:02:45] seems odd you know it seems odd well I
[1:02:47] have this ability why shouldn't I be
[1:02:48] using it but but we it's not the
[1:02:51] necessarily the ability notice brother
[1:02:53] Brad said it was the thought the thought
[1:02:55] that we have that of course God places
[1:02:58] things within us those that can play an
[1:03:00] instrument you know there's something
[1:03:01] within them and they probably sense that
[1:03:03] but as long as you have a thought that
[1:03:05] you can do something you're not going to
[1:03:07] succeed as far as God is concerned
[1:03:10] you've got to master the thought of
[1:03:12] human ability he said if we can do
[1:03:15] that he said we must make a complete
[1:03:19] surrender in fact he says this he said
[1:03:22] we cannot use one ability we cannot use
[1:03:25] one AB ility we've got to make a
[1:03:27] complete surrender and come to God
[1:03:29] surrender our soul our body our spirit
[1:03:31] everything that you are has to be
[1:03:33] surrendered to God in order that he can
[1:03:35] work his will in you and me now it
[1:03:38] doesn't mean that if you have something
[1:03:40] that God's placed within you that you
[1:03:42] feel well that's an ability that I'm
[1:03:43] just going to not use that no but you
[1:03:45] have to get rid of the idea that it's
[1:03:48] yours you got to get rid of the idea
[1:03:50] that it's your ability it's not your
[1:03:51] ability if you have anything that you
[1:03:53] can do it's because the grace of God has
[1:03:56] has put it in your life but as long as
[1:03:58] you think it's you and I have this and
[1:04:01] that's the problem and brother Brown
[1:04:02] mentions that I think I have a quote
[1:04:03] here about that he says you know
[1:04:05] sometimes we want to put something into
[1:04:06] it and so we we have a gift for
[1:04:08] something and we're going to try this or
[1:04:10] we're going to try that we got to forget
[1:04:11] about that and let God lead us and let
[1:04:14] God use us he said we can't use one one
[1:04:17] one ability we've got to surrender it he
[1:04:19] said everything that you are has to be
[1:04:21] surrendered to God he goes on he says he
[1:04:25] said that he said it's hard because we
[1:04:28] always want to put our part in right God
[1:04:31] blesses us and then we think oh maybe if
[1:04:33] I do this and maybe if I do that instead
[1:04:35] of saying God what would you have me do
[1:04:37] we we think we we get a little bit of
[1:04:40] progress in our in what we're doing and
[1:04:42] then we want to put something in we're
[1:04:44] always wanting to brother bradam said
[1:04:46] put our part in but he said no ability I
[1:04:49] don't care whose it is will ever be
[1:04:51] usable in the sight of God it's the
[1:04:53] approach brother Brown said God has to
[1:04:55] get all of our abilities out of us
[1:04:57] before he can achieve his
[1:05:01] purpose if he's got something for us to
[1:05:03] do he said as long as we feel we're
[1:05:06] doing pretty good that's the struggle
[1:05:08] because as soon as God does give you
[1:05:10] something and you start to feel that he
[1:05:11] said as long as we're feel we're doing
[1:05:13] pretty good job out of it he said we'll
[1:05:15] never be used of God well that's that's
[1:05:18] tough because we all are human and we
[1:05:20] like to feel that what we're doing is
[1:05:22] appreciated and so it's a constant
[1:05:24] battle brother said about ministers you
[1:05:26] know one of the three things they have
[1:05:28] to watch is popularity to to to that
[1:05:31] idea that oh I'm doing a pretty good job
[1:05:33] and so constantly as ministers we have
[1:05:36] to we have to put that down and
[1:05:37] recognize and and of course for a lot of
[1:05:40] us I know for me there's enough things
[1:05:42] that there's enough weaknesses in this
[1:05:43] whole flesh of M that it's not hard for
[1:05:45] me to realize it's only the grace of God
[1:05:49] if if I Minister and and God does
[1:05:51] something it's just the grace of God but
[1:05:53] for some people it's a lot of work you
[1:05:55] know they have a hard time to to be
[1:05:57] humble but for me it's not not been so
[1:06:00] much of an issue you know those I know
[1:06:02] my weaknesses and most of us can look in
[1:06:04] the mirror and see the flaws and if
[1:06:05] we're if we just constantly remind
[1:06:07] ourselves it's only the grace of God if
[1:06:10] he If He blesses what we do then we can
[1:06:12] keep ourselves in that place where God
[1:06:14] can use
[1:06:16] us brother Bram talked he was it was at
[1:06:19] the time he preached this message he
[1:06:20] said there was a great Gathering of of
[1:06:22] protestant and Catholic people about 100
[1:06:25] 50,000 something like that and he said
[1:06:27] they were praying some prayers or saying
[1:06:29] some prayers and they were all gathered
[1:06:30] together and they would have probably
[1:06:32] whatever it was at the time and he
[1:06:34] didn't say why they were gathered and
[1:06:35] praying but he said they you know they
[1:06:37] Pro they probably thought they were
[1:06:39] doing something great but brother
[1:06:41] brandham said they might as just well
[1:06:42] have not
[1:06:44] gathered he said it's not worth nothing
[1:06:46] in the sight of God you imagine those
[1:06:48] 150,000 people probably thought they
[1:06:49] were doing something pretty amazing
[1:06:51] gathering together and saying some
[1:06:53] prayers whatever it happened to be that
[1:06:55] it was but he said they me not even
[1:06:56] gathered it wasn't worth anything in the
[1:06:59] sight of God so even our Gatherings and
[1:07:01] there are churches that are people are
[1:07:03] meeting together all over the world
[1:07:04] today you know we have message churches
[1:07:07] but there's many non-denominational and
[1:07:08] other groups setting together I wonder
[1:07:10] how many of those Gatherings are serving
[1:07:13] basically no purpose as far as the
[1:07:15] kingdom of God is concerned how many
[1:07:17] people are gathering together today
[1:07:18] fulfilling what they feel is satisfying
[1:07:22] to God when it's kind of like Cain's
[1:07:24] offering he has no respect to it there's
[1:07:28] a lot of people that go to church you
[1:07:29] know every Sunday and and do these
[1:07:32] things that and I've met those people
[1:07:34] during Co I come to find out some of the
[1:07:36] people I worked with you know that they
[1:07:38] talked about oh I can't go to church and
[1:07:40] man I didn't know that they even went to
[1:07:42] church you would never know it because
[1:07:44] they didn't seem to me like they were
[1:07:46] Christian people but but they had this
[1:07:48] routine and they I guess to them they
[1:07:50] thought it meant something but you know
[1:07:52] there's going to be a lot of
[1:07:53] disappointed people one day when they
[1:07:55] realize that that's just not quite
[1:07:57] enough we we need to come to church
[1:07:59] certainly we do we need to gather
[1:08:01] together it's the right thing the Bible
[1:08:02] says assemble yourselves even more so as
[1:08:05] we see the day approaching but that's
[1:08:08] but it takes more than that takes more
[1:08:10] than
[1:08:12] that he said we've got to get away from
[1:08:14] that that that human ability and
[1:08:17] surrender our souls and our lives and
[1:08:20] brother Brown takes that not just to the
[1:08:22] the the spiritual leaders but brother
[1:08:24] Brown said even to the housewife to the
[1:08:26] farmer to the mechanic he said whoever
[1:08:29] we are we've got to surrender completely
[1:08:31] to God and know that we are nothing know
[1:08:35] that we are nothing and then he said let
[1:08:37] God start from there and he'll start
[1:08:39] moving and working he said that's
[1:08:41] includes every one of us all of us now
[1:08:44] some of us as I said don't have that
[1:08:45] much trouble with that we many are
[1:08:48] struggling just with living in life and
[1:08:50] we go through so many trials and tests
[1:08:52] so some of us maybe don't have that
[1:08:54] issue we may may maybe we have that the
[1:08:56] problem on the other side where we feel
[1:08:58] so inadequate that we don't even try to
[1:09:00] do anything for God and that's a problem
[1:09:03] too I want to go to the Book of Judges
[1:09:05] for a moment and look at at a situation
[1:09:09] there and a man by the name of Gideon
[1:09:11] you're familiar with his
[1:09:13] story but you know the Israel had sinned
[1:09:16] and we know that God dealt with Israel
[1:09:19] pretty much exclusively as a nation and
[1:09:21] so when they sinned usually they were
[1:09:23] all punished if one man you know it's
[1:09:25] kind of like the New Testament one man
[1:09:27] suffers everything and one member
[1:09:28] suffers they all suffer and that's kind
[1:09:30] of what happened and the midianites were
[1:09:32] oppressing them there and judges 6 but
[1:09:35] then they they begin to cry out to the
[1:09:37] Lord after a certain point and God
[1:09:39] begins to respond to them and sends the
[1:09:42] angel of the Lord along and it happens
[1:09:44] and we'll pick it up around around the
[1:09:47] uh let's pick it up at the 12th verse
[1:09:50] the angel of the Lord positions himself
[1:09:52] so he's where the man Gideon
[1:09:55] is
[1:09:56] threshing by the wine press in fact
[1:09:59] verse 11 it says Gideon is threshing
[1:10:02] Wheat by the wine press to hide it from
[1:10:05] the midianites so if we if we take this
[1:10:07] scene and we jump at this point in time
[1:10:10] if you were looking at this and if you
[1:10:13] were trying to assess how do you think
[1:10:15] Gideon felt about himself do you think
[1:10:18] VI Gideon felt like a mighty conqueror
[1:10:22] do you think Gideon felt like a man that
[1:10:25] that had had everything within his
[1:10:26] control we see him here hiding his work
[1:10:30] from the
[1:10:31] midianites you know how many of us
[1:10:34] sometimes get into situations where we
[1:10:35] feel oppressed by the enemy we don't
[1:10:38] feel Victorious we feel like we're just
[1:10:40] doing well to get by and all of a sudden
[1:10:44] this Angel of the Lord is there in verse
[1:10:45] 12 and he speaks to Gideon and makes
[1:10:48] this statement if you can just think
[1:10:50] about how Gideon was thinking and how he
[1:10:52] was feeling and here is the Angel of the
[1:10:55] Lord making a statement in verse 12 and
[1:10:57] says to him the Lord is with thee thou
[1:11:00] Mighty Man of
[1:11:03] Valor now how do you think Gideon if and
[1:11:06] I I can identify I've been in situations
[1:11:09] when I felt like Gideon where the enemy
[1:11:11] just kind of throwing everything at me
[1:11:13] and and I see it looks like his victory
[1:11:16] I don't see a lot of God's victories
[1:11:18] going on and and all of a sudden if I
[1:11:21] was in that situation and here comes the
[1:11:23] angel of the Lord saying the Lord is
[1:11:25] with thee the AL Mighty Man of Valor and
[1:11:27] Valor there you know another way to say
[1:11:29] that is it's essentially someone with
[1:11:31] Fearless
[1:11:32] courage well Gideon certainly did not
[1:11:35] feel that way but it says something
[1:11:38] without reading any further that God
[1:11:41] sees things in us that we do don't see
[1:11:45] ourselves he sees potential in us that
[1:11:47] we don't often see ourselves and he
[1:11:50] wanted to bring that out so he come
[1:11:51] there I believe God sent that angel of
[1:11:53] the Lord there to give give Gideon some
[1:11:56] courage to stand up against this enemy
[1:12:00] and of course Gideon's response is as we
[1:12:02] would expect in verse 13 oh my Lord if
[1:12:05] the Lord be with us then why is all this
[1:12:06] befallen us and I think me saying this
[1:12:09] to you and even to me if I was to say
[1:12:12] that to you that you are children of
[1:12:14] Valor that you are men and women of
[1:12:16] Valor you might be in a situation today
[1:12:18] where you would have a hard time to
[1:12:20] believe that but that's exactly the
[1:12:22] situation Gideon was in you know there
[1:12:25] was there wasn't a lot of Victory there
[1:12:26] was a lot of a lot of trouble he was in
[1:12:30] and yet that didn't change the tress of
[1:12:32] the statement that was made to him that
[1:12:34] he was a mighty man of Valor he just
[1:12:36] didn't know
[1:12:38] it he he hadn't couldn't quite grasp
[1:12:40] that that could be true and I say it's
[1:12:43] the same of us and you hear men you know
[1:12:45] preachers come and I'm taking the
[1:12:47] weakness route this way because of the
[1:12:49] what God has inspired me to say but
[1:12:51] others will come by and talk about what
[1:12:53] God can do you know if he can get one
[1:12:55] man in his power and you hear all of
[1:12:56] that but you say how can that be me same
[1:12:59] way it could be for Gideon God sees
[1:13:02] within you something that he wants to
[1:13:05] pull out of you and that is a faith and
[1:13:07] that is an action that he wants to do in
[1:13:09] your life to accomplish something for
[1:13:12] him you could have loved ones out there
[1:13:14] could be many different things but God
[1:13:16] can work through you the same as he was
[1:13:18] going to work through Gideon here now
[1:13:22] the victory wasn't there yet all the
[1:13:24] Gideon saw was this enemy surrounding
[1:13:27] them and it was a great enemy more than
[1:13:30] a match for Gideon and that's probably
[1:13:33] what he was looking at and he's thinking
[1:13:35] well you know how could this possibly be
[1:13:38] be that we could overcome this enemy you
[1:13:40] know why if God is with us why is all of
[1:13:43] this befallen us and where's all the
[1:13:45] Miracles it says our fathers told us of
[1:13:49] well the angel of the Lord begins to
[1:13:51] encourage him and he encourages him in
[1:13:53] different ways we won't read all this
[1:13:55] this passage right now but if you read
[1:13:57] it you'll see where he does that and
[1:13:59] finally Gideon is convinced he tells him
[1:14:02] and he goes and he gathers a bunch of
[1:14:04] men together thousands of them and then
[1:14:07] God says if you read through the next
[1:14:08] couple of chapters you know he says well
[1:14:11] that's too many and you would think
[1:14:13] Gideon's just doing what he feels is
[1:14:14] right because it's a huge host that he's
[1:14:16] going to come up against and God says
[1:14:18] well that's too many he said if we do it
[1:14:21] this way the children of Israel going to
[1:14:23] think that they accomplished it of Their
[1:14:25] Own Strength so what was he trying to do
[1:14:28] he he he actually caused Gideon to go
[1:14:30] through a couple of steps to reduce the
[1:14:32] Army down to 300 to put it into a
[1:14:35] condition where it would have seemed
[1:14:36] impossible why because God wanted to
[1:14:39] show that it wasn't their
[1:14:41] ability it was going to be in weakness
[1:14:44] it was going to be in something that
[1:14:46] would seem impossible that God wanted to
[1:14:48] express himself it's easy to believe God
[1:14:51] when when everything is going well it's
[1:14:53] easy to believe God when we feel that we
[1:14:56] have control that's why people were you
[1:14:58] know raising children and different
[1:14:59] things they feel well I've got control
[1:15:01] and they don't they don't really
[1:15:03] exercise their faith because they they
[1:15:05] have control but it's like the range
[1:15:07] breaking you know when you're riding the
[1:15:08] horse you know you I have faith when I'm
[1:15:11] holding on to the rains well you don't
[1:15:12] need faith when you're holding on to the
[1:15:13] rains if you can drive if you know what
[1:15:15] you're doing you don't need Faith but
[1:15:18] when the rains break or when the brakes
[1:15:20] fail in the car and you're going down a
[1:15:22] hill you know and you can't get stopped
[1:15:24] that's what you need faith and so it's
[1:15:27] that way in life too when we when we've
[1:15:30] reached situations where there's
[1:15:32] absolutely nothing that we can do to fix
[1:15:35] it we like to fix things you know we
[1:15:37] like to solve problems when they come we
[1:15:39] what can I do but sometimes there's
[1:15:42] nothing we can do but trust in God and
[1:15:46] so God puts us in situations where we
[1:15:48] have to trust him he'll do that in our
[1:15:50] lives and and that's where and that's
[1:15:54] that's the trial of our faith that's why
[1:15:56] we are put through these things but we
[1:15:59] have more within us we just don't
[1:16:02] realize how much potential is there
[1:16:05] sometimes in spite of our weakness God
[1:16:07] is able to do great
[1:16:10] things and God wants us in that
[1:16:12] condition to where we can trust him and
[1:16:14] so he if we won't come to it on our own
[1:16:17] he'll certainly bring situations along
[1:16:19] where we have no opport no other option
[1:16:21] but to trust God
[1:16:25] brother Bram said history proves that
[1:16:28] God always chooses nobody's to become as
[1:16:33] somebody's he always chooses nobodies
[1:16:35] now there's a couple of there's an
[1:16:37] exception we're going to talk about here
[1:16:38] but most of the time God has choosing
[1:16:41] the weak the nobodies to become as
[1:16:44] somebodies he says the thing of it is
[1:16:46] having nothing that you can depend on in
[1:16:48] your own self or anything that you can
[1:16:51] do just a complete total surrender of
[1:16:53] your weaknesses unto God
[1:16:56] that's what God wants us to do say here
[1:16:58] I am having nothing having no ability
[1:17:00] that you can trust in that's not that's
[1:17:03] not comfortable for us we we don't want
[1:17:05] to be in that situation we want to be
[1:17:07] built up to a place where we feel that
[1:17:09] we can do something but God's not
[1:17:11] interested in that God is wants us to be
[1:17:14] in this condition where we feel
[1:17:16] inadequate and then he empowers us to do
[1:17:18] what he wants us to do but even when he
[1:17:21] does that we we we must always recognize
[1:17:24] that it's God and abling us to do it
[1:17:25] it's not it's not that we're good it's
[1:17:27] not that we are great it's not that
[1:17:29] we've got some great inherent ability in
[1:17:31] ourselves it's just God working within
[1:17:35] us so he uses noodies to become as
[1:17:38] somebody takes those that have been the
[1:17:41] world brother Brown said has rejected
[1:17:42] the modern age is rejected that's the
[1:17:44] kind he picks to use consider he said
[1:17:46] the apostles like Peter the fisherman I
[1:17:50] was preaching in a foreign country a few
[1:17:52] years
[1:17:53] ago and the pastor is the only Pastor I
[1:17:57] know of who actually has a a doctor of
[1:18:00] divinity degree you know and and never
[1:18:03] thought when I was ministering this it
[1:18:05] was what was on my heart this
[1:18:06] thought he has great emphasis on
[1:18:09] education and he come to me after and he
[1:18:11] was he appreciated the message but he
[1:18:14] mentioned you know about what I'm saying
[1:18:16] about Peter he said you know Peter was
[1:18:18] an educated man I thought well that's
[1:18:20] not what brother brandom said and that's
[1:18:22] not what the scripture would suggest
[1:18:24] either
[1:18:25] and he explained himself and I kind of
[1:18:27] took what he said but brother Brown said
[1:18:29] Peter the fisherman not enough education
[1:18:31] to write his own name and another place
[1:18:34] brother Brown said he wouldn't recognize
[1:18:35] his name if it was if if somebody wrote
[1:18:37] it and he was looking at it he wouldn't
[1:18:39] have recognized it so so I you know I
[1:18:43] that I'm I'm fine to believe it just
[1:18:45] that way that it was like that John
[1:18:48] ignorant and unlearned those men brother
[1:18:50] BR said he bypassed the Nobles and the
[1:18:52] education that doesn't mean God doesn't
[1:18:53] use education
[1:18:56] it's more of a problem it's like the
[1:18:58] rich man you know it's easier to go rich
[1:19:00] man to go through an eye of an needle I
[1:19:01] think sometimes for the educated it's
[1:19:04] it's easier to be ignorant than it is
[1:19:06] because education certainly is designed
[1:19:09] especially nowadays to take you away
[1:19:11] from God and so you have to be very
[1:19:13] careful with
[1:19:14] it he said that he said it was these
[1:19:17] unlearned John the unlearn he bypassed
[1:19:19] the Nobles educated priests celebrities
[1:19:22] of them days and the scholars and the
[1:19:23] church members and he said he's got
[1:19:27] those people who thought they were
[1:19:28] somebody and pick the people who were
[1:19:30] nobody and use
[1:19:33] them but here's the thing to get to the
[1:19:36] what I might call the exception to the
[1:19:38] rule brother Brown said a somebody can
[1:19:41] become one of his people and Paul's a
[1:19:44] good example of that we want to talk
[1:19:45] about him in a few moments but he said
[1:19:47] if somebody can become one of his people
[1:19:49] and God can use them if they're ready to
[1:19:52] forget that there is somebody
[1:19:55] so that's the that's the part that we
[1:19:57] have to remember so those with education
[1:19:59] and we're we're living in a world where
[1:20:00] almost everyone's educated now when I
[1:20:02] grew up people would drop out of school
[1:20:04] and get a job and they'd work their
[1:20:05] whole life and in some form trades
[1:20:07] wherever it was without needing much
[1:20:09] education now you need University
[1:20:11] College to do just basic things and so
[1:20:14] we're we're being forced into that so we
[1:20:16] have a lot more of that going on well it
[1:20:18] doesn't mean you can't serve God but
[1:20:20] you've got to put all of that aside and
[1:20:23] and and not think that that
[1:20:25] is going to contribute in some way that
[1:20:27] that's what you're going to use well I'm
[1:20:29] educated so now I can do this for God no
[1:20:32] he said you have to forget that you're
[1:20:34] somebody forget whatever it is that
[1:20:35] you've accomplished in your life in in
[1:20:39] your secular life and your education he
[1:20:41] said if you're ready to forget that
[1:20:42] you're a somebody become a nobody God
[1:20:44] can use you and make a somebody out of
[1:20:46] you but he said you for you've got to
[1:20:48] forget you're so important he said some
[1:20:51] people as soon as they become Christians
[1:20:52] become arrogant and indifferent and so
[1:20:55] on he said they're going backwards
[1:20:57] instead of forwards he said thee more
[1:20:59] you can get out of yourself the more
[1:21:01] room you've got for the Holy Spirit to
[1:21:03] come
[1:21:04] in so we want to take the example of
[1:21:07] Paul because
[1:21:08] Paul was one we'll talk about Moses too
[1:21:12] we know Moses was educated and God took
[1:21:13] it out of him but with Paul he didn't
[1:21:15] take his education out of him Paul was
[1:21:17] very
[1:21:18] scholarly but notice Paul's approach so
[1:21:20] he's a good example for those of us who
[1:21:22] might feel well I I had I you know I'm
[1:21:25] smart and Whatever It Is Well Paul's a
[1:21:27] good example of how to approach serving
[1:21:30] God with that uh handicap I would like
[1:21:34] to say those of us think it's a strength
[1:21:36] but I think it's a handicap sometimes 1
[1:21:39] Corinthians chapter 2 beginning at the
[1:21:42] first verse Paul says
[1:21:44] this he said he said I Brethren when I
[1:21:47] come to you came not with Excellency of
[1:21:51] speech now Paul used his education at
[1:21:55] times he was a great orator he was able
[1:21:57] to speak he was brought before Kings and
[1:22:00] he would speak but when it come to the
[1:22:02] word of God and when it come to speaking
[1:22:04] to the people he said I didn't come to
[1:22:06] you with Excellency of speech or of
[1:22:08] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:22:10] of God for I determined not to know
[1:22:13] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[1:22:15] him crucified notice verse three and I
[1:22:18] don't believe what Paul's about to say
[1:22:20] here in verse three was an act I believe
[1:22:22] he was sincere he said I was with you
[1:22:25] in weakness in weakness in fear and in
[1:22:30] much trembling now Paul was probably
[1:22:31] more educated than almost anyone that he
[1:22:33] spoke to but yet he his approach he had
[1:22:37] got somehow in his life he had he was
[1:22:39] able to come down to a place he was
[1:22:42] humble enough to feel weak to actually
[1:22:46] be fearful and to be in much trembling
[1:22:49] recognizing no doubt how significant it
[1:22:53] was being in the role that he was called
[1:22:55] to as the first messenger maybe not
[1:22:58] fully understanding he was but we know
[1:23:00] he was and yet understanding that
[1:23:02] responsibility to speak the truth it's
[1:23:05] it's it's a fearful responsibility
[1:23:07] anyone who's called to be a minister you
[1:23:08] know you you getting up and just saying
[1:23:11] things you you've got to be sure it's so
[1:23:13] easy to take a scripture to take a quote
[1:23:16] and go off somewhere here and be saying
[1:23:18] something that's not right and so he he
[1:23:21] he always approached his speaking in
[1:23:23] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:23:26] trembling verse four and my speech and
[1:23:28] my preaching was not with enticing words
[1:23:31] of man's Wisdom and he had that he could
[1:23:34] have used that he could have leaned on
[1:23:36] that ability that he had but he put that
[1:23:40] aside he said I didn't come with that
[1:23:42] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:23:45] of power and why did he do it that way
[1:23:48] so that our faith would not stand in the
[1:23:50] wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:23:53] God Paul Paul was humble enough that he
[1:23:55] didn't want to draw people to and that's
[1:23:57] a tremendous thing because there's
[1:24:00] something about human beings that want
[1:24:01] people to like them want people to be
[1:24:03] drawn to them but Paul deliberately
[1:24:05] spoke in a way that would not draw
[1:24:08] attention to himself that would not draw
[1:24:09] people to him but to draw them to God
[1:24:13] that's a tremendous gift to have that
[1:24:14] considering how how how educated Paul
[1:24:18] was how he could have spoken a way that
[1:24:21] would have caused people to be impressed
[1:24:23] with him instead of being impressed with
[1:24:25] what he was saying about God so he had
[1:24:27] this gift of being able to Humble
[1:24:29] himself genuinely humble himself to be
[1:24:31] able to speak to them in such a way that
[1:24:33] they saw God when they looked at Paul
[1:24:36] they didn't see Paul the great Paul they
[1:24:38] saw
[1:24:40] god brother Bram said realize that
[1:24:42] you've got to become nothing back to
[1:24:44] this again not a know- it all not a
[1:24:47] great somebody but a nobody so we've got
[1:24:50] to always and here's the thing brother
[1:24:53] Brown said you've got to become dust
[1:24:56] you've got to get to a place that you
[1:24:58] know that you're nothing and notice this
[1:25:02] and don't never rise above it most of us
[1:25:06] reach that point at some point in our
[1:25:08] lives maybe multiple times but then when
[1:25:10] things get going well you know that's
[1:25:12] what happened to many characters in the
[1:25:14] Bible when they got blessed Hezekiah
[1:25:16] different ones that God blessed and all
[1:25:18] of a sudden they begin to think more of
[1:25:20] themselves but brother Bram said you
[1:25:22] need to get to a place that you know
[1:25:23] you're nothing and don't ever rise above
[1:25:26] it no matter how long you're here no
[1:25:28] matter how much God blesses you don't
[1:25:30] ever feel like you're somebody great
[1:25:32] don't ever feel like you're something
[1:25:33] everything that God does through you
[1:25:36] that blesses the people do it in a way
[1:25:39] that's why Jesus said don't let the left
[1:25:41] hand know what the right hand is doing
[1:25:42] don't be looking for attention don't be
[1:25:45] looking for for appreciation from men
[1:25:47] and that's hard to do because we're
[1:25:49] human beings we have that desire for to
[1:25:51] be
[1:25:52] appreciated but if if we're really
[1:25:54] children of God we want God to get the
[1:25:56] glory because it's him that enables us
[1:25:59] to do what we
[1:26:01] do well Paul you know Paul was aware and
[1:26:05] became aware certainly of how easily it
[1:26:08] could have been remember Paul was taken
[1:26:11] and God showed him things that he didn't
[1:26:14] show anybody else in his day and so he
[1:26:17] had great revelation of the
[1:26:20] scripture the Bible says and I want to
[1:26:22] go to 2 Corinthians chapter 12 you're
[1:26:25] familiar with
[1:26:27] this and begin to read Around the
[1:26:29] seventh
[1:26:31] verse Paul recognized the the risk of
[1:26:35] what could happen to him that that
[1:26:38] popularity side one of those risks that
[1:26:40] the prophet spoke of he makes a
[1:26:43] statement here in verse 7 2 Corinthians
[1:26:46] 12:
[1:26:47] 7 he says unless I should be exalted
[1:26:50] above measure through the abundance of
[1:26:53] Revelation
[1:26:54] and so he he had a concern that with all
[1:26:57] of this knowledge that somehow it could
[1:27:00] cause him to think more of himself than
[1:27:02] he should lest I should be exalted above
[1:27:05] measure there was given to
[1:27:08] me you know we we think about the
[1:27:10] blessings of God but this that Paul was
[1:27:14] given was also from God and it was one
[1:27:17] of the greatest things that God could
[1:27:19] have gave him and was a thorn in the
[1:27:22] flesh it was a gift
[1:27:24] sometimes we think about suffering and
[1:27:26] pain and sickness as a as something from
[1:27:28] the devil and of course the devil causes
[1:27:30] that but sometimes God allows certain
[1:27:32] things that aren't very
[1:27:34] nice and Paul recognized this particular
[1:27:37] thing as a as a gift he said it was
[1:27:40] given to me a thorn in the flesh and
[1:27:43] what was The Thorn In the Flesh
[1:27:46] scripture says it was the messenger of
[1:27:47] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[1:27:50] exalted above measure so he knew he
[1:27:52] recognized it
[1:27:55] now he recognized it at this point that
[1:27:57] he's writing about it but when it first
[1:27:59] came upon him we know that he wanted it
[1:28:01] to be he wanted it to to to go away
[1:28:05] because he says in verse 8 for this
[1:28:07] thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it
[1:28:08] might depart from
[1:28:10] me and it wasn't until Jesus responds
[1:28:14] and tells him well in verse 9 he said my
[1:28:16] grace is sufficient my grace is enough
[1:28:20] my grace is enough for you and then he
[1:28:22] tells him why the thorn is there my
[1:28:25] strength because the thorn made Paul
[1:28:27] weak The Thorn In the Flesh which we're
[1:28:29] going to talk about in a moment kept
[1:28:32] Paul in a weakened
[1:28:34] condition and so he said Jesus said to
[1:28:38] him he spoke to him he said my strength
[1:28:40] is made perfect in weakness and it could
[1:28:44] have said your weakness because that's
[1:28:45] really what he was talking about my
[1:28:47] strength is made perfect in
[1:28:49] weakness all of a sudden Paul's eyes are
[1:28:51] open now he understands why he has this
[1:28:54] Thorn In the Flesh that's a tremendous
[1:28:58] thing and most of us would not welcome
[1:28:59] something like that Paul needed it and
[1:29:03] you and I need to some extent we're
[1:29:05] going to read a few things about what
[1:29:06] Paul experienced but and we may never
[1:29:09] experience it like that but but in our
[1:29:11] own way in God's way he has in our lives
[1:29:14] things that he allows to keep us
[1:29:17] humble for the same reasons you know
[1:29:21] that that that we might find ourselves
[1:29:23] thinking more more of ourselves and so
[1:29:25] God works through us but then he keeps
[1:29:27] us humble at the same time in whatever
[1:29:30] manner is needed and in the case of Paul
[1:29:32] it was this Thorn In the Flesh my grace
[1:29:34] is sufficient my strength is made
[1:29:36] perfect in weakness after he got that
[1:29:38] revelation of all the things that he got
[1:29:40] the revelation of understanding that
[1:29:43] this Thorn In the Flesh was a gift from
[1:29:46] God to keep him in the condition that
[1:29:48] God desired so that he could continue to
[1:29:51] do the work of God he makes this
[1:29:53] conclusion more most gladly therefore
[1:29:56] hard thing to come to but it's something
[1:29:58] we need to he said most gladly therefore
[1:30:01] will I rather glory in my
[1:30:04] infirmities we like to Glory when God
[1:30:06] does some good things for us but Paul
[1:30:09] recognized his infirmities was for him
[1:30:13] one of the best gifts that God could
[1:30:15] have gave him he said I will rather
[1:30:17] glory in my infirmities why because then
[1:30:19] the power of God might rest upon me Paul
[1:30:22] knew that if I if he did didn't have
[1:30:24] that to Humble him he would get exalted
[1:30:27] and then God would have to cast him
[1:30:28] aside there's a quote brother Brandon
[1:30:30] mentions since I don't have the
[1:30:32] reference right now but brother bam said
[1:30:34] there's many a good
[1:30:36] Minister because of popularity and women
[1:30:39] and money those things that get to
[1:30:40] Ministry he said there's many a good
[1:30:42] Minister that God has had to lay on the
[1:30:45] Shelf because of of failing in one of
[1:30:48] those things and so as gifted as Paul
[1:30:51] was if he had have been allowed to P
[1:30:54] that roote and get exalted above measure
[1:30:56] God would have had to lay him on the
[1:30:57] Shelf too but God desired to express
[1:31:01] himself and so was it was one of the
[1:31:03] best gifts that God could have given
[1:31:04] Paul was this Thorn In the Flesh to keep
[1:31:06] him humble why so that God could
[1:31:09] continue to work through Paul to
[1:31:11] accomplish his
[1:31:14] purpose Paul's Thorn In the Flesh now
[1:31:16] there people different people think
[1:31:17] different things brother Bram said it
[1:31:19] was no more a disease than anything else
[1:31:24] he said if it wasn't healing he got well
[1:31:27] notice what the scripture says and we
[1:31:28] read it the Bible says it was the
[1:31:31] messenger of Satan to Buffet me that's
[1:31:34] what it says some people thought it was
[1:31:35] his blindness and different things but
[1:31:37] the scripture says it was the messenger
[1:31:39] of Satan to Buffet me and what does the
[1:31:42] word Buffet mean brother bam says it
[1:31:44] means blow after
[1:31:46] blow so he didn't have just a continuous
[1:31:49] problem maybe for you or me it might be
[1:31:51] just something we deal with all the time
[1:31:53] but with Paul
[1:31:55] he would get a blow after blow brother
[1:31:57] brandham said he would heal him and he
[1:32:00] would get well he would heal him again
[1:32:03] then he would get sick he would heal him
[1:32:05] he got sick blow after blow but it
[1:32:08] wasn't just sickness there were many
[1:32:09] things that Paul went
[1:32:10] through he said the messenger of Satan
[1:32:13] not an infirmity as he meant as people
[1:32:15] he said try to
[1:32:18] interpret well just as Paul had these
[1:32:20] things we have them too and in fact the
[1:32:22] prophet says and we wonder sometimes
[1:32:24] well I'm a Christian I'm doing my best
[1:32:26] why am I experiencing these things it's
[1:32:28] because you are because you are a son or
[1:32:31] a daughter of God that you do experience
[1:32:33] these kinds of Trials brother Brandon
[1:32:35] makes a statement and these are not
[1:32:37] popular quotes I you know I I know I
[1:32:39] noticed that the people are not jumping
[1:32:41] in their seats and hollering amen over
[1:32:43] this but it's the truth
[1:32:45] anyways this quote won't won't excite
[1:32:48] you either but it's still true brother
[1:32:49] bradam said Satan will punch at you
[1:32:52] constantly constantly punching you until
[1:32:55] you're finished here on
[1:32:57] Earth constantly you know brother car's
[1:33:00] 94 years old it be 95 in February and he
[1:33:03] just lost his wife two years ago and he
[1:33:05] will tell you that that was the greatest
[1:33:06] trial he's ever gone through and here he
[1:33:08] served the Lord for 50 some years more
[1:33:10] than some people have been alive
[1:33:11] preaching the gospel and here he goes
[1:33:14] through what he says is probably his
[1:33:16] greatest trial he ever experienced just
[1:33:17] a couple years ago so we're never going
[1:33:20] to be free of this until we get to the
[1:33:23] other side so don't ever get to the
[1:33:25] place where we feel like well it's just
[1:33:26] going to be good after this no if you're
[1:33:28] a daughter or son of God Satan's going
[1:33:31] to punch at you you just need to be
[1:33:33] aware of it and then so then we need to
[1:33:36] get like Paul and that's not an easy
[1:33:38] thing to do to where we can glory in our
[1:33:41] infirmities and in our troubles and in
[1:33:44] our trials or as Peter says the trial of
[1:33:46] your faith being more precious than of
[1:33:50] gold it's not intuitive to think that
[1:33:52] way but but it's scripture it's the
[1:33:54] truth it is the way God works we should
[1:33:56] not be so alarmed that we have trouble
[1:34:00] now sometimes people have trouble
[1:34:01] because of things they do but as
[1:34:02] Christians you're going to you're going
[1:34:05] to have trouble because that's part of
[1:34:08] the testing and the trying and Satan is
[1:34:10] allowed to punch at us as long as we're
[1:34:13] here on this Earth he said until you're
[1:34:15] finished on Earth just remember that
[1:34:17] brother Bram said and I know this isn't
[1:34:20] a popular thing but he said you'll never
[1:34:23] have a time but when there's a punching
[1:34:26] going on all the time so so if we're
[1:34:30] looking for that we' need to change our
[1:34:32] thinking you're going to get you're
[1:34:34] going to get wore out thinking I just
[1:34:36] need to endure this because it's going
[1:34:37] to there's going to be a relapse no he's
[1:34:39] going to do that because that's his job
[1:34:41] and God's allowing it to keep us humble
[1:34:44] to build our faith to test us many
[1:34:46] reasons but he allows it doesn't mean
[1:34:49] that God's not with you doesn't mean
[1:34:50] that you're not going to overcome you
[1:34:52] will overcome
[1:34:54] just understand that it's there and if
[1:34:55] anything it's a sign it's really a sign
[1:34:58] that you're on the right road to know
[1:35:00] that Satan is coming at you the way he
[1:35:02] does because you look out in the world
[1:35:03] and that's why people do and they see
[1:35:05] people going and living their sinful
[1:35:07] lives and they seem like they're happy a
[1:35:09] lot of them out there are happy they are
[1:35:11] they go through things but they don't
[1:35:12] seem to go through things we go through
[1:35:14] why because their punishment is deferred
[1:35:17] their punishment's coming but as a bride
[1:35:20] we have to stand before Christ spotless
[1:35:22] and so God is is preparing us now we're
[1:35:25] going through all these things now but
[1:35:27] one day it'll be over for the sinner
[1:35:30] they have a reckoning day coming you
[1:35:32] don't if you're a CH son and daughter of
[1:35:34] God you don't have a reckoning day
[1:35:36] coming you're going to stand before God
[1:35:38] an
[1:35:38] overcomer well you got to have something
[1:35:40] to overcome brother bam said if you're
[1:35:42] going to be an
[1:35:44] overcomer 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:35:47] 11 I want to read about Paul just to
[1:35:49] show you the things that Paul went
[1:35:51] through we think oh we go through a lot
[1:35:53] well well let's look at what Paul went
[1:35:55] through a little bit and I think maybe
[1:35:57] it'll put some things in per
[1:36:02] perspectives Paul recognizes his
[1:36:04] ministry verse 23 2 Corinthians 11 and
[1:36:06] 23 read a few
[1:36:09] verses he said are they Ministers of
[1:36:11] Christ he said I speak as a fool so Paul
[1:36:14] you know he he's he's kind of boasting
[1:36:16] but yet he's recognizing it's just the
[1:36:19] grace of God he said I I am more and
[1:36:21] labors more abundant in Stripes so here
[1:36:25] here he's he's bragging but look what
[1:36:27] he's bragging about in Stripes above
[1:36:29] measure in prisons more frequent in
[1:36:33] deaths
[1:36:34] of now most of us in our whole lifetime
[1:36:37] won't experience any of these things of
[1:36:40] the Jews five times received I 40
[1:36:42] Stripes save one now Paul is not I want
[1:36:47] you to know because when we get to the
[1:36:48] end of this you'll see it Paul's not
[1:36:49] complaining here he's just letting
[1:36:51] people know what he's experiencing
[1:36:55] verse 25 Thrice I was beaten with rods
[1:36:57] once I was stoned Thrice I suffered
[1:37:00] shipwreck a night in the day I have been
[1:37:03] in the deep in journeyings often in
[1:37:07] Perils of waters in Perils of robbers
[1:37:10] perils by my own countrymen in perils by
[1:37:13] the Heathen in perils in the city in
[1:37:16] perils in the wilderness in perils in
[1:37:18] the sea and perils among false brethren
[1:37:23] in weariness and painfulness in
[1:37:26] watchings often in hunger and thirst in
[1:37:30] fastings often in cold and in
[1:37:34] nakedness besides so besides he said
[1:37:37] those things that are without that which
[1:37:39] cometh upon me daily the care of all the
[1:37:44] churches I'm TI it makes me tired just
[1:37:46] think just reading about what Paul
[1:37:49] experienced thinking about all of those
[1:37:51] things and a lot of the inspirational
[1:37:53] writings of Paul he didn't write them in
[1:37:55] the comfort of his easy chair at home he
[1:37:57] was in prison and he wrote things that
[1:38:00] we get great inspiration out of him here
[1:38:02] he's in a compromis he he doesn't have
[1:38:04] his freedom and here he's writing things
[1:38:07] to exhort the people that's what he did
[1:38:09] that was his gift that's what God was
[1:38:11] using him
[1:38:12] for verse 29 who is weak and I'm not
[1:38:16] weak who is
[1:38:18] offended and I burn
[1:38:21] not so Paul didn't just deal with those
[1:38:23] things from without he dealt with it
[1:38:24] just like we do from within the
[1:38:26] bickerings and things that happen in
[1:38:28] families and in churches and all that
[1:38:29] it's everywhere and he's dealing with
[1:38:31] that too verse 30 notice this now if I
[1:38:36] must needs
[1:38:37] Glory comes back to what we read before
[1:38:40] I will glory of the things which concern
[1:38:43] M
[1:38:44] infirmities you know I haven't heard too
[1:38:46] many people brag about that I haven't
[1:38:48] heard too many people look at that as a
[1:38:51] positive thing most of us when we're
[1:38:53] boasting thing we're boting about God
[1:38:55] healed and and we should we we need to
[1:38:56] thank the Lord for the things he does
[1:38:58] for us don't ever stop doing
[1:39:00] that but not too many people give glory
[1:39:03] for
[1:39:03] being in trouble and being in distress
[1:39:07] or being in a sickness or being and and
[1:39:09] and we know that some of these things
[1:39:11] for us are just things that we're
[1:39:12] experiencing and God's going to deliver
[1:39:14] and and sometimes it's just for that but
[1:39:17] if God does allow us to go through a
[1:39:19] long trial you know it's often it's
[1:39:21] often a burdensome thing but with Paul
[1:39:24] he said if I'm going to glory in
[1:39:25] anything he said I'm going to glory in
[1:39:27] my
[1:39:30] infirmities not an easy thing to
[1:39:32] do Paul with that great Revelation
[1:39:36] brother BR said the only reason he was
[1:39:37] given The Thorn In the Flesh was to keep
[1:39:39] him down so that he wouldn't get big and
[1:39:42] exalted God kept him down and
[1:39:46] small but really Paul wasn't small but
[1:39:48] he was he got that's the way he was in
[1:39:51] his in his own mind it kept Paul humble
[1:39:54] in the condition so that he could use
[1:39:56] him brother Bram said so he could use
[1:39:59] him in different parts of the country
[1:40:01] doe for him what he wanted to because he
[1:40:03] had the revelation of Jesus Christ who
[1:40:05] he was so he had a great ministry a
[1:40:07] great calling but God had to give him
[1:40:10] that in order for him to be able to give
[1:40:12] that to the people of his day and for us
[1:40:14] to then benefit from it as well he had
[1:40:16] to keep Paul humble with this Thorn In
[1:40:18] the Flesh now we don't have maybe that
[1:40:21] gift but all of us have something as as
[1:40:23] I said that God wants to do with us and
[1:40:25] so whatever it is you know the more God
[1:40:28] blesses us you you can expect that God
[1:40:30] is also going to temper that with things
[1:40:33] that are designed to keep us in a humble
[1:40:36] condition brother Bram says it too for
[1:40:38] about his own Ministry he said I I have
[1:40:41] a thorn in the flesh an angel of Satan
[1:40:43] who follows and tries to buffet or
[1:40:46] beset but he's been defeated he said in
[1:40:49] every case by the Holy
[1:40:52] Spirit but AB brah dealt with a lot of
[1:40:54] things with all the sicknesses and
[1:40:55] things that were healed under his
[1:40:57] ministry he dealt himself with
[1:40:58] sicknesses and infirmities he would get
[1:41:00] an injury and you know he'd go pray for
[1:41:02] somebody and here he's dealing with
[1:41:04] something himself that would linger and
[1:41:05] linger and linger in his own
[1:41:08] life when he had his accident you all
[1:41:10] know that Billy Paul said why don't you
[1:41:12] just speak the word you know but the
[1:41:13] gift that brother bradam had wasn't for
[1:41:15] him it was for us
[1:41:16] others same as yours and mine is too to
[1:41:19] our Ministries and whatever it is that
[1:41:21] God has called us and everyone has some
[1:41:23] kind of a Ministry you know whatever it
[1:41:26] is it's it's not for you you're going to
[1:41:29] get benefited from others you know I
[1:41:31] have a Ministry and I trust that it's a
[1:41:33] help to people but when I need help I
[1:41:35] don't I can't lean on that I look for
[1:41:38] God to use someone else I look for
[1:41:41] somebody else and and God does God steps
[1:41:43] in and it could be a minister it could
[1:41:45] just be a lay person could be anything
[1:41:47] that that God uses I I can't rely on
[1:41:50] myself to help myself but yet sometimes
[1:41:52] we do have to encourage ourselves like
[1:41:55] David did but still our gifts are for
[1:41:58] are for
[1:42:00] others we're in this flesh you know and
[1:42:03] it's it's here it's a sticker brother
[1:42:04] Bram called it he called it the greatest
[1:42:06] enemy he called him he said the greatest
[1:42:08] enemy I have is William brandom he said
[1:42:11] he's the one that gets in the way and
[1:42:13] you know sometimes we like to blame our
[1:42:16] lack of success on or or or our
[1:42:19] spiritual walk maybe on somebody else
[1:42:20] that we feel has done something to hurt
[1:42:22] us but but we're Our Own Worst Enemy the
[1:42:25] one that we look at in the mirror every
[1:42:27] morning they're the one brother Brown
[1:42:28] said he's the one that gets lazy he's
[1:42:30] the one that gets to a place where he
[1:42:32] thinks he can do something and when he
[1:42:34] does he shov shoves God out of the
[1:42:36] picture speaking about himself he said
[1:42:38] when I can get rid of that guy when I
[1:42:40] can get to the place that he's out of
[1:42:41] the way then God can come over and do
[1:42:44] things that William brandom knows
[1:42:45] nothing about and he said that's when
[1:42:48] God can use you he can use you and any
[1:42:50] of us he said when we can get out of the
[1:42:54] way but he said as long as we got
[1:42:56] ourselves in the way then we
[1:42:59] can't now Paul here in the same passage
[1:43:02] of scripture in 2 Corinthians
[1:43:05] 12 you
[1:43:07] know Jesus told him my grace is
[1:43:10] sufficient and he said I take pleasure
[1:43:13] in in in in in verse 10 he said
[1:43:16] therefore I take
[1:43:19] pleasure in infirmities and in
[1:43:21] reproaches and and in NE necessities and
[1:43:25] in persecutions and in distresses for
[1:43:28] Christ's sake for when I am weak then am
[1:43:32] I
[1:43:34] strong so every time when Paul got into
[1:43:37] this condition and I have seen it as I
[1:43:38] said my own Ministry there have been
[1:43:40] times when I've been so distressed and
[1:43:42] so upset and maybe nervous before
[1:43:45] ministering that I almost wasn't sure I
[1:43:47] was going to be able to function and it
[1:43:50] and and without fail it was in those
[1:43:51] times when and something unique happen
[1:43:55] something special would happen that you
[1:43:57] could never have anticipated you think
[1:43:59] well you're the worst prepared you could
[1:44:01] possibly be you're not even fit to go
[1:44:02] out you don't feel you know confident
[1:44:05] and all those things and that's when God
[1:44:06] does the most it's when you feel the
[1:44:08] least and so so I as I recognize that I
[1:44:12] I constantly try every time when
[1:44:15] whatever I'm trying to do for the Lord
[1:44:16] to to try to get myself to where I'm not
[1:44:19] putting anything of myself into it but
[1:44:21] Lord if you don't do something something
[1:44:23] nothing's going to get done if you don't
[1:44:25] help me nothing's going to get
[1:44:29] done my strength God said to Paul
[1:44:32] brother Brown said my strength is made
[1:44:34] perfect is perfect in your weakness my
[1:44:36] strength becomes more perfect as you
[1:44:38] become more
[1:44:40] weaker my strength becomes more perfect
[1:44:42] as you become more weaker the more that
[1:44:44] you can yield to me the better I can use
[1:44:45] you the more you can forget about your
[1:44:47] education the more you can forget about
[1:44:49] your denomination and that didn't mean
[1:44:51] that Paul forsook it his education we
[1:44:53] know God that he still used it for for
[1:44:56] purposes but he never relied on it it
[1:44:58] wasn't what he depended on he depended
[1:45:00] on God the more you can forget about
[1:45:03] your stuff and yield yourself to me the
[1:45:05] more I can use you because you become
[1:45:07] weak I'll make my own purpose strong and
[1:45:11] so God can make strength out of weakness
[1:45:14] like we read in Hebrews 11 out of
[1:45:16] weakness they were made strong out of
[1:45:19] weakness and humility God chooses people
[1:45:22] to build his kingdom out of he said if
[1:45:25] we ever get to heaven if we ever stand
[1:45:27] in the presence of God with his church
[1:45:30] he said we'll stand in a bunch of people
[1:45:31] that's been weak and rejected and cast
[1:45:33] out by the world and know it nothings
[1:45:37] know it nothings is what he called them
[1:45:39] he said isn't it strange that God
[1:45:41] likened us to sheep sheep who are
[1:45:43] helpless you know the the other animals
[1:45:45] they have defenses some have are
[1:45:47] predators and they do things and others
[1:45:49] have defenses but sheep don't really
[1:45:51] have any defense whatsoever
[1:45:53] and God likened us to that why because
[1:45:55] the Sheep depends on the shepherd we
[1:45:57] depend on our
[1:46:01] shepherd He said we get to that place
[1:46:04] brother Bram said that's the way God
[1:46:06] wants us to realize we're totally
[1:46:08] insufficient then he said God takes that
[1:46:11] person and begins to mold himself into
[1:46:14] the person and make his hands do what
[1:46:16] God would have hands to do make his lips
[1:46:19] speak what God's lips would speak
[1:46:22] because they're not his is their gods
[1:46:24] see brother Brandon when he would get
[1:46:25] there in those discernments he would be
[1:46:27] so in tune with God that the Holy Spirit
[1:46:30] would come and speak through him and
[1:46:31] that he when it was done he didn't even
[1:46:33] know what he
[1:46:35] said I mean that that would be amazing
[1:46:37] that we could get to such a place that
[1:46:39] God could just use us and we don't even
[1:46:41] realize what we're doing you know the
[1:46:43] the Holy Spirit a life of the holy ghost
[1:46:46] in a person that causes them to live a
[1:46:49] certain way brother Brown said it's an
[1:46:50] automatic life lived you just do the
[1:46:53] right thing that there's something in
[1:46:55] your nature and you just do that we are
[1:46:57] God's hands we're God's lips he said he
[1:47:00] begins to build a character God speaking
[1:47:03] of God begins to build a character
[1:47:04] begins to take this weakness and to make
[1:47:07] his own
[1:47:09] self if you go back to the the
[1:47:11] beginnings with cainan and Abel and when
[1:47:13] God slew Abel we were left with Seth and
[1:47:17] Cain's line those two lines brother Bram
[1:47:19] said God side to contrast the two he
[1:47:22] said God side
[1:47:23] was weak and humble that's how God used
[1:47:26] them that's God's opportunity it's God's
[1:47:28] way of getting to us is when we are
[1:47:31] weak the case with us he said is not
[1:47:34] that we are too weak but that we are too
[1:47:38] strong he said it's not that the issue
[1:47:40] isn't that we're too weak it's that
[1:47:41] we're too strong he said we're too
[1:47:43] strong-headed too strong in our head we
[1:47:45] know too much and sometimes it's our
[1:47:47] reasoning and so we may we may recognize
[1:47:50] we're weak but then we reason out
[1:47:52] somehow that that God can do something
[1:47:54] with us and so in that way our our head
[1:47:57] gets in the way our thinking gets in the
[1:47:59] way and so brother brandom said it's not
[1:48:01] that we're too weak it's that we're too
[1:48:03] we're too strong we know too much and he
[1:48:05] said God wants to get that out of us he
[1:48:07] said we're too strong to yield to him we
[1:48:11] we want to do something we want to
[1:48:12] control it and it's when we lose that
[1:48:13] control that somehow we lose Faith too
[1:48:16] but that's when we need faith and and
[1:48:19] sometimes we need Faith even if we might
[1:48:20] think we have something we can do
[1:48:23] because sometimes God wants us to just
[1:48:24] take our hands off things because a lot
[1:48:27] of times we cause more problems by
[1:48:28] putting our hands on things that God
[1:48:30] needs to do when it comes to loved ones
[1:48:33] and and you know I know that's a big
[1:48:34] thing for a lot of people myself
[1:48:36] included too but you know the Bible says
[1:48:39] no man can come to me except my father
[1:48:41] draw him and so we have a part to play
[1:48:43] as parents and as family members and as
[1:48:46] as loved ones and as friends to seow
[1:48:48] seeds but beyond that that's all our
[1:48:51] role is we cannot save anyone and not of
[1:48:54] ourselves it's something that God has to
[1:48:56] do we have to apply the token we have to
[1:48:58] put it there and then trust that God in
[1:49:00] his own time not our time our time you
[1:49:03] know would be now you know we don't want
[1:49:05] to see anybody out there not serving the
[1:49:07] lord you know especially our loved ones
[1:49:09] you know it's it's discouraging and all
[1:49:11] of that but but God has a path for
[1:49:13] everyone to walk and we might think it
[1:49:16] should be the same path we walked but it
[1:49:18] isn't always God chooses to allow people
[1:49:21] to go different roads and sometimes
[1:49:22] times those roads cause scars and all
[1:49:24] that we know that but that doesn't
[1:49:26] change God can save uh people in any
[1:49:29] condition no matter if they go astray
[1:49:31] whatever they do God can bring them
[1:49:34] back I want to speak about Dwight Moody
[1:49:36] for a few moments I'm not I haven't even
[1:49:38] been watching my
[1:49:40] time but you can ring the bell or put
[1:49:43] the sign up you know the time's up
[1:49:46] Dwight Moody I want to talk about him
[1:49:47] for a moment we know that he was a
[1:49:49] minister that had great influence
[1:49:52] thousands maybe millions of people that
[1:49:54] that come to the Lord through his his
[1:49:55] ministry but his upbringing was very was
[1:49:58] very simple and very humble he was born
[1:50:00] into a bankrupt family of nine
[1:50:03] children his father loved to drink and
[1:50:05] he died when Dwight Moody was only four
[1:50:08] years old so he was raised basically by
[1:50:11] by his mom he made a statement one time
[1:50:14] he said the world has yet to see so this
[1:50:16] was a determination he had and I don't
[1:50:18] think it was an arrogant statement he
[1:50:20] made but it turned out to be I believe
[1:50:22] quite true for him but he said the world
[1:50:24] has yet to see what God can do with a
[1:50:26] man fully consecrated to him and he said
[1:50:29] by God's help I aim to be that man and
[1:50:32] of course he was he was a shoe cobbler
[1:50:35] brother brandham said he was weak this
[1:50:37] is Brother bram's description of him he
[1:50:38] said he was an example of weakness it
[1:50:41] says that his grammar was was terrible
[1:50:43] he didn't have education and a man come
[1:50:45] up and criticized his grammar he said
[1:50:47] your grammar is the poorest I ever heard
[1:50:50] and of course you know this I'm I'm sure
[1:50:52] you've all heard this the statement he
[1:50:53] made he said I'm winning Souls with my
[1:50:54] ignorance what are you doing with your
[1:50:57] education and brother Bram said I
[1:50:59] thought that was a good answer and it's
[1:51:01] true he was weak in education weak in
[1:51:04] speech he whined through his nose he had
[1:51:06] a nasal condition why would he have that
[1:51:08] you know for some people that would be
[1:51:09] distraction You' think why would God
[1:51:11] allow that but he but it was something
[1:51:12] for people to criticize he was a little
[1:51:14] short fellow physically was a wreck he
[1:51:16] had nothing but weakness continually but
[1:51:19] God used him to shake the world in his
[1:51:21] day they brought a reporter one time to
[1:51:24] the meeting and and they and they set
[1:51:26] through the meeting and they said you
[1:51:29] know I don't know what would attract
[1:51:31] anyone to to come and here you know
[1:51:33] Dwight Moody you know he it's the
[1:51:36] poorest preacher and all talked about
[1:51:38] all the things that was that was bad
[1:51:41] told him said he was ugly and all of
[1:51:43] these things and he said I don't see
[1:51:44] anything in Dwight Moody that would
[1:51:46] attract the attention of anybody well
[1:51:48] when Dwight Moody heard that I mean he
[1:51:50] felt really good about it he said
[1:51:51] because they don't he said they don't
[1:51:52] come to see me they come to see
[1:51:56] God and so if we can get to that place
[1:51:58] in our life that when we're doing
[1:51:59] something for God it's so inconspicuous
[1:52:03] that that people see God and not see you
[1:52:06] they see God and not see me my my
[1:52:09] greatest accomplishment today would be
[1:52:12] that that God would speak and I've seen
[1:52:13] it happen in in services and I've gone
[1:52:15] and people you know would come and say
[1:52:18] that God had spoken very personally very
[1:52:20] direct to them and so for me it's great
[1:52:22] because I have no way to know and so I
[1:52:25] know that that's not me it's not that
[1:52:27] it's not that I like I know that this
[1:52:29] person has this issue so I'm going to
[1:52:30] hit that
[1:52:32] thing I go to places I don't know what
[1:52:34] their issues are but some of them go
[1:52:36] come and say you know you you walked
[1:52:38] right down through my life and so so
[1:52:40] that that makes me feel that God spoke
[1:52:44] to them not me because I know that I
[1:52:46] have no way to know those things and
[1:52:48] that's the way God wants to use you to
[1:52:50] to speak to people not from some
[1:52:53] great Insight that you have that you go
[1:52:55] there feel well I've got something I can
[1:52:56] say to them well if you do that you're
[1:52:58] not going to accomplish anything you've
[1:53:00] got to go in humbleness sometimes people
[1:53:02] go astray or you got somebody in the
[1:53:03] church that needs you know and the Bible
[1:53:05] says that they were Are Spiritual go to
[1:53:07] those that are weak and we need to do
[1:53:09] that but we also need to be very humble
[1:53:11] about that approach and how we do that
[1:53:14] because we can just cause more trouble
[1:53:16] if we go about it thinking well I I can
[1:53:18] help them I can say this I can say that
[1:53:20] or I can do this you're not going to
[1:53:21] accomplish any anything like
[1:53:25] that now Moses we we'll talk about Moses
[1:53:28] for a moment I'm getting down to the end
[1:53:30] here now Moses you know we know that
[1:53:32] that God took all of his ability and
[1:53:36] education out of him so different than
[1:53:38] Paul he sent him out into the Wilderness
[1:53:41] and he put him out there and he he's a
[1:53:42] Shepherd for 40 years and got married
[1:53:45] and you know he he gone had to get that
[1:53:48] all of that confidence that that he had
[1:53:50] and all of that ability all those things
[1:53:52] things he had learned down there and I
[1:53:54] it's a good example for us to show that
[1:53:56] that God can give you what you need you
[1:53:58] may not feel you have it Moses got to a
[1:54:01] place where he didn't feel adequate to
[1:54:03] go down well that was God that got him
[1:54:05] to that
[1:54:07] place see brother Bram said if you if
[1:54:09] you're like to say well brother I can
[1:54:11] preach he see he said he can't use you
[1:54:13] as long as you can preach see if you say
[1:54:16] well I can preach he said he can't use
[1:54:17] you as long as you can preach I can do
[1:54:19] this I can do that he said 'y you can't
[1:54:21] do nothing'
[1:54:26] he said you cannot depend on your
[1:54:27] natural abilities and he said there's
[1:54:29] one thing I admire about Moses he he had
[1:54:32] sense enough to know when he was licked
[1:54:34] is the way brother Bram described it he
[1:54:37] had sense enough to know and here's it's
[1:54:38] interesting I'm going to throw this out
[1:54:40] and this is a kind of an interesting
[1:54:42] thing and we we think well why would God
[1:54:44] do
[1:54:45] this God took him out in the backside of
[1:54:48] the the the desert brother brandham said
[1:54:51] and he used this expression to learn him
[1:54:53] some human
[1:54:54] weaknesses to learn him some human
[1:54:58] weaknesses because you know he didn't
[1:55:00] have any when he went out there he was
[1:55:02] pretty confident in his abilities he
[1:55:03] took him out there to learn him some
[1:55:06] human weaknesses
[1:55:07] well what did he use to do that is the
[1:55:11] interesting part because we think well
[1:55:13] God would have went out and talk to him
[1:55:14] in the wilderness no no wasn't that at
[1:55:17] all it was his wife so Moses the Bible
[1:55:21] says Moses was a man Meek above all men
[1:55:23] on the Earth but Moses also had a temper
[1:55:26] odd seems like a almost a paradox to
[1:55:29] that someone could be meek and yet have
[1:55:30] a temper at the same time but Moses had
[1:55:32] a
[1:55:34] temper and you know in a marriage it's
[1:55:37] good sometimes to to have that those two
[1:55:40] sides to to have a Harmony there but in
[1:55:43] this situation God chose to give him a
[1:55:46] wife who had a temper as well and this
[1:55:49] is what brother brandham said and it was
[1:55:50] for this purpose that we're talking
[1:55:52] about
[1:55:52] about he said God must have had a time
[1:55:55] with him back there Moses had a temper
[1:55:56] and God gave him a wife by the name of
[1:55:59] zapara and she had one two he said I
[1:56:02] imagined things wasn't so pleasing On
[1:56:04] The Backs side of the desert for a while
[1:56:06] when both of their tempers got out of
[1:56:08] control at the same
[1:56:09] time now here's Moses one of the
[1:56:12] greatest prophets of the Old
[1:56:14] Testament we think well how could that
[1:56:16] be God but it was God or God ordained
[1:56:20] that wife for Moses and that conflict
[1:56:23] that naturally would have toen Place
[1:56:25] taken place was by
[1:56:27] Design he said I I imagine things
[1:56:29] weren't so pleasing when they got their
[1:56:31] tempers out of control at the same time
[1:56:33] he said I suppose his intellectual
[1:56:35] conception of how psychology ought to
[1:56:37] control a person because he probably had
[1:56:39] his ideas about that brother BR said it
[1:56:42] didn't do much
[1:56:43] good he said when they got down on their
[1:56:45] Road Zapora he said still had the temper
[1:56:47] she cut the foreskin off and threw it
[1:56:49] before Moses you're a bloody husband to
[1:56:51] me
[1:56:52] he said I guess there was a little
[1:56:54] things that God had to teach him back
[1:56:55] there that he was
[1:56:57] human that he was a human all of his
[1:57:00] wisdom and his powers and all that God
[1:57:02] could not use any of those things that
[1:57:05] he had learned down there in
[1:57:07] Egypt and then brother man makes a
[1:57:09] statement did God feel sorry for Moses
[1:57:11] and his weaknesses no God wasn't sorry
[1:57:14] for him he never took pity on
[1:57:17] him no he wasn't sorry for him he he he
[1:57:20] put him in in that he put him in that c
[1:57:22] circumstance God said 40 years out here
[1:57:24] I've had you and Zapora fussing and
[1:57:26] carrying around in this Wilderness
[1:57:28] whether you could find out there's human
[1:57:30] weakness or not and you're out in the
[1:57:32] desert with a bunch of sheep and a
[1:57:33] high-tempered wife he said that fixed
[1:57:35] him
[1:57:36] up Moses in an awful shape yeah you
[1:57:40] won't hear Too Many preachers use this
[1:57:41] quote but it's but I'm telling you
[1:57:43] that's what brother Brown said he said
[1:57:45] now I can use you when you realize
[1:57:47] you're nothing Moses needed that he he
[1:57:50] wasn't in the place now God could have
[1:57:51] chose somebody else but no Moses was the
[1:57:53] one that God had
[1:57:55] predestinated he said I can use you when
[1:57:57] you realize you're nothing he said give
[1:57:59] us and God he said God give us some more
[1:58:01] of that kind now he's now the statement
[1:58:03] he's about to make isn't talking about
[1:58:04] high tempered he said give us more of
[1:58:07] that kind give us more
[1:58:10] weaklings he said that's what we need
[1:58:13] some
[1:58:15] weaklings so that's his call he's in
[1:58:19] search of of weaklings of weakness n and
[1:58:23] we all can identify with it but can we
[1:58:26] identify that God might in spite of our
[1:58:28] weakness want to use us when we're in
[1:58:31] those conditions where we don't feel
[1:58:33] adequate because that's really what it's
[1:58:35] all about instead of saying Lord I I
[1:58:38] can't do anything for you because I've
[1:58:40] got this and that now sin is a different
[1:58:42] story we're not talking just about Sin
[1:58:44] uh you know if you've got something in
[1:58:46] your life you need delivered then you
[1:58:47] need delivered and but as far as
[1:58:50] weakness and the human weakness where
[1:58:53] sometimes we say and do things out of
[1:58:54] term that that we're always going to
[1:58:55] deal with some of those
[1:58:57] things but it's that condition that we
[1:59:00] can get into where we have to totally
[1:59:01] depend upon God can we get there because
[1:59:04] that's how God is going to do something
[1:59:06] with
[1:59:07] us he says this he said today we know we
[1:59:10] need a Revival we know we need a
[1:59:12] stirring among the people and we all
[1:59:14] look for that we desire that we know
[1:59:16] we're at the end we know it's dark and
[1:59:18] and we know there's not going to be a
[1:59:19] sweeping worldwide Revival we're past
[1:59:21] that but I believe that there can be and
[1:59:23] preachers preach it I I believe that too
[1:59:25] that God can stir us and give us a
[1:59:28] Revival Among Us he can give a give us a
[1:59:30] Revival in our local
[1:59:32] church but he said this he said it'll
[1:59:34] not take a doctor of
[1:59:36] divinity here's what brother Bram said
[1:59:38] it would take to bring that he said
[1:59:40] it'll take a
[1:59:42] weakling that'll take the word of God in
[1:59:44] the power and resurrection of Christ
[1:59:46] well how can they do that they can do
[1:59:47] that by not putting any of themselves in
[1:59:50] it but let God work through them
[1:59:52] in their weakness brother BR said we
[1:59:54] needed David on trained in theological
[1:59:56] schools we need a man who knows nothing
[1:59:58] about that some little plow boy or
[2:00:00] something some little guy with stoop
[2:00:02] shoulders not much to look at come down
[2:00:05] walking down the road with the power of
[2:00:09] God
[2:00:13] weakness so that's what God has always
[2:00:17] used is people who are willing to submit
[2:00:20] to that I know we don't emphasize it
[2:00:23] but I want to close with just a couple
[2:00:24] of quotes here brother Brown said it's
[2:00:26] the Simplicity of the Gospel that
[2:00:28] staggers the
[2:00:31] people he said they they'll they make it
[2:00:33] a great intellectual something or
[2:00:35] another but he said it's the simpleness
[2:00:37] god takes the very tool of humility and
[2:00:40] weakness and simplicity to work his
[2:00:43] works with sometimes we make it so
[2:00:46] complicated and so mysterious that that
[2:00:48] it just can't be grasped that's not what
[2:00:50] this message come to do this message
[2:00:52] come to take the mystery out of things
[2:00:54] not put more mystery into it it's the
[2:00:57] simpleness brother Bram said God takes
[2:00:59] the very tool of humility and weakness
[2:01:01] and simplicity to work his works
[2:01:04] with think about John the Baptist coming
[2:01:06] out of the Wilderness at 30 years old he
[2:01:08] said I brother BR said I can imagine a
[2:01:10] Blackbeard hanging about his face and
[2:01:12] fuzzy big old piece of sheep skin
[2:01:15] wrapped around him stood in mud up to
[2:01:16] his knees and said I am the one that
[2:01:19] spoke of was spoke of by the prophet
[2:01:21] Isaiah imagine what he looked like to
[2:01:23] the people and so we have it in our mind
[2:01:26] how God would work and who God would use
[2:01:27] and what God would do but God can work
[2:01:29] in the simplest things and in the
[2:01:31] simplest
[2:01:32] ways God's strategy the prophet said
[2:01:36] strategy we think about strategy that's
[2:01:38] a big thing big word God's strategy is
[2:01:41] to take empty human vessels and shake
[2:01:43] the world with
[2:01:45] them at Pentecost what did he do he said
[2:01:47] he took them 10 days to get emptied up
[2:01:51] see
[2:01:52] they were standing there with their
[2:01:53] vessels turned up and God filled them
[2:01:56] and then they shook the world poured
[2:01:58] himself into them he said that's what we
[2:02:01] need today is empty vessels that God can
[2:02:04] fill God can use them but if they're
[2:02:08] already filled up with other things God
[2:02:09] can't do anything he can't pour anything
[2:02:11] into them he needs empty vessels that he
[2:02:13] can fill and we
[2:02:15] know that we're living in an hour like
[2:02:19] no other where the enemy is you know the
[2:02:22] demons have been loosed on this world
[2:02:25] and they're just everywhere we're
[2:02:27] dealing with things that we never had to
[2:02:29] deal with that brother brandham in his
[2:02:32] day didn't have to deal with to the
[2:02:33] extent that we see them now brother
[2:02:35] brandham warned about that too you know
[2:02:37] he said we have you know we have we
[2:02:39] dealt with this and now our children
[2:02:41] have 10 times he talked about that you
[2:02:43] know the the the the demons and the
[2:02:45] problems they're faced what will it be
[2:02:47] for their children when we're in that
[2:02:48] generation now brother Brandon saw it
[2:02:50] getting worse and worse and worse he
[2:02:53] said talk about the lid off the kettle
[2:02:55] demons going around powers of the devil
[2:02:57] under the name of
[2:02:59] Christianity because it's not just the
[2:03:00] ones out there that are so obvious it's
[2:03:02] under the Realms of
[2:03:04] Christianity so all of these movements
[2:03:06] now even with the things that are
[2:03:07] developing with the transgender movement
[2:03:09] all that you know they're not just out
[2:03:11] there anti some of them are Antichrist
[2:03:12] certainly but some of them are trying to
[2:03:14] legitimize what they do some of them are
[2:03:16] trying to suggest somehow that God
[2:03:18] supports what they're doing and so those
[2:03:20] those are spiritual devils out there
[2:03:22] powers of the devil under the name of
[2:03:24] Christianity teaching for doctrines the
[2:03:26] Commandments of men he said who is able
[2:03:29] who is strong enough who's wise enough
[2:03:33] who's powerful enough to tame this
[2:03:36] Legion now this is a very real threat
[2:03:38] this is a very real uh thing that we
[2:03:40] have to deal with these demons that are
[2:03:42] out there oppressing and and possessing
[2:03:44] people and trying to influence us he
[2:03:46] said who's strong enough powerful enough
[2:03:48] to tame this Legion
[2:03:52] he said ' who caname that devil he said
[2:03:55] you you'll do it you'll do it when you
[2:03:58] empty up and become
[2:04:00] weak you'll do it when you'll empty up
[2:04:03] and become weak and pour out all of
[2:04:05] yourself let the Holy Ghost come in and
[2:04:07] flood every part of you saturate every
[2:04:10] lid of your body empty vessels what he
[2:04:12] needs a little minority that will
[2:04:14] receive God's power and blessings in his
[2:04:16] message he said that's what we need get
[2:04:19] weak so you can get strong he said it'll
[2:04:23] conquer every devil it will put the
[2:04:25] learned to shame it'll bring men and
[2:04:27] women who God has
[2:04:29] called those empty vessels those weak
[2:04:31] vessels that are willing to submit
[2:04:33] themselves to God get empty he says as
[2:04:35] I'm closing get empty friends get weak
[2:04:38] deny your own ability put yourself pour
[2:04:40] yourselves on God's altar as a sacrifice
[2:04:43] let the angel come with a fire and fill
[2:04:46] the vessel with the power of almighty
[2:04:48] God then he'll make you strong and he'll
[2:04:51] give you Grace to
[2:04:53] stand the last quote brother Ram said
[2:04:56] when you can become nothing in your own
[2:04:59] sight you're becoming something in God's
[2:05:02] sight then you can become nothing in
[2:05:04] your own sight always be conscious the
[2:05:07] prophet said of your littleness and then
[2:05:10] God can do something with
[2:05:13] you different thought different approach
[2:05:15] to speaking not not the way maybe you
[2:05:18] you would have expected to hear it but
[2:05:21] but I I want to get you know the all of
[2:05:24] us have things we're facing all of us
[2:05:26] have Devils that are tormenting we have
[2:05:29] loved ones we desire to see saved we
[2:05:31] have people that are sick we desire to
[2:05:32] see
[2:05:33] healed but we serve the same God that
[2:05:36] the prophets sered we serve the same God
[2:05:38] of the Bible and sometimes we wonder how
[2:05:41] is this all going to work well any one
[2:05:43] of us God can use to accomplish
[2:05:45] anything but it does come down to that
[2:05:48] approach I think sometimes we emphasize
[2:05:50] so much about about being a assertive
[2:05:52] and exercising power and all of those
[2:05:54] kind and and I believe in all of those
[2:05:56] things too but there's this element of
[2:05:59] weakness this element of humbleness that
[2:06:02] must go with it not not uh fear not fear
[2:06:07] in the sense that we're afraid of the
[2:06:09] devil because the Bible says we can do
[2:06:10] all things through Christ which
[2:06:11] strengthens us we we don't need to have
[2:06:14] fear but we need to approach it with God
[2:06:17] at the Forefront not with saying well I
[2:06:20] can do this I I'm inspired I'm going to
[2:06:23] go do this I'm going to go do that no
[2:06:25] just let God work through you say Lord
[2:06:27] there's a need what can I do how can I
[2:06:29] be yielded to you that you can work
[2:06:31] through me to accomplish something for
[2:06:33] you because he can and he will he wants
[2:06:35] to work through us but sometimes we are
[2:06:39] trying to dictate how that's going to be
[2:06:42] we're trying to take over we're trying
[2:06:43] to take God's role over well it's not up
[2:06:45] to us God we want to be his hands well
[2:06:48] that means we've got to yield our hands
[2:06:50] as long as I've got control of my hands
[2:06:52] how is God going to have control of them
[2:06:54] as long as I'm the one doing the
[2:06:55] speaking with my with my mind how is God
[2:06:58] going to speak through me I've got to
[2:06:59] yield I've got to get to the place
[2:07:01] almost like Moses where I don't even
[2:07:03] know what I should say and then God can
[2:07:05] come in and take this vessel over
[2:07:07] because I've lost control I've let that
[2:07:09] control go to God that's what he's

[2:08:01] he can do anything he can do Miracles he
[2:08:04] can heal he can save he can
[2:08:07] deliver but it's going to take a
