thank you amen Amen row bloodshot so tonight we just want to continue on I did do I did do a portion of this on the token a long time ago so I just wanted to pick it up from there again just bring out a couple of points here won't be too long here on the Wednesday night so we just want to just go over a few things let's turn in Exodus 12 3 to 13 tonight Exodus 12 which is familiar Scripture has to do with again the token the exodus in Egypt at that time we all know there's 3 exodus and that happened in in this age I guess you bring that you can bring that presentation up to other math close it there so Exodus 12 and verse 3 speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next next unto his nose take it according to the number of souls every man according for his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male for the first year all this being a type of course ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and he shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts on the upper door upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it and we know that it's two sides and and the doorpost it's not on the threshold because you cannot walk over that bullet you can't tread down that blood so they only do it decides in the top verse 8 and they shall eat the flesh in the night roast with fire and of course that was Holy Ghost and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs and they shall eat it eat enough of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast would fire his head in his legs and the puritans thereof and it was roasted whole it wasn't divided up it was all had to be eaten and and it's type of the word you know is where that's oh you have to take all the word right so he had to eat all the land you have to take all all the word and consume all the word and live by all the word and it would be a you know good for you so first ten and he and he shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remain of it until the morning he shall burn with fire and thus shall we eat you eat it with your loins gird girded and your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and he shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover first of all for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses were year and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your grace Lord and for the revelation Lord in this hour Lord that you've given us to open up these things Lord to see what time Lord that we live in what age we're in how close we are to the end Lord and we just thank you for your grace or than this in this final hour before wrath comes upon the earth Lord you sent a prophet or to reveal these things to your children Lord that we may be Lord under the blood in this final hour Lord and Lord that we receive salvation and or that we could walk with you Lord in this hour when we claim the rapture is it is about to happen so we thank you Lord for your grace Plus each one we pray in Jesus name Amen amen you may be seated at this time so I should as you know the token marker so as you know this is the token time and brother Branham says many times he says in this and this quote here just warm us up here at the restoration of the bride tree and he says and if for many messengers of death killed a tree for messengers is a little bit of a review here for messengers of life restores the tree do you get it for God said I will restore it he's only Teresa he's going to restore how by for death messengers killed it then for life messengers will restore it and what was the first would Martin Luther justification what was the second john john wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word what the word they were the four great prophets one of them Martin Luther he began to shine a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Along Came Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley came to stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophets II but in the last days of Malachi for Elijah's to come with the very word the Word of God came to the Prophet in the beginning in the evening lights is to come forth to restore and bring back what to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father and this is the fourth light I'll just continue on with the next one here from the token therefore as the evening shadows are appearing and the wrath is ready to be poured out from the out from on high upon the ungodly nations and upon the ungodly unbelievers the professors without a profession upon these things and I've tried to unfold myself and live right among it and see where we're standing before I said these things now we are living in the shadows and the wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back onto the believer so in you know a brother branham goes through it and he says you know we had to have the Holy Ghost in this age and of course we know that that you know there was Holy Ghost sin and all it was Holy Ghost in the day of Pentecost Holy Ghost in all of the ages and just just a little review there but to explain it and brother Branham brother Branham talked about the son of man when it came in it was the fullest or the Holy Ghost the fullness of God in that in that man Jesus Christ who came and then as he as he went and as he went on the cross and was crucified and he was died and was buried resurrected and came into the Upper Room at that time you know D he came as the Son of God it was the son of God then when his his spirit and it was the first time in the last last time we talked about the promise in Ezekiel 37 that he said I will sanctify thee and that was the promise that he would come in and be in his children he would sanctify his his own and he would by the Holy Ghost come into each one's heart and there would be a holy holy life for God to dwell in and that's what he would manifest in his age in order to bring us all back to the beginning and to redeem each one back to into the presence of God wants more so he would sanctify he would sanctify each one and that's what was the beginning of it the fulfillment of it there in the upper room and of course knowing that there was a whole plan of God but in that night and it was it was the first time it was a it was a wonderful wonderful period in the in the whole plan of God was that perón and you know what they were like you know they were they were there and Jesus was raised and he was he was waiting for the 50th day where it would be Pentecost and and and he told the disciples to go into the upper room and to to wait to be endued with power from on high because they were they knew he was a king and they knew there was going to be a kingdom but they were still looking for a physical Kingdom but it wasn't going to be like at that at that point in that period of history it wasn't going to be like that it was going to be the Holy Spirit and the fulfilling fulfillment of those scriptures that he would come and live in a people in a body of people and he would sanctify them and the Holy Ghost would would be their guide in that age so what happened on the day of Pentecost is where they were talking about when his kingdom would come and he say you know you will be in do it on par with power that was the Holy Ghost and that's what happened then so 120 they're right in the Holy Ghost and they were there waiting you know just like us you know you were waiting and you know for the God God's promise to be fulfilled and you know they some of them went back working before that you know before Jesus came and told him you know go and wait for me in the in the upper room in Galilee and then the Holy Ghost came and then there was no difference so at that point a hundred and twenty people became like that one person there was 120 Jesus there and this is you know like if someone like Saul maybe who was watching all this you know there was troublesome you know because he was he would they were trying to eliminate this from Israel and from Jerusalem but at that point you know when they were in dude were on would power on high it became very difficult because there was 120 and then when Peter spoke there was another 3,000 and it started to quickly multiply and these people were full of the Holy Ghost this was the full word coming coming to those people at that time and it was a it was something that wasn't going to be stopped right away I mean it was it was going to be carried I was through out the wall in a very short time when this would spread through so so we know that we talked of you know we talk about the holy holy ghost and then know if that's you know it's it's kind of a stumbling as Burberry explains he talks about the Holy Ghost to have to have the Holy Ghost what we think in terms of Luther and he says Luther had the Holy Ghost and he'll say that you know Wesley had the Holy Ghost and Pentagon said the Holy Ghost not add up you know and then Birdman citizen they told me he gotta have the Holy Ghost and just to differentiate differentiate it out you know it takes he does explain it in there and how it would look just a half hour before really helps you know before you come out here so we so in this case here we see that so with how like how I draw and erase it so here just so we see it so we see in the first I'll just stare with the first four the first four ages here and the church ages and before I say that in here brother Branham explained about the prism and when the dawn when the son of man was here was the fullness fullness in in Jesus Christ he was the fullness of God made flesh the son of man that son of man is is is God in flesh and anyone in spirit and became son of God and brother Branham explains it like a prism and he said when the light goes through a prism and he described as father son Holy Ghost and that the light is broken up into seven colors of the rainbow and he said that's what happened with the that's what happened with the son of son of God ministry and what happened is is that that each age received a portion of that spirit it was a it was a an anointing in that in every one of those ages so the sort of Holy Ghost was never in its fullness it was it was it was just a portion of God in each age that would anoint him and it was enough in the first day so would be Paul and he he had the anointing and then right up through all of these messengers up to Luther and Luther in the fifth age he had an anointing and it was a gift gifted a Holy Spirit of justification it was a gift so wasn't the fool and but but Luther didn't live really a holy life as was taught today and any and and God provided the blood that would that would would be there to as a intercession for the sins that were going on in that age but he had but bourbon said he had the Holy Ghost but wasn't all revealed at that time so then when Wesley came along he had sanctification Holy Ghost and the gift of sanctification and he also had this part but he still needed the blood over here to cleanse his sins he still required to blood right up to Pentecost service the sixth age the cementation all of these had a portion of the full anointing of God and there's the Pentecost so we we can see that it was never perfect in those ages well how do you know that well you know that because of all the black right especially at the end it was all black and as you know Burt Branham only put a portion in there was a lot you know the lot that needed to be covered by the blood and and Jesus was over over here in the eternities and he was interested interceding for all all of us all of the Saints Trudie ages but they were Saints they were wise virgins they all will be raptured the ones that that were were his in that bloodline you know that came to that had that portion of the Holy Ghost and it wasn't to discredit that's all that was there at that time in each age right so here they had the in Pentecost they had the gift of the Holy Ghost and that was that was really what brother Brian says is the gifts of the it was just the gifts of the Holy Ghost it was the gifts that were restored in that day and they did have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it wasn't the full word it wasn't a full word it wasn't until this aid this is 7a and this is 7b so if you take the Laodicean age it was really the the first part was the pentecostal age it was all Pentecost but there was a but there was a part in the age in 63 when the word was restored right so then that the full word was restored and that changed things altogether that was a that was a different thing altogether in our age so just uh just to run through here and we know that there was the first Exodus in in in in in in the book of Exodus when Moses was was there and it would there was the second Exodus and third Exodus second Exodus being in Jesus time and then the third Exodus and the last time in our age right so we last time we went through the first Exodus and in the in the second Exodus here we know that you know that the things that we see in these ages is a prophet on the scene and Christ being the prophet in this game he came as a prophet he was he was there as as prophet and then he would be as priests and then he would be as king and we've we got who we went through that in detail priest Trudy's church ages when he was an intercessor and then King in the time under millennium he would be the son of David in the king so here here in we know that Jesus was slain and it was it was the elements of of the Exodus it that it was evening time it was always in the evening time into the last part when there was darkness upon the earth and now we see gross darkness upon the earth upon the people and that's that's the time of the Exodus and there's only been three of these events in you know in all the history of time so in this in this case there was a prophet on the scene just just there was moses in the prophet and we had our prophet in this age and then he was slain as the lamb was slain and he descended into the earth and he was there for three days and then the resurrection and then he made appearances at that time to show that he had risen and then he ascended to the Father because he had to bring that blood sacrifice into and show that he he had come and fulfilled the penalty price of for sin and then and then what happened in here in 33 AD is the upper room and he had told people to go they told us the safest to go into the upper room and wait for him until they are endued with power on unhide did they know what there was no they were still expecting something physical to happen but in this case it was spiritual and in the first Exodus it was the actual blood of the Lamb in here was the in this case it was the blood of Jesus Christ and it wasn't the blood that was going to be applied to anybody it was going to be the life that was in that blood so the actual blood of Jesus just went down into the ground and just disappeared and and into the ground and went back to the earth but that spirit came back as the Holy Spirit and endued those people on high sort of so we see it as the is the first stage at the beginning it is really the first stage I would call it the first stage was really the end of the Old Testament right there was the fulfillment right there of many many things in the Old Testament and we saw the beginning of the New Testament so it was a very pivotal point from that Covenant to the New Covenant and the it it was in that in that period because we know that the first stage when brother Brian puts it out it only started in in 55 ad that's what brother Branham puts that first stage really starting though you know and you know we really see it as it was the beginning of it when the disciples were on the earth but it was a time that that and I first I heard was brother Donnie Reagan saying it is that that there was a bride age right at the beginning of those those years just like we see a bride age at the end there's not that there's another age it's a brother Brennan said bride age and he said bride time and I'll just use bride time here not to confuse anyone that another age because there's only seven ages but there's a portion of time when there was a bride age vertebra and since I call you no more Church I called you bride and in this time time although was not mentioned is that it it it would appear that it was was the same in in the in that that God would show a manifestation of himself in the people that people would recognize and he said in this age it was going to happen as well where he would show that that this this was the right message of all the messages that are on the earth today there is going to be a short period when his his message is going to be manifested on the earth through a people and that's that's a people who will be totally totally slain there be nothing left to those people because he won't share it with anyone he'll never share it with anyone it has to be him so he's gonna all he's gonna do is use that vessel he really doesn't want anything he got if you think he got something that he he wants he doesn't he just wants a someone who can move themselves out of the way and let him come in and dwell and manifest himself and his power in inner people upon the earth and when you saw with brother Graham many times in a prayer line he could move out of it away you wouldn't even know what was going on you know and he'd have to ask you know what happened it was this happened December so that's that's the kind of manifestation that you're gonna see in the last Aeneas and you can read about that in the adoption series he talks about that a fair amount so here we see the the first age and the just that little segment before the really the definition of the first stage is when you know the bride is manifested on earth and if you read in acts 6 it talks about people who are full of the Holy Ghost it is not anywhere partial like this there's nothing partial in it it's the full fullness of the Holy Ghost in these people as as the Bible says and then there was something lost there was something lost you know in in the first stage because it says in the first stage they lost they fell away from their first law they lost her it was the first thing that said in in revelations chapter 2 verse 1 says a 1 or 2 it says they had they fell away from their first love and it started to it started to move away from the the fullness that bride bride time that was there in the first 20 years of since the Upper Room and there we see the token is that that that you know it it had when the token is displayed say in the Old Testament when in the exodus age when when that blood was on the dirt on the door doorposts ended and the and the header that and and then there was blood inside and there was blood outside and Bertram's said it had to be displayed outside it had to be it had to be shown outside and then there was blood inside also but but that but it the most important thing it had to be out being displayed and as they were doing their thing and you know all that they had to do and eat the lamb and sacrifice the lamb and eat eat all of that lamp that was the only that was the only thing that would saved him you know you could say amen to that I mean it was it was only the token and then here the only thing that could be saved at that point was the token here and we're into that same point again now you know here you could you you could be in Haran and and be saved you know it was it was he winked at that ignorance here and he knew what was going on he knew that all of it wasn't revealed at that time that it wasn't the full word it wasn't the full Holy Ghost but when the full Holy Ghost the token comes on the scene when the full Holy Ghost is manifested in in a person then it can only be the message that's it it can only mean where the blood is it can only be where the full Holy Ghost is you have to have that full Holy Ghost you can't be up you can't have that Pentecostal Holy Ghost here and the gifts to the Holy Ghost you have to be under that there's no and and you could before you could hear but you can't hear it has to be it has to be the the message any our the message that the Prophet is bringing that where the blood is because as we said the last time in that quote from indictment I don't have it but the word is is the path to the to the blood the full word and the full blood so in this case is all awful and it's it's in this age and it's in that age and it's in the exodus age and they're all parallel so in this case here he did you notice in the first twenty years you know a lot of scriptures that many of the many of the disciples Paul and Peter and Jude and all these are giving our warnings at this point because they know what's coming they know there's going to be a fallen in a way and we know there's a fallen away we seem to fall in the way you know we've been taught the falling away and ever since that point and we know it from here that it started and more and more until it almost has wiped off the earth especially in the Dark Ages in the fourth age so as an example Jude said beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints he says you really got a hold on to this because there's something coming he they're seeing something come I Peter said I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that he may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come the first delay in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts so they're aware because they're under a full word nothing is sealed in like it got sealed in with John the Revelator and he was two years on that island and he was told to seal up the things that are going to happen and they wouldn't be revealed until now and that seal that sealing up meant that the it was it was put in symbol form and what we saw in our day and we and last time we were talking about this I talked about I I put up the quote about I put up the quote in in the piece of the trumpets and that Christ was freed a bird I'm announced that you know price was creep freed because he was not hindering anymore by creeds and dogmas in denominations because the full word the token had been had come on the scene so now Christ was free you know and that these things would be made known in this age so in this case in this case in the terms of Revelation just like being on the Exodus I don't know if it's parallel or any I'm saying that but in John's time he Saudis he saw John the Revelator he saw these these the what was going to happen and we know that a lot of it has come to pass and a lot of it deals with the three-and-a-half years of tribulation and then after the tribulation when we go into millennium and and the new city etc but a lot of it that he saw was put into symbols form John didn't really understand it all he did he was he saw it he didn't understand the symbols and he wrote he wrote it all down and then there was some there was no there was no symbols at all like the seventh seal the seventh seal didn't have any symbol at all you know the other ones that could say in you know the first horse rider and he had a bow and arrow he had a bowl and no arrows and he was on a white horse and or you know they were timeless scales and you know in the third third seal and stuff like that so they all had a lot of symbols and we we didn't we didn't they were all sealed he said to seal it all up and no one knew it and if you go back and look at the the people who the commentaries and that me you go through all of the different books in the the Bible but if you if you look at revelation they'll say well could be this and it could be hath and wait to this may be that it's hard even to bring it back and of course we know that Burt Brennan did that so when he came along the second time and brother Branham came along and what he did is he basically took away the symbol so we could see the we could see now that you know the horse riders were son Antichrist and things like that so he removed all of those things for the bride and he could he could lay out then not that it was fulfilled but he could say what was gonna come to pass so here when we come along in the Third Age and then in chapter 4 in all the ages in chapter 4 he says come up hither and I'll show you things that was shortly come to pass and then he starts showing us he while you're up there in heavenly places he starts showing of these things of the seals and the ages and what was going to happen in the tribulation and that I thought and all of this he's just taken off the symbols and letting you see it and that was the third third really changing that by removing those symbols and letting you see it and then the last one is in the last day when it actually all comes to pass and some of it has already come to pass and brother Branham told us what what all that meant he told us what the ages what there were seven ages and him represented seven periods and there was a messenger and and a lot of these in in there a lot of times it says angel but it was really people it was messengers - who were on the earth and doing these things so he showed us what has already transpired and then he's showing us what it's going to transpire and in in and you know just listen to like Jenkins and he said that when when you get seven when you get to seven of something then it's revealed it's like the seven ages and in Revelation chapter one there's he talks about he says seven about twenty times because we're in the light he shown that it's in the last age it's in the last of time and then seven everything is revealed so brother Branham he was into the Seventh Seal he could reveal all the other seals and in the seventh age he could reveal all the seals but when it came to the trumpets he couldn't he couldn't reveal that he kind of said I don't know what's one in one two three and four but five and six things he has a view of it because it overlapped with the Gentiles and the seven he couldn't but when that seventh angel comes in revelation 11 when they're there on Israel they will be in the seventh trumpet and they will reveal all the seven trumpets of what they were to the Jews so just like the seals were to us is the same as the trumpets were to the Jews and they'll be in but program couldn't because it wasn't his ministry and he wasn't in seven he got to be in seven that's it I'm saying I'm a numbers guy like that or something but it makes a whole lot of sense that it would be seven and when all of these things are opened up so here in if you come around along in Revelation 2 and revelation 3 and hearing now you're in the seventh age and we go into this little period of the bride age same as over here now you got the bride age then brother Branham was able to reveal all these things and show us what will surely come to pass and it will quickly come to pass and he opened all of that and we know that he spent a lot of time and revealed much and there's much more to be revealed but we know what in Revelation 10 he said that it will be revealed in the last day and it was revealed but doesn't mean we understand at all because it it it's revealed by coming to pass and so we're waiting for it to come to pass and then we see oh well that's what brother Brian said you know and the fivefold ministry does a good job of that so so here so these so these three were we're into this piece of it where it's being revealed to the bride the world still doesn't know it they won't know what they'll never see it they'll be blinded to it unless it's on mr. call to see it because it's because the discreet in Corinthians it says that that will you have to be spiritually discerned and I haven't got that here but sits in it's in first corinthians 3 i think to first corinthians 2 if you want to turn to it just for a second so in just started verse thirteen so this is first Corinthians two and I think it's just not worthy here as I thought it was good we start at verse ten but God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the spirit searches all things she ate two deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so that the Holy Ghost so even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God the Holy Ghost we are endued with power on high that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God verse 13 which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual and verse 14 but the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto them that's why they don't understand what happened in Revelation they still have a veil over them neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned and that and what that means and you can write it in your Bible like I did because it really clarifies it it says spiritually discerned it spiritually understood so it has to be spiritually understood you can't understand it through your mind and that's Revelation it has to be revealed to you right so you you know these things by spiritually you are spiritually discerned so you spiritually understand you spiritually understand them thank God for that so that means you don't have to understand everything but you had to believe it you know you have to believe every word yeah you know you must understand every word no you you have to believe every word it's all according to the heart right you can't leave it off where we have to be mindful of those things that come about in all you know you sound a Peter says there in the second second scripture knowing first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts right and those are the things that would deceive you but we are not of them that drawback amen so we're good and Peter here also would another warning wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make make your calling election Shore for if you do these things you shall never never fall I mean they're just planting seeds here and you know it's right through to the gospel that the epistles there where they're talking about you know there's something coming and you gotta be you know and and it was it was it was hard you know right through the first three Ages it was continued declining even though they're all and still under there was messengers but it was Paul's teaching to us first three ages and the fourth age it was almost white bread off the earth and it was only he's only a little bit of light left there and the Catholic Church came in and were formed and grew and as I said before they still look at it as their glory years the glory years to the Catholic Church then when you know those millions were were you know persecuted and those are the ones they have records for they have records to them you know and we know there's a lot more than that you know but they were keeping records at all so they had full dominion over that whole thing right and and it was certainly a hard time for those in that fourth age and it wasn't until the fifties when Luther started to come back in and and it was just one religion there was just one religion then there was nothing else it was just a Catholic religion and they they they had already said they are going to just dare to go and explain everything you know no one needs to explain anything the church will make a decision on all of those things and it was and then that's what Luther the full thing he was doing was coming in and saying you know you got it wrong and they really went against him for that for that theory that he that the catholic church' was wrong and he said to just shall live by faith and not by an institution or a denomination in those days and then what it did then which was too bad he said if if there wasn't one religion anymore you know one way of doing it there was many many forms you know many denominations and that spirited denomination really went off but they were the daughters of that one and Paul here says and I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw many disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears and and he did because he could they could see it coming two disciples knew what was what was on the mall so it's always evening time and this is just a summary of this three would just get back to that but you see there's just the similarities there's always a pillar of fire and a prophet on the scene and then there's a death angel in each one there's a lamp and then then there's a land of slain in the case of this second act is the exodus that was Calvary and then there was the token was the blood in that age and they took that in the first stage they smeared us in there in order for protection then the second one was the blood of Jesus that came and the life that was in that blood what came in the day of Pentecost and they were in dude with power from on high and the first one that the exodus was over the Red Sea and the same the second Exodus was out of the city of Jerusalem at that time it was destroyed and they went into that Kingdom and due to a time power power in the third thing that we have the same similarities again it's a pillar of fire with with that group and it was a prophet so it was vindicated and there was a death angel in the land and the word was slain there was the indictment and all of this happened in a row and brother Branham was very excited about this when this revelation came and he could see all those things like the seals and all of the the full word coming in the scene again so now the the seven spirits that were coming through the all all the ages now we're up in this cloud and all the seven angels were there they could he saw it in a vision he saw that coming back in the son of man ministry and all those spirits into one again just as brother Branham explained in the prison and if you reverse it it comes back into one and that's what happened there in 1963 is that the son of man ministry started and there was the fullness of Christ and it was brother Branham he learned after it was token time when all of the elements that you see here in the other ages and he could he he equates to token with the exodus so that those three periods that mark really the the you know those divisions over time over all time so the token was there and it was the spirit sober I'm saying you know it's the Holy Spirit but now it's the fullness of the Spirit it was a it wasn't before that the the giver was giving gifts in in each one of those ages but now it was the giver it was the full one and he says that he says it in various areas in different messages where he talks about that this is what happened on that on that on earth in that last age and in that bride time in the last days before the rapture so it's a separation it was the time now where he had to be under that token and that token came through the message became so it was okay before 63 it was okay and he winked at that he winked at the ignorance that was was being taught then and he could like Luther you know Luther was drinking and smoking and and he swore and he wanted to eliminate the Jews and you know all of those things which were wrong in the thing but God winked at it because it was just a start of the restoration and in Wesley come along and you know he he he was justified and he was sanctified but he still had the Trinity he still ordain women preach you know there was a whole lot of things that weren't set in order at that point and God winked at it and same with Pentecost and penny cows thought they would they were there but it wasn't there you know because it denominated they should have never denominated it'll never nominate in this stage so we see here just the fullness coming here now in their spirit that fullness within the second days of now in the third Exodus it was the fullness again and the Exodus here which you know will be the rapture it'll be the rapture the exodus will take us out into the rapture and there will be a tribulation so all similar in nature so back to our timeline right so now we see in 55 the 80 brought around marks the church ages even though it really did kind of start but he just takes into account that bride age and now we see the church ages and and he talks about a chasm here he talks about a chasm I just and it was almost it went on for a long time and a lot of things changed in in that period as you know but it it was a it it couldn't go on that way way all the time it had to change it had there had to turn a corner and it took a profit to turn the corner at that time so so at the beginning at that age it marked the it might deterioration of the of what was delivered on the day of Pentecost when they lost their first love and he he was he was breaking it down in each age you know trying to keep it so this is really what I just drew up on the board ahead of time and you see justification sanctification through all these age and I'll true all of these ages and I just break up the seventh age at 7a and 7b and then we see the Son of man coming back and was in its fullness in this age which is the bride' age and brother Branham announced that he no more calls you church but he calls you bride and that was marking that that change that was going to happen in the last age when the word came on the scene and we saw that in the first quote there so far Brian said desperations and and the Holy Ghost is too token that the blood has been applied because it follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption see that was the purpose of him coming that's what he followed in every age so he he had to go through the ages because to recede in there so so the the first age really could have took a rapture but we know the seed went into the ground and the cornice the corner this the seed corn went into the ground and and came back but in this case here you know they could have took a rapture down in the beginning because the fullness of the Holy Ghost was there but he had a bloodline that it was fallen because he had opened the book he you know there was a there was a plan of redemption and that that was it in a book and when he took that book and he opened a book those were the ones that were going to be redeemed that were in the thoughts of God back in the beginning he would redeem and bring back in rapture so that's what that's what happened in that age so it was real important that in I just kind of rambling a bit here but brother Brian said that the fifth chapter of Revelation was the most important book he said that in in Revelation of the church ages in Chapter five and he said it was the most important so you know because of the church ages and because of all the darkness that that Jesus was over here on the throne in eternity and he was an intercessor so he was gone back and he was sitting on the right hand of the Father and he was then an intercessor for the people in for his his people his children in the image in the ages and in the what happened in in Revelation 5 is that as we read it then there was a the the book was closed and John went in was just that's just like quickly read revelation 5 and verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals around there was no one worthy and weak and we know there was only one worthy and that was Christ and he was over here for the seven ages intercessing for the pit was an intercessor for the people for all the sins and all the things that were covered in Luther's day and the westerlies day and all that and he was interested seating for all of that and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look look upon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David with prevailed to open the book and to loose to seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders to the lamb it had been slain have seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God knows all the sevens is complete and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and that happened Burma and saw that in 63 that that's what that's what really happened is that was being fulfilled that that that Jesus who was who was interceding was came out of eternity and he came and he took that book and he opened the book because in Revelation 10 you see the book opened and in that book was the names of those that had to be redeemed in that age so then what he was doing was calling his bride he was calling his his bride to come stand with him in that period in in 63 and that's why you were called there today because you heard that call and that voice that come and you would stand in that last time in the bride age with the bridegroom and once all of them all of them are comes forth and her names are called and they come to the Holy Ghost then the rapture will take place but this is disi age when he came he came in this age in now it began the capstone age here and then what what you see brother Brian preaching he's he starts preaching in perfect faith right you're in a perfection now right the token is there everything is getting ready now for something that never happened before which is a rapture I needs to be perfect love and everything is everything now is right to the final until this is all formed and seals onto the body so what everyone has to be in there and called and we were just waiting for that last one to come true so he came out of the eternities so he said if ever I'm talking about the age and he says oh we've had a dip of the spirit it was just a portion of that spirit in but a branch language there was only a portion was allotted to each age it wasn't a fullness it wasn't a full token it wasn't a full word it wasn't a full Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost a giver given these gifts in each age right to bring to build up that that Bobby and to call those out that they're his aren't a wise virgins in those ages absolutely there's their water you know Martin Luther will come up in the rapture you know because you know wasn't his fault that the whole world word wasn't revealed if it was real Martin Luther would believe it he would believe it because you know because he was bribed but there was only a portion of the Holy Spirit form that's why brother Branham says in this age in the token he says you know this is the Holy Ghost age what it sounds like you know well huh didn't Luther have that or Wesley no this is the fullness of God the full word being revealed it's the giver himself it's the full full right that will bring a rapture in our age the rest won't be resurrected and we're waiting for a resurrection because the resurrection happens first and then those who are alive and remain are changed but the first thing is is the resurrection and then those that are alive and remain will be changed but the you'll only be a rapture when there's a full word so we've had a dip of the spirit we've had spiritual blessings and spiritual up rises but we didn't we don't need that no more we need a revival of the Spirit of the Living God in the hearts of the people amen some of the Pentecostal people today don't even count Martin Luther and them because they say he didn't have the Holy Ghost he did he might not have had it in the depths that we get it in now but it wasn't for that time what was it it was a body grown from the feet growing up comes up more important parts of the body from the feet and on into the lungs and hearth just building up the body who is the head and this is the word who who is the head that's the intelligence house how's the body move by the head and the government shall be upon watt upon his shoulders his body it got it he didn't have any trouble government you know hit we have trouble with politicians government is not the issue there's where the real true church speaks in this power there's where the Apostolic power returns to the church when the government shall be upon his shoulders judgment there's coming a real church I believe trying to do my part to present it have it ready the best I know how to present my part in my age to Christ when he comes right and this is our part here in the fullness back to our our timeline here so we see in the church ages and there's a there's a chasm he talks about a chasm and it goes into the breech then when it comes to the seals so we see in in 1963 it's when the 3rd Exodus really comes at brother Branham comes on the scene and all of those things that they record that we see similar in other Exodus the 1st and the 2nd the 3rd comes in now we see the pillar fire and the prophet and the the lamb and Barbra MCC sinks now starting to open up from the seals and he says you know that wasn't me to see if that was him he did all of that right but he sees looking at the indictment and he sees the seals being open and the word now is being revealed and he's starting to see oh there's an indictment here you know where they crucified the word and he said starting to see the similarities until he comes and he he preaches to token and he and it's been revealed to him now now that we're in it and age is the evening hour everything is lined up exactly for an exodus in our age and he knows then there's going to be an exodus which would be the rapture not like the second one where it was you know it's similar in that you know there would be you know power from on high and that would come in the bride in this age and he's seeing it but it would cause a rapture would be you know come to the culmination of the time upon earth it would be no more right and he sees it sees how that's gonna happen in Revelation 10 he sees how everything is going to happen so here it's a bride time at the end so and like I said in in the middle here in in this middle part and that's and that quote under the bloodline is there was seed in here you know like this didn't go so well in here can you know compared to here with the full word and here with the full word but there was many seed that had to be redeemed in that time and brought brought into the into the kingdom and it got ready for getting ready for a resurrection and they will come up in the resurrection and there will be people there will be people there because and I was going to go into Revelation 25 won't get time but there is the wise version in the foolish virgin and it calls the foolish virgin righteous because they were seed but they didn't go onto the Holy Ghost but in the end you see they all fell asleep and then in the last time the word was revealed again to a prophet and they were they woke and those hair had had the oil they had the full loyal they had the the The Giver he was he was in there and the others wanted to give her but you can't give part of that to them you know they didn't have it it had leaked out they didn't have it they didn't come to the Holy Ghost and it was no different from what Berta Brennan says in terms of you know a cloth like a cloth hair and someone was going in sewing and they cut out a piece and the rest is the remnant which is the foolish virgin and they go into into the darkness which is tribulation in the last day is not is not a hell or anything like it's a tribulation that they had to go through and come up in the second resurrection but this part in here they go into the first resurrection which is the rapture and show up here in the second resurrection in Revelation 20 and there on the throne would with Christ here and the wise were the foolish virgins is here before the throne and they will be granted eternal life but they were these ones weren't in the mind of God at the beginning only these were and they they they don't go through any tribulation because they took it at Calvary and they they are here under throne with Christ in the second resurrection and that's that's when all of this is judged and all their foolish virgins because they are righteous if you read 25 it says the righteous and it goes on and says what they did you know that gave him that gave him this eternal life in the end it was granted to him they didn't have that Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost at the end the baptism of the Holy Ghost so here here now so where were we're seeing that there's two ages that really come together but in between that there was a whole time when these he had to follow the bloodline and bring these people out and had them you know come into the Holy Ghost for a resurrection at the end so so brother Brian had to deal he in in this in in when the seals came along I'm kind of touched a whole lot of things here sorry if it's a little bit quick here but he talks about the abstract title deed and he he had to deal with the breach that was here in this time because because what was made over here was lost so now there is had to be a way for them to come into and into the fullness of the Holy Ghost and he talks about a title deed so you could be a Christian you have a title of Christian but in all the truth of this ages he said they really just had a title they didn't have the abstract and the abstract is a u.s. thing is not Canadian in British parliamentary system but the if you you could have a title to something but say if it was land but you could still lose it you know it's possible that you could lose it so now in the case say Indians who own to that land in North America could file a suit and go back and search it back and you realize the land you thought you owned and your parents your grandparents the Indians come along and take it because they had they had a right to it back then Israel says the same thing about Israel right they have a they have ownership of that right back to the beginning so but in this age where Brent said that there was an abstract he talks about it many times and I have to I have to quote here I have it up here and I'll get to it but it talks about that in the abstract it would it gets cleared right back to the beginning right back to God so the one who's there in the Garden of Eden like they lost that they lost the the title deed Adam and Eve did from what they did and went back to God so now every part for you for every individual because not about churches hears about individuals they could be that they could be wiped out all of what was done right back to the beginning to God every one of your ancestors whatever trait you have that you brought through some Grandpere is all gone you were clean right back to the beginning so you now you have the aunts rank title deed and the abstract is the Holy Ghost he says that's what you get and what it what it what it brought was was the the sea of forgetfulness so every bit of that that was right back right from the beginning was put into the sea of forgetfulness and no one can claim anything to your inheritance right back to the beginning and that's what he talked about in the abstract title D and I got some quotes there on it so that was a gulf that was a gulf that was a chasm that was there that no one could cross into until in the last stage when the full Holy Ghost came and the abstract came so that could be cleared and now you got to see a forgetfulness and everything is put into the sea of forgetfulness and there's no one the devil can never make a claim on anything you did or your grandfather did or your great-grandfather or whatever it was all cleared right back and that's the difference between an abstract and a title deed it was never a rape brought right back to the beginning of time so in this case then it was we we saw this the seals were broken and then there was an indictment where they rejected it just and the word was crucified and then there was a token and an exodus took place and after an exodus then of course the rest go into a tribulation just like in the other ages where there was a exit so right here so John talking from the breach between the seven Church ages and his seven seals John hadn't noticed this land before you know he hadn't mentioned before now nowhere had it been mentioned John didn't see it all over the heavens see revelation five was so important to us because it happened in our time it was all manifested in our time it's all over the heavens as he's looking but here is here it come forth where did it come from it came from the Father's throne where he was seated since he had been slain and raised again he raised up and said on the right hand of the God right hand of God ever living to make intercession 'he's raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people all those ages reign his own people his bloodline right now now oh that's the one I'm depending on he still was covered with the bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sin now oh my said now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner Almighty God the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original owner God himself he explains that a number of times we're going to find it in just a minute there he sits on the throne with it with it in his hands the title deed and he said that makes me feel religious friends a title deed to eternal life abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam forfeited for wisdom and instead of faith it when back to the hands of the owner Almighty God what a great thing what's it doing in the hands of God waiting for the redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see where we're sitting to now we'll watch this fellow sitting upon the throne all right and this is what happened is is that he was called from eternity from an intercessor role and now he comes as a as a judge he's starting to come now as a judge and he takes that book and he opens the book and he calls his bride in our age and that's where we're sitting today waiting for the redemption claims it's redemption what is this book of redemption this title deed this abstract title deed you say abstract what does abstract mean it means it's searched all the way back to its beginning so everything is searched means is that it's cleared it's clear buried back to the beginning like the little drop of ink that now he's acquaintance at to to see if forgetfulness and that ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when the sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ it gives an abstract right straight back to the creator again and you become a son of God abstract title deed is held in the hand of Almighty they never had the abstract to eat only back in the first age in that first Bride period that they had the abstract deep and they lost they lost him it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my what ought that to do to a born-again Christian it's legal possession of the abstract the title deed of eternal life means that you persist you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost no one can take it away from you what of it brethren the possession of that deed Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he lost it he had sinned and he separated himself from God and was on the side of the chasm so he could not redeem it he just couldn't do it he needed to redemption himself so he could not do it amen from the token now the attorney this alludes to this indeed token now the attorney may think that he was all but down but you see who is a judge who is a judge is going to decide the case whether the attorney can make it clear or whether to him that you're justified in your deed so he's now taken as this abstract title deed is being done by him and he's the judge and the attorney in 68 paragraph 68 Oh God if the people could only see this our judges our attorney the case is settled it's all over the same one as judge is the attorney is our attorney the case is settled we have the token both judge and journey that's the abstract both judge and journey is the same person when God was made flesh and dwelt among us our judge became our attorney and the case is settled and the Holy Ghost is here for a token that were ready to pass from here into the lands beyond amen bring us to I'm just down to 32 to 132 to save time you might say I believe it I believe it I believe it's the truth I accept it as the truth then that's all good but it has to be applied it has to be deployed just like in the first Exodus it goes on the doorpost it Sun display and we'll talk about that in a minute there's a good quote on the abstract getting to the end of the abstract here like the Pentecostal experience today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in the last days this promise is like the abstract to a title deed now you you can get a title Shore you can get a title to a place but that still don't say it's yours no sir somebody way back yonder could come in and put a claim on it like I said but when you get an abstract that shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off plumb back from the foundation right from the beginning it's all struck if it's abstract and when a man has said that he believes to word and then when the Holy Ghost comes it's the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract that every bit of that belongs to you and everything is on on it belongs to you and that gives us the abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw back yonder for the found of the world and put it name and put its name on the book of life but was born through a man and a woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin is the whole plan of God there but when he I believe believed on it I received the deed but then the Holy Ghost come it was the abstract so when he believed he said I believe you got a title you can call yourself Christian it's just like you would a Jew you'd be circumcised and you can be a Jew doesn't mean you got to you know your you got to covenant you know you still got to be under the Covenant and here it's saying you can believe and you got a title but you now you need the abstract title deed to go right back to the beginning and that's what the Holy Ghost brings it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandfather done it it doesn't matter so we see here so sober Bram says he says that numerous times in the token he says what does it got to be to be on display and he says the blood of Jesus Christ which is he says what does it mean that the token has to be on display in my life and the blood of Jesus Christ which is in your soul has to be witnessed on the outside and your whole life is a testimony you're actually the scripture you get yourself under way he comes in and uses that vessel it's not you and him is just him the blood is applied and the blood is speaking you become a living Oracle they are the people that the Bible says that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophets there will be a bride a spotless chastened virgin and she will be the very image of Almighty God and in this message he says there there will be a bride and she will be made the same thing and clothing the same thing that the one was at the beginning she is to be called so you don't it the the thing on display is that that blood living in you that life living in you the full life manifested getting to the end here I think we come to that spot we've come to Katie's Barnea when God has given the issue of the church to call a halt and back to prayer this is this is this is what he's saying now that the believers do these believers do who had that abstract title deed and and this church when God has given the issue for the church to call a halt and back to prayer life back to a consecration these are the ancient landmarks now he's laying right these are our ancient landmarks that we have to stay with he says the back to prayer life back to consecration back to a spot where we concentrate ourselves away from the things of the world and away from our little petty differences among us and go back to God and brotherly love and humility back to the power of God again we're just for sumin when we're running all right because God is blessing he was blessing Israel be probably the same day that they refused to go up there to the promised land talking about kgs Barnea and he said that day when they refused to go to promised land nice it's the same day that they they disbelieved despise the manna fell just the same that night but they were all together out of the will of God he's preaching presuming right he's saying don't presume because you might be getting the blessings of God here and that's what Pentecost is probably they think they're getting the blessings of God but they're right out of the will of God but God still goes with the blessing and in the in the case of Katies Bernier they were still getting the manna fall that same day that they refused to go into the promised land the man who was still fallen right they could not win another battle until they come back and made things right with God so it has to be the word on the word you know it's not the blessings it's a word because when God gets who God gives doc the gifts to the Holy Ghost of Pentecost he never takes him away he never took justification away from the from the Lutheran's they never took sanctification away from the Methodists they still have it you know if you want to partake of it you can it's still there you're still but God moves on right there's no one gonna be born again if there's more revealed in another age so when the word is revealed Pentecost not going to receive the Holy Ghost it's not going to happen it won't happen because they need to move on to the next next thing that work where the light is first John first John 1:7 you know we'll walk in the light as he is in the light you know do you have to be in that light in order to receive the fellowship with God right that's it right through all the angels and okay whoa where'd that come from so I guess that's the end of it what I got here I don't follow notes real good you know that right so so there we are it's just it I've touched on a bunch of things there going through the the Exodus - when Exodus three and there's a lot of detail around that but I just wanted to give it kind of a high high because I was I I was kind of taken there with the abstract and the title deed and what was required in this age but mostly what was to us different you know in Luther's days in Wesley's day when they say they they had the Holy Ghost but they didn't have to token you don't forget it as what was given in this day and try to help us understand that a little more that it is to give her it is to forward its Holy Ghost because he is the word he was main question that the Word was with God the Word was God and and the word became flesh so he is the word you know and the Holy Ghost is to work you know and then and then this age the abstract is the Holy Ghost and in this age we it brought what bur Brian talked about many times to see if forgetfulness and and and these these sins that have been in and go right back have all been put into the sea of forgetfulness and uh and lost forever he's talked about to die and it puts in a vat of job X and it just the camera is gone it's completely evaporated in that in that mixture and that's what's happened with us today and that all happened in revelation 5 that all happened in 63 when you know when Jesus came on the scene again came out of eternity and went and took that book and started to call his bride then at that time right and and not that the names were on the book but you know they would recognize they were underneath that and they could recognize the word for their for their day and not an under day but this day so why did you come to it you know you wonder why back then and you know it's being revealed more and more as we go on that is all god and it certainly gives you an assurance an arrest you know that you know he's he's here to bring us you know into a rapture and his the ones that are bit he'll not you know not forsake one there would be there not be one that won't be there in that age and and thank God for that amen let's stand and musicians can come on and we'll
