[53:39] bless you this morning you may be seated
[53:41] and then just call me jeremiah this
[53:42] morning amen
[53:44] amen i want to
[53:45] continue this morning on this little
[53:47] series on authority to believe and this
[53:49] is really a carryover from the last
[53:50] service but i want to preach this
[53:52] morning on when nothing seems to be
[53:54] happening
[53:55] amen we've uh
[53:56] just praying about different things over
[53:58] the last while and certainly over the
[54:00] last week and
[54:02] i saw it dropped in my heart of what do
[54:03] we do when we've prayed and we've done
[54:05] our part and we've done everything we
[54:06] can and we've we've confessed and we've
[54:08] believed and we've testified and yet
[54:10] nothing seems to be happening in our
[54:12] lives amen that the things that we've
[54:14] we've prayed about the things that we've
[54:15] expressed the desires that are in our
[54:17] heart they're there and we believe
[54:18] they're of god and yet nothing seems to
[54:20] be happening to them amen and we've
[54:22] spoken so many times of the promises of
[54:24] god and how we're the children of
[54:25] promise and we're the children of
[54:27] prophecy and we're the children of the
[54:28] fulfilled word and all these different
[54:30] things and yet the actual fulfillment of
[54:33] those things in our lives often looks so
[54:34] much different than what we read on the
[54:36] pages amen we have a theory we have an
[54:38] idea a picture in our mind of how these
[54:40] things are going to happen as we we take
[54:42] them when we put them into our lives and
[54:44] yet we find that the reality of the
[54:45] situation rarely matches the theory we
[54:47] have in our minds amen i can see that as
[54:49] a man as a father as a minister many
[54:52] things we think well it's just going to
[54:53] be this and it's going to be
[54:54] straightforward and guess what it's
[54:55] straightforward to god but usually it's
[54:57] a little bit of a crooked path for the
[54:58] believer because they're trying to find
[55:00] their way and there's so much that's
[55:01] going on in our lives amen and there's
[55:03] times where god is beautifully sovereign
[55:05] and he gives us the desire of our heart
[55:07] more or less right when we ask it you
[55:09] know whether you're you're looking for a
[55:10] provision you know talking to brother
[55:11] joe the other day he says you know and
[55:13] i've i prayed and i've confessed to god
[55:14] and two hours later the phone rang and i
[55:16] had all the business i needed to get us
[55:18] through a low point or something like
[55:20] that and god does that sometimes we've
[55:22] seen it in healing my wife you know when
[55:23] she when brother joe adams prayed for
[55:25] her way back many years in dallas and he
[55:27] prayed for her gallbladder trouble and
[55:28] she was just healed immediately and
[55:30] selena was healed of lactose intolerance
[55:31] sometimes god is so sovereign in those
[55:33] things amen but guess what there are
[55:35] other times where god is so sovereign
[55:37] where he makes us wait and the
[55:38] sovereignty of god is no different when
[55:40] he gives it to us immediately than when
[55:41] he makes us wait amen that's the
[55:43] sovereignty of god is that it's his time
[55:46] that really matters the most amen we
[55:47] want it quickly we're we're human it's
[55:49] human to want things quickly and then
[55:51] it's a it's a it's a time of instant
[55:53] gratification that's right right we
[55:54] don't have to wait for anything we have
[55:56] our phones we have communication we have
[55:58] the ability to travel at 100 kilometers
[56:00] an hour or faster if we want everywhere
[56:02] we go everything can be instant we can
[56:04] we can put food in the microwave and two
[56:06] minutes later it goes from frozen to
[56:07] fully prepared and we can eat it you
[56:09] know in these different things but god
[56:11] doesn't work that way and i'm thankful
[56:12] he doesn't because he's doing a bigger
[56:14] work than just giving us what we ask for
[56:16] amen he's giving us what he promised is
[56:18] really what he's working on and so it's
[56:19] not just the promises of god but it's
[56:21] the character of god that he's building
[56:22] into our lives each one
[56:25] that's so it's a well-known quote but i
[56:26] want to use it to set the tone this
[56:28] morning brother bam says and why does
[56:30] god let troubles come
[56:32] sometimes the trouble is the prayer is
[56:34] not being answered
[56:36] it's not just things are difficult but
[56:37] it's that things are dragging out it's
[56:39] that there doesn't seem to be an end in
[56:41] sight he says why does god let troubles
[56:42] come he says god harnesses trouble
[56:46] puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey
[56:49] him and those troubles bring us into a
[56:52] closer fellowship with god
[56:54] so i want to say this morning if you've
[56:56] been facing a lot of troubles then god
[56:58] is in the situation amen god is working
[57:00] in your life as we've heard brother joe
[57:03] adams preached so much on it where he
[57:05] said that if god has allowed something
[57:07] into your life then remember he's
[57:08] allowed it because god has you inside of
[57:10] a fortress and if he opens the door to
[57:12] let the enemy in then he had to do it
[57:14] with purpose because he doesn't open the
[57:16] door to let the enemy in for no reason
[57:18] but he's laying it in and brother brown
[57:19] says he puts bits in its mouth and a bit
[57:22] in a is used in a horse's mouth and it's
[57:24] tied to the reins and the halt or the
[57:25] rains and it goes in the mouth so that
[57:27] when you pull on the reins you pull the
[57:29] head and where the head goes the body
[57:31] will go hey man it's really hard to go
[57:33] straight when your head's turned to the
[57:34] right isn't it so he says he takes
[57:36] trouble and he controls it and then he's
[57:38] got it in his hands he's got it in his
[57:40] control so whatever the situation is god
[57:43] has the reins
[57:45] so if he's allowed it in he's only going
[57:46] to let it go so far like he did in the
[57:48] life of job he said you can touch his
[57:50] wealth but you can't touch him amen and
[57:53] so he took all of his wealth but he
[57:54] didn't touch his body then he said but
[57:56] if you let me touch his body then he'll
[57:58] curse you says all right touch his body
[58:00] but you can't take his life and so he
[58:02] touched his body but he could never take
[58:03] his life why god was in control god
[58:06] limits satan it's amazing that satan
[58:08] thinks he can get anything done when
[58:09] god's got the reigns on him the entire
[58:11] time amen you'd think he'd figure it out
[58:13] by now that he can only go as far as god
[58:15] will let him but brother brahm says he's
[58:17] working in your troubles to what bring
[58:19] you into closer fellowship with god i so
[58:22] love what brother joseph he says god
[58:23] will start a fire and put you in it to
[58:25] have a conversation with you i mean
[58:27] that's a tremendous revelation for the
[58:29] believers that if he takes you into the
[58:30] fire he's there to have a conversation
[58:32] with you amen
[58:34] amen but job's situation is quite
[58:36] different in that god was proving him
[58:39] god said have you have you considered my
[58:41] servant job he was proving to satan the
[58:44] character and the commitment of job to
[58:46] his walk with god amen but so many times
[58:48] with us it's not about our commitment as
[58:50] it is our commitment to the word it's
[58:52] our belief in the word it's the test of
[58:53] our faith really jobs wasn't a test of
[58:55] faith it was a test of did he trust god
[58:57] amen did his situation determine how
[59:00] good of a christian he was right whether
[59:02] the money was in the bank whether he was
[59:04] lying flat on his back sick or whether
[59:05] he was healthy and hail it didn't matter
[59:07] to job his relationship with god stayed
[59:10] the same he says god gives god takes
[59:12] away blessed be the name of the lord
[59:14] amen but i want to just give you some
[59:16] spiritual vitamins this morning some
[59:17] scriptural vitamins just as we start
[59:19] into this this morning to try and try
[59:21] and and again set this tone here
[59:23] proverbs 18 10 says the name of the lord
[59:26] is a strong tower the righteous runneth
[59:28] into it and is safe glory amen if you're
[59:31] mrs jesus christ this morning then you
[59:33] have his name as a strong tower
[59:35] psalms 37 says the lord knoweth the days
[59:38] of the upright and their inheritance
[59:40] shall be forever
[59:42] they shall not be ashamed in the evil
[59:44] time and in the days of famine they
[59:47] shall be satisfied
[59:49] don't leave when things get tight
[59:51] don't leave when things get dry amen
[59:53] because why there's a promise coming at
[59:55] the end of rain amen there's a promise
[59:57] coming at the end that your fruit will
[59:58] be there and that your inheritance will
[1:00:00] be there and that you'll be able to reap
[1:00:02] what you've sowed those many years ago
[1:00:05] psalms 25 says unto thee o lord do i
[1:00:07] lift up my soul
[1:00:09] o my god i trust in thee let me not be
[1:00:12] ashamed let not mine enemies triumph
[1:00:14] over me yea let none that wait on thee
[1:00:17] be ashamed let them be ashamed which
[1:00:19] transgressed thy cause
[1:00:21] what that those again that go against
[1:00:23] your will
[1:00:24] let them be ashamed but don't let me be
[1:00:26] ashamed lord because i'm seeking your
[1:00:27] will and i'm trusting that i'm walking
[1:00:29] in it
[1:00:30] show me thy ways o lord teach me thy
[1:00:32] past lead me in thy truth and teach me
[1:00:35] for thou art the god of my salvation on
[1:00:38] thee do i wait all the day
[1:00:41] psalms 119 says uphold me according unto
[1:00:44] thy word that i may live
[1:00:48] you've got to ask for life the way his
[1:00:49] word says you're supposed to live amen
[1:00:51] he can't uphold you if you won't hold to
[1:00:53] his word but but in here david says
[1:00:56] uphold me according to thy word that i
[1:00:57] may live and let me not be ashamed of my
[1:01:00] hope
[1:01:01] hold thou me up and i shall be safe and
[1:01:03] i will have respect unto thy statutes
[1:01:06] continually
[1:01:08] romans 5 paul says therefore being
[1:01:10] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:01:12] god through our lord jesus christ by
[1:01:14] whom also we have access by faith unto
[1:01:17] this grace wherein we stand
[1:01:20] and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[1:01:23] and not only soul but we glory in
[1:01:25] tribulations also knowing that
[1:01:27] tribulation worketh patience patience
[1:01:30] experience and experience hope
[1:01:33] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[1:01:36] love of god is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:01:38] by the holy ghost which is given to us
[1:01:40] if you have the holy ghost in your heart
[1:01:42] you have everything you'll ever need you
[1:01:44] are signed sealed and delivered and even
[1:01:45] though it doesn't look like it all the
[1:01:47] time there is no doubt about the end uh
[1:01:49] the end goal for you amen amen i wanted
[1:01:52] to read those scriptures and it's only a
[1:01:54] handful we could sit here for hours and
[1:01:56] read of the goodness and promises of god
[1:01:58] that he guaranteed a place of refuge a
[1:02:00] place of
[1:02:01] of a reality with him
[1:02:03] in the word amen amen but we're all
[1:02:05] called out people and i believe we're
[1:02:07] getting ready to go
[1:02:08] and man i believe we're getting ready to
[1:02:10] go out of this whole world amen and our
[1:02:11] hearts want to go amen our hearts want
[1:02:13] to go but guess what these bodies are
[1:02:15] sitting here and guess what they like
[1:02:17] this whole world they like this old
[1:02:18] flesh they like the way of these things
[1:02:20] and we're coming to a place where we've
[1:02:21] got to get that that body that carnal
[1:02:23] nature so under submission that we would
[1:02:26] want to go out of here with everything
[1:02:27] that's in us and that the body and the
[1:02:29] carnal nature would have no influence on
[1:02:31] us amen that the holy spirit would just
[1:02:32] have free reign in our lives in every
[1:02:34] aspect that when satan comes in and he
[1:02:36] knocks on the door we don't even answer
[1:02:38] the door anymore amen that he has no
[1:02:40] inroads into our life amen that he is so
[1:02:42] completely sealed out that he's got no
[1:02:45] avenue into our life amen
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:48] remember we're called to take hold of
[1:02:50] the promises of god he doesn't give them
[1:02:52] so that nobody will take him he doesn't
[1:02:53] give them to hang us out to dry but he
[1:02:55] gives them to us for a purpose and it's
[1:02:57] that they would do good in our lives
[1:02:58] amen
[1:02:59] the brother brown would say but to me
[1:03:01] every word every action has to come from
[1:03:04] this bible it has to be god's word and
[1:03:06] then i know it's true if god the bible
[1:03:09] backs it up and says it's true with the
[1:03:11] promise then it's the truth
[1:03:13] it's somebody that's found faith that
[1:03:14] stands there on that word and makes it
[1:03:16] live again jesus christ the same
[1:03:18] yesterday today and forever when we see
[1:03:21] that in the promise of god then we can
[1:03:23] be perseverant we can really believe and
[1:03:25] stay there because it's god's promise
[1:03:27] stay right with it no matter how long it
[1:03:30] takes it'll bring it out
[1:03:32] now that tells me that it's not always
[1:03:34] going to be quick
[1:03:35] no i can i don't need to hear the
[1:03:36] prophet say that i know my in my own
[1:03:38] life it's not always going to be quick
[1:03:39] in fact the majority of the time it's
[1:03:41] not going to be quick
[1:03:42] amen but he says stay right with it no
[1:03:46] matter how long it takes it'll bring it
[1:03:48] out and we look at the situation
[1:03:49] sometimes well nothing's changing and
[1:03:51] then what we do is we put it back on
[1:03:53] ourselves and we say well that must mean
[1:03:54] that i lack faith
[1:03:56] if nothing's going on then the problem
[1:03:57] must be with me amen don't jump to that
[1:04:00] conclusion right off the bat because i
[1:04:01] guarantee you no matter what you do
[1:04:03] satan's going to say you're the problem
[1:04:05] and guess what the issue is not you amen
[1:04:08] satan wants to think that you're the
[1:04:09] limiting factor every single time and
[1:04:11] the simple fact is you are the limiting
[1:04:13] factor but you're not trusting in
[1:04:15] yourself you're trusting in the words so
[1:04:16] why does it matter what you think or do
[1:04:19] amen god's looking to your faith and not
[1:04:21] what you can do or what you won't do but
[1:04:23] he's looking to will they stand on the
[1:04:25] promise and will they stay there until i
[1:04:26] bring it into their life amen god does
[1:04:28] all things well and as we said he's got
[1:04:30] all things under his control
[1:04:32] now brother branham we're talking about
[1:04:33] the idea well maybe i don't have faith
[1:04:35] and that's why nothing's happening now
[1:04:36] brother adam had this family reach out
[1:04:38] to him and i believe it was all the way
[1:04:39] over in germany they had a flight ready
[1:04:41] to fly him over their baby died
[1:04:43] and they called brother brown and they
[1:04:44] said brother branham we know that you
[1:04:46] can breeze this baby from the dead
[1:04:49] so they said will you come over we've
[1:04:51] got a military flight we've got it
[1:04:52] chartered ready to bring you over we'll
[1:04:54] fly over to germany we won't let him do
[1:04:55] anything to the baby until you come you
[1:04:57] can lay hands on it raise it from the
[1:04:58] dead okay
[1:05:00] listen to this he says him one morning
[1:05:02] about daylight i got up and the wife
[1:05:04] went out of the room she went out of the
[1:05:05] room i just woke up and laying there a
[1:05:07] little bit directly i heard something
[1:05:09] come in the room and i looked there was
[1:05:11] something moving in the room and i
[1:05:13] jumped up and i said lord what would you
[1:05:14] have your servant know
[1:05:16] he said do not rebuke that that's the
[1:05:19] hand of the lord see so i got her on the
[1:05:21] phone i said no god has called your baby
[1:05:25] and so when she come over to us that
[1:05:26] night left her at the house when i left
[1:05:28] yesterday she said what was it brother
[1:05:30] branham my weakness of faith
[1:05:33] i said you have great faith you prayed
[1:05:36] for your baby and you and your husband
[1:05:38] held on to it
[1:05:39] to god to raise that baby and he refused
[1:05:43] to do it because he knows what's best
[1:05:46] and still you love him
[1:05:49] that's real faith
[1:05:51] why because god didn't promise to raise
[1:05:53] us all from the dead when we died
[1:05:55] but she said i have faith to believe he
[1:05:57] can do it
[1:05:58] and he will do it and she goes to the
[1:06:00] prophet and he goes to god and god says
[1:06:03] no i'm in it don't call that baby back
[1:06:06] to life and she says well what was it me
[1:06:08] was it me he says no you got great faith
[1:06:10] you prayed and you held on and you still
[1:06:12] love god even though he's telling you no
[1:06:14] right now
[1:06:15] he says anybody when mountains are
[1:06:18] moving and things can have faith but let
[1:06:20] it go backwards one time and see how it
[1:06:23] works that's when you prove whether
[1:06:25] you've got faith or not
[1:06:27] amen when things are going great and
[1:06:28] everything's rolling forward and
[1:06:30] smoothly and there's no hindrance we all
[1:06:31] have faith
[1:06:33] but let the symptoms worsen one time
[1:06:35] right let the money go
[1:06:37] even more out of your bank account go
[1:06:39] into the negative go into your overdraft
[1:06:41] and then let your child get even further
[1:06:43] out in the world
[1:06:45] right let somebody leave the church
[1:06:47] whatever it might be and you say
[1:06:50] whoa
[1:06:52] what's up
[1:06:53] do i lack faith
[1:06:56] he says no you've got to make sure
[1:06:58] you've got faith when things don't look
[1:06:59] so good not just when they haven't
[1:07:01] changed but when they've gone backwards
[1:07:04] right when you've gone backwards
[1:07:06] stay there
[1:07:07] stay there
[1:07:09] he says every son that cometh to god
[1:07:11] must be chastened and tried of god so
[1:07:12] remember our trials work patience and
[1:07:15] patient works hope and so forth so we
[1:07:17] just hold on to god whether he blesses
[1:07:20] us or not
[1:07:21] we are right there believing him anyhow
[1:07:24] because he promised it amen if he
[1:07:27] promises we believe and if he never made
[1:07:29] a promise then we go with whatever his
[1:07:31] decision is and we're happy with his
[1:07:34] decision amen
[1:07:35] noah's how it's tied together faith is
[1:07:37] often not the limiting factor but rather
[1:07:40] god's trying to do something in the
[1:07:42] situation
[1:07:44] so you got to see that there's often a
[1:07:45] different purpose or maybe multiple
[1:07:47] purposes in the trial or tribulation or
[1:07:49] issue or or health issue family issue
[1:07:51] whatever it is there's a there's
[1:07:53] something else going on and you got to
[1:07:55] be able to step back and say all right
[1:07:57] i'm going to have patience in the
[1:07:58] situation i'm going to trust him no
[1:08:00] matter what because god is moving here
[1:08:02] and even though i can't see what he's
[1:08:03] doing
[1:08:04] i'll stay here amen and brother braham
[1:08:07] says what the proof of your faith is
[1:08:08] that you keep believing and praising
[1:08:10] regardless as if nothing changes or it
[1:08:13] goes backwards even
[1:08:14] that's the proof of your faith is that
[1:08:16] you hold on and you keep believing and
[1:08:17] your love to god doesn't change even
[1:08:19] though you don't get what you're looking
[1:08:20] for
[1:08:21] right now we remember this story of
[1:08:23] elisha and the great shunamite woman
[1:08:24] remember and remember she went to her
[1:08:26] husband she said this is a man of god
[1:08:28] and maybe we could build a little room
[1:08:29] for him to stay in when he comes here
[1:08:31] and they did it and then elisha comes in
[1:08:33] he says to his servant you know what can
[1:08:35] we give them he says well they have
[1:08:37] everything they need but they don't have
[1:08:38] a son
[1:08:39] so he went to the woman he says god's
[1:08:41] going to give you something she said hey
[1:08:42] don't don't fool around with me with
[1:08:44] this i've wanted a son for so long don't
[1:08:46] just say those things to me and he says
[1:08:48] thus saith the lord you'll have a son
[1:08:50] and she has a son and he's a child of
[1:08:53] promise
[1:08:54] he's a miracle baby
[1:08:56] and then he goes out and he's still a
[1:08:58] young boy and he goes out with his
[1:08:59] father in the harvest and he gets sun
[1:09:01] stroke of some sort and he falls over
[1:09:03] and faints and then they bring him in
[1:09:05] and he dies
[1:09:06] the child of promise dies
[1:09:09] that's a special kind of torture
[1:09:11] especially for a faithful believer the
[1:09:13] child of promise is lying dead
[1:09:16] and then she what they take them and
[1:09:17] they lay them in on the prophet's bed
[1:09:19] and she tells her husband she says i'm
[1:09:21] going to get i'm going to the prophet
[1:09:23] and he says take her and she tells a
[1:09:25] servant she says we're going to ride
[1:09:27] and don't stop for nothing
[1:09:30] i don't care if anybody stops and wants
[1:09:32] to talk everybody wonders what's going
[1:09:34] on don't stop for anything she says
[1:09:36] don't stop unless i tell you to stop she
[1:09:38] didn't say stop if i fall off she says
[1:09:41] don't stop unless i tell you stop we're
[1:09:43] going until we get to the prophet of god
[1:09:45] and when we get there we're going to
[1:09:46] sort this thing out amen and when she
[1:09:49] comes up then the prophet of god sees
[1:09:51] her from a distance
[1:09:53] i want you to catch this and so he sends
[1:09:55] his servant he says go and check if
[1:09:57] everything's right
[1:09:59] she's driving crazy
[1:10:01] go and make sure everything's all right
[1:10:02] and she comes up to hazy and gahazie
[1:10:05] says is all well and she says what
[1:10:08] it is well
[1:10:11] the child of promise is laying dead at
[1:10:13] her house and she says it is well
[1:10:16] that's faith
[1:10:18] that's faith
[1:10:19] it is well though everything seems lost
[1:10:21] it is well
[1:10:23] but when she got up to that prophet she
[1:10:24] got down on his feet and she grabbed on
[1:10:26] and he says okay something's wrong here
[1:10:28] her testimony is it as well but her
[1:10:31] expression says there's a there's a need
[1:10:33] here
[1:10:34] and he says god's hidden this from me
[1:10:35] tell me what's going on
[1:10:37] she tells him and he says all right and
[1:10:39] we'll read it here in second kings four
[1:10:41] he says then said he took a hazel gird
[1:10:43] up thy loins and take my staff in thine
[1:10:45] hand and go thy way if thou meet any man
[1:10:48] salute him not and if any salute thee
[1:10:50] answer him not again and lay my staff
[1:10:52] upon the face of the child
[1:10:53] and the mother of the child said as the
[1:10:55] lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i
[1:10:57] will not leave thee and he arose and
[1:10:59] followed her and gahazi passed on before
[1:11:02] them and laid the staff upon the face of
[1:11:03] the child but there was neither voice
[1:11:05] nor hearing wherefore when he went again
[1:11:08] to meet him and told him saying the
[1:11:09] child is not awakened
[1:11:11] gehazi wasn't a prophet
[1:11:13] gehesie had no anointing to do that work
[1:11:15] that was not his place or his position
[1:11:18] but he obeyed the prophet anyways and
[1:11:20] nothing happened
[1:11:22] and when elisha came into the house was
[1:11:25] coming to the house behold the child was
[1:11:26] dead and laid upon his bed and he went
[1:11:29] in there for and shut the door upon them
[1:11:30] twain and prayed unto the lord now catch
[1:11:33] the sequence here right because we're
[1:11:34] talking about when nothing seems to be
[1:11:36] happening and elisha goes and he prays
[1:11:38] and then he goes into action verse 34
[1:11:41] says and he went up and lay upon the
[1:11:42] child and put his mouth upon his mouth
[1:11:44] his eyes upon his eyes his hands upon
[1:11:46] his hands and stretched himself upon the
[1:11:48] child and the flesh of the child wax
[1:11:50] warm
[1:11:52] now listen this is the basic laws of
[1:11:54] thermodynamics you put something warm on
[1:11:56] something cold then that thing cold is
[1:11:57] going to get warmed up
[1:11:59] so all this boy is doing is warming up
[1:12:01] with the prophet's presence
[1:12:02] he's not alive he's death warmed over is
[1:12:05] all he is right now
[1:12:06] as he lays on there that man's heat goes
[1:12:08] into that boy's body and he warms him up
[1:12:11] but nothing else happens amen
[1:12:13] he's prayed
[1:12:14] over the child of promise that is dead
[1:12:17] and he lays himself on there and nothing
[1:12:18] happens
[1:12:20] now watch this
[1:12:23] then he returned and walked in the house
[1:12:25] to and fro
[1:12:28] he spent some time there
[1:12:31] back and forth what was he doing making
[1:12:33] sure that he was supposed to do what he
[1:12:34] was doing checking in with god
[1:12:38] and then
[1:12:39] he went in and stretched himself upon
[1:12:41] him and the child sneezed seven times
[1:12:43] and the child opened his eyes and he
[1:12:45] called gehazi and said call the
[1:12:47] shunammite so he called her and when she
[1:12:49] was coming to him he said take up thy
[1:12:51] son
[1:12:52] and she went in and fell at his feet and
[1:12:54] bowed herself to the ground and took up
[1:12:56] her son and went out listen even
[1:12:58] prophets don't always get answered on
[1:13:00] the first try
[1:13:01] and then he goes there she's a child of
[1:13:03] promise amen that was not the child of
[1:13:05] elisha's promise that was thus saith the
[1:13:07] lord promised that was god speaking
[1:13:09] through a prophet and that woman
[1:13:11] believed that if she could get to that
[1:13:12] man that man would touch god and god
[1:13:13] would bring him back to life amen but
[1:13:15] even that prophet in his permit position
[1:13:19] with his commission did not get an
[1:13:20] answer on the first try
[1:13:22] he had to stay there and he had to check
[1:13:25] up and he had to make sure and then he
[1:13:27] went and did it again and then that boy
[1:13:28] came to life that's what it took him and
[1:13:30] if you read in brother brown's life
[1:13:31] story there's many times where he's up
[1:13:33] on the platform and people are healed
[1:13:35] just like that right and you can hear
[1:13:37] whether it's the boy that was crippled
[1:13:39] and he walks off and as soon as he walks
[1:13:40] off the edge of the platform burban says
[1:13:42] there he is and the whole place erupts
[1:13:45] he's got those he had the the the baby
[1:13:47] with the the blind he had no eyes
[1:13:50] and they came in it formed in his
[1:13:52] sockets on the platform just like that
[1:13:55] the creative spoken word happening right
[1:13:57] there in front of them but there are
[1:13:59] times where brother brown stayed up on
[1:14:00] that platform with one person for two
[1:14:04] hours straight and nothing happening
[1:14:07] nothing happening i've got a quote
[1:14:08] that's about this long where he's
[1:14:09] talking to his sister and he's showing
[1:14:11] her so she can see he's got the
[1:14:12] discernment but he's got the hand there
[1:14:14] and he's showing her all the bumps in
[1:14:15] that and he says you know what here and
[1:14:16] we're going to pray then she says he
[1:14:18] says are they gone
[1:14:19] she says no and he says no i know i
[1:14:20] don't even have to look he says i can
[1:14:22] feel it's still there then he prays
[1:14:23] again are they gone no then he prays
[1:14:26] again and she says well it's the the
[1:14:28] bumps are gone but the swelling's still
[1:14:29] there
[1:14:31] and then the swelling goes away and he
[1:14:32] says now you're healed he had to go
[1:14:33] three or four times before that thing
[1:14:35] left her
[1:14:36] why he had to be persistent he had to
[1:14:38] believe that god had called him to do
[1:14:40] that amen and because he knew god had
[1:14:42] called them he didn't care whether it
[1:14:43] took one minute or whether it took one
[1:14:45] or two hours he was going to stay there
[1:14:47] until satan's kingdom was shaken amen
[1:14:49] until god fulfilled his word in his
[1:14:51] ministry for the people that he had sent
[1:14:53] him to pray for god had sent him to pray
[1:14:55] he got a a supernatural commission to go
[1:14:57] and pray for the people and he in that
[1:14:59] commission he would stay there until
[1:15:01] something happened or god told him what
[1:15:03] was going on that's right amen that's
[1:15:05] the kind of faith we're talking about
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:08] amen you've got to know that you're
[1:15:09] called to this
[1:15:10] you got to know that he's called you to
[1:15:12] this what was brother branham looking to
[1:15:13] he was looking to the unseen
[1:15:15] looking to the unseen he was going into
[1:15:17] the word and he says though i can't see
[1:15:19] it yet it's going to come forth because
[1:15:21] god you commissioned me you called me
[1:15:22] and you promised me that you would do
[1:15:24] this what if you can get the
[1:15:26] people to believe nothing will stand
[1:15:27] before your prayer not even cancer
[1:15:29] so they had goiters fall off they had
[1:15:31] tumors fall away they had eyes there
[1:15:33] they had legs that were shortened
[1:15:35] increased all these different things why
[1:15:37] because he stood firm in the commission
[1:15:39] that god had given him amen
[1:15:41] brother brown says this very quickly
[1:15:43] you got faith in god stand pat
[1:15:46] god will do it amen listen naaman went
[1:15:50] to the same prophet elisha amen and he
[1:15:52] asked him to heal him of leprosy now
[1:15:54] leprosy was what the disease of outcasts
[1:15:56] because if you had leprosy you were
[1:15:58] supposed to be out with all the other
[1:15:59] lepers in a leper colony but naaman was
[1:16:02] special because he was a captain of the
[1:16:03] of the army he was a general is really
[1:16:05] what we call him today and he was
[1:16:07] somehow allowed he'd managed to make it
[1:16:09] so that he could stay around in society
[1:16:11] somewhat but nobody could touch him
[1:16:12] nobody could be up close to him naaman
[1:16:14] was an outcast but yet he was a great
[1:16:16] man a great warrior
[1:16:18] a man of reputation amongst assyrians
[1:16:20] but yet he had an issue and he had
[1:16:22] something that wouldn't allow him to
[1:16:23] mingle with people
[1:16:24] it made him an outcast
[1:16:26] guess what sometimes we have besetting
[1:16:28] sins sometimes we've got personality
[1:16:29] traits sometimes we've got habits of
[1:16:30] ours that make us an outcast
[1:16:33] right don't just look at name and say
[1:16:34] well he had leprosy and that's different
[1:16:36] than me no guess what we have things
[1:16:38] that we do and say in the ways that we
[1:16:39] approach people and habits and these
[1:16:41] different things and guess what it
[1:16:42] causes people to back up from us
[1:16:44] right but there's a remedy for that
[1:16:47] and then there's a place for that amen
[1:16:50] now what did elisha do with naaman
[1:16:52] so naaman came up with his horses and
[1:16:54] with his chariot and stood at the house
[1:16:56] door of the house of elisha
[1:16:57] and elisha sent a messenger unto him
[1:17:01] catch this now
[1:17:02] he's going to the prophet he's got a
[1:17:04] note from the king introducing him to
[1:17:06] the prophet and when he goes to see the
[1:17:08] prophet the prophet doesn't even see him
[1:17:11] guess what we don't have the prophet
[1:17:12] anymore
[1:17:14] guess what you have brother gerald and
[1:17:16] myself
[1:17:18] that's all god has these days he's got a
[1:17:20] five-fold ministry now
[1:17:22] amen don't get offended if the if the
[1:17:24] messenger gives you a message
[1:17:26] amen it's still god
[1:17:28] it's still god and guess what sometimes
[1:17:30] he gives you a message you don't like
[1:17:32] naaman doesn't like what he's about to
[1:17:33] get
[1:17:34] but it was still the message of the
[1:17:36] prophet amen amen we've got to be able
[1:17:38] to look past the messenger and say is
[1:17:40] the message going to have the effect
[1:17:41] that he's talking about amen but elisha
[1:17:43] sent a messenger to him saying go and
[1:17:45] wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh
[1:17:48] shall come again to thee and thou shalt
[1:17:49] be clean but naaman was wrath and went
[1:17:51] away and said behold i thought he will
[1:17:54] surely come out to me and stand and call
[1:17:56] on the name of the lord is god strike
[1:17:58] his hand over the place and recover the
[1:17:59] leper he was looking for great signs and
[1:18:02] wonders to happen
[1:18:03] because what he'd heard of this elisha
[1:18:05] from the little testimony of the
[1:18:07] israelite slave girl in his home to the
[1:18:09] king
[1:18:10] he knew that something could happen
[1:18:12] he believed it
[1:18:13] but he said i thought he was going to
[1:18:15] come out and do a supernatural work that
[1:18:16] he would come and just good thus saith
[1:18:18] the lord name and be healed from your
[1:18:20] issue
[1:18:21] and i'd been fine
[1:18:23] sometimes we're looking to god that way
[1:18:24] and saying it's going to happen like a
[1:18:25] lightning bolt and sometimes it does
[1:18:28] sometimes it doesn't and we've got to be
[1:18:30] ready for whichever answer he gives us
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:32] amen
[1:18:35] we sometimes think well i've done my
[1:18:36] part so he's just going to do his part
[1:18:38] and that's going to be it it's going to
[1:18:39] be a done deal again sometimes it is
[1:18:42] but don't expect that every time i mean
[1:18:43] god expects us to be able to handle some
[1:18:45] instruction and just at least a small
[1:18:46] test of our faith before we get what
[1:18:48] we're asking for
[1:18:50] listen to this he says are not habana
[1:18:52] and farpara the rivers of damascus
[1:18:54] better than all the waters of israel may
[1:18:56] i not wash in them and be clean so he
[1:18:59] turned and went away in a rage
[1:19:01] he's like listen seriously dirty little
[1:19:03] jordan you're gonna ask me to go down
[1:19:04] there we got better rivers back home
[1:19:07] we got better ministry back home we got
[1:19:09] better gifts back home
[1:19:12] no no no
[1:19:13] prophet said go washington the one i
[1:19:14] send you to
[1:19:16] right
[1:19:18] go send go jordan's the only one that's
[1:19:20] gonna work
[1:19:21] what's jordan
[1:19:23] death
[1:19:24] you got to die naaman
[1:19:26] you got to go around in death you got to
[1:19:27] die out to yourself neyman now name is
[1:19:29] just a he's a he's a heathen
[1:19:31] he's a heathen who knows what happened
[1:19:33] with naaman after this we don't know
[1:19:35] but he says you got to go god's way
[1:19:37] guess what your rivers don't work
[1:19:39] this is the only river that works
[1:19:42] and his servants came near and spake
[1:19:44] unto him and said my father if the
[1:19:45] prophet had bid thee do some great thing
[1:19:48] would shall not have done it how much
[1:19:50] rather than when he said to thee wash
[1:19:51] and be clean sometimes we're so
[1:19:53] unwilling to do the smallest things that
[1:19:55] god asks us but we're so willing to go
[1:19:57] out and try and do something that seems
[1:19:59] completely impossible
[1:20:01] amen elisha if elisha said listen ride
[1:20:04] to the mountains
[1:20:05] and at the base of the mountain there's
[1:20:07] going to be a cave and in that cave is a
[1:20:09] 17-foot giant
[1:20:11] i want you to kill him and then i want
[1:20:12] you to take the strawberries that he has
[1:20:14] growing in his little garden patch in
[1:20:15] front and bring him back to me and we'll
[1:20:17] make a paste and rub it on you and then
[1:20:19] you'll be healed naomi said sign me up i
[1:20:21] can do that why because naaman's a
[1:20:23] soldier
[1:20:24] right he's used to going into battle if
[1:20:26] he had asked naaman to do something that
[1:20:28] that worked with name and strengths
[1:20:30] naaman would have willingly done it why
[1:20:32] because it would have made naaman look
[1:20:33] like a hero it would have made naaman
[1:20:35] look good it would have enhanced his
[1:20:36] reputation his healing would have
[1:20:38] enhanced his reputation if he did it and
[1:20:40] a certain say look if he'd have asked
[1:20:42] you to do something tough you'd have
[1:20:43] done it because you're a soldier and
[1:20:44] you're used to doing tough things but
[1:20:46] all he's done is asked you to go wash in
[1:20:48] the river man
[1:20:50] listen simple obedience will beat
[1:20:52] bravado every single time we're trying
[1:20:56] to do it a different way and god just
[1:20:57] says obey
[1:20:58] just do what i told you to do my word
[1:21:01] tells you how to get this do it my way
[1:21:03] and forget about the rest of it because
[1:21:05] what we want to turn our testimony into
[1:21:07] something about us rather than something
[1:21:09] about god
[1:21:11] naaman wasn't willing to do that at
[1:21:12] least not initially amen amen just
[1:21:15] follow what god says in his word simple
[1:21:17] results
[1:21:18] simple way
[1:21:21] it says then he went then went he down
[1:21:23] and dipped himself seven times in jordan
[1:21:25] according to the saying of the man of
[1:21:26] god and his flesh came again like under
[1:21:28] the flesh of a little child and he was
[1:21:30] clean
[1:21:31] and he returned to the man of god he and
[1:21:33] all his company and came and stood
[1:21:34] before him and he said behold now i know
[1:21:37] there is no god in all the earth but in
[1:21:39] israel now therefore i pray thee take a
[1:21:41] blessing
[1:21:42] of thy servant
[1:21:44] what would name and of god if he dipped
[1:21:45] once
[1:21:47] bupkus zero nada nothing twice
[1:21:51] same result third fourth fifth sixth
[1:21:55] so many of us will stop at six
[1:21:57] so close but we won't go all the way
[1:21:59] what is six
[1:22:00] six is the number man you know what six
[1:22:02] is i've done enough
[1:22:04] i think i've gone far enough lord i
[1:22:06] think i believed long enough i think
[1:22:08] i've put myself on a limb far enough i
[1:22:10] think i've done as much as i need to do
[1:22:12] lord
[1:22:13] but he didn't say six he said seven
[1:22:16] so one through six there's no difference
[1:22:18] whether you start whether you don't
[1:22:20] start or whether you go most of the way
[1:22:21] you go what 84 of the way
[1:22:25] you're still not there you got to go all
[1:22:26] the way to seven six is the number of
[1:22:28] men six means you're so close to healing
[1:22:30] that you can taste it but you stop short
[1:22:32] why because you think your efforts
[1:22:34] what's going to make you whole
[1:22:36] no you got to go all the way that god
[1:22:37] says not as far as you think you can go
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:40] effort is not what gets us results
[1:22:43] obedience gets us results
[1:22:45] right he had to dip seven times and
[1:22:47] guess what i imagine he goes down the
[1:22:49] first time comes up not a single change
[1:22:52] he's like told you guys
[1:22:54] nothing's happening
[1:22:57] do it again naaman down number two comes
[1:23:00] up no difference and i'm starting to
[1:23:02] itch
[1:23:05] do it again naaman three times four
[1:23:07] times five six times he's getting i
[1:23:09] guarantee you he is in a rage
[1:23:12] i told you guys this wouldn't work
[1:23:16] just once more naaman
[1:23:19] just do it one more time
[1:23:21] remember the the the disciples were
[1:23:23] fishing
[1:23:24] they fished all night
[1:23:27] and jesus comes and he says you caught
[1:23:28] anything no he says cashing it on the
[1:23:30] other side they said we've done that all
[1:23:31] day and all night we've got nothing he
[1:23:33] says but
[1:23:34] do it
[1:23:35] and what did peter say at thy word lord
[1:23:39] there's a difference when god tells you
[1:23:40] dude you've been doing it all along but
[1:23:41] then when god tells you to do it guess
[1:23:43] what that's when you get results and
[1:23:44] naaman goes down the seventh time and he
[1:23:47] comes up like a baby now some of us have
[1:23:50] young babies and the the best skin
[1:23:52] you'll ever see is on a baby isn't it
[1:23:54] it is soft it is clean it smells nice
[1:23:57] most of the time it's the best skin for
[1:24:00] a man to have the skin of a baby that's
[1:24:02] a miracle that's not just healing that's
[1:24:04] a regeneration amen is what we're
[1:24:06] talking about and that's what you get
[1:24:08] when you come into the presence of god
[1:24:09] by obedience is you get a complete
[1:24:11] regeneration he takes you back to the
[1:24:13] strength of your youth amen
[1:24:15] listen brother brown says you get to a
[1:24:17] place where you don't know what to do
[1:24:18] and people say he never got healed
[1:24:21] why there's that's things still there if
[1:24:23] god placed that in your heart you stand
[1:24:26] still
[1:24:27] you just keep on testifying to the glory
[1:24:30] of god he says keep on
[1:24:32] what is it you keep on praying until god
[1:24:33] answers you keep on believing till god
[1:24:35] fulfills the promise you keep washing in
[1:24:37] the water of the word until he takes
[1:24:40] that thing out of your life that you've
[1:24:41] had clinging on for so long that thing
[1:24:43] that sets you aside from everyone you
[1:24:45] keep dipping and dipping and dipping and
[1:24:47] dipping and dipping until man gets out
[1:24:50] and god steps in and you'll never be the
[1:24:52] same again
[1:24:53] keep dipping keep dipping
[1:24:56] stay in jordan until you die out and new
[1:24:59] life comes out and what is it it's
[1:25:00] regeneration i mean it's not a new you
[1:25:03] it's a it's not an old you you know
[1:25:05] remade this is an all-new you you're
[1:25:07] come out like a baby you're a what a new
[1:25:09] babe in christ amen you're a new
[1:25:11] creation
[1:25:12] amen like you just come out of the womb
[1:25:14] that's what naaman was like like he just
[1:25:15] come out of the womb that beautiful
[1:25:17] fresh skin amen that's what we're
[1:25:19] talking about and then don't stop when
[1:25:21] you put in enough effort
[1:25:23] when you get tired keep going when you
[1:25:26] get tired keep going and listen you're
[1:25:27] going to have to do it
[1:25:29] you got to keep pressing the battle amen
[1:25:30] and stop when you get the result and
[1:25:33] don't stop until you got the result amen
[1:25:37] brother brown says when you when a man
[1:25:39] takes a word of god
[1:25:40] no matter how little that faith is but
[1:25:42] if it won't mix with any unbelief it
[1:25:44] will bring him out to the light
[1:25:46] some of us has great faith that'll just
[1:25:48] perform miracles
[1:25:50] some has faith just to hold on till it
[1:25:52] happens
[1:25:54] but it's genuine faith wants a hold of
[1:25:56] it and there's nothing going to shake
[1:25:58] you from it listen you got faith up here
[1:25:59] praise the lord you've got faith down
[1:26:00] here praise the lord because both of
[1:26:02] them will take you to the same end
[1:26:04] one might take a little longer than the
[1:26:05] other but it doesn't matter it'll still
[1:26:07] take you all the way through he says it
[1:26:09] ain't gonna mix then that person is
[1:26:10] persistence
[1:26:12] persistent he has perseverance no matter
[1:26:14] how many people says the days of
[1:26:15] miracles has passed he doesn't believe
[1:26:17] it he holds on because he's met the
[1:26:19] conditions and sunk that word into a
[1:26:21] heart of faith that believes it there he
[1:26:23] stays sometimes faith makes you act
[1:26:25] ridiculous to the carnal mind but if
[1:26:28] it's god's word it's got to come to pass
[1:26:30] be persistent see god make it come to
[1:26:33] pass you don't make it come to pass you
[1:26:35] just keep doing what he said in
[1:26:36] obedience and he brings it to pass
[1:26:38] he says john expresses expressed his
[1:26:41] faith in what god had revealed to him
[1:26:43] therefore faith works is faith testimony
[1:26:47] when they see you acting like you're
[1:26:48] healed then they'll know you've got
[1:26:49] faith that you are healed what does
[1:26:51] testimony say listen to this now he says
[1:26:54] testimony is saying i have it now
[1:26:57] because i have received god's promise
[1:27:00] it is now working in me
[1:27:04] what you just said brother jonathan
[1:27:05] you're healed you've got it bro says
[1:27:08] faith's testimony is it is now working
[1:27:10] in me
[1:27:12] i am making ready for it to happen
[1:27:16] uh he says see that's what your works
[1:27:18] does amen
[1:27:19] listen the first six times naaman was
[1:27:21] making ready for it to happen
[1:27:23] that's what he was doing making ready
[1:27:25] for it to happen and on the seventh time
[1:27:27] when god stepped in that's when it
[1:27:28] happened all the rest was just making
[1:27:30] him ready for it to come to pass amen
[1:27:33] full obedience to the full word of god
[1:27:35] entitles us to the token amen and listen
[1:27:38] the token is the holy spirit but that
[1:27:40] goes for every single promise in god's
[1:27:42] word is that full obedience to his word
[1:27:44] entitles you to whatever he's promised
[1:27:47] the oh no other way is there that you
[1:27:49] could ever be entitled to the token
[1:27:50] until you fully obey the word not what
[1:27:52] somebody has put into it and added to it
[1:27:54] but what god said about it amen
[1:27:58] i want to jump over now we're sticking
[1:28:00] with elijah and elisha
[1:28:02] but look at what happened after elijah's
[1:28:04] mount carmel experience
[1:28:06] he's up on mount carmel he's just prayed
[1:28:08] god has answered by fire right he's not
[1:28:11] just consumed the sacrifice he's
[1:28:13] consumed the rock altar that's a hot
[1:28:15] fire that consumes the entire rock
[1:28:17] amen he's just had one of the most
[1:28:19] supernatural experiences of his life in
[1:28:21] front of the nation of israel in front
[1:28:23] of the king
[1:28:25] he's destroyed the prophets of baal and
[1:28:28] then now what happens
[1:28:30] is that he's got to go call for rain
[1:28:32] because what god took him out remember
[1:28:34] he says go tell ahab it's going to rain
[1:28:37] so now he's got a message and his
[1:28:39] message wasn't go destroy the prophets
[1:28:41] his message was
[1:28:42] go tell him it's going to rain but there
[1:28:44] had to be a work done before the rain
[1:28:45] could come he had to prove who was god
[1:28:48] amen and the people stepped forward and
[1:28:49] they said we'll accept god now and with
[1:28:51] that happening with that repentance with
[1:28:53] that recommitment to god now elijah says
[1:28:56] okay time for some rain we've made the
[1:28:58] atmosphere right we've cleaned the
[1:29:00] church out now it's time for the
[1:29:01] blessings to fall
[1:29:03] right
[1:29:05] first kings 18 says and elijah went up
[1:29:07] to the top of carmel and he cast himself
[1:29:10] down upon the earth and put his face
[1:29:11] between his knees
[1:29:13] now listen god said tell ahab it's going
[1:29:14] to rain now what is a what does elijah
[1:29:17] do he goes and he starts praying amen
[1:29:20] elijah spoke the reign out of existence
[1:29:22] by the word of god now he's got to speak
[1:29:24] the reign back into existence by the
[1:29:26] word of god god's using the same vessel
[1:29:28] to take it out and put it back in again
[1:29:29] amen what is it god's inspiration man's
[1:29:32] voice
[1:29:33] that's all you're seeing there it's all
[1:29:34] you're seeing there and he said to his
[1:29:36] servant now listen now go up look toward
[1:29:39] the sea and he went up then looked and
[1:29:41] said there is nothing

[1:29:50] just prayed for rain nothing's happening
[1:29:54] nothing there
[1:29:56] and he said go again
[1:29:58] seven times
[1:30:01] listen it's not just naaman that gets
[1:30:03] tested
[1:30:04] prophet's got to do it seven times as
[1:30:06] well here if we see
[1:30:07] now listen i want you to can you imagine

[1:31:17] preach
[1:31:18] you know how bad you're making me look
[1:31:20] right now lord
[1:31:22] but watch this
[1:31:25] lebron says you've got to first find the
[1:31:26] will of god
[1:31:28] now you've got to find the will of god
[1:31:29] this morning as you're coming to be
[1:31:31] prayed for you've got to find the will
[1:31:33] of god whether it's god's will to heal
[1:31:34] you or not and the next thing you have
[1:31:36] to do if you're coming to get salvation
[1:31:38] you got to find out whether it's god's
[1:31:39] will to save you or not
[1:31:41] the first thing you have to find out is
[1:31:43] what god's will is and then if you have
[1:31:45] really received the seed in your heart
[1:31:47] then you can be persistent there's
[1:31:49] nothing going to move you no matter what
[1:31:51] wisdom man tries to say it's not so and
[1:31:53] it's not this and that and the other it
[1:31:55] doesn't move you one iota because you
[1:31:57] know what the will of god is
[1:31:59] he spoke it into your heart
[1:32:02] your faith sets there and it'll hold
[1:32:04] right on no matter if there's no more
[1:32:06] than like a grain of mustard seed it'll
[1:32:08] bring you
[1:32:10] right out to the place amen have you
[1:32:12] been there
[1:32:14] are you there now
[1:32:15] lord i prayed and i prayed and i prayed
[1:32:19] and i prayed and nothing's happening
[1:32:23] listen god will never hang you out to
[1:32:25] dry
[1:32:26] but he comes through in his time not in
[1:32:28] your time
[1:32:29] amen what is brother brahm saying here
[1:32:30] he's looking for somebody that will hold
[1:32:32] on until the promise comes amen praise
[1:32:36] the lord wait
[1:32:38] when you've met his requirement
[1:32:40] what do i do brother john wait
[1:32:43] that brings your faith to a showdown if
[1:32:45] you have met god's requirements
[1:32:47] or if you have met and god's
[1:32:49] requirements has been made or met and
[1:32:50] you have fully considerate and you have
[1:32:52] done everything that god required you to
[1:32:54] do then your faith rests right there
[1:32:56] that he is
[1:32:59] what you've got to believe that he is
[1:33:01] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:33:03] diligently
[1:33:05] i'd say diligent is at least seven times
[1:33:08] based on what we're reading
[1:33:10] you know
[1:33:12] pray for it seven times
[1:33:14] diligently fervently
[1:33:17] he says be certain of god you know he
[1:33:19] loves to test us he loves to see the
[1:33:21] reaction of your faith did you know that
[1:33:24] god likes to see how you'll react when
[1:33:25] you say oh lord i believe you thou are
[1:33:27] my savior i believe that you are the
[1:33:29] healer i believe that you are the one
[1:33:30] who gives the holy spirit and the thing
[1:33:32] that i'm requiring you are the god who
[1:33:34] gives that you're going to the one that
[1:33:36] you believe can give it to you're not
[1:33:37] going to the bank
[1:33:39] amen you're not going to your job you're
[1:33:40] not going to the world you're coming to
[1:33:42] him and you're saying i believe you're
[1:33:44] the one that can give me this
[1:33:46] he says and then when you confess all
[1:33:48] your sins and promise god what you'll do
[1:33:50] if he'll let you get well and then
[1:33:52] because it don't happen you run off like
[1:33:54] a coward somewhere god can't use that
[1:33:57] there's no way for him to use you
[1:33:58] there's no way for him to answer you
[1:34:00] because he only answers by faith then
[1:34:03] all of a sudden you go away and he can't
[1:34:04] answer
[1:34:05] but real true faith stands there being
[1:34:08] sure that god is
[1:34:10] be certain that he is and if god asks
[1:34:12] this thing to be done to confess your
[1:34:13] sins and so forth and you've done it
[1:34:15] faith says that he is and it's certain
[1:34:17] that it's going to happen
[1:34:18] your request has to be granted he says
[1:34:21] oh i hope you don't miss that if you are
[1:34:22] sure of god
[1:34:24] god is sure of his work he's only
[1:34:26] waiting to test you amen what does the
[1:34:28] scripture say having done all to
[1:34:30] stand run away
[1:34:33] sit down
[1:34:34] turn back
[1:34:36] go someplace else
[1:34:38] having done all the stand do what
[1:34:40] stand
[1:34:42] stand can't move forward don't go
[1:34:43] backward
[1:34:44] stand you've put on the armor of god
[1:34:46] you've repented everything is under the
[1:34:48] blood stand and hold
[1:34:50] that's all just stand and wait
[1:34:53] stand and wait
[1:34:54] stand and wait amen hold fast don't back
[1:34:57] down
[1:34:58] hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:35:00] brother brahm says if you're certain
[1:35:02] you'll wait on him if you're certain
[1:35:03] that he is
[1:35:05] you'll be certain that he provides as
[1:35:06] well
[1:35:07] amen
[1:35:08] glory listen to this it says and it came
[1:35:10] to pass at the seventh time
[1:35:12] that he said behold there ariseth a
[1:35:15] little cloud out of the sea like a man's
[1:35:18] hand and he said go up and say unto ahab
[1:35:21] prepare thy chariot and get down that
[1:35:22] the rain
[1:35:24] not stop thee not
[1:35:26] now listen
[1:35:28] you'd say a little cloud that looks like
[1:35:30] a fist
[1:35:31] seriously
[1:35:33] we've had no rain for three and a half
[1:35:35] years and we've got a little hand of a
[1:35:36] cloud rising up out of the sea this is
[1:35:38] god's answer
[1:35:40] is that elijah was that elijah's
[1:35:42] response
[1:35:43] he says go and tell ahab rain's coming
[1:35:45] and he better get down off the mountain
[1:35:47] fast
[1:35:48] because this blessing will wash him away
[1:35:50] if he stays up here
[1:35:52] that tormentor will get washed away if
[1:35:54] he stays on the place of victory he
[1:35:57] can't stay here with this kind of rain
[1:35:58] that's coming
[1:36:00] he can't hold in the kind of
[1:36:01] rejuvenation he can't stand in the
[1:36:03] hallelujahs of the praises that are
[1:36:04] going to come forth when this rain comes
[1:36:06] and his servants are not saying elijah
[1:36:09] it's just a tiny cloud but elijah's seen
[1:36:11] what eyes of faith amen and he's saying
[1:36:14] no no no you don't understand
[1:36:16] we haven't had a cloud for three and a
[1:36:18] half years
[1:36:20] when a cloud comes that means that it's
[1:36:21] all coming now all of heaven's opening
[1:36:24] up now and though it only looks like a
[1:36:26] little thing
[1:36:28] only looks like a little conversation it
[1:36:30] only looks like a little weight loss it
[1:36:31] only looks like a little in road
[1:36:34] it's going to open up into what
[1:36:36] a glorious rainfall and it's going to
[1:36:38] saturate this so heavily that we're not

[1:37:34] believe amen what is it the answer's on
[1:37:37] the way amen i see the answer that

[1:38:35] check brother john
[1:38:36] full obedience entitles you to the token
[1:38:40] all you're doing is writing your name
[1:38:42] and saying what
[1:38:43] that's for jonathan corlett
[1:38:47] that's for ellie colombo yes sir that's
[1:38:50] for leah collins
[1:38:52] that's for kim coffee
[1:38:54] that's for vice shaw that's mine
[1:38:57] that's all you're doing saying this is
[1:38:58] mine
[1:38:59] this is mine
[1:39:00] this is mine
[1:39:02] anybody can try to take somebody who
[1:39:03] knows what they're trying to do it
[1:39:05] that's right he says it isn't a try we
[1:39:07] don't go at tride if you got faith you
[1:39:09] don't try you go do it because you know
[1:39:11] you can
[1:39:12] amen what
[1:39:14] you're not going and creating the money
[1:39:17] you're not putting money in the bank
[1:39:18] all you're saying is i'm a child of god
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:22] glory you're not trying to be a child of
[1:39:24] god i am a child of god and as that i
[1:39:27] get to write my name on the check yes
[1:39:28] sir
[1:39:29] so you got to know who you are amen
[1:39:31] that's all
[1:39:32] and then you do that you write that name
[1:39:34] on that check
[1:39:35] and then one day it shows up in your
[1:39:36] what bank account
[1:39:38] it's that simple it's that simple
[1:39:41] supreme confidence in the one who made
[1:39:42] the promise is what gives you that faith
[1:39:45] amen what did he say you've got to know
[1:39:47] that he is
[1:39:49] and he's rewarded them to diligently
[1:39:50] seek him and guess what who diligently
[1:39:52] seeks him believers
[1:39:54] right his children seek him that's the
[1:39:56] only one seek him
[1:39:57] the rest of him only seek him for what
[1:39:59] his handouts but we seek him with all of
[1:40:01] our heart and soul and mind amen
[1:40:04] listen
[1:40:05] elijah is up here and he's praying for
[1:40:07] rain why because he was commissioned and
[1:40:09] he was authorized and on that basis he
[1:40:12] could expect rain to come
[1:40:14] didn't matter if it took one try or it
[1:40:16] took seven tries
[1:40:17] seven tries is what it took but he
[1:40:19] stayed there until he got the results
[1:40:21] why because god said you got to bring
[1:40:22] rain
[1:40:23] you got to bring a message of rain so
[1:40:25] that you stay there until the rain comes
[1:40:27] and then as soon as he saw that he said
[1:40:29] let him know it's coming amen
[1:40:31] brother brown says i think it's
[1:40:33] come to a time that when we've got to
[1:40:35] know how we stand
[1:40:37] how can you do anything unless you got
[1:40:38] faith in what you're doing you've got to
[1:40:40] have faith and that's my purpose of
[1:40:43] doing this with the church here is to
[1:40:44] give the believers faith and confidence
[1:40:46] in what they're standing for because it
[1:40:48] is the word of the lord then as long as
[1:40:50] through the scriptures it's sovereignly
[1:40:52] placed from genesis into revelation back
[1:40:54] and forth and up and down not a way for
[1:40:56] the devil to move in there anywhere then
[1:40:58] you got perfect confidence see you know
[1:41:01] where you're standing
[1:41:02] don't be a one scripture christian
[1:41:04] that's what he's saying
[1:41:05] right that's how you get into all these
[1:41:07] isms and ideas and messed up things amen
[1:41:10] it's one scripture he says pull it from
[1:41:12] genesis to revelation if you can do that
[1:41:13] you're good to go
[1:41:15] trust god and believe it amen
[1:41:17] i love that about elijah though that he
[1:41:19] gets down and he prays and he prays and
[1:41:20] he prays but what as soon as he saw that
[1:41:23] single cloud he didn't have to pray
[1:41:24] anymore
[1:41:25] glory he didn't say it's small lord make
[1:41:28] it bigger lord we need a bigger cloud
[1:41:31] lord he said that's the answer
[1:41:34] we got to get out of here because it'll
[1:41:35] wash us off the mountain too if we stick
[1:41:37] around
[1:41:38] listen it says and it came this is what
[1:41:40] a little cloud when god does a little
[1:41:41] cloud this is what it turns into and it
[1:41:43] came to pass in the meanwhile that the
[1:41:46] heaven was black with clouds and wind
[1:41:49] and there was a great rain that went
[1:41:51] from a little cloud like a fist to black
[1:41:53] with clouds and wind and there was a
[1:41:55] great rain and ahab road and went to
[1:41:57] jezreel now watch this and the hand of
[1:42:00] the lord was on a lodge and he girded up
[1:42:02] his loins and ran before ahab to the
[1:42:04] entrance of israel
[1:42:06] under the blessings and anointing of god
[1:42:07] aham outran the fastest horses and
[1:42:09] chariots in the country amen amen oh man
[1:42:13] when you got a message
[1:42:15] brother jail when you got a message
[1:42:16] sometimes you feel like you can run you
[1:42:18] can run through a troop and leap over a
[1:42:20] wall-e man but listen when you see the
[1:42:22] answer coming
[1:42:24] you can run through anything you can
[1:42:26] beat the fastest cars you can beat the
[1:42:27] fastest chariots you can outrun them all
[1:42:30] why because the answer's on the way amen
[1:42:33] and i'm going to what let them know it's
[1:42:34] coming amen this is my message this is
[1:42:37] my testimony i'm letting them know it's
[1:42:39] coming today i'll outrun the king on
[1:42:41] this one
[1:42:43] isaiah 52 7 says what how beautiful upon
[1:42:46] the mountains are the feet of him
[1:42:48] that bringeth good tidings question is
[1:42:50] who's bringing the good tidings
[1:42:52] the one that's in prayer amen the one
[1:42:54] that's looking
[1:42:55] you're the one that's got to carry that
[1:42:56] this isn't just the ministry it's
[1:42:58] generally talking about that but listen
[1:43:00] your testimony will run before the
[1:43:02] answer is even here you see it come you
[1:43:04] say here it comes get ready boys
[1:43:06] get ready brothers and sisters the
[1:43:07] answer is on the way what are the feet
[1:43:10] of him that bringeth good tidings that
[1:43:12] publishes peace peace that bringeth good
[1:43:14] tidings of good that publishes salvation
[1:43:18] that saith unto zion thy
[1:43:20] god
[1:43:21] reigneth
[1:43:22] you've got to believe that he is
[1:43:26] and then what you go out and you say our
[1:43:28] god reigns
[1:43:30] our god reigns he's coming
[1:43:33] oh
[1:43:35] i wish i could preach
[1:43:38] oh man
[1:43:40] those feet when they're bringing good
[1:43:41] tidings they'll outrun every tormentor
[1:43:43] every devil every demon every sickness
[1:43:46] everything that's dragging you down all
[1:43:47] of a sudden what you got wings on your
[1:43:50] feet when you see the answer come and
[1:43:52] when you believe it with all your heart
[1:43:53] and by eyes of faith you see it it will
[1:43:55] outrun and it'll tell that tormentor
[1:43:57] your time's up
[1:43:59] your time is up you've got to go amen
[1:44:02] says and when your faith is put to a
[1:44:04] test then don't fail stay right with
[1:44:07] what you believe
[1:44:09] faith knows no defeat faith is perfect
[1:44:12] faith brings things when there is no
[1:44:14] things to be brought
[1:44:17] there's nothing there brother john i got
[1:44:20] nothing to work with
[1:44:21] i got nothing praise the lord that means
[1:44:24] it's supernatural
[1:44:26] elijah didn't create a cloud
[1:44:29] elijah prayed until god made a cloud and
[1:44:32] then god turned it into what something
[1:44:33] that would drown away everything that
[1:44:35] had harmed them in the past
[1:44:36] what is it it's not what you bring
[1:44:39] it's not what you bring it has nothing
[1:44:41] to do with it faith creates
[1:44:45] faith creates
[1:44:49] if your attitude can create an
[1:44:50] atmosphere then your word under that can
[1:44:52] create something that doesn't exist
[1:44:54] right now
[1:44:55] amen that you can bring into existence
[1:44:57] something that was not there before
[1:44:59] faith brings things when there is no
[1:45:01] things to be brought faith creates faith
[1:45:03] takes doubt away now watch this
[1:45:06] takes negative
[1:45:07] and makes positive
[1:45:10] they tell you this myth you know if you
[1:45:11] work out you can turn fat into muscle
[1:45:13] that's not true you don't convert fat
[1:45:15] into muscle what you do is you burn up
[1:45:16] fat and you generate muscle but you
[1:45:19] don't turn fat into muscle there is no
[1:45:20] process that turns fat magically into
[1:45:22] muscle
[1:45:23] hopefully nobody's on that one right it
[1:45:25] doesn't happen
[1:45:26] but less than what he says it says faith
[1:45:28] takes negative and makes positive faith
[1:45:30] takes fat and turns it into muscle is
[1:45:32] what he's saying
[1:45:33] it'll take what can't be done and turn
[1:45:34] it into what needs to be done that's
[1:45:36] what we're talking about here he says
[1:45:38] how beautiful faith is not mythical
[1:45:40] something mentally worked up it's an
[1:45:42] absolutely fundamental result that
[1:45:44] happens where
[1:45:45] in a person's heart when faith is
[1:45:47] appropriated then it is something in the
[1:45:49] person's heart but it can't be based on
[1:45:51] say well go touch a tree and you'll get
[1:45:53] well or pray to the post
[1:45:55] right don't set up your little thing
[1:45:57] don't set up your little ism your little
[1:45:59] religion he says it's got to have a
[1:46:01] foundation and where is that the word of
[1:46:02] god
[1:46:04] now there are times where we believe and
[1:46:06] nothing happens and guess what nothing
[1:46:08] ever will
[1:46:09] and that's the sovereignty of god right
[1:46:13] because why we're in a fallen condition
[1:46:14] we're in a fallen world we're not
[1:46:16] guaranteed everything listen we had
[1:46:17] sister laura collins how many people
[1:46:19] around the world were praying for lord
[1:46:20] collins and guess what she still died
[1:46:23] is that because we didn't have faith i
[1:46:24] don't believe that for a second
[1:46:26] but it was what god's sovereign choice
[1:46:28] to take her
[1:46:29] right and we've got to be okay with that
[1:46:32] amen but god will usually give you an
[1:46:34] answer on those things he'll let you
[1:46:36] know and you'll see later why he did it
[1:46:39] yeah but paul had this if you remember
[1:46:41] paul had an issue he had a thorn in his
[1:46:43] flesh if you remember
[1:46:44] and we're gonna read the scripture
[1:46:46] because i want to i want to address this
[1:46:47] type of situation because i want to say
[1:46:49] that that exception that is the
[1:46:51] exception not the rule we should be
[1:46:53] expecting and believing for the promises
[1:46:54] not that they're not for us
[1:46:56] right he doesn't give us promises so
[1:46:58] that most of us are the exception to the
[1:46:59] promise that that doesn't make any sense
[1:47:01] he gives us the promise because it's for
[1:47:03] most of us it's for all of us unless he
[1:47:05] tells us otherwise but listen to this in
[1:47:08] second corinthians paul said unless i
[1:47:09] should be exalted above measure through
[1:47:11] the abundance of the revelations there
[1:47:13] was given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[1:47:16] messenger of satan to buff at me lest i
[1:47:18] should be exalted above measure so paul
[1:47:20] is saying there that he was not healed
[1:47:21] or delivered why
[1:47:23] to keep him humble
[1:47:26] that's the only reason
[1:47:28] was to keep him humble god left it there
[1:47:30] to keep paul from getting prideful and
[1:47:32] paul admits it
[1:47:34] he says for this thing i besought the
[1:47:36] lord thrice that it might depart from me
[1:47:38] so he prayed three times four he asked
[1:47:40] and asked until he got an answer
[1:47:43] listen no answer is not an answer
[1:47:46] that's not it you say well i prayed and
[1:47:48] prayed and i don't have an answer
[1:47:49] therefore it must not be for me that's
[1:47:50] not what that's not the example we see
[1:47:52] in the scripture the answer is you pray
[1:47:54] until he tells you and if he doesn't
[1:47:56] tell you then the promise is on the way
[1:47:57] until he tells you otherwise right
[1:47:59] okay and he said unto me
[1:48:02] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:48:05] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:48:06] i've been listening to perfect strength
[1:48:08] and perfect weakness
[1:48:09] but i want you to catch this shift in
[1:48:11] thinking now so watch paul's response to
[1:48:13] all of this
[1:48:15] most gladly
[1:48:17] therefore
[1:48:19] will i rather glory in my infirmities
[1:48:22] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:48:24] me
[1:48:25] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[1:48:28] in reproaches in necessities and
[1:48:30] persecutions in distresses for christ's
[1:48:32] sake for when i am weak
[1:48:35] then am i then am i strong so can i say
[1:48:37] this if it's in your situ if this is in
[1:48:39] your situation then this is your
[1:48:41] attitude
[1:48:42] if this is what god's doing in your life
[1:48:44] then this is the attitude you're going
[1:48:45] to have towards it paul says i glory in
[1:48:48] my infirmities i take pleasure in my
[1:48:51] shortcomings that what even despite
[1:48:54] those things god is able to use me paul
[1:48:56] never used it as an excuse to not
[1:48:58] fulfill his ministry or purpose
[1:49:01] and we don't know what it was there's
[1:49:02] things that people that say well it was
[1:49:04] his eyesight there was people that said
[1:49:05] he had a besetting sin we don't know we
[1:49:07] don't know for certain what it is but
[1:49:09] all we know is that paul never let it
[1:49:11] stop him from being what called god had
[1:49:12] called him to be he says rather i will
[1:49:14] glory that despite my weakness despite
[1:49:18] my condition despite what i'm dealing
[1:49:20] with all the time he still uses me he
[1:49:22] still loves me he still meets my need he
[1:49:25] still calls me and he still uses me
[1:49:27] effectively in his kingdom
[1:49:28] that's the mindset of a believer in this
[1:49:30] situation is that they glory in it look
[1:49:32] at fanny crosby
[1:49:33] you talk about somebody that gloried in
[1:49:35] their infirmity completely blind and she
[1:49:37] wrote some of the most amazing hymns on
[1:49:39] the planet
[1:49:40] completely blind
[1:49:41] i guarantee you she wouldn't have done
[1:49:43] that if she'd gotten her healing
[1:49:45] she'd probably wrote in a whole new hymn
[1:49:47] but god left her there so that what she
[1:49:49] could do what bring praise and worship
[1:49:50] and glory to him
[1:49:52] but i'm sure god let her know as
[1:49:54] well this is the attitude that we're
[1:49:57] looking for right
[1:49:58] what your your your weakness your
[1:50:01] shortcoming turns into your testimony
[1:50:04] he says this is my testimony is that
[1:50:06] even though i have this issue he's still
[1:50:08] working through me he's a prophet of the
[1:50:11] age and he's got a weakness in his flesh
[1:50:13] whatever it is
[1:50:14] his testimony is what that through it
[1:50:16] all
[1:50:17] what the power of christ may rest upon
[1:50:19] me amen that's what brought him to that
[1:50:21] place was that the power of christ
[1:50:22] brought him through it got him over it
[1:50:24] allowed him to work through it whatever
[1:50:25] that case was and it never slowed paul
[1:50:28] down it never made him ineffective amen
[1:50:30] amen we're in a sinful body in the
[1:50:32] sinful world and that stain can never be
[1:50:33] removed that's why we need a new body
[1:50:36] right but our soul is sealed but there's
[1:50:38] going to be a battle all the way to the
[1:50:39] rapture between those two things amen
[1:50:41] and sometimes god leaves something in
[1:50:42] this carnal flesh to hold us back a bit
[1:50:44] to keep us from getting too proud
[1:50:46] right
[1:50:47] what to get us to realize that this is
[1:50:49] still his working in our life that all
[1:50:51] the victory sometimes the victory is
[1:50:53] that you can have the victory even when
[1:50:55] you're fighting all the time
[1:50:57] that's sometimes the victory is that you
[1:50:58] never let it get you
[1:51:00] right that it never overcomes you
[1:51:02] but it keeps you going back to the cross
[1:51:04] to the cross to the cross every single
[1:51:06] time
[1:51:07] brother brown would say sometimes god
[1:51:08] asks you to do things that's ridiculous
[1:51:10] to your own human thinking remember man
[1:51:13] does not know god by his head he knows
[1:51:15] him by his heart in the garden of eden a
[1:51:17] man was divided between god and satan
[1:51:19] satan took his head god took his heart
[1:51:22] with his intellectuals he tries to
[1:51:23] reason things out but by faith in his
[1:51:25] heart through god will make him believe
[1:51:27] things that reason won't even vindicate
[1:51:30] for it's the substance of things hoped
[1:51:31] for the evidence of things not seen see
[1:51:34] he's got to believe god's word oh
[1:51:36] brother if you could just get that down
[1:51:38] good and sunk in your heart it'd make
[1:51:40] every devil jump and leave right now see
[1:51:43] he says to know
[1:51:45] it does it
[1:51:47] you've got to know he's there
[1:51:49] now what i'm speaking of this is 31
[1:51:51] years in the ministry for me and i've
[1:51:53] never sincerely all in my life ever
[1:51:56] asked god anything with this bible open
[1:51:59] unless he gave it to me or
[1:52:01] told me why he couldn't do it
[1:52:04] he says god's always giving me an answer
[1:52:07] if it ain't happening
[1:52:09] and it's because of me or because of a
[1:52:11] bigger purpose he lets me know but he
[1:52:12] says otherwise every single promise in
[1:52:15] the book he's fulfilled it every time
[1:52:17] eventually he says that's right because
[1:52:19] there's sometimes he can't give it to me
[1:52:21] because i think i want it and he knows
[1:52:23] better
[1:52:25] but he always come and told me why and
[1:52:27] so i know that's true so god keeps his
[1:52:30] word you can just depend on it
[1:52:33] and when i want to close with just a
[1:52:35] couple scriptures and quotes here just
[1:52:36] as a bit of a note of encouragement like
[1:52:38] i said i'm going to be headed away for
[1:52:39] two weeks of vacation you don't want to
[1:52:41] stop on a down note you want to you
[1:52:42] wanna make sure you go away with a good
[1:52:44] one so let's read james five here and it
[1:52:45] says behold we count them happy which
[1:52:49] endure so in other words he's saying we
[1:52:51] see that
[1:52:52] people that hold on and endure they're
[1:52:55] glad
[1:52:56] they're glad they did it they're glad
[1:52:57] they stuck it out they're glad that they
[1:52:59] pressed on they're glad that they held
[1:53:01] on all the way to the finish he says why
[1:53:04] you have heard of the patience of job
[1:53:06] and have seen the end of the lord that
[1:53:08] the lord is very pitiful and of tender
[1:53:10] mercy now we look at pitiful today and
[1:53:13] we say well somebody's pitiful
[1:53:15] somebody's pitiful well they just
[1:53:17] you know they're ugly they have no iq
[1:53:19] they don't have a great job their spouse
[1:53:21] is ugly you know whatever pitiful
[1:53:23] they're in a pitiful situation right
[1:53:25] they don't have their health their
[1:53:27] whatever pitiful that's not what god's
[1:53:29] talk that it's talking about
[1:53:31] pitiful means full of pity
[1:53:33] as in full of pity for what us
[1:53:36] that he's looking out for us that he's
[1:53:38] he's trying to bring us to a better
[1:53:39] place amen he's full of pity for our
[1:53:41] what fallen condition
[1:53:44] and he's what of a tender mercy but
[1:53:46] above all things my brethren swear not
[1:53:48] neither by heaven neither by the earth
[1:53:49] neither by any other oath but let your
[1:53:52] yay be yay and your yay binet your navy
[1:53:54] nay
[1:53:55] so if you said yes stay yes and if you
[1:53:58] said no stay no
[1:53:59] don't go back and forth it is for me it
[1:54:01] isn't for me it is for me it isn't for
[1:54:03] me i believe it i don't believe it it's
[1:54:05] all on god it's all on me no no he says
[1:54:09] once you've done it commit it to him
[1:54:11] and if you don't then don't
[1:54:13] but don't go back and forth you're not
[1:54:15] going to get anywhere with that
[1:54:16] lest you fall into what condemnation is
[1:54:19] there any among you afflicted let him
[1:54:21] pray is any merry let him sing songs
[1:54:24] psalms is any sick among you let him
[1:54:27] call for the elders of the church and
[1:54:29] let them pray over him anointing him
[1:54:30] with oil in the name of the lord and the
[1:54:33] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[1:54:35] the lord shall raise him up and if he
[1:54:37] have committed sins they shall be
[1:54:38] forgiven him
[1:54:40] confess your faults one to another and
[1:54:42] pray for one another that ye may be
[1:54:45] healed the effectual fervent prayer
[1:54:49] of a righteous man availeth much that
[1:54:51] means it's very effective
[1:54:53] it gets things done
[1:54:55] brother braham says the effectual
[1:54:56] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:54:58] availeth much oh if you only knew that
[1:55:00] in your hand christ gave us the
[1:55:02] authority with his name by being
[1:55:04] christians the most powerful weapon the
[1:55:06] world has ever known prayer it even
[1:55:08] changes everything and we find out in
[1:55:11] james 5 15 that the bible said the
[1:55:13] effectual fervent he says that's
[1:55:15] desperation
[1:55:17] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:55:19] man availeth much when a righteous man a
[1:55:21] good man gets in travail he says or soul
[1:55:24] travail that's right oh this is not just
[1:55:26] uh i'm gonna i'm gonna get down on my

[1:55:47] ellie

[1:55:52] on the front seat and he's smiling and

[1:56:19] checkbook
[1:56:20] here's my checkbook
[1:56:22] i'm filling it out for my brother or
[1:56:23] sister this morning
[1:56:25] see notice what the bible says here in
[1:56:27] james 5 16 said confessing our faults
[1:56:31] oh brother i'm desperate
[1:56:33] have you confessed your faults
[1:56:36] making ready for it he says confessing
[1:56:38] our faults one to another
[1:56:41] he says having no faults people asked to
[1:56:43] pray for you confessing our faults one
[1:56:45] to another and praying one for the other
[1:56:47] there you are with love that i got
[1:56:49] confidence i can confess to you my wrong
[1:56:52] and you can confess to me you're wrong
[1:56:54] and i love you well enough that i'll
[1:56:56] pray for you and you pray for me and
[1:56:59] we'll stay with it with a factual
[1:57:02] fervent prayer
[1:57:03] until it's answered
[1:57:05] that's desperation that's what we should
[1:57:08] have
[1:57:09] all the
[1:57:10] time
[1:57:12] amen god bless you let's stand together
[1:57:13] if you would
[1:57:14] when somebody asks us to pray
[1:57:16] this is the kind of prayer we want
[1:57:18] you know what that takes you know he
[1:57:20] talked there about love and confessing
[1:57:21] faults one to another we see these big
[1:57:23] needs sometimes and they come through
[1:57:24] and we can pray we can pray for those
[1:57:27] people but you know who you can really
[1:57:28] pray for
[1:57:29] these people right here because guess
[1:57:31] what i know paul and i know joe and i
[1:57:32] know sister maureen and brother mark and
[1:57:34] sister brenda and brother bob and all
[1:57:35] the way back down i know you i know your
[1:57:37] lives i know your families i know your
[1:57:39] situations i know you
[1:57:41] and i can get in
[1:57:43] and pray for somebody that i know
[1:57:45] sometimes great needs come across and
[1:57:47] you bow your head and you say lord grant
[1:57:48] grace but we don't know anything about
[1:57:50] that person we don't know what god's
[1:57:51] doing what he might be trying to do we
[1:57:53] don't have a clue but if i got to pray
[1:57:55] for brother bob then i know what's going
[1:57:57] on in brother bob's life right i know
[1:57:58] what's going on in brother ellie's life
[1:57:59] i know what's going on brother josh's i
[1:58:01] know what's going on brother joe's and
[1:58:02] brother chads and these different ones i
[1:58:03] know what's going on so i can get in
[1:58:05] there and i can pray for them
[1:58:06] because what i trust them and they trust
[1:58:08] me
[1:58:09] that what as we confess our faults one
[1:58:11] to another as we say brother i got a
[1:58:13] weakness
[1:58:14] oh sister would you pray for me i'm
[1:58:15] really struggling with this and and my
[1:58:17] husband this and that and what we can
[1:58:20] trust that that person is not going to
[1:58:21] go tell it to somebody they're going to
[1:58:22] go take it before god and say god they
[1:58:24] trusted me enough they love me enough to
[1:58:26] share with me their need and i'm going
[1:58:28] to take them before your throne and i'm
[1:58:29] going to pray and i'm going to pray and
[1:58:31] they'll be on my prayer list until you
[1:58:32] answer that prayer and i'm going to stay
[1:58:34] there in desperation i'm going to get
[1:58:35] into your presence i'm going to fight
[1:58:37] into your presence guess what desperate
[1:58:39] people don't stop with the knock
[1:58:41] they don't stop with the knock because
[1:58:42] what he says knock and it'll be opened
[1:58:45] seek and you will find amen you can't be
[1:58:47] seeking it's funny
[1:58:49] you tell jensen
[1:58:50] jensen go find your shoes and what does
[1:58:52] he do he walks into where the shoes are
[1:58:54] supposed to be says they're not there
[1:58:55] and says i can't find them
[1:58:57] that's not seeking your shoes is it
[1:58:59] seeking your shoes as you go from room
[1:59:01] to room to room upstairs downstairs
[1:59:04] outside wherever it is and you seek
[1:59:06] until you do what you find those shoes
[1:59:08] now if he had a desperation to find
[1:59:10] those shoes as in you're getting a
[1:59:12] spanking if you don't find those 80
[1:59:14] shoes that we just bought you last week
[1:59:16] he'd look a lot tighter wouldn't he he'd
[1:59:17] look into every nook and cranny he'd
[1:59:19] search every room until he found those
[1:59:20] shoes but if he thinks that it's just a
[1:59:22] casual jensen finds your shoes he won't
[1:59:24] go looking
[1:59:26] do we go and say lord
[1:59:28] help brother chad help his shoulders
[1:59:30] lord
[1:59:32] now i lay me down to sleep
[1:59:35] there's no desperation there is there
[1:59:36] brother chad
[1:59:38] there's no desperation there
[1:59:40] but i say lord brother chad he needs his
[1:59:42] shoulders to work
[1:59:45] well brother chad needs
[1:59:46] his back to be better
[1:59:48] so he can drive day in and day out
[1:59:51] so he can get up in the morning i had my
[1:59:53] back bad for one day brother chad
[1:59:55] and it gave me an appreciation for what
[1:59:56] he deals with every single day
[1:59:58] that was horrible absolutely horrible
[2:00:00] guess what i'll pray for brother chad
[2:00:02] differently from now on because what i
[2:00:04] can't imagine if every morning i had to
[2:00:06] deal with what he has to deal with every
[2:00:07] single day
[2:00:08] what is it we get into a desperation and
[2:00:10] that comes with what experiencing them
[2:00:12] being a part of them being a part of a
[2:00:14] body loving rubbing the rough burrs off
[2:00:16] of each other from time to time amen
[2:00:18] it'll get us into desperation because
[2:00:20] what i care about you and i know you
[2:00:21] care about me that's why i'm taking you
[2:00:23] before that throne of grace amen
[2:00:25] what is it the effectual fervent prayer
[2:00:27] of a believer
[2:00:28] it has an effect
[2:00:30] amen i believe we ought to be seeing
[2:00:31] effects
[2:00:32] and this is not a time where we just are
[2:00:34] casual about this amen it's going home
[2:00:36] time amen
[2:00:37] it's time to get out of here
[2:00:39] we got to get desperate about it not
[2:00:40] just about our bodies but about our walk
[2:00:42] with god about our sincerity amen about
[2:00:45] our sanctification in our lives about
[2:00:47] our children getting baptized getting
[2:00:48] the holy ghost them and we need the last
[2:00:50] one in so that the rest of us can go
[2:00:52] amen we ought to be out there looking
[2:00:53] for what desperate for the souls that
[2:00:55] need to come in so we can get out of
[2:00:57] here amen
[2:00:58] amen
[2:01:00] god's grace to us
[2:01:01] amen let's just bow our heads
[2:01:04] heavenly father
[2:01:07] lord having done all the stand
[2:01:09] lord may you pour in your holy spirit
[2:01:12] lord raise up a standard and help us to
[2:01:14] stand confessing your word
[2:01:17] lord not just confessing your word but
[2:01:18] confessing our shortcomings heavenly
[2:01:20] father lord and in doing so lord that
[2:01:22] prayer it closes up the gaps in the
[2:01:24] holes in the armor heavenly father it
[2:01:26] allows you to move on the scene lord it
[2:01:28] keeps the enemy back heavenly father
[2:01:30] when we can just humble ourselves before
[2:01:32] each other before your throne of grace
[2:01:34] lord god and come and say lord we're
[2:01:36] standing in need of prayer once more

[2:01:40] lord of rejuvenating lord a cleaning
[2:01:42] lord a cleansing lord we're standing in
[2:01:44] need of a fresh outpouring of the holy
[2:01:46] spirit in our lives lord god lord would
[2:01:49] you give us faith to stand once more
[2:01:50] lord would you lift up weak hands lord
[2:01:53] strengthen weak knees heavenly father
[2:01:54] straighten our past lord by your word
[2:01:57] lord that we would know your will and
[2:01:58] our way and your way in our lives lord
[2:02:00] god
[2:02:01] lord that it would give us faith and
[2:02:02] confidence that lord we can hold on to
[2:02:04] you and that the answer is on the way
[2:02:06] lord bless your people now we ask or may
[2:02:08] you just minister to hearts and souls
[2:02:10] may your spirit just flow amongst us
[2:02:12] lord as we worship and praise you lord
[2:02:14] because we believe you are lord that you
[2:02:16] are here that you are working in our
[2:02:18] midst lord and that you do great things
[2:02:20] for us lord help us to trust you lord

[2:32:49] says that faith cometh by hearing
[2:32:53] hearing the word of god
[2:32:55] look god did not say faith cometh by
[2:32:58] healing the first pull or discerning the
[2:33:01] second pull but the third pull in the
[2:33:04] word opens up and we see ourselves in
[2:33:06] the book
[2:33:08] there's no greater faith than that lord
[2:33:10] god
[2:33:11] to know that we were in your mind before
[2:33:14] the world began
[2:33:16] lord god what security what assurance
[2:33:19] lord
[2:33:21] lord god almighty one
[2:33:24] that's why your prophet said lord god
[2:33:25] i'm tired of the gifts
[2:33:28] lord please get me to jordan

[2:33:33] mountain going around and around

[2:33:38] the river
[2:33:39] when you said as john the baptist

[2:33:44] so i send you with that message
[2:33:46] and your prophet says that's the message
[2:33:48] that made the bible become a new book
[2:33:52] lord for the god faith lord god
[2:33:55] of our fathers
[2:33:57] returning in this age
