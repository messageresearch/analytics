just let go and have let it have its way in our lives Lord Jesus Lord help us to lay our own selves aside this morning Lord to take your word and your word alone Lord to trust you completely in our lives we pray Lord just have your way now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen amen God bless you turn if you would again to John chapter 14 John 14 and6 is where we'll start amen good to see brother Jim back with us again he's headed home I think Tuesday anden God bless you brother Jim take our greetings back to the Saints and brother Chris brother ab and the different ones there in BC amen good to have Selena back with us as well thankful for God's grace and provision and bringing her through her schooling and kind of closing off that chapter and now she moves into a new chapter amen we're trusting God to be with her and each one amen ones that are at that place in life amen John chapter 14 same scripture we read on Wednesday night Jesus speaking to the disciples he says I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen God bless you you can have your seats again this evening we're continuing this series on the Holy Ghost and we start on Wednesday night with this thought on the spirit of Truth some issues with the clicker brother Matt you can work with me here even the spirit of Truth uh so we're going to take a a second uh service on this idea of the spirit of Truth and I want to take this in quite a different angle from last time because we know that we showed last service that the holy spirit will always point a person back to the word of God Amen you know you're being led by the spirit because it points you back to the word remember what scripture says Jesus said Thy word is truth so if you have the spirit of Truth it will point you back to the word that is truth amen so we know that the truth is always linked to the spirit because the holy spirit is what makes the word live it's what makes truth come to reality in our lives it's the life it's the power it's the strength of the word of God Amen it's all one and the same thing so when somebody says I feel led to do something I L feel led to do such and such or go so you know this place or that place and they're professing Christian what they're trying to say is I believe that the holy spirit is leading me that's what they're saying when they say that amen but we don't blindly accept those words we ought not to amen we ought not to do when somebody says I feel led to do something I we don't we don't say I don't believe that you're not lad but the question we have to ask is are you led by the Holy Spirit and how do we do that we go back to the word of God Amen we take what they say and we compare it to the word of God and it doesn't matter how great their Ministry is how much they've been right in the past how great their life has been to this point we always take leadership back to the word of God because that is always the absolute amen so when somebody says I feel led to do such and such we take it back to the word of God to see if they are being led of God or not amen doesn't matter how much we love that person how much we respect them how much we appreciate them we always take it back to the word of God why because the word of God is the discerner that's the discerner of these different things amen if I can stay with the word of God I always have discernment because the word discerns so I don't have to do it if I can stay with the revealed word of God it cuts through the religion it cuts through the spirituality it cuts through the emotion it cuts through the respect it cuts through the image all of these different things and it brings us down to Solid Ground that's what the word does amen I don't have to know your motives and objectives if I know what the word of God says I don't have to know your character if I know what the word of God says I can take what you're saying and what you're doing and compare it to the word of God and that will tell me where you're at in this decision remember what Paul said in the book of Hebrews he says for the word of God is quick that word means alive amen this isn't a dead word that we believe this morning it's living amen and it's living by the spirit of God Amen for the word of God is alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing the sun of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and it says the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so I don't have to judge the people that say and do certain things I'm not judging judging the person but I can judge the action by the word amen we judge the action we don't judge the person they may be fooled they may be intentionally ignoring something amen they may not even have the Holy Ghost we don't know what we don't know am me so many times I mean we can look around uh the body of Christ and we can see people that we absolutely believe 100% that they had the Holy Ghost and yet they walked away eventually Paul says it Deus has forsaken me he he did Ministry with Deus and this one did it because he loved this present world and that one and these and listen Paul had the Holy Ghost and he still worked with these men and in the end they fell away amen but we don't go around judging people amen but what we do is we stay with the word and then the word discerns the situation amen somebody can do the wrong thing for the right reason and we go around and if we start judging that person then we missed the mark because if they are sincere even their wrongness and they're a child of God what will God do God will bring the word to that person and he'll give them the opportunity to see that what they did was wrong and then what happens is if they're a child of God they'll see their error they'll repent they'll change their mind about what they were doing and they'll line up with the word and then the word then has discerned the thoughts and intents it proves that their intention was to do good anyone ever been there we think we've done the right thing and then the word comes along and we say oh I got I got mixed up so if he can do it to me he can do it to you if he can do it to you he can do it to me amen but what happens is when the True Believer sees the word in front of him they humble themselves to the word no matter how much it hurts how much It embarrasses how much it lowers them and they humble themselves to the word and then the word has discerned that they are a True Believer even in their Disobedience they're a True Believer because as soon as they caught the error by the word they go and they humble themselves to it and you see two different groups in this you see Cain remember Cain gave a a a a sacrifice to God outside the garden and Abel gave his sacrifice and God honored it and Cain gave to the best of his knowledge the best of his Revelation the best of his understanding and he gave the best of what he had and God rejected it and remember what God Said to Cain God came down God had a conversation with Cain and he said Cain if you do what Abel did I'll accept you and what did Cain say I'm not interested Cain knew the right and he didn't do it and that's when the word is a discerner amen now you see David on the other hand David the Ark of the Covenant remember I it's not in Jerusalem where he wants it to be and the first time he goes to move it he puts it on an ox cart he doesn't check with the word and then as it's going along the road The Oxen stumble cuz the road is is rough and the Ark starts to slide and oza puts his hand out to steady the ark and God strikes him dead and David was angry that God did that he thought God was unfair but remember what the word said the word said the ark can only be carried by the priests so he neglected to look at the word the word corrected his error and so they left the ark where it was at the at a at a man's house and then months later what did David do he checked the word and the word said the priests have to carry it and so all of a sudden now he takes that and he puts it on the shoulders of the priests and nothing happens see he humbled himself to the word his good intentions cost Aza his life but when he came face to face with the word he humbled himself and he said I'm wrong the word is right and he followed the word from that point on you know I was talking to someone recently and I said we put far too much time into trying to put intentions on people when many times they are simply ignorant the I I I I find this is something that we do too many times I put myself in this group sometimes we put so much effort into saying why somebody's doing it and we have no clue how can we how can we we can't read minds we don't know what's going on in their life and too many times to my own embarrassment I've come on the other side of that situation and I've realized how far off the market I was see we don't have to judge the intentions we can judge the actions by the word and leave it at that and God will discern the hearts amen that's up for him to to to look at amen I am a child of God and you're a child of God and if we are in error God is Duty bound if we're sincere to show us the right amen that's what God's going to do he'll show us the right and he will absolutely teach us and correct us now I we referenced this scripture last service we didn't read it but I want to read it just to close out this little mini thought the morning because I want to remind us as we turn the corner today Jesus said this he says the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father would send in my name he shall do what teach teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you one of the purposes of the holy spirit is to teach us what we need in this life amen that means if we need to be taught that we don't know it all from the start we absolutely do not and I don't care how old you are this morning from Brother Gerald back there to 75 years old to Samuel this morning at four years old or Michael or these young ones we don't know it all and we always have to be led we have to be taught amen that means we're ignorant to start students know don't know everything that's why they have a teacher that knows everything they need to know amen the holy spirit is the teacher and so as we go through life we'll find that sometimes others are ahead of us in class you you know there's some people that are really good at math and they might be a a year behind you but they're way ahead of you in their understanding but there's other people are really good in in science or grammar or writing or or arts and these different things and they're being taught but they have an affinity for it and so they can go faster than other people so we can walk through this life and and maybe you would have a situation in life and you deal with it differently than I would because you're further ahead than I am and I haven't caught up but then we have some keeners amongst us that are just so gung-ho for the for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and they accelerate fast and there's young people maybe that act more appropriate than I do at times in certain circumstances God's dealing with them as individuals and he can grow them and mature them at the pace that he wants to amen but the simple fact is we're all on this path together listen some of you are more mature than I am in some areas and some of them I'm more mature than you even if you're older than me and even if you're younger than me we have a a full spe of Christianity of maturity of growth of strengths here that's what this is all about it's a body some of you are going to be stronger than others in certain areas regardless of age regardless of your background how long you've been serving the lord but we're all learning we're all growing and so it's important we don't assign intentions to people just because they may not be where we are because sometimes that's all it is is they're just not where we are we don't know what we don't know you know I'm facing all sorts of situations these days I've never dealt with and guess what I can't sit there and go by a hunch I've got to go in prayer before God I've got to dig into the word of God to see what it says about how to handle these situations now some things I've learned by watching other men and and sometimes even women in certain circumstances on how to handle things and see God use people in those things but in the end I've got to be growing day by day and I've got to be maturing and God's got to be dealing with me to move through situations and guess what sometimes I make mistakes it's just the it's just the nature of the business amen that when we're put into tough situ ation sometimes we don't get it exactly right but we've got to take it back to the word of God cuz that's what will correct us that's what will teach us that's what will grow us when the Holy Spirit comes down and he quickens it amen that's for free this morning amen now we're going to turn a corner on the spirit of truth because so often we look at truth today if somebody said what is truth we look at it as facts or data or information something that's unbiased but truth is more than that because truth is is Purity it's it's absolute it's right it's perfect amen and it has a very specific per per uh purpose for the Christian amen there's a reason why we run to the word of God even when it doesn't always feel good for us Paul said or Jesus said this in John 8 he says as he spoke these words many believed on him Jesus had many great uh sermons in his ministry but watch what he says here he says then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye do what continue if you continue in my my word then are you my disciples indeed notice it's not who starts that matters it's those that continue all the way to the end that are truly children of God remember what Paul said in the New Testament he says you ran well you were doing so good what did hinder you what stopped you from moving on what stopped you from continuing so often we can sit here and say well I've got a great start I've received the message of this hour I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I've repented of my sins I received the Holy Ghost yes and what have you done since then amen we're supposed to be continuing in the word of God remember the parable of the sewer shows there's a lot of people receive the word but only an elect group goes all the way through to produce the word at the end there's many that receive it with joy there's many that that cultivate it for a while but there's only one group that goes all the way through and produces it and we we see even in the scriptures that Jesus starts with 80 two disciples he picks the 12 and then there's 70 that join themselves to him so he's got 82 and then he preaches a hard sermon and the 70 leave him and then Judas leaves on the on the on the night of the Passover so he's left with 11 out of 82 why those were the only ones that continued in the word but watch what he says if you continue he says if you continue in my word you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now we look back in the law of Moses that people got in trouble at times and they got into a place where they were bound uh into slavery they were Bound by debts and they lost their land their homes their money their inheritance whatever it was and when they got into those troubles they would commit themselves to serving somebody as a slave and that was to pay off their debts or just have somebody to take care of them for until a certain time but there was an event remember every 50 years called The Year of Jubilee and on the Year of Jubilee on that particular particular day at a particular time they would blow a trumpet and as soon as the trumpet was blown every Israelite slave could walk home they could lay down they could their their tools they could walk away from whatever they were doing didn't matter how much their their Master had told them this has to be done today if they didn't get it done it didn't matter because as soon as that trumpet blew they were free to go home they could go home to their family they could go home to their house they could go home to their land their entire inheritance that they got under Joshua could come back to them if they heard the trumpet and responded to it amen it was a reset of the debts of the nation But realize this if they didn't know what the trumpet meant they couldn't go free if that trumpet blew and they said huh I wonder what that's all about and then just went back to hoing guess what they couldn't go free they had to know what the trumpet meant in order for them to be set free amen there was a truth there was a word behind the actions of of that trumpet blower and if they understood what was going on then they could go Free Church do you know why it's so important that we show this world that we don't live the way they do it's to let them know a trumpet's being blown in the land amen you Brothers when you walk away when somebody says do you want to drink we are at a hockey game on on Friday playing hockey that is and the guy said hey there's a cool over there take a beer I said no thanks not interested what am I telling him in my own little way I'm saying a trumpet's been blown you sisters that don't cut your hair that don't wear clothes that pertain to a man what are you saying you're saying a trumpet's been blown you can be set free from these things Brothers when you turn your eyes away from the sensuality of this world and turn your ears away from the dirty jokes and the filthy conversations your your your co-workers your friends have a witness that a trumpet has been blown in the land and you don't have to be bound by those things amen that's what's going on you're you've been set free and you're saying you have to be there either people say how can you go through life without a drink people live for the weekend they live for the alcohol listening to some guys talk in the in the locker room at hockey guy said you know some guy was going on a on a cruise or on a you know an all-inclusive vacation the guy said did you buy the drink package he says that's the first thing I bought free alcohol for the entire time why he's living for the alcohol he doesn't know a trumpet's been blown and you don't have to serve alcohol his Joy is in his what bondage that's all he knows he's been raised the slave he's been raised the slave but we've been set free says this he says see the truth shall make you free Jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come come into condemnation but passed from Death to life he says because he's believed on the Son of God you have to believe it you have to act on it but that slave on that day day or that Year of Jubilee if they refuse to hear the trumpet or if they refused to respond to it what did they do they took him to the doorpost now you got to realize what was on the doorpost before blood the doorpost was Where Mercy was but if you refus to take the mercy if you refused to take the freedom they took you to that place it became a judgment post and they put his ear up against it and they took an all and they just went and they put a hole through his ear and that man could that person could never go free again he couldn't change his mind he had made his choice he turned down Liberty he turned down the trumpet and because of that he had to stay a slave the rest of his life it's the same thing today if you won't hear the gospel you'll stay as slave and it's by choice it's not God's choice it's your choice cuz you refus to heed the trumpet it's a scary thing when we turn down the word it's a scary thing when we turn down the word brother BR says this he says when a man turns down the gospel truth Satan marks him at his ear he deafens him so he can't hear the truth no more and he's finished God have mercy he says he stays with the group that he's with if he won't hear the truth continues in the message Watchman we the night he says you know it's never popular to tell the truth amongst people who want to live live for this present day what it's about the here and now it's about what feels good it's about what makes sense for me today and it's never looking to the Future listen we get 70 years A Little More by reason of strength after that there's a whole lot more waiting for us potentially and we can live this life for the next one or we can live it for this one and if we live it for this present day people aren't going to be very happy with the word of God he says they don't want to believe the truth but the Bible says you shall know the truth I'm so glad of that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free he says now you can be a truth rejecting what prisoner you can be a truth rejecting prisoner or you can know the truth and be free when you hear the gospel you've heard good news that's what gospel means it means good news but if you won't hear the good news all that's left is bad news by definition if you won't hear hear the good news all you got left is bad news amen no one wants to hear bad news ever walk up to somebody say I've got good news and bad news what do you want to hear they say I want to hear the good news but we'll find out as we go through this today we'll see that sometimes the bad news for us is making way for the good news for us sometimes we got to know the bad news before we can know the good news that's really what the gospel does to us now listen to this again we're going to continue in John 8 and remember remember Jesus is not speaking to unbelievers we can as we read the scriptures so many times we can say well he's talking to people that aren't children of God but they're professing Christians if we could put it that way they're professing Believers these are churchgoers these are people that read their Bible these are people that pray these are people that have committed their life to the word of God and watch what Jesus says to them these are faithful people to their religion says they answered him and said cuz remember he say uh if you'll hear the truth of the truth will set you free they answered him said we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free they said we're already free what do you mean we're going to be set free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you who soever committes sin is the servant of sin he says this isn't a natural bondage this is a spiritual bondage and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed I preached on this when I was at brother Ed hammermeister back in September I may preach on it here a little bit later at least in portion but I highly recommend not because I'm recommending my preaching but because it'll give you context if you want to go back and listen to it I called it from victims to Victors and it'll give you some context for this scripture amen but the one thing I want you to catch out of this is when god Set You Free you're really free that word indeed means really and truly so when God set you free when God gives you Liberty you don't have to put it on when you go out the door you don't have to wrap yourself in a cloak of it when you go out you don't have to have this facade it's not a shame it's a work that's done it's finished it's complete amen God's not a god of halfway Works God is a god of a perfect finished work in The Believer amen so it's not something we've got to pretend about if God sets you free then you are free indeed amen I can testify to that of things that I desire before I got the Holy Ghost now I don't desire them I don't I don't think about them I don't crave them I don't look for them I don't feed on them why cuz God is a god of a complete work listen what the scripture says in Deuteronomy he says he is the rock am I the rock are you the rock no he's the rock his work is mediocre pretty good really good no his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment he says a god of Truth and without iniquity just and right is he listen he says he's a god of Truth notice how that ties into his perfect work because what the truth is perfect it's absolute it's righteous it's pure it's clean so we see this truth and this Perfection go together truth is part of the character of God it's the attribute of God all that God does Is Anchored in truth it's anchored in his word which is why it stands a test of time but I want you to catch this this thought I jumped ahead I gave it away because we have our up days and we have our down days don't we three of us five of us and Samuel we have our up days and we have our down days sometimes we think we're in and some days we think we're out sometimes we we we just this may not make sense to the sisters perhaps but there's some days when you're playing sports and you just can't miss it's like brother Bob and corn hole some days it just keeps going in the hole and you're 10t tall and bulletproof in your Christian walk you're just every response is right you're full of love and peace and joy and nothing gets you off you're just walking through life and you're like I've got this I am a child of God and in some days you just want to to go over into your favorite recliner and pull your feet up and stick your thumb in your mouth and just say somebody please help me don't we have days like that where you just don't feel like facing the trial you don't feel like facing the enemy you're sick and tired of being sick and tired but remember we're looking at his work not at our work amen so if we take this sort of thing remember that God doesn't make mistakes God doesn't make mistakes amen God doesn't have children that are worthless God doesn't have children that can't do anything amen the scripture says his work is perfect can you say Amen to his work is perfect his work is perfect if that is true then let's read the next scripture it says for oh we you just said amen to his work is perfect he says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them when you think you're not up to the task when you think you're not strong enough when you think you're not good enough when you think you're not smart enough when you think you don't have this and that and the other when you think the gift isn't there then take Deuteronomy 32:4 and blend it with Ephesians 2:10 and what you come out with is I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me why cuz we are his workmanship I didn't build this up I didn't make this I didn't set this behind a Pulpit I didn't save myself I've said before I wanted to go my own way but we are his perfect workmanship the thing is we're in a period of time remember on the days of creation God said on the first day it was good and God saw that it was good on the second day Third Day fourth day but when he gets to the end is when he says it's very good we're work in progress amen sister you're a good work sister Rebecca you're a good work sister Selena you're a good work sister Justine you're a good work brother Mark you're a very good work he's near the end but here's the thing God's going to get you to the point of his Perfection which means you are exactly what he saw in his mind before the foundation of the world whatever that might be whatever that might be and if you are walking in his will if you're walking in his word you are perfect despite all that this flesh will try and throw up at you day by day amen we are his workmanship amen we are the creation of God we are the Perfection of his hands we are the manifestation of his truth that's what we are this morning amen he built you he formed you and he's teaching you and he's preparing you perfectly for the good works that he's ordained before the foundation of the world that you should do them amen Paul or Jesus said this he says these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs remember he said before there are many things I can't tell you now but when the Holy Ghost comes I'll tell I'll speak through the Holy Ghost later he says but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs but I shall shown you plainly of the father so Jesus always hid his meanings but he says there's coming a time when the meanings won't be hidden I'll show you very plainly and at that day he says you shall ask in my name and I say not un to you that I will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God I came forth from the father and I'm com into the world again I leave the world and go to the father now watch the disciples response the disciples said unto him Lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb they said very good now we are sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from God remember when he'd say something they didn't understand they started talking amongst each other what do you think he means what do you think he means hey will you go ask Jesus what he meant cuz they never understood it now they're saying we don't have to ask each other we know exactly what you're talking about and look at Jesus Jesus kind of claps back he says Jesus answered them do you now believe he's challenging their faith NOW Watch What Happens because remember the spirit of Truth has always been there with them cuz he said remember I am with you and I'll be with in you the Spirit of Truth was always there all along amen they've just said they believe they just said they understand and watch what the spirit of Truth says it says behold the hour cometh Y is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I'm not alone because the father's with me the spirit of truth always says what's true regardless of our feelings it is not bound by our feelings amen the spirit of Truth shows us things to come and here it is speaking already and Jesus says listen you think you believe but there's there's a Time coming very shortly where you're all going to leave me but he never leaves them without Comfort he says these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Listen he says it's going to come and it's going to happen and you're going to fall but don't worry there's overcoming power coming behind amen you're going to have to go through this guys it's coming your way you're not where you think you are but don't worry I've got power coming that'll take you as far as you need to go I want you to see this morning the spirit of Truth can't bend it can't shape itself to what we want it can't compromise for the sake of our feelings our emotions our preferences or our understanding the spirit of Truth is unchanging amen truth can't be Blended or compromised otherwise it can't be truth amen it stands alone we can sit here all day long and say I want the Holy Spirit to have free reign in my life I want it to have full control amen but you have to see that when you happens that when that happens the truth is going to contradict where we are because it's trying to lead us into more and greater and better things so what we have is good but it's trying to take us further in our walk with God Amen many times that's not going to feel very uncomfortable why cuz I'm not an absolute and neither are you and we've got to be shaken off of what we think amen we're not the measuring stick we're not the the ultimate amen we are being led and taught by the Holy Spirit as I said earlier and that means we've got to rise rise from where we are rather than try and drag it down to where we are if we drag truth down to where we are it does us no good whatsoever amen that makes us the absolute David said this in Psalms he says Lead Me in thy truth whose truth thy truth and teach me he says for who is God Thou Art the god of my salvation on Thee I do do I wait all the Day psalm 40 says withhold not thy Tender Mercies from me oh Lord let thy loving kindness we all want loving kindness don't we we love the loving kindness and thy truth see you can't just take the loving kindness you can't take the warmth and the hugs and the the cuddly feelings of Christ without the truth truth he can't split himself like that that's not the way it works you got to get the whole package or none of the package so his loving kindness comes with truth and he says remember what David says here he says he says it's not thy loving kindness that preserves me it's your loving kindness and your truth because if you live by the word if you live within the lines that the word lays out you'll be kept safe because now you're hiding in him rather than in your own way amen he says th loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve me that means you got to stay in the truth to be continually preserved can't just have it for a day it's got to be an everyday walk amen those are beautiful scriptures and they ought to be our hearts cry every single day Lord lead me in thy loving kindness and thy truth cuz that's what's going to keep me safe amen but the test for that is when the Holy Spirit comes down through the word of God and we're found wanting and the question is what are we going to do with it then what are we going to do when we're found wanting amen when we're living than what he says and we're left with a choice do we humble ourselves to the spirit of Truth or do we create our own truth that allows us to stay where we are that's what so many people want today is they want to stay where they are but be comforted and you can't get that from Christ because his loving kindness comes with his truth his comfort comes with his truth remember we're speaking on the spirit of Truth this morning and Jesus was talking with his disciples and remember he had that conversation he says who who does who does the world say I am what does everybody think I am who do they think I am and they gave their answers and then and then he asked them the same thing and the scripture says he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Peter gave the perfect answer the perfect answer and Jesus Remember the spirit of Truth speaking now answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Peter gives a perfect answer and the spirit of truth comes right behind and says that's right now notice he says I'm going to build my church on that not on Peter I'm going to build it on the revelation of Jesus Christ amen but watch how the spirit of Truth keeps rolling here he says I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven so the spirit of Truth is confirming Peter's Revelation Peter got a Heavenly Revelation a spiritual Revelation and he confirms that it's right and correct and I can imagine Peter was having his 10-ft tall and bulletproof moment Peter's like I've got it I've got it I know who he is and he's probably saying hallelujah praise the Lord what a meeting we would love to have a meeting like this wouldn't we where God's coming down he's saying booy you're just you're on it you know it you got it you got it you're right you're right you're right we'd love that says then charged he his disciples that he should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ and from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day so the meeting switches from an affirmation of Peter lining up with the word to now the what what is it the spirit of Truth is showing them things to come okay watch this same man watch what happens then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee so Peter kind of comes over Jesus and he kind of just brings him over says no this isn't for you don't do this he's trying to correct the spirit of Truth watch what the spirit the truth says but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men and the Amplified says you are a stumbling block for me for you are not setting your mind on the things of God but on the things of man so Mr keys to the kingdom of God Peter went from being a blessed man that has a keys to the kingdom to being of Satan and offensive to God according to the spirit of Truth he goes from Mr inspirational Mr Revelation to stumbling block and carel like that and what does the spirit of Truth does do Spirit of Truth spoke to him in both those situations and the first it affirms him because he's with the word and the second one it what correct him because he's caught up in his flesh amen the spirit of truth will call us by the word he's not there to to Pat you on the shoulder and say good job all the time if you want to know how to raise your kids look at how the Holy Spirit works with the believer it is corrective in love it affirms when you do right and it corrects when you do wrong by the word of God Amen so the spirit of truth always always confirms the word not the person and when you're with the word then that's fine amen it can't do anything else because it's truth it's an absolute it cannot change yeah Peter was always getting himself caught up in these situations if you notice Peter was Mr enthusiasm he was Mr passionate he was gung-ho he had all the fire and brimstone in him Peter was going to go get him Peter was going to make it all the way Peter was Mr reliable Mr I'm going to make it all the way through and sometimes he was right on point and sometimes he was was completely caught up in his flesh but I love how the spirit of truth always encourages the true child of God look at what Jesus has to say this amen Jesus was hard on him at times but watch watch how he comes back to encourage him and the Lord said on said Simon Simon Pete Pete Pete buddy he says Satan has desired to have you that he may he may sift you as wheat hey Church we're all in a battle it's no different for you than Peter no different for me than Peter amen we're all in a battle and it's a battle between God and Satan he says Satan's trying to just get you blown away he says but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not there's our encouragement and then the spirit of truth comes behind and he says and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren sort of a mixed signal here Pete you got some work to do but I prayed for you there's the encouragement I prayed for you there's going to be a way to made through and when thou art converted so we got to take the good with the bad he's got to acknowledge I'm not converted yet but Jesus is saying you're going to be converted and when you're converted when you receive the spirit of truth then use it to help other people there's a there's a door opening up Pete and you're going to walk through it I'll get you through the door but there's going to be some hard times between now and then and Peter comes back he says said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death passion and enthusiasm were Peter's Hallmarks before his conversion but was what he said true because the spirit of truth will tell us if it's true or not and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before that thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me see the spirit truth comes right back and says buddy you don't have what you think you have you don't have it and it's going to prove itself out but when the word of God is cutting church when it's personal and specific that's the time we ought to praise him all the more because if you want a confirmation that you're a child of God it's when the word corrects not judges Judas it judged Judas it judged Peter it corrected Peter it corrected amen the greatest confirmation you can have on a daily basis is that the word corrects you rather than judges you amen and it keeps coming back brother Braham now speaking of the son being brought into adoption he says now when this son began to come to school age this tutor would go with this son and stay with him and bring messages to the father how the son was progressing if the son was dilatory not about the father's business then how that tutor must be ashamed to walk up in the face of the father and say sir I'm sorry to say but your son is not do doing too well he just won't learn he doesn't care he says well then God when he left the Earth here his church he selected a tutor for his church he got a razor someone who would be honest who would bear the truth the right kind of a razor he said it wasn't some Archbishop or Pope or general overseer he sent the Holy Ghost to be the overseer and the tutor of the church he says but we adopted Bishops and everything else to be tutors of the church it isn't God's program the holy spirit is our teacher the holy spirit is the tutor of the church we've adopted every kind of an idea all kinds of schools and theologies and everything when the Holy Ghost ought to be leading us then he says this statement now that's the reason why the church is in the condition it is tonight it's being man Le and not spirit-led matter what scripture says sons of God are led by the spirit of God the defining feature one of them of a child of God is that they're led by the spirit he says Sons and Daughters you got it right here Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God the spirit of God is to lead the church now catch this last bit he says now man might say anything cuz why we want your money we want to influence you we want to have power we want to have control we want to have a big church we want to have people give us accolades we want to build up a big reputation men will say anything okay he said but the the holy spirit will tell the truth on you we're speaking on the spirit of Truth amen we've read it before that the the scripture says that Christ is a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he knows how it feels to be in flesh he knows the struggle he knows the hardship but that doesn't mean he bends or shapes the word to give us leeway never he always brings us up to the standard not brings the standard back down to us Amen in other words he can't do that because he'd be a liar and a deceiver if it changes based on us then it's not truth and God has lied when he gave us his word so the Holy Spirit won't come down and just say oh I know you're just that way it's okay we're just going to let that go no the holy spirit will show you the word and it'll say there's power in the word if you'll just line up if you'll humble yourself and say Lord I see where I'm not there and I see where the word is I'm asking you to raise me to that level then he'll do it but too often what we're doing is we're trying to get to coddle us and let us stay where we are rather than saying Lord Lift Me Up set me on a higher plane amen yes this holy spirit is a comforter and we'll preach on that soon Lord willing maybe even on Wednesday night but the Comfort we have is not that he comes down and gives us a hug the Comfort we have is that he doesn't change we change the comforter changes us not himself amen the word never changes us amen that's why the the world is so the religious world is so messed up is that they've taken the word and they've changed it to suit themselves and in doing so they've taken the power completely out of it how can something have power if you make it work according to your will instead of its own it can't do it there there there's no power in it amen Jesus said that the people by their Traditions have made the word of God ineffective he says you've added to your religion you've taken things that make you feel spiritual that make you feel saved that make you feel good and you've made the word of God completely ineffective why cuz we've compromised it with our own ideas our own spirituality and it led the people of Israel down a road of tremendous religious fervor and it took them completely into apostasy Christ came and they didn't they didn't recognize the word because they'd gone so far in their own religion they'd left the word behind and they couldn't receive it amen but I want to take for the last 30 minutes maybe of this service this morning this idea of the spirit of Truth and bring it down into our time and our season because we see in the Book of Revelation that the spirit of Truth acts exactly like I've spoken about it will tell the truth on you amen it'll give you the good and it'll give you the bad why because the word stands absolute and it's comparing you to the word so if we look at in Revelation 2 And1 this is speaking remember there's seven Church ages seven Gentile Church Church ages starting with the Ephesian Church age uh which was Paul's time and coming all the way up to the seventh Church age which is today and in Revelation 2:1 it says I skipped that he says that's what we want is the truth regardless of where it hurts circumcises or who it cuts off we want the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen we want to be changed rather than stay as we are so he says in Revelation 2:1 now he's speaking to the seven Gentile Church ages this is the first one Paul's age he says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so he's saying speak to the angel speak to the messenger in the in in Revelations 2 and 3 these seven Church ages the angel is speaking of a literal messenger and if you look in Revelations 1 remember he has a seven stars in his hands and he says those are the seven angels the seven Messengers The Seven men to the seven Church ages so who is the Angel who was the messenger to the first church age it was the Apostle Paul amen he was the prophet to the age and he established gospel truth above him Beyond everyone else even Peter had to acknowledge Paul's gospel remember what Paul said if anyone including me preaches anything other than what I brought to you already let that person be a cursed right I've said it before but it's funny how the Catholic Church picks Peter as the first pope but Peter was corrected by Paul if you're going to pick a pope it should have been Paul cuz he had the word for the day but we know a pope is wrong anyways there is no such thing it was never put in there amen we see here that the preeminence is always for the Holy Spirit the one walking in the church not for the messenger himself amen but it's it's always the holy spirit that has the preeminence for us that's where we find our leadership Abraham says this he says The Great I Am the almighty God has come as Spirit to fill his true church he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy man amongst us but the whole true Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because of the presence of the Holy Spirit he says it is he the holy spirit that is Holy not the congregation of itself they call a pope Holy Father and guess what there's only one holy and that's God and there's only one father and that's our father in Heaven scripture says you're not supposed to call any man father and ain't one of us holy so they they they've got him doubly damned by calling him a Holy Father he can never match up to that amen man we don't raise up men but remember in Revelations 2:1 this is John on the AL of pus patmas this is 860 70 maybe maybe even 80 Paul's dead and it's saying write to the angel write to the messenger and tell him to preach this but Paul's already preached so that means you can find what he's talking about here in Paul's message already in the gospels of the New Testament not in the gospels but in the books that he wrote in the New Testament so this message that he's giving in Revelation 2:1 to the Church of Ephesus is not so much to Paul CU Paul's already received his message but this is for the people that are living under Paul's message even though Paul's gone it's reminding the people of their obligation to the word amen it's reminding them of the word that they've received and so now the the the the spirit of God is speaking to them and it says I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and H how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and hasth not fainted so this is the first church age and the spirit of Truth Now is acknowledging all that they've done is good and right he God will absolutely encourage us and affirm us when we do what the word tells us to do and they had done these things according to the word that they' received from Paul but now he comes to verse four and he says nevertheless but I have somewhat against the I've got a little thing against you because thou Hast left thy first love so the spirit of truth comes and he gives them all the encouragement families parents if you want to know how to encourage your children and correct them look at what God does he comes and he gives you the good news news and then he gives you the correction behind it we can't always be doing this we got to build our kids up and then we correct them behind it amen it's a good thing to follow but remember the spirit of Truth has to tell the whole story it has to give us the full picture amen they put God aside they left their first love and something else had the preeminence and so what do they do remember the spirit of truth will tell you the error but it will give you the remedy to the error as well here's the remedy he says remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen in other words they'd had it before they were living right they were living by the word God had preeminence he says remember from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first work so he says go back repent of where you're at go back and do what Paul told you to do which is let the Holy Spirit have control of the church get the men get the Traditions away it's not that God doesn't use men we'll talk about it in a second but he's saying get away from religion and get back to Christ that's really what he was saying or else see there's the remedy but there's judgment or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent he says you won't receive eternal life he says but this thou Hast comes back he says you got to get things fixed you got to make it right or else but then he says but you still got something he says Thou hatest the Deeds of the nicadan which I also hate now here's the spirit of Truth he's commending them again for standing up the nickan which was the men that wanted control of the church for their own purposes then he finishes in verse 7 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and here's the promise to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God so this is John writing but who is speaking it's not John it's the holy spirit it's not Paul it's the holy spirit amen it's using Paul to give the message but it's the spirit of God that's giving the message now watch what brother Braham says about this he's talking about the the what they did right in the book of EP in in the Ephesian church he he says Thou Hast tried them that say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars he says my that's a blunt statement thou H has tried them who call themselves apostles who call themselves believers who call themselves ministers who call themselves by these things that get them influen he says isn't that presumptuous what right has a people to try those who call themselves Apostles do you as the lady have a right to judge the ministry according to the scriptures you absolutely do and you must it's one of the things that held them he says do and how do they try them oh I love this he says here it is in Galatians 1:8 though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that which we have already preached unto you let him be ACC cursed he says it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a DOT or dash of it Paul knew it was God who had spoken it to him so he said even if I come Paul put himself in the same box as everyone else and said even if I come and try and give a second Revelation try and make one little change in what I gave originally let me be accursed you see Paul knew that first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation and then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he says now he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David he says but it was the same Revelation he never changed it it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it he says but God's word can't change the same the seed came exactly as was revealed he says hallelujah he says now here's what those see what the false apostles were doing they came with their own word what they scripture says that they would he the people would Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears people that would tell them what they want wanted but what these men were coming in they were they were called in scripture wolves and sheep's clothing they came in pretending to be Believers pretending to be Christians but they came in to destroy and devour and use the people of God for their own benefit and so they came with their own word that was calculated to benefit them rather than you I've got to preach the word for you not for me it's for me I'm with you don't don't get me wrong but I can't get up here and preach a word that benefits me while hurting you that would make me a wolf in sheep's clothing and that's what they did they came with a word that would hurt the people that would bind the people to them rather than free them by the word binding them to men and we see it today he says the those Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false wow he says oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it's not you that really tries the Apostle and the prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them remember like I said we're not here to judge people we're here to stay with the word and then they choose do I stay with it or do I walk away from it I've talked many times about the things that happened in our little church in Texas how that Pastor had fallen away was living a double life while still ministering and fooled so many of us for so long and you know it would be easy in those circumstances to blame the man and believe me he carries blame he willingly fooled us he willingly lived a double life but when I go back in the scripture those people always are proven out anyways it's going to come out no matter what their fruits come out amen but it's easy to point to that man and say well he fooled us but the thing I always asked myself or the thing I asked myself after that was if I've got the holy ghost in my life and I did and I do how did he fool me I don't care how he fooled anyone else I ask how did he fool me cuz there's error there if the Holy Spirit does not discern there's error if the word doesn't discern what's going on there's a problem and so I asked myself how did this happen amen the holy spirit is the discerner in our midst by the word of God and when I looked at my decisions around that man I found multiple times where I did not hold him accountable to the word of God period amen if I did he would have had to make a clear choice of stay with the word or go his own way and he would have proved what he was right there but I was being nice I was being kind I was being courteous I was being accommodating amen he was a good friend of mine I appreciated his ministry I appreciated his gift I didn't want to have the difficult conversation I was a deacon I should have had the difficult conversation I failed in my duty in that but what happened was I put out the discernment of the word to maintain relationship that's that that's the truth and so that's not God's fault that's my fault amen I had no one to blame but myself because I had given that man that Ministry the preeminence over the word of God looking back hindsight all the signs were there all the proof was there but I was blinded because I put away the word for the sake of maintaining relationship for the sake of having a pastor continue there in these different things what was I wanting to do I didn't want to judge the man but we're not here to judge the man but we are here to hold each other accountable to the word amen there's accountability in a body of group in a body of people I didn't want to have the difficult conversation so that I could Corner him to where he'd have to make a clear-cut decision am I for or am I against the word of God Amen but remember I'm not here to judge you you're not here to judge me what you hear is you're you're there to lay down the word and say what are you going to do with it that's it it's so simple what will you do with the word says no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public how gracious he is to his fellow men doing nothing but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God Amen have we seen it I've seen people hate me without without a reason without a reason he says not that they couldn't find a reason but hated me from the get-go why I have something they don't have and that means we're in Conflict he says and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life can we say amen he says there is only one thing you can do about them when somebody does you wrong when you know that you know that you know I don't deserve what they're doing what do we do go all Bruce Lee on them right bring down become the sons of thunder right fire and brimstone shall be thy portion that's what we do he says there is only one thing you can do about it Church remember we are under a mercy Covenant as long as we are here our ministry is come and drink of the Waters of Life freely we're sounding a trumpet which is what Liberty the next trumpet is Judgment for then the next trumpet's judgment there's liberty while we're here once the bride leaves in the resurrection and the Rapture it's judgment judgment judgment we are the only thing that's holding back judgment this morning so our every response is Mercy every single time there's only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and their outworking and final judgment to him we had an event happen in our home this week and I won't go into details but somebody outside did something wrong to somebody inside and you know what we can sit here and we can say I'm a Child of God they're going to get it and you know what that is church that's the flesh that's the Flesh and I'll tell you I've had all sorts of things going through my mind I'm not dumb I'm like I I'm pretty sure I can get this person and never get caught and you know what it is it's Satan trying to get you worked up about not something that is not remotely worth a person's soul right I've had this happen many times because what righteous indignation Rises up and Satan will take it and he'll turn it into anger and judgment rather than the mercy and Grace of the holy spirit for that person amen hey I'm still dealing with this thing this flesh wants judgment but when it's my turn what do I ask for Mercy grace mercy and Grace come on God give me another chance come come on Amen I want Mercy but God helped me to give it to somebody else the flesh never wants to do that that's why we need the spirit inside of us Amen to give Mercy when there is no reason to give it we give it because it's still available amen Jesus made it very clear how to know who is and is not a child of God he says why do you not understand my speech he's speaking to these priests even because you cannot hear my word they could literally hear it but they couldn't understand it or receive it or accept it amen it's not coming to church that makes us Christians amen it's accepting the word of God personally that makes us a Christian he says ye are of your this is the spirit of Truth speaking now we're speaking on the spirit of Truth ye are of your father the Devil he's speaking to the Ministry Church ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he's a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not why cuz they're tuned to believe a lie cuz they're Children Of Satan he says which of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words remember what Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow it's that simple he says ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God that's a spirit of Truth speaking it couldn't lie to them to make them feel good about themselves it called them out amen it gave them the evidence by which they know they are True Believers when we read in Revelations 2 and 3 of all those messages and in Revelation 2 it goes down it does three Church ages or four Church ages and then in Revelation 3 comes down and does the next on all the way through seven and then at the end of every message to every Church it says the line he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches we're talking about the spirit of Truth this morning and if we look at that then how did the Holy Spirit speak to the to the first church age through Paul yes it spoke through Peter and James and these different ones the apostles and whatnot but it brought the word through Paul amen it was Paul's message alone that was guaranteed to be true everyone else had to line up with that because it was Paul that was taught it by the Holy Spirit on the backside of the desert remember Paul when he was converted he says immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood he says immediately I didn't go to men I didn't go to Ministries I didn't go to the disciples I didn't go to the apostles in other words he didn't go get somebody else's Revelation but the Holy Spirit took him out on the backside of the desert for years in Arabia and it gave him the Gospel of Jesus Christ as we read it today in the New Testament and so the Holy Spirit spoke expressly through Paul and then what happened then is the five-fold ministry of that day right it's not just a prophet You' got youve you got the evangelists and you got the the pastors and the teachers and the different ones they all come down and they start preaching the same thing Paul preached remember what Paul said to Timothy Paul was giving his message to Timothy and then he said Timothy commit this message to Faithful Men and they'll say the same things you're saying which is the same thing I'm saying and the Holy Spirit can continue to lead the People by the word of Truth amen so we nobody else could change that gospel because it wasn't Paul's gospel it was the Gospel of Jesus Christ given to him by the Holy Spirit it came through Paul but it wasn't Paul's it was God's message and that message can't change it and so we can't undo it and we can't change it because everything else changes around us that's where we're at today amen because standards have changed society's change what's acceptable is change listen we got people living common law and thinking that it's okay scripture clearly says you can't do it there's all sorts of things we're doing today not us by God's grace but people are doing today and even going to church and sitting there and thinking they're okay when the word says you can't do it you're not allowed to do it the Holy Spirit the spirit of truth will take us back to Paul's original message or it isn't the holy spirit amen God can't change so his word and his message can never change but as we close let's go to our age the seventh age the leoan church age do we want to hear the truth we want the truth amen the message for every age is to the professing believer it's not for the unbeliever it's not for the atheist it's for the churchgoer the Bible reading person it's for the professing Christian the person that hears the word okay so let's read what R says and unto the angel of the Church of the leans now remember leod deia means people's rights so unto the angel of the Church of the people's rights WR these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now notice who he is it's always Perfection he says the amen the amen means so be it he says he's the faithful and true witness now faithful and true witness always means thus saith the Lord because there's only one thing that never fails and that's the word of God so when he says he's the faithful and true Min uh uh witness it always means it's a prophetic Ministry it's a son of man Ministry not just a messenger so the first one was a a prophet messenger that means the last Church age messenger has to be a prophet as well because it's the faithful and true witness it's thus sayith the Lord he says I Know Thy works okay this is our age now that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot the leosan church age this last Church age this final Church age our time today is the only one that the Holy Spirit couldn't say a good thing about church we're living in darkness we are living in a time of the absolute pinnacle of sin and unbelief remember scripture says it'd be a gross Darkness but it says in the evening time there' be light the word of God will come how by a prophetic Ministry but he says I know you're you're lukewarm how many here would you know come over to my house and say brother John what I'd really love is a glass of lukewarm water nobody says it they either want it cold or they want it hot right maybe dip some tea in it if it's hot if it's cold maybe whatever nobody's asking for lukewarm water nobody loves it verse 16 so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth ever have a water bottle left in your car when it's sunny out and when you left it was pretty good you came back an hour later and you go and take a swig and you just want to do what he says it's gross it's gross now remember everything in the scripture when it comes to Revelation 2 and 3 is spiritual it's not just physical some of it does match up with physical for sure but it's spiritual so he's talking about spiritual lukewarmness and how do you get spiritually lukewarm there's only one way compromise compromise you've got to blend the word with something else but watch now what happens when they start blending see they thought they improve their condition when they did it we're not stupid we do things that we think will make life better for us but just because we think it's better doesn't mean it is better and what we've produced now is is compromise now look at the effect of this verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing so their their confession their testimony is I am spiritually rich I have all the gifts I don't need anything now here's God here's the spirit of Truth coming down and he says and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked so remember the spirit of our age is religious self-deception amen we're in an age of people's rights and the right of Christians today is to shape the word to match where they're at rather than let their lives be shaped by the word itself amen their right is to sit in church Church in any condition they want to be in where the word has no effect and yet they are somehow going to eternal life and they're somehow Christlike even though they don't follow the word of God Amen it's delusions of spiritual leadership and blessing and what happens when you think that you when when you put away the word and you match the word to yourself rather than the other way around you make yourself the absolute and that builds Pride it builds Pride every single time because hey if I get to sent the standard I'm going to make myself the standard and if I'm the standard nobody's better than me sister Justine good luck try and sis you're not going to do it right and so now it's I'm better than everybody else my church is better than everyone else my Ministry is better than everyone else me me me me me I've got it all and you guys don't have it and then you've got your own little church and you've got your own little church and your own little this that the other thing and all of a sudden it is just pride pride pride and the Hallmark of Satan in your life is pride remember what he said at the beginning I will Ascend I will I will I will I will what do Paul tell us to do if the Lord Wills if the Lord Wills Lord willing I'll do this Lord see he was lifted up in Pride and what you have here is a people that are so caught up in themselves they can't see their real spiritual condition but it never leaves us without hope it never leaves us with without hope the spirit of truth will always bring a remedy and even this horrible Fallen church that God had nothing good to say about he still said I'll give you a way out of this let me say this morning I don't care where you are in your walk with God there's a way made listen you could be living a secret double life and I wouldn't know about it I've know many people did it for years but God knows and if that's where you're at he can set you free he always makes a way of escape to the True Believer here it is Verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rayment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see now we preached on this before I'm not going to spend time on it this morning but what is gold tried in the fire you'll notice this is the only one you have to buy you have to buy this because it's Godly character proven through trials and testing and as a child of God you can choose to go in or you can choose to pull back you got to choose to go through the trial listen God can lay something in front of you and you can take you can short circuit it time and time again and yes you'll keep going around the mountain you'll never progress but you've got to pay a price for this one because you got to lay yourself down you got to let his character be made made real in you and let everything else of you get beaten out that white reignment is God's righteousness rather than our self-righteousness we've got to Humble ourselves you have you ever seen these things they've got these t-shirts that say Only God can judge me nobody's seen them they've got these things now saying Only God can judge me usually alternative lifestyle people let me say this you don't want to wait for God to judge you the word is here with Mercy why would you ask for judgment when mercies here God forbid we say Only God can judge me yes only God can judge you you don't want to wait to that point he sent a message of mercy and Grace and forgiveness take it otherwise he'll judge you and it's not going to end well but then look at this last one it says isav that you can see and the only way you can get there is repentance because this is something that only God can show you and what it is is when the word is brought to you you can see your real condition and you realize I'm not what I thought I was and so repentance brings humility which puts you out of the way and it allows God to start showing you the reality of your life and your situation amen repentance always brings humility because it requires us to lay down our thoughts our ideas our way of looking at things verse 19 as many as I roll out as many as I love I rebuke and chasen Hallelujah thy rod and th staff they comfort me he says be zealous therefore and repent what's the Zeal of this final Church age you want to know somebody's a zealous Christian what do they do they repent they repent they turn around they confess and ask forgiveness and they walk in the light of the original word not with their denomination preaches but in the light of the original word forsake the denominations forsake their tradition of man forsake religion and come to Christ the word that's what he's trying to get him to do look at verse 20 he says behold I stand at the door and knock he's outside the church Christ is completely outside the church now he doesn't say if any men he says if any man hear my voice it's an individual Affair now he says if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me see he's outside the church that means you're not getting in by Church attendance by affiliation with some group you've got to meet with Christ the person amen and he always comes and reveals himself through his word through the original word of God then he always gives the great reward he says to him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne listen doesn't give a prize if nobody's going to win it do you ever you ever go to the fair sometimes and they have these things I know when I was at the the Bellingham Fair down in uh in Washington one time they had uh the military was recruiting and so they set up these these tall uh horizontal bars and if you can hang on them for 2 minutes then they'll give you a 100 bucks ever try and hang by for two minutes by your sweaty Palms on a steel bar few people can do it there is a trick to it but most people can't what are they trying to do they're trying to get a chance to talk to you the prize isn't there because they think someone's going to win it it's there to get people in God doesn't do that God gives a prize because there's a people ordained to win it there's a people ordained to get it he says you're going to sit with me in my throne even as I also am set down with my father in his throne he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches remember the spirit of Truth is always thus saith the Lord it's perfect it's point there is no if Sands or buts it is direct it is clear you see so many people today remember the the real gift is already come and gone and so people are coming behind it with all these gifts of Prophecy and it is so vague I could do it so vague why because it is not the spirit of God it's a spirit of confusion it's a spirit of influence it's a spirit of Satan trying to mimic what God's trying to do and what God's already done and they come down they do these things but that the spirit of Truth is always thus sayeth the Lord remember what the scripture says in the Book of Revelation it says the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy in other words what brings the gospel is what a spirit of Prophecy God always works through prophets it always comes by prophets it always has and it always will remember John the prophet John the Revelator on the aisle of patmas he's a prophet Christ was foran by a prophet Christ himself was a prophet he called himself I'm the son of man Paul's a son of man and then John the Revelator on the aisle of patmas and there's an angel talking to him and he goes to worship that angel and what is the Angel say don't worship me worship God I am of your brothers the prophets so God even in the Heavenly realm was using a prophet to reveal the word that's what the Spirit of Truth is it's a spirit of Prophecy showing you things to come it's the reality of the word for your time and for your season amen so that angel said don't worship me I know you think I'm God because I know all these things but it's not me I've just been given a message and I'm just sharing with you what he told me one last quote he says one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the lean Church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from God or not how he says yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota he says in that last age when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene see they're pointing to themselves he says but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he has ch that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you or lost he says he won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation but on the word amen and amen amen God bless you let's stand if we would I was thinking this morning just about the ministry of that prophet and when you look at so many others you look at people like Oral Roberts in particular and some of these great faith healers that followed that Ministry and whatnot what did they do they built up this massive following and they built up universities and big headquarters and multi- multi-million dollar Ministries and all these great things and whatnot and what did he have he had a little trailer with somebody with a typewriter and that's what God was using for the age he could have had Mill millions and millions and millions of dollars and every time he turned it down because he knew it came with strings attached what was he saying get back to the word he never pointed to himself he didn't want anything he said get back to the word get that token life get the Holy Spirit get away from your church get away from your denominations get away from your Creeds get away from your ideas you don't have what you think you have come back to the word and the word will set you free and he showed what it meant to be a free Son of God Amen that's where we're at that's why we believe this message that's why we believe an end time Prophet has come and gone is because we've seen the effect of it by the word of God not just by emotions not just by feelings and Sensations hey we love to have a good time in church but that's not where it starts and that's not where it ends amen it's the word living inside of us that is the end of all end all and be all in our lives amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord It's Your Truth that sets us free Lord and what a struggle it can be in this flesh sometimes to go the way that this world would tell us to go to manage Our lives our finances our relationships Lord even a church Lord according to what would seem best and reasonable and logical but Lord our rest is in your word your unchanging word day by day Lord for we have seen the power that lies in it if we will just stay with it Lord I pray that we take our lives and run them today through the filter of your word Lord and where we see things that won't fit through that filter Lord that we'd let them go Lord I pray that you'd set us free from our own minds our own thinking our own opinions Lord even the emotions that cloud our judgment so many times Lord I pray that you'd help us to just sit back lord to not do anything too hastily Lord to rest on your word Lord let us not go to judge but Lord let us go and hold all things according to your word Lord commit each one into your hands Lord and move on in Grace Lord in the light that you've shown us each one I pray Lord lead us guide us Lord I need it we need it more than ever heavenly father it's a gross Darkness out there but you promised us that in the evening time there shall be light Lord we're trusting we have that light this morning Lord and that it's your revealed word the same thing that Paul preached as what we're preaching this morning Lord God though it's unpopular though it hurts this flesh Lord though it causes Lord disruptions in our families and relationships perhaps at times Lord we're trusting that it's all for our good Lord and it brings us to a certain end Lord give us Faith Lord give us strength give us courage give us boldness Lord give us also Lord help us to be wise as serpents as harmless as doves in this word we pray Lord make us a witness Lord Jesus day by day Lord we want to testify we want to show that a trumpet's been blown Lord that we can can go free Lord and everyone that hears your word can go free as well Lord set us free this morning I pray in a greater way than we've ever had in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen pour your spirit out on me
