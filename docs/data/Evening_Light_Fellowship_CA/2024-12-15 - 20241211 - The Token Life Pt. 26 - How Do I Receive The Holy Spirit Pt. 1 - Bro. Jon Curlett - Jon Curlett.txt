cleansed us from our sin at Calvary Lord when you shed your blood and you washed us white as snow heavenly father but Lord that was just a start Lord for under that precious blood resides every promise Lord for healing of every sickness every concern every worry every stress Lord for every need we have it's all been supplied Lord and we're here to thank you this morning we're here to confess Lord that we believe it that we accept it Lord that we're trusting you Lord for everything that ails these bodies Lord we know we have a promise of healing not a promise that we'll never get sick Lord but we've got a resurrection power inside Us by the Holy Spirit Lord that'll change these bodies in a moment and a twinkling of an eye Lord and we'll be caught up to meet with you in the air Lord that's the great healing we're looking for but Lord in the meantime Lord we're trusting your word we're trusting your spirit Lord to move in our lives Lord to give us what we have need of Lord to encourage us and straighten us out this morning Lord to help us just put one foot in front of the other Lord to keep on that path Lord to eternal life we pray Lord I pray you just speak to us this morning Lord Lord I pray you fill ones with your spirit this morning Lord that you would refill those that have gotten dry this morning as well we pray Lord grant us a touch we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ezekiel 36 this morning Ezekiel 36 and 24 amen good to see each one back good to see sister Becky back with us again amen God bless you amen good to see brother Chad here but we want to keep remembering brother or sister Leah and the family homesick today praying Grace especially for little Joshua with the whooping cough and they're dealing with pneumonia and all these things is brother the Jad told me yesterday new levels new Devils amen so it's the battle never ends amen but we've been assured of Victory amen we want to remember brother Grant as well he's working this morning I talked to him yesterday but he's had exams this last week and he's got one more this week and then he'll get a break for a few weeks so we thank the Lord for that but just praying Grace for him to get through that as well brother Bob and sister Brenda will also leave on Thursday to go to Alberta Alberta in the winter you must have somebody there you love because otherwise you wouldn't go no offense to my my brothers and sisters from Alberta that might be listening this morning but we pray God will be with them give them a break certainly take our greetings to brother Jerry and and uh sister Debbie and the Church there and of course brother Adam and sister uh Jamie and the family there as well amen you can see I'm in glasses this morning just a minor irritation in my eye but I'm just abundance of caution I guess try not to aggravate it so Paul had a thorn in his flesh that seems to be mine these days so you keep me in your prayers just trusting the Lord that he is my healer amen amen God bless you Ezekiel 36 and 24 he says for I will take you from among the Heathen gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and maybe you'd think this would be one we'd start this series with and I want to speak on how do I receive the Holy Spirit but you know sometimes we don't know we need to receive it there's been a lot of teaching there's been a lot of preaching about the Holy Spirit and how do you get it and how do you know you have it and people have messed it up to such a point that they don't know if they're coming or going if they're in or they're out if they're saved if they're not they don't know where they're at and so they they have church experiences and they have Camp experiences and all these different things and they don't know if they've got the Holy Spirit or not and so we've got to know how do you receive it and we've got to know what it means when you receive it we've got to know uh the the proof that you've received it and so I'm going to teach this very tightly this morning I don't believe it'll be a preaching service it'll be a teaching service but I want to say and started with this there's a lot of people that think they have the Holy Ghost and they don't and I don't say that as a judgment or as a criticism by any means amen but I speak that because the word tells us that and we'll get into that a little bit this morning but the condition of the Rel of the the latest and church age is religious self-deception and that's a people that believes that they're rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing spiritually they think they have it all and the scripture says you don't know that you're miserable poor wretched blind and naked they don't have anything that God requires of them and so we've got a world that's a Christian world that's created their own standards to make themselves comfortable with where they're at so that they don't have to change and they think in all of that because they're happy and they're satisfied that they have the Holy Spirit and nothing could be further from the truth and I'm not talking about the world out there I'm talking about the message and then don't ever think that this is outside this is something we have to look at internally because we have people that believe that they have the Holy Spirit because they recognize a prophet in this age we have people that believe because they know the Seven Seals are open that they've got the Holy Spirit we've got people that believe that because they sit under a particular Ministry they have the Holy Spirit because they go to a particular Church they have the Holy Spirit because they go to a message Church they have the ho Holy Spirit and I'm not saying they don't have the Holy Spirit but I'm saying those are not the reasons why you have the holy spirit amen so we've got all sorts of ideas that to make us comfortable and make us think we're going to make it amen but there's only one way to receive the Holy Spirit and it's simple it's time tested and it's available today amen it's it's it's never changed amen it doesn't change with time if God gives it to one person one way he has to give it to the other person the same way he can't change it because we're in a different time and season it's all the same way but I want to start with us in Ezekiel because this is the promise of the giving of the spirit one of the prophecies that God gave regarding the pouring out of his spirit and and the starting point is in Ezekiel 36:25 he says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your Idols will I cleanse you the starting point to receive the holy spirit is to recognize your condition you have to recognize that this is the the one of the the the the key prophecies regarding when God was going to pour out his spirit and it starts with a people that are filthy and worshiping Idols now today we don't tend to look at idol worship the way they did back then back then they had other gods they would make them out of stone or clay or or some sort of metal or gold whatever it might be and we don't have that in North American culture today we don't have people that prop up typically something in their house or they go to a church and they have a statue there unless you're Catholic maybe but you go to India and they have that you go to Africa and they might have that you go to China and you go to Japan they may have an idol that they worship but we don't have those things but we know that an idol is anything that is worshiped it's an object of worship and so it can be something or it can be someone that you give special attention to from your time from your money from your energy from your attention it's something that you place a lot of value in and it's something that you seek out to place in Pre Ence in your life and so we have all sorts of Idols today and I'm not going to SP spend a bunch of time but if you're out in the world some people's Idol is drinking and they they they live to drink they put their money to drink whatever they have left over at the end of the week or the end of the month that goes into drinking for some people it's partying for some people it's carousing for some people it's racing cars for some people it's sledding for some people it's skiing and all they live for is to do that one thing and what is it it's an idol in their life amen but we can have religious Idols as well we can have people that live to go to church to speak in tongues we have people that go to church to sit down and hear the Mysteries and they've turned these things into idols and if the church service isn't this way and if you don't do this and if you don't do that then you don't have what they have and they turn these things into an idol we can have church Traditions listen we do things differently in this church than other churches around the world and we do it by choice and by preference in some cases not because it's by the word of God there are things we do according to the word of God and those are absolute and we don't change them but there are ways that we operate in here as a church as a sovereign local body that others don't and guess what we can try and force people to bow down to that and it's just a church tradition it's just a preference it's not right it's not wrong it's just the way that we do it and yet somebody can come into this church and we try and force them into a certain way because that's the way everyone else does it but if the word doesn't say it's supposed to be that way then we aren't supposed to be doing that we're creating a religious Idol out of the Traditions that we've had all of our lives but he says regardless of where we are regardless of who we are we are filthy and we're Idol worshippers we've got something we bow down to every single day and we're dirty compared to a holy God doesn't matter if we're raised in a in a Christian Home doesn't matter if we're raised out in the world on the streets in the filthiest of homes by a scriptural standard we're all Filthy compared to a holy God Amen so you can't come to God thinking you don't need to be changed Jesus would talk about this Parable in Luke 18 of the of the Publican and the Pharisee and he said he spake this Parable sorry he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and they despised others self-righteousness despises others that's what we'll see he says two men went up into the temple to pray one a Pharisee a priest a man that was dedicated to not so much a priest didn't have to be a priest to be a Pharisee I don't think but they were taught a certain way and the other was a Publican and the Pharisees stood and prayed thus unto himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are can you imagine extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican brother Mark I'm not going to but he's pointing to somebody in the church have you you ever say God I am so thankful I'm not like brother John in a certain certain way sister still has she giggled but Church don't we do it we look at a family we look at a person and we say boy aren't we just so glad we're not like them we might say it up here we might never say it here come on let's be honest okay maybe we'll do some preaching this morning thank God thank God I'm not like him I'm not like her self-righteous religion I fast twice a week twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess he's well taught he's smug and he's convinced of his own righteousness the symptoms of a person like this of a self-righteous P person is they talk about themselves a lot in a glowing way and they talk about other people in a dismissive way let's check up let's check up this morning but the Publican standing AAR off see he wouldn't even come and approach but he stood a far off it says and he says he would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smed himself upon his breast saying God been merciful to me a sinner he's repentant he's acknowledging his natural condition and he has no thought of worthiness Jesus says I tell you this man the Publican that said I am God be merciful to me a sinner this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other why because one Justified himself the other asked God to do it he says for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted repentance is a key element of receiving the Holy Spirit we said before and we've preached this before that repentance is the Zeal of the leodan age in in Revelation 3 Jesus said as many as I love I rebuke and chasen repent be zealous therefore and repent so we can't start in a position of I am awesome I am great I am acceptable I am Holy I am good we have to come in saying I am a sinner even if we're better than most people we're still just the best of the worst we're still Sinners we're still filthy in God's eyes compared to his Holiness and his righteousness we are filthy amen that's a hard thing to preach these days because people are sitting here saying I am who I am I am who God made me don't we hear that I God made me like this how can he judge me no God didn't make you like that sin made you like that sin has dropped us from our image in the from the image of God and it's made us now in the image of man it made us in the image of a fallen Adam and so we are not in the image of God yes God is the source of our life and we live and Breathe by his grace and mercy but we are not the way he intended our original condition and nature is not one of godliness nor is it from God it is satanic it is in sin it is infilled so it's broken Humanity that needs to be changed and that's what God's trying to do that's what it's going to take that working of Ezekiel 36 so we have to recognize our original condition and that's the hardest thing in a religious World The World Isn't So religious these days but in some places it is and the hardest thing is to get a religious person to recognize their condition but he can continues in Ezekiel 36 he says now after I've cleaned you up he says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh now this is one of the trickiest elements of the new birth of receiving the Holy Spirit and it's a lot of it's where a lot of people get hung up because God says I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit in other words God says I'm going to change your life and when he does that because it's such a drastic change people think because I'm changed I've received the Holy Spirit but what's the change he takes away the Stony heart he takes that rebellious heart he takes away that stubborn heart that heart that can't receive correction that heart that can't receive love he takes that away and he gives us he says a heart of Flesh now a heart of Flesh if you think about flesh you think about your body and so you can squeeze flesh it's not this is hard it's resistant it's stiff necked it's stubborn but a heart of Flesh you can squeeze amen it can respond to God it can be changed by God it can move with the spirit of God it can allow the word to have an effect he would write in Jeremiah he says but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people so this changing of our heart and the spirit is what allows us to receive the word of God in its fullness that's a work of the holy spirit it's what allows us to receive it to respond to it to accept it and to obey it amen it's what cleans up our lives what takes away those worldly desires and it puts a Godly desire inside of our hearts now listen to this quote he says now the Bible said that he would give us a new heart and he would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people and Full Gospel people have been deceived in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit he says that wasn't his Spirit that's your spirit then I will put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I'll put my spirit in you he says and many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the Holy Spirit and you're trusting upon emotions and signs and things he says when your life doesn't match up to that he says now that's just a little raw but remember it's the truth he's saying you've got a change of heart you've got a change of attitude your spirit's changed but your life hasn't changed to line up with the word yet he's not saying they're wrong he's just saying you haven't finished the process amen he says many people that new spirit God has to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit why cuz what we have is the spirit in the nature of our mom and our dad and our grandpa and our Grandpa Grandma and Grandpa we have it in our DNA we have something that we've received from our family some of us have pretty good attitudes naturally but that's still not good enough we all of us need these things he says God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit Well some people are so mean they can't even get along with themselves let alone with God if he come in that's right he says they're so doubtful and up and down God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with his Spirit when it comes he says amen I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself and then he puts his holy spirit in there to dwell with you and abide with you notice he doesn't dechristianize these people we can't take away from what people have amen if they're at a place of repentance we say praise the Lord because that's the working of the holy spirit amen this is a process and it may take some time if they're at a place where their lives cleaned up and there's a change of heart and attitude we say praise the Lord because that's a working of the holy spirit amen but that won't get you into heaven that's not eternal life the holy spirit is eternal life so don't stop don't rest because you've received a life-changing experience go until you've received eternal life itself because eternal life is not accepting just accepting the work at Calvary for what Christ did there in in that he shed his blood and paid your sins that's not it the full work of Calvary was to put his life inside of you and so many people are preaching today that you receive you you you say I'm a sinner I accept what Christ did at Calvary now you're saved no the Salvation is what it's in receiving eternal life you've got to go all the way you've got to take the full work of redemption forgiveness is not the full work of redemption it's the starting point of redemption amen a new new heart and a new spirit isn't Redemption but it's on the path of redemption but it takes the body change to have our full Redemption and you got to have the Holy Spirit to Quicken that body to give you a body change so the the fullness of redemption is the receiving of the holy spirit in a way that's going to change your body and so that we can be caught up with him amen so we see that the the and we'll get into this probably in the next service that receiving the Holy Spirit can be something that you hear the word and it comes in a moment it can be a process of days it can be a process of weeks it could be a process of years and you could be truly on the path to eternal life you're a child of God but that Holy Spirit may not come at the beginning it may come a ways down your life it took me six months to receive the Holy Spirit after I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ some people receive it immediately some people receive it before some people receive it after we'll see as we go through scripture amen the timeline is not what's set in stone what's set in stone is the results the effect of the holy spirit in your life is the same for every single person amen but like I said we're facing the challenge of a religious people especially in North America and so we come to God and we try and fit him into our lives and we try and blend him into our programs and our way of doing things and that's never been the way that God works God always requires a total separation amen where we can't invite God into our program we have to leave ours and go to his that's what he said to Abraham he says leave your Kindred leave your land leave everything behind and come to me and that's been the same way it is through every time in history amen listen who's being redeemed us or God the redeemed are the ones that have to move the Redeemer stays where he is if God has to change to suit us then he's the one that's being redeemed he's the one that's being changed but the scripture says I am the Lord I change not so he can't be changing to suit us rather we have to be changed back into our original condition in what we were in the word in Christ Before Time Ever began amen so we can't invite God into our decisions and into our way of living and into our plans and that we have to lay those things down and take Christ and then once he's there then he makes our decisions he makes our plans he sets our life in order and we follow him rather than try and blend him into what we've already decided amen he's looking for surrender not not cooperation not we put in a bit and he puts in a bit right it's all or it's none that that's the only way God's going to work he's got to have total control and he will have total control scripture or he says now the Bible said here a new heart will I give you he says I like it always God speaking of something new that he's going to do that doesn't mean he'll just patch up that old condition but a new heart will I give you and I'll take away the Stony heart which you have and a new spirit will I give you Jesus Jesus taught the same thing in Luke when he said you can't put new wine into Old bottles he says wine has a life in it and wine new wine especially it's fermenting yet and it might spread out a little and if it goes to pushing in the old bottle the old dry Hive will burst and fly open see in those days they put wine into animal skin bottles and Jesus said you can't put new wine in Old bottles because why that old bottle has already been stretched and it's dry out it doesn't have any flexibility anymore and you fill it with new wine that new wine is fermenting so it's expanding inside there and what'll it do it'll bust the bottle open so he says if it goes to pushing in the old bottle the old dry Hive will burst and fly open and then the hide is ruined and also the bottle is ruined and the wine is spilled he says now that's about the picture we have before us today you can't come to an old formal bunch of intellectuals and with your ideas and try and adopt God's program into your intellectual program it just won't work that old dry cwh high will blow up because it just can't take it what's the problem today we've got Christians that have created Christians that have created their own Christian programs and they've left the word behind because it's not socially acceptable it doesn't fill the seats of the church it doesn't draw in big crowds and they've set their own way of worship and then what do they do is they invite God in and God can't come in because the way that they worship ship is contradictory to the word of God and so what is left if you aren't worshiping God then you're worshiping somebody else and the only thing that's left is Satan if God's not there listen today real Christianity is heresy to nominal Christianity see in the old days Paul said the way that I worship is the way that's called heresy because the way he worshiped was contrary to what the Jews believed now Christianity is come full circle to what where Paul believed is now heresy again they've fallen so far from the original word that it's called heresy again and so that's what they call us they call us Heretics they call us Cults they call us uh you know uh Fanatics because why we don't believe what the mainstream believes in critical areas and what are they doing they're worshiping doctrines they're worshiping Creeds they're worshiping a way of worship they're worshiping a way of preaching they're worshiping a way of service has to go rather than worshiping under the true word of God we've got to come out of all of it lay it down lay our opinion or preferences down lay it down and come to Christ I've said it before when I got saved listen I was raised in this message taught very well but between brother Mark and Sunday school brother Gerald over the pulpit I was raised listening to the word of God I understood it intellectually but when I got the Holy Spirit my application of the word changed drastically for starters I had a lot more grace I had a lot more grace why because I needed Grace I needed Grace because when I looked in the mirror of the word I saw my shortcomings and guess what it didn't matter how good or bad brother Bob was then cuz now he's working on me I needed that Grace and I continue to need that Grace and the thing is when God's busy working on me I don't have too much time to worry about how bad somebody else is and so what does it do yes I understood intellectually many of the doctrines but the application of the word change because now it's focused on me rather than focused on everybody else amen that's my testimony so it changed life is a part of the process of the new birth of receiving the Holy Spirit but it's not the end I thank God for every professing Christian that's had a changed life but that may not be the end depending where they at a life changed is not eternal life it's just a part of coming to eternal life Jesus spoke of the foolish virgins you realize in the Book of Matthew and you realize that a a virgin is a woman that has been Untouched by a man she's never been uh in any way soiled if you want to put it that way she is completely pure there's nothing that's been touched about her and if you look at those those those virgins there was five wise and there was five foolish so the foolish virgins they lived a clean life they had a Sanctified life they had the right Doctrine they went perhaps to the right Church they were dedicated to God they were sincere in every way on the outward expression and appearance the wise virgins and the foolish virgins looked exactly the same the foolish virgins dressed the right way they talked the right way they acted the right way everything about them was the same as the wise virgins what was the only difference one had the oil of the Holy Spirit the other one didn't but every in every other way they were exactly the same you can have a changed life and not have the Holy Spirit is what I'm getting at amen Judas had a changed life for quite some time but he didn't receive the Holy Spirit Paul worked with a bunch of ministers that had changed lives and then they walked away why they didn't have the Holy Spirit a changed life is not the only proof that we have amen what is it that they turn down Christ The Living Word that he comes in and he'll change us and he'll take away everything and he'll bring us subject to his word he continues now in Ezekiel 36 he says yes I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit he says and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall take my keep my judgments and do them we'll get into the evidence of the holy spirit in a future service but briefly I'll say this if you have the Holy Spirit you'll receive and obey the word of God as it comes to you that's what he says here you'll walk in my statutes you'll live according to my word amen and it won't be by legalism it won't be by discipline it'll be by a desire in your heart it'll be something inside of you that wants to do it you'll want to do what the word word says I'm not saying this flesh doesn't fight this flesh hates the word of God absolutely it hates the word of God why because it's uncomfortable it causes separation it causes us to give up things this flesh wants so I'm not saying there's not a battle there don't take the battle to think that you don't have the Holy Spirit but what's winning that'll tell you if you've got the Holy Spirit or not but look he says I'll give you a new spirit then I'll put my spirit in you what's the difference between a new spirit and his Spirit Well a new spirit is new and his spirit is unchanging it's always been there amen one is from God the other one is God anden one is a work of the Holy Spirit the other one is the Holy Spirit what we're talking about is an effect versus the person that's really what we're talking about that new spirit has its ups and downs it's in and outs it's not a perfect spirit it's a spirit that's meant to get along with God but it is not God it's just from him amen it's still subject to conditions and circumstances and events of life amen but the holy spirit is unmoving unchangeable all powerful it stands alone it stands sure it's a sure foundation so our new spirit is still variable the Holy Spirit doesn't change brother R puts it this way he says if you won't accept righteousness then unrighteousness will take over if you won't receive Christ the world will take you you can't go out that door the same person you were coming in here you can't be the Holy Spirit brooding wooing calling oh if you'll come I'll take away that Stony heart if you'll come I'll place a new spirit in you and if you'll come I'll come into this new spirit he says then when the Devil comes back what does he find he finds his old tinan alley that's what our life was before it's an alley between two buildings dirty Dark full of junk people throwing their stuff in he says God sent his big bulldozer down and cut all the thing to pieces and bulldozed it and scraped it all off and a Hallelujah Avenue is built there it isn't the same place there's a big modern home built there the Holy Spirit has brooded big beautiful flowers of Salvation standing up he says you don't have to try to impersonate anything it's a new heart it's a new dwelling place it's a new spirit everything is new he says how can the devil walk back there and expect the old card table and cigars and the old fussy fighting stewing and everything else you had in you he's saying it's a complete change of your life he says when he walks back he finds God took his bulldozer and run the whole thing out and turned the whole ground upside down made a big Terrace and put a beautiful home and moved in himself he says hallelujah the Holy Spirit turns over the old tinan alley and dumps you upside down sweeps the devil's stuff out there and creates a new heart and a new life he says not only that I love this but he moves in to see that everything goes all right he says glory to God remember what uh the scriptures say it says that a man a spirit leaves him and it goes out of a person's life and what do they do he says they clean up the house and they put everything in order but when that Spirit comes back finding nothing in the house he comes back with seven others worse than himself and the the final condition of that person is worse than when they started because it does you no good to clean up your life if you don't put a strong man in the house and that's what the holy spirit is that's what he's saying God moves into that cleaned up life see God does the work cuz he can't live in a filthy vessel so he cleans up the life he cleans up your attitude he cleans up your spirit he takes away those desires he cleans up the habits but then he has to come in to secure the house to seal your soul to the day of your Redemption and he comes in to make sure that nothing else comes back and gets on you cuz once he's in the house the soul is sealed and Satan can't ever get in that Soul oh he can press into your mind he can press into this body by way of sickness and stresses and fears but he cannot get into the soul because that is where God is living amen we've talked about the brooding of the Holy Spirit the last couple of services and how that purpose of the Holy Spirit was to bring out those seeds and produce and sustain the life that was in them but watch how Jesus sets things up after his resurrection he's in a glorified body and he comes to the disciples the doors are all locked to the room they're in and he appears in the middle of them he's in his glorified body now and he and he points to the Future and it says then Jesus said to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost this is a very strange event because Jesus says receive ye the Holy Ghost and did they receive the Holy Ghost right then no if we have to be so careful how we interpret events because you have Jesus Christ there in a glorified body breathing on them and saying receive the Holy Spirit and what happens absolutely nothing why because he's speaking prophetically he's not speaking for the moment because every single one of them went up on the day of Pentecost and they did receive the Holy Ghost so what he said came to pass but it didn't come to pass when he spoke it but he was pointing to the Future to the time and to the season amen and I'm saying that because I preach the same message here today and I will continue to preach it I preach that you are the Spotless sinless bride of Christ and you are and yet we still make mistakes what because our sinlessness is not in this flesh but it's in Christ but there's a day where we will be transformed completely to full sinless Perfection amen I preach what that we are a resurrected people we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ that's a spiritual place for now but it's an eternal place after this resurrection and Rapture is over but nonetheless you are there you're there but we only see the effects of that rather than the full reality of it right now we're moving into it and we're experiencing it but we don't have it yet we're on the road but we're not to our destination we could say so we can't get ahead of ourselves we believe the word we accept it by faith but God has to make it happen in our lives before we can say I've got it amen he's got to actually do the work by faith we can say it's ours but it takes God to say here it is in his time and in his season we're looking for the time where we can say this is it we've got it that's what we're looking for with the word so we have to be so careful how we interpret events and experiences amen a fanatic would have said right there I've received the Holy Ghost because Jesus breathed on me and said receive ye the Holy Ghost but that's not how it works amen we've got to take the full word of God if Jesus had given them the Holy Spirit then then they would have done the works that they did on the day of Pentecost right then and there but they knew nothing had changed but a fanatic would say well it's changed because he said it You' got to take the full word you got to take everything he said about that we're not trying to push down someone's Faith but we're trying to say make sure you compare to the whole word of God not just this one experience you have see brother B would say he says we we judge things by our experiences rather than by the word we've got to make our experiences subject to the word of God because that's the only way that we'll interpret them properly but we see now that Jesus goes and he ascends to heaven and now after he ascends they're in the season of receiving the Holy Spirit Spirit that's the time it's the season it's it's when he said it was going to happen and before he went away he said these words and he says behold I send the promise of my father upon you but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be ued with power from on high and he led them out as far as Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass when he blessed them he parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God Amen I want you to catch because we're in a season Church they're in the season of the promise of receiving the spirit they're in the days they're in the months or the week that's leading up to receiving it they know it Jesus has said it he's confirmed it he's breathed on them they are the people of the promise of Ezekiel 36 of Joel 2:28 and they're just buzzing about it there's a Revival sweeping through their midst and what do they do they go into the temple and they're worshiping and praising and they don't even have the promise yet but because they've received a revelation that the promise is for them what are they doing they're acting as if they've got it it's not wrong to act as if you've got it because when the word of God comes and it's personally revealed to you you can say I'm going to get it that scripture tells me we don't have to wait to receive it to thank God for it we don't have to wait for our healing to thank God for his healing promise we don't have to thank wait to thank God for his provision before he gives us a provision when he gives us his word and we receive it in a heart of faith we can come to church and we can have a Hallelujah service even if we haven't received it why cuz we're in the season of receiving the promise he's made it personal to you he's made it personal to me so our praise doesn't have to start after the victory after after the overcoming after the provision after the healing it can start as soon as we realize it's for me I'm a part of the promise I'm a part of the word and the reality is coming and I'm going to give him a praise of it this morning that's how our attitude ought to be church then we move jump we jump forward to Acts chapter 2 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place scripture there says fully come there's a first fruits Feast right after the Passover and that's the day that Christ rose from the dead the F the the the the day of the first fruits the original first fruit it's the first of the first and so Christ was raised from the dead by the spirit of God on that day of the first fruits what was he he was the first of many Brethren he was the first of many he was telling us that there's more coming like this so the day of Pentecost is the fullness of the Harvest the day of Pentecost is when the rest of the plants are in the condition that the first plant was they've come to where it was amen it's the Harvest celebration the day is the day of Pentecost is when the Harvest matches the first fruit amen so notice now it says they're all with one Accord in one place that word that phrase one Accord means they're all in unity they're all there for the same reason what's the reason start a church start a movement make a name for yourself no they're there to receive the promise of the word that's the only reason they're there they've been waiting for 10 days amen their promise of the word was his life in them the holy spirit inside of them not just on them not just around them but the personal presence of God in their lives that's why we come to church we either come to receive him or we come because we've received him that's the only reason to be be in church and what happens as we come into church is because we've received the word then the word continues to come and we continue to receive we continue to be cleaned encouraged corrected strengthened whatever we have need of that's what brings us into church is because we've received it or we're trying to receive it that's the purpose amen so they're not just there but the scripture says not just for the same purpose but they're in the same place they're gathered in one place now we stream our services because there are people that don't have churches to go to genuinely don't almost impossible for them to do it because of finances age whatever that might be but I want to say this this morning streaming is not the same as being in church and there are those that are streaming this morning that could be in church scripture doesn't say they were gathered online they were gathered in one place together and there is no comparison between being in a service here versus a service online it is completely different so I will say this to those that are listening if you can get to a church go to a church that's the scriptural requirement for a Believer is to be a part of a local body amen it's just no comparison verse two says so they're in one Accord they're in one place they're there for the same purpose they're all pulling on the word of God for the same thing says and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting now notice the wind was not them receiving the Holy Spirit the wind was the effect of the Holy SP Spirit coming into the building the noise is not life the moving of the spirit is not life it's just what proof that he's there potentially amen they're not the same don't confuse the noise with the person the noise is in effect but the person is life itself it says and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like of as fire and it sat upon the entire congregation it's not the way it says it it says it sat upon each of them it's an individual Affair it's an individual experience you do not get into heaven by Church affiliation you don't get there it's a personal experience amen it's an individual event every person got their own portion it says and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so they finally received this great promise of Ezekiel 36 of Joel 2:28 and what do they do with it what do they do with this great promise they do what we all ought to do they go tell other people about it if you got something like the Holy Spirit you'll let people know there's something out there for them amen they have the reality of the Gospel that they've never had they've had signs and wonders they've had Miracles healings raising from the dead walking on water storms spoken out of existence but they have a greater reality now by the Holy Spirit than they ever had with all of those experiences why they have passed from Death unto life they've received eternal life now Peter goes down and he starts to stand up and speak and you'll notice one thing when everyone has the holy spirit it's in order not everyone tries to stand up and speak not everyone wants to be the the spokesman for the for the new movement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ one stands up and he starts to preach and what does he do he takes them back to the word of God that's what the holy spirit will do it'll take you back to the word of God and he shows them where they're at at what they're seeing and he shows how it's the experience that the word of God promised them the holy spirit always confirms the word amen what's Peter saying this is it he said what you've read about for hundreds and hundreds of years this is it that's what the message always is this is it that's what happens amen it points us to the time we're in it points us to the season we're in and then it gives us the opportunity to accept it or reject it that's what the holy spirit's always trying to do trying to get the people to where God is at in his Plan of Redemption and then the invitation made be a part of it come join accept it and be a part of it amen and he he starts to go and he he said he shows them all the events that have happened in the last three and a half years and in particular the last few months and he tells them what they did to Jesus and he tells them who Jesus is and he tells them what they did and he tells him now but it didn't stop him he's risen from the dead he's Lord in Christ and he tells him there's a purpose to all of it and then he gives the opportunity and he lays it right in their lap he says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God ha made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do so under the inspired preaching of the word of God by the Holy Spirit their consciences are bothered you you know what preachers are trying to do today keep from pricking the people's consciences why cuz people with their consciences bothered don't want to come back to church but these people do when these people when their consciences were pricked when they're they started to bother them they recognize their condition they recognize their failure that they don't say I don't want to hear anymore they say how do I change it how do I fix this condition that I'm in how do I get back into the the the good Graces of God Amen the holy spirit in their life working in their midst drew them to a place of change it did not condemn them amen we're not here to drive people away this morning Book of Revelation says the spirit and the bride say come it's always an invitation we're not here to put people out if people want to go out let them go out themselves we're here to say come in come in get a little closer I preached on uh on that woman at the well you know it amazes me and it goes to show the predestination of God because Jesus goes through her life and he says you're bound in sin because you can't stay in a marriage you're divorced and remarried and now you're living common law and then he says oh by the way you don't even know how to worship God that would drive most people right out of the church doors you don't know where you're at you don't know what you're doing but what did he say he said there's a solution and I've got it he said cuz when he comes he's to come in spirit and in truth and that'll fix every problem you've got in your life sister and that's when she Drew in she Drew in because she recognized her condition but she saw no condemnation but she saw an invitation for her life to be changed that he wasn't putting her down because she was a Samaritan a mixed breed a mixed blood a mixed religion a fallen life a fallen woman but she heard mercy and Grace coming through that man as it discerned her life that's what Drew her in amen we don't have to worry if we're wrong church we have to worry if we won't accept the correction of being wrong when the word comes our way that's when we ought to say hey this is me that's me doesn't matter if you're a pastor to the janitor we ought to be able to say I'll take the correction when it comes and they ask that simple question what shall we do how do we fix this how do we make it right how do we get back in the good graces of God they know they've crucified the Messiah the scripture says these were devout Jews sincere Believers committed to the word of God and then they realize they broken everything that he told them and they say what do we do what does p what does Peter tell them join the church pay your ties dress right no that's putting the cart before the horse he says get a life-changing experience what you have hasn't worked you you need a different life you need a different religion you need a different thing you need to accept the changer rather than trying to be the change yourself that's the greatest struggle I find in young people is they're trying to change themselves for God rather than letting God do the work you can't do it you can't do it you've got to surrender and say I can't do it I need a lifechanging presence in my own life amen what does Peter say then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost first thing he says repent first work of the Holy Spirit repentance that means it's not my work and it's not your work that word repent means a changing of the mind that leads to a changing of a lifestyle see you have to realize up here that what you're doing is wrong that the way you think the way you act the way you respond the lifestyle you live whatever it might be it's wrong so you can't repent of something unless you come to a new revelation that what you do is wrong so he's got to change the mind and that will come down and that'll convict your heart amen and only the Holy Spirit can change your mind otherwise man will move it here and man will move it there and one will convince you in and want to convince you out and it's just the whims of men moving in our lives but he changes our mind and there's a new heart and a new spirit that comes with that amen but after we're we repent we must be saved right that's that's what the world teaches if you repent and he forgives you of your sins then you're saved right that's not what Peter said Peter says repent and and what be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ wait a second that's not what Jesus told them to do Peter's not repeating word for word what Jesus said did he World teaches this and it's in the scriptures so we have to preach it he says go then and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the the Holy Spirit I recognized something yesterday in studying that I have never recognized before and I guarantee you if I told you to quote this scripture every single one of us would quote it wrong we would say baptizing them in the name he doesn't say in the name did you notice in the denominations when they do it they don't say into the name they say baptizing in the name that is not what the scripture says has anybody else ever noticed this I have never noticed it cuz it's always been quoted to me in in the name of the father Son and the Holy Spirit that is not what Jesus said he says baptizing them into the name that completely changes it completely changes it amen that word into means indicating a direction or change of position towards something and if you go to the New Testament Paul uses that same word to describe the real baptism he says for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body in Christ one body in Christ and everyone sorry whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one so it's not the same as the word in that Peter uses in Acts 238 where he says baptized in the name of Jesus Christ into and in are not the same word here not even close not even close because that word in the name of Jesus Christ in means upon the basis of or by and through so he says you're baptized through Christ it's in the name or on the basis of the work of Calvary that's how we're baptized but that is not being baptized into the name that's baptizing in the name two very different things watch what Paul says now he says in Romans 12:5 he says so we be many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another now this word in means a finished work this is at the end of it all you're in Christ amen first we were going into but now he says we're in how by the the Holy Spirit not by water baptism by the baptism of the holy spirit so we're in one body of whom Christ the word so we're not looking for water baptism we're looking for Holy Ghost baptism that's the baptism that's going to make the change water baptism is just the outward sign outward work outward sign of an inward work water baptism does not change you it represents it's symbolic of a change that's supposed to have happened where you have died out to sin and you've risen a new creation or new creature in Christ baptism doesn't change you amen it's a symbol that we've died out to self listen to what John said was Jesus came before he came up to the River Jordan he says I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire scripture says our God is a consumer in God so John says I'm not saying he's not going to baptize you with water but the water is not what makes the difference it's the fire of the Holy Spirit that's going to make the difference and isn't that exactly what we saw on the day of Pentecost we saw him come down and baptize them with the Holy Ghost and Fire the Holy Ghost falling down tongues of fire and it changed the lives of 120 people in an instant so when Jesus said baptizing them into the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost what was he saying he was saying get them into the body of Christ get them into Holy Ghost baptism not just into water baptism get them into the new birth John the Baptist baptized people with water did it change them no Jesus baptized all of his disciples including Judas was that the new birth no it was a part of the process but that was not the life-changing experience it was symbolic but the actual right of baptism the ritual of baptism is not a life-changing experience that's not what's going to make the difference it can hold you back but it's not what gives you New Life the scripture tells us how to be baptized so it matters how we're baptized amen but what matters most is are you baptized into the body of Christ because without that we're lost so if we take all those four scriptures we just read saying baptizing them into the name and then saying be baptized in the name and then being baptized into one body and then saying that one body is Christ if we put all of those together if you'll grant me a little bit of mathematical leverage this morning we can take if a is equal to B and B is equal to C then we can substitute a for C right right right Jonathan yes we can so we come up with a very simplified scripture where he says go then and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them into what is the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost Jesus Christ baptizing them into Jesus Christ how by receiving the Holy Spirit that's the baptism that he came with lots of baptisms before that but this is the only one that'll make the big difference he says you got to make disciples how do you make a disciple what what determines if we're a disciple or not we live by the word Jesus said he said if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed you got to live according to the word and we already read Ezekiel 36 that said the only only way you can live by the word is if you have the spirit of God in you that's the thing that'll make you watch in his stat walk in his statutes and judgments so it takes the spirit of God to live the word of God which is what makes you a disciple so you can't be a disciple unless you've got the holy spirit so what was Jesus saying he was saying get them into me get them into Christ The Living Word water baptism no matter how perfectly done will not make you live according to the word you need a new heart you need a new spirit to get along with God to change your desires and then you need the spirit of God to come in and make those things all live so when we look at acts 238 that is the Fulfillment of Matthew 28:19 because remember Jesus said to Peter he says I'm giving you the keys to the kingdom however you unlock it is how I'll unlock it and whatever you unlock on Earth I'll unlock in heaven and vice versa so Peter's words on the day of Pentecost acts 238 is the Fulfillment of Matthew 28:19 so that if we want to interpret Matthew 28:19 we just jump up to acts 238 and that is the way that Jesus intended it so if you're baptized in titles you're baptized wrong cuz G because Peter never baptized in the titles he baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you can't find a single place in scripture where anybody baptized in anything other in the name of Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus you can't find it that's the interpretation of the scripture is how they did it not by how we believe it by we I mean a denomination or something like that they interpret it but then you look at the interpretation by the apostles and it was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen it matters how we're baptized Paul goes to Ephesus or Corinth no he came to Ephesus it came to pass that when while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed the word had come to them and he says have you received the Holy Ghost yet and they said unto we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost they said what are you talking about we haven't heard nobody's preached to us about the Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized see this was the litness of how far they' gone with the word it says and they said un John's baptism so they have received the word they received the message of John they were in line to receive eternal life but the word had moved on from John's message they were sincere they were children children of God they were living according to the message they have received but they were yet in ignorance but God doesn't leave us in our ignorance he sends the messenger of the age directly to their door and says have you moved on in the word they say we don't even know about this thing called the Holy Ghost and so then Paul said John ver verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Jesus Christ so the world have been the word have been revealed further but they hadn't caught it they weren't around for it but now the Holy Spirit comes to them by way of Paul and he gets them back in the full light of the word and now what's the question will you accept it or will you not it's a very simple thing it says and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus brother V I remember you asking this question why do we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in the name of Jesus Christ because Peter said Jesus Christ and Paul said Lord Jesus you put it together you get Lord Jesus Christ he says ' and when Paul had laid hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied they get baptized the right way they've been baptized they followed the word as far as they knew how the word is further revealed to them it corrects their baptism as soon as they're baptized Paul lays hands on them and they get the Holy Ghost what was holding them back not sincerity not their life they just needed the word and as soon as the word came and showed them a further level a further stage than then they jump into it and all of a sudden they receive the promise and they receive eternal life right then see we've got to walk in the light of the word of God the message as we understood it in 1970 is not as we understand it in 2024 God is continuing to open up his word why because he's bringing us into resurrection and Rapture that's the season we're in and so he's continuing to unfold it and there are things that we beli back then that maybe we weren't quite right maybe we were flat out wrong or maybe we just didn't take it far enough and we've got to be able to Humble ourselves and say there's more there's more because I don't have it all there's more because I'm not out of here there's more because I don't have all the victory I need and so we're looking for the word of God to come to us and do that now notice this now as we start to close today we'll pick it up again on Wednesday to close it out Lord willing Peter says for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so is the holy spirit only for the apostles is it only for the people is it that were gathered that day is it only for the ministry Peter said it's for whosoever is called of God whosoever is called of God it's for the children of God they might not know they're a child of God but that's what the holy spirit's doing now is it's going out and it's brooding and it's wooing and it's calling them in amen it's not just for parents it's not just for people raised in a religious home it's for the children of God that the holy spirit is calling back to him amen it's not just for the days of the Apostles it's for every single age if they can hear what the spirit's saying they get the reward of the holy spirit amen now they had to T and wait for 10 days until God's timing on the day of Pentecost but since then it's always been God's time brother Braham says we don't have to T anymore you're sitting here this morning saying I need the Holy Ghost but I've got to wait you're wrong it's available this morning we don't have to wait it's available able to whosoever will this morning the kingdom the the door to the kingdom of heaven is wide open and it stayed wide open and it's open till God shuts it by way of a resurrection and Rapture amen I I shared a clip with uh some ministerial Brothers this week and as Pope Francis telling preachers within the Catholic church I assume that they were preaching upward too long upwards of 20 to 30 minutes he was admonishing them to preach short services and these are his exact words he says preachers must must preach an idea a feeling and a call to action Beyond 8 minutes the preaching starts to fade it is not understood I think he needs to talk to Peter because we would say Peter your message is given you've given the opportunity you've explained it all now it's in their laps they can take it or leave it Paul preached so long that uus fell out of the window asleep but what happened Paul went down and raised him from the dead and then he said get back up in that window and we're going to continue the service I'm not admonishing that we're going to preach long I'm at 67 minutes that's since I left my office we're doing okay this morning I'm on my last page but Peter didn't stop there it says and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this UNT generation I am talking to more and more people today in this world and they're saying what is wrong with the world I was talking to well I just put this way I was talking to somebody the other day and they said it's just all doom and gloom and it seems like we're going down down down he said to the point where you can't even look at the news anymore we've got an answer and it's the same answer that Peter had save yourselves from this untar generation get into Christ amen it says then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 Souls Church how do we add Souls not by baptism not by water baptism amen you add a soul to the body of Christ by the Holy Spirit by one spirit were baptized into the body 3,000 people received the Holy Spirit that day on the basis of Peter's testimony and exhortation under the anointing of the Holy Spirit they obeyed what he said they repented they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and their obedience and their actions were accepted by God and he confirmed it by giving them the Holy Spirit verse 42 says this and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers amen God bless you let's stand this morning how do you receive the Holy Spirit receive the word for your day I don't mean that to say pick and choose from the word by any means but take what God gives you and act on it and apply it and let it live through you remember what Jesus said to his disciples he says go and T Go wait till you get it and don't do anything until you get it that was the word for their day they had been baptized they had repented he says now you go and wait because I've got a time appointed he never told anyone else to do that the word for their day was go and wait until you get it and after that he never tells anyone else the word for their day was you got to go and wait until I come and give you the promise after that Peter says just do what we did and you'll get the same thing except the word except what he's telling you this morning repent be baptized the right way in the name of Jesus Christ and you'll get the holy spirit it's that simple it's that simple now some brothers May disagree with me but I'll say this I believe you can get the Holy Spirit just about anywhere if the word comes your way and you receive it you can get the Holy Spirit but it will lead you into all truth it will not leave you where you're at some people believe you can only get the Holy Ghost in this message no I believe that the Holy Ghost will lead you to this message amen but there are many sincere people out there that are children of God and they're coming this way what is it it's the Holy Spirit leading and guiding them but he's got to get a hold in their life first and so he takes them out of where they are and he brings them into truth amen that's the power we're looking for that's resurrection power that's Rapture power that's healing power that's saving power that's changing power that's overcoming power amen that's what we need not just Doctrine not just coming to church but we need the very life of Jesus Christ inside of us amen we'll cover this a little more on Wednesday Lord willing get into how do we get it Beyond this what does it look like what does the timeline look like and then we'll start to get into how do I even know I have the Holy Ghost scripture says make your calling and election sure in other words check up make sure that your life matches what the word says you ought to have if you're a Believer and that's really really how we're going to focus on this series for the next couple of services Lord willing amen let's just bow our heads if we would Lord God Lord I love the clarity of your word Lord I love the Simplicity of your word Lord where if we do what you say we get what you told us we get Lord and you told us that if we'd sincerely repent Lord we'd be baptized the right way Lord that you would give us the gift of the Holy Spirit not by our works not by our righteousness not by our goodness Lord but your the prophet reminded us that full obedience entitles us to the Token Lord I pray this morning if there's those that don't have your spirit in their life Lord they would recognize the Simplicity Lord that they would fully surrender their lives to you Lord that they would let the life-changing power of the Holy Spirit Come into them Lord not to work up not to pull something down lord but in simple Faith Just Surrender Lord and let your spirit have its way Lord I pray for our young people Lord I pray you give them overcoming power Lord that you would separate them out Lord that you would keep them clean and uncluttered from the things of this world Lord I pray for those that are out and about Lord that need to come back in Lord we pray that your spirit would just be wooing them that it would be brooding over them that they would neither have rest nor peace Lord until they can come back into your presence and be baptized into the body of Christ Lord I pray for those that have your spirit this morning Lord that they would be refilled Lord that they would be resaturated with your presence Heavenly Father Lord that where we're dry and worn out where we're weary Lord where we've lost the joy of our Salvation Lord that you could come back in Lord not our soul our soul is sealed Lord but you would pour yourself on our spirit and on our flesh Lord that you would give us a feeling of it not just Lord that sole portion Lord but let us enjoy your presence in our lives Heavenly Father Lord not just in church but when we walk out those doors Lord to know that you're with us you're in US you're working in our lives Lord that you're taking us to a certain end each one Lord we need healing Lord I need healing for my eye this morning Lord there's those that need healing in the Collins home this morning Lord sister Betty needs healing for her eyes Lord
