[57:35] in your Bibles to st. Matthew's Gospel
[57:37] chapter 13 st. Matthew chapter 13 the
[57:44] grace of God has been going to the word
[57:46] and endeavoring again to bring it to a
[57:48] conclusion regarding what we have
[57:50] started on hearing and seen the way that
[57:54] God wants us to hear and see and the
[57:57] right motives and the right objectives a
[57:59] man and everything comes down to hearing
[58:03] and seeing everything comes down to
[58:05] having the right motive and a right
[58:06] objective based on what we're hearing
[58:08] and seeing a man this is what God is
[58:11] looking at are we hearing it the way God
[58:13] wants us to hear it are we seeing it the
[58:15] way God wants us to see it and do we
[58:17] have the right motive and the right
[58:19] objective toward the revelation amen
[58:22] where are we really truly on green and
[58:25] thirsting to get out of here a man
[58:27] Mostar to cut up with the natural things
[58:30] of life that brother they don't really
[58:31] don't want to go yet but I tell you you
[58:34] gotta want to go when you want to go
[58:36] you'll go amen
[58:38] by the grace of God so god help us again
[58:40] to give us the right spirit the right
[58:42] attitude the right motive the right
[58:44] objective a man in what we believe and
[58:48] brother again let me say it again
[58:50] there's many that say they believe the
[58:52] word they believe the message but they
[58:54] don't have a right motive and a right
[58:55] objective I've seen that as I said for
[58:58] over 50 years and still seen it but it's
[59:00] getting worse
[59:01] amen so the grace of God be with us as
[59:04] we go to conclude hopefully that tonight
[59:07] or on Wednesday concerning these
[59:09] thoughts but in st. Matthew's Gospel
[59:11] chapter 13 and beginning to read at
[59:14] verse 13 therefore speak I to them in
[59:19] parables because they seeing see not
[59:24] than I've seen as God wants them to see
[59:27] it and it says earing they hear not and
[59:31] neither do they
[59:33] understand guy wants to us to see the
[59:37] way that he sees it the way that he
[59:39] hears it a man the way they wants us to
[59:42] see it an arat a man and if it's that
[59:45] way then we'll have the understanding
[59:47] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[59:51] Isaiah was saying by hearing ye shall
[59:54] hear and not shall not understand seeing
[59:57] ye shall see and shall not perceive
[1:00:00] they're not going to hear it or see it
[1:00:03] the way they should or they need to to
[1:00:05] give them the faith that they need for
[1:00:08] this people's heart is waxed gross and
[1:00:10] their ears are dull of airing and their
[1:00:14] eyes they have closed lest at any time
[1:00:17] they should see with their eyes and hear
[1:00:19] with their ears and should understand
[1:00:22] with their heart a man and should be
[1:00:27] converted and I should heal them a man
[1:00:30] to be healed spiritually to be healed in
[1:00:34] our souls a man going beyond the natural
[1:00:37] heating to the spiritual so again he
[1:00:40] said ear with their ears and should
[1:00:43] understand with their heart and should
[1:00:46] be converted and I should heal them and
[1:00:50] it says but blessed are your eyes for
[1:00:54] they see and your ears for they hear a
[1:00:59] man for verily I say unto you that many
[1:01:02] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:01:05] to see those things which ye see and
[1:01:09] have not seen them and to hear those
[1:01:13] things which he hear and have not heard
[1:01:16] them a man god bless his word you may be
[1:01:20] seated I pray the lord help me to stick
[1:01:29] to the notes or to stick to the quotes
[1:01:31] concerning what God has said through his
[1:01:34] servant the prophet and again
[1:01:36] understanding this that it wasn't
[1:01:37] William Branham it was God a man it was
[1:01:41] God doing what II by grace wanted to do
[1:01:45] for you and me
[1:01:47] in the hour that we are living brother
[1:01:49] is not that God wanted to come back with
[1:01:51] what Luther had in Wesleyan and the
[1:01:54] Pentecostals but no it is it is to bring
[1:01:56] it all to a conclusion and it is it is
[1:01:59] the cap it off it is to crown it and as
[1:02:01] he said in 1965 that he said my menace
[1:02:04] my message is the crowning he said of
[1:02:07] the Pentecostal message it is the
[1:02:09] crowning of what God did in the early
[1:02:12] days of the Pentecostal revival a man
[1:02:15] than it is for the calling out of the
[1:02:17] bride it is for the resurrection it is
[1:02:19] for the rapture it is for the change it
[1:02:21] is brother Ezra bring everything to a
[1:02:24] conclusion a man and is to take us from
[1:02:27] time to eternity
[1:02:29] a man now the brother according to
[1:02:33] history the Pentecostals the early
[1:02:35] Pentecostals of over a hundred years ago
[1:02:37] they really believe many of them back
[1:02:40] they and really believe that that the
[1:02:42] message that God had give them and what
[1:02:44] God was doing in them and what God was
[1:02:46] doing through them they believed that
[1:02:48] God was going to it was going to bring
[1:02:50] the resurrection and the rapture her
[1:02:52] brother the faith that God gave under
[1:02:54] the Pentecostal message was not
[1:02:56] resurrection and referring faint it was
[1:02:59] the faith of the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:01] Ghost and it was the faith of the gifts
[1:03:04] of the Spirit a man as weak as we
[1:03:07] clearly discern and see what God has
[1:03:09] done that the revelation of the faith
[1:03:11] that he gave them getting that he gave
[1:03:13] them back in the days of Luther
[1:03:16] it was the faith of the revelation of
[1:03:18] justification because that's what they
[1:03:21] needed they didn't need the faith that
[1:03:23] God is giving you and me a man
[1:03:28] concerning the resurrection rapture
[1:03:30] because it was in the hour for the
[1:03:32] resurrection it was in the hour for the
[1:03:34] rapture it was the hour for man to be
[1:03:37] justified because God said I will
[1:03:39] restore seeing the Lord and to restore
[1:03:42] he would have to begin with
[1:03:44] justification a man he would have to
[1:03:46] justify his seat he would have to
[1:03:49] justify the elect and the very elect of
[1:03:51] God and so he began at beginning with
[1:03:53] Martin Luther and he gave them the
[1:03:55] revelation of justification he given the
[1:03:58] revelation - Wesley of sanctification of
[1:04:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:04:05] gifts of the Spirit brother what power
[1:04:07] what anointing was on the earth and in
[1:04:09] the earth and it was on the saints of
[1:04:11] God and in the saints of God down
[1:04:14] through those ages and down through
[1:04:16] those years because I can I can look
[1:04:18] back and remember the moving of the
[1:04:21] Spirit of God I can look back and sense
[1:04:23] the anointing in the atmosphere a man
[1:04:25] morning noon and night the anointing was
[1:04:28] there morning noon and night
[1:04:29] not just in church it was out there a
[1:04:32] man no matter where you were you know
[1:04:34] you could have been at your job you
[1:04:36] could have been in school you could have
[1:04:37] been in your home the anointing was
[1:04:39] there a man but that anointing is now
[1:04:42] there like it used to be a man because
[1:04:45] moving away from the Pentecostal message
[1:04:47] and into the bride message we're getting
[1:04:49] Ida out of the loud of C&H and into the
[1:04:51] bride age so what is what it wasn't what
[1:04:54] God did in in the previous ages is one
[1:04:56] thing and what he's doing in this age is
[1:04:58] another and not only that but the number
[1:05:01] of believers said we're in existence man
[1:05:03] is one thing but the number of believers
[1:05:05] that are here now is another a man there
[1:05:08] were maybe thousands that during the
[1:05:10] Pentecostal revival but they're very
[1:05:12] very very few during in the right
[1:05:14] revival a man that it is getting less
[1:05:17] and less and less and less no doubt that
[1:05:20] we could we could identify maybe
[1:05:22] thousands in Luther's day thousands and
[1:05:24] thousands in Wesley's name and there
[1:05:26] were thousands that identified with the
[1:05:28] Pentecostal revival and the Pentecostal
[1:05:30] message a hundred years ago and maybe
[1:05:33] even back back to 50 or 60 years ago a
[1:05:36] man but then we came out of that the
[1:05:38] bride did and we came into the
[1:05:41] revelation of the mystery of God the
[1:05:43] finish of the mystery of God a man back
[1:05:47] him back in the in while for the
[1:05:49] believer it was in the end of in the 60s
[1:05:51] and maybe in the late 60s as we approach
[1:05:53] the seventies I believe there was
[1:05:56] anything any any area that is a or time
[1:06:00] that is important for us to behold and
[1:06:02] to see what God was doing and what God
[1:06:05] did it is in the late sixties and the
[1:06:07] seventies because again those that were
[1:06:10] in the Pentecost revival
[1:06:12] identify with the Pentecost revival and
[1:06:14] what God did and what God was doing that
[1:06:17] was coming to a conclusion after the
[1:06:19] going of the Prophet and we were seeing
[1:06:21] less and less of the Pentecostal revival
[1:06:24] we were experiencing less and less of
[1:06:27] the anointing of the Holy Ghost a man it
[1:06:30] just wasn't there like it used to be a
[1:06:33] man brother but in it wasn't on the
[1:06:36] number of people that he used to be on
[1:06:38] and there were thousands experiencing
[1:06:41] the power of God
[1:06:42] thousands experiencing the baptism of
[1:06:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:45] thousands were experiencing the gifts of
[1:06:47] the Holy Ghost but it began to begin to
[1:06:50] dwindle down because by Pentecost
[1:06:52] like all the rest they became a
[1:06:53] denomination amen
[1:06:56] they organized and in what God had done
[1:06:58] in the early nineteen hundreds to them
[1:07:01] he was just becoming a doctrine and it
[1:07:03] was becoming just theology or God did
[1:07:06] this and God did that a man it was all
[1:07:08] past tense a man anyway they were they
[1:07:11] were moving into that realm in a all of
[1:07:13] their lives a man that what God had done
[1:07:17] really they couldn't identify where God
[1:07:20] is doing because to them it was back
[1:07:23] then
[1:07:23] no no what he started back then he was
[1:07:26] continuing and the thing of it is to
[1:07:28] identify with it and become a part of it
[1:07:31] you have to walk in the spirit
[1:07:33] a man praise the Lord see Wesley he was
[1:07:37] walking in the spirit that started in
[1:07:39] the days of Luther a man because again
[1:07:42] as they've expressed it at ly I trust
[1:07:44] will understand it a man they Wesley
[1:07:47] came to the revelation of sanctification
[1:07:49] a man as Luther came to the revelation
[1:07:52] of justification well and where did
[1:07:56] Luther Wesley get his revelation it was
[1:07:59] in a cottage meeting a man where they
[1:08:01] were where they were praising God for
[1:08:03] what he did sue Martin Luther a van is
[1:08:07] now a wasn't John Wesley at the time but
[1:08:10] John Wesley was there a man because John
[1:08:13] Wesley was hungry and thirsty for
[1:08:15] sanctification amen and where
[1:08:18] though there were for justification God
[1:08:20] gave it to Luther and God was bringing
[1:08:22] Wesley into a position where he would
[1:08:24] receive the revelation that he needed a
[1:08:27] man for the generation that he was going
[1:08:30] to minister to and hear any and after he
[1:08:33] received it he would preach five times a
[1:08:35] day amen but not five times a day
[1:08:39] there's dude there's many today they
[1:08:41] would they don't even want to have five
[1:08:43] services a week they wouldn't want to
[1:08:45] get into the place where they won't even
[1:08:47] have a service a week a man is going to
[1:08:49] get to that place mother sister and as
[1:08:52] the part of God sent in you you you will
[1:08:53] go there and you'll go there looking for
[1:08:55] God a man to talk to the Lord
[1:08:58] oh yeah that's good good when it comes
[1:09:00] to worship and all these things are
[1:09:02] going to get less and less and less and
[1:09:04] as say many a believer is going to going
[1:09:06] to come under under a denominational
[1:09:08] spirit a man then I could be rejoicing
[1:09:12] in this rejoicing that because it's all
[1:09:14] going to be past tense and as well as
[1:09:17] Luther and his message was past tense
[1:09:19] and Wesley and his message with past
[1:09:21] tense the Pentecostals and their
[1:09:23] messages past tense amen certainly not
[1:09:26] what's going on today of the Pentecostal
[1:09:28] church it's not what's going on today in
[1:09:30] the Methodist or the Lutheran Church hey
[1:09:32] man and brother what God did in bringing
[1:09:34] out bringing out the message believers
[1:09:36] in this our brother what God was doing
[1:09:38] 50 years ago or 40 years ago or 30 years
[1:09:41] ago that's not going on in messy
[1:09:43] churches today because as all the others
[1:09:46] organized fall and what God did just
[1:09:49] became this became past tense nothing
[1:09:52] was in the present tense so it's the
[1:09:53] same now regardless whether be on our
[1:09:56] guard a man as brothers and sisters of
[1:10:00] like precious faith be on our guard
[1:10:02] concerning what we believe because only
[1:10:04] what God has done and because only what
[1:10:06] God is doing in us with us through us
[1:10:08] amen brother beyond regardless
[1:10:11] ruthlessly become a past tense amen and
[1:10:14] then again to many it is past tense God
[1:10:17] did to this God did do that oh yeah
[1:10:20] willing ran away morning 1909 a man who
[1:10:23] anyway when he was this age you know the
[1:10:26] here's the pillar fire and the voice of
[1:10:28] God in in a tree and then as he got to
[1:10:30] get up to an older age in 1933 the oh
[1:10:34] yeah the the pillar of fire came down
[1:10:36] pitched and and they did this they did
[1:10:39] this they did that it's all past tense
[1:10:41] the first pull the second pull past
[1:10:44] tense amen
[1:10:45] but brother the third pole is to be
[1:10:48] prison tense amen it is not to become a
[1:10:52] past tense the third pole is to be the
[1:10:56] present tense
[1:10:56] amen brother the popular continuity and
[1:11:00] he that God is going to do this god is
[1:11:01] doing this God is doing that and he knew
[1:11:04] he said he wanted to be in the
[1:11:05] resurrection he wanted to be in the
[1:11:06] rapture and he said if God wanted him to
[1:11:08] go before it struck and he said I'll go
[1:11:11] he said I'll be satisfied ain't man and
[1:11:14] he knew that I was coming when God was
[1:11:16] going to take him off the scene because
[1:11:18] as he said to leave ale and he said even
[1:11:21] the older generation in William
[1:11:23] branham's day he said they're going to
[1:11:25] be taken off the scene because they they
[1:11:27] will not believe that that faith of the
[1:11:30] Resurrection they will be able to have
[1:11:32] that faith of the rapture and so on no
[1:11:34] no so he said that's what God is going
[1:11:36] to take them off the scene and God is
[1:11:38] going to raise up another generation
[1:11:40] that will believe the third pole another
[1:11:43] generation that will believe the
[1:11:45] revelation of the resurrection the
[1:11:47] revelation of the rapture another it
[1:11:48] will not be a past tense thing will be a
[1:11:50] present tense
[1:11:51] amen but yet so many believers are past
[1:11:54] since God did this God did this God did
[1:11:57] that and brother the fact that they're
[1:11:58] that many believers just feel the all
[1:12:01] they got to do is read a book or all
[1:12:03] they got to do is or listen to a tape a
[1:12:05] man yes past tense let's get into what
[1:12:08] God's doing let us let us get under the
[1:12:10] ministry they did that's done as
[1:12:12] ministry on what God is doing
[1:12:14] amen and again in the seals or they say
[1:12:17] it's the seals this this is this and so
[1:12:19] we all I've got to do is listen to the
[1:12:21] tapes
[1:12:21] no no they be listening to the tapes
[1:12:23] rather when the bride is gone that's
[1:12:25] exactly the truth I said and I said this
[1:12:28] here bad back in 1985 in brother of the
[1:12:31] fortress Church a man I said listen I
[1:12:34] say when I said when the bride is gone
[1:12:36] they were still here i sir preaching
[1:12:38] Malachi 4
[1:12:39] the bride is gone to be silly or
[1:12:41] preaching the goddess and a prophet when
[1:12:43] the bride is gone to be still here
[1:12:45] approaching oh the said the mystery of
[1:12:47] God is shreddies the mystery of God is
[1:12:49] revealed hey yeah I said whether
[1:12:51] brighter be gone because she entered and
[1:12:53] became one with the mystery of God one
[1:12:56] with the revelation of the mystery of
[1:12:57] God she identified with it not now and
[1:13:00] not just William Branham but she
[1:13:02] identified with Christ a man praise the
[1:13:05] name of the Lord for the Lord himself
[1:13:07] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:13:08] amen now William Branham it was the Lord
[1:13:11] and again it was the ace of the man
[1:13:14] revealing these from a man and he said
[1:13:15] gets your problem he said I am NOT the
[1:13:19] son of man he said I am a son a man
[1:13:22] revealing this on a man and he said you
[1:13:24] know your problem he said he said you

[1:29:11] reasoning oh yeah cast down those things
[1:29:15] to believe the will of God again O Lord
[1:29:20] as he got himself showed it God Himself
[1:29:24] reveal it when he when he was in
[1:29:26] Gethsemane oh he pray
[1:29:29] knowing what was going to happen no he
[1:29:30] was gonna he prayed I prayed and prayed
[1:29:32] that maybe maybe even God would think of
[1:29:35] another way maybe even God would do it
[1:29:38] another way but no as he prayed and
[1:29:42] prayed and prayed no doubt he was the
[1:29:44] word so they knew the word so he had to
[1:29:46] stay with the word unto finally he cried
[1:29:49] and he sweat as a great word great drops
[1:29:52] of blood just to this believers today
[1:29:54] don't sweat water little own blood
[1:29:57] oh yeah not what comes to the burden of
[1:30:00] the word not when it comes to the burden
[1:30:02] of bearing a witness of the truth I'm
[1:30:05] not gonna sweat like Jesus did god help
[1:30:10] us rather then will he sweaters were
[1:30:12] great drops of blood and he said not my
[1:30:14] will time be done
[1:30:16] I'll tell you this because he had that
[1:30:18] anointing here that way with him in the
[1:30:21] flesh angel came and ministered to him
[1:30:24] there was a manger there to strengthen
[1:30:28] him to encourage you a man just think no
[1:30:32] doubt the angel knew this was God in
[1:30:33] flesh and the problem was the flesh
[1:30:37] brother it wasn't God even with the
[1:30:41] flesh in control he would have changed
[1:30:44] it but he didn't change it thank God
[1:30:47] hey man we're here because he said not
[1:30:50] my will then be done that's why we're
[1:30:53] here
[1:30:53] amen that's why that Luther did what he
[1:30:56] did Wesleyan and on down through the
[1:30:58] pentecostal now into the bride age a man
[1:31:02] and brother we're not going to
[1:31:04] experience it like the Pentecostals
[1:31:06] experience it sense of like the
[1:31:07] Pentecostals experience it or Luther or
[1:31:09] Wesley oh yeah because they added in
[1:31:11] their souls but they also experience it
[1:31:12] in their flesh and they they had
[1:31:14] feelings off beaming the anointing they
[1:31:19] felt the anointing as I said you can
[1:31:24] feel the anointing in your soul and
[1:31:27] brother what I felt in my soul one time
[1:31:30] I felt all around if I went outside it
[1:31:33] was still there it was there if I went
[1:31:35] to meet this brothers and sisters it was
[1:31:36] the anointing was there oh yeah and
[1:31:39] that's why the anointing was with you
[1:31:41] that's why yet then he even when you
[1:31:43] work with unbelievers back years ago
[1:31:44] even they recognize there was something
[1:31:46] different you created an atmosphere and
[1:31:50] it was newest t99 you Amen you create an
[1:31:55] atmosphere in school you create an
[1:31:58] atmosphere no matter where it is that
[1:32:00] where you're working and so on Amen
[1:32:01] because the anointing is on you and
[1:32:03] you're in the spirit hey man don't get
[1:32:06] out of the spirit because you're because
[1:32:08] you're gonna go to school don't get out
[1:32:09] of the spirit because you're gonna go to
[1:32:10] work don't get a despair because you're
[1:32:12] going to visit this one or that one when
[1:32:13] you stay with the spirit the anointing a
[1:32:16] man and I'll tell your brother if
[1:32:20] there's any spiritual in any way they'll
[1:32:21] recognize it and respect it they will
[1:32:26] so brother we got to do it because
[1:32:27] that's what God wants us to do not my
[1:32:29] will die and be done
[1:32:31] amen brother
[1:32:39] he said works is faith testimony and
[1:32:44] they said when they see you acting like
[1:32:47] you're healed
[1:32:49] then they'll know you got faith that you
[1:32:51] are healed amen
[1:32:56] works is faith expressed so what works
[1:33:00] are you doing what works are you
[1:33:01] manifesting is it not not just good
[1:33:05] works are going to church is what you're
[1:33:07] doing every day
[1:33:08] how you doing it when you do it where
[1:33:11] you do it and so on that's the works
[1:33:13] that God is looking at that's the works
[1:33:14] that God is influencing because it's not
[1:33:17] you living these cry is God living in
[1:33:18] you so brother has God in you is God
[1:33:22] doing this is God doing that because
[1:33:23] intellectually the devil oh you should
[1:33:26] do this because that'll be better for
[1:33:27] you no God honors you do sometimes why
[1:33:31] god what what God wants to do might in
[1:33:33] our mind might seem worse for us but at
[1:33:36] least it's going to improve our
[1:33:37] relationship with him
[1:33:39] amen so what why it's good is God
[1:33:42] testing our faith oh yeah
[1:33:45] God teste our faith I'll bring out a
[1:33:49] quote in a moment I I think and I saw my
[1:33:55] team I received from brother Matthew a
[1:33:56] brother Karsan
[1:33:57] but as a quote of the Prophet and it's
[1:34:02] in again I thank God for bringing us
[1:34:04] back to this message
[1:34:05] I have heard but now I see there's a
[1:34:08] reason for it because there's things in
[1:34:11] it that I didn't I liked and as I did in
[1:34:14] the last message here and there's
[1:34:17] another issue right here that this this
[1:34:19] is like a quote from her brother Isaac
[1:34:21] and and it's from the message right here
[1:34:27] or I have heard but now I see concerning
[1:34:31] what God does and how God does it
[1:34:34] before the test our faith amen gotta put
[1:34:40] you through the test to test your faith
[1:34:42] Carlo this Saturday they had to heaven
[1:34:44] what for to test your faith a man and
[1:34:47] brother it seemed like us or that's not
[1:34:50] so good but that's the prophet brought
[1:34:53] oh dear it was good for them that God
[1:34:56] was testing he didn't come out so good
[1:34:59] for those that he told about they are
[1:35:01] wells why because they they were selfish
[1:35:05] they want to do this they want to do
[1:35:06] that God wanted to do a certain way but
[1:35:09] they want to do it their way they want
[1:35:11] to make a big business out of it God no
[1:35:14] I just want them to do it so that they
[1:35:16] be blessed but God gave it to somebody
[1:35:19] else because their motive and their
[1:35:21] objective was wrong
[1:35:22] amen again this way and I brought it out
[1:35:26] and now and I think it was good he
[1:35:28] taught me those that were dead look
[1:35:29] looking for healing and he said why do
[1:35:31] you want to be healed
[1:35:32] what is your motor what's your objective
[1:35:36] many like I said they're there heal and
[1:35:38] go to hell but if your motor is right
[1:35:42] what what is your motive for the glory
[1:35:44] of God
[1:35:45] give God preeminence give God the glory
[1:35:49] not just so you can go to one I'm healed
[1:35:52] now so I can go do this I go to that
[1:35:53] know that God be glorified oh brother
[1:35:58] sister but the Prophet is bringing out
[1:36:03] concerning faith and works and orders so
[1:36:11] much he said work is
[1:36:18] testimony when they see you acting like
[1:36:20] you're healed they know you got faith
[1:36:21] that you are healed and he said if
[1:36:26] you're intellectuals always said here's
[1:36:29] a stinger if you're intellectuals does
[1:36:32] tell you that this is the truth God is
[1:36:36] the healer of sickness your mind go
[1:36:38] witness that that is the truth but if
[1:36:41] there is not the betting ground in your
[1:36:43] heart faint to fall him to express it
[1:36:47] will not happen they that's got to fall
[1:36:50] into the betting ground in your heart
[1:36:53] Amen now he said you remember he said
[1:36:58] you're in a cycle of three and he said
[1:37:01] you're one person and he said like
[1:37:03] Father Son and Holy Ghost he said cycle
[1:37:07] of three but he said one person and it
[1:37:10] said three attributes of the same God
[1:37:13] he said fatherhood and so on and he said
[1:37:18] three officers like him fatherhood
[1:37:21] sonship and Olli goes and he said you
[1:37:24] were a cycle of three as well and he
[1:37:29] said you our body spirit and soul amen
[1:37:35] if we're born again we'll focus on the
[1:37:38] soul not the body if you're not born
[1:37:41] again you're gonna focus more and more
[1:37:42] on your body and the natural life but
[1:37:45] not the spiritual and if you're born
[1:37:49] again you love the Lord and you love the
[1:37:52] family of God amen if you're born again
[1:37:56] and anything you want is fellowship amen
[1:37:59] by the grace of God oh yeah it's like I
[1:38:03] said that's not like it is now because
[1:38:06] there's the anointing the uniting the
[1:38:08] brighter 90 is less and less and less
[1:38:10] and one time we did where as I told my
[1:38:16] brother Billy Paul when I met him and
[1:38:18] he's all god bless you brother for what
[1:38:20] you've done as a brother I said all my
[1:38:23] life I said we have lived for this
[1:38:25] message I said we didn't live I said so
[1:38:29] we could do this and do this do they
[1:38:30] naturally I said we live to do what we
[1:38:33] could do for the Lord I said we we
[1:38:35] really we wanted waiting for this time
[1:38:38] so I could go down fellowship with this
[1:38:39] one waiting for that time so I'm going I
[1:38:41] fellowship with over whether it's the
[1:38:42] the the Saints in gamble the Saints in
[1:38:45] st. John's or let's say John's was the
[1:38:47] same thing in Fisher Falls the Saints
[1:38:49] that I western Newfoundland I said well
[1:38:51] all that's all we wanted to do and I
[1:38:53] said the believers live for that they
[1:38:56] were constantly on the go
[1:38:57] constantly undergo for one from one
[1:39:00] cottage to another from one group to
[1:39:02] another one group to another why cuz
[1:39:04] that's all they wanted and they talked
[1:39:06] about the Lord to talk with the word
[1:39:07] worship them praise the Lord I said but
[1:39:10] now I said there's very little of it
[1:39:13] they're too caught up with the natural
[1:39:15] world not the spiritual yeah brother
[1:39:20] it shows the lack of the new birth oh
[1:39:24] yeah that's why the father of God was
[1:39:28] experiencing his day when he said I got
[1:39:30] no friends why one time he it was always
[1:39:35] there but I was getting to the place
[1:39:36] where it was fewer a fewer of pure
[1:39:39] getting less right now we're living in
[1:39:44] that hour because people are more caught
[1:39:47] up with the natural things of life in
[1:39:49] the future we had in the in the early
[1:39:52] church who started this while ago he's
[1:39:55] an early church oh they went from house
[1:39:57] to house to house amen breaking the
[1:40:00] bread and doing this and fellowshipping
[1:40:02] and worshiping praise the Lord Alleluia
[1:40:05] oh yeah but the the bridal had that
[1:40:12] anointing but not all believers but the
[1:40:16] bride will and it controls the right
[1:40:20] brother
[1:40:23] what cycle is covered governing you
[1:40:27] father son Holy Ghost or is it the body
[1:40:30] the spirit or the soul and most are
[1:40:34] controlled by their body and the census
[1:40:37] of the body
[1:40:38] he said the outside body has five inlets
[1:40:42] to it to contact your earthly home see
[1:40:45] taste feel smell hear and he said the
[1:40:48] inside which is a spirit has five senses
[1:40:51] he said conscience love and so forth but
[1:40:56] inside of that the soul as one thing and
[1:40:59] he said that's where you live is in your
[1:41:02] soul and what is the sense of the soul
[1:41:05] faith
[1:41:06] the soul is only governed by faith it
[1:41:11] controls you
[1:41:12] by faith you're going by faith the
[1:41:15] revelation of the will of God for your
[1:41:17] life amen
[1:41:19] what is God's will for your life not my
[1:41:22] real father
[1:41:23] thine be done amen
[1:41:26] and brother the census of the soul of
[1:41:29] the Spirit rather is imagination
[1:41:32] conscience memory reason affection but
[1:41:37] we got to go beyond that to faith and
[1:41:40] sometimes faith is going to be is going
[1:41:43] to be contrary to all the senses
[1:41:45] contrary to the senses or instincts of
[1:41:47] your spirit and contrary to the
[1:41:49] instincts of your flesh brother faith is
[1:41:52] going to line us up with the Word of God
[1:41:54] the will of God amen
[1:41:57] perfect faith so he said the foal has
[1:42:02] one thing and he said that's where you
[1:42:04] live and it is faith and he said the
[1:42:07] spirit can come out and not you to do
[1:42:09] certain things and you do it but that
[1:42:12] don't mean you're saved
[1:42:14] he's to think of it k ephesus prophesied
[1:42:18] judas cast out devils and the spirit
[1:42:20] anointed him and there's rain falls on
[1:42:22] the just and the unjust and the weeds
[1:42:25] can rejoice with the wheat but it's what
[1:42:28] it is at the core

[1:42:36] what's in your garden well water it give
[1:42:40] it some soil it's the fertilizer yeah
[1:42:44] and then and let them get the sunshine

[1:42:50] to have sunshine

[1:42:57] break the seed and the cedar come forth

[1:43:15] lot of mowing to do to get rid of the

[1:43:32] gonna make the good the weeds come forth
[1:43:33] oh yeah definitely a man and they're
[1:43:36] gonna be there like the prophet of God
[1:43:38] warned us there's always three kinds of
[1:43:40] believers amen
[1:43:42] so brother sis I trust were believers in
[1:43:45] our hearts in our souls by the grace of
[1:43:47] God amen borned again and we're not
[1:43:51] going by feeling now we're going by
[1:43:53] faith so that's why back van there was
[1:43:56] fate but it but the atmosphere you would
[1:43:59] feel this you would feel this annoy me
[1:44:00] feel that annoy sense it you know around

[1:45:47] this make sure we're going to active
[1:45:48] think and talk like grass and grass is
[1:45:51] very simple it's very basic he meant and
[1:45:56] sometimes God said gotta use the mower a
[1:46:00] man to keep us on the right level by
[1:46:04] grace a man and we got to go round
[1:46:07] sometime with a I've got I've got one in
[1:46:10] my home there and it's a weed dealer
[1:46:14] there's you hold on you push it down
[1:46:16] twist it and pull the weed up not just
[1:46:20] the weed itself but the root that's what
[1:46:23] you want to get is the root I just
[1:46:25] plucked the weed and throw it out
[1:46:27] because it's gonna grow again cuz the
[1:46:29] roots are still there and it's not gonna
[1:46:31] change it's still gonna be a weed

[1:46:46] God and the Bride of Christ amen
[1:46:49] so knowing this oh yeah why is this seed
[1:46:53] there why is that see there because God
[1:46:54] planned it but the devil came behind in
[1:46:56] planted weeds
[1:46:58] oh yeah there's lots of weeds Oh
[1:47:02] that'll help us to better understand our
[1:47:07] life better understand the walk we're in
[1:47:09] a man the message were identified with
[1:47:12] when you look right on your we look out
[1:47:14] your window on your grass now you'll
[1:47:16] think about that now where am i over
[1:47:19] there
[1:47:19] I trust that I'm not one of those weeds
[1:47:23] I'm trust I trusted I'm the rich grass
[1:47:26] that's coming up hallelujah praise the
[1:47:30] name of the Lord he said the weeds can
[1:47:37] rejoice with the wheat but it's what it
[1:47:42] is at the core
[1:47:43] he said there's where you can
[1:47:45] intellectuals can accept and say oh sure
[1:47:48] that looks good
[1:47:49] I believe that that still don't do it
[1:47:52] and the Spirit can actually he said make
[1:47:55] witness of it and still it isn't so
[1:47:58] because if that soul hasn't come from
[1:48:01] God it can make all the impersonations
[1:48:04] out here but it cannot be real trusting
[1:48:09] by grace that we are the seed of God
[1:48:13] amen he says you can Act evening you can
[1:48:19] act like you have you can act like you
[1:48:22] have received it Christians can act like
[1:48:24] they are Christians and act and be ever
[1:48:26] so good at it but that don't mean
[1:48:29] they're saved
[1:48:30] he said that's actually right the Spirit
[1:48:33] can be there the real genuine spirit the
[1:48:35] Holy Spirit can anoint you and that
[1:48:37] still don't mean you're saved it's that
[1:48:39] inside soul that never dies
[1:48:42] he said it's got eternal life it always
[1:48:45] was eternal he said life it come from
[1:48:48] God it goes to God it's your soul that's
[1:48:52] the part that God is working on it's the
[1:48:55] soul a man so when you go out and you
[1:48:58] live this life you act this life you've
[1:49:00] got this testimony of this witness and
[1:49:02] so on
[1:49:03] what brother and again it's not you it's
[1:49:05] God in your soul he's in control amen
[1:49:10] oh brother sister let's hear it the way
[1:49:14] God wants us to hear it let's see it the
[1:49:16] way God wants us to see it and let's
[1:49:18] have the right motive and the right
[1:49:20] objective as I said I think of a brother
[1:49:28] Matthew our latest on scripture there
[1:49:30] concerning the rich young ruler his
[1:49:36] motive was right his objective was wrong
[1:49:41] he didn't want he didn't want to have to
[1:49:43] pay the price that God Jesus told him he
[1:49:45] had to pay he didn't want do that he
[1:49:49] felt you know well god bless me God will
[1:49:51] do this and God do that yeah but he had
[1:49:54] to be in the will of God you got to have
[1:49:57] a right motor and a right objective he
[1:50:01] had the yeah the emphasis on himself
[1:50:03] amen but Jesus wanted to put the
[1:50:06] emphasis on the Lord give preeminence to
[1:50:11] the Lord in your life so it's not you
[1:50:14] it's God why does this brother this
[1:50:18] sister do this why do they act this way
[1:50:19] why do they talk like that why are they
[1:50:21] doing this well it's the Lord it's not
[1:50:25] the way human beings wouldn't
[1:50:26] intellectually do this in lecture did
[1:50:28] that no but brother you're not
[1:50:30] controlled by the end of like you're
[1:50:31] controlled by the soul the spirit the
[1:50:34] Holy Spirit you consider the way that
[1:50:38] God has ladies set his sons and
[1:50:39] daughters down through the ages Old
[1:50:41] Testament read consider and today
[1:50:45] believers st. oh if we got God God what
[1:50:47] we want to have to endure that we wanted
[1:50:49] to experience that oh yes brother I'll
[1:50:53] tell you this if you go what we want joy
[1:50:55] hallelujah we want to we want to love
[1:50:57] the Lord won't be guden and enjoy this
[1:51:00] and enjoy it yeah well if you got the
[1:51:01] Holy Ghost you enjoyed in here yeah it's
[1:51:06] like that like that woman where they
[1:51:07] said if you don't repent recant
[1:51:10] we're gonna kill your daughter well she
[1:51:12] said kill her she said I'll meet her in
[1:51:14] glory yeah any man she was rejoicing she
[1:51:20] was praising the Lord and again like I
[1:51:22] told you about the man that they were
[1:51:24] stretching and stretching the stretching
[1:51:26] to wait until he would break apart man
[1:51:29] they looked at him and he wasn't crying
[1:51:31] he was just happy
[1:51:33] oh my wasn't he happy oh yeah
[1:51:37] and people think today that God is gonna
[1:51:38] make me happy God's gonna God is gonna
[1:51:40] make make this good and this Gooden and
[1:51:42] in here Oh everything will be for my
[1:51:44] favor no it's the grace of God not the
[1:51:50] grace of the devil another grace of man
[1:51:52] and so on or they think of this I'll be
[1:51:55] good
[1:51:55] no that's not a brother or that the
[1:52:00] brother I lighted that in this quote
[1:52:02] right here from the message I have heard
[1:52:05] but now I see we go conclusion ah I'll
[1:52:09] give you that
[1:52:10] I'll share that quote with it Amen so
[1:52:14] God give us the faith so we're being led
[1:52:17] by the spirit not being led by the flesh
[1:52:20] amen
[1:52:21] led by the Holy Ghost not being led by
[1:52:23] the human nature you got a man by the
[1:52:26] grace of Almighty God brothers sister
[1:52:28] god help us again as I said go through
[1:52:34] and you see what God what God does how
[1:52:36] God does it but yet it gives joy to the
[1:52:41] believer oh yeah they joy and rejoice
[1:52:46] that their that the Lord count them
[1:52:48] worthy that they would suffer for his
[1:52:50] name's sake thank you Jesus
[1:52:53] it's joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:52:56] like I said we think joy and good and
[1:52:59] not happy is when we we think everything
[1:53:02] is there to please the flesh no no what
[1:53:05] brings us happiness only goes happiness
[1:53:07] is what pleases the soul amen during
[1:53:11] right what you're in right standing with
[1:53:13] God that's why you're happy amen you all
[1:53:17] may not look and see this good app and
[1:53:19] this good happen in your in your
[1:53:20] physical being but they don't make it
[1:53:22] ever so long as long as I mean in the
[1:53:24] will of God praise the Lord O God help
[1:53:28] us to have a right mind
[1:53:29] Alvis have a right spirit Alfa's to have
[1:53:32] revelation Holy Ghost revelation Amen
[1:53:35] not natural the
[1:53:37] spiritual praise the Lord he said
[1:53:46] there's where your can intellectuals can
[1:53:49] accept and say oh sure that's good I
[1:53:51] believe that that still don't do it and
[1:53:55] the spirit actually make witness of it
[1:53:57] and it still isn't so because if that
[1:54:00] soul hasn't come from God
[1:54:02] it can make all the impersonations out
[1:54:04] here but it cannot be real you can act
[1:54:08] healing you can act like you have and
[1:54:11] act like you receive it Christians can
[1:54:13] act like they are Christians and act and
[1:54:15] be ever so good at it but that don't
[1:54:17] mean you're they're saved the spirit can
[1:54:20] be there the real genuine spirit the
[1:54:22] Holy Spirit can anoint you that still
[1:54:24] don't mean you're saved it's that inside
[1:54:27] soul that never dies it's got eternal
[1:54:30] life it's always was eternal life and it
[1:54:34] comes from God it goes to God it's the
[1:54:36] soul amen
[1:54:38] but see when it's direct directed from
[1:54:41] the inside it throws all the rest of it
[1:54:43] together and he said that's the
[1:54:45] guidepost that's the control tower the
[1:54:48] inside of the inside the soul controls
[1:54:51] the spirit and the spirit controls the
[1:54:54] body amen grace of God amen he said if
[1:55:03] your faith doesn't produce works with it
[1:55:06] you can't make anyone believe that
[1:55:08] you're healed amen
[1:55:13] God have mercy on us
[1:55:15] he said all be rugged Christians he said
[1:55:19] like we should be and if we were man and
[1:55:22] women you take God at His Word you can't
[1:55:25] do it on til it's revealed to you amen
[1:55:28] you take God at His Word you don't stay
[1:55:34] here at the promise of God through
[1:55:36] unbelief but you give praise to God and
[1:55:38] know that it's got to happen I don't
[1:55:41] care what the doctor says everything
[1:55:43] else will come in all kind of a way but
[1:55:45] don't you believe it it's a lie of the
[1:55:47] devil
[1:55:48] heesu faith goes about to get
[1:55:51] with works to create the promise a man
[1:55:55] the promise of God and I know this is of
[1:56:03] God because this another scripture point
[1:56:05] to this hour
[1:56:07] revelation 10 and he said in that in the
[1:56:10] hour of the seventh angels message when
[1:56:13] he begins to sound forth his message not
[1:56:16] in a healing service but the message
[1:56:19] that follows the healing service amen
[1:56:22] what follows the healing service the
[1:56:24] faith of the Resurrection and the
[1:56:25] rapture we're getting out of that signs
[1:56:28] and wonders for the natural man into the
[1:56:31] spiritual the natural wants healing
[1:56:35] that's that's why that they put so much
[1:56:38] emphasis on Billy Oral Roberts rather
[1:56:40] his ministry signs and wonders and
[1:56:42] healing and the public God did put the
[1:56:47] emphasis on the first two signs they men
[1:56:50] remember the angel said you'll do this
[1:56:51] you do this but he said get the people
[1:56:54] to believe that was to get their
[1:56:57] attention
[1:56:57] now get them to believe the revealed
[1:56:59] word amen and even Oral Roberts came to
[1:57:05] brother Branham and he said brother
[1:57:07] Branham he said you've got to stop
[1:57:09] preaching those things that you preach
[1:57:13] yeah and he said just just use your sign
[1:57:17] just go pray for the sick and brother
[1:57:20] Branham said brother he said he said
[1:57:24] where the graham said leave it Billy
[1:57:26] Graham but or Robert she said leave it
[1:57:29] with the leader with the pastors and the
[1:57:32] ministry and he said well he said
[1:57:35] brother what if the ministry is not
[1:57:36] preaching he says somebody gotta preach
[1:57:38] it so he's talking about a preacher and
[1:57:41] that's eating around the message now to
[1:57:43] preaching doctrine and theology but
[1:57:46] really not preaching what God requires
[1:57:49] of the bride for the resurrection and
[1:57:51] the rapture well yeah it's a lining out
[1:57:56] remember the last as I mentioned on
[1:57:58] Wednesday the last vision the prophet of
[1:58:00] God was screaming to the bride the last
[1:58:02] message to the bride
[1:58:03] my stay in line that was his last
[1:58:07] message to the right because he saw some
[1:58:13] of them getting out of life and many a
[1:58:16] believers gotten out of line grace to us
[1:58:24] and he said when that meant angel that
[1:58:27] seven angels message when he begins to
[1:58:29] sound for these message not in a healing
[1:58:31] service but the message that follows the
[1:58:35] healing service
[1:58:36] amen to get us to believe the word amen
[1:58:40] and that's what Jesus did in his
[1:58:42] ministry signs and wonders and then he
[1:58:45] given the word and they turned down the
[1:58:47] word amen the accuse them of being a
[1:58:51] false prophet but he said you're fewer
[1:58:54] you're false
[1:58:56] he said just think what Jesus said
[1:58:59] nearing the end of his ministry how hard
[1:59:02] it gets he said you are of your father
[1:59:05] the devil what area is talking to the
[1:59:09] ministry and they had this Jews
[1:59:12] religious Jews and so on
[1:59:14] you're of your father the devil what
[1:59:17] amazing that's what it comes down to
[1:59:22] that's what everything is is as come
[1:59:24] down when it's coming down to more and
[1:59:25] more you're under either under God's
[1:59:27] influence or the devil's influence grace
[1:59:30] to us
[1:59:39] amen we need third pull faith and that's
[1:59:48] the faith that doesn't question God just
[1:59:50] believes God regardless he said I can't
[1:59:55] make you believe neither can you make
[1:59:57] yourself believe God has got to give it
[2:00:00] to you it's a gift of God to believe not
[2:00:04] your faith God's faith your intellectual
[2:00:07] faith might believe it fine but unless
[2:00:09] the faith of God is in is down in your
[2:00:12] heart your intellectual faith can accept
[2:00:15] to do that and just keep believing it
[2:00:18] with all your heart under God does
[2:00:20] reveal it to you just keep believing it
[2:00:22] until God reveals it amen keep believing
[2:00:27] the resurrection rapture till God makes
[2:00:30] it a reality in our lives and in the
[2:00:35] invisible union of the breath of the
[2:00:36] church the bride to Christ that
[2:00:38] messenger is here now which is Jesus
[2:00:41] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:00:44] forever
[2:00:44] a lot of people think is William Brennan
[2:00:46] no it's Jesus William Graham didn't do
[2:00:49] that Jesus did it it was Christ
[2:00:52] revealing himself a man price praise the
[2:00:55] name of the Lord thank God for the
[2:00:57] revelation of Christ brother if we see
[2:01:04] Christ in the reveal word we're hearing
[2:01:06] it the way God wants to stare at see it
[2:01:08] the way God wants us to see it and I'll
[2:01:10] turn to this it'll produce the right
[2:01:12] mode of an objective in our lives that
[2:01:16] we're not living for ourselves we're not
[2:01:18] living just for to show off to the
[2:01:19] others
[2:01:20] we're living for the Lord to give
[2:01:22] preeminence to Jesus by the grace of God
[2:01:25] amen
[2:01:26] Oh we'll have to get back to great motor
[2:01:33] of an objective maybe on Wednesday and
[2:01:35] try to finish it
[2:01:36] amen in the message doing God a service
[2:01:42] without his will the
[2:01:48] God says were in the end time the Lord
[2:01:51] bless you richly he said I get started
[2:01:54] and he said we're going to fade pretty
[2:01:57] quickly into eternity amen well that's
[2:02:03] what's going on now the right is fading
[2:02:05] into eternity that's why we don't feel
[2:02:06] the anointing like they used to out
[2:02:08] there in the atmosphere and around
[2:02:10] everywhere because the anointing was on
[2:02:12] the Pentecostals everywhere 90 was maybe
[2:02:15] in Luther West they stay on the
[2:02:17] Methodists everywhere and you could
[2:02:19] sense that anointing it was it was all
[2:02:21] over the world and the anointing of the
[2:02:25] prophets of Malachi for the anointing
[2:02:27] was all of the world but now it's gone
[2:02:29] now it's just in the bright Amen so we
[2:02:35] said we're going to fade pretty quickly
[2:02:37] into eternity
[2:02:40] he said notice the scripture that says
[2:02:42] in vain do they worship Me teaching for
[2:02:47] doctrines the commandments of man but it
[2:02:51] says they worship Me this makes sure
[2:02:55] we're not worshipping God in vain amen
[2:02:58] as God blessed us into going forth of
[2:03:00] the song service and the an you
[2:03:03] worshiped and you praise the Lord praise
[2:03:05] God hallelujah thank you Jesus let's
[2:03:09] make sure it is not in vain amen
[2:03:16] he said God
[2:03:18] sovereign and he said we see here what
[2:03:23] David done in the scripture reading of
[2:03:26] 1st chronicles 13 and his intentions
[2:03:30] were good but God does not give us
[2:03:34] mirrors on good intentions he said
[2:03:38] there's only one way to serve God and
[2:03:40] that's why doing his will at his command
[2:03:43] and God being sovereign there's no one
[2:03:46] to tell him what to do or how to do it
[2:03:49] he does it his way
[2:03:53] he knows the right way to do it and that
[2:03:55] makes me feel good and it ought to make
[2:03:58] all of us feel good he said for one
[2:04:01] would have it coming in this way and one
[2:04:03] would have it going that way and one the
[2:04:05] other way but one great thing again
[2:04:08] about God has not left us now without
[2:04:12] knowing what's the truth and how to do
[2:04:14] it
[2:04:16] it says God knows what's best God knows
[2:04:20] when to do it and God knows outer to it
[2:04:23] we have our ideas but he knows is a man
[2:04:29] it's his idea not ours
[2:04:32] that's what we got to allow to govern us
[2:04:36] and he said old brother listen what time
[2:04:41] are we living in what's the age what's
[2:04:43] the hour that we are in it's not time
[2:04:46] for it for these things that they are
[2:04:48] talking about these are less passed and
[2:04:51] he said judgment is on end right now and
[2:04:54] he says you can see it breaking and you
[2:04:57] remember the rock upon the mountain
[2:04:59] judgment hour you remember the
[2:05:01] revelation of the vision of the bride
[2:05:03] just keep her in step don't better get
[2:05:07] out of step we're living in the judgment
[2:05:10] hour that's why we pray grace to family
[2:05:13] friends and neighbors because the
[2:05:15] Prophet said as long as the bride is
[2:05:17] here there's grace so it's you
[2:05:22] representing the grace of God and we're
[2:05:25] looking for what we're looking for that
[2:05:27] last predestinated seat
[2:05:28] or as william branham said some years
[2:05:32] ago in that if that last seed were to
[2:05:35] come in either tonight he said he said
[2:05:39] it might have been in Florida or some
[2:05:41] might be up in Washington he said he
[2:05:44] said we'll go on preaching and he said
[2:05:46] Derby nobody saved he's the last one is
[2:05:49] he in he still be nobody saved and he
[2:05:52] said we'll go on preaching and he said
[2:05:54] for a period of time until that that
[2:05:56] last one in he said comes to maturity to
[2:06:01] recognize God recognize his word and
[2:06:04] maybe were here waiting for seed of God
[2:06:08] here these these our young sisters and
[2:06:12] our young brothers waiting for them to
[2:06:14] come to maturity this relief pitcher
[2:06:19] elected seed your predestinated see and
[2:06:22] God's waiting for you to come to the
[2:06:23] maturity to believe God believe his word
[2:06:26] recognized it accepted Amen and live it
[2:06:30] and he said we could go on preaching he
[2:06:33] said they could go on preaching for two
[2:06:35] hundred years he said there won't be
[2:06:36] another one saved amazing brother it
[2:06:41] doesn't surprise me
[2:06:41] considering the hour were living thank
[2:06:46] God for the young people in this church
[2:06:48] even as I said before visiting ministers
[2:06:51] I think that that sort of shocks them
[2:06:56] when they look and they see our Zhong
[2:06:58] sisters here worshiping their hands
[2:07:00] raised and then and and the children in
[2:07:04] the church today and one brother said
[2:07:07] brother well you don't see too many
[2:07:09] churches like this I said good nice -
[2:07:13] thank the Lord I said that we haven't by
[2:07:15] grace of God a man and of course he was
[2:07:18] shocked a - and when one brother was
[2:07:22] here and he noticed one of our young
[2:07:23] brothers was up there helping brother
[2:07:25] Matthew that was brother Adam son Daniel
[2:07:28] Daniel yeah and so on amazing that
[2:07:33] that's on earth I mean most of most
[2:07:34] churches yeah so thank God for the
[2:07:38] anointing please
[2:07:39] keep pleading the token for one another
[2:07:41] and keep pleading the token for the
[2:07:44] children for your sons your daughters
[2:07:46] yes or for the for your grandchildren
[2:07:50] yes God God's expecting you to do that
[2:07:53] see in your hands is in your hands a man
[2:07:58] the grace of God brother I try to bring
[2:08:02] it to a conclusion yes there's five mas
[2:08:10] I want you to enter these no matter how
[2:08:13] sincere a man may be in doing it doing
[2:08:15] God a service he said they said these
[2:08:17] five mus must be there if you ever do
[2:08:24] God a service not without his will if
[2:08:28] you're gonna do it with his will there's
[2:08:30] five months it must be his time to do it
[2:08:36] amen
[2:08:38] it must be according to his word that
[2:08:45] has been spoken so make sure it's God's
[2:08:49] time whatever you do wherever you feel
[2:08:51] led to do make sure it's God's time make
[2:08:54] sure it's according to the word that's
[2:08:56] been ministered and preached and he said
[2:08:59] it must be given according to the person
[2:09:02] he has chosen to give it by don't see
[2:09:08] that and it must come first to his
[2:09:13] prophets
[2:09:14] so what we're preaching did come first
[2:09:17] two prophets a man and the Prophet must
[2:09:22] be a vindicated by the word he men and
[2:09:27] he was it wasn't just the Ministry of a
[2:09:30] man it was the Ministry of God in the
[2:09:32] Prophet amen he said we are in the last
[2:09:38] days were standing near the judgment and
[2:09:40] we're trying to eat an old man of the
[2:09:42] fill back yonder fifty years ago the
[2:09:45] Pentecostal church the Holiness Church
[2:09:47] is trying over 200 years ago the
[2:09:49] Lutheran's about three or more hundred
[2:09:51] years ago
[2:09:52] and he said there eat trying to eat old
[2:09:55] manner but no we need to come into the
[2:09:57] Holy of Holies to get the fresh manna of
[2:10:00] the revealed word hallelujah
[2:10:02] how if Jesus did anything you know what
[2:10:05] he did he took the veil down when he did
[2:10:07] when he laid down his life God ripped
[2:10:11] the veil in the temple that was between
[2:10:13] the holy place and the holy of holies
[2:10:15] that shocked the priesthood what because
[2:10:19] they weren't allowed in there only the
[2:10:20] high priest would go in once a year and
[2:10:21] he had to have a rope on him and he had
[2:10:24] to have chimes on his leg there so when
[2:10:26] he would he would walk and do make a
[2:10:28] certain sound and if anything happened
[2:10:30] they would add the drag amount why
[2:10:32] because in there was the Ark of the
[2:10:34] Covenant and was to angels and the
[2:10:36] purifier in between those angels a man
[2:10:39] and then they were see there was the in
[2:10:41] manner right there yeah that they had
[2:10:45] put in there and and and the high priest
[2:10:48] could take a bit of that in mana and eat
[2:10:51] it
[2:10:51] he had never got never got bad or
[2:10:54] anything not in there the presence of
[2:10:57] God brother and how God has brought us
[2:11:00] into the Holy of Holies praise the Lord
[2:11:03] so that we can eat the hidden manna of
[2:11:07] the revealed word this is tremendous
[2:11:09] this is a whole scriptural this is
[2:11:12] exactly according to the Bible according
[2:11:13] to the Word of God a man thank God for
[2:11:17] the Holy of Holies and brother in the
[2:11:20] Holy of Holies we become one with the
[2:11:23] pillar fire one with Christ praise the
[2:11:26] Lord they don't have to worry about
[2:11:29] dragging us out he's gonna drag us in
[2:11:32] and he's going to take us into into the
[2:11:35] resurrection into the rapture praise the
[2:11:37] name of the Lord hallelujah so we're
[2:11:42] standing near the judgment we're trying
[2:11:43] to eat old manna that fell back yonder
[2:11:46] 50 years ago the Pentecostal church the
[2:11:49] Holiness Church was people trying to eat
[2:11:51] hidden manna at home and I hidden manna
[2:11:53] old manna that well basic message
[2:11:58] doctrines and theology and teaching from
[2:12:00] 50 years ago or even 40 years ago we
[2:12:03] need to get into the revelation now
[2:12:05] brother what God
[2:12:06] did God is making flesh in the bright
[2:12:09] house not gone when Brad was gone
[2:12:12] goddess Taylor Jesus still there he's in
[2:12:14] his bride it lets go forth as Jesus a
[2:12:18] man he says find out if David if any of
[2:12:24] the rest of them would only consulted
[2:12:26] the bread of the hour if the priests and
[2:12:28] prophets and preachers and theologians
[2:12:30] and schools and denominations would have
[2:12:33] only consulted the hour and but now it
[2:12:35] won't do them no good it done moved out
[2:12:38] it won't help a bit and if she's gone
[2:12:41] now she's crossed that line about five
[2:12:43] years ago between repentance judgment
[2:12:46] and mercy
[2:12:47] five years ago that would have been 1960
[2:12:53] you know 1960 she crossed the line
[2:12:57] between mercy and judgment brother God's
[2:13:01] grace to us well I believe churches have
[2:13:08] crossed the line
[2:13:09] governments across the line and that's
[2:13:12] why that we're in the our judgment and
[2:13:14] we see the fire falling that's why
[2:13:16] they're talking about the meters from
[2:13:18] outer space they're coming to strike the
[2:13:19] earth we're getting to the place where
[2:13:22] there's gonna be a new heaven and a new
[2:13:23] earth please let's be let's be ready for
[2:13:27] it let's be on our guard let's be ready
[2:13:30] for it let's love the Lord anything God
[2:13:32] looking for in this hour he's looking
[2:13:34] for you to love him he is again that's
[2:13:40] like Peter I said Paul look look I knew
[2:13:43] God chose to be the messenger Paul and
[2:13:47] now they'll go he chose two big preach
[2:13:52] the first message on the day of
[2:13:54] Pentecost Peter he had more trouble with
[2:13:57] Peter than yet he knew with the rest we
[2:14:01] know we know that we're not even told
[2:14:02] any there any issues that he had with
[2:14:05] Judas it's very very little until he
[2:14:09] went to betray him but and any of the
[2:14:13] other disciples well with Peter Peter
[2:14:16] was always questioning this questioning
[2:14:17] that what about this what about that
[2:14:19] what did you do this what would you do
[2:14:21] that and to finally when he come back he
[2:14:24] said yes why he asked him three times
[2:14:26] lovest thou me more than these they men
[2:14:30] until he talked to talk to the finally
[2:14:32] concluded with divine law that's what he
[2:14:40] was looking for in Peter Peter added and
[2:14:42] human love but he was looking for divine
[2:14:45] law so when he came back and from the
[2:14:49] resurrection and he went to Peter and
[2:14:51] they fellowship and talked he brought
[2:14:53] out of Peter divine law a man it's
[2:14:59] amazing just consider those whom God
[2:15:02] uses I'll tell you this it's not what we
[2:15:06] choose not what you would choose but I
[2:15:09] tell you find out who God chooses
[2:15:12] yeah-oh him/her no yeah be careful
[2:15:18] except that people care could be the one
[2:15:19] God is using to bless you to help you to
[2:15:25] encourage you to teach you yeah
[2:15:27] amazing you type of God hidden and God
[2:15:32] revealed in simplicity we want to make
[2:15:38] it this person this person that person
[2:15:39] no God said moved that one side take
[2:15:42] this one
[2:15:42] what yeah I want Peter yeah he knew
[2:15:48] Peter's heart god help us any new Paul's
[2:15:53] heart Oh Paul he's cruel
[2:15:56] he's killed Oh many many believers he's
[2:16:00] killed and so on and he was on his way
[2:16:03] to kill more when God called him God
[2:16:06] stepped on the scene a man a man a man
[2:16:09] brother I'll tend to this you talk about
[2:16:12] we are sinners saved by grace Paul that
[2:16:19] was real to Paul I believe it was real
[2:16:21] to Peter
[2:16:24] he said watch the vision the other night
[2:16:27] exactly the same bride comes this side
[2:16:30] come to this side after that prostitutes
[2:16:34] pass with their own gowns and little old
[2:16:37] things just this way dancing Roy rock
[2:16:39] and roll calling themselves the church
[2:16:41] and you say well we don't do that that's
[2:16:45] the way God sees you it ain't what you
[2:16:48] see you're your own self it's the way
[2:16:50] God sees you no man sees himself wrong
[2:16:53] so how do you see yourself in all
[2:17:00] circumstances situations please if
[2:17:02] there's anything you do or don't do
[2:17:05] don't ever consider yourself to be
[2:17:08] better than anybody else you know
[2:17:11] they're sinners saved by grace you're a
[2:17:13] sinner saved by grace
[2:17:14] yes concluded all under sin that he may
[2:17:20] have mercy on all why so they'd all had
[2:17:23] the same attitude in the same spirit
[2:17:24] that's right oh I didn't do this I
[2:17:27] didn't do that no but you were born in
[2:17:30] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[2:17:36] speaking like well I'm going to you what
[2:17:38] do you think you're so good there's none
[2:17:40] righteous no not one
[2:17:43] it's only Jesus and it's our by our
[2:17:46] faith he appears his righteousness to us
[2:17:49] let's give the glory to God
[2:18:00] he says not the years in preparation but
[2:18:03] it's when he begins to sound the message
[2:18:06] these mysteries will be revealed well
[2:18:10] God has done that it's revealed down and
[2:18:15] God's looking for the manifestation and
[2:18:17] what he has done he's looking for the
[2:18:20] manifestation in the bright by the grace
[2:18:23] of God grace he said the word evening
[2:18:33] message must-carry evening results the
[2:18:36] evening message must sow evening seeds
[2:18:38] not morning seed evening seed it is
[2:18:43] evening results and he said the
[2:18:46] beginning message showed the beginning
[2:18:48] result made creation he made his son in
[2:18:52] his own image in the midday and in the
[2:18:54] evening time he makes a bride for the
[2:18:56] son he said he makes the bride by his
[2:19:01] word amen he said don't never start or
[2:19:09] try an organization don't try to build
[2:19:11] up anything but stay humble before the
[2:19:14] Lord your God for it looks like the
[2:19:16] gates may open on to the promised land
[2:19:18] soon and then let us go in with true
[2:19:21] singing and rejoicing when the bride and
[2:19:24] the groom takes its place at the throne
[2:19:26] live humble and he said loving love one
[2:19:33] another don't never get nothing among
[2:19:35] you if you see something come up in your
[2:19:38] heart against somebody he said get it
[2:19:41] out right then and Satan will do his
[2:19:45] best to get among you don't you let that
[2:19:49] happen some slick dumb fellow may come
[2:19:51] along and try to take you away from it
[2:19:54] and he said you think they could talk
[2:19:56] Moses out of the presence of God where
[2:19:58] he stood there and seen it no sir no we
[2:20:02] don't take from from it or add to it
[2:20:05] just keep it the way the Lord said it
[2:20:07] and he said we don't want no
[2:20:08] denomination we don't want an
[2:20:10] organization we don't want no malice we
[2:20:13] don't want no strife we want God and II
[2:20:15] is the word a man he said look with a
[2:20:20] spiritual high he said don't do you done
[2:20:27] what you said look Lord far be it from
[2:20:30] us trying to make it any littler or to
[2:20:33] try to make it any bigger just keep it
[2:20:35] the way that it is you made it
[2:20:38] just walk humble and follow you and my
[2:20:42] and Lord may our hearts continually be
[2:20:46] set on thee we know Lord that money
[2:20:50] prosperity property things of the world
[2:20:54] have no meanings just so temporal all of
[2:20:58] them must go our jobs our places our
[2:21:01] friends everything must go no matter how
[2:21:04] rich or poor a popular a lone popular
[2:21:08] with that we are it all must go but
[2:21:11] there's only one thing that our be near
[2:21:13] is centered around and that is Jesus
[2:21:16] Christ he said so God let us lay aside
[2:21:19] everything that secondarily and hold to
[2:21:22] him he is the word is the vindicated
[2:21:26] word of the hour well it's a question as
[2:21:34] he got near the end of his message
[2:21:42] yeah he knew he was dealing with a
[2:21:45] congregation that was caught up with the
[2:21:47] natural things of life oh I gotta do
[2:21:52] this I gotta do that and he said how he
[2:21:59] said have you forgotten about dinner oh
[2:22:05] it's dinner time no he said have you
[2:22:09] forgotten about dinner he wanted them to
[2:22:13] forget dinner focus on the Lord he said
[2:22:18] have you forgotten whether the kids are
[2:22:20] all right out in the car or not
[2:22:22] have you forgotten all about the past
[2:22:25] and realized what that is your feeling
[2:22:28] right now it's materializing before you
[2:22:30] day and night and let that be the center
[2:22:33] he's Alette the rest of the things go
[2:22:36] away he said they're going to perish
[2:22:39] anyhow and he said just keep following
[2:22:41] him as Elijah followed Elijah let's
[2:22:45] follow him for we must be taken up to
[2:22:48] some day we see the chariot of fire that
[2:22:51] lifted him out of the grief we feel it
[2:22:53] now among us and some day he's going to
[2:22:56] be going to on hook and the horses from
[2:22:59] the brushes we are going hop amen
[2:23:04] well it was the AUSA's chariot and
[2:23:08] horses of theophanies that coddle Idaho
[2:23:12] well it's gonna be theophanies that's
[2:23:15] gonna catch the brighter the alpha niece
[2:23:17] of the saints that are gone on and your
[2:23:20] theophany might theophany that's waiting
[2:23:21] for us in that dimension amen
[2:23:24] again I'll finish with this scripture we
[2:23:31] read it before
[2:23:38] hey man the old I show you a mystery we
[2:23:46] shall not all sleep but we shall be
[2:23:51] changed
[2:23:52] a man in a moment in the twinkling of an
[2:23:56] eye at the last Trump amazing for the
[2:24:01] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[2:24:04] be raised incorruptible and we shall be
[2:24:08] changed
[2:24:09] brother were into the faith and
[2:24:13] revelation of the resurrection and the
[2:24:15] rapture what's going on right now
[2:24:16] brother the resurrection is going on now
[2:24:18] the rapture is going on now
[2:24:20] brother because we've heard the last
[2:24:22] Trump
[2:24:23] it has sounded and the dead of Christ
[2:24:26] are being raised incorruptible and then
[2:24:29] we shall be changed for this corruptible
[2:24:31] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[2:24:34] must put on immortality amen
[2:24:40] the quote that I said I was going to
[2:24:42] give you and it's from the message I
[2:24:45] have heard but now I see and his quote
[2:24:47] one 11111 and he said now we find that
[2:24:54] in the those hours of real stress I
[2:25:00] might have he under stress but he's
[2:25:05] sitting in those hours of real stress he
[2:25:09] said that's usually when the Spirit of
[2:25:12] God moves him amen and he let the Hebrew
[2:25:19] children walk right into the fiery
[2:25:22] furnace before he ever moved a hand they
[2:25:32] didn't see him until they got there so
[2:25:37] in our situations circumstances we don't
[2:25:40] see him we don't sense his presence with
[2:25:42] us until we're right in the midst of
[2:25:45] distress oh yeah we're right in there if
[2:25:48] we think all of God's with me you won't
[2:25:50] let me go through that
[2:25:51] but he does to bring up your faith this
[2:25:55] stress this test so on to bring out your
[2:25:58] faith and through the three blue
[2:25:59] children they we're gonna eat it seven
[2:26:01] times hotter weather that's fine we're
[2:26:04] still not going to do this we're not
[2:26:06] gonna do that
[2:26:06] and they they hated it so much that when
[2:26:09] those that threw the children in they
[2:26:13] died for the truth is amazing that the
[2:26:17] children that didn't feel it the heat
[2:26:20] struck them so hard that the soldiers
[2:26:24] died but the cerebral children just when
[2:26:29] Arnie did throw them into the furnace
[2:26:33] they didn't feel no heat and the finally
[2:26:37] they looked around and here was God he
[2:26:42] was the fourth corn and he was he was
[2:26:45] walking around with them yeah and the
[2:26:50] King said all he's I heard you through
[2:26:52] three and he said I see four down there
[2:26:56] walking Amen when we're in when we're in
[2:27:02] stress when we're going through a hard
[2:27:03] time and rough times how many does the
[2:27:07] devil see just you or you and God just
[2:27:12] you are you and Jesus Amen well he said
[2:27:18] he let the Hebrew children walk right on
[2:27:20] into the fiery furnace before he ever
[2:27:23] moved a hand but he said listen when he
[2:27:26] moved he moves when God moves he moves
[2:27:31] he's there amen
[2:27:33] so what God moves into in your life he
[2:27:36] moves a man so sometimes it's not in
[2:27:40] terms when everything's going well we
[2:27:42] thought go go good good good good you
[2:27:44] know sometimes when things are seeming
[2:27:45] the bad bad bad all his hard hard hurt
[2:27:49] but Jesus is there to encourage you they
[2:27:53] see Jesus was there to help you
[2:27:55] a man Jesus there to give you relief
[2:28:00] going through this trial going for this
[2:28:03] test but I'm relieved praise them
[2:28:05] or spiritually because Jesus is here
[2:28:06] with me and I know these won't take me
[2:28:09] through it by the grace of God no matter
[2:28:11] what the test is no matter what you're
