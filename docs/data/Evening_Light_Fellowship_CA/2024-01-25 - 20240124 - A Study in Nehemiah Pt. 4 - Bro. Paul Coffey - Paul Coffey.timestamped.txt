[39:08] stand turn to uh 1 John
[39:21] N verse
[39:25] four and these things write we unto you
[39:29] that your joy may be full this then is
[39:31] the message which we have heard of him
[39:33] and declare unto you that God is light
[39:35] and in him is no Darkness at all if we
[39:38] say that we have fellowship with him and
[39:40] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[39:42] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[39:45] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[39:47] with another in the blood of Jesus
[39:49] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[39:52] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[39:55] ourselves and the truth is not not in us
[39:57] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[39:59] and just to forgive us our sins and to
[40:02] cleanse us from all
[40:03] unrighteousness God bless his word you
[40:05] may be
[40:07] seties all right so this is part four in
[40:10] our journey to the uh life of Nehemiah
[40:15] even though we have not talked about
[40:16] Nehemiah yet this is the last stop
[40:19] before we hit Nehemiah okay it's going
[40:22] to make it all worthwhile
[40:24] promise so uh John has me up in two
[40:27] weeks time and I'm already studying the
[40:29] first one I'm excited I hope you'll be
[40:33] excited um realizing that Nehemiah is uh
[40:36] is becoming a treat to study even though
[40:38] that through our parts that
[40:42] um they were a bit more Hands-On back in
[40:44] the Old Testament than they are today um
[40:47] so there's going to be a couple things
[40:49] that he does that wouldn't necess
[40:51] necessarily recommend in a church but um
[40:54] God allowed it and God blessed it and it
[40:56] did did what had to do in for the
[40:57] children of Israel So today we're going
[40:59] to talk about Ezra so today is um is
[41:03] going to be a bit more of a not not a
[41:05] heavy one but the the subject matter is
[41:06] a bit more um bit more intense in terms
[41:09] of what Ezra had to do
[41:12] to kind of turn back the tide of what
[41:14] Satan was trying to do to the children
[41:16] of Israel so so as always we're going to
[41:19] do a bit of review we'll do it
[41:21] quickly so uh the last time we talked
[41:24] about zerubabel
[41:27] um and how he restored the temple so
[41:29] just so everyone's on the same page when
[41:31] David was king um he made Solomon the
[41:36] next king of Israel Solomon did well
[41:39] until he uh started marrying Pagan women
[41:43] and this is what started the process of
[41:46] judgment in the land of Israel and you
[41:49] see that cycle just completely
[41:51] obliterated uh the the land of Israel it
[41:54] just it never recovered until rubel came
[41:58] so because he married those Pagan women
[42:00] those Pagan women brought in Baal and
[42:02] the worship of Baal and what that
[42:04] brought into Israel was every matter of
[42:06] evil and uh every type of perversion and
[42:11] immorality that you can imagine till the
[42:13] it got to the point where you had a king
[42:16] in Judah who was sacrificing his own
[42:18] children and burning them with fire um
[42:22] hezekiah's father was the one who did
[42:24] that and then his son made it even worse
[42:27] to the point where he uh murdered the
[42:30] prophet Isaiah by putting him in a tree
[42:32] and sawing him in
[42:33] half so that idolatry was so was so
[42:39] prevalent in the two kingdoms that God
[42:42] had to do away with both of them
[42:43] obviously the Kingdom of Israel which
[42:45] was the 10 tribes was totally uh given
[42:48] over to Satan essentially and after only
[42:51] a brief few hundred years they get
[42:54] scattered to the winds and they never
[42:56] ever come back ever it was total
[43:00] Annihilation total judgment no Grace
[43:03] they were so given over whereas the land
[43:05] the the the line of Judah there was
[43:08] Grace for Judah why was there Grace for
[43:09] Judah because there was an unconditional
[43:12] Co Covenant called the David
[43:15] Covenant and that promise that was given
[43:17] to David was the only thing that held
[43:20] the line of Judah together and there was
[43:23] Grace for the children of David and the
[43:25] Kings so not all of them were good
[43:27] obviously most it was mainly hit and
[43:30] miss you had a couple good ones in
[43:32] Jehoshaphat you had Hezekiah you had
[43:33] joziah you had joash and a couple other
[43:37] ones and that held off that held off the
[43:40] Judgment that that was coming but
[43:42] because of the alliance of the the
[43:44] kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of
[43:45] Israel through the marriage of Ahab and
[43:49] Jezebel's uh daughter with David's great
[43:53] great great great grandson that
[43:55] conversion of of those two Bloodlines
[43:57] brought in the worship of Baal and that
[43:59] forever infected
[44:01] Judah so sin was in the camp and never
[44:04] got stamped out and it just snowballed
[44:06] and snowballed until
[44:08] finally God had to say enough is enough
[44:11] it's over by the time Jer Jeremiah
[44:14] comes the writing is on the wall
[44:17] judgment comes in the form of the
[44:18] Babylonians they come in three waves
[44:21] they
[44:22] completely strip Judah dry they get rid
[44:25] of all the the the Learned man and
[44:27] that's where we see David or Daniel and
[44:29] the three Hebrew children they were the
[44:31] cream of the crop and you see it that
[44:34] like uh Nebuchadnezzar wanted to take
[44:36] the best out of Israel first and they
[44:39] got rid of it and then they came back
[44:40] for the next best and they got rid of it
[44:42] and finally they were coming back for
[44:44] just the scraps Satan is the same way he
[44:47] doesn't want to leave anything behind he
[44:49] wants to steal crush and Destroy he's
[44:52] not content with the best he wants all
[44:54] of you but but thank thanks be to God we
[44:57] have a covenant amen we have Grace we
[44:59] have an atonement that is he can't cross
[45:01] that bloodline and that's that's the
[45:03] mercy that we have today so even though
[45:07] judgment came in the land the temple was
[45:09] burned all the treasure was taken away
[45:12] the Ark of the Covenant was lost forever
[45:14] there was a promise that after seven
[45:17] years that I will restore sayeth the
[45:20] Lord and Jeremiah says to to the people
[45:23] I know the thoughts towards you thoughts
[45:25] of peace to bring you to an expected end
[45:28] and this process now even though it was
[45:30] so desolate you
[45:32] had the conditions in Jerusalem were
[45:35] terrible you had a land burning you had
[45:38] corpses everywhere you had plague famine
[45:43] every matter of just
[45:45] awfulness present in Jerusalem there was
[45:48] still that promise of of Jeremiah saying
[45:49] to them I know the thoughts I have
[45:51] towards you thoughts of peace and even
[45:53] though it was at its darkest moment
[45:55] there was Grace
[45:56] coming because unfortunately there's a
[46:00] promise that whatsoever man Seth that
[46:03] shall he reap and they had to reap what
[46:04] they sowed but there was Grace
[46:07] coming so they get sent off into the
[46:10] land of Babylon they are there for 70
[46:13] years that's where we see Daniel is
[46:16] mainly ministering to the kings of
[46:17] Babylon and then Persia Cyrus the Great
[46:21] uh in the year 5 37
[46:24] declares
[46:26] not of his own accord this is a man
[46:30] completely controlled by prophecy here
[46:32] because he was named by name by Isaiah
[46:34] saying this is my shepherd and whom
[46:37] Israel will be delivered by Cyrus
[46:39] declares the people free he sends
[46:42] zerubabel down into uh Jerusalem and
[46:46] that's where they begin restoring the
[46:47] temple and we remember the the what
[46:50] happened there that the Samaritans came
[46:51] up against them they stopped the work of
[46:53] the temple and it looked like it was
[46:56] just totally done finished the work was
[46:59] completely over but that's where God
[47:01] sends in a a fire brand by the name of
[47:04] hegi and hegi is only on the scene for
[47:06] four very
[47:08] short candle burning on both ends period
[47:12] and he comes in guns blazing and
[47:14] essentially just spanks them from head
[47:17] to toe and says you are complacent you
[47:20] have let this get to you there's no
[47:22] reason for this to get to you you need
[47:24] to overcome this and get the job done
[47:26] they get it done he cleans them up and
[47:28] in four years time they build a
[47:31] temple and this is where we come into
[47:33] with Ezra
[47:36] so uh Ezra is the second so there
[47:40] there's three there's three waves of
[47:43] desolation in terms of what happens to
[47:48] Judah the cre of the crop gets turned
[47:51] away the second is Ezekiel and a number
[47:54] of other people are taken away and then
[47:56] finally the third is the temple and the
[47:59] city get totally burned and
[48:02] demolished in terms of the restoration
[48:05] again it's also three waves zerubba is
[48:08] the first but it starts with the temple
[48:10] first because the temple was the
[48:12] heartbeat of the whole Kingdom without
[48:14] the Temple Israel was nothing it had to
[48:17] be the temple first God restored worship
[48:20] first and only then would he start
[48:23] restoring everything else and Ezra Ezra
[48:26] was that second figure and Ezra comes
[48:30] about 11 years before Nehemiah comes and
[48:33] his his work was quite critical because
[48:36] he comes at a time where again Israel is
[48:38] on the precipice of going back to
[48:40] everything that they they were punished
[48:42] for okay so he gets the job done and
[48:45] then Nehemiah comes on but Ezra stays on
[48:48] and Ezra and Nehemiah are like
[48:50] essentially good cop and bad cop and
[48:54] Nehemiah is essentially the one who does
[48:56] all the dirty work doesn't care what he
[48:58] got to do to get the job done you know
[49:00] it took zerubabel four years to rebuild
[49:02] the Temple it takes Nehemiah 52 days to
[49:05] restore the walls of Jerusalem he was an
[49:07] absolute fire brand whereas Nehemiah
[49:09] Nehemiah after he does what he does here
[49:11] and we're going to talk about it today
[49:13] he then restores the law and he restores
[49:17] the the the the the feasts and and and
[49:20] the reading of the law to the people and
[49:23] then finally Nehemiah restores the wall
[49:25] s and the the protection of the city so
[49:30] so Ezra is a super critical figure and
[49:33] his name actually means God helps and
[49:37] then when Nehemiah comes his name mean
[49:40] God God Comforts so God sends two people
[49:44] that's going to going to be help and
[49:46] comfort to the people of
[49:50] Judah so after and what what's
[49:52] interesting is that you have uh Ezra and
[49:54] Nehemiah
[49:56] working and there's a brief period in
[49:58] the book book of Nehemiah where where
[49:59] Nehemiah goes back to Persia and during
[50:01] that time things slip
[50:04] again and God SS in Malachi during that
[50:08] brief Junction and he Nails all the same
[50:12] things that Ezra is nailing here today
[50:15] and then Nehemiah comes back and with
[50:17] the last
[50:18] chapter one of the craziest chapters
[50:21] that I think we'll read with with
[50:23] Nehemiah and he just sweeps the whole
[50:25] land in terms of everything that he
[50:28] saw so Ezra is a scribe he's a priest
[50:34] but most importantly he is a prophet and
[50:36] he's of the lineage of uh of the priests
[50:40] and he was a very sincere man he by
[50:43] being a scribe he knew the law by heart
[50:45] and he had to if he was going to be a
[50:47] scribe and uh so he was chosen by the
[50:52] king I think it was King
[50:54] haueris and
[50:57] he gets sent uh by um he gets sent with
[51:02] uh with the the the fewest amount of
[51:05] people out of all the the waves of
[51:07] people coming back zerel had had the
[51:08] most amount of people Ezra had the
[51:10] fewest amount so for whatever reason
[51:13] that restoration period was start
[51:15] starting to
[51:16] falter so let's turn to uh Ezra 7 you
[51:19] can either read along here or you can
[51:22] turn to your Bible it's probably better
[51:23] if follow along here so if you go to
[51:26] Ezra
[51:27] 7:6 this Ezra went up from Babylon and
[51:30] he was a ready scribe in the law of
[51:31] Moses which the Lord God of Israel had
[51:33] given and the King granted him all his
[51:35] request according to the hand of the
[51:37] Lord his God upon him and there went up
[51:40] some of the children of Israel and of
[51:42] the priests and of the Levites and the
[51:43] singers and the porters and the netham
[51:46] unto Jerusalem in the seventh year of AR
[51:48] arer I thought was Aeris I think Aeris
[51:51] is the king that um dealt with Esther I
[51:54] believe where that
[51:56] is has has thank
[52:00] you verse eight and he came to Jerusalem
[52:02] in the fifth month which was in the
[52:04] seventh year of the king for upon the
[52:06] first day of the first month began he to
[52:09] go up from Babylon and on the first day
[52:11] of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem
[52:14] according to the good hand of his God
[52:16] upon him for Ezra had prepared his heart
[52:18] to seek the law of the Lord and to do it
[52:21] and to teach in Israel statutes and
[52:23] judgments so his main man was to bring
[52:26] the word of God back to the people they
[52:28] had Temple worship which was great they
[52:30] had sacrifices which was great but they
[52:32] had to have the word okay the message
[52:35] for that time was the law and the
[52:38] prophets they couldn't just have the
[52:39] prophets they couldn't just had the law
[52:42] they had to have the law and the
[52:43] prophets okay and that really hasn't
[52:45] changed it it's still the word and and
[52:48] the prophets so there is uh a desire has
[52:53] been put in Ezra's heart to bring this
[52:55] to the people of Israel and when we get
[52:57] there we we we see why and and and
[53:01] what's interesting is that they have
[53:02] just restored the temple the temple has
[53:04] just been restored the sacrifice is
[53:06] there but they need the word okay and
[53:08] for any young person who gets filled
[53:10] with the Holy Ghost the soul is the
[53:12] Temple of the of of of the human once
[53:16] God fills the the soul of of an IND
[53:20] individual with a spirit the word has to
[53:23] be poured out upon that person has to be
[53:25] poured out like water upon a seed and it
[53:27] has to water it and let it grow and let
[53:30] it nourish and strengthen keep on
[53:32] pouring and pouring and pouring because
[53:37] a a young Christian is like a is like a
[53:40] fresh young sprig what does it need it
[53:43] needs the atmosphere of the sun and it
[53:45] needs water to grow and any person who
[53:49] gets filled with the Holy Ghost has to
[53:50] feed feed feed feed feed on the word
[53:54] nothing else nothing nothing else but
[53:55] the word otherwise it's going to get
[53:58] stunted and it's going to grow crooked
[54:00] its roots are not going to go down and
[54:02] eventually once the summer heat comes
[54:04] it's going to shrivel and dry out so
[54:08] that that word the the the the word of
[54:11] God in the heart of of a young person
[54:13] has to be poured on and poured on and
[54:15] poured on otherwise they're not going to
[54:17] survive the test once the test
[54:19] comes because there you notice God
[54:22] doesn't send the same tests to a young
[54:24] Christian like he does to a pastor
[54:27] there's a there's a season and a period
[54:29] of
[54:30] Grace and and what what what God is
[54:33] doing is he's allowing that little Eagle
[54:34] to learn how to fly to learn how H how
[54:37] to deal with with the challenges but the
[54:40] way that little Eagle got got got to
[54:43] grow is by feeding feeding from that
[54:46] mother
[54:47] Eagle all right so ultimately the there
[54:50] there's a there's a higher purpose for
[54:52] why Ezra is is being sent here because
[54:56] the the children of Israel had a higher
[54:59] standard required of them than all the
[55:02] other nations around them even the ones
[55:05] that were because remember Abraham is
[55:07] the father of Israel but Abraham is also
[55:09] the father of many nations so most of
[55:12] the Nations around them are actually
[55:13] related to them because you have Moab
[55:16] who is a descendant of Lot's daughter
[55:18] you have Ammon who's a descendant of the
[55:21] other uh daughter of lot so you have
[55:24] essentially cousins around them they
[55:26] have a form of worship you look at balum
[55:28] he was close he was very close almost
[55:32] identical but he didn't have the spirit
[55:34] he didn't have the law of Moses and the
[55:37] law of Moses for them was life it's not
[55:40] for us obviously but for them that was
[55:42] their message and God had a requirement
[55:45] that they had to be cleaner and more set
[55:47] aside and separate than any any other
[55:49] nations and what was the purpose behind
[55:52] that and we'll get into it so if you go
[55:54] to deuteron
[55:55] omy uh 14:2 for thou art a holy people
[55:59] unto the Lord thy God and the Lord hath
[56:01] chosen to be a peculiar people unto
[56:03] himself above all the nations that are
[56:05] upon the Earth and brother brandham says
[56:06] here in a blessing Prophet now Israel
[56:09] was a chosen elected selected people
[56:11] that God had chosen Israel for one
[56:13] specific purpose that the blood of
[56:15] Israel should be the cleanest
[56:17] bloodstream for out of that lineage was
[56:19] going to come the Messiah himself okay
[56:22] so that land had to be pure because out
[56:25] of that land was coming the Messiah
[56:26] which was not only Grace and Life to
[56:29] Israel but Grace to All Nations so
[56:32] Israel had to be set aside for that
[56:35] purpose so Ezra is uh he arrives in
[56:40] Jerusalem and there's just a brief
[56:42] period where he's essentially just
[56:44] getting his Affairs in
[56:46] order and the princes come to him and
[56:51] tell him about what's going on in the
[56:53] land and we read it here in verse one of
[56:57] chapter nine now when these things were
[56:58] done the princes came to me saying the
[57:01] people of Israel and the priests and the
[57:02] Levites have not separated themselves
[57:04] from the people of the lands doing
[57:06] according to their Abominations even of
[57:08] the Canaanites the Hittites the
[57:10] parasites the jebusites the ammonites
[57:12] the moabites the Egyptians and the
[57:14] amorites for they have taken of their
[57:16] daughters for themselves and for their
[57:17] sons so that the holy seed have mingled
[57:20] themselves with the people of those
[57:22] lands yay the hand of the prince and
[57:25] rulers hath been Chief in this
[57:28] trespass so what's interesting here is
[57:30] that they have done the exact same thing
[57:34] that their forefathers have done okay
[57:38] and it's just it's like a it's like a
[57:40] bad dream it just keeps on repeating
[57:42] itself over and over and over and they
[57:45] do it again I think twice over before
[57:48] everything is done and the reason for
[57:50] that is that the law of Moses covers the
[57:53] sin but it doesn't remove the desire for
[57:56] sin and you see that in them that they
[57:59] just can't help themselves they keep on
[58:00] going back to it but they knew better
[58:02] and they should have known better
[58:04] because the the desolation of Jerusalem
[58:07] was only should have been fresh in their
[58:10] minds but the desire for sin kept on
[58:13] pulling them back and what's interesting
[58:16] here is that the chief of the Sinners
[58:20] was the
[58:21] rulers the princes but not only that it
[58:24] was the Levites and the priests it was
[58:28] pervasive that sin was coming from the
[58:32] top and that's why you see when whenever
[58:35] um and that's why God requires more of
[58:37] leaders because if the leader does it
[58:39] it's a lot harder for the UN for the
[58:41] underling or the person underneath them
[58:43] to resist doing the same
[58:46] thing okay and that's why God requires
[58:49] more of the father than he does of the
[58:52] child because the child
[58:55] needs the help of the father in order to
[58:57] live right until that that child can
[59:00] reach
[59:01] maturity so you have here these the the
[59:06] the sin is starting from the top so then
[59:08] what happens is that everyone else just
[59:11] gets swept right under and you see that
[59:14] during times past in in the history of
[59:16] Israel that when the King was totally
[59:18] given over to that sin it's ranked
[59:22] throughout everyone else but when the
[59:23] King was righteous
[59:25] you there was a lot less chance of that
[59:27] of that sin being pervasive so it
[59:30] behooves us to to
[59:33] remember of you got to be you got to be
[59:36] mindful of those who are under you but
[59:38] also of those who are weaker than you
[59:41] because it's also that that whole
[59:43] principle in Romans 14 that you got to
[59:45] be careful what you do because if you if
[59:48] you uh a offend your brother but also
[59:51] cause him to do it by uh
[59:55] um through weakness then you're guilty
[59:58] for it because you may be able to handle
[1:00:00] it but not him so you got to be careful
[1:00:04] in terms of doing
[1:00:05] that all right moving on to Deuteronomy
[1:00:09] 7 so this is where we see the original
[1:00:12] commandment of Moses of what not to do
[1:00:14] and which they did verse one when the
[1:00:17] Lord thy God shall bring thee into the
[1:00:18] land whether thou goest to possess it
[1:00:20] and hath cast out many nations before
[1:00:22] Thee the Hittites and the girgashites
[1:00:24] and the amorites and the Canaanites and
[1:00:25] the perizzites and the hivites and the
[1:00:27] jebusites Seven Nations greater and
[1:00:29] mightier than thou and when the Lord thy
[1:00:31] God shall deliver them before thee Thou
[1:00:33] shalt Smite them down uh Thou shalt
[1:00:35] Smite them and utterly destroy them Thou
[1:00:37] shalt make no Covenant with them nor
[1:00:39] show Mercy unto them neither shalt thou
[1:00:41] make marriages with them thy daughter
[1:00:43] Thou shalt not give unto his son nor his
[1:00:45] daughter shalt thou take unto thy son
[1:00:47] for they would turn away thy son from
[1:00:48] following me that they may serve other
[1:00:50] gods so will the anger of the Lord be
[1:00:52] kindled against you and Destroy thee
[1:00:54] suddenly
[1:00:55] so the promise here is that if they did
[1:00:57] this judgment was coming
[1:00:59] immediately and you saw it there with
[1:01:01] the the first time that when they came
[1:01:04] out of Egypt when Moses goes up into
[1:01:06] Mount
[1:01:07] Si they after 40 days they start
[1:01:10] murmuring and complaining and they go to
[1:01:14] Aaron and say make us a god they make
[1:01:16] the God God sent she Taps Moses on the
[1:01:19] shoulder and says this the children have
[1:01:23] of Israel have commanded pedom with
[1:01:26] idolatry and you notice when when Moses
[1:01:28] goes down there he immed it's immediate
[1:01:31] judgment those who are with God come
[1:01:32] over here those who are not over there
[1:01:35] those who did not repent or swallowed
[1:01:36] them up
[1:01:38] immediately it it it was it was sudden
[1:01:41] it was drastic and that's how God dealt
[1:01:43] with that
[1:01:45] sin
[1:01:46] so Ezra knew that Israel here is in a
[1:01:49] precarious position if God does one
[1:01:51] thing in the exact same situation before
[1:01:54] he's obligated to do the same thing
[1:01:57] again he's he's a he is a god of Mercy
[1:02:00] but he's also a god of
[1:02:01] judgment okay and
[1:02:03] especially due to the fact that they
[1:02:05] knew better they had just been
[1:02:09] restored they just had the temple
[1:02:12] restored so this whole process is
[1:02:15] mindboggling that that sin set in the
[1:02:17] camp so quickly despite everything that
[1:02:19] just happened to
[1:02:21] them but the grace of the situation here
[1:02:24] is is that despite what Israel had done
[1:02:26] here despite what the priests had done
[1:02:28] the Levites the rulers the
[1:02:30] princes despite all that God had a man
[1:02:33] prepared in the background ready for the
[1:02:37] moment he was he was clean he was not
[1:02:40] touched by the sin and he was ready to
[1:02:43] be put in that moment and to be
[1:02:45] essentially to stand in the gap for the
[1:02:50] people so let's jump back to the Tom of
[1:02:53] balum because this is
[1:02:54] relevant and if we remember about the
[1:02:56] story of balum he was uh this is the
[1:02:59] time when Israel was was going from
[1:03:01] Egypt into Israel for the first time
[1:03:03] with Moses and the the moabites were
[1:03:06] afraid of the children of
[1:03:09] Israel because at the time Israel had
[1:03:12] defeated essentially the greatest nation
[1:03:13] of the time Egypt they had the greatest
[1:03:16] military the greatest Feats they had the
[1:03:17] greatest um architecture it it was by
[1:03:21] far the the richest Kingdom of the time
[1:03:23] and they brought Egypt to their knees to
[1:03:26] the point where Egypt gave them uh
[1:03:30] tribute in order to get them out of the
[1:03:32] land so all the other nations are
[1:03:34] terrified of them and Moab especially so
[1:03:37] balum who is a prophet of God he was a
[1:03:40] legit prophet of God God did speak to
[1:03:43] him he was hired by the king of of Moab
[1:03:46] to curse Israel so we all know know the
[1:03:50] story that bam tries he tries to go
[1:03:53] Angel stopped all that stuff
[1:03:54] so finally balum finds a
[1:03:57] way to get Israel and we see it here in
[1:04:01] numbers 25
[1:04:03] ver1 and Israel Abode in Shum and the
[1:04:06] people began to commit whoredom with the
[1:04:08] daughters of Moab and they called the
[1:04:10] people unto the sacrifices of their gods
[1:04:13] and the people did eat and bow down to
[1:04:14] their gods and Israel joined himself
[1:04:17] unto Bale
[1:04:18] pure and the anger of the Lord was King
[1:04:21] kindled against Israel and the Lord said
[1:04:23] unto Moses take all the heads of the
[1:04:25] people and hang them before the Lord
[1:04:27] against his son that the fierce anger of
[1:04:29] the Lord may be turned away from Israel
[1:04:31] and Moses said unto the judges of Israel
[1:04:33] slay everyone his men that were joined
[1:04:35] into Bale
[1:04:36] peor so we see here the idolatry happens
[1:04:40] Israel gets joined to Baal which is the
[1:04:42] first time ever that this ever happens
[1:04:44] but we see the difference here of what
[1:04:47] happens when when there's a man of God
[1:04:50] on the scene who cuts this thing
[1:04:52] off so Moses immediately
[1:04:56] says through God's commandment slay
[1:04:59] everyone who is worshiping Baal because
[1:05:02] we all because we we've we've now seen
[1:05:04] it what happened to the where it goes It
[1:05:07] goes to to child sacrifice burning
[1:05:10] children on the fire murdering prophets
[1:05:13] this that that is the end result but
[1:05:15] Moses sees the sees the
[1:05:18] seed
[1:05:20] Okay
[1:05:23] so
[1:05:26] God raises up a man here to take care of
[1:05:28] the situation and verse six and behold
[1:05:30] one of the children of Israel came and
[1:05:32] brought unto his Brethren a medidan
[1:05:34] itish woman in the sight of Moses in the
[1:05:36] sight of all the congregation of the
[1:05:37] children of Israel who were weeping
[1:05:39] before the door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:05:41] congregation and when Phineas the son of
[1:05:44] el Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
[1:05:46] saw it he rose up from among the
[1:05:48] congregation and took a javelin in his
[1:05:50] hand and he went after the man of Israel
[1:05:52] into the tent and thrust both of them
[1:05:54] through the man of Israel and the woman
[1:05:56] through her belly so the plague was
[1:05:58] stayed from the children of
[1:05:59] Israel
[1:06:02] okay
[1:06:04] so because of
[1:06:06] this this is what the Lord says unto
[1:06:11] Moses and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:06:13] saying Phineas the son of Eleazar the
[1:06:15] son of Aaron the priest hath turned away
[1:06:17] my wrath away from the children of
[1:06:19] Israel while he was zealous for my sake
[1:06:21] among them that I consumed them not the
[1:06:23] children of Israel in my jealousy
[1:06:25] wherefore say behold I give unto him my
[1:06:27] Covenant of peace and he shall have it
[1:06:29] and is seed after him even the Covenant
[1:06:32] of an everlasting priesthood because he
[1:06:34] was zealous for his God and made an
[1:06:36] atonement for the children of
[1:06:39] Israel so it seems extreme in terms of
[1:06:44] what phas did what Phineas
[1:06:47] did but God counted it onto him for for
[1:06:50] righteousness sake because he sees the
[1:06:52] sin of what's happening because he knows
[1:06:54] what Moses said over here don't do it
[1:06:58] don't do it because judgment is coming
[1:07:00] if this is tolerated so Phineas goes in
[1:07:03] and does the deed and what that does is
[1:07:05] that sin stops immediately it goes no
[1:07:10] further because everyone steps back and
[1:07:12] says
[1:07:13] whoa we're it gets everyone's attention
[1:07:16] and it stays and that's and that's how
[1:07:19] sin has to be dealt with it has to be
[1:07:21] dealt with firmly and quickly because
[1:07:24] you can't control sin sin is a fire it
[1:07:27] will consume everything if you allow it
[1:07:29] and that's why God was so pleased with
[1:07:31] what Finas did is because it put a giant
[1:07:34] period behind Baal Baal was stamped out
[1:07:37] before he had any chance to to have a
[1:07:40] tow hold because sin always starts with
[1:07:42] a toll hold no stronghold occurs without
[1:07:45] a toll hold and because Phineas never
[1:07:48] tolerated it God was so pleased with
[1:07:50] that man he said his entire family for
[1:07:53] all time time is going to be blessed
[1:07:55] because this one what one man did and
[1:07:58] there may be generational curses in the
[1:07:59] Bible but there are generational
[1:08:01] blessings in the Bible amen okay it's
[1:08:04] not all negative in terms of the a visit
[1:08:06] unto the fourth and fifth generation
[1:08:08] this man has been blessed for All Time
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:12] Eternity because he did one right
[1:08:16] thing and it behooves us that like when
[1:08:19] it comes to there are the not all days
[1:08:24] in in our lives are are equally as
[1:08:26] important there are times where God has
[1:08:28] prepared you for one specific moment and
[1:08:32] if you do that right thing you are
[1:08:35] blessed you know I you know not to put
[1:08:38] dad on a pedestal but I look at that one
[1:08:40] moment where Dad sees that ad and he
[1:08:44] looks back at it that was that moment
[1:08:46] that from there's three generations of
[1:08:48] Believers because of that turning back
[1:08:50] at that
[1:08:51] ad three generations there's there's a
[1:08:54] church because of that one ad there's
[1:08:56] there is there there is a light on this
[1:08:59] side of the island because of and
[1:09:01] there's Chad because of that
[1:09:05] ad especially Chad there'd be no clintar
[1:09:09] without
[1:09:13] dad you should thank him
[1:09:18] after but look at it
[1:09:22] atonement
[1:09:24] that one Javelin thrust was
[1:09:28] atonement because God knows that's where
[1:09:31] that's
[1:09:32] going you you don't see it now hard
[1:09:35] decisions may seem they may look extreme
[1:09:39] in terms of standing for what's right in
[1:09:41] your family in terms of what in terms of
[1:09:43] applying the token in your family it may
[1:09:45] seem extreme now but the Holy Ghost sees
[1:09:48] what's
[1:09:48] coming you don't see it but Faith sees
[1:09:51] the Unseen and it sees What could happen
[1:09:54] the wise man seeth the evil far off and
[1:09:56] hides himself the foolish man gets
[1:10:01] punished Faith sees what we don't
[1:10:05] see and you have to trust it you have to
[1:10:09] trust it brother B talks about and
[1:10:11] there's a quote later on that that I'll
[1:10:12] read that love Faith is nothing without
[1:10:15] love it starts with love love sets it up
[1:10:19] and Faith goes out in the battlefield
[1:10:22] but it starts from a foundation of love
[1:10:24] so anything that you make in terms of a
[1:10:26] decision for your family for yourself
[1:10:28] for the church your job whatever it may
[1:10:30] be it comes from a foundation of love
[1:10:32] and faith goes out on the battlefield
[1:10:34] for
[1:10:36] it and that's the heart thing about the
[1:10:38] word of God the word of God is the only
[1:10:41] is the only absolute when it comes to
[1:10:43] love in this world
[1:10:45] now love has been so
[1:10:49] diluted it's been so diluted and you see
[1:10:52] you see the effect of it now now where
[1:10:55] because out of love you have to accept
[1:10:57] every lifestyle you have to accept every
[1:11:00] every anything and everything everyone
[1:11:02] does and because of it you the the
[1:11:05] world's a total mess but by contrast you
[1:11:08] have the word of God and and God's love
[1:11:10] which will do things that seem hurtful
[1:11:13] at the
[1:11:16] moment but it's like the pruning the
[1:11:19] pruning seems hard but what it does is
[1:11:22] that it forces the root down so that the
[1:11:25] fruit goes
[1:11:26] up disciplining a child disciplining a
[1:11:29] child seems hard at the time but you're
[1:11:31] raising a good
[1:11:34] citizen it seems troubling to to a
[1:11:38] person who doesn't understand tough love
[1:11:40] but at the end of the day it's out of
[1:11:42] love for that person that you make a
[1:11:46] stand all
[1:11:48] right so back to Phineas God was so
[1:11:52] pleased with that because there was no
[1:11:55] hesitation he saw it and and and what
[1:11:57] was so Brazen what was so Brazen about
[1:12:00] this is that that man LED that woman
[1:12:03] right in front of
[1:12:06] Moses right in front of him and essenti
[1:12:09] she was CH it was a challenge it was a
[1:12:11] challenge to
[1:12:13] God are you going to do what you say
[1:12:15] you're going to do and Phineas
[1:12:17] immediately goes and does the deed
[1:12:19] there's no hesitation he sees the sin
[1:12:21] and he takes it out so God was so
[1:12:23] pleased with that but you see that God
[1:12:27] God God has blessed other men for these
[1:12:29] decisions you look at
[1:12:32] Abraham um and said by myself have I
[1:12:34] sworn sayith the Lord for because thou
[1:12:36] has done this thing and has not withheld
[1:12:38] thy son thine only son that in blessing
[1:12:40] I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I
[1:12:42] will multiply they seed as the stars of
[1:12:44] the heaven and as a sand which is upon
[1:12:46] the seashore and thy seede shall be get
[1:12:50] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[1:12:51] and in and in th seede shall all the
[1:12:53] nations of the earth be blessed because
[1:12:56] thou has obeyed my
[1:12:58] voice so you see that blessing is upon
[1:13:02] Abraham's seed not only to Isaac and
[1:13:05] Jacob and Joseph but for his seed
[1:13:07] forever and us we're included in that
[1:13:09] promise so we are blessed because of
[1:13:11] what Abraham has done and that's 4,000
[1:13:14] years of blessings that are perpetually
[1:13:16] rolling on because of what Abraham did
[1:13:20] and you see you look at Abraham he his
[1:13:22] characteristic is is what faith when
[1:13:25] anyone talks about faith it always goes
[1:13:26] back to Abraham but you see that
[1:13:28] characteristic trickle down to Isaac you
[1:13:31] look at Isaac and how he reacted when
[1:13:32] he's on that altar there's not a peep
[1:13:34] out of Isaac he takes it silently he
[1:13:37] trusts his father he has faith in his
[1:13:39] father that what whatever his father
[1:13:41] does is the right thing and that is for
[1:13:43] his own
[1:13:44] good and you look at Jacob he may have
[1:13:47] been a
[1:13:48] Sher but you look at the faith that he
[1:13:51] had when he he met up with that angel
[1:13:54] that man was not letting go of that of
[1:13:56] that supernatural being until he got
[1:13:59] what he wanted what is that other than
[1:14:02] Faith you look at Joseph everything that
[1:14:04] he went through all all of the
[1:14:08] the the uh the unfair things that
[1:14:12] happened to him through it all he's
[1:14:15] trusting God that there is a greater
[1:14:17] purpose for this that out of this life
[1:14:19] is going to come forth what is that
[1:14:22] other than faith
[1:14:24] and then there's there's David where um
[1:14:27] I'll probably just skip reading this but
[1:14:28] it talks about how because of what David
[1:14:32] did he was the he was the man after
[1:14:33] God's Own Heart and he's saying here I
[1:14:36] will establish Solomon thy son and his
[1:14:38] seed forever and he did because you look
[1:14:41] the be despite what Solomon did there
[1:14:44] was still Grace to to Sal to David and
[1:14:46] Solomon seed because where did It
[1:14:48] ultimately end up the ultimate King of
[1:14:50] Kings Christ he was the seed of David
[1:14:53] and that continues on further because we
[1:14:55] are of Christ
[1:14:58] so and again you look at the the
[1:15:00] characteristics of David what in my view
[1:15:04] David's greatest characteristics were
[1:15:05] were two things one his
[1:15:08] worship secondly his his his his his
[1:15:13] first instinct was always run to the
[1:15:16] temple and pray whenever he was in
[1:15:18] trouble run to the prophet and pray the
[1:15:22] mberry bush it was always prayer prayer
[1:15:24] prayer prayer prayer prayer and you look
[1:15:26] through his descendants you look at
[1:15:28] Solomon it was the same thing he was
[1:15:30] always going to God In Prayer he did
[1:15:32] mess up afterward but he started well
[1:15:35] you look at Hezekiah Hezekiah has one of
[1:15:38] the greatest prayers in the Bible
[1:15:40] because when he was in trouble he ran to
[1:15:41] the Lord and his descendants Josiah was
[1:15:44] the same way joash was the same way
[1:15:45] these Kings the the the the the blood of
[1:15:48] David was running through them and they
[1:15:49] had that same characteristic of always
[1:15:51] running to the Lord they were always
[1:15:52] running whereas you look at the kingdoms
[1:15:54] of of the north of the
[1:15:55] Israel total total
[1:15:59] heathens so finally with with with
[1:16:01] Phineas we read here in
[1:16:03] Psalms where he kind of recounts
[1:16:05] everything that happens to him then
[1:16:07] stood up Phineas and executed judgment
[1:16:09] and so the plague was stayed and that
[1:16:10] was counted onto him for righteousness
[1:16:12] unto all generations forever more and I
[1:16:15] said all that to say
[1:16:16] this now after these things in the reign
[1:16:19] of AR exes king of pers Ezra the son of
[1:16:21] sah the son of azra the son of hilaya
[1:16:24] the son of shalam the son of zadok the
[1:16:26] son of Hub the son of amariah the son of
[1:16:29] Azariah the son of Maro the son of
[1:16:31] Zariah the son of uzzi the son of bukai
[1:16:34] the son of abashi the son of
[1:16:38] vas who is Ezra the descendant of
[1:16:43] Phineas the son of elar the son of Baron
[1:16:46] the chief
[1:16:48] priest
[1:16:50] so in re so in going through through all
[1:16:53] that what was the situation that Israel
[1:16:55] faced you had a situation where Israel
[1:16:58] was marrying into the Pagan women okay
[1:17:03] who were all the other nations they were
[1:17:05] worshippers of
[1:17:07] Baal and it got to the point where they
[1:17:09] even had children with these women it
[1:17:12] was
[1:17:17] rooted so the descendant of Phineas who
[1:17:21] dealt with the exact same thing
[1:17:24] men who were joining themselves to
[1:17:26] Heathen women who were worshiping Baal
[1:17:28] the same descendant of Phineas was
[1:17:31] facing the exact same problem but
[1:17:32] multiplied by a 100 because he you now
[1:17:35] have kids rooted in the
[1:17:39] family so God has given the the same
[1:17:43] characteristics that Phineas has you see
[1:17:46] it in Israel so you see this man who is
[1:17:50] a scribe he's been Sanctified he's been
[1:17:52] set aside for service he has the
[1:17:54] blessing of Phineas upon
[1:17:57] him and you see him in the exact same
[1:18:00] situation multiplied by
[1:18:04] 100 we'll see what he
[1:18:07] does Ezra n and when I heard this thing
[1:18:10] I rent my garment and my mantle and
[1:18:12] plucked off the hair of my head and of
[1:18:14] my beard and sat down astonished then
[1:18:17] were assembled unto me everyone that
[1:18:19] trembled at the words of the god of
[1:18:20] Israel because of the transgression of
[1:18:22] the that have been carried away and I
[1:18:24] sat astonished until the evening
[1:18:27] sacrifice at the evening sacrifice I
[1:18:29] arose up from my heaviness and having
[1:18:30] rent my garment and my mentle I fell
[1:18:33] upon my knees and spread out my hands
[1:18:35] unto the Lord my
[1:18:38] God so what's interesting is that the uh
[1:18:40] the the message of the blushing the
[1:18:42] blushing Prophet is about Ezra and it
[1:18:45] talks about
[1:18:47] how how the sins of the people weighed
[1:18:49] so heavily upon Ezra that
[1:18:53] he had no choice but to react like he's
[1:18:57] reacting here because again as a scribe
[1:19:01] he knows the history he knows what they
[1:19:03] had just gone through and he knows where
[1:19:06] this could go if this doesn't get
[1:19:08] settled and he also knows what the
[1:19:11] solution always had to be this is not a
[1:19:14] light situation this is a very heavy
[1:19:17] situation and it's now falling on him to
[1:19:21] do
[1:19:26] we see here in desperations if you made
[1:19:27] a mistake some woman made a mistake some
[1:19:29] man made a mistake some boy or girl made
[1:19:31] a mistake don't sink scream out in in
[1:19:34] despair Lord save me or I'll perish get
[1:19:37] desperate about it God will hear you he
[1:19:39] always hears a desperate Soul that's
[1:19:42] what I'm trying to tell you
[1:19:43] about so you see here Ezra Ezra is
[1:19:47] baptized in a
[1:19:49] baptism of
[1:19:51] anguish and you see here a man in
[1:19:55] travail and and and and you see he's
[1:19:57] literally plucking out his
[1:19:59] beard he he's that overcome with grief
[1:20:02] over the sins of the people he's so
[1:20:04] ashamed because it's like how could this
[1:20:06] happen so quickly we just went through
[1:20:08] this we've been given a small window of
[1:20:11] Grace and this is what we do we spit in
[1:20:13] your
[1:20:14] face so he understands it's a junction
[1:20:18] of time mercy and grace are right here
[1:20:21] in front of him or mer mer and judgment
[1:20:23] are right here before
[1:20:25] him and he knows what he has to
[1:20:31] do so he says here in verse six and said
[1:20:34] oh my God I am ashamed and blushed to
[1:20:37] lift up my face to thee my God for our
[1:20:39] iniquities are increased over our head
[1:20:41] and our trespasses grown up unto the
[1:20:43] heavens since the days of our fathers
[1:20:45] have we been in great trespass unto this
[1:20:47] day and for our iniquities have we our
[1:20:49] Kings and our priests have been
[1:20:51] delivered into the hand of the king of
[1:20:53] the lands to the sword to captivity and
[1:20:55] to a spoil and to confusion of face as
[1:20:58] it is this day and now for a little
[1:21:00] space Grace ha been showed from the Lord
[1:21:03] Our God to leave us a Remnant to escape
[1:21:06] and to give us a nail in his holy place
[1:21:09] that our God May lighten our eyes and
[1:21:10] give us a little Reviving in our
[1:21:16] bondage for we were bomman yet Our God
[1:21:19] hath not forsaken us in our bondage but
[1:21:21] hath extended Mercy on to us in the
[1:21:23] sight of the kings of Persia to give us
[1:21:25] a Reviving to set up the house of our
[1:21:27] God and to repair the desolations
[1:21:29] thereof and to give us a wall in Judah
[1:21:31] and Jerusalem and now our god what shall
[1:21:33] we say after this for we have forsaken
[1:21:35] thy Commandments which thou has
[1:21:37] commanded by thy servants the prophets
[1:21:39] saying the land unto which you go to
[1:21:40] possess it is an unclean land with the
[1:21:43] filthiness of the people of the lands
[1:21:44] with their Abominations which have
[1:21:46] filled it from one end to another with
[1:21:47] their
[1:21:48] uncleanness now therefore give Not Your
[1:21:50] Daughters unto their sons neither take
[1:21:52] their daughters unto your sons nor seek
[1:21:54] their peace or their wealth forever that
[1:21:56] you may be strong in eat the good of the
[1:21:58] land and leave it for an inheritance to
[1:22:00] your children forever and after all that
[1:22:02] is come upon us for our evil deeds and
[1:22:04] for our great trespass seeing that thou
[1:22:06] Our God has punished us less than our
[1:22:09] iniquities deserve and that's true and
[1:22:11] has given us such Deliverance as this
[1:22:13] should we again break thy Commandments
[1:22:15] and join in Affinity with the people of
[1:22:17] these Abominations wouldest not thou be
[1:22:20] angry with us till thou H has consumed
[1:22:22] us
[1:22:23] so that there should be no Remnant nor
[1:22:24] escaping or oh Lord God of Israel Thou
[1:22:28] Art righteous for we remain yet escaped
[1:22:31] as it is this day behold we are before
[1:22:33] thee in our trespasses for we cannot
[1:22:35] stand before thee because of
[1:22:38] this so we see here the weight of of the
[1:22:41] situation on ezrael he's saying we
[1:22:45] gotten less than we deserve and we've
[1:22:46] had a small window of Grace here please
[1:22:50] forgive
[1:22:51] us
[1:22:53] brother Bram says in a blessing Prophet
[1:22:55] somebody has got to speak the thing
[1:22:57] somebody has got to place it before the
[1:22:59] people perhaps Ezra didn't want to do it
[1:23:02] but it was in his heart and when you see
[1:23:04] a servant of God get so sincere till
[1:23:05] he's on his face with his hands in the
[1:23:07] air a praying to God and blushing
[1:23:09] because the iniquity of the people then
[1:23:11] you're going to see a Revival start a
[1:23:13] man cannot lay in the presence of God a
[1:23:16] church cannot stay in the presence of
[1:23:17] God under repentance unless the Holy
[1:23:18] Spirit comes down and gives unction and
[1:23:20] power to start a move of God in there
[1:23:22] amongst those PE amongst those people
[1:23:25] just got to
[1:23:26] be and you see here that Ezra is in such
[1:23:31] travail he's mourning in front of the
[1:23:33] people and he gets the attention of the
[1:23:34] people and see all around him because
[1:23:37] he's groaning in the spirit he's
[1:23:39] laboring in the presence of God that
[1:23:41] everyone around him starts to come under
[1:23:43] that same anointing and everyone starts
[1:23:45] mourning and weeping and
[1:23:48] repenting because all all God requires
[1:23:51] is one
[1:23:53] one person one person prayed up and
[1:23:56] desperate a broken and a contrite spirit
[1:24:00] he won't
[1:24:01] despise so when it comes to a situation
[1:24:04] when it get when it seems like it gets
[1:24:06] to its darkest and at its worst God send
[1:24:08] someone who's prayed
[1:24:10] up and that and that and that the the
[1:24:13] weight the weight of that situation
[1:24:15] comes on that man and he pulls all of
[1:24:18] Heaven
[1:24:19] down he's literally pulling the solution
[1:24:22] down
[1:24:23] because God now has a conduit to work
[1:24:25] through God God needs a vessel he needs
[1:24:27] a man to work through in a situation so
[1:24:31] as long as he has one person one person
[1:24:33] who's given over to him whose heart is
[1:24:36] tender towards him he can work through
[1:24:39] that
[1:24:40] person despite how hard everyone is
[1:24:43] around them because if they seed God can
[1:24:46] melt any any hard heart in a moment
[1:24:50] we've seen it and in terms of you need
[1:24:53] one power of God come down and it
[1:24:56] crumbles all the walls it crumbles the
[1:24:58] walls of of division it crumbles the
[1:25:01] walls of of complexes of issues of
[1:25:03] diseases in a
[1:25:05] moment I'll never forget that that um
[1:25:08] those first special meetings with
[1:25:09] brother Ben NORAD the walls were
[1:25:11] breathing from the presence of
[1:25:14] God because what happened there was
[1:25:16] people who went and start laboring in
[1:25:18] prayer before it happened they
[1:25:21] were
[1:25:24] God gives the
[1:25:25] unction God gives the desire first he
[1:25:28] sends his holy spirit out first and
[1:25:31] those people start praying and God comes
[1:25:33] down so when when God starts sending his
[1:25:36] holy spirit out what he's saying he's
[1:25:38] declaring war on this situation he's
[1:25:40] saying the time has come for deliverance
[1:25:43] the time of restoration is upon us and
[1:25:46] there's nothing there's nothing that can
[1:25:48] get away from it there's nothing that
[1:25:50] can that that can even push it back cuz
[1:25:53] when God starts rolling it's like Psalm
[1:25:55] uh Psalm 18 he comes down on a cloud a
[1:25:58] thunder cloud upon a chariot and he just
[1:26:01] he cast everything down and there's
[1:26:03] nothing that can stand up against it
[1:26:06] because when God says the time of
[1:26:09] freedom is upon
[1:26:12] us it's upon
[1:26:19] us now when Ezra had prayed and when he
[1:26:22] had confessed weeping and casting
[1:26:24] himself down before the house of God
[1:26:26] there assembled unto him out of Israel a
[1:26:28] very great Congregation of men and women
[1:26:30] and children for the people wept very
[1:26:33] sore so we're now starting to see the
[1:26:35] effect of this revival now
[1:26:38] starting
[1:26:40] okay we see here again in blessing
[1:26:43] Prophet somebody has got to speak the
[1:26:44] thing I think this may be a duplicate
[1:26:47] yes it
[1:26:48] is usually it takes a state of emergency
[1:26:51] to throw us into desperation
[1:26:53] see it's too bad it has to do that but
[1:26:55] human beings are so slothful in their
[1:26:56] mind that it takes an emergency
[1:26:58] something arises and when they do it
[1:27:00] throws them into that desperation and
[1:27:02] really in doing that in desperation it
[1:27:04] brings out the real thing that you are
[1:27:06] it shows What You're Made Of out in the
[1:27:08] time of desperation it usually pulls out
[1:27:11] all the good things that's in you
[1:27:14] because the problem
[1:27:15] is is that Satan is a master of
[1:27:21] complacency he is a master at lulling
[1:27:24] you to
[1:27:25] sleep Satan doesn't want you to he he's
[1:27:28] smart because when he's dealing with
[1:27:30] Believers he doesn't hit you with fullon
[1:27:32] sin what he does he
[1:27:34] starts making you busy and then he
[1:27:38] starts getting you on the
[1:27:40] phone and you're just scrolling all the
[1:27:43] time and then suddenly you're not
[1:27:45] reading your Bible as much suddenly
[1:27:47] you're not praying as much as he should
[1:27:49] be suddenly church becomes a secondary
[1:27:53] um a secondary thing and then soon once
[1:27:57] you're in a position of weakness then he
[1:27:59] can start injecting stuff and again it
[1:28:01] starts
[1:28:02] small he's a master at just little bits
[1:28:05] at a time and
[1:28:08] eventually it keeps on going and it
[1:28:10] keeps on going and it keeps on going and
[1:28:13] what God does Charles Spurgeon has a
[1:28:15] great great quote he says I've learned
[1:28:17] to kiss the wave that crashes Me Against
[1:28:19] the Rock of Ages because what it does in
[1:28:22] those moments is that God is saying wake
[1:28:25] up wake up you're in a super you need to
[1:28:28] wake up and those are the greatest
[1:28:30] moments of Grace in your life because
[1:28:32] God is saying okay you need to stop this
[1:28:35] has gone long enough you have a purpose
[1:28:38] and you need to get back on track and it
[1:28:41] happens to all of us because of you look
[1:28:43] in that quote we're slothful we're
[1:28:45] slothful in our minds the body is or the
[1:28:48] spirit is willing but the body is
[1:28:50] weak okay
[1:28:53] and you get and you look at what
[1:28:54] happened to the children of Israel they
[1:28:56] didn't get married to these women and
[1:28:57] have kids with them immediately it
[1:28:59] started with a second
[1:29:01] look and then it turned to a third look
[1:29:04] and then it started with a conversation
[1:29:06] and then it started from there maybe the
[1:29:10] maybe she allowed him to still worship
[1:29:12] Jehovah but she said can I just worship
[1:29:14] my God in the privacy of my home and
[1:29:16] eventually he's worshiping Baal and
[1:29:18] eventually the kids know nothing about
[1:29:20] Jehovah and are only worshiping B
[1:29:23] and that's where it
[1:29:24] goes and that's why God has to shock you
[1:29:27] sometimes to put you in a in a place of
[1:29:30] desperation for you to wake up for you
[1:29:33] to snap out of your stuper and get back
[1:29:36] on track and in those moments is when
[1:29:39] you got to apply the token because you
[1:29:40] got to clear out all the things that got
[1:29:42] you there in the first
[1:29:44] place and applying the Tok is not just
[1:29:46] things it's not just the TV it's also
[1:29:50] what you read it's also what you the
[1:29:54] relationships you have but it's also
[1:29:56] what you think about what you think
[1:29:58] about in your heart all those thing you
[1:30:01] got to apply the token to the whole
[1:30:04] thing not just certain areas it's not
[1:30:06] just the TV or you know these
[1:30:09] days just the phone it's not just the
[1:30:13] phone so it's one of those things where
[1:30:15] it's just that's where calling your uh
[1:30:18] making your calling election sure that's
[1:30:21] what that is it's just be
[1:30:23] attentive don't get into a stuper and
[1:30:27] make sure that you're checking up with
[1:30:28] God daily that's making your calling
[1:30:30] election short just making sure that you
[1:30:32] are where you where you're meant to be
[1:30:34] and the only way you can do that is
[1:30:36] daily daily prayer there's no excuse
[1:30:38] without doing it you know we all
[1:30:41] struggle with it but you got to do it
[1:30:43] you got to go to church and you got to
[1:30:44] do communion communion is so important
[1:30:46] communion is The Ultimate Showdown
[1:30:48] because that's where if you do it in the
[1:30:50] right way and you're where you need to
[1:30:51] be it's a blessing if you're not if
[1:30:52] you're doing as a hypocrite it's a
[1:30:54] curse so that's why God has communion
[1:30:56] there it's because it's the ultimate
[1:30:58] like you got to watch how you're living
[1:31:00] it's the
[1:31:03] ultimate okay so everyone's weeping
[1:31:07] because of what's happening with
[1:31:08] Ezra so this person sheni the son of jel
[1:31:13] one of the sons of elim answered and
[1:31:15] said on it unto Ezra we have trespassed
[1:31:17] against our God and have taken strange
[1:31:19] wives of the people of the land yet now
[1:31:22] there is hope in Israel concerning this
[1:31:23] thing now therefore let us make a
[1:31:25] covenant with our God to put away all
[1:31:27] the wives and such as are born of them
[1:31:30] according to the counsel of my Lord and
[1:31:33] of those that tremble at the Commandment
[1:31:34] of our God let it be done according to
[1:31:36] the law arise for this matter belongeth
[1:31:38] unto thee we also will be with thee be
[1:31:41] of good courage and do it and then arose
[1:31:43] Ezra and made the chief priests and the
[1:31:45] Levites and all Israel to swear that
[1:31:47] they should do according to his to this
[1:31:48] word and they
[1:31:50] swear so
[1:31:52] they're in a situation where they they
[1:31:54] they've played around with sin and it's
[1:31:57] it's gone along for too long so this
[1:31:59] person this man comes up and says this
[1:32:02] is what we have to do said we have put
[1:32:05] ourselves in this position and we have
[1:32:07] to divorce our Pagan wives and send them
[1:32:11] and the children that we have had with
[1:32:13] them
[1:32:19] away it's tough
[1:32:24] but they broke God's
[1:32:26] word it's either that or
[1:32:30] judgment so what they do is that they
[1:32:33] apply the token and they cast it
[1:32:40] out you know that's what happens when we
[1:32:43] tolerate sin if we play around with it
[1:32:45] if we let
[1:32:46] it settle in our lives and let it linger
[1:32:50] and let it just simmer
[1:32:53] it's easy to get rid of it when it first
[1:32:55] comes in the longer you let it take root
[1:32:59] the more severe the solution has to be
[1:33:02] this is Extreme you know obviously this
[1:33:05] is not you know we're not typing this
[1:33:07] naturally this is spiritually applying
[1:33:10] the token is easy when you do it at the
[1:33:12] beginning if you let it linger it's
[1:33:17] hard
[1:33:20] okay
[1:33:22] so next
[1:33:26] up then Israel rose up from before the
[1:33:29] house of God and went to the Chamber of
[1:33:30] jeen the son of
[1:33:32] aelish and when he came thither he did
[1:33:35] eat no bread nor drink water for he
[1:33:36] mourned because of the transgression of
[1:33:38] them that have been carried away and
[1:33:40] they made Proclamation throughout Judah
[1:33:42] and Jerusalem unto the children of the
[1:33:43] Captivity that they should gather
[1:33:45] themselves together unto Jerusalem and
[1:33:47] that whosoever will not come within 3
[1:33:49] days according to the Council of the
[1:33:50] princes in the ERS all his substance
[1:33:53] should be forfeited and himself
[1:33:54] separated from the congregation of those
[1:33:56] that have been carried away then all the
[1:33:58] men of Judah and Benjamin gathered
[1:34:00] themselves together unto Jerusalem
[1:34:01] within 3 days it was the n9th month on
[1:34:04] the 20th day of the month and all the
[1:34:05] people sat in the street of the house of
[1:34:07] God trembling because of this matter and
[1:34:09] for the great
[1:34:11] Reign so not only did they have to do
[1:34:14] this thing but every person in Israel
[1:34:17] had to do it if they didn't do it all
[1:34:19] their substance would be
[1:34:22] torn away from him and he would be
[1:34:23] separated forever from being allowed to
[1:34:26] dwell amongst the
[1:34:28] Jews there was no choice here for the
[1:34:32] sake and the health of the
[1:34:34] Kingdom they had to do it if they didn't
[1:34:36] do it they're
[1:34:39] gone and at this point everyone is
[1:34:43] somber they're serious and they realize
[1:34:45] the importance of it because they're
[1:34:46] literally trembling because of this
[1:34:49] matter so it all ends up with the men
[1:34:53] going through and ahead with it they
[1:34:56] divorce their wives they get rid of the
[1:34:58] kids along with the
[1:35:00] wives and judgment is
[1:35:03] stayed
[1:35:05] okay and Ezra his purpose at this point
[1:35:08] is done and we see him when when we go
[1:35:10] into Nehemiah that his his his role
[1:35:12] turns into establishing the law reading
[1:35:15] out the law establishing the feast and
[1:35:16] all that
[1:35:17] stuff so obviously the the the Les for
[1:35:21] us here this is an extreme case
[1:35:25] but God is requiring his people to be
[1:35:28] clean and set aside for
[1:35:30] service it may not be sins like this
[1:35:34] but are you allowing your life to get
[1:35:37] soft are you allowing your life to get
[1:35:39] complacent are you allowing Satan to
[1:35:43] dull your senses because all satan wants
[1:35:45] to do is take the fight out of
[1:35:47] you okay he just want what what what
[1:35:50] what's the problem with his age this age
[1:35:52] is
[1:35:53] lukewarm he either wants you cold or
[1:35:56] other want he wants you hot but the
[1:35:59] worst is
[1:36:01] lukewarm and that's what Satan is trying
[1:36:03] to do with us today is try to make you
[1:36:06] lukewarm try to get you complacent try
[1:36:09] to get you to the point where you don't
[1:36:11] really care where church has just become
[1:36:14] a routine where your Christian walk has
[1:36:16] just been routine you're no longer
[1:36:19] you're no longer
[1:36:23] on fire for God as as you ought to and
[1:36:25] really what it is is you've lost your
[1:36:27] first
[1:36:30] love and what God is wanting is to shake
[1:36:34] you and you got to learn to listen to
[1:36:37] listen to those shakings when he's
[1:36:39] trying to get your attention he's
[1:36:40] wanting to get get you back into a path
[1:36:43] where you're
[1:36:45] laboring because he wants to use you he
[1:36:48] can he can only work through a human he
[1:36:50] can only work through a a man or a
[1:36:57] woman so he needs
[1:37:00] you and if you're not where you need to
[1:37:03] be in terms of your
[1:37:05] life then the blessings are not flowing
[1:37:08] as they
[1:37:09] should your family is not going to be
[1:37:11] thriving as they should and then
[1:37:14] therefore by trickle effect the church
[1:37:16] is not going to be doing well as it
[1:37:18] should because a strong family comes
[1:37:21] from a strong father and a strong mother
[1:37:25] a strong church is a collection of
[1:37:27] strong
[1:37:28] families so if you're wondering why
[1:37:30] what's going on with the church take a
[1:37:33] step back and look at your family and if
[1:37:35] there's something on the go with your
[1:37:36] family take a step back further get a
[1:37:39] mirror up and look at
[1:37:41] yourself a problem in the church starts
[1:37:44] with
[1:37:45] you and God had mercy upon us because
[1:37:47] it's so easy to look at the other person
[1:37:49] and say man if they only would just
[1:37:52] you know only brother Bob would do
[1:37:53] better songs we' have better song
[1:37:55] Services you do great
[1:37:58] songs um it always starts with you it
[1:38:03] the moving of God is not it it's not
[1:38:05] like Israel where it's a to it's a total
[1:38:07] Nation affair they had no choice to do
[1:38:09] it but when it comes to us it's an
[1:38:11] individual Affair so God puts all
[1:38:14] responsibility upon you if you take care
[1:38:16] of your end he takes care of the rest if
[1:38:19] you are where you need to be spirit
[1:38:21] the church will follow because you look
[1:38:24] at Ezra because he was strong
[1:38:25] spiritually the rest of them
[1:38:28] followed so you can't be critical when
[1:38:31] you're when you get to a point where
[1:38:32] where you're being critical is because
[1:38:34] you're getting
[1:38:35] lukewarm because when you're lukewarm
[1:38:38] you're looking at everything but
[1:38:40] yourself because you've become
[1:38:43] complacent and when you get lukewarm
[1:38:46] then you're not you're you're not
[1:38:48] praying as you ought to you're not
[1:38:49] reading as you ought to you're not
[1:38:51] you're not that connection between you
[1:38:53] and God is is is has become
[1:38:57] clouded so what God is want so then God
[1:39:00] what God what God has no choice to do is
[1:39:02] to send situations at you that that will
[1:39:04] grab your attention snap you out of your
[1:39:06] out of your funk and if you don't listen
[1:39:09] they gradually get worse and worse and
[1:39:12] worse and
[1:39:15] worse so we have to we have to be to to
[1:39:19] be to be spiritual minded to recognize
[1:39:22] when when when God's trying to get your
[1:39:25] attention because the other thing the
[1:39:28] other thing is that this age what was
[1:39:30] this age commandment in Revelation be
[1:39:32] zealous therefore and repent and you see
[1:39:35] here with
[1:39:37] Ezra he was being zealous therefore and
[1:39:39] and he put himself in there he wasn't
[1:39:42] saying the the princes and the Levites
[1:39:45] are the ones at fault judge them but
[1:39:48] I've been good no he put himself in
[1:39:50] there
[1:39:51] so if you want the church to do well you
[1:39:54] put yourself in there God I have not I'm
[1:39:56] not where I need to be and if you want
[1:39:58] if you're wanting the church to
[1:40:00] go if you think the church is not where
[1:40:02] it ought to be look at yourself
[1:40:06] first responsibility is hard this age is
[1:40:10] an age of selfishness and of
[1:40:13] self-love and no one there's no such
[1:40:16] thing as putting in the work anymore
[1:40:17] everyone wants to be
[1:40:19] given everyone wants to fast
[1:40:22] with no
[1:40:24] friction but that's not God's
[1:40:27] way at the end of the day we're supposed
[1:40:29] to have character and character only
[1:40:31] comes really from
[1:40:32] suffering from working at it laboring
[1:40:37] brother Ram talks about you know car
[1:40:39] developing characters not God you know
[1:40:41] pulling through a pipe and saying you
[1:40:44] overcame what is overcoming it's that
[1:40:47] little it's that little chick in the
[1:40:49] egg Peck his way
[1:40:53] out and it does it over and over and
[1:40:55] over and over and over and over and once
[1:40:58] it starts to to break out he's not done
[1:41:01] yet he got to keep on going he got to
[1:41:03] keep on
[1:41:05] going
[1:41:07] so at the end of the
[1:41:10] day we can't be ignorant of Satan's
[1:41:13] devices of how he gets us to a place we
[1:41:15] where we are
[1:41:16] lukewarm he always starts small he
[1:41:19] always starts in places that we don't
[1:41:20] expect it and more often than not like
[1:41:24] it's your
[1:41:25] phone it's it's the it's the getting
[1:41:28] caught up in business of the world it's
[1:41:30] getting caught up in business of work
[1:41:31] it's getting caught up with all these
[1:41:33] different
[1:41:34] things it's not simple things but it's
[1:41:36] things that that distract
[1:41:38] you okay it's it and eventually if if
[1:41:43] you if if your spirit gets
[1:41:45] clouded then he's feeding you he's
[1:41:48] feeding your thoughts then then he's
[1:41:50] planning things in your mind complexes
[1:41:52] distractions all these things and what
[1:41:54] God is is requiring of his
[1:41:57] people is
[1:41:59] to clear all the flu you you look at
[1:42:02] what brother Braham says in the greatest
[1:42:04] battle of ever fought you got to clean
[1:42:05] out all those channels clean out the
[1:42:07] imagination clean out the conscience
[1:42:09] clean out the affection clean out the
[1:42:11] the reasoning clean out the memories
[1:42:14] clear it all out and move forward forget
[1:42:17] forget all the hurts forget in terms of
[1:42:20] remember forget all the heurs forget all
[1:42:21] the things that you did wrong move
[1:42:23] forward put all under the blood apply
[1:42:25] the token to your home and move
[1:42:28] forward because at the end of the day
[1:42:30] God wants his people to be honest with
[1:42:33] him be honest with him recognize when
[1:42:37] you need help recognize when when you
[1:42:39] when you need him to to take over
[1:42:43] because more often than not we get he he
[1:42:45] he steps back and waits until you admit
[1:42:47] that you can't do it
[1:42:48] yourself no matter what it is
[1:42:52] because if you read in job he he he says
[1:42:55] uh job says there's nothing
[1:42:56] insignificant under in the sight of the
[1:42:58] Lord meaning that in in every problem
[1:43:01] that you deal with it's you can bring
[1:43:04] every single one of them to the Lord and
[1:43:05] He will answer you might he may not
[1:43:07] answer right away he may not answer the
[1:43:09] way you want him to but he will
[1:43:12] answer and what God is trying to develop
[1:43:15] in his people especially in this age is
[1:43:19] trust and the hardest thing to do for a
[1:43:22] Believer is to walk completely by faith
[1:43:25] to not rely on the arm of Flesh and
[1:43:29] Trust the unseeing eye because more
[1:43:33] often than not we see a situation and we
[1:43:34] want to take over because fear sets in
[1:43:38] we want to fix it human beings are
[1:43:40] fixers by nature but what God is trying
[1:43:42] to do is stop that reflex of trying to
[1:43:45] take over cour ten Boom has a great
[1:43:48] quote where it says is
[1:43:51] prayer your spare tire or your steering
[1:43:54] wheel are you just going to prayer when
[1:43:57] you're in trouble and you need to get
[1:43:59] out of it or is it or is it leading you
[1:44:01] and guiding you in everything that you
[1:44:12] do from that time 1962 and when God
[1:44:15] calls a man to work for him he calls you
[1:44:17] from Total Annihilation from all the
[1:44:18] things of the world and the sins of the
[1:44:20] Earth separation God never did bless
[1:44:23] Abraham till he fully obeyed him he took
[1:44:26] his father the old man was always a hair
[1:44:28] in the soup or excuse that expression
[1:44:30] but he was always wrong in Abraham and
[1:44:32] then he got lot and then he finally went
[1:44:34] down there and after lot separated
[1:44:36] himself then God said to Abraham rise
[1:44:38] and walk through the land I've give it
[1:44:40] all to you it's all yours see he never
[1:44:42] fully blessed him until Abraham fully
[1:44:44] obeyed and you'll never be able to get
[1:44:46] anything from God and have favor with
[1:44:47] God my brothers and sisters wherever you
[1:44:49] are until we fully obey obey the word of
[1:44:51] God you make yourself miserable by just
[1:44:53] halfheartedly approaching
[1:44:54] it and there's another quote where
[1:44:56] brother Braham says you just get enough
[1:44:58] religion to make you
[1:45:01] miserable and what what what we need to
[1:45:03] do is just we have to get serious
[1:45:07] again go back to the altar not in terms
[1:45:10] of like getting saved again or baptized
[1:45:12] whatever but go back to to to where you
[1:45:15] were last on fire for the Lord and be
[1:45:18] like what has changed since then that
[1:45:20] has got me to this
[1:45:23] place and then move
[1:45:26] forward and living for God is is not
[1:45:29] that difficult it it really
[1:45:31] requires two things who can guess what
[1:45:34] those two things are read your Bible and
[1:45:37] pray that's it but do it
[1:45:40] sincerely don't do it like he's saying
[1:45:43] here half-heartedly approach it it is
[1:45:45] your
[1:45:47] lifeline it's your lifeline it's too
[1:45:51] late to play
[1:45:52] Church things are you look at Israel
[1:45:55] Israel is God's time piece things are
[1:45:58] wrapping
[1:46:00] up it's time to trick trim the
[1:46:04] lamps because what is that it's trimming
[1:46:06] all the excess that's not burning as
[1:46:09] well as it
[1:46:11] should because you get to the end and
[1:46:16] um you got to cut the fat it's like an
[1:46:19] athlete before a a like I say a pro
[1:46:21] fight he's cutting he's cutting as much
[1:46:23] fat as he can in order to make the
[1:46:25] weight if he's over the weight he
[1:46:28] doesn't do the
[1:46:29] fight and that's the thing for us it's
[1:46:31] not it's not that we have to put this
[1:46:34] pressure on ourselves to be perfect but
[1:46:36] our desire has to be that we want to be
[1:46:39] perfect you have to set yourself towards
[1:46:41] the Lord and He will come n
[1:46:44] thee so our desire is just that's the
[1:46:47] main thing about it is
[1:46:49] just there's nothing more
[1:46:52] important nothing else comes close work
[1:46:55] is fine we need it to to to live and to
[1:46:58] eat and all that stuff friends are fine
[1:47:00] it's it's nice to enjoy life but at the
[1:47:02] end of the day your whole purpose and
[1:47:04] your whole being has to be I am going to
[1:47:09] make
[1:47:11] it nothing
[1:47:16] else so at the end of the day you know
[1:47:19] in this situation the the the applying
[1:47:21] of the
[1:47:23] token was quite
[1:47:25] hard it was quite extreme what they had
[1:47:29] to do in order for them to get back into
[1:47:32] right
[1:47:33] standing and sometimes when we let
[1:47:36] things slide for a while it's going to
[1:47:39] hurt applying the token the kids get
[1:47:41] used to
[1:47:42] it and it's I've been there where you
[1:47:45] just you let the standard slide and
[1:47:46] you're going to say nope can't watch
[1:47:48] that
[1:47:49] anymore
[1:47:51] the whole thing is is just we have to
[1:47:53] stay vigilant daily you look at the the
[1:47:56] story Gideon it was only those who were
[1:47:59] kneeling and looking kneeling and
[1:48:02] looking and they never ever let their
[1:48:04] guard down no matter what it's like the
[1:48:06] other thing it's just like vacation
[1:48:09] vacation should be the best time for
[1:48:11] reading your Bible and
[1:48:14] praying I've yet to master
[1:48:17] it it's
[1:48:19] terrible you have the most amount of
[1:48:21] time and you never like this poor thing
[1:48:24] it's so
[1:48:26] lonely but it's just that's where I have
[1:48:29] to stop trying and go say God vacation
[1:48:33] is is not going well for me I need help
[1:48:35] with
[1:48:36] it because you get into this route of
[1:48:38] just trying and trying and trying and
[1:48:39] trying and trying and it's just why and
[1:48:41] why aren't I asking because God you can
[1:48:43] ask God simple things and he'll
[1:48:46] answer but at the end of the day when
[1:48:49] you do the right right thing there is
[1:48:51] always a war that comes in behind it God
[1:48:54] never God does not have any unpaid bills
[1:48:57] when he when he requires you to make a
[1:49:00] stand or to to to get your life clean
[1:49:03] and you obey obedience always has a
[1:49:06] reward it always always has a
[1:49:12] reward so this we're rounding down here
[1:49:16] now in Matthew Jesus says and if thy
[1:49:18] right eye offend thee pluck it out and
[1:49:20] cast it from thee for it is Prof for
[1:49:22] thee that one of thy members should
[1:49:23] perish and not that thy whole body
[1:49:25] should be cast into hell and If thy
[1:49:27] right hand offend thee cut it off and
[1:49:28] cast it from thee for is it is
[1:49:30] profitable for for thee that one of thy
[1:49:32] members should perish and not that thy
[1:49:34] whole body should be cast into
[1:49:36] hell so the principle here
[1:49:39] is don't let the body suffer because
[1:49:43] you're just trying to hold on to the one
[1:49:44] thing that you may
[1:49:46] like at the end of the day there's
[1:49:50] nothing that should
[1:49:52] outweigh what God requires from you for
[1:49:55] your life where there it be because the
[1:49:57] hardest ones more often not our
[1:49:59] relationships that those are hard those
[1:50:01] are hard family that's a really hard
[1:50:04] one because that's where that affection
[1:50:06] starts to and that reasoning starts to
[1:50:09] kind of work on you but God requires a
[1:50:12] full and total separation from unbelief
[1:50:15] no matter the sour
[1:50:17] source
[1:50:19] thorth
[1:50:21] and when you separate is only when you
[1:50:25] get blessed like Abraham with lot
[1:50:27] Abraham never got the promised son until
[1:50:30] he did a total
[1:50:32] separation so if you're not if the full
[1:50:35] flow of the blessings are not happening
[1:50:36] in your life what are you holding on
[1:50:38] to and what it requires is
[1:50:42] honesty it's hard it's hard to look at
[1:50:45] yourself um when that mirror of the word
[1:50:48] is presented before you and you see
[1:50:50] yourself as you
[1:50:52] are don't be the type that forgets what
[1:50:54] you
[1:50:57] saw there's a special Grace that comes
[1:50:59] from doing the right thing even though
[1:51:02] it's hard for the Lord because he'll
[1:51:04] always re he rewards it seven times
[1:51:06] greater every
[1:51:09] time uh if the musicians want to come or
[1:51:14] musician so Ezra was standing in the gap
[1:51:17] for Israel he was a man anointed in
[1:51:20] desperation for the
[1:51:21] moment and ultimately where did that
[1:51:23] desperation come from it was a love for
[1:51:26] God and for his people because he could
[1:51:29] not allow Israel to go the way that it
[1:51:32] did
[1:51:33] before he could not allow that to happen
[1:51:36] again so because he had a love for God
[1:51:39] his word and his people he was a vessel
[1:51:42] prepared and ready for the moment and
[1:51:44] what God does it God baptizes him and
[1:51:46] pours out that burden upon him and so
[1:51:50] uses him that he saves Israel from from
[1:51:53] from
[1:51:56] Annihilation because Ezra was where he
[1:51:59] needed to
[1:52:02] be and at are we holding back God from
[1:52:08] moving because we are not where we need
[1:52:10] to
[1:52:13] be because God has to use
[1:52:17] someone and once he has a group of
[1:52:19] people who are honest looking at at
[1:52:23] themselves sincerely crying unto the
[1:52:25] name of the lord it's only a matter of
[1:52:27] time for God to start
[1:52:34] moving we must have love before we can
[1:52:36] have faith when we have genuine love
[1:52:39] what does it do it pushes our faith out
[1:52:41] on the Battlefront for God genuine Godly
[1:52:45] love for God and for his word and for
[1:52:46] his people will push Faith out there
[1:52:49] love just takes a the hold of faith and
[1:52:51] just come on let's go and out it goes
[1:52:53] because that's what love
[1:52:57] does and when you and when when that
[1:52:59] happens there's there's there's nothing
[1:53:01] that can stand against
[1:53:04] it
[1:53:07] nothing so as bad as any situation can
[1:53:09] get in a home in a church at your work
[1:53:13] whatever it may be relationships
[1:53:14] friendships whatever it may
[1:53:16] be if we can get to a place where we can
[1:53:19] do it through love and you're working by
[1:53:23] faith then God can use you to change
[1:53:25] that
[1:53:27] situation because God is just crying
[1:53:30] he's crying out for you to be
[1:53:34] used so all God needs in any impossible
[1:53:36] situation is one desperate praying
[1:53:40] person the effectual fervent what does
[1:53:44] fervent mean burning hot
[1:53:48] strong longlasting ing
[1:53:52] continual the effectual fervent prayer
[1:53:55] of a righteous man availeth much you
[1:53:58] have no idea what the power of your
[1:54:00] prayer can do no
[1:54:03] idea I've had situation after it's been
[1:54:06] a bad week for work and Monday it just
[1:54:10] it was immediate one email from a client

[1:54:36] token on display in your home you have
[1:54:39] full rights full dominion over
[1:54:41] Everything You Touch full rights and
[1:54:44] Satan knows it and the moment that you
