me years ago and I did tell you that before and what no matter how he felt when he came to the door to church he always said it was a portion in here for me and I'm coming again and with that with that attitude you wouldn't go out empty you wouldn't go out disappointed so by grace come and get your portion tonight amen let's just sing it and brother George will come [Music] [Music] my [Music] that's me [Music] I can't [Applause] [Music] amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you order to thank you for your word we thank you for your spirit we thank you Lord for the desire to be in the house of the Lord and to learn more of your word as we struggle through dark Laodicea looking for the exit Lord we just pray that you would open your eyes to see the truth of the word or not just to memorize but to know you by the spirit and the leading and the truth Lord we thank you for this little song that is taken from Mary's words when the angel appeared to her Lord as the angel comes by now and opens the eyes of your people tonight may it be our prayer be it unto me according to thy word whatever you have for me for each one of your people here tonight may it be real may this be a turning point for each one open your word to us now and bless your people that are out there watching somewhere these words be a blessing to many we ask in Jesus name Amen you may be seated I was very happy to hear the beautiful music and you will find me a recording of that song won't you okay so we finished chapter 5 last night for those of you that were paying attention and we're going into chapter 6 now see how far we can get and we have one more service and we will not get through 28 chapters but we will take it easy so that people can digest as we go along so chapter 6 of the book of Acts verse 1 and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration well they were just like us weren't they had a few church problems and so the disputes came up among the people about some of the widows not receiving proper attention there were the native-born Jews and then there was the Jews that emigrated from other countries such as Greece and the widows in particular dependent on assistance from the local church so the Apostles had to institute church order some practical ideas for current situations help was needed now these assistance to the ministry as we'll read here in verse 3 in a minute they had to have certain qualification it couldn't be the first three people couldn't be whoever paid the most tides it had to be people they said seven amongst you of honest report okay no flaws follow the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business because the Apostles didn't have time to be you know serving the tables oh I'm sorry sister you didn't get enough this month and all that stuff somebody had to take care of that and so their first assignment was Social Work something that was commonly left to the women to do that is serving the meals cleaning up the mess after the meals vacuumed in the church dusting their organ and all the things that have to be done they needed help to do these things and so some of these brothers graduated on to more actively you know Ministry of the word now you got to remember that this this group of Christians these weren't even called Christians yet these these believers this was growing very rapidly if you remember back in chapter 1 to verse 15 there was 120 hiding in the upper room they didn't know how long then it was ten days Abraham said Sarah didn't notice 25 years they just waited until but God had it all planned out because he had these other all these other thousands of people gathered in Jerusalem at the same time and this had to overlap and coming at the same time you know so here's 120 right waiting up there in verse 8 of the chapter one he had told him to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Ghost you know comes upon you you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem out there in Judea over to Samaria to the uttermost part of the earth they they didn't have a globe at home to know what the earth looked like okay they hadn't been invented yet the global world might have been 300 miles in every direction so when he says the other most part of the earth they had no idea what he was talking about but when we get to chapter 2 and verse 8 here's all these people in Jerusalem and it says how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born so these Jews had come from all these countries in the 16 listed there that might have been more and they're born over there so they knew Hebrew because of the church and because the Scriptures are in Hebrew but they were born in those countries and they spoke those other languages now for the first time they're in Jerusalem that their date their yearly pilgrimage and they're hearing these Hicks speak their language yeah verse 11 of chapter 2 rabe Eunice's so forth do we hear them speak in our tongues and wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and we're in doubt and saying to one another what meaneth this and so they notice that they were they had a Galilean accent that's like the people that come from you know BC or someplace they have a different accent you know immediately and so here they're speaking their language with that accent well so as we saw yesterday there was three thousand heard the gospel in their own language they were baptized and they took the gospel home with them so now verse 8 of chapter one is beginning to have some effect that here's the reality they're taking it out there it's not these 12 or 11 disciples that's going to be in charge of it all but God immediately has these other guys taking it home so starting to go to all these other countries all of a sudden well they they were empowered you know and so then in verse 47 of chapter 2 added the church daily such as should be saved there's predestination and in chapter 4 verse 4 about 5000 men so there could have been up to 20,000 added that day so this thing's growing you know in chapter 6 verse 7 we read tonight and the Word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied now those of you that know anything about math you know 1 plus 1 equals 2 but when it multiplies it could really go fast you know multiplied in Jerusalem greatly ok and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith well yeah these priests you know a very few people could read back then the priests for some of them they could so they had read the scriptures and so they had it memorized they knew what the scripture said but here's is coming to Pastner in their lifetime Wow so they believed you know it's being manifested so verse 8 and Stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people okay so Stephen is one of the seven from verse five and a man of full of faith Holy Ghost power he had a great Ministry of wonders miracles amongst the people and he became the first Christian martyr okay so as we have been taught every revival produces twins right and most of the believers they love Stephen and they saw that he was used of God to minister the word in miracles and so forth but there were certain people we call them make believers today that they thought it was their mission to argue with the man of God uh-huh and when they couldn't out argue him that's right their verse 10 when they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit about which he spake what they do they suborn that means they paid money they paid cash money to false witnesses and said now you tell me here's what you're going to say after we give you this money we have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God you know money always works doesn't him there it is right there right there in the Holy Bible put money under the table and I go say this well so based on these allegations that flying around the religious police come along they grabbed him brought him before the Religious Council and those guys also had false witnesses says right there and they were bringing confusing a lot of accusations and how do they do that by repeating miss quotations little pieces of the message but in the wrong order misplaced out of harmony so let's look at verse 13 they set up witnesses and he said this man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against the holy place and the law and we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us that's pretty serious the gods man was confident you know and all that said in the council look steadfastly on Stephen and his face was like the face of an angel well everybody should have been on their knees right there but they were full of religious hatred they knew their prophets words perfectly and you got to say it our way or you're not you're out of here you go into the hot place you know and they're just you know full of it so that's the end of chapter six fifteen verses so chapter 7 verse 1 then said the high priest Stephen are these things so here's the microphone it's your turn well from there Stephen launches out into the deep waters it was God's Way of refocusing the people's attention away from Jerusalem see to the world at large it gives an eloquent history lesson from verse 2 all the way through verse 50 which we're not going to read right now but he makes four major points verses 2 through 8 is the founding of the Hebrew nation did not occur here in Jerusalem out there far away in Mesopotamia all about father Abraham then verse 9 through 37 it's all about the patriarchs and Moses the liberation of God's people didn't occur here in Jerusalem far away Egypt the Red Sea all about the signing I 0.3 was 38 through 39 was all about the law was given here in Jerusalem out there in the desert and then 39 through 50 it was all about the idolatry that the Hebrews had out there in the desert and then the building of the temple where it says that God does not live in a temple on a physical building but then we go starting at 51 can you look at your Bible while I read out of this other one here says oh you stubborn an insincere in heart and hearing you always resist the Holy Spirit as your father's did so do you which of the prophets have not your father's persecuted and murdered especially have they slained those who foretold the coming of the righteous one whom you betrayed and murdered well he just give him the microphone they're gonna let go you know you received the law by dispensation of angels and kept not it he kept it not when they heard these things they were enraged and gnashed her teeth and we're gonna get this guy they were mad you know really mad you see and so this this view of history by revelation brought to a real raging boil the growing conflict between the new religious movement and the city fathers see and we go on but he full of faith in and the full of faith and Holy Spirit looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God and he said behold I see the heavens open and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God then they crowd with a loud voice and stopped their ears with one Accord shouted threats against Stephen you know name-calling and all the stuff that goes on and they seized them and then took him outside the city and began to stone him and those who testified against him place their clothes under the care of a young man called Saul and they stone Stephen as he prayed saying our Lord Jesus except my spirit and as he knelt down he cried with a loud voice and said our Lord do not hold this sin against them when he had that said he passed away very very serious situation there and these weren't little rocks these four big sharp rocks they're throwing okay they had professional stone throwers now what Saul Saul right there never left his mind it was stamped in his mind and that's why I over there Jerusalem they got st. Stephen's Gate where they took him out they stoned him right there and that's where it happened now and we have the first mention here of Saul and he witnessed the death of Stephen he was probably too young to participate but he was a Pharisee in training and what he saw he never forgot it now he did probably didn't throw any rocks you know they were sharp rocks but he was one of the persecutors okay he was one of the many that hated the manifestation of God's Word in present tense they could repeat it perfectly they didn't have an iPad they didn't have nothing they read it and memorized it you know and then what and their their Hebrew Bible they have today is the same text that they had back then the same writing has come all the way down so they knew the word perfectly you know historical it's fine to quote it it's but what about the manifestation of the truth you know you have pets and you feed them special food so that the hair will be nice and all that there's gonna be a manifestation we are what we eat you know so here here they are memorizing the word they couldn't handle a manifestation and we hear it today say what he says oh you're on I got it I heard of things too in 50 years so we're gonna stay balanced you see so now these Pharisees they were the religious elite of Judaism the people that did believe the resurrection supernatural but they were very self-righteous there's probably nobody like that in Newfoundland but down where I live there's a lot of self-righteous people you know and they were the only ones that were really right it's okay yeah you can quote what you want to it I know I'm right you know and revelation was the last thing on their mind everything had to be letter-perfect every word of Moses today we legalists with zero revelation the Sadducees were also important religious people they denied the supernatural denied angels especially the resurrection they were the religious rationalist of the time they reasoned to rationalize and so here's where the fourth persecution began chapter 8 and verse 1 see care and Saul was consenting unto his death at that time there was a great persecution against the church was in Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the Apostles okay so with each persecution God's plan from chapter 1 and verse 8 was coming into sharper focus now this is about 31 ad here and everybody still huddled around Jerusalem but it took persecution to drive people out you know they would somewhere else to raise their family you know where it's not sort of so dangerous and so the gospel is leaving Jerusalem and it was all part of the larger picture that God already saw happening but persecution had to drive him out they didn't go there voluntarily you know so Pharisee saw he's one of the main troublemakers one of the instigators bringing persecution against the early church verse 3 as for Saul he made havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committed to them to prison that means he's not Haley means taking him prisoner and so his own confession is over here in Galatians chapter 1 he didn't hide anything Galatians 1 and verse 13 where he says here for you have heard of my conversation my lifestyle in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and I wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of our fathers so where it says here in verse of chapter 8 that he made havoc that means he brought trouble he brought confusion and guess what our God is not the author of confusion when you see something confusing coming up in our message today it's not of God just take a sharp right or left get away from it you see don't argue with them don't go on the internet think you're going to help those people they chose a path and it's one way they're not coming back forget it see after the death of Judas Iscariot the church leaders chose a brother by the name of Matthias and he's probably a good believer probably didn't ever do anything wrong but we never heard of him again that wasn't God's choice that was those guys they got together and chose him God's choosing on the other hand was a very short hook-nosed sarcastic short-tempered Jew yeah we've-- and his name was Saul and he's the one who's dragging these converts into court and jail and watching them be punished put to death now there's a movie that Hollywood found out last year paul the apostle of Jesus Christ it shows these very things it's very accurate very good and so these were people just like us they were just worshipping God in their home but if he came house to house and he saw a little cross or some little fish or some sign of of Christianity don't ask questions they didn't mind profiling ask questions you're going out of here you know so these things are still happening today and plus some places but later when he's converted God used him in a marvelous way even to be responsible for a large portion of the New Testament Scriptures much later when he's you know preaching the word openly but he was accused falsely he confessed to the authorities this I confess to you all that after the way which they call heresy that's the way I worship the God of my father's which was the god of their fathers too maybe believing all things which were written in the law and the prophets that could be our confession we you know what sets us apart from the Church of England in church whatever are down the road we believe all that's written in the law and the prophets we believe the whole scripture you know so we'll see more about Paul a little later now these early believers could have chosen the way of compromise they could have chosen an easier path a path or no resistance no criticism a path of compromise holding hands with the religious leaders that okay well we'll settle down here we'll do it your way you know trying to get along by fellowship but it that's not God's weight Martin Luther said Christ alone we don't need the beads we don't need all this nonsense we just need Christ alone you know so you know used to be that when you wanted to go somewhere you had a map book everybody over 45 remembers the map book right brother yeah but it's an alphabetical order you know so when you want to go somewhere you got to flip through the pages to make your way you know and but God's map is all on one page he's not flipping through the book you see from beginning the end he knows the whole thing he knows the details of every individual life all the little details what you're gonna wear tomorrow or we're gonna have four separate Ammar tonight Lord willing and all these details he already knows all this stuff you see and so you're only gonna be at peace when you get it all figured out no when you trust him yes Lord you you know you I give you full control you lead you be the guide I'll be still and I'll follow that's the only way you're gonna have peace so verse four therefore they were scattered abroad and went everywhere preaching the word now see in our way of understanding war they were all preachers no not necessarily no Francis of Assisi said nine hundred years ago preach always use words when necessary oh man we don't want to we want to let go you don't tell people no a lot of times it's better to just be still do it the Bible says be still I'm God don't need your opinions I'll take care of it you see so they went everywhere living their message you see so these first missionaries or they traveled far away oh yeah see in the in Matthew chapter 10 Jesus told them only go to the house of Israel don't worry about all this other people take care of them later only go to Israel so when they start moving away they located you know in Jewish communities for example Phoenicia which is Lebanon today that's 120 miles north of Jerusalem they sail all the way over to Cyprus that's 150 miles they went up to Antioch which is part of Turkey today that's 300 miles and so they took off not all of them but you know they would they left and the apostles are still in Jerusalem so now in verse 5 we have the man named Philip and he went to a city in from area at Samaria which is about 50 miles north of Jerusalem now there was this Philip here is one of the helpers of chapter 6 and verse 5 along with Stephen the Apostle Philip that's in Matthew 10 that he's a different one and he's having a great revival up here in Samaria many people are healed there's great joy but there's the twins again you can always count on it in this meeting there was a man by the name of Simon the sorcerer that's like a magician he's been working from the dark side and he had some kind of reasonable success with his magic and so forth and he was very involved in the occult and the verse 9 of chapter 8 what do we have here Simon okay sorcery bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that he himself was some great one in other words false advertising I'm really important well so this man was obsessed with power and self-importance you know and the people were you know blown away oh this man is the great power of God and he had many followers no one seemed to criticize him they marveled and suppose though you know there's great importance but God was not in the picture you see and so when the people now heard gospel down here this tent meeting with with Philip in the name of Jesus Christ there were signs and wonders many believed and were baptized even Simon himself you know he looked like he was a believer in verse 16 here okay so he's he's a believer and so then they called for Peter and John to come down and pray for the people that might receive the Holy Ghost verse 16 for as yet he was fallen on none of them only they had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and when Simon saw that through the laying on hands of the Apostles the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money oh there we are again with the money yeah you know he he want to be part of this program and he he offered money so you know maybe I can buy this magic trick you know and in verse 19 they said give me this power whosoever I laid my hands they could have the Holy Ghost - in other words I can help you guys you know of course this ministry probably wouldn't be for free I'd be the problem and so he heard the truth he want to be a part of the move of God but just couldn't detach himself from old Simon see let the old Simon die and yield himself to Jesus Christ so God used an anointed preacher preaching the gospel to shake him to reality here in verse 20 Peter said thy money perish with thee we don't need your cash he said because thou has thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money thou has neither part nor nor a lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent of this your sin and pray that God perhaps will take away the thought of thy heart and forgive thee so he discerned this case very well and course he immediately asked for prayer in verse 24 and we don't hear any more about him so we trust we'll see him someday we don't know so right in the midst of this great revival in Samaria the ends of the Lord appears to Philip in verse 26 and he says arise and go towards the south unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza which is desert okay so those names are in the news all the time and they're still there and this is about seventy miles away from where he's preaching go down there and it's all desert you know he didn't explain anything and that's choir what just get up and go so like brother Brent says God doesn't always tell his prophets everything no but he does arrange the details so in verse 27 we have a very important man he's he's a believer in the Hebrew religion he's a black man he's unmarried he's officer of the royal household actually he's the treasurer of the kingdom of Ethiopia so how that happened well because a long time ago when the queen of the south queen of sheba come up to visit solomon she became a believer and she took the hebrew religion back with her and here's results of it here this man had this important treasure of the kingdom had been up to Jerusalem to worship he's on his way back and today they're still hebrew believers in ethiopia and they found out about him a few years ago and they let him into israel you worship just like us you worship our God so now we have these black Ethiopian Hebrew believers in Jerusalem so anyway he's riding along and he's reading what would be a spoken word book he's reading a prophetic manuscript okay he's just going along in his chariot and all of a sudden here's Philip he's walking along beside the running along beside the chariot not questioning God said go so here he is and verse 29 he runs up alongside the chariot and he heard the man reading you know and he said hi how are you do you understand what you're reading we're paraphrasing a little bit verse 31 how can i except some man should guide me and he started philip that he should come and sit with him hmm so evangelist philip is now riding along with this important government official nice chair you know all the other everything and the man is reading the prophetic manuscript as I have chapter 53 where it says here the place where he was reading he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and I don't like a lamb done before his Shearer's he opened not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and as a person that's new to these things he asked in 34 so the eunuch answered Philips I pray thee of whom is the prophet speaking himself or some other man so the Evangelist never missing an opportunity started right at that point and preached Jesus Christ to the man and obviously they got as far as water baptism because all of a sudden the man says open here in verse 37 in 36 here's water you know can I be baptized and Philip said if you believe with all your heart it's okay and he said I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they both went down into the water well Philip and the eunuch and he baptized him and when they were come up out of the water the Spirit of God caught away Philip and the eunuch saw him no more he just pooped disappeared and he went on as the way to Ethiopia rejoicing but Philip was found at Esso Taurus asoto sotas passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea so this unnamed government official was the first African convert and the gospel was moving out of Jerusalem so this obedient evangelist experienced time travel he baptized the first African and he preached the three ethnic groups and one day straight their house did he get down there I had no chest had no fast cars boom almost said he's walking beside this chariot so he was led of the Spirit and God has taken care of the details okay we'll have questions and answers maybe tomorrow but it's all in your Bible moving on to chapter 9 verse 1 and 2 and saw yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogue's and if be found any of this way whether they were men or women didn't matter he might bring them bound back to Jerusalem so saul is a young fiery Pharisee legalist filled with hatred and murder against the disciples of our Lord why not because they're evil people but because we know exactly what the Prophet said and you guys are you know making this up we don't like the manifestation that we see in you people so we're gonna kill all of you and set this thing back the way it's supposed to be that's what the kind of their orders so he was out persecuting all the believers didn't matter who they were they were our brothers and sisters could have been children anybody that even looked like part of the way you know I'm the way the truth of life they took him away that was this that was his job and he was the best at what he was doing so he didn't wait for orders he begged for warrants you know anyone faintly associated the way will be brought back to headquarters and so the believers travelled far away seeking more peaceful surroundings this is possibly four years after the resurrection and God allowed this persecution of the believers in order they would scattered far and wide to bring more fulfillment to chapter 1 verse 8 to the end of the earth somebody had to take it he didn't come here to parachute the boat showed up here one day that's why it's called Conception Bay that's a Catholic word concept' the holy conception of Jesus Christ and Mary you know it's all together so you may not understand how God it's going to do something it's not your job the visions were William branham's rages they're not yours however God wants to put it together that's his business you see and so just remember that the scripture says be still I'm God I got to figure it out don't need your opinions you know God only wants our obedience so young Saul was a very zealous government agent out looking for anyone that complying with what they knew was right you know no problem with human rights no problem with profiling if you even looked like your part of the way prison death but his journey was interrupted by divine intervention now you won't find all of this on one page but if you consider chapter 9 1 through 18 chapter 22 1 through 21 and chapter 26 19 you'll find the following details so it's a very bright hot sunny day he's eagerly moving along towards Damascus about 130 miles to the northeast and about noon a very bright light appears now at noon it's pretty bright anyway so this much brighter light shows up shown all around him knocked them all off their horses and now they're very confused because this fearless commander this Pharisee in charge of the anti-christian campaign is now faced down in the dirt the uniforms all dirty and it looks like he's talking to himself we got a problem they all saw the light they all fell off their horses they all heard a sound but only saw heard the voice and he heard it in his language the Hebrew language Saul Saul why are you persecuting me now Paul I saw wasn't persecuting one person but he was persecuting all those that had the spirit of Jesus Christ so he's persecuting Jesus Christ Lord who are you you know and what's this brilliant light in his power where's all this coming from I'm Jesus of Nazareth the one that you have been persecuting and immediately he remembered the death of Stephen I never left his mind immediately he was disarmed he's helpless he's face down in the dust and he's even blind in the brilliance of the glory of God so he had to heal completely there was no way out there's no patching this up maybe whoa no finish so if you are one of God's elect or one of your children one of your whatever God will hunt you down he will find he does care it doesn't matter what's your goals what your plans are he will find you and bring you into the way and right here we could put in the short version of the story of mr. Chappel that's in jail he was raised where a very young age in the in the Pentecostal church but he saw where that he could sell this these these other items and make more money he became the most powerful man on the planet for selling drugs you know very important you probably know people that are hooked on these drugs they have to have him but he heard the gospel through the radio Oh heard that before see if there's in the literature so sent him a book Oh angel came to me he liked it hey we need more I got 10,000 people with guns they all need to hear this so we gave him a memory stick published it for his people and a few other things and so he's just waiting for baptism but he's a believer even during the trial he never said a word you'll notice he's just sat through grand all his all the people they brought up through normal no telling how much money they spent to get these guys to testify against him these were his associates yeah we saw this okay so he's guilty no problem he's fine he never said a word the President of Mexico said that's a different man that's not the same guy that did all this so he testified to his conversion so anyway God will find you if you're his elect just like Paul so so Saul because we haven't called him Paul yet remember that Saul he says what do you want me to do arise go to Damascus so he had a glorious conversion and he had a direct Commission get up I have a purpose for you I will be with you it all comes down to faith in me nothing you can add or subtract Jesus alone so God had a plan Saul was not disobedient he obeyed he'll be perfectly he stayed in tune and stayed true to the word he didn't compromise and so we get to verse 10 of chapter 9 I read here and there's a certain disciple of Damascus named Ananias there was a common name back then and to him said the Lord in a vision Ananias he said behold I'm here Lord and the Lord said unto him get up go to the street that called straight give him the address inquire the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus he's over there praying hmm so God was already working at both ends preparing everything so Ananias we think of the deceptive property owner from yesterday there was another one in chapter 23 a self-righteous high priest and so forth but this Ananias in verse 10 is a real believer and he was a follower of the way and he'd heard about Pharisee Saul you know he was a bit cautious yeah and the Lord says to him in the vision he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias now that's you coming in putting his hand on him that he might receive His sight so Ananias being very cautious he argues a little bit Lord I've heard many things about this man and how he's treated your Saints in Jerusalem and he's come here under authority of the high priest and so forth but the Lord said get up and go he's a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name not just the stories bear my name to the Gentiles King's children Israel I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake that had be very difficult so he goes up finds the address there's a blind man praying he didn't say good morning didn't say anything just goes in price Horton verse 18 and immediately there fell off his eyes like scale he received his sight forthwith and arose up and was baptized and we received meet he was strengthened then was saw certain days with disciples which read Damascus so he had been without anything to eat for three days you'll read there also so we immediately he began to preach at Damascus and many people heard him and verse 21 but all that heard him were amazed and said isn't this to the one that destroyed that our brothers and sisters in Jerusalem and came here for that intent and he might bring them bound the chief priests so saw increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which would dwell to Damascus proving that this is the very Christ he was totally convinced he was preaching to others and these people that are questioning these were his close associates a few days before you know and after many days of preaching verse 23 and after many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to kill him his buddies that he was working with now they're after him those people don't mess around you know they they how many pieces you know you out of here our friend over there Ruben you know he had he had a son and a daughter well the the daughter married a loser it happens you know so this guy would squander their money and Rubens always bailing him out well he's just you know had it with these people with this guy and he's telling his friends and so he's got a lot of friends at her Arabs and so the Arab said now look Ruben you don't have to stress over this you don't have to say a word just write a number here on the paper that's the number of pieces we will chop him in and nobody ever know about it it disappear and they can do it so these guys just you know solves in the way they we got a killer did they just think that way well this is the first attempt on his life here in verse 23 and this is about the third year of his preaching and then verse 24 but they're laying way it was known of Saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him why is that because every city had a wall around it did it anyway airplanes if he gonna come in you got to come through this gate so they're watching the gates watching him to come out they're gonna grab him then the disciples took him by night I let him down over the wall in the basket well a great idea and he got away okay so now he's over Jerusalem and he tried to get with the disciples but they were all afraid of him verse 26 and believed not that he was a disciple well no kidding you know if these destroyed grandma and a whole bunch of other people it's gonna be very hard to trust this man I mean anybody can quote it but is it real and so they didn't know we're too sure about it you know verse 27 but Barnabas he's also known as the son of encouragement took him and brought him to this to the Apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and told the whole story and he was with them coming and going out of Jerusalem and he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and they disputed against the Grecians and they went about to slay him it goes on and on you know they're trying to get him but there was second attempt on his life people have a hard time adapting to change they just can't handle it you know getting with God's program receiving the revelation of the word they want it the way they learned it in the Baptist Church no this is a different dispensation this this you know that God has a better program today so anybody can read and repeat we got we got all kinds of people carrying spoken word books well they got it just right down tight what he said but what about the manifestation you see you got to receive by revelation the word lives through you and that's much different so to change the scene Paul Saul goes away to his hometown Peter and the other disciples were a busy and here in chapter 13 chapter 9 verse 32 it tell us about the came to pass as Peter passed through all the quarters you know he's visiting different ones he came also to the Saints which were at Leda that's out where the airport is today and there he found a certain man named named Aeneas which had kept his bed eight years been on the bed never moved for eight years and he was at the policy very sick and Peter said at him Aeneas Jesus Christ makes you whole arise make a pre-bid he rose up immediately there's power in the name but it depends how you use it what atmosphere but it's real and all the dwell at Leda and Sauron saw him and turned to the Lord so with a group of believers because of this miracle hey this is the right way and so then while Peters in that needs away from Jerusalem he's he's you know quite a ways away it says there was a job a certain a of certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is Dorcas so that's the same name Tabitha Dorcas same thing and she was full of good works you know she had made all kinds of quilts and all kinds of things and she was sick and she died and they had her laid out in the on the bed and so Leda was near Joppa and the disciples heard that Peter was over there so hey come over here we got a problem so verse thirty-nine Peter Rose went with them and when he was come they brought him to the upper chamber and here's all these people crying and showing the great deeds and things she didn't made and so forth Peter puts them all out they out of here so he kneels down prays and turning to the body Tabitha arise Children's her eyes when she saw Peter she sat up he gave her his hand lifted her up and when you called the Saints and the widows presented for alive and it was known throughout Joppa and many believed on the Lord and it came to pass that he tarried many days in Joppa with another man named Simon the Tanner and it's 7:30 we've got time for one more chapter can't leave you hanging so he's the Simon the Tanners house now forty miles up the road it's a place called Caesarea sesor real is a town of receive 80 thousand people at the time and the Roman general they had made him a nice house well there's a very nice nice seaside place and there's a Gentile man up there by the name of Cornelius he was in charge of what was called the Italian regiment as many as possibly six hundred soldiers and he had a vision about three o'clock in the afternoon and his name was called from the other dimension okay he said he looked at the angel so it was more than a vision there was a visitation and he was afraid and what is it Lord what is it verse 4 of chapter 10 here let's see what it says what is it Lord and he said unto Him thy prayers and that alms are come up as a memorial before God and now you need to send two men send men to Joppa and call for one called Simon Peter is it Simon the Tanners house by the sea gives him the address and he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do well isn't that interesting why didn't the angel himself tell him the story he's telling me your prayers are heard God loves you and there's a program for you but he's got to go soon for that man to come here to tell you brother Brennan says God could have chose the Sun or the wind or whatever the palm trees but he chose man to preach the gospel it's all through the New Testament it's on a little mini tapes we got to quote somewhere to that effect it's not a mystery it's Paul's gospel didn't call no tape recorder nothing else called men to preach the gospel and there's one of them right here so we got through that part so in verse 7 he sends three trusted men down to Joppa just as the angel told him that took off they traveled that very night arriving about noon the next day okay meanwhile Peter is resting taking a couple days off and he's they the the homes back then were flat I had flat roofs and he's up on the top of the roof maybe a little bit of breeze maybe a little tarp there for shade and in verse 10 you know he's getting hungry they're cooking lunch downstairs he's getting hungry and he goes into a vision into a supernatural experience okay now a seer is a prophet same thing they live in two dimensions William Brennan says I live in the other dimension more than half the time so he gave me you can be here preaching and he's seeing 300 people here well obviously it's not 300 people here but he's seeing angels and you know everything so when it comes to numbers leave him alone he knows what he's talking about this is more than what you can see you know and so it's very natural for them to see more than what you can see so in the scriptures I see here an 11 so he sees heaven open this is this experience he has and a sheet comes down tight at the four corners we can imagine and in this great sheet is all kinds of beasts all kinds of animals and the wild beasts creeping things all kinds of animals and so what happens he in the in the scriptures God gave the Jewish people certain dietary laws for good reasons he knows what he's talking about things that could eat things that should not eat and so God is showing here in symbols to the man that has the keys to the kingdom that it's time to turn the corner and the interpretation of this vision is the God the gospel is for everyone not just the Jewish people it's time to spread out a little bit and because they're whole everybody up to them was Jewish had all this history GRANDMONT everything well now it's time to turn the corner and so these laws were so ingrained and part of their their life that Peter begins to argue with the angel which is nothing new for Peter so the OI says rise Peter kill and eat oh no no no I've never eaten such the stuff is that oh no no not me and the boy said the second time what God hath cleansed don't you call common you know and so the voice you know the second time hey pay attention Peter it's not a debate and he comes up three times and then the vision disappears so in verse 17 while he's still arranging these new orders as mine Oh God said so on three visitors are downstairs and so he's getting this clear in his mind about the Jews and the Gentiles and the Spirit of God tells him hey there's three men downstairs looking for you get up go down there go with them I have sent them to look for you host the whole story is here I mean anywhere you want to open your Bible anywhere those two pages you can make fantastic movie anywhere same with spoken word book anywhere you want to open it you know that's great and so um he goes downstairs and I'm the one you're looking for how can I help you so they explained the whole thing about the vision that the Cornelius had and so forth and so he invites him in they spent the night the next day they started walking and the following day they arrived assess Surya now Cornelius had been waiting for them see all his news was this visitation send men to get this guy named Peter that's all he knows so he sends him now here they come back with Peter and the meantime he's calling all his relatives all his close friends man house pack outs or not and so excuse me man so when Peter comes through the door this fearless commander of six hundred soldiers goes to his knees to worship this is the this is the person the angel told me about this hey it's real it's come to pass you know genuine servants of God did not accept worship rule number one okay and so of any kind so here was the man of God this is the very one that they told me James will told me there's a spokesman for the Lord the man of the keys he had been used to God for many miracles even raising the dead just a couple days before you know and even though Peter had made many mistakes hey he had a mouth problem just like some of us we ocean said that huh he argued with to Jesus he argued with the angel but he was learning balance okay it was hard but he was learning and he was teaching others so he when he got inside the house you know got past the the hey kerela stand up me I'm a man like you so when he gets inside the house the first thing he said where's it at verse 28 here you all know that it's unlawful for a man like me being a Jew to keep company with you all from another nation but God has shown me that I should not call anything common or unclean aha so it was his vision he gave the interpretation so let's be sure remember that one we read brother Browns visions it's his vision it doesn't depend on us tricking it out you know and so it was illegal they shouldn't be there you know you don't you don't deal with those people and so that was the the the translation of it you know we have stick very strict segregation but God has showed me a better way so he was he was moving out of his comfort zone see he was taught a certain way but by divine permission he can visit with these people and so you see God gives the experience of the visions of the Prophet only the Prophet can bring the proper interpretation you see this large seed these animals what God asked us interpret it we didn't ever come up with this translation you know but that's what it was God has shown me and so we're simply that the the repeaters of the word we're not here to figure it out and this means there and I think it means that no just repeat and declare the manifestation of God's prophecy he'll take care of it God does not require our opinions our ideas but just be yielded you know flexible and available and that God will accomplish his plan now so once he cleared the air with that that you meeting with Gentiles verse 29 therefore I came unto you without gain saying no didn't as soon as I was sent for I asked therefore what intent have you for me you hold about what do you why'd y'all send for me see so verse 33 33 they were totally ready for whatever God had there's no prejudice no preconceived ideas whatever God has we want it so when we're living our gospel today people want to see Christians they don't want they could care less about seventh seal also stuff just this when we'll see somebody that lives the word that was the success of brother brems ministry that he just lived the spirit of the Bible he didn't have you know prophet you know Neil no nonsense oh that what so it worked you know so here he is preaching to a humble home meeting Gentiles for the first time and in ten verses he gives them the whole Gospel message simple and to the point and let's look at verse forty for example here was that him God raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all people but unto witnesses chosen before of God even us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead not me not anybody else God is to judge we can just live our gospel God will judge okay and so it's very important today when there's satanic forces everywhere taking the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ all Jesus wasn't God well I think he was so I'll leave it alone brother Wren said he was and taking the DD out and placing it somewhere else may God keep us true keep us faithful verse 44 the preaching of the word a very short sermon was so powerful to these Gentile people first time they heard all this stuff that the Holy Spirit fell on them in the service manifested by speaking in different tongues magnify God even before they were baptized God can do anything if somebody believes and is killed well they're part of it nobody said they had to be baptized some some people never were baptized I know a whole lot of people that they believe they were killed immediately because they believe you see and so God can do any thing you see so verse 47 Peter says over here can any mad for any man forbid water these should not be baptized which has received the Holy Ghost as well as we did and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord and the and they prayed and they they prayed him to tarry certain days okay so God God is not bound to a certain program God can do anything let him be the judge you see so we've met Barnabas son of encouragement he gave generously chapter four then let in chapter nine he befriended sald a converted agitator we met Ananias and Sapphira and his wife make believers tried to lie to the Holy Spirit we met Deacon Stephen went from serving the widows to defending the faith before the authorities and was brutally killed for his testimony we met Philip the Evangelist experienced time travel and preached the three different ethnic groups in one day the African minister of finances who was the first Gentile believer in chapter 8 we met brother Ananias normal Syrian believer in Damascus was sent by God to preach for God's chosen but it was the church's worst enemy oh they had to be tough and then there's Cornelius the powerful army officer that loved God tried to worship God servant and became a real believer and saw the government agent in charge of anti-christian campaign of whom God said he's my man I've got plans for it so there's many more to come tomorrow 10 o'clock god bless you do you want to wear anybody out
