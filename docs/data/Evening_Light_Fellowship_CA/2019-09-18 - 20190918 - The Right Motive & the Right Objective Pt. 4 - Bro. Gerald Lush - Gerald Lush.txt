Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah a man thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord for your grace amen now I believe [Music] [Music] [Music] a man praise the name of the Lord praise God Lord blushes they may in turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 4 the book of Deuteronomy chapter 4 appreciate our brothers amen for sherry the brothers special a man concerning the bride and the bridegroom praise the Lord god I pray grace that we got faith we got revelation of the bride and the bridegroom he may is not just a doctrine but it's a revelation it's a reality in our hearts a man of who we are where we come from and where we're going a man by the grace of God a man just to ask your grace to keep the Saints are the yes with some of them are Saints in prayer in Buuren and as I've given some of you to understand that sister Betty's cousin Jessie Jessie is is not well and really doctors have not given her much time to to live well we told her we're praying for us she said well you can keep praying and she wants us to keep praying for a man but she has lost 100 pounds and again as she's sister Betty's aunt aunt betty is her daughter and of course even Jessie has lost her daughter her daughter died when she was in her 40s and also her husband died when he was in his 50s and a number of years ago and Jessie looked after her mother for many many years until Jessie got sick and they had to put her Rena in in a senior zone and she's but she knows that as far as the understanding is that her daughter Jessie is is about to die but she's been brain that she would at least live she saw hope she's still alive she said when I turned 95 years old and she'll be 95 Friday now this writing and she was hoping that she said I hope that she'll she'll be she'll be there so but during the gathering for the birthday I don't think that she'll be able to make it so we pray the grace of God to Jesse and of course that Jesse's brother is also fighting cancer and they've already lost two brothers to cancer and they died again when they're in summing the 40-some in the 50s so most of really aunt Betty's children are gone on before her amen so it's a tremendous test of faith for sure for for our sister and Betty to to endure all these things and to go on trusting the Lord amen because we have been with her and we prayed with her when she was with Jesse in in the apartment they were in there oh yeah we usually go in and visit them and pray with them to encourage them to keep pressing on by the grace of God so keep Aunt Betty and prayer and keep Jessie and prayer because it is serious and of course sir we met it was only a couple of days ago that we met Jesse's sister pearl and her husband oh my remember his name but her husband in in the mall now I we didn't see them but they saw us and he saw us and in and they came over to greet us and so we and she's also sick and a serious sickness - so the grace of God be with her pearl and her husband of course he's easier because he's got together some something put in here to control his heart and he's also got to have implants in his ears so it's amazing but again you know thank God for the grace in your life yeah grace of God because we're not getting younger we're getting older and even to you that are in your 30s and 40s you're getting older a man so he should pray the grace of God to those that are that are above you amen so God be with us is my prayer a man and God be with aunt Betty's family at this time and also we have been informed that sister Betty's brother oldest brother in Grand Bank at this time is not well and so we pray grace to him and that's a Herbert Dunford so the grace of God to Herbert amen so he's he's emotes i guess 78 years old now so God's grace to us all amen but the Bible says threescore years and ten a few more if by reason of strength and they shall be filled with pain and sorrow amen to God be the glory amen in Deuteronomy chapter 4 if we go to the word remember sister Betty and prayer she had problems again of course with the pain in her neck and there and her back in her hips and so on so the grace of God to her amen and pray for because she's got to wait until January for an appointment with specialist so it's another almost another three months amen in Deuteronomy chapter 4 and beginning to read at verse 7 for what nation is there so great who had God so nigh onto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for and what nation is there so great that as statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I have set before you this day only take heed to thyself a man this understand this received the counsel of the word only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest I forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life God deals with us in our hearts God deals with us in revelation in our hearts in experience in our hearts it's the Holy Ghost on the inside of the inside so again as says keep thy soul diligently lest I forget the things which ionize have seen unless they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons especially the day that stood it thou stood us before the lord thy god in Orab when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they should live upon the earth a man and that they may teach their children you're responsible to train them in the way that they should go a man now the nature they were born to with well you're training them in another nature a man the right nature and he came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire onto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and thick darkness and the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire and you heard the voice of the words but saw no similar toot only he heard a voice grace that we hear the voice in all that we see grace a we hear the word of God the revelation and he declared unto you is covenant praise the Lord Alleluia which he commanded you perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land whether he go over to possess it god bless his words you may be seated amen turn with me to the book of Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12 and beginning to read at verse 25 warnings and instructions and considering the thoughts that we want to put emphasis on again tonight and hopefully to bring it to a conclusion but as a result of study for tonight I discovered that the prophet of God put more emphasis on motive and objectives than what I realize I thought was only maybe a few thoughts here and a few thoughts there but I discovered that he has put the emphasis on motives and objectives right motives right objectives spiritual motive spiritual objectives hundreds of times since 1953 that if you do a research on the internet regarding the message of the hour you'll find that a number of under times that he mentioned motive and objective and he brings into the emphasis his motives and his objectives in doing what he was doing his motives and his objectives in his ministry his motives and his objectives in his relationship with Jesus Christ a man and he has put the emphasis on well this is my motive this is my objective this is why I believe Jesus this is why I serve Jesus this is why I do this and this is why I do that this is my motive and this is my objective so what it what is your motives and what are what are your objectives for being even being here tonight a man you're gonna have a right motive and you got to have right objectives a man according to the Word of God according to the will of God it is not again it is not my will it is thy will a man so Jesus kaitlin's I say Jesus came to that in the third pole of his ministry not in my will but thine be done a man why was it why wouldn't he come to that pressure and then that test because the grade the greatest trial of our faith the greatest manifestation of faith would be in the third pole a man and as it was with our Lord Jesus Christ so it was with the with the prophets in the Old Testament so it is with the with the New Testaments messengers and the New Testament Saints and the New Testament prophets a man but I tell you the third pull of our of our experience with God is the greatest test of our faith a man as it was with Jesus soon as what was with the Apostles as it was with Jesus who was with the church all the way down through the ages as there was with Jesus saw was with Martin Luther a male it was his motive and objective a man that came to the test when he took his stand for the revelation that God had given him and it was nearing the end of his ministry brother that they had to take him as a were denied him because why because there were still those that were endeavoring to kill Martin Luther there were still those that were endeavoring to kill John Wesley a man and again when it comes to the Pentecost revival because they stayed with their motives and their objectives in believing what they believe and taking the stand that they took a man they are they're just they had to take the the the rejection of the world a man praise the Lord but again they took their stand for the truth they took their stand for the word even though even though that the world began begin to mock them make fun of them and to fight the Pentecostal revival yet it was a revival that was greater than Wesley's revival greater than Luther's revival or mine they said the Pentecost revival was a worldwide revival man and brother and God God was pointing to an even greater revival which is the bride' revival and that also was a worldwide revival a man now the Pentecost said signs and wonders and the Pentecost and the gifts of the Spirit but brother the bright revival and the Ministry of the Son of Man it was the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ a man not just not just the anointing of the Holy Ghost to do this and to do that no no it was Christ himself coming down to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart it was Trace himself coming down to call out the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ a man not just the call of the the Methodists or the Lutheran's or the Pentecostals but her brother he was coming - to the bright it was Brittany Alleluia it was Brittany me he was calling out his right role what we think that was just in this hour just in this age no no it was in the pentacle it was anything it was in the day of Pentecost but that's when that's when again when Jesus begin to deal with his bride that's when Jesus began to unite with his bride in the Pentecostal age the first stage brother right on down through under finally it come to a conclusion a man and Alleluia and the bride and the bridegroom became one and the right in the right room in turn entered into a Alleluia an absolute fellowship praise the name of the Lord the province the province represented God but brother than it came to God prophet trace the name of the Lord but then all down through they represented Jesus in the braid the representative Jesus - finally Alleluia - finally Christ with may flesh in his right a man not just a little here and a little there but it was the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the bride but it was God in the promise to embody the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in the god prophet praise the name of the Lord hallelujah as God was doing it in India in the Old Testament so God was doing this in the New Testament God was revealing the Old Covenant God revealed the New Covenant a man praise the name of the Lord and brother and I and we know that there's brethren going off with these false teachings concerning a third Testament no brother there's there's no nothing in the Bible concerning a third Testament man it's the first Testament is the second Testament it is the old it is the new a man the new the new one is the one that concludes and takes us into eternity by the grace of God amen so this is tremendous god help us to see him what he has done and what he did anyway and what he's doing a man to see brother that what he did in the Old Testament and what he what he's doing in the New Testament a man going from the prophets to the god prophet and going from from the the representation of Christ in the bride a man in the first stage on to finally it is same as the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the bride a man it was in the black room now sin the bride a man is a tremendous revelation amen but again we need that revelation in order to get us into the rain to the faith that we need in this age a man the God prophet had to come on the scene and God was made flesh in the in the in that God prompted why because brother he had to do something that the other prophets couldn't do he had to lay his life down and pick it up again a man and now the bride has got to do something of the other those in the other angels could not do and they do Alleluia and that is to bring forth the resurrection and the rapture a man then I judge not just look good and be a witness of this me a witness of the resurrection be a witness of the rapture and then lay down their lives yeah they lay down their lives when they couldn't pick it up why because they had the weight for that that that part of the bride to come they had to wait for the FIR for God to able to bring that in to a conclusion a man so that the fullness of the Godhead bodily would come in the bride a man and if the fullness of the Godhead bodies of the bride was she's got in her was a bridegroom adding in and the resurrection and the rapture praise the Lord a man God was waiting on Jesus now and now could no know Jesus is waiting on the bride praise the Lord Alleluia why for the resurrection and the wraps are all God elbows Lord bird brother sister we better we better make our are calling an election Shore we better make sure that we had the right motive for being in the message we have the right objective her for believe in this message jesus said the right motive the right objective for doing what he did a man Jesus Lee the right motive and right objective for eventually a man moving from the second pole to the third pole a man he knew that there was a change coming in his ministry there is a change coming in the life that he was living there was a change coming in the message that he had 2000 years ago yes he did because the Bible says that he turned and what'd he do he said his face toward Jerusalem amen because there he was gonna eat was going to be retrained it was there he was going to lay his life down both praise the Lord he was going to pick it up again a man praise the Lord now the other prophets couldn't do it they laid their lives down but they couldn't pick it up again they're waiting on him to come hallelujah and when he would pick up his life he would pick up theirs because they would say they would also as the Bible says they arose a man came and rolled from the dead and they came and appeared and went into the city and appeared on to our mini and so on amen because why because the God probably was there a man he did what they couldn't do any man and jesus knew what he was going to do but he knew the place he had the pain he knew what he'd had to endure a man he had a motive in coming he had an objective in coming he had a motive in coming through the womb of a woman like myth like Mary a virgin to be virgin born hey man and there was a motive and there was an objective a man and a motive an objective that he knew even though even as a young boy a man when he was he went into the into the synagogue and here he was just just a few years old here he was teaching teaching in this the elders in the synagogue teaching the priesthood a man they were amazed at his understanding of the word a man and then well of course when Mary and Joseph went looking for him she she just tried to get him almost she didn't mean to say that but that was that was human a million and she said she's an a they Gino God did your mother and your father have been seeking you for three days and so on his mother and father well who was his mother and father and she and and he knew that it wasn't Joseph I know what they thought concerning the answer that he gave but he knew it she wasn't his mother and she wasn't he's fun and he and Joseph wasn't her father his father no no it was God was his father a man he was merchants mourn by the grace of Almighty God he knew where he come from he knew way was here and he knew who he was going hey man why wasn't this young boy in the temple and he was teaching the elders of the temple and teaching and teaching the screen to describes in the end and the varices and so on in the temple a man and they were all amazed that he knew the word there right there Jesus teaching them hey man he knew more about the word they knew a man so brothers sisters our saintly in this hour that was the braid now it's the braid grew it know that was the bridegroom now it's the bride amen brother not a part of the bride a we have come to the conclusion of the bride brother we we're not we're not when I just saw why on the part of the bride we are the conclusion of the bride a man now then no no the bride is now finished now the bride is complete now the bride is brother and the Alpha has to wear the Alpha and the Omega a man by the grace of God if the fullness of the Godhead body is in the bride the bride is Alpha and Omega a million it is the beginning of the bride that is the end of the bride it is the beginning of the call the end of the call Amen now brother has come to perfection the revelation of the resurrection the revelation of the rapture praise the Lord now that there's going to be brothers where we are experiencing it it is now amen praise the name of the Lord is not what God is going to do is what God is doing and God hallelujah God praise the Lord God finished a bride god but God Chi entered into Christ Christ entered into the bright and then there's an invisible union of the bride and the bridegroom praise the name of the Lord hallelujah that he that he has accepted her as she has accepted him brother I pray God in the name of Jesus al bust Lord to get us a greater and greater revelation of bride and amen brother let's go beer is not just doctrine or I believe this too often I believe this revelation that revelation brother it's got more to do than that amen God's requiring more of us than that amen now God is God is looking for the bride to do what a bride is gonna supposed to do God looking to looking for what it what he has ordained us to do in this hour brother he's looking for something beyond what it was Luther did beyond what Wesley did beyond what the Pentecostal see amen brother are we are we going forth to do what God of God is looking for in us are we going forward to do what God is looking for for for us to do amen are we really believing it are we praying for it are we calling for it are we hungry and thirsty amen for what God is expecting of you and me in this age amen Luther when indeed what God was expecting to him and the other day but God would expect you know them the Pentecostals oh they lived it morning noon and night amen and they were they there the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen they were testified of this testified of that hey man Alleluia and God was testifying to the world through them amen so what a what is our witness in the world what is our testimony to the world amen so what God has ordained in this hour in the bright age is God bruh making it flesh in you and me amen is God making the road the resurrection of the rod for a reality in you and me Amen resurrection and the rather the reality of it brother beyond what any other age had amen brother sister listen the the Jesus laid down his life and and picked it up again resurrected then he then he went on into the rapture with the Old Testament Saints but the pending sakes of the early Pentecostal age their brother they they never experienced it all mine they they met the resurrected Lord and they saw him being raptured and so on and they know they they also met other Saints that had rose from the dead man but still Jesus gave them instructions now he said going to Jerusalem go to the Upper Room and you wait and he said you're gonna get power you're going to get the anointing amen praise the Lord they're going to experience resurrection in their soul but not in their body amen they're going to experience the rapture in their soul but not in their body you have the quicken who were dead in sins and trespasses and you have been caught up into Everly places in Christ amen by the grace of Almighty God but if they were resurrected they were caught up spiritually we're resurrected they caught up a man spiritually a man in an experiencing greater resurrection greater anointing of the rapture then they experienced amen because God is bringing the rapture to it to a climax God is bringing the resurrection to a climax in the bride age in those who are the bride brother sister let's make our calling and election sure not just that oh I'm the seed of God and I am and I'm bear I'm saved no we got to make your calling and election sure as bride a man not just so I'm a Christian and I'm a believer on

right oh yeah oh they started that number of years ago when it comes to when it comes to doing what they're what they're doing today but it got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and brother what it shows that the devil is the god of this world and Satan is anointing them or they're under Satan's influence it is a satanic spirit that they are under making them do this and drew do this dress this way act this way and so on it's absolutely amazing amen so brother make sure you're bright if not you're gonna be left here amen if you're not brides are gonna be left here to die and they lay down your life in the Great Tribulation amen because there's going to be those out there that's gonna take their stand against what they're seeing and they'll be killed they'll lay down their life but the bright but jesus promised that the bride he wouldn't do that no yeah he probably knew he told him that this was going to come up on the earth but he said I want to offer you to endure that oh yeah he said I will make them of the synagogue of Satan Satan the synagogue of Satan the Church of Satan yeah he saw it say they are Jews and or not or say they're Christians than or not me oh and he said they do lie and say Peola I will make them to come and to worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee a man you're the right praise the Lord and he said because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee amen you kept the word of my patience he said I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the

the shelf he he did put the emphasis on him under the Pentecostal revival but now the emphasis is not on the gifts but he said they're still there yeah so grace of God so we make our calling Alexis sure let's make sure that we're not done down in Luther's just Luther sage Wesley's AIT's a Pentecostal age were in the bright age a man and his climaxing the Pentecostal aids with the coming of the Lord with the resurrection amen so brother if you're just Pentecostals you just got this you just got that you're gonna be here when when the bride's gone you got to have the revelation of the bride

bright Amen that what he started he is finished amen now he's calling you up by the grace of God and He has given us the faith that we need for resurrection he has given us the faith we need for rapture that is the third pole that is the conclusion brother that is that is the motive of the objective of the bright Amen his resurrection and rapture hey man moto jigme is not just to gloat and and and and witness about the gifts and witness about this and witness about that it's the resurrection of rapture with witnessing one to another amen and remember again we're the children of the light day not of the night by the grace of God there's too many there just oh I'm just a believer believer but I tell you if you're not resurrected spiritually you won't be resurrected physically and if you're not raptured spiritually you won't be raptured physically no no if you're if you haven't been caught up and you're living a spiritual life you think spiritual you act spiritual you react spiritual you respond in a spiritual way you know what comes to when it comes to what you're experiencing in this world oh yeah if you're Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory brother sir Jesus don't just go on no he lives as Allah you live it if you don't say it you live it and you don't say it sometimes you don't have to say this don't have to say that but you live it it's coming your life you're not gonna you're not gonna compromise with your life no you're not gonna caramelize with your thoughts and your opinions about this and isn't this no you'll not be ashamed of it you're not afraid of it brother what is your motive and your objective amen what was your motive and objective when you come to this message what was your motive and objective when you went through the process of repentance amen what was your motive and objective when you got baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man see like the prophet of God said he said you can you can experience this you can be baptized and he didn't go to hell that's right you can ask mr. Issa can I belong here and go to hell can I have this clothes and go to hell why if your motive was not writing your objective is not right he said God doesn't recognize it who said that prophet oh yeah he said that yeah he said always said if your motive was not right he said your objectives not right he said God doesn't doesn't recognize it God doesn't see it God doesn't hear it he said God he said ghost by a right mode and a right objective amen God give Abel the right motive and the right objective praise the Lord Cain never added he he wouldn't did what he did but his motive was right his objective wasn't right hey man I traitor this okay Cain's Akane's that motive an objector was down here but Abel's was way up there Cain was he was time Abel was eternity oh yeah why it went beyond the flesh to his soul he wanted Redemption he want to get back and fellowship with God glory glory glory what is your motive and your objective for the resurrection and the rapture is it because you love him or is it just because all I want to be saved oh wait a minute redemption is a relationship redemption come brings you into a relationship with your Redeemer amen and what and it builds a relationship of love based on love it's the law oh yeah when you start because there he loved you he loved his seed that's why he did what he did it was his sons and his daughter study that he redeemed he come down to redeem and look what look at her oh yeah and he I'll do this I'll do this the pub as prophet of God said many others have said it listen he said God could have went when Adam and Eve fell and sinned he they could have waked it all off and wiped it off and started over again because before Adam and Eve as we said there was there was another culture and that's that's what that's what puzzles man today when he study in history and he's finding these these these creatures out there these animals and all that and finding this and they say this was man this was man so on yeah but it was a it was a it was a culture that God had and God created but God destroyed why because they all come under Satan's influence and you go into the book of Revelation it is the spirits that are that are in the end of waters and they're loosed oh yeah so God God destroyed it all because and the earth the Bible said in the beginning God created the heaven of the earth and and waters covered they covered the deep yeah but God came down her and it started over again and he brought in Adam and Eve but this time it was the manifestation of his plan amen manifestation of his predestinated will hallelujah his motive and his objective God at a rate motor and a right objective amen well god this or God that yeah brother sister Ava God is perfect and his motive was perfect and his objective was perfect a man and brother when we when we come into the relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ with God then brother we're going to have a right a perfect motive and a perfect objective hey man that brings us into a relationship with him that can't be broken amen praise the name of the Lord so brother sister what was your motive and your objective in the baptism of the Holy Ghost make sure you got it in your soul and not in your flesh you got to change from the inside out remember the problem God says he said God is threefold you're three full he said God is Father Son and Holy Ghost and he said you are soul spirit and body yeah and God God God works out of the soul to control of your spirit and through your spirit to control your flesh amen so brother we got to give preeminence to the anointing in the soul so that we're not going to give premise to the Satan's and ninety in our mind oh yeah Satan's and Satan's Nonnie in the flesh you'll say this this though this idea this thought and so on a man and then it goes on down to to your spirit but there if you're born again he comes in contact with with God with the Holy Ghost in May praise the Lord amen so if you're born again you're gonna they're gonna rebuke that spirit amen so you're gonna you're gonna believe God you're gonna believe by faith not by your intellect Amen so god help us brother that we're giving preeminence to the power and the anointing in our souls not in our flesh but there's too many believers brother they got that still controlled by their flesh sterile controlled by their thoughts their feelings yeah they're controlled by see taste feel smell and hear oh yeah that's the end things of your flesh or they're controlled by the instincts of their spirit imagination conscience memory Satan brings this to your remembrance God brings the word to your remembers to rebuke the devil yeah reason and it's what he did with Eve you got it a reason with him and affection oh yeah human affection fleshly affection feelings and all these things no but the soul is only governed by faith the revelation of the will of God amen what it's control what it controls your instincts of your spirit and it controls the instincts of your flesh to bring them subject to the instincts of the Holy Ghost God's instincts amen Oh brothers sister what is your motive and objective for the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you want it in your soul not just experience it in your flesh so I can do this and can do that and I can I can I can earlier you could be healed it's the prophecy give me the yield and go to hell yeah because why because you're mode of an objective is wrong why did you want to be healed he said what was your motive what was your objective it was just for their own sake oh I wanted this I wanted that but then he said you don't deserve evening know what's right motive for objective well I just want to be well know for the glory of God that's right and if and if not then the Lord not my will die and be done maybe it's God's will for me to experience this and be able to be a witness to the world via testimony to the world oh yeah god help us but help us to believe so brother sister what is your motive and objection for going to church well there's your motive and objective if you if you're into worship why are you worshiping he said the Holy Ghost and you you worshiping him because you love him you're worshiping him because you want to but you want to express your gratitude your thanks for what he's done for you and what he's doing for you you got to have a right motive and a right objective even in worship a man is not the expression of our feelings in your flesh no no it's based on Revelation it's based on Revelation hallelujah what he has done and what he's doing and and you know him and you love him and you want to worship Him a man if you love him and you want to worship Him oh yes that that's that's normal brother-sister humanly speaking what we're right there to praise the man off to praise this man to praise that person to praise this woman all because they're good they're good yeah what about God God nothing to match him not by any means I honor their praise one another dare to dare the hop left one another their had all to get them all wonderful wonderful word wonderful this and that no mind but how many are there - how many feel that way for Jesus not many too many Jesus is just it's a history that he did this and he did thank you Laurie so I I'm saved now thank you so I'll see you know if you really say you love him and you want to be with him and you want to stay with him for eternity and you want to worship Him it's like the prophet of God said he said I want to introduce you to Jesus and he said after I introduce you to Jesus he said I want to crawl up to his feet and worship you amazing grace you talk about a right motive and a right objective he said one time brother Brown said one time he said listen if he sends me to hell he said I'll still love him what brothers people today question the love of God because Oh God didn't do this God didn't give me this God didn't give me that old Lord I want this I need this and so on No he said oh if he sent me to hell I love you that's love that is absolutely love I minimus got that love for God grace so what is our motive and objective in our worship is it just religion is it emotion is it's just feeling or is it the anointing in your soul God Elvis so brother let's make our worship Shore with a right motive and a right objective what is your motive and objective for listening to the word and what is our mode of and objective for calling for the resurrection Wester why do you want to be resurrected is it because you love him so much you just can't wait to see him or is he just want to be saved most people is just I just want I just want to be safe thank you Lord for salvation yeah but what produced it yeah how did he do that why did he do that great start so what is our motive and objective in calling for the rapture just to get out of here yeah yeah but that's good do you want to get out well why do you want to get out what is your motive and objection for wanting to get out amen it's because you hate anything that's contrary to is righteousness amen god help us again I thought there was so little that we are else we could say regarding motive and objective but there's a lot because everything that God is looking for since the fall of man God's been testing man's motives and objectives God is still testing your motive and objective Amy you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost a right motive and a right objective amen the motive and the objective that Abel had the motive and the ejector that Abraham had what is the motive and of dear objective that Enoch had well he walked with God he walked with God his motive was right his objective was right yeah there's some serious quotes right there concerning motive and objective I share with you shortly amen so brother Noah what was his motive what was his objective do we have the mode of an objective that they had what was the motive that object the objective of the three Hebrew children putting their lives at risk didn't matter to them no there's not didn't mate didn't mean a thing to them they were they wanted to do it they gave the glory to God I'll share this they had it they had they loved God they had a right revelation of God amen and the word what about Daniel what was his motive his objective he he didn't hide when he went to pray he opened the drapes he opened the window whatever it was there he opened it all up and got down and prayed toward Jerusalem because God told him when you look to this place Psalms 121 you look to this place wherever a Jew went no matter where he went all he had to do was when he prayed he a certain hour he had do it and he would turn toward Jerusalem where he might have been miles and miles and miles away but he went toward Jerusalem because why he believed that the pillar fire-god was in the Ark of the Covenant in the temple in Jerusalem their motive was right your objective was right they honored God they respected God amen they loved the Lord ah no wonder Strait is the gate now it's the way and few there be that find it but most don't have a right motor and a right objective God's looking in your heart to see your motive and your objective and if you got the right motive and the right objective e is number one in your life he is the most important person in your life you will you're not going to compromise with anyone no no no you gonna put him first the prophet of God brings that out right here yeah so brother sister he said he said e knows the objective and the motive that we have in our hearts he said you can't do anything too little but what Jesus will see it no matter where it is what it is any little testimony or display of loyalty to Jesus he said he knows the very thoughts of the heart and the Bible said that he knew the sparrows fell into the street and we're so glad to know that every little thing that we do Jesus sees it amen and he said he will reward us he knows the objective in the motive we have in ours he says you got to forsake everything and you've got to make your choice now are you ready to forsake everything to follow him if God goes to putting a thirsty in your heart he said you'll forsake everything in the world listen to what he says he said I walked away from my own father and my own mother yeah at home he walked away and he said I got a wife and three children sitting right out here now and if they would tell me no more preaching he said I walk right away from home yes sir as much as I loved them died for them right here easily but Christ is all in all but this is the world that really they're not going to make that sacrifice with children no well well I love them yeah but love them with the divine love not a natural love you mean oh my god I pray God give us the love we should have for one another give mom and dad the Lord they should have for their children amen just saying he said I walk away if they if they didn't want me to preach I walk away oh yeah each is my objective Christ is my objective and my motive to him is to sacrifice everything that I have to follow him and whether I'm called a fanatic a divine healer a Holy Roller whatever it might be I don't care heesu for the things in the world I don't I don't believe any Christian does and he said we want to follow Christ and he said that's my objective follow him lift him up and that's what we need today is people willing to sacrifice people one time they follow Jesus like that they never allowed anything to come between them and Jesus whether it was family or friends or neighbors jobs no matter what it was they always put Jesus first but this is the this is the generation that compromises and they feel what God won't mind this God won't mind that that's the devil getting us to reason it is he said we are brethren and he said redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die he said that's right get love in your heart and be true and honest and have the right kind of a motive and the right kind of an objective and God will take care of the rest but you've got to have the right kind of a motive Holy Ghost motive Holy Ghost objective and God will take care of the rest if your objective is rate and your motives are right you know he said your objective is right and your motive is wrong it won't work won't work if you know it is the will of God then your motive right and your objective right and you must test your motive and your objective verse first he said find the will of God and then find your objective and then test your motive and see if your objective is right and he said then as Jesus said in mark 11 he said if you say to this mountain a man said be moved he said don't doubt in your heart but as long as you've got a doubt in your heart whether it's the will of God or your motive or objective is wrong how is it going to move he said but when you know that your motive is right and it's the will of God and your objective is right he said that mountain has got to move and it doesn't move because they're most their motive is not right their objective is not it's maybe a selfish reason but not for the glory of God it's got to be absolutely for the love of God and for the glory of God giving him the preeminence amen then the mountain will move a man he said now it's rough friend very rough I don't mean to be that myself but he said I hope you understand but today I am giving the expression of why I did the things that I have done and I want you to know that this has been my motive and my objective is God's Word my motive is to please him yeah no matter what you're doing no matter how you do it where are you doing when you do it is to please God again not my will my and be done no what I want to do for your glory amen and you're gonna do for his glory it's gonna be his will you got to do it do his will by the grace of God yeah he said my motive is to please him and I can't listen to everything and believe God's Word neither can I listen to everything and please God my motive is to know his word and to please God by serving him by his word not that I have anything against this or that but he says to please God not my will is will time is running out the Bible said as many as I as believed were baptized well I pray Heavenly Father that every one of us that raised their hands in true confession that the Word of God that they have read and seeing that they have been wrong I never looked at a for them he said it's not me for the look Lord it's you to look Lord he said you know the motive and the objective behind the hand that raised up a man as I said he emphasized motive an objective many many many times over the years he said Lord you know the motive and you know the objective behind the hand that raised up you know if you're gonna raise your hand in worship God sees your mold of an objective now what caused him to do that well he sees the heart so he said let them from this very our purpose in their heart from this day ends forth I'll take the word of God and the voice of God and follow it no matter what the price is a man I commit them to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ he said you must never look at things in the natural he's a look at spirit of anything you want to look at a city look at a spirit of it yeah just places that I've drove by or drove through and I didn't like the spirit of it there's a certain city or town Newfoundland that I've gone by many times but I know and right from teenage years I said Lord there's something wrong with this place I said I don't like the spirit of this place yeah all those years all those years and it's and I still feel the same thing when I Drive by that place yeah go towns other towns Oh something wrong here be in prayer yeah because the Bible warns us but even though going into a house there's there's house you're going to end and and they and they the right spirit is right and you can stay there but it's the spares not right you don't stay there the Bible tells you they say peace be to this house but it's just if they refuse it and then the spirit is wrong and opposed to it then you you leave it and go out yeah oh yes you imagine what the prophets felt what he desert when he was in travelling oh yeah grace he said you look at a family look at the spirits in the family look at a man look at the spirits in him see anything you look at everything has got to have a motive and objective amen yeah and the Spirit of God determines the motive and the objective you got yeah the church was put air for a purpose and there is a spirit behind this church certainly heesu spirit behind your home he said spirit behind every building he said behind everything there is a spirit there is a motive and an objective and if this church comes here to greatly exalts um human system each and his motive is not right if it's putty or to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God then the motive and the objective both is right but it's got to be for the kingdom of God as motovan objective was right in wanting to bring the profit light of this and another sermon he said his motive was right in wanting to bring the Ark of the Covenant he said back to Jerusalem but he said he didn't do it God's Way his motive and objective was right but he didn't do it God's Way he was supposed to consult the Prophet but he didn't he consulted man not only that he was supposed to put the Ark of the Covenant on the on the shoulders of the eye of the priesthood but he didn't do that he put it on new current God was working on David David's spiritual motives and objectives in his heart concerning doing it right what you do you might you might add Oh Lord this is what God wants me to do yeah but you got to do it the way God wants you to do it God wanted David to do that but he had to do it the way God wanted him to do it he didn't do it and there's things that we do sometimes and we do it God wants us to do it but we do it our way instead of doing the cards way you got to do it God's Way grace brother you're serious when it comes to motives and objectives it's serious well I just want to go to church because I want to be saved yeah you want to go to church because you want to worship the one that saved you amen you want to worship Jesus you want to go to church and worship Jesus because you love him amen oh I pray God help us to love him amen with all of our hearts let's have a motive of love an objective of love and fellowship with our Lord Jesus Christ amen and it's it's the motive and objectiveness that takes preeminence over all others in our lives by the grace of God amen never or Hebrews chapter 12 I didn't read a man verse 25 warnings and instructions thank God for the warnings and the instructions and the counsel he's given regarding motives and objectives I trust it'll get us to thinking they to get us to prayer there to get us really to be serious in the presence of the Lord Lord I want to consider my motives from my objectives out of my heart or what is my motive what is my objective nor I want it to be absolutely scriptural motive and objective I want my models and objectives Lord to be according to your will a man nor is not not just human feelings but a Holy Ghost nature and if you got the Holy Ghost nature it's going to produce the right motor but objective is going to produce a divine love oh my god Elvis divine law and I'll tell you it is such a difference between divine love and natural law Oh natural lovers up and down in and out you know but divine law it's the same yesterday today and forever a man and it's powerful yeah it's it's a it's a divine law they can cast out spirits oh yeah can heal the sick it not only saves our souls it's it's in a resurrection you see it's in the rapture divine love praise the Lord god is love God is divine love em and brother and divine law projected grace grace to save us to resurrect us to rapturous amen to bring us into into the presence of God into the presence of divine love just think that we're gonna go into the presence of love amen that's like there's there are those that we fellowship with years ago Oh fine or there are some it was just you know religion and just sometimes is the Holy Spirit but it was just fleshly in the flesh but not in the heart but yeah there was others we met that added in their souls or they were truly baptized with the Holy Ghost from the inside out they were dead oh they were new creatures in Christ in Christ not in the church not in the message in Christ new creatures and they had define love oh yeah they did and I know I know that there were stewards All Saints back there years ago dead oh that even denominational Christians love to go into their homes love to fellowship with them why because he said their love they got love yeah I was in one of those on one time and a clergy from another dinner from a denomination out there very formal denomination now and he was in that home and he loved it and he and he just he just couldn't he just didn't really want to leave but he said I got a pray now before I leave and he prayed oh yeah I need for any prayed for the brother and sister that are there on the home and lived there oh yeah and I noticed even children sometimes children would come in off the road into this house and sit down why because they like the atmosphere of love in that home they did well I've seen them yeah I said this is amazing I said thank the Lord yeah I pray God that that that brother sister is resting in peace yeah in the atmosphere of divine law in glory praise the Lord it's wonderful please don't take it for granted don't
