ask lord your grace to bless each one bring us lord and one spirit in unity and one accord we pray in jesus name amen amen amen lord bless you all if we can turn in your bibles we'll just have a reading of the word here in revelation chapter 13 thank you musicians they meant revelation 13 verse 1 and we'll just read down to verse 10. just to give us some some background here revelation 13 first one and i stood upon the sand of the sea and ice and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority this is certainly a beast and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death this is uh we touched a little bit on this this is uh rome here now and his deadly wound was healed this is pagan rome and and it was healed and became paper rome and all the world wandered after the beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and then that dwell in it in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints this is not us saints this is this happens after the rapture so it's talking about foolish virgins and to be overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the lamb lamb's book of life slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints amen may the lord as blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated at this time so we did cover a bit of hello we did cover a bit of this on wednesday so we got so far and this is kind of part two so i'm just going to run over the front of it again just to uh just to make sure that all of us kind of back up together as we go into the new part of it so we are looking at spirit warfare uh just having a view what's happening you know in the other realm and we know that there's great war taking place it's not uh we don't have much to do with it uh except it goes on in our heads in our minds and and those things and we're certainly under attack but it's between god and satan in this age is is the main main ones in the battle and much there is much confusion in the world today we see it it's just not uh uh it's just getting worse and worse as we see and it is a funny thing for generations because you see in your age in your generation what it's like and then you know the older you get you got more to compare but if you're growing up in this age you don't really see well this is the way it is it's always been they don't have much to compare with but you know the older you get you see how it was and how it is now and you can get to compare so you have two different kinds of views then of you know well it's not that bad really well you know uh it's it's just continually just getting worse all the time so there's much confusion in the world and there's uh we see just things breaking and things you know it's coming to an end and we know the the seventh seal has been revealed and once that's revealed uh things that uh that that are not part of the plan of god in this the final age things that don't that have an ending are going to end they're starting to end and he said first would be the uh the denominations the churches they would they would end and we were seeing that and we're seeing it just crumbling the crumbling apart with what they're starting to believe and turn to it's just just uh just outrageous you know in terms of the uh things that you know god has had set up in the beginning for his church we're certain to see that and it's just crumbling and we we know that it's come to an end because you know you don't see the the any uh you know during during you know the last many many years you see many churches and many denominations you know starting up and new denominations there's no such thing anymore you don't see hair of any major denomination anymore it's just it's come to it's come to an end that thing is not happening anymore and the nominations that have been are are ending so you're seeing it in the earth you've seen the changes the things that are happening you're seeing it in the family life you're staying in the business you're saying in the politics it's all just coming to an end you know we're just on a very fine line here when it comes to financial and they're just printing money you can see what's going on in the politics you know if you pay any attention to that it's just getting really really bad you know and uh you know there's just not a nation that's not you know in financial trouble right now you know and printing money is not the solution as we know we know all those things so so we see it and brandon saw it he's thought in seed form we're seeing reality coming now and it's really starting to happen and it's just different from you know generation seeing things getting worse this is really the end time so uh so we want to really kind of take a little closer look and see what's happening here from different angles there's many many angles but uh you know we as we said before we're in satan's eden and this is uh this is the time for us when satan is going to be given power for a short time upon the earth to really to finish things so uh so i just want to do uh like just a quick quick review uh you know in this world as uh bran did preach birth pains and and those things happening uh uh you know which we would see you know the earth you know just starting to go through these uh this uh delivery process where it's gonna be a new earth you know it's going through these birth pains and it will deliver a a new thing at the end so it's all the earth is part of god's plan and we in the seven seals you know it was part of it in the uh in the seals so it was in the mind of god and will continue those things that were in the mind of god in the in the beginning will continue so i'll just uh just have a quick run through run through this here and just see so we're not just going to go through the animation here we're just going to this with slides we saw last time i'll just flip to them fast so we talked about the times of the gentiles and uh that and we talked about uh you know what would be the beginning the end of this timeline and it was starting in daniel 2 with the with division that we saw of the four kingdoms and right up two and we talked about the abomination that make it desolation which was the mosque of omar and that would be the final end to the times of the gentiles when israel would then come to a power they don't have full power now they're still uh you know waiting for the bribe as we talked about to move out of the way and then the uh the jewish nation israel will come in and be a totally independent nation when they have that temple mount back and god will then deal with fully with israel he can't he he he's not now he's done things to get them gathered together and he had a long process as we know to do that and uh he he released those demons we talked about in order to bring israel into its homeland in in the second world war and uh and it was a time when uh there was just uh you know just uh you know just total confusion in in the world but god was had a plan and he was a plan to move those to open up israel again which hadn't happened since uh 70 a.d when they lost control of it under titus that time and the whole temple was destroyed and now they were back it was a major spiritual spiritual uh happening in the world which is forgotten now it's been a long time but the bride still remembers because it's a key point in the timeline of the end of the world and uh for sure at this time we were going to see israel taking place and then you know you know what israel i mean it's the same nothing happens unless they're in that land that god gave them you know that's their land you know and you see it with abraham as soon as he stepped off that land you know he you know that time it with egypt and he was down in egypt and the king there was going to take his wife from that and god said whoa you know i can't have this happen and he goes down and he has to straighten it up and like i said it's it's real it shows predestination because i have to have this woman here to deliver this and this all got to take place so god is very active he's not sitting back you know just waiting for all this to happen and let it happen itself he's engaged and he's doing these things so you see it and he wanted abraham back in that land get in you know around those borders inside those borders and he could deal with him he wouldn't even speak went in when he abraham went to egypt he didn't even speak to him he was speaking to the king there and he said tell abraham you know this this you know he had to so he wouldn't even speak to him so israel gets spoken to when they're inside those borders and he's gathering now for many years getting them into into israel and he is going to deal with him and he deals them as a nation we're dealt individually but he deals with israel as a nation so it will be all happening very it's in and it will be seen you know it'll be those things to be seen because it's more in the physical the the israel so at that time the bride is gone uh the the gentile powers come into full force and they and it goes through the three and a half years of tribulation while while the bride is in the marriage supper and then once all that's over the course the earth is burned over and cleared and then the it makes time for revelation 19 when the final battle happens and armageddon then the burning of the earth and then then it will be the millennium and it'll be the bride and the 144 000 at that time which we see in revelation chapter 7. okay so here we'll see the fullness of the gentiles well it happened from daniel right up to the time when israel was really up into revelation 11 and the mosque of omar is finished now we went through this and this is the four kingdoms that were depicted by the king nebuchadnezzar's dream that he had and he looked at all the the world powers and these would be the powers that will be in the in the earth and there'd be none others none of these kingdoms that god would be dealing with through these ages and we we know that three three of these have gone on and the fourth one was rome and uh it was the roman empire the pagan roman empire which had a great uh great control of the the earth at the time and and then it it was of course defeated it went under and what came up then was a spirit another spirit of that roman empire which was instead of pagan rome it was paper roman that's what we just read there when it was wounded unto death so we kind of covered a good bit of that and then in daniel's dream uh vision in in chapter seven uh he we talked here about the anointing that was on those kingdoms and each of them was represented by these uh creatures these beasts and they were ferocious beasts and we know that there's an accu always an accumulating effect so these beasts once they come the next one takes on the the attributes of the one before until in the final one the fourth one has the attributes of all the four beasts so it makes it more powerful more ferocious and that happens all the time we see it with the horse riders in revelation 4 that the white horse rider and the the red horse and the black horse all accumulate into this pale pale uh horse and this horse rider and that has all the powers of the previous one and it happens with the also in this age you know we know with justification you know we we go through justification brother brown says you know the the germ that we have started back before luther's time that's that's when it started it was four generations and he uses like when he's talking about levi and levi paid tithes back in abraham because his his germ was in abraham four generations back and he said it's the same spiritually so our germ really it starts back before luther's time and then that seed us in us accumulates then the the justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and we have all of that when when you come and are born again when you take on that spirit you already have justification all those built into it that's how it works it's accumulating thing that god does and it's uh it's amazing you know it's a great mystery uh revealed in this time but we need those uh four things and do it you know do you ever hear anyone talking about that i never heard anyone i was talking to uh when we were up uh friday and i was talking mr piggett and he was you know we were talking about justification you know he just couldn't get past justification wonderful thing yeah but you know that's that's that's just that's as much as they go you know there wasn't you know there is some sanctification but that's it you know and that's as far as they go they're just stopped in time you know and and i you know was talking you know going you know let's keep going here you know and it's just not there you know they're just talk different so so you know it's a great message as we know thank god for for it yeah and he he like i said before he passed billions of people to get to you guys to us you know amen uh so i just touched on the isms a bit and program was very uh uh you know uh he would get almost i don't know it was angry but he would certainly preach it that in his quote here he said communism ain't nothing it's a tool in the hands of god to bring revenge upon the earth for the blood of the saints it was never meant to be a power upon the earth like like one of the four powers in daniel was never meant to be that way even though we saw communism and fascism and nazisms all the isms and you know there's certainly a power you know you see it in russia and how it just you know just takes a whole lot of people and just destroys a nation you know just destroys a nation and you see it in the u.s you know you see it just uh happening there that spirit that's that's in there that's looking to take the to control the people large government take full control you know culver certainly gave us gave all of that leverage you know to the to the government's uh and it's a it's a communist spirit you know but it's not the one that will take over in the end but we know who will destroy the vatican and it probably said it in the end it will be russia and it will be because communism is a tool to revenge upon the earth for the blood of the saints right so he'll he'll still use it right up to the very end so not a thing that you know it's uh it's going to frighten us uh you know in that sense that it's going to be the dominating power it's not it'll always be rome the roman church and we mentioned it uh just shown here at the conversation on the top top of uh of the mountain when jesus was in a fast for 40 days and satan said and here and the devil said unto him all in the in the bowl of this power will i give thee and the glory of them for this is delivered unto me and and to whomsoever i will give it so he had control he's shown he's he had control of it here in this and you know he said and the glory of them so it was a glorious thing right you know to look at in the physical but as we looked at the anointings of these beasts upon these powers it was ferocious right it was to a goal that would just just destroy the people right and you saw it was wrong they had nothing you know they had nothing just living for nothing you know just working and paying taxes and being told what to do and their lands taken and you see see just such problems going on in the world with all of this and evil evil uh groups you know that try to control mexico for being one i mean it's just how much they just take control of everything you know uh here's the map and i was just shown there uh i meant to leave that one out but just shown where we were in in revelations what we're going to touch on but it's uh it's you know really uh it's just so good for the uh revelations just touches all the bible it's right from genesis you know right to jude you know it just covers so much in there you know because it all branches out from there and it's been open to us right it was never open before it was closed you know to john john didn't even understand it he was only saying well i saw this symbol and this symbol and this symbol he didn't know what it was he was saying he wasn't same with daniel he was there in chapter 12 saying you know i don't know what it is you know and uh so now it's it's all being revealed in this age to the bride you know that's it you know so it's uh it's uh just a blessing to see those things and understand those things that are happening right because it gives you uh the word being revealed that gives you faith right and you know so it's builds your faith so here is just uh now showing really of uh the uh church ages and the true church false church and what goes on at that time we know it's it's just you know a battle every bit of it much like you know bo john uh preached in with uh joshua you know you you you fought for every inch right and uh it's just not handed over to you and you're up against a lot of warfare spiritual warfare in this right and we see you know the chairman's over here and then the white horse riders the two anointings that are in our age going against the church church in the last age and we know that the uh cherubims were the ones set to protect uh the their guardians they're protecting the the way to the tree of life because someone is going to feed off that tree of life and it has to be protected right and there are powerful angels to protect god's promises there so moving on quickly is this quick enough here so we just read revelation and what we tried to show there is the same thing daniel saw in his vision in in daniel 7. he saw the same beast coming up and and then now john is seeing the same beast coming up uh oh you know i've seen this before oh so something's back here and it's going to be a present in the world it's going to be obvious now in the world and especially after the bride goes who especially after the bride goes then you know they'll see it on the last of the gentile kingdom in the last three and a half years when this when this uh beast rome and this anointing has power over over all the earth at that time and it will all eventually as we know end up going against israel and will come into the uh battle of armageddon which will be the final final uh show here in the earth i'm not going to spend too much time this fourth king was drawn into itself and the anointing is all the previous three kingdoms as i mentioned so not to go through these quotes but uh just uh just to show here i'm showing here to 200 000 000 demons that were released so quickly what happened is really uh as we know brother branham spends a lot of time explaining this that in this in the first world war that war ended quickly they didn't know really why it ended you know on november 11th uh in you know in on that time in the first world war the war ended suddenly and god took a halt to it because it was it was going it was going too far to what they wanted and what happened is that brother brown says because he it was it was starting to go into the sixth seal and the six seal program says cracked open and you see those seven angels in the four angels in revelation seven holding back the winds well that was starting to that was starting to let go you know as that's the thumbs funny but he he explains it all and he said it had to stop and it was called a halt and uh because because israel wasn't in their homeland and before revelation 7 it starts to uh be fulfilled they have to be in their homeland and we know they they never got into their homeland until the second world war right and these these were had to be released to get israel into uh get the jews back to israel the ones that he needed to be in there the 144 000 to be ready so he could go back and open open up to israel so so uh the war was stopped so technically the sixth seal opened it opened uh open then but it had to be halted and so anyway uh here in the second world war god gave permission to have these to satan to release these two hundred thousand thousand demons and you know you know what happened you know during the sequel war it was just horrific wasn't it i mean it was horrific what happened to the jews and everything and but they did get back into their homeland they were forced out of where they were because they did they were laid back they were just relaxed they they were wealthy they were doing really well and they weren't going to move you know it just wasn't going to happen so god forced that move to move them in in a horrific way and he moved them so that they did end up in israel and declared a nation in in 1948. so then in 1948 when they as soon as they declared then war was declared on them and five nations came against them the next day and they had nothing you know and the youth uh the us was very very uh a great ally to them and gave them uh arms and all of that and uh and they staved off you know egypt all those other nations in there and that was in america in itself and then it went to the five-day war and then the yom kippur war and they won every one of those and it was miraculous and then it's kind of forgotten then it just kind of forgotten because god is waiting and he's waiting on the bride that's that's what he's waiting for right now but then these these there's nowhere where it shows that these 200 000 demons were locked back up and you can see if you read it in chapter nine we don't have time but yeah in here in nine that's when they were released and loosed and god god permitted that so where's those 200 000 demons that were released i'm sure there was a lot of demons on the earth before they were released and these two hundred thousand but random sets are going to the bride you know they they're uh after the bride now right so that's why you know bertrand says you know you don't he says down here and you you don't it's not the same and and the spirit and the anointing and the prayer life and all of those things are hampered by these uh demons and just bringing pressure on the people right uh to to and it's the same as in the the jews were especially as we get closer to the end especially on the foolish virgins at that time i mean there would be just you know a terrific pressure on the people you know and how much before you know the bride will feel so much for sure and definitely more in some countries in other countries that's that's kind of typical but there will be pressure from these demons that are upon the earth now god is god is there the chairman the chairman is there to make sure that there's no harm you know comes there unless god permits it and satan can't do anything he had power he doesn't have any power upon the bride you know that doesn't happen you know so so unless god permits it you know god has to permit it and and amen showed us that's uh that's good for the bride so that was the idea that but it was an important important point is that kind of clear kind of clear so so berman said that the thing is that the sixth seal was cracked open and there were things that brother brown said in the six that were happening under the sixth seal that you kind of think oh i thought the bride had to be gone for the sixth seal so there's a couple of things that that explains so the last slide here we said the 200 000 demons have been released on the bride and the anointing of the white red and black uh uh horserider is saturating the churches and compromising the word and deceiving uh and they're being deceived on the word and the pale horse rider at this time the power for that that that that last writer will have had not been released god hasn't given full power you know of satan upon that horse rider to do what it has to do in the last days and the bride has to be gone for that because we see in in revelation 12 that the satan is kicked out of heaven when the bride goes up because they're accused of brethren right and he will not have the bride up there and him accusing the brethren while they're up there so him and his angels are sent to the earth and that's when that happens when a pale horse rider and all these are just symbolic will have their power laid the scene powers that are gathering in the churches in the world council of church to bring the harlot dollars into their completion so when rome rose first there was no protestant nation uh protestant denominations involved with this this is really under the protestant side to bring it all the christian religions in under rome at this time so that's what that is in revelation 13 they're going to turn themselves back under the agency of the pope again and so so that anointing is already in their land and that's called the ecumenical movement to bring all those denominations under and that's happening now we see it you can go in you you can go in to the world council of churches uh website and you see them all there you know they're all listed there you know i mean it's uh it's not hard to hard to see it and all this anointing and we battle every bit of it but we've been given power greater is he that is in you than he does in the world and if you notice with the lutheran church and the 500 the edicts how many was there 99 was it you know when luther put the edicts up you know they declared a little while ago that that's all cleared up or there's no more difference between us and the catholic church anymore right and that's not a good thing you know so all this anointing and we battle every bit of it but we've been given power greater is he that's in you that's he that's in the world right and uh we are in a warfare and you have to have the word you know the word is everything right the word in the beginning was the word and god god is the word and he there was a time when god wasn't god because there was no one to worship him you would know that right there was no one there to worship him so he wasn't god but he was the word he always was the word right amen so carrying carrying on this is the new stuff oh again no more time so i was asked a few people asked me about angels and the angels and i said things with different ages so i i'm gonna stick this in here this is this is sunday school now right so we're in sunday school here this is sunday school part so uh the angels you know the chairman's relate to the the tree a tree of life you know these are guardians so i'll just say just a couple of scriptures here and out of the ground i'm bet i'm better down here i think i feel so and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of not and the tree of knowledge of good and evil so that we we all know about the three the tree in the garden of eden in the beginning and the way would not be lost because god was going to promise some people you will eat of that tree you see that in revelation right in each age what is the tree of life there is only one source of life and that is jesus christ so the the tree of life is christ himself okay so we know that christ is the word you know so it's not jesus nazareth that was one one uh time when jesus was born when christ was born when a man was born of a woman and that was jesus of nazareth this is not jesus nazareth that was in the garden that came later right this is christ and this is the revelation of the seal this is the the message to what was revealed is that christ was in different forms in the word right up through and took form in in moses or or joseph right up to the old testament you know and came as as son of man in in as jesus nazareth in that time and then now back as christ the word in another office you know as the son of god in the church ages and then son of david and so he takes different forms but it's god right and the name of god is jesus christ ephesians 3 9. revelation 2 14 blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city that they may have right to to christ the word right the pattern of heaven is what is repeated on earth the old testament gives much of it in symbol right and we know that it's very much symbols but it does help in the new testament you know to see those to understand those symbols in revelation and revelation 22 1 2 this is the at the end here and he showed me a pure river of water of life claire's crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of this of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life right at the beginning right at the end tree of life right up through but beer which bare 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nation cherubs are the guardian to the throne in heaven so that's that's where you see him so i'll get into just the layers of angels there just shortly and they there are gardens at the gate in eden and the ark of the covenant and different things and i'll i'll get into that there there in a second they are there are guardians of the four gospels and that protect the book of acts and their guardians their guardians also of the word through the father ministry which brother brown deals with all are keeping the way and the goal don't lose the way to the tree of life that's the cherubim's goal right there i am the way the truth and the life amen ezekiel 1 1 how now now we're going to talk about cherubims in the old testament these cherubims and where they showed up now it came to pass in the 13th year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month very specific and i was among the captives by the river shabar remember that that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god this is ezekiel 1 1 how the book opens here and he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and the flaming sword which turned away turned every away to keep the way of the tree of life we just put that up and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire holding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of fire and brother brown said the color of god is amber and you see it you see it over here you know you'll see more like this here you know this i hope that's amber and thus you'll see you know in brother branham's ministry that that coloring also you know the same is what ezekiel saw and ezekiel was much like barbarian believe it or not and if you if you look at it the way he saw things and visions and the pillar fire and all of that you know there was a lot of similarities with tuta also out of the midst of thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the soul of the cat's foot and they sparkle like the color of burnished brass brass judgment so these you know this is the way they appear in a vision they're they're in it's a spirit right these are spirits these are angels they're anointings you know so and this is the way they appear to to ezekiel how he saw it you know so it's it's just like i said the new testament is very symbolic it uses a lot of symbols there now we are about to see this unfold now we are seeing a better picture of the cherubim that we had seen thus far so up to this point because you can see it in exodus there's a lot of references to cherubims when they were doing the tabernacle in the wilderness and they were on the curtains and all of these things but this is just more clarity here so let's just skip in a bunch if you're going to do cherubims you would go into exodus and those those uh chapters and the chair rooms were lifted up and this is the living creature that i saw by the river of chavarra so he's now pointing it back to chapter one here he's on chapter 10 now and he's he's shown that just the same one i saw before you know so you can kind of take that description that description and get more of a picture right ezekiel 10 and the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chabar and i knew that they were the cherubims everyone had four faces of peace and every one four wings and the likeness the hands of a man was under their wings and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of shabar their appearances and themselves they went everyone straight forward but mentions that you know with the gospels because they guided the gospels and they would go straight forward you know he mentions that in the quotes i don't have it here but he does the living creatures are cherubim they have four faces their wings are are without and touching each other two wings up they have two wings up and two wings cover they cover them they're down but they cover themselves with the wings they have four wings and their feet were straight feet and they sparkle like the color of burnished brass brass has always signifies judgment and and he and now we'll go over to revelation and it's describing uh christ in in the first chapter and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters people right water is always people so a judgment here again you know showing the likeness christ again now in this age as he is coming as a judge girded about the ways that the judge is girded and the brass has to do with judgments powerfully are and then cherubs and then the regular angels right although gabriel is the you know head of all the angels right so that's that's just what what i just conjured up so here's the one reference there to the seraphims in the year that king uzziah died from earlier scripture i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with two he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts and the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke so it kind of symbolic here in the mercy seat here in the ark of the covenant just a picture of it so i think that was it that's how just a kind of a brief brief uh view of uh cherubims so just clarify some things it was just some people just don't don't always kind of get it cleared there so i just did a bit of research on this hope it helps i hear it uh thought it was at the end but here you see uh pictures of angels here and of course the same one here on the things and so different different curtains and things if you go back and exodus describe different embroidery that's done on the curtains and things in the uh in the temple in the wilderness right and the ark of the covenant and et cetera et cetera so shown you know what what they saw in heaven is what was made here on earth so they could see the real the real ones were there up in heaven around the throne and things like that so that was the idea of it the chairman a two of them are embroidered under curtains in the tabernacle of the in the wilderness on the veil just before you go into the holy of holies here there are two large cherubim there embroidered under curtains you know and in exit and thou shalt make a veil of blue purple and scarlet and fine twined linen of cunning work with cherubims shall it be made and thou shall hang it upon four pillars of shooting wood overlay with gold their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver so a whole bunch of things in there around cherubims and that different things so do you so just a little bit more here from the new testament side of it and what brother brian said do you think that god don't put a guard around his words see if that oxlon man eagle isn't still sitting at those gates right here on earth right now here's the gospels the four gospels and you notice every every way they went they went straight forward that's the cherubims go straight forward right and they don't contradict one another they stay with one another one goes with the shrewdness of a man the other one goes with the swiftness of the eagle the other one's a pastor wanted one's evangelist to fly like evangelists that's kidri thinks and see the other ones pastors the other one's sturdy the other one shrewds he guarded on every side guard god guarding the holy ghost gospel believe it brother all right shown you know it's it's it's a it's a guardian right you know and it guards the five-fold ministry and they're different the five-fold ministry is different to each one has a different uh job to do in the in the in the body and they're they're all chained together it's a fold you know like here you fold like it's a you know it's folded five ways and it's but it's all together it's all one you know so you know it's used for the edification and the bride the body needs all of that just like you know it's like in nourishment it's all down in five you know protein and all and all of that you eat and it goes down into a chemical and helps your body right but you need all those chemicals and you need all these chemicals as well you know it's the same same concept you know that can't be just one right it's like you're eating carbs all the time you know or something you know you need those different things you need teachers you need evangelists you need those things for different needs right god dressed up in his church these offices and god's dress where when they see those officers pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's god's dress where god's presence god's spirit working through man right putting on the whole armor of god amen so that's so that's uh the cheer from sunday school now this is uh the second part of the sun this is sunday school today right so uh and i'm a sunday school teacher so so uh it's where i'm comfortable so in this this here we're just gonna just gonna run through a little bit of a church age uh things just to kind of show the what's happening in the church ages just a little bit just church ages in uh once you know the apostles really start going off the scene so you see dave pentecost then there was a period and the church ages never really started till brother bryan put it like 56 a.d or something so from say if if if you go at the day of pentecost being 33 a.d there's about 20 or 30 years in there where the apostles were working and things like that they started going off the scene of course and then john wasn't john was still here he died of natural death he was the only apostle did and he john when john went to the art of patmos and which was uh you know a pill colony and he saw the for two years the visions of revelation that were shown them paul was gone there and you know and there was a lot of them gone so right then it was the start of the church age so so and we're seeing how quickly things happen so if we want to turn we're going to turn for this one revelation two mighty my notes and just just read a bit of this and just just see the falling away that happened in here really quick and it was all planned of course we know that and just see how we do with this so revelation chapter 2 and verse 1 and this is the ephesian age the first age and we'll just read a little bit of this just to give us an idea here so just help you a little bit if you're doing your own reading too right so unto the angel of the church of the ephesus right these things saith he that holds the seven stars in his right hands who walked in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so that first line he's going back to chapter one and jesus has shown himself and he he he addresses all the seven ages with things from the first chapter he puts these in because he's going to be there in a certain capacity and he and he shows what kind of capacity he's going to be there in the in the in the first stage in the first chapter and he has he has different uh we know that the uh the ages was a portion of of the word you know each age and it was only in this age when the uh when all the ages came in together to the full word so at this point when john came off the whole thing was sealed and christ was there in the in the church and the cherubims you know there was this was the white the white horse rider was uh uh moving in this period but also the lion was there on the chair that that part of it was there to protect for three ages you know the saints that were in there and to protect and guard that path to the tree of life so he god was there in a portion he was there just in a attribute you know it wasn't the fullness it was just part and there were seven parts and all came together and we know it all came together because when brother brown saw that that that vision up here he and it and also in a couple of his visions he saw the seven seven coming the seven back together again they were all grouped together you know so he sort of knew the fullness was back together it was the full word but at that point like luther didn't have the full word you know and and he wasn't a prophet either you know so but in paul and and brother branham you know it was a prophet and it was it showed the full word was there right little uh introductory so so there's a uh he gets a a condemnation to every age except philadelphia to philadelphia he makes no criticism of the philadelphia age and and there is a commendation to every age except laodicea said nothing good about laodicea right christ didn't in his intros so christ was he was like i said he was displayed all through the old testament it wasn't jesus of nazareth in the old testament who was born of a woman when jesus nazar was born he was the same person as as the one in the old testament the life that was in it was the same person he wasn't another person it was all one person right through you know when he was here on earth when the old testament new testament it was the same same person he was revealed himself by measure as in moses and joseph was christ in measure and carried on until it came in the fullness of the godhead bodily and was manifested in jesus christ so verse 2 and i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst how thou canst not bear bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars so we're into the second verse here and and it's full of liars you know it's already infiltrated you know so you can see the spirit warfare that's going on and what they had to deal with so very quickly and paul paul warned of it and he said you know he said that uh you know that you know we'll be in infiltrated you know with with uh false apostles and things like that peter was also the same way all the apostles were warning that these times coming and you see it in the first age that that legalism really was starting to to come in and it was starting to creep into the church and and brother brown says watch actually sorry about that i got i got this up here i've done that before i had a whole whole uh presentation and i never got off the first slide and realized i had these and then only then did i click the button again so here's here's just what i was going through here so the second verse and legalism is is already starting to come in i just remembered that i had i had that up so brother brown says watch uh watch on all all the cults of of non-meat eating and a legalist that that says i got to do so and so if i don't speak with tongues if i don't do this if i don't shout if i don't dance there's something wrong with me that's legalism we are saved by grace through faith right so legalism you know it's yourself you know it's not getting yourself out of the way and letting christ come in you know it's you you know who's trying to organize this and keep all the score and everything like that you know and then oh what's that person over there doing and there is some you know how are all the other people doing you know compared to me and you know are they doing it right i'm doing it right but they're doing it wrong you know that kind of things that in the church and that could be a light you could have a lifetime of that in the church but you know there's usually a period of that there's there's some legalism that you look at yourself because you're trying to line yourself up and and i know lonnie jackson said that with legalism you know it's okay to use on yourself for a while but don't use it on other people you know you know you know he kind of needed a bit to you know in line get yourself lined up in the beginning you know but you realize that it's christ you know you have to get yourself out of the way it's not you it's not about me it's not about what plans i got i got no plan right you know i mean you can think of something and put it before god and and go with it but you know it's it's got to be according to the word right you know the word you know it can't be contradictory to word what your plans are you know because we're like children you know and the little children don't have this big plan you know in their life you know at an early age and that's all we are spiritually it is and you don't have to be by the word i remember a minister talking about uh it was someone who newly got came into the message and and they had dance had a dream that they were going to be baptized in the name of the father-son holy ghost that was a dream and she really believed it and when it came these guys these guys came into the message and they had to get re-baptized and and she she was all for cut the message but she wanted to get baptized that way because god had shown her that she was going to get baptized by the name of the father son holy olson you know that was false because it didn't line up with the word if it was it was an experience and we don't go by experience we go by the word right word takes preeminence over experience so so if not you you'll fall into legalism you know because you just keep a view of yourself so uh just got it in there uh nothing what you you've you've done it's what he did he did what you couldn't do if you could have saved yourself then he would have he would have had to die he wouldn't have had have had to die but he died in order to save you where you could not save yourself right so it's all about you you it was all about him not you so the whole thing is is there so just uh carry on here i know thy works in thy labor and my patience same verse so brother bryan is indicating that this is where legalism is starting to creep into the church when you can know by that to to mean that the church was it was never founded on legalism right because he's rebuking it and he's saying oh this you know uh we're starting to see this come in it wasn't there in the beginning so it's we're not built on legalism you know this one that says not not interceding for ignorance anymore he's interceding for his family so it now in this age you know he's he's he's uh he's still under throne you know uh brother brent says revelation 5 is wasn't an action chapter and uh he's he it comes a time when when there was he the blood covered for ignorance you know like in luther's day you know he said it was just a sprig that was out of the ground that's how much word they had and uh and and they and and he talks about here later a little bit but it talks about justification and and that they had nothing it was you know the beast had taken the whole thing away they had nothing everything was up for sale right you know the balances you know uh there you know they were weighing everything out you know you got to pay for this you know whatever you know prayer anything that god had freely given everything was paid for and we came right down to justification and and luther then who needed someone to take the revelation of that and get that back you know to be restored right before it was all gone there was nothing left you know so that that um so for the other things that with luther it was covered by the blood you know he had the holy ghost luther martin luther had the holy ghost john wesley had the holy ghost brother brown says but they were covered by the blood because just for ignorance because the full word was not revealed we're still into a partial word but now it's the full word and he's he's just not ignorance anymore right it's all revealed now it's all opened up but do we understand it all no we don't and we go by faith right but it is opened up it's all revealed you know he's interceding for his family right that's who he's his seed now he's he's uh uh that grace is starting to slip off here you know now starting to pull away from the earth and as the bride goes all of it goes right you know the less and less bride the less and less grace but we're you know he's he's still on the throne interceding for the bride of jesus christ his family but iran said that that he must continue in that office until the last name is brought in right once that's declared upon the earth that's it it's over right and thou has tried them which say they are apostles he's commending the church that they're still willing to to back and try spirits according to the word not by experience but by word brother brown said away with the experience as your measuring line right we just covered that right so it's not experienced so word is the measuring line word the word is god the word is christ and that comes first and thou has tried them that say they are apostles and they're not and has found them liars you see this is the ephesians church right i mean this is uh this is the best church here best church age right brother brenham and we see it here you know like there's there's darkness and light here you know right up to here where there's really no really in essence no light at all you know so brother brown said the the way that they did it was they they would judge them by the by what paul taught that's our measuring line today we believe with the message we have that anyone that teaches contrary to that message is not teaching what paul taught right this message that came to us is the restoration of paul's teaching completely sealed in john's days unsealed in this day liars showing that deception in the church right so we we you know brother brown says you know uh you know when he was in beyond the curtain of time and they said uh you know in his uh vision and he said you know well he taught what palti and and and then he heard the response you know we're counting on that right so that was uh that's what we do today with you know there's nothing blurred right added nothing new to the word he can't right you know it was ordained and thou has found them liars he's he's commending the age you have cut liars in your midst and you're you've identified them and you were right well done and this is uh it's actually actively operating through the church because he didn't send a prophet in to say you know in that age they didn't have a prophet and to say you know to discern said this one's wrong and that one is a liar and this one he's a jew and he's really not and god didn't need to do that because the bride had the discernment of spirit within her you know that was different in that age right and by her life she's proving that she can in an active manifestation of what he said he would be in chapter one and that exists today for the bride right we still have that through all of the ages is is the spirit in the bride it's him and the bride who's doing these things and not necessarily a separate prophet right when they saw you know things like the jews coming in and say well we have this and this so we're above uh you know the gentiles and all those kinds of things that was going on in the church ages so i'm just i'm just going through a couple of verses there just kind of give you an idea of the condition of that church and in in verse 3 here it says and and and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted these are difficult times you know being described right he says for my sake and so you're taking a stand for for true christian baptism and in in future ages he'll come up and he'll come up and say you know in the future ages you have a name for which you think you're saved but you're dead by that time the trinity has taken over in the future ages right so there's nothing left of the name or the the baptism as we know it today it doesn't get restored until the end that baptizing in those titles of father son and holy ghost but here's the ephesian church age that for my name's sake has labor in it and has not fainted so you know in this age in that age it was it was good they kept up the the name nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love right in verse four thou already you know in in the early age you know just leaving their first love now this is the age where they began to lose their first love and he's noticing its works and labors is coming in right it's legalism brother brandon points to legalism creeping in and we find out by our human nature that that we easily fall into legalism it's human nature to keep a scorecard of your life we have to continue to be reminded of the grace of almighty god and that's the natural way we are and we have to fight that today you know is those things right we have to get out of the way it's not about us right you know it's the word you know and you know the word has been given paul peter and jesus spent a lot of time talking about the grace that comes from god they were beginning to relax the standards of what the new birth meant and what it would would take to receive the new birth paul's doctrine is already starting to creep in individuals are already starting to make more out of themselves and you get kingdom builders already rising up people saying you can't listen to john this is the spirit warfare right that's going on in the ages right that's happening peter had to face ananias and sapphira simon faces the sorcerer who had all this influence amongst the people and paul was constantly constantly battle against the judiciary judas jew desire right and you see that in galatians there you know he speaks to them paul calleth called it after that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock in acts holy the holy spirit interprets i get that the holy spirit interprets it in john's prophecy that you're going to leave your first love you're going to start having legalism coming and you're going to be all about works right and of course that's that's the problem world today is works right the whole thing is works it's gone over the works right you know when you meet people and like well you know i did this and this if that's not good enough for god well why they'll try my best you know that's the way it is right you know i got i got to i got to do it right and if that's not good enough well what am i going to do and you you really used to see that in the catholic church it was all works but now it's it's just you know every you you notice it was talking to other people nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first law of still on that thy tire that's all they got left was works they had nothing left by the time the fourth age came with the red horse rider the age is so dark i i won't even put everything else upon you he said in the in that age the catholic church had turned into wax candles purgatory praying to saints rosary beads virgin mary et cetera right the whole thing was corrupt we know that luther has given the command to get a hold of that last element that the just shall live in christ by his faith strength that which is about to die right that has never been threatened again since the dark ages because that's what all protestants establish on soul once god gave that that was it that that was in there he'll never take it back and justification is there i know i heard about it friday it's still there you know that's established you know that that will never change right god complaining to the church you're falling away from the purpose of my dying you're falling away from grace you're falling away from the fact that i love you your f you're trying to serve me by works and you'll never do it israel couldn't do it i only gave them the law to prove that they couldn't do keep it man cannot live by bread alone right you know amen they need him they need the spirit right spoken word is your original seed now for the birth of the word is christ not of polluted not of polluted with denominations the early church no denominations just the word and the spirit irrigated god laid the word down like that and the holy spirit irrigated it and there she went she brought forth children certainly amen so denominations you know is is when man's ideas come in right when it's no longer the pure word as soon as man ideas come in then it goes to a denomination and the spirit moves away you know and usually it's just five years that's kind of what the number they kind of give it to it doesn't take long before they organize and to get everything organized but brother bram says it's logical but you cannot come up with your own and the accompli all it is is compromise because you may have you end up with two two different ideas and they got a compromise right and you know they got two ways of looking at the word and what that means and ends up with your own right so it's very easy to fall into that but the church can't do it she's too denominate too denominated she can't do it she's got the world mixed up with her right and we definitely see that today in this you know last age right anytime you allow the world to be mixed with your fate you become sterile and cannot produce the life of krait it affects effectively hinders you right and this is what happened in the ages right from the beginning and you see the decline here you know you see with the light going right all the time right so it's uh it's a good view of all of it oh a little bit one more he that heads in here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall be hurt of the second death if we keep the flus cleaned out and keep your heart pure then god in you is able to handle anything you can face we have to have the sword with two edges because that's the only thing that will stop a devil that's going to stop the devil from taking your home your family your marriage your finances and your health right that's that's that's the only thing you got are rewarded in the last day is what we'll be granted to that we'll be granted to eat of the tree of life and have a crown and be seated with christ if you're a believer today you've already overcome we have already understood and overcome and the only thing that we're going that we're doing here is daily allowing christ to live more and more in our lives end time evangelism the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture what can it do according to malachi 4 to bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the pentecostal part in the restoration time i will restore saith the lord that's real event end time evangelism amen that's it we're at the end we've seen and accepted the last sign to the gentile right that's how late late we are right just a couple of quotes here on brother brown said about the sign at the end right and he said she run into the city we know who that is at the woman at the well in in john 4 and said come see a man see a man told me that i've done isn't that the very messiah if that was the sign of the messiah to the jew and to the samaritan he is no respecter of persons the same yesterday today and forever and that was the ending when god stopped dealing with jews and samaritans and this is the end end of the gentile dispensation when he has come up through reformers and so forth to the end and promised as it was in the days of abraham so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed to the gentiles in the last day he would return again amen now look i want to ask something what what he does i'm cutting off here just today jamming too much in what if he does come tonight oh say he isn't coming i don't know whether he is or not this is the last sign remember thus say it to the lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you are seeing you're seeing your last sign it's brother i'm standing up there in the meeting and he's saying you're seeing your last sign right here that's scriptural you've seen your last sign pentecost don't get mixed up now with what he promised israel after the rapture that he that ain't you you're done then now is your day now is your sign now is your time don't reject it don't do it you've better come you'd better come you believe me to be god's servant remember so that was the last there's no sign there was no sign after that you were not looking for anything right the next thing is the coming of the lords the manifestation of the sons of god and the coming of the lord right now we pentecost people who claim to kiss the rim of the golden blessings of the cup of god how can we stand still and see the holy spirit moving around us christ himself with his word proving that he's here and then just sit still and say well i wish there's something i wish that something would take place he could do no more and remember i'm telling you in the name of the lord if you believe me to be his servant in the name of the lord you'll see no greater sign than you're seeing now you'll never see it now you mark it down in your bible if you do then you call me up if you see another sign you're seeing your last thing just remember the church is going it's going into layadicia just where she's at now amen so we're we're we've seen our last sign the sign of the and it was god's mercy to us you know it it could uh you know it could have went and ended and no profit and we could have just slipped right off into the abyss right and you'd never known you never know what happened you're going to be like the rest of the world right and you know if it's not the family of god you'll never you'll never understand it you'll never see it you know unless that seed is in there to quicken right and god to show you it because it shows that it's all god there's nothing nothing else in there but god and and unless we unless you know you're uh focused in this day and giving it preeminence you know you're just gonna and if you're just casually taking it and taking it you know on a wednesday and sunday it's just not the way it works you have to be into the world everyone is busy and all that happens but you know we just have to be you know on our toes because you see the warfare that's going on there you see the the uh enemy you know and and what is stacked up against you and it's only the grace of god that you know that that those things aren't uh penetrating you know and coming into your life more and more and it says the grace of god that just keeps you you know with your head above water really because this whole thing is going under you know we know it right we've seen it so many times you know when you see just families just disintegrating and and businesses and governments and everything you know just just fall
