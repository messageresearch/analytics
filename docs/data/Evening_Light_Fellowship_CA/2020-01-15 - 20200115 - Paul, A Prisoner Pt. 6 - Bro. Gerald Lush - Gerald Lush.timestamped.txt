[54:19] [Music]
[54:31] they by the grace of God be with us Lord
[54:35] bless you turn with me to the Book of
[54:37] Isaiah chapter 12
[54:40] it's another there's another scripture I
[54:42] want to get into we will as we go to the
[54:46] words but I should have grace to pray
[54:50] for the service on Sunday a man we say
[54:55] Lord willing the weather permitting well
[54:58] as I say the way if the Lord is willing
[55:00] the winner will be ready a man he's in
[55:03] control but I want you to pray for the
[55:06] grace of God that we are able to have
[55:08] the communion service on Sunday a man
[55:11] I've been wanting to have it because of
[55:14] the the weather that we cancel it a
[55:18] couple of times and I never said
[55:19] anything about it but so we pray the
[55:22] grace I was going to have it last Sunday
[55:24] and I just know was it because of the
[55:27] weather and the forecast so we pray the
[55:29] grace of God that we'll see what this
[55:32] Sunday will hold the madness the Lord
[55:34] leads for the communion and the foot
[55:37] washing he said again like you know I
[55:39] remind you you heard me say it many
[55:41] times where the prophet of God I think
[55:44] they told that brother from Africa and
[55:47] he said there other he said maybe the
[55:49] Presbyterians are better than we are and
[55:52] I guess the brother was wondering why
[55:54] considering the revelation the word the
[55:56] problem of God was pretty and he said
[55:59] well he said they haven't even every
[56:01] Sunday and he said we only have it once
[56:03] a month and so he said maybe they're
[56:06] better than we're so we pray the grace
[56:08] is God out but because the Bible does
[56:10] say as oft as she do it she didn't say
[56:14] is - he didn't tell us that it was along
[56:15] he didn't tell us to do once a week but
[56:18] he said as oft as you do it do it in
[56:19] remembrance of me so god help us is my
[56:22] prayer amen in isaiah chapter 12 and
[56:27] again be in prayers of the saints and i
[56:31] guess a number that is missing tonight
[56:33] and the lord bless them where they are
[56:36] amen
[56:38] in Isaiah chapter 12 and the antigens
[56:41] the first six verses and it says in that
[56:45] day thou shalt say O Lord I will praise
[56:49] thee though thou was angry with me dine
[56:54] anger is turned away it's all because of
[56:57] Calvary and thou comforted me the old
[57:01] god is my salvation i will trust and not
[57:06] be afraid
[57:07] a man god help us he said for the lord
[57:11] jehovah is my strength and my song he
[57:16] also had become my salvation praise the
[57:20] Lord
[57:21] therefore with joy shall he draw water
[57:25] out of the wells of salvation a man
[57:29] praise the Lord
[57:30] that's what we're doing with the
[57:33] revealed word there will be joy shall he
[57:36] draw water out of the wells of salvation
[57:39] and in that day shall he say praise the
[57:45] Lord call upon anything declare his
[57:49] doings among the people make mention
[57:52] that his name is exalted praise the Lord
[57:56] sing unto the Lord for he has done
[58:01] excellent things this is known in all
[58:05] the earth and it says cry out and shout
[58:08] thou inhabitant of Zion for great is the
[58:13] Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee
[58:17] amen thank God for the revelation of our
[58:21] Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[58:27] so the Lord when there's some thoughts
[58:29] that I want to share with you discern
[58:31] any subdeacon being a prisoner of the
[58:35] word what I want to share with you a
[58:38] quote that I majored in with you during
[58:40] the last service but just reminding us I
[58:44] feel that it's important that we not
[58:47] forget it I feel that it's important
[58:49] because we're going to need
[58:51] especially the clumps are closer to the
[58:54] resurrection and the rapture and as the
[58:57] world gets more and more control the
[59:00] devil good remembering again the saint
[59:03] is the god of this world he's not Jesus
[59:05] he's the god of the bride
[59:07] he's the god of the elect he's the god
[59:10] of his of his predestinated seat and
[59:12] they're and they're fewer and fewer if
[59:15] you remember we have come down now to
[59:17] the full manifestation of the wise
[59:20] virgins and authorities virgins a man
[59:23] it is the wise virgins a man that are
[59:25] going into the resurrection and the
[59:28] rapture as the right of the Lord Jesus
[59:30] Christ but it is the foolish virgins a
[59:33] man who are going into the Great
[59:35] Tribulation and they lay down their
[59:37] lives a man for of the word and the
[59:40] problem of God again I like to
[59:42] understand he said that they are virgins
[59:45] he said they are foolish me that they
[59:48] don't have the wisdom of the wise
[59:51] virgins so they're considered as the
[59:54] word maybe in the hands of God you're
[59:56] foolish and they deem an anointing of
[59:59] the Holy Ghost that is needed to take us
[1:00:02] out of time and into eternity they're
[1:00:04] lacking that Ananya of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:06] that takes us into the real word that
[1:00:08] gives us resurrection and reference
[1:00:10] faith by the grace of God so there's a
[1:00:15] brother already wrote me one time not
[1:00:18] long ago he's rather journal he said
[1:00:20] well he said there be anything why are
[1:00:23] foolish virgins he said around the
[1:00:26] message and I said yes brother I said
[1:00:29] they're not on the end of the air I said
[1:00:31] there's going to be those that are even
[1:00:32] around the message they're the icer
[1:00:34] there there's virgins at every age all
[1:00:38] the way down through foolish virgins and
[1:00:40] wise versus foolish and wise a man and I
[1:00:44] said what I said the thing of it is I
[1:00:46] bet the foolish virgins are going to
[1:00:48] come forward but I said those in the
[1:00:50] last States are going to lay down their
[1:00:51] lives and the Great Tribulation and some
[1:00:54] of them will no doubt eyes will be
[1:00:56] identified in the message
[1:00:57] they'll identify with the message maybe
[1:00:59] some professors say well I'm in believe
[1:01:02] there's a
[1:01:03] - you a man just a while concerning will
[1:01:07] are you really really really a believer
[1:01:10] a man of God said you believe in your
[1:01:14] head but only in your heart a man so
[1:01:18] maybe the problem was referring then to
[1:01:20] foolish virgins knowing that fewer and
[1:01:25] fewer and fewer a man so that when the
[1:01:29] rapture takes place and the dead in
[1:01:31] Christ rise first we which are alive and
[1:01:33] remain are going to come up with those
[1:01:36] new that are resurrected and we're going
[1:01:38] to go to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:01:41] shall we ever be with the Lord but again
[1:01:44] with it when that happens there is going
[1:01:47] to be very very shoe so few that the
[1:01:50] world won't know where you're not so few
[1:01:52] that the world will know that the
[1:01:54] rapture took place they got you know
[1:01:56] that the Bible tells us there's going to
[1:01:58] be a generation I thought there was
[1:02:01] they're going to see the world in a man
[1:02:51] price sanctifying grace the gifts of the
[1:02:59] Spirit a man by the grace of God in
[1:03:02] Revelation in their faith day then they
[1:03:05] got a man focus on the gifts focus on
[1:03:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:03:12] but the faith that God is giving this
[1:03:14] generation is focusing on the
[1:03:16] resurrection and the rapture brother I
[1:03:19] pray God and a goddess don't believe God
[1:03:21] for it
[1:03:22] brother all the father gives me will
[1:03:25] come to me and I will lose none a man
[1:03:28] says what you say so brother it although
[1:03:31] when it comes to the bride when it comes
[1:03:33] to the elect of God all down through the
[1:03:35] ages every one of them thank God Jesus
[1:03:37] is going to be there in every age right
[1:03:40] now from the first age right on to this
[1:03:43] last age a man but again God my
[1:03:46] destination came to Jesus God by
[1:03:49] predestination 14 them for the
[1:03:51] resurrection and the rapture right into
[1:03:54] the last age a man but the thing that is
[1:03:57] happening anyway better predestinated
[1:03:59] alot in other ages but in the last stage
[1:04:02] in the bride age he has been not many
[1:04:05] predestinated to the master when it
[1:04:07] comes to the living Saints but I believe
[1:04:10] that both of them are gone on they made
[1:04:13] by the grace of God and the Father God
[1:04:16] also warned our brother told our brother
[1:04:18] me male they the older generation around
[1:04:21] the message would go on they would go
[1:04:24] back we worry because they would not
[1:04:27] easily they were judges women whether
[1:04:31] they even do the - to recognize it
[1:04:33] except that no they weren't already
[1:04:35] they were predestinated for it but there
[1:04:37] is a generation there is brothers and
[1:04:40] sisters a in the world today that are
[1:04:42] predestinated unto the resurrection and
[1:04:45] the rapture that a man economy may be
[1:04:48] that a reality in their hearts and in
[1:04:50] their souls a man Lord God have mercy my
[1:04:57] heart my soul with with a faith oh my
[1:05:00] brother my son can't you really believe

[1:05:29] feelings no remembers have seen nothing
[1:05:32] but it's going to be an absolutely
[1:05:34] perfect Kingdom and absolutely perfect
[1:05:37] world that we're going to a man so God
[1:05:40] comes to me can you really believe that
[1:05:42] there is such a Kingdom
[1:05:44] can you really believe that there is
[1:05:45] such a world that you're living in this
[1:05:48] world you're experiencing this you're
[1:05:49] experiencing that and you see this you
[1:05:51] feel this you are you you you're
[1:05:53] thinking these thoughts a man but
[1:05:56] brother my son got to do through the
[1:05:59] review words for the preaching of the
[1:06:00] ministry today God is trying to get to
[1:06:03] the right a man away from this world and
[1:06:05] more conscious of the world to come away
[1:06:08] well this word on the more conscious of
[1:06:10] the kingdom of God away a brother sister
[1:06:13] from what we're feeling and thinking in
[1:06:16] this in this body are my natural rights
[1:06:19] brother he's trying to get us to be more
[1:06:21] and more and more spiritual a man he's
[1:06:24] trying to get us a brother they add the
[1:06:26] pain hey man brother Kenny when they
[1:06:30] were the prisoners of the revelation out
[1:06:32] of Egypt but they're also prisoners to
[1:06:35] the revelation into the Promised Land
[1:06:37] amen others were similar but when
[1:06:41] they're not challenged them about
[1:06:43] getting it oh no no no no just think
[1:06:47] where was their faith joseline hater
[1:06:50] wanna go in and all that came out of
[1:06:53] Egypt there's only true then they wanted
[1:06:55] to go in how the denomination how many
[1:06:58] really want to go into the resurrection
[1:07:00] how many really want to get into the
[1:07:02] rapture I mean are they really real in
[1:07:06] our heart that we have a real truly
[1:07:08] truly rather revelation already register
[1:07:12] do we really believe it hey do we really
[1:07:14] believe the rats were never there
[1:07:17] yes God is big enough concerning the
[1:07:21] resurrection nobody on Oscar Zoroaster
[1:07:24] or my brother so we gotta have a
[1:07:27] revelation it's gotta be really with us
[1:07:29] as it was to Jesus because Jesus mother
[1:07:32] agency said I am the resurrection when
[1:07:35] he's trillion student even if you were
[1:07:37] the tomb of Lazarus
[1:07:38] oh he's gonna rise again oh yeah you're

[1:07:45] buddy buddies and I am the resurrection
[1:07:47] and the life he that liveth and
[1:07:50] believeth in me shall never die
[1:07:51] and though he were dead yet shall he
[1:07:53] live Amen praise the Lord
[1:07:55] oh brother what a revelation that he had
[1:07:58] and brother in control me morning noon
[1:08:00] and night and controlled everything that
[1:08:02] he was doing and thinking his whole life
[1:08:05] was wrapped around the revelation of
[1:08:07] resurrection rapture hey he knew that he
[1:08:11] had come to that Chinese place he knew
[1:08:13] he had come to that time in his ministry
[1:08:16] brother brother sister and we ought to
[1:08:18] know now we have come to that hour
[1:08:20] either for the resurrection and the
[1:08:22] rapture father consumer concerning the
[1:08:24] message of the hour
[1:08:25] concerning is whether what God has done
[1:08:27] what God is doing brother told my
[1:08:30] brother sister god help us from the name
[1:08:33] of Jesus even a man mother katakana
[1:08:38] young economy young me what's going on
[1:08:40] you for what we're leaving for he's
[1:08:43] waiting on us because why because he has
[1:08:45] given us a revelation of the
[1:08:47] resurrection he's given us the
[1:08:49] revelation to register now that's why I
[1:08:51] got a trainee on us the dead in Christ
[1:08:54] or not a man or guns with a reasonably
[1:08:58] group of real oh yeah I get a letter to
[1:09:03] God in you it's going to Christ in you
[1:09:06] and Jesus said I am the resurrection and
[1:09:08] a decent life and so by now brother
[1:09:12] concerning what God has done in this are
[1:09:14] concerning the word that God has given
[1:09:16] us concerning the message that God has
[1:09:18] given us it ought to give us that
[1:09:20] revelation brother that that God is
[1:09:22] looking for in this thing that I
[1:09:24] direction I am that I will be I am
[1:09:29] because why because he came down in the
[1:09:32] Ministry of a prophet a man it was my
[1:09:35] name was a freedom rider who was Jesus
[1:09:37] and the prophet of God said now I can't
[1:09:39] do this he said he said I got to get out
[1:09:41] of the way so he can do it a man he got
[1:09:44] in the way of ruling brother Branham it
[1:09:47] was nice
[1:09:48] amen it was Jesus controlling with it
[1:09:51] random
[1:09:52] it's Jesus controlling you a man is
[1:09:55] jesus controlling me by the grace of God
[1:09:58] a man looking down to the natural bunch
[1:10:01] of the spiritual brother we're not
[1:10:03] living out of the natural plane
[1:10:05] we're not living about our natural
[1:10:07] things we're living by our faith a man
[1:10:10] is like knowledge through us what God
[1:10:12] has given us and what God has made real
[1:10:14] in our hearts and in our souls pain
[1:10:17] right and the public gods and those who
[1:10:19] are faith declares is more real than
[1:10:21] when our sensors declare but is most
[1:10:24] believers name
[1:10:25] therefore caught up with their secondary
[1:10:28] faint and it's an absolute truth because
[1:10:33] I knew that because there didn't happen
[1:10:36] by the natural people might more than
[1:10:38] they are the spiritual a man they're
[1:10:41] going war led by that and when it comes
[1:10:43] to why morning noon and night magazine
[1:10:46] or supper and my job and I got to do
[1:10:49] this what we gotta do is Virgil a man do
[1:10:56] the rest if the Lord willing a man the
[1:10:59] Lord will argue or do you want to do
[1:11:01] that I'm gonna follow his leadership a
[1:11:03] man not too intelligent and clothes not
[1:11:06] leadership and aggravating go by their
[1:11:09] senses now all they all the rest is
[1:11:12] ruined by their senses amen they went
[1:11:15] into the Promised Land
[1:11:16] whoever they saw it was exactly as Mark
[1:11:19] said it would be exactly a jarring
[1:11:22] handily
[1:11:23] a man but they loved the natural things
[1:11:26] to override their spiritual thing a man
[1:11:29] because they were looking at the big the
[1:11:32] big cities they were looking at that
[1:11:34] the drains in the land they're looking
[1:11:36] at all the soldiers in the land oh no no
[1:11:40] we can't do it what after all that after
[1:11:43] all that you overcome in Egypt after all
[1:11:46] that you overcome there and Carl Rogers
[1:11:48] have a name no wonder that God need a
[1:11:51] boy brought him out of Egypt he over the
[1:11:54] Red Sea and he give the victory here
[1:11:57] amen oh yeah even with the enemy was
[1:11:59] behind them anyway the pillar fire that
[1:12:02] was in front of the GED the Jews in
[1:12:06] front of the a lion and that Moses that
[1:12:09] had all these rights amen the pillar
[1:12:12] fighter was there and they were
[1:12:13] following that light the pillar for
[1:12:15] would be lead them a blend of the enemy
[1:12:17] amen oh brother sister so that what we
[1:12:21] have got is just am so with a God opened
[1:12:25] the Red Sea and they went across from
[1:12:27] the Red Sea amen
[1:12:28] then the pillar fire went with them hey
[1:12:30] man and even when the enemy tried to
[1:12:32] follow them they don't around that's
[1:12:35] right they all drowned brother sister
[1:12:37] the grace of God be with us to have us
[1:12:39] that we're not going to go by our senses
[1:12:42] we're not going to go by way by by the
[1:12:44] enemy I'm going to go by by all those
[1:12:46] that are caught with there were all the
[1:12:47] things of the world now we're going to
[1:12:49] go by what God has revealed to us in his
[1:12:51] word and as far as his son he said it is
[1:12:55] the resurrection rapture reallyyou is
[1:12:57] the kingdom of God really more you do
[1:13:00] you spiritual things that I have
[1:13:05] revealed concerning the kingdom of God a
[1:13:07] man and then the eternal dimension is a
[1:13:11] more real deal than the dimension you're
[1:13:13] living in right under this - the problem
[1:13:17] with war leader Joshua Caleb they need
[1:13:20] the Egyptian Egypt Akana
[1:13:22] hey why because this was the promise of
[1:13:26] God
[1:13:26] praise the Lord this was the promise of
[1:13:29] God and he said they're going to be in
[1:13:31] Egypt and he said in bondage for over
[1:13:34] 400 years
[1:13:35] and around 400 years with his Florida 30
[1:13:37] or a hoarder 33 because of their
[1:13:40] unbelief
[1:13:40] that's right Godsey waiting for their
[1:13:43] cry yeah well why didn't God God told
[1:13:48] years but yeah but he's waited for the
[1:13:50] hear them crying he had a nickel on God
[1:13:53] asking you and you'll receive CQ
[1:13:56] pinnock will be open and read on the
[1:13:59] finally God said to Moses I've heard the
[1:14:01] cry of my people I come to deliver them
[1:14:03] amen but they let it go on for hundred
[1:14:06] years and they go on for another thirty
[1:14:08] four thirty years
[1:14:09] amen and that our God finally cried and
[1:14:13] God came down today and brother
[1:14:16] concerning you think after all that the
[1:14:18] signs wonders ministry that Moses said
[1:14:20] the signs and wonders Ministry of Joshua
[1:14:23] oh I believe I believe I believe yeah
[1:14:26] yeah got an approve that belief where
[1:14:30] there's into little or spiritual in a
[1:14:33] brother and the same thing there's power
[1:14:35] when when God's people was any in
[1:14:37] denominational bondage and God by the
[1:14:41] grace of God God promised he's going to
[1:14:42] deliver us I will restore say the Lord a
[1:14:46] man God wants to do this God promised to
[1:14:48] do that and he came down in the ministry
[1:14:51] amen like it was losers the ministry
[1:14:54] that was revealed in our Lord Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ amen
[1:14:57] anything with that ministry brother I'd
[1:14:59] say brother not naturally Luther's there
[1:15:01] Wesley there or even there are meta
[1:15:04] consoles but in this latter day why
[1:15:07] can't why that kind of tree because this
[1:15:09] ministry was ordained and predestinated
[1:15:11] English of pain that God was looking for
[1:15:14] with our faith it is impossible to
[1:15:16] please God a mayor and the Bible goes on
[1:15:19] and says buffet table by faith no by
[1:15:22] faith Enoch by Vedas one Mary God did
[1:15:25] them the faith that please God clear day
[1:15:28] and for their out right on down to
[1:15:30] Lutheran best we the pedicles now the
[1:15:33] braid brother God give us a peace baby
[1:15:36] never give Luther that he never gave
[1:15:39] even the early Pentecostal Sunday
[1:15:40] because what God requires of us is clear
[1:15:44] and for beyond what is required of them
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:48] because they've gone on a man and the
[1:15:51] Bible says the dead in Christ will run
[1:15:53] first but they are waiting on us because
[1:15:56] the place although God said he said that
[1:15:58] in Christ is that are going to appear
[1:16:00] the lead Saints Oh are we walking the
[1:16:05] spirit are we living in the spirit to
[1:16:07] the extent Amen who this extract that
[1:16:10] delivered that the dead in Christ is
[1:16:12] gonna rise her to you you one of the
[1:16:15] conscious with that as I said this
[1:16:17] sometimes when I'm walking there
[1:16:19] somewhere and might have been in a more
[1:16:21] or go here going there and I see
[1:16:24] somebody oh it looks like submerged look
[1:16:30] at my brother burns oh you see sister
[1:16:36] coffee did that even come to heart come
[1:16:40] to your mind well the Bible says she
[1:16:44] wouldn't leave be going to be living in
[1:16:45] expectation there's we got to live in an
[1:16:47] expectation of the dead in Christ are
[1:16:50] paralyzed whether we got to be local
[1:16:52] something and I'm not just saying well
[1:16:54] looking will the rapture know you're
[1:16:55] gonna get a Christ rise first a man and
[1:16:59] we're gonna miss the resurrection of the
[1:17:01] dead in Christ will miss the rapture a
[1:17:04] man and brother and well how are we
[1:17:08] going to rise first
[1:17:09] how are they going to appear to it it's
[1:17:11] according to our faith it's according to
[1:17:15] a faith by the grace of Almighty God but
[1:17:19] I plan but if there's anything that God
[1:17:21] has done and God will do is history in
[1:17:24] word in this hour and that word brothers
[1:17:27] not revealing this mission this mystery
[1:17:29] of that mystery or this doctrine of this
[1:17:31] doctrine doctrine this organic is all
[1:17:33] gonna agree character catch them and as
[1:17:36] a worry with the with your the love of
[1:17:38] God yeah the divine little projects race
[1:17:41] and grace gives us faith that pleases
[1:17:44] God amen
[1:17:46] ray that's Ephesians amen the Novo God
[1:17:49] projects v Birds extra grace of God and
[1:17:52] the grace of God is the faith that God
[1:17:54] wants us to have amen and it's by grace
[1:17:57] through faith were saved and that number
[1:18:01] ourselves it is the gift of God and
[1:18:03] brother what God today is not our
[1:18:06] ourselves as not me it's not yours God's
[1:18:08] gift to us it was God's good to Israel
[1:18:12] in Egypt right
[1:18:14] and it got him out of Egypt but now
[1:18:16] God's always proposed to give them faith
[1:18:21] brother pay cometh by hearing hearing by
[1:18:24] the word God Joshua I can't hurt it amen
[1:18:30] I know that maybe even even when they're
[1:18:32] in Egypt they knew they knew the promise
[1:18:34] and they were claiming the promise are
[1:18:36] there was a generation raising they
[1:18:39] claimed the promise of God Lord he told
[1:18:41] Abraham you told him that would be in
[1:18:43] the bondage for 40 years when he wanted
[1:18:46] to lose a mate and take us into the
[1:18:50] Promised Land
[1:18:51] oh they got out but when they when they
[1:18:55] when they faced with the responsibility
[1:18:57] of going into the Promised Land they
[1:18:58] couldn't accept and the generation of
[1:19:02] believers can't accept the
[1:19:03] responsibility of going into the
[1:19:05] Promised Land
[1:19:06] no no no you God you do it you got you

[1:33:49] Catholic Church that in the Catholic
[1:33:51] Church but when he got out all it was
[1:33:52] different it was absurd ever when a
[1:33:55] coach to the Lutheran's they all thought

[1:33:59] they worshipped and praises the Lord
[1:34:01] a man Alan a man the same name with the
[1:34:04] Methodists andand and especially the
[1:34:06] pentose so he really thought the

[1:39:24] looking for you to apply the word to
[1:39:26] your life God is looking for you yep to

[1:39:51] brother the people will judge this
[1:39:54] person just brother judge this sister oh
[1:39:56] that that brother that's that sister
[1:39:57] what about yourself I tell you this if
[1:40:02] you're gonna just the airing of the word
[1:40:04] oh that's so
[1:40:05] other so that citrus tone so this one
[1:40:07] that's that oh you're not hearing it the
[1:40:10] way you should because you do your point
[1:40:13] to yourself oh yeah do you apply the
[1:40:19] word that you're hearing do your to your
[1:40:21] soul do you apply the word to your life
[1:40:24] and say is that me
[1:40:26] but I think it is you got to look at
[1:40:30] yourself the prophet of God said he said
[1:40:33] he said what's going on now he said God
[1:40:37] is judging us and he said the poor but
[1:40:42] hear this the pervert is the judgment
[1:40:46] seat it is I was judging you by the word
[1:40:55] and he said it is where God's power
[1:40:58] ought to be preached in the pulpit he
[1:41:03] said God is judging us
[1:41:06] he said that's what's going on right now
[1:41:11] God's judging you wrath oh yeah
[1:41:15] he is custom your attitude your spirit
[1:41:18] and motives your objectives thoughts
[1:41:20] words leads again again it's unfortunate
[1:41:23] that people just take the preaching of
[1:41:25] the word the preach of the message and
[1:41:26] they applied or that's the message and
[1:41:28] you know William Branham brought us all
[1:41:30] to that night your Lord for that yeah
[1:41:32] it's in the book but brother is it in
[1:41:34] you man God's not looking for it in the
[1:41:40] book do it in you when we go to glory it
[1:41:44] won't we won't bring books it's gonna be
[1:41:47] made flesh a merit by the grace of God
[1:41:51] praise the name of the Lord so buddy
[1:41:54] said the pulpit is the judgment seat it
[1:41:56] is we God's power ought to be preached
[1:42:00] amen that's exactly right
[1:42:03] he said judge yourself see the thing of
[1:42:07] it is let me ask you this question is
[1:42:08] the Word made flesh in your life not in
[1:42:12] your head his word made flesh in you see
[1:42:16] that's why the prophet of God nearing
[1:42:17] the end of ministry he knew
[1:42:19] when he preached to his own his own
[1:42:21] assembly preachers in church they said
[1:42:23] he said you got it in your heads but he
[1:42:26] says not your heart he's history they
[1:42:29] didn't I know many people I remember I
[1:42:32] got I said I can remember back there
[1:42:34] 1965 96 many believers added their heads
[1:42:39] but he'd never had it in their hearts
[1:42:41] hey man I knew that by their spirit by
[1:42:45] their attitude that's right
[1:42:47] then listen all due respect and that's
[1:42:49] why many times that I would go in church
[1:42:51] into fellowship back years and years and
[1:42:54] years ago almost 55 years ago and I
[1:42:57] would sit there and they would always
[1:43:00] wonder why why does that brother you
[1:43:03] know because I was I was a stranger to
[1:43:05] them and I was sort of odd because I I
[1:43:09] was to them all that that's the brother
[1:43:12] from st. John's could we lived in here
[1:43:14] at the time my family did and just as a
[1:43:19] 90 years old I go out there sometimes I
[1:43:22] not with oliday weekends or service and
[1:43:24] I I would sit just right over to himself
[1:43:28] and they didn't understand they said why
[1:43:30] does he do that I would start to praise
[1:43:33] the Lord and worship and so on and an a
[1:43:37] mister one time just recently an elderly
[1:43:41] sisters she's brothers she said I
[1:43:42] remember you as a young boy she said
[1:43:45] sitting over there she said in the
[1:43:47] church and she said oh yeah she said you
[1:43:50] stood out among the people
[1:43:51] well thank board and and your testimony
[1:43:54] and your witness and so on yeah but
[1:43:57] again I was discerning the spirit of a
[1:43:59] lot of this a lot of brothers sisters
[1:44:01] there and that's why like I said when I
[1:44:03] burn I preached and I know if I call
[1:44:08] preaching or not he just asked me to to
[1:44:11] get up and speak until it got dark why
[1:44:15] because they had to get dark for brother
[1:44:17] cater to show the fit on the prophet
[1:44:19] because the end that old the old
[1:44:22] fashioned one the big big real and so on
[1:44:26] and like I said I preached on Matthew
[1:44:28] chapter of D was five or six there and
[1:44:31] the last four or five verses
[1:44:33] it love them which love you what reward
[1:44:35] have you and just what back there in
[1:44:39] nineteen on a tional one it was but I
[1:44:41] preached ninety sixty six sixty eight
[1:44:44] whatever and and I said remembered you
[1:44:47] got to keep your attitude right you got
[1:44:49] to keep your skirt right I said even
[1:44:51] toward those out there I said there goes
[1:44:53] but for the grace of God amen
[1:44:56] grace for young grace for them yeah yeah
[1:45:01] and I guess said people have always
[1:45:03] remembered those things that I preached
[1:45:05] and many people would play from me
[1:45:07] because of what I was saying why because
[1:45:09] they were guilt of a wrong parent they
[1:45:12] had a wrong attitude and wrong shirt
[1:45:14] wrong mode along objectives oh thank the
[1:45:16] Lord for bringing us out of denomination
[1:45:18] see oh yeah thank you Lord we don't we
[1:45:20] got no more we don't have the command or
[1:45:22] control of a man anymore
[1:45:24] they didn't David they didn't believe
[1:45:25] the word God brought him out front under
[1:45:28] that control but he brought them under
[1:45:30] the troll of a ministry sure for God has
[1:45:34] said in the church for the perfecting of
[1:45:36] the saints for this for this for this
[1:45:41] yeah yeah I said lord I said they need
[1:45:47] the ghost they came out why believing
[1:45:51] the message being what the Prophet was
[1:45:53] saying about denominations and church
[1:45:55] but they weren't applying it to their
[1:45:58] own lives they were Jain those but they
[1:46:01] weren't judging themselves as the lord
[1:46:04] thank you for your growth in my life
[1:46:05] help me to humble myself as your son and
[1:46:09] daughter thank you for bringing me out a
[1:46:11] lord your grace to take me in a man so
[1:46:16] brother judge your help is the word my
[1:46:19] flesh in your life is the message flesh
[1:46:23] Union are you going out and in your
[1:46:25] thoughts and your words and your deeds
[1:46:27] actions and reactions are you reflecting
[1:46:31] the word the mess of the hour not rift
[1:46:36] in the church you come out of spirit and
[1:46:38] that anointing no not by any means
[1:46:44] it's one thing here it's one thing to
[1:46:49] intellectually agree with the word in
[1:46:51] your head but it's more real to you if
[1:46:54] you apply the word to your everyday
[1:46:57] living does it control you when you're
[1:47:04] at work y-yeah I don't care what time
[1:47:09] you're in you need that you need the
[1:47:11] word to be there and the engine and the
[1:47:13] spirit of the were with you to control
[1:47:16] you
[1:47:16] although matter what job I got involved
[1:47:18] in brother head I had to go listen
[1:47:20] whatever you do the Bible says they you
[1:47:22] know the believers they walk in the
[1:47:24] spirit and they live a spirit and
[1:47:26] brother I'll tell you this even if
[1:47:28] you're even if you're just working here
[1:47:30] work there working somewhere else you
[1:47:31] walk in the spirit you live in the
[1:47:33] spirit ethics of God amen
[1:47:36] but they're spinning dude this is
[1:47:38] walking this but when it comes to their
[1:47:39] doctrines and theology but when it come
[1:47:41] to the natural things of life there's
[1:47:43] walking in them in the flesh that's the
[1:47:47] truth our brothers got to be if you're
[1:47:49] better it's your sons and daughters of
[1:47:51] God it's got to be controlled by the
[1:47:53] Holy Ghost
[1:47:54] oh my I think there's not many not many
[1:47:57] under that aging not me with that kind
[1:48:00] of a baptism of the Holy Ghost in their
[1:48:02] souls
[1:48:03] not many listen are you a prisoner to
[1:48:10] word brother it's me say it again it's
[1:48:17] one thing to end it actually agree with
[1:48:18] what's being expressed yeah oh yeah
[1:48:22] that's Mitch I believe a seat yeah but
[1:48:24] judge yourself by it play to You Lord
[1:48:29] does that mean you're going to yeah
[1:48:33] sometimes you know that the Lord is
[1:48:35] ministry and he'd be talking to this
[1:48:37] person talking to that person and you
[1:48:39] think the preachers say something else
[1:48:40] in this study else and they say
[1:48:42] something else is somebody else yeah oh
[1:48:43] yeah don't think he just from the
[1:48:47] message most don't won't like though
[1:48:51] ministries today no this is it
[1:48:56] is one thing to intellectually agree
[1:48:59] with the thought being excess but how
[1:49:01] many are applying the word to their
[1:49:03] everyday live don't apply it to the
[1:49:06] ministry and Jada ministry from applied
[1:49:09] to other brothers and sisters and judge
[1:49:11] them a play it to yourself judge
[1:49:13] yourself and as the prophets say you
[1:49:17] judge yourself amen
[1:49:20] by the grace of God this come make sure
[1:49:25] make your calling and election sure make
[1:49:27] sure your to the word by the grace of
[1:49:30] God amen oh my grace listen I've shared
[1:49:39] it with you the last sermon share with
[1:49:41] you again because I think we need we
[1:49:44] need to get the reality of this
[1:49:46] revelation the melody of the hour that
[1:49:50] living the reality of what God is doing
[1:49:51] the reality of the apse here that we're
[1:49:54] living in by they said God amen
[1:50:08] like it gets it's it it gives me
[1:50:12] understanding and not just understanding
[1:50:16] but he give me peace no oh this is what
[1:50:20] this is what I'm experiencing this is
[1:50:23] what I'm seeing around this is more and
[1:50:26] more and more and again now I'm talking
[1:50:28] with Messi's churchism understand this
[1:50:34] again he said a fine minister a fine
[1:50:38] minister said a while ago he said
[1:50:43] brother Branham if I could sled the joy
[1:50:47] of the Lord in my heart a man why the
[1:50:55] spirit revival was gone

[1:51:01] revive was another and this be still and
[1:51:07] know that he's God and that he in
[1:51:10] control and brother venom responded to
[1:51:16] this brother this Minister and his son
[1:51:19] the revival is over now he said the

[1:52:08] us we know just beyond that wave yonder
[1:52:11] are nearing the shore and it is oh yeah
[1:52:15] the great fearful ways like I've
[1:52:17] witnessed over the years he said just
[1:52:21] stay stable just aim the word stay with
[1:52:25] God he said no matter how you feel what
[1:52:29] anything else stay right with the word
[1:52:31] he's let it stay stable a man he said we
[1:52:37] see great big clouds around us storms
[1:52:41] are coming yeah brother what are we
[1:52:43] seeing
[1:52:44] well we're seeing is getting worse and
[1:52:46] it's going to get worse the only thing
[1:52:51] that's gonna take us through it is are
[1:52:52] if they don't lose your faith I think
[1:52:57] you're gonna keep us in it and encourage
[1:52:59] the Senate keep moving on is our faith
[1:53:01] okay but again as I said God is changing
[1:53:05] our fate in the resurrection God has
[1:53:08] challenging our faith in the writer to
[1:53:09] read believe in the resurrection do you
[1:53:13] really believe in the rapture do you
[1:53:14] really believe the kingdom of God the
[1:53:18] king the land was more real Joshua and
[1:53:22] Caleb than Egypt you know what because
[1:53:26] just in Egypt saved out of Egypt but in
[1:53:32] the promised land God with her a man
[1:53:36] with a promise to bless him pray the
[1:53:39] Lord but yet Egypt was more ritu the
[1:53:42] other Jews than the promised land all
[1:53:46] should have left us in Egypt let's go
[1:53:48] back to Egypt what after all they
[1:53:51] experienced they want to go back to
[1:53:53] Egypt yeah thinking that maybe they went
[1:53:56] back to Pharaoh be more cut with no
[1:54:00] Saints till the God of Egypt saying we
[1:54:06] still truly need you and Satan is the
[1:54:10] god of this world but our real is it to
[1:54:13] us
[1:54:14] see those things got to get more and
[1:54:17] more wood you don't you don't get the
[1:54:19] layers together just to do it and used
[1:54:20] to it and used to this spirit used to
[1:54:23] that shirt used to all these things
[1:54:24] foolish things are going on in this
[1:54:25] world no no God allowing all that he
[1:54:28] gives us the revelation of it to know
[1:54:29] what it is or for the creating us a
[1:54:32] great hunger and a greater thirst for
[1:54:33] eternity greater hunger greater thirst
[1:54:38] for the kingdom of God we're in right
[1:54:42] now were physic we're in the kingdom of
[1:54:44] the devil he's the god of this world and
[1:54:47] he has come down with great wrath he
[1:54:51] knows time is short how many Christians
[1:54:55] favours know their time is short a man
[1:55:01] he says stay stable saying the word they
[1:55:05] with God no matter how you feel what are

[1:55:12] stay stable and he said when you see all
[1:55:15] these could big clouds around us storms
[1:55:18] coming atomic buffs and everything else

[1:55:24] is straight in the word he said God said
[1:55:27] it would be here and will crest every
[1:55:30] one of them yay said we will go right at
[1:55:33] the top of them and they said they can't

[1:57:36] where you go okay now he said don't look
[1:57:38] to the left or to the right moving
[1:57:40] forward yeah because why he noticed
[1:57:43] there were others there on that path and
[1:57:45] they were going this way they were going
[1:57:47] that way and they were going out here
[1:57:48] went out there yeah but he said you keep
[1:57:51] going forward

[2:07:20] rock of the real world
[2:07:22] amen our Lord Jesus Christ and when
[2:07:26] the Rose de stream beat vehemently upon
[2:07:29] the house and did not shake it for it
[2:07:32] was founded on a rock but he said he
[2:07:36] that error than do not he said as the
[2:07:39] command that it without a foundation
[2:07:42] building house upon earth against which
[2:07:45] the dream did beat the eminently and

[2:08:34] prisoner and listen again as I said many
[2:08:40] feel that they believe what secretes
[2:08:44] because they're believers in the message
[2:08:47] again they believe in their heads but
[2:08:50] not in the heart but the thing that is
[2:08:54] that whatever is being reach the first
[2:08:56] they do is take it and apply it to your
[2:08:59] own if you don't condemn the others
[2:09:02] you'll plot yourself by the grace of a
[2:09:06] man and brother if you want to be a
[2:09:09] witness to others if not thing to say o
[2:09:13] condemned them condemn them no leave
[2:09:16] your life for them you want to let them
[2:09:19] know they should or shouldn't do didn't
[2:09:21] you do it in real it in your flesh your
[2:09:26] attitude your spirit your words actions
[2:09:28] your reaction oh yeah if there's
[2:09:31] anything that they seek they people will
[2:09:33] see that and they'll know if you read
[2:09:36] this way and you talk this way back this
[2:09:38] way or
[2:09:39] yeah they don't know who do you draft
[2:09:42] her you should have lost her father no I
[2:09:45] don't yeah I turned after my heavy
[2:09:47] father oh yes they would believe that
[2:09:51] yeah because you're really company
[2:09:53] father's attitude that's how much your
[2:09:58] faith make your calling and election
[2:10:01] sure how make sure you're born again
[2:10:09] he's Paul he was trained by the hollows
[2:10:16] to wit on the word he was trained by
[2:10:21] Holy Spirit to wait upon the Lord no
[2:10:26] matter what his ambitions were or going
[2:10:30] to I hope by the Holy Spirit show you
[2:10:33] Sonny now he said let's take an instance
[2:10:36] one day Paul and Silas come down a
[2:10:39] street in a certain city he said where
[2:10:42] he was only in a Bible and a little
[2:10:45] demon possessed girl kept following him
[2:10:47] crying out after him and Noah but what
[2:10:50] Paul knew that he the authority as an
[2:10:53] apostle to rebuke that evil spirit out
[2:10:56] of that woman but did you notice he
[2:11:00] waited day after day oh he could have
[2:11:05] turned around says you don't come out of
[2:11:07] her no he waited on the Lord he made it
[2:11:11] there's a reason that he had the wheat
[2:11:14] and he said until all of a sudden he
[2:11:19] said the Holy Spirit spoke to him and he
[2:11:22] said this is the hour and he said though
[2:11:25] spirit come over she knew to wait on the
[2:11:31] Lord how many of us are going to wait on
[2:11:33] God or that God taught you grace wait on
[2:11:40] the Lord now many of waiting on God to
[2:11:42] go and do what they want to regardless
[2:11:44] wait on the Lord wait I say on the Lord
[2:11:48] hey man
[2:11:50] there is were so many people he said na
[2:11:53] he sir bring a reproach upon word he
[2:11:56] should they go out there with ambition
[2:11:58] and how many rivals have been left flat
[2:12:01] because of a thing like that because the
[2:12:04] Evangelist doesn't wait to see what the
[2:12:06] Lord's got to say yeah
[2:12:11] how many I won't mention a name but I
[2:12:16] only have been deceived by a certain
[2:12:17] evangelist out there for 40 over 40
[2:12:24] years he's been ministry over 40 years
[2:12:29] he's been deceiving the people well 40
[2:12:33] years begging as it were for their
[2:12:35] finances into the billion dollars in 40
[2:12:41] years and it and having such a such
[2:12:44] element of people to the extent that he
[2:12:48] oh I've see for years on certain
[2:12:50] pictures or films or whatever and he go
[2:12:53] over there all over the congregation and
[2:12:56] all over the audiences people and go and
[2:12:58] oh they fall down they gonna fall down
[2:13:02] one time I saw where he did it did it
[2:13:04] did it oh ma
[2:13:05] it was a you talk about a pile of human
[2:13:09] people one one foot lane back onto your
[2:13:13] lane back on the other as if they were
[2:13:15] there I laid there leaving the
[2:13:17] impression they were laying by the Holy
[2:13:18] Spirit they weren't I guarantee you that
[2:13:22] and now just over the last few years a
[2:13:26] relative of that evangelist has been
[2:13:29] preaching against that he says that's
[2:13:32] not God
[2:13:33] he preaching against it because he was
[2:13:36] also a part of it
[2:13:37] and he said he said there were others he
[2:13:39] said if they were really really sick
[2:13:42] people he said oh yeah they were there
[2:13:44] were there were those there maybe he
[2:13:46] might on one of them and they will let
[2:13:47] those real sick people go and go in the
[2:13:50] prayer line just people that we could
[2:13:53] walk in the laner or they if they wanted
[2:13:56] to experience this experience that oh
[2:13:58] that's it yeah brother what they wanted
[2:14:02] was he
[2:14:04] I know there was times when on her in
[2:14:07] any Costard there were Jewish brothers
[2:14:09] and sisters that were slaying my spirit
[2:14:12] my brother it wasn't the preacher did it
[2:14:14] God did it because I remember even even
[2:14:18] in when I was in Pentecost and we
[2:14:20] gathering up around the altar and I was
[2:14:23] one of them up there around the other we
[2:14:25] were praising the Lord and and I was
[2:14:27] raised and I noticed this sir came up
[2:14:30] and she walked up and she just she just
[2:14:33] stood in front of the altar then all of
[2:14:36] a sudden
[2:14:36] nobody touched her she she fell back off
[2:14:43] or she was slain by the spirit oh yeah
[2:14:49] and after a while then she was stirred
[2:14:51] she'd come back again yeah I remember
[2:14:53] years and years ago when I was just home
[2:14:56] and even even one time my grandmother my
[2:14:59] father's mother and and she and she was
[2:15:02] in in the Salvation Army and when all of
[2:15:05] a sudden she was up around the altar I
[2:15:07] believe at the time and all of a sudden
[2:15:09] she went up and they thought she said
[2:15:14] yeah that's what they thought because
[2:15:16] they works to that but she was slain by
[2:15:18] the spirit only yet they took her and
[2:15:21] they held on to her and order to finally
[2:15:24] she came back to her off again yeah
[2:15:28] slaying by the shirt but this evangelist
[2:15:31] for forty over forty years he's been
[2:15:33] even even that's been a witness of him
[2:15:36] well then if that's this evangelist a
[2:15:38] very righteous but now one of his own
[2:15:40] relics is condemning it he said that's
[2:15:43] not God he said like this eyewitness
[2:15:46] said and they which they would not allow
[2:15:48] real real ski with a net prayer line and
[2:15:50] there was one woman there that that they
[2:15:53] interviewed and and that she was one of
[2:15:56] those that went to go into that
[2:15:57] Beuerlein that wouldn't let her go oh no
[2:16:01] she wasn't
[2:16:02] it was really something wrong with her
[2:16:05] in your chair and even the way that she
[2:16:07] was she was she was formed and so on and
[2:16:11] no they know they would say just take
[2:16:14] her sides they where the Lord bless you
[2:16:17] the grace of God to you that's it yeah
[2:16:20] yeah even today as many many years ago
[2:16:23] but even today she still did the
[2:16:25] wheelchair she said notion they wouldn't
[2:16:27] let me go into light he said I know now
[2:16:31] she wasn't gone so I leave it with the
[2:16:35] Lord
[2:16:35] yeah grace of God to her oh yes she
[2:16:39] still in the wheels
[2:16:40] she still formed like that I thought but
[2:16:44] she's still pressing on her faith in God
[2:16:46] oh my brother god help us is my prayer
[2:16:50] so don't get to see by that yet
[2:16:55] I guess that evangelist might might be a
[2:16:57] millionaire
[2:16:58] oh yeah many many many millions that he
[2:17:02] got from the people Oh send this send
[2:17:04] this this he goes sometimes goes around
[2:17:06] the world God have mercy on us pray god
[2:17:09] help us
[2:17:11] amen and I know some time some years ago
[2:17:15] years ago a certain evangelist sent me
[2:17:17] sent me pictures like that and it wasn't
[2:17:19] that of that that preacher and it was
[2:17:22] this preacher in a certain country and
[2:17:24] he sent me on it to me and I saw this
[2:17:26] and I saw that they were doing this they
[2:17:28] were ruined that in that country and I
[2:17:31] said brother dear brother please don't
[2:17:33] smiie those things again i said that is
[2:17:36] not scriptural I said the Bible tells us
[2:17:39] that when John the Revelator saw Jesus
[2:17:42] he fell as one dead before fate and I
[2:17:45] said Jesus didn't leave him there Jesus
[2:17:47] reached on us to stand on you know he
[2:17:50] said I'm doing I'm this and that I said
[2:17:53] he does he's not there to do this not
[2:17:56] there to do that I see it there to give
[2:17:59] us life I saw on I said brother don't
[2:18:02] you go preaching those things would you
[2:18:04] go teaching those things that's not
[2:18:06] scriptural God is not going you didn't
[2:18:10] see that in the menís Ministry of
[2:18:11] William Branham you didn't see that in
[2:18:13] the Ministry of War Roberts and other
[2:18:15] evangelists no no way not by any means
[2:18:17] no they come into line God we got prayed
[2:18:21] they pray for them and God healed them
[2:18:23] they went on praising the Lord everybody
[2:18:25] out in the praising the Lord Amen to God
[2:18:28] be the glory
[2:18:31] they're giving the glory man but not to
[2:18:34] God amen so brother Paul he waited on
[2:18:40] the Lord and he said there's where amid
[2:18:44] so many people they bring a report on
[2:18:46] the word they go out with ambition
[2:18:49] should how many revivals has been left
[2:18:51] flat because of a thing like that
[2:18:54] because the Evangelist doesn't wait to
[2:18:56] see what the Lord's got say and he says
[2:18:59] some of them say come over here and go
[2:19:02] right now because the Association says
[2:19:05] go the Holy Spirit was same thing
[2:19:07] different yet the ambition of the man
[2:19:09] easier to become the staff press better
[2:19:12] or to become or something ornery says
[2:19:14] some elder some big or he said you eat
[2:19:17] he's the Holy Spirit saying go here yet
[2:19:21] is Luke 2 is organization and he is
[2:19:26] prisoner to his organization but it is
[2:19:30] joke to Christ he led by the Holy Spirit
[2:19:33] is yoked a prisoner to Christ they did
[2:19:38] am any difference what anything else
[2:19:40] says it's a sounding brass a tinkling
[2:19:43] ship he hears the voice only the voice
[2:19:46] rod and he speak only when it comes out
[2:19:49] he says nothing
[2:19:50] amen grace he said brother branham your
[2:19:58] convene what you said sunday about you
[2:20:01] and waiting all this time but you
[2:20:04] remember it was the Holy Spirit that
[2:20:06] spoke to me up here on the room and said
[2:20:08] I'm sending you back among the sick of
[2:20:10] the afflict man this was God instructing
[2:20:14] brother met him to go back to evangelism
[2:20:17] because when it comes to the call of his
[2:20:23] life for the Ministry of the word and
[2:20:25] the old the mystery of God the seven
[2:20:26] seals it was a niche it was done and God
[2:20:30] let him go on for other two years
[2:20:32] because there were still some things he
[2:20:35] did say he said another revelation on
[2:20:38] this on the Bevan seat and so on this
[2:20:42] revelation that revelry
[2:20:43] then when Gaul finish he took him off
[2:20:46] the scene now brother yes what is it now
[2:20:51] God has laid it in our lap the Prophet
[2:20:55] is not here no more but God has laid the
[2:20:57] revealed word in the lap of the bride
[2:20:59] what's she gonna do with it and God
[2:21:02] after all these years God has proven
[2:21:05] what we're doing it and God is watching
[2:21:08] and I was looking to see what we're
[2:21:10] doing to see it's controlled in our
[2:21:12] lives by the grace of God are we
[2:21:16] prisoners to read a word grace let's
[2:21:26] take the character of Moses he was born
[2:21:30] a deliverer but before I say about Moses
[2:21:34] he said like to make this statement that
[2:21:37] God always has to take any man that will
[2:21:40] serve Him truly to be prisoner a man as
